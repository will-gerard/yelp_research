Great local place that we eat at regularly (usually take-out). Most of the restaurants in Anthem suck but this one stands out and has been a staple for us for the last 8+ years we have lived here.  First of all let me say that their house mustard rocks. If taking out, don't settle for packets but ask for house mustard. Your eyes will pop out.  Hot and Sour soup is good; fantastic Moo Shu and love the Triad in One (beef, chicken and jumbo prawns). Also if you are a drinker, the Volcano will knock your socks off. Make sure you have a DD. ;-)

After having to endure a nasty Mexican food restaurant in Anthem of which I will be gracious enough to not mention their name, Roberto's is a breath of fresh air. I love the fact that their food is authentic Mexican food and not what I refer to as "gringoized."   They make everything fresh daily and the prices aren't to bad either. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone that lives or is up in Anthem.

Absolutely love the "Mexico City" style of food which seems tastier and healthier than most Mexican food restaurants. It doesn't weigh as heavy on you.  Not the greatest location in the world but ambiance inside is good. Definitely a local favorite.

We sat at the bar and bartender did a great job serving us. The fried calamari is to die for - nice and tender and not rubbery as in many places. We also did the wok-fried curry noodles which were fantastic.   Dragon Noodle is a great place within the Monte Carlo Hotel and casino to enjoy oriental food away from the noise and smoke of the casino.

We try to stay somewhere different every time we go to Vegas and because this time, we only planned to stay one night on our way home from a California trip, I didn't want to spend a lot.  After searching Kayak, our three choices for decent lodging along with budget pricing was Monte Carlo, Rio or Paris Las Vegas. Both the Rio and Paris Las Vegas had mixed reviews while Monte Carlo seemed to be higher end. So we opted for a strip view room at the Monte Carlo.  Now first of all, don't be fooled by "strip view." Sure you can see some of the strip however the hotel is not located directly on the strip itself but set back quite a ways. So your view is limited.  I was also a bit disappointed with the dated room - its furnishings and decor. There was no refrigerator or even an honors bar (money making opportunity here) and the shower fixture was pretty gotty looking. I know I'm being a bit particular here but after staying at the Wynn last year, the Monte Carlo was disappointing.   The hallway where our room was located (23rd floor) smelt like a skunk had been there. I'm not sure if it was actual skunk or someone smoking some skunk weed in one of the rooms. ;-)  Finally, waiting about 10 minutes for the elevator to finally stop on our floor during check-out time was all but ridiculous. I felt like I was waiting for a theme park ride without the theming or the thrills.  All that being said, I don't think the Monte Carlo is a bad place for those looking for budget accommodations. I just know I won't be going back because there are much better places to stay for the same price range.  A positive is that it looks like they have a wonderful pool area including wave pool and lazy river. Due to time's sake, we did not get to experience these but if you have kids in Vegas, looks like a cool place for them.

I'm a simple kind of man... every time I go to the Carnegie Deli in The Mirage, I am there for one thing and one thing only - the hot pastrami on rye. Add some swiss cheese and your in heaven.   A word of advice however - share a sandwich or eat half and take home the other half for later. They are freakin huge!  A staple every time we visit Las Vegas!

We will never stay on the Las Vegas strip again, that is as long as we do not have to. During our latest trip to Las Vegas, my wife purchased a 5 night stay at the Wyndam Grand Desert resort from a timeshare owner for just $395! That might have been what we would have paid for any decent room on the strip but what we got at the Wyndam was so much more.  - 2 bedroom suite w/ full kitchen, dining & living areas, jetted tub - Didn't have to walk trough smokey, stinky casino to get to room - 3 swimming pools to choose from - Lack of crowds - Off strip but still close enough to walk - Like-home accommodations  This place is great. I'm not saying to go out and buy a Las Vegas timeshare but if you can find someone who is selling their time-slot, for whatever reason and it works out with your travel plans, then by all means check this place out.  We were able to save money on our trip by utilizing the full kitchen meaning we didn't have to go out all the time to the over-priced Vegas restaurants. And with two full baths, 3 televisions, two bedrooms, a decent size living area, and more, relaxing in the room was a pleasant experience.  Next time we come to Vegas, we will look for a place here again, or at least something very similar.

The last time we stayed here was much better than this time. The resort is still awesome but the particular room we were in this time was less than stellar.  Here is what broke or went wrong:  - Refrigerator not cold enough. Had to put stuff in freezer just to  keep refrigerator cool.  - Had to hold down toilet lever to get it to flush. I know - anal but all the same, not what you expect of a resort.  - Agitator in washing machine detached.  - Lint trap in dryer fell out (broken).  - We were in a ADA room which is fine but weird shower configuration for one who is not disabled - no door.  - Drain in shower clogged. Wifey had to pause shower to get it to drain.  We thought of contacting management to fix or switch us but decided to hang it out. So, still love this place but maybe they need to start upgrading/fixing some things.

This Cold Stone Creamer should be called "not so cold stone creamery." Paid $6 for a slushy milkshake-like waffle cone. To top it all; waffle cone stale. Never again!

We should have listened to our first intuition and hit up the pizza joint next door. However, we didn't and decided to try this place instead.  The chips were good and that is about it. The salsa that accompanies the chips, which by the way you have to pay almost $6 for was unimpressive. Then they charged us another $1 when we asked for more salsa to finish the initial quantity of chips that were supplied. What a rip-off.  My wife ordered the taquitos which seemed just like the cheap ones you can buy in any grocer freezer (not home made). She refused to eat them and fortunately to their credit, they removed them from the bill.  I had the street tacos which were okay but nothing to write home about.   I can't speak for the quality of the booze that is served here as we went for lunch so maybe they serve good drinks. I dunno but a place like this wouldn't survive in my town.  Oh, and by the way, after leaving here, we did go to the pizza place next door which was fantastic (another review).

The Italian Beef is just wonderful with generous portion of beef and delicious, spicy peppers. Make sure to get it "wet" or juicy as opposed to dry. I also love the Gyros plate. A favorite of ours time and time again.

Fantastic New York style pizza! That's pretty much says it all. We went back a second time and my wife went a third. That's how good it is.   Try it yourself when in Vegas and see if it doesn't make you feel like you are in New York eating the real thing!

If you want to see a comedy magic show on a budget while in Las Vegas, this is a great show to see. The quality is phenomenal for the price. $30 got the wife and I in the very front row at The Flamingo Theater where several folks right around us got pulled into the act.   The quality of the illusions was great and what really added even more value to the show was the two guests Nathan brought in from other shows. Not only did it break up the routine of trick after trick, it added some tremendous comical moments to the show, one of which had most everybody about peeing their pants with laughter.  It was so good, I'll probably see it again on our next trip to Vegas, even if it is the same. Nathan Burton Comedy Magic Show - highly recommended.

Best New York Pizza I've had in the metro Phoenix area. The  Pasta Giovanni is to die for! Absolute loved the "tomato cream demi-glaze sauce with a hint of garlic & red pepper."   While an Italian eatery, they also serve up a pretty mean American style breakfast with some of the best breakfast sausage I've ever tasted. Can't wait to go back again and again and again!  Finally they have a great happy hour that runs from 2pm - 6 pm with discounts on drinks and $100 a slice cheeses pizza. Mmmm!

The Tom Kha Gai is to die for. I pick it up weekly to enjoy at home. I also love their Pad Thai, Crispy Shrimp and Cashew Chicken.   While many of the eateries in Anthem are sub-par, Dara Thai stands out among them. Even if I didn't live in Anthem, it would be worth the drive for their fantastic Thai cuisine.

Every since these guys got busted having illegal workers, the legal ones suck. They do a lot more talking and standing around than working.

If your beer of choice is Coors Lite, Bud Lite or any other wannabe beers in this type of category, don't go to the Freakin Frog.   On the other hand if you fashion yourself as a "beer connoisseur," the Freakin Frog is the place to be. They have something like 600+ beers available by the bottle and a dozen or so from the tap.  They also have 700+ whiskeys available in the attic section of the bar. We were able to view the Whiskey Room but stuck to several different types of beers during our visit. The staff is super friendly and helpful if you want to better educate your knowledge of beer and whiskey.  They typically have live musical entertainment nightly but we visited around 4pm and didn't stay long enough to see any live bands. Maybe the next Vegas trip!  So, if you want to visit a very unique place, not far from the Vegas strip with a huge selection of beers and wiskeys, and very good "bar food" as well, check out The Freakin' Frog.

Havana Cigars not only sports the largest walk-in humidor in Arizona, the store itself is a great place to hang out and enjoy a fine cigar. With the free WiFi they offer, I call this place my office away from the office. The owner is super friendly and is great about throwing events that draw in the local crowd of cigar connoisseurs.  Unless I'm out of town, Havana Cigars it is the only place I'll go to buy fine cigars.

An excellent place to get Greek food. Love the Gyros plates as well as the Baklava. So glad that we have an authentic Greek restaurant/market so close to home.   Most definitely a regular eatery for us.

Very mediocre Gringo-style Mexican Food. Save some dollars and go to Taco Bell.   Portions small as well. Medium salsa was good but tamales were very hard.

First of all I love the way they quote work and that is by the actual pieces of furniture and types they are moving and not by number of movers, hours, etc. In this manner it was very easy to understand what the costs would be before committing.  Tim showed up with a four man crew and they did an excellent job taking care of our stuff. Nothing was damaged and everything was protected very well. All pieces arrived safely at their destination which was 45 city miles away.   Tim and his staff were extremely friendly and really made the process of moving one of ease. I highly recommend them and although i don't plan on moving again anytime soon, I would definitely use these guys again.

What originally attracted me to this show was the big cats. I love cats of all sizes.. especially the big wild ones. And to see a magic show that combines magic with wild cats... well I just couldn't miss this.   We probably could have scored free tickets as my wife found the act advertised in one of those Vegas tourist mags. However we opted for the VIP tickets at right around $60. That put us in front row but like I say, even if you are in the back row, I think that's only 6 or so away from stage (very small venue).  The magic was decent - typical of magic shows. What sets this show apart from other magic acts is the cats. We were literally 20 -40 feet away from the at any given time. No need to worry though as they are all chained and/or in cages so there really is no chance that they be able to lunge out at the audience, even if someone looked like a tasty meal for these massive carnivores.  I gave show 4 stars not necessarily for the quality but rather the big cats and Dirk's conservation work with them.

We just love this place! Great atmosphere, awesome happy hour, and the best tacos anywhere. We live in Ahwatukee which is about 45 miles away from this place. However every time we are in the north Phoenix area, I'm like let's go to Popos.  Highly recommend for Happy Hour in the bar which runs 3pm to 7pm and then reverse from 9pm to close.  Hungry? Take advantage of the Monday  "all you can eat tacos/tostadas" special.

My garage is no longer boring but with its new IronDrive coating. In fact, it feels like any other room in the house.  As I was checking various providers of garage floor coatings, Shane from sales did an excellent job explaining IronDrive's process, showing me samples of their work and answering all my questions.   On the day of the install, Shannon (the owner) and Dave did a very thorough job laying down the garage floor coating, making sure to first grind the surface so the IronDrive coating would have a good bond. The whole process took about 8 hours and my cars were back in the garage 48 hours later.   I love my new garage as well as the fact that they offer a Lifetime Warranty on their product..

Seth from Bulwark was awesome! He was very courteous and professional and did a thorough job spraying our property for Scorpion control. I'd highly recommend Builwark in dealing with annoying pests, especially scorpions.

Windshield guy talked me into getting windshield replaced when getting my Titan washed and gave me 4 VIP car washes for free. When I went to use first one, cashier said coupon s the guy gave me were never activated and they could not honor. Therefore I had to pay for car wash. What's ironic is that I wouldn't even come here because it's way out of my way and go to Cobblestone regularly.  Even with the name change from Danny's Car Wash to Jacksons, they are still crooks!
