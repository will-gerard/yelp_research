This is our go to sushi/ramen place when we're in the area. Dynamite California roll is almost always a 5$ special and that's like a meal in itself and delicious.   I love the spicy miso ramen. Meat is so tender juicy and flavorful. Noodles are good, broth is good, can have a little more flavor though. This time the broth had good spicy flavor but not much other flavor. Good portions, ramen is more than enough to fill me.   The spicy allstar roll and eel and avocado rolls are also pretty good.   Good value for good food. Although go early or late. Kind of a small place so when it's busy the wait can be quite a while.

Mm. No.   Pros: cheap shaved ice with many toppings. The small size was 6$ which was more than enough to feed 1 big guy and 2 girls. We didn't finish it, but I think it's more cuz we didn't like it that much. Shaved ice has honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberries, red beans, condensed milk, mochi pieces.   They serve ramen, saw two customers there with ramen. Not sure if it was more freshly made or made from a packet.   Cons: they keep the place so cold you don't really feel like eating your shaved ice. And still the ice melts so fast, it quickly becomes a milky soup with ice chunks plus fruit. The red bean drink + boba was also just okay. Nothing impressive or too enjoyable. Also the place just looks and feels grungy/dirty.   However, have a friend that recommended this place and really likes it. Try if you're into it!

Been here in Houston, DC, and now Scottsdale. Good. Every. Time.  First, the pao de queijo is so good. Warm, soft, fluffy, slightly cheesy but not to heavy, I could eat them all night if I didn't have a lot of meat to devour later.  The sides, the bananas, fried polenta, mashed potatoes. I only ate the fried polenta, which is crispy deliciousness and not too salty, but my friends had the bananas and potatoes and liked those a lot.  Meat. Well, there's a lot. If it's your first time, I suggest you try A LITTLE BIT of everything to find out what you like, then just get those items. Considering it's more than 50$ a person, It's pretty much what you have to do to make it worthwhile. Since I've already done that, my go-tos are the lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped filet mignon (probably only get 1-2, bacon, while delicious, tends to get heavy), and filet mignon. My husband really likes bottom sirloin too, which I'll also get if I'm in the mood.  The salad bar is also super awesome!! Which I would suggest eating at the end of your meal to make the most of your stomach space for the meat. There's this heart of something (forgot what it was) that looks kinda like a bamboo shoot (same color, shape) but it's not hollow. It's got a light sour taste to it (like artichoke hearts) and the outside texture is kinda like artichoke hearts, but the middle is almost creamy. If you like that flavor and texture, def try it. I have no idea what it is but I like it! Other than that, fruit's pretty good, they had prepared orange and grapefruit slices which is a huge plus if you've ever eating a grapefruit.  They also have a salad bar only option if you have vegetarian friends/family. I think that's about 30$ or so? Still a bit selection.  Service is good too! The meat handlers may feel a bit pushy, but don't hesitate to say no if you don't want what they're offering. There are also floor managers making sure that if there's ever a lull in your meat service that they get you what you want.  If you haven't been and have money, goooooo!!!!!

So. Much. Fun. Doesn't matter if you're old young or in between, I believe this is safe, affordable fun for all ages.   Went here for my dad's birthday, went with mom dad husband and myself. We arrived on a non holiday weekend, noon Saturday, and it was kinda busy, our wait was about half an hour, so we decided to eat first. After we ordered, don't remember how long that was, we got our text saying that our bay was ready and that we could also eat at the bay. Yay!  Went to the bay, our appetizers were there: macaroni egg rolls and wings. Eggrolls of Mac n cheese was such a neat idea and the green chili in it made it really good and not too heavy as you'd think fried mac n cheese would be! Wings were fine, nothing stellar. We also got burgers. Those were fine, got Mac daddy and sunrise. Mac daddy seemed a bit much as far as being heavy, or maybe I had had my fill of Mac n cheese..anyway, we concluded that when we come back we'd just order snacks / appetizers and not burgers. Might try other stuff? Tots were good!  Golfing! So fun. It's kinda like bowling where you take your turn and watch others take theirs, but unless one of your is a real golf guru, it's pretty funny to watch your group. Not as easy as it looks and I definitely have more respect for golfers now =p Anyway, 4 people, 2 hours, 60$, not bad! Plus there's a lounge (I didn't go to) and food if you wanted to kill more time there.   At least try it once! It's fun!
