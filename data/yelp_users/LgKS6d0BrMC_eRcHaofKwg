Can I just tell you how much I love Liberty Market?!?!?!  My favorite, favorite, favorite thing there is the Caprese Pasta Salad...to die for!  They also make a pretty darn good Egg Salad Sandwich, oh and let's not forget those Raspberry Scones with the cream to dip them in! The staff has always been very nice and helpful.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but it's totally worth it.

First let me say that I love, love, love, love this store!  There are so many things to choose from & it's my go to place for gifts for kids (since discovering it & it's sister store, Baby Stop, about 10 months ago right after my son was born).  My favorite event so far is the fill-a-bag sale they have every February...this was my first year, I can tell you that I WILL be back next year & the year after that & the year after that until they no longer have this sale!  It's already on my calendar for 2015!  Holy smokes did I get a TON of stuff for very little money!   Kate, the owner is just an absolute doll & I love the fact that she brings her beautiful dogs, Murphee & McGuire to the stores with her!

We have been going here for years and I have no idea why I have not posted a review until now! Not once have we ever had a bad experience!  We love to go on the weekends when it's cool enough, listen to live music, have drinks and that delightful Creme Brulee. This is a place we like to take out of town guests, they are never disappointed.

Let me first say that IF I was able to give ZERO stars I would for this restaurant.  Apparently, they do not read their reviews, as if they did maybe things would change...MAYBE!  My husband and I decided to try El Charro out for the first time on Saturday, we were very much looking forward to trying this so called "Mesa Gem" since it is very close to our home.  Upon entering the building we were greeted by the hostess, she told us it would be about a 10 minute wait, and if we wanted, we could go in the lounge for drinks & they would come get us when our table was ready.  We proceeded to the lounge and after a couple minutes the bartender came and took our order.  She asked us if we would like chips & salsa while we waited and we told her that would be great, well she NEVER BROUGHT THEM.  Several minutes later she finally came back to check on us, and I asked her if the hostess would come and get us back here and she assured us they would, she then let us know that we could just eat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait on a table, we decided that would be great since we were very hungry, and she said "I will get you some menus"...since it was taking forever for her to grab a couple menus I decided to go to the front and see how long it was until we got our table since we had already been waiting over 20 minutes.  When I asked, they said "we called you at 6:51 and you didn't answer"...I politely told them that we were in the lounge and were assured that someone would come get us when our table was ready, the hostess apologized and said she will work on getting us a table right away.  I went back to the lounge and sat back down, three other patrons came in, were seated, given chips and salsa right away, and drinks were being poured all the while we sat with NO SERVICE!  The bartender finally came back after 10 minutes of ignoring us and asked "so, do you want to eat in here?", we said "we told you 10 minutes ago that we wanted to eat in here and you went to get menus and never came back, so no, we have decided to leave since we are getting terrible service", she looked at us, gave a nasty dirty look and walked off. Needless to say, we will NEVER return to this place.  How it has been in business for over 34 years is beyond me.  Never in my life have I ever been treated so poorly at a restaurant. I truly hope that this review helps others in their decision, don't be like us and give them the benefit of the doubt despite quite a few bad reviews.

I started visiting Dr. Reed within his first year of practice & I will NEVER ever go to another chiropractor!  He has helped me with so many issues over the years. I had a very difficult pregnancy in 2012/2013 & he provided the most exceptional chiropractic care to me to help me through it with as little discomfort as possible, for that I am forever grateful to him.

I had the opportunity to get cupcakes from Wicked about a week ago and let me tell you...they are sooooo good.  The Red Velvet is one of the best I have ever had, the Green Tea was so different and so yummy, and the "hot" Chocolate...well, let's just say it has some heat to it.  It was delicious, but be prepared for the bite of the pepper!  I was lucky enough to attend a cupcake class at Sur La Table that was being taught by the owner Slade Grove and it was by far one of the best classes I have ever taken.  He is so funny, very easy to talk to, and has great tips and tricks!  If you ever get the chance to take a class with him...DO IT!

This little gem of a store was recommended to be by a few of my girlfriends and boy am I glad I went and checked it out.  I have bought several gifts there and have never been disappointed. I received a necklace and charm for my baby shower from a friend and sadly the chain broke after just a couple times wearing it.  I took it to a jeweler and they said that unfortunately because of where it broke that it couldn't be fixed.  I took it back to Frances to see if there was anything they could do, and they replaced it immediately.  I was so impressed with their customer service and I will continue to shop here for many years to come.

I normally wouldn't rate a Taco Bell, but I think it's important to do so on this particular location.  I stopped for a quick bite on my way home from a delivery in Anthem.  I ordered a Mexican Pizza, when I took my first bite, I immediately knew something was not right, it tasted like it had been fried in rancid oil.  Gross!  I took it back in & the kid from the drive thru came over & I told him it tasted like it was cooked in rancid oil, he took it back & I heard him tell the manager & they actually said "well, it probably was."  What?!?!?  Are you kidding me?!?!?  The manager did not come out to talk to me, just sent the kid from the drive thru.  He says what else do you want, I ordered a taco & a nacho & they didn't even give me the money difference back & didn't even apologize.  Ridiculous!

We have used this cleaner for several years and have always been happy with how our clothes turn out.  Great pride and care are taken and it is evident.  Service is top notch and the turnaround is very quick. They also do alterations, and I can say the same about that as I have above about the dry cleaning.

I cannot say enough good things about Su Vino Winery.  I stumbled upon them a little over 5 years ago when I was looking for a unique space to have our wedding reception.  I was treated with top notch service from the very first time I stepped into their location.  Cory, Jason & Travis made our wedding reception way better than we could have ever imagined.  Our guests still talk about it to this day.  We have been loyal patrons ever since & will continue until we are unable. I'm just sorry it took me 5 years to actually write this review, sorry Cory!

My bridal shower cake was ordered from here several years ago (yep, I've been slacking on writing a review).  My friends that hosted I had met while doing the breast cancer 3-day so they had the cake made into a cute bustier, frosted in pink & had a little breast cancer ribbon on it, it was just beautiful.  It tasted amazing too, of course I can't even remember the flavor.  The only thing I have to complain about was the $145 price tag for my cake!  Yikes!

Let me start by saying that the address listed above is not the actual address, the little bakery is just around the corner on 30th St & Thomas, I think it may actually be attached to the back of the address listed here. So, now for my review...my husband & I decided to try a wheat free diet & as you can imagine there is a lot of "crap" out there that is just nasty.  Gluten Free Creations Bakery is a gem I am thrilled to have found, and bonus, it is just a couple miles from my house!   When I pulled up & took my baby out of my car the young man working there came & opened the door for me, huge points there!  He then asked if I had been in before & I told him no, he proceeded to give me a menu of everything they have to offer & let me tell you, it is extensive.  He also showed me where everything was & offered suggestions.  I purchased the simple pizza crust & the Italian pizza crust as well as the Awelicious bread, we have tried the simple pizza crust & the bread and let me tell you, we are impressed with the quality & flavor.  I'll be heading back there again very soon to get more bread & maybe try some other things.

Yum!!!!!  This was my first time trying Indian food & I am now hooked!  We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday & the place was packed & we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait, we decided to stay and we got lucky & were seated in about 10 minutes.  We were so happy that we waited.  The food was absolutely delicious, so much flavor.  The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because once we ordered, we never saw our waitress again & we had to ask the bus boy for more water & he even took our dessert order.

What a wonderful place!  The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.  We dined here with some friends because of a recommendation of an out of town friend who just stumbled upon it while he was in town on business.  The service was top notch and again I cannot say enough positive things about the delicious food.  We will definitely be returning.

I took my husband here for his birthday & every single thing we had from our drinks to dessert & everything in-between and including the service by the staff was phenominal (never in any experience of dining out can I say this, until now).  We decided to share the wedge salad & I'm glad we did because it was definitely big enough to share between two people.  It was perfect, the lettuce was chilled just right, and that dressing, wow, just wow!  Now, I am from the Midwest & my grandfather was a cattle rancher, so I know good beef & I hold very very high standards when it comes to steak.  Our steaks were absolutely amazing, melt in your mouth tender, cooked to the exact right temp that each of us ordered & seasoned just perfect.  For our sides we ordered the Chophouse Corn & the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes...oh my gosh, I cannot even put into words how good these sides were, so I'm not even going to try, you just need to trust me.  We also got a little bonus from the manager of Sautéed Mushrooms & Jumbo Asparagus...now, I am not a fan of either of these, however, the asparagus looked so good that I broke down and tried it, oh my Lord, it was beyond delicious (I ate pretty much most of the plate of these bright green stalks of heavenly goodness), Ocean Prime has ruined me for all other places serving asparagus because I'm sure nothing will even come close.  I didn't try the mushrooms, but my husband pretty much ate the entire bowl, and he is still raving about them weeks later!  To cap off our evening, we had the Creme Brûlée, it is by far our all time favorite dessert, so again we hold very high standards...I swear I heard Angels singing when I took my first bite!  Smooth, creamy, and it had the most perfect sugar topping that I got to crack with my spoon.   I still dream about this dinner, it is one we will never forget.

We have been taking our pets to see Dr. Moffet & Dr. Danner for many years.  They have always taken such good care of all of them.  When our kitty got sick & we had to make the heart wrenching decision to put him to sleep, Dr. Moffet was there to comfort us & let us know we were doing what was best for him. When I was pregnant I had to take my dog in for some tests & I was very ill from "all day" sickness & had to race out of the room to the restroom, when I returned, Dr. Danner had almonds & a cup of water for me!  We have since moved to central Phoenix, but we still make the drive to Mesa because we feel that Dr. Moffet & Dr. Danner are the best vets to take care of our fur babies.

I met a couple friends for drinks and appetizers and WOW, the food was amazing!  Very friendly staff, love the managers!  Atmosphere was perfect.  You must try the Greek Olive Lahvosh...the half order is huge!  Three of us shared it.  The Firecracker Shrimp is also a must try...I expected it to be spicy, but it was not and the flavors...well, it's just too good for words. Can't wait to visit again!

Love, love, love this Phoenix gem!  I stumbled upon it when I was out house hunting & my husband learned about it from a co-worker, so we tried it one night & have been hooked ever since!  The salsa bar is awesome & the food is fantastic!  We are so happy to live just a few short miles from here & we go often!

I have been going to Dr. Hansen since 2006 & I will continue to see him for all my foot and ankle needs (I even drive all the way from Central Phoenix now to see him).  He is simply amazing!  He listens, he talks WITH you about options instead of talking AT you.  He's compassionate & comforts you if you have a little panic attack or a breakdown like yours truly!  I honestly cannot say enough about him.

I've loved Pork On A Fork since the first day I met them at a farmers market.  Their pulled pork & brisket are by far THE BEST anywhere around, and I should know since I am from the midwest where we definitely know BBQ!  I've even got my mother in law hooked & she makes sure to stop by when she is out by their location to get us all some delicious food!

We have been taking our infant son here since he was 11 weeks old.  The staff is so welcoming and very nice.  Our instructor, Andrew, is great.  He makes sure to interact with each of the babies AND the parents in his class & I really like that about him. We are looking forward to a long relationship with Hubbard in Mesa.

If you are looking for an amazing photographer at a very reasonable price then look no further...I can highly recommend Lucky Shot Photography. Meg is such a doll, and is a pleasure to work with.  I had a great time during our mini photo session for my company (it was a last minute deal and of course everything was needed with an express turnaround time, and Meg delivered).  I can't wait to book another session to see what she comes up with next.

I love this store!  They are a little on the high side of the pricing scale, but the quality of items is worth it if you decide to purchase it. I go there to purchase my "go to" baby shower gift...the Meeno Babies car seat liner.  I was also able to get my son's high chair and Uppa Baby umbrella stroller there at a discount during their 4th of July sale.  Everyone has always been very nice to me when I am in there and they always make a point of saying hi to my baby boy too.

My husband surprised me with dinner here for Mother's Day , which was funny since we had just driven by it earlier in the day & I said I had really been wanting to try it, and of course he kept a straight face & didn't say a word to ruin the surprise.  Let me start out with the service...it was impeccable to say the least.  Our server consistently checked on us, answered all of my questions about their gluten free options & was super sweet to our 1 year old, talking directly to him, which he loved & caused him to flirt with her.  The manager (or maybe he was the owner, I'm not sure) also checked on us several times, which I truly appreciate in a restaurant. Now for the food...it was DELICIOUS!  We started out with the Chef's Plate which had meats, cheeses, olives, peppers & more.  Next up was the main course, we both ended up ordering the same thing (happens more often than not),  we got the filet & it was cooked to perfection, I decided to get the fingerling potatoes & broccoli & my husband went with the gluten free pasta option.  My mother in law ordered the salmon.  Last up was the dessert, my hubby ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake & I got the fresh berries & cream.  Everything was incredibly good & we will definitely be going back & will for sure tell our friends.

I love, love, love Humble Pie!  The staff is excellent and super friendly, and the food is quite yummy!  My commercial kitchen for my own business is next door so I go there quite often for lunch.  My favorites are the Caprese (both the salad and the sandwich), those AMAZING seasoned french fries, and let's not forget about the fantastic wood fired pizzas!  They have a great lunch special and a fun Date Night on Thursdays.   If you want good food and a great experience, then you must try Humble Pie!

What's not to love about Wy-Know Cafe?  Jackie, the owner, makes delicious food!  Her herb roasted turkey sandwich is divine and let's not forget about those yummy salads! This is a great place to gather with friends for a fantastic meal and service!

We have been wanting to try Bink's ever since we moved about 3 blocks from it, so I thought my husband's birthday would be the perfect time.  When we walked in we noticed that is was a lot bigger than we expected, it was bright & clean, and we were greeted right away.  The food was very good, the service was a tiny bit slow, but nothing to complain about.  The reason I am only giving 4 stars is because they knew it was my husband's birthday as I had put that in the notes when I made the reservation on Open Table and mentioned it again when we were ordering.  Nothing was said and nothing special was even offered.

Since finding out a year ago that I was gluten intolerant, I have looked far and wide for good gluten free options at restaurants, and while most are good, they just aren't the same as their gluten laden counterparts...UNTIL now!  Jewels Bakery and Cafe is awesome!  I haven't had one thing there that was bad & that's huge considering that a majority of foods that are gluten free taste "off" or taste grainy or like cardboard to me.   They are a little on the pricey side, but I will gladly pay for good food that is gluten free!

How this place has 4 overall stars is beyond me.  I took my son here a few weeks ago & I'm still ticked off about our experience.  First off, let me start with the only positive thing I have for this restaurant...it has a very cool modern look and feel, which I like. Now for the rest of our experience...the music is so loud you can barely hear anything else, so I opted to sit outside.  The patio is quite large, but has absolutely no shading from the sun, it's Arizona, the sun is out 95% of the year!  I had to move my son 3 times to try & keep the sun out of his eyes.  Next, it took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over & greet us, and take a drink order.  When the waiter finally came by, I could barely hear him or understand him because he was talking so soft, I swear he was on something by the way he was acting.  I asked if we could go ahead and place our food order since my son was getting really hungry & restless.  I ordered buttered noodles for my son and bacon and eggs for me, it took 40 minutes to get our food!!!  The place was not even that busy.  I will say that the eggs were really good, but when I picked up the bacon, the grease dripped off in a huge puddle, like it was not even drained off, yikes!  Now for my son's food, he will eat just about anything you put in front of him, but as soon as he put the noodles in his mouth he spit them right back out, I have no idea what they did to them, but he just wouldn't eat them.  I told the waiter when he finally walked by again that he just couldn't eat them & asked if I could I order something different & he said that was fine & he said he would take it off the check.  I asked him to see if they could rush it & 25 minutes later, still no food for my son, I called the waiter over & he said the kitchen was really busy & couldn't give him a timeframe as to when the food would be out (again, not a ton of people in there at this time), so I said to just cancel the new order & asked if I could have the check.  He brought the check & it still had the buttered noodles on it, so I called him over again and reminded him that he said he would take it off, he then proceeded to argue with me about taking it off the check, I asked to speak to a manager & he told me that no managers are employed there...what?!?!?!  He finally got snarky and said he would take it off. Not a good experience at all for us or for the other 4 tables around me from what I observed.
