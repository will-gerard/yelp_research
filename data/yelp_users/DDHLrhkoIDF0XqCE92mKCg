I had Arizona Cold Air install a new AC seven years ago. On Monday night, the AC went out. I called at 7:00 AM on Tuesday morning and they had a tech out by 10;00 AM that morning. He had the unit repaired within 1/2 hour! That's amazing service for Arizona in the summer time!  Best part of it was they honored their 10 year warranty without me even bringing it up!

I brought my car in for an oil change about a month ago and waited for the completion, estimated at 1 hour. They said they found evidence that my water pump had been leaking. The reserve reservoir was done about and inch, and they used a black light to show me some bits of spray.  I didn't have time to get estimated $600-$800  repair done so left when oil change was done. When I got home, I refilled the reservoir to the recommended coolant level and have monitored it for the last month. It hasn't dropped a bit and there has been no more "spray". The car has been well maintained and only 70,000 miles or so. The whole thing has spoiled me on their shop. Good luck if you use them.

Always looking for good Thai food, and this place hits all the high notes! Friendly staff, fantastic food presentation, clean, nice simple atmosphere and reasonably priced. They're also set up well to handle large parties. There was a group of 15 right by us, and another birthday group arriving as we left.
