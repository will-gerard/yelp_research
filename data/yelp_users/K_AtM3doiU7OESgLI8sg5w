Meh. Friday night at 7:00. They were busy. That makes sense. Would've made more sense to have more experienced staff working they night.   I was brought the wrong drink, my Del Rio combo was over salted to a near inedible degree.   I'll give two stars because my girl liked her tacos and my server tried hard, and what could I possibly expect from a giant chain restaurant.

Went on a Saturday night. Made reservations for 9. Got there at 8:45. Got seated at 9:15 with no acknowledgment of our wait. The wait staff seemed frazzled. They allowed us to order and then told us all of the dishes they were out of. Two of the five things they were out of were my wife's top two choices.  Would've been nice to know when they gave us the menus.   I went with a steak, which was fine, but awkward as she had to settle for chicken tenders. The grilled artichoke was on point, though. I ordered a beer. It never showed up. My wife asked for a cocktail menu. They said they didn't have one but they could make whatever.   Our waitress seemed disinterested and barely checked on us. The food server said nothing to us and gave us an icy stare. We spent $75 to have a celebration meal that we very much regretted. Next time I'll remember to spend the extra dough on Ruth's Chris or save $10 and go to Charleston's. I've never had a bad experience at either one.   Don't get me wrong, the food that they did have in stock was decent, but it wasn't worth the price once you factor in the apathetic service and the LOUD atmosphere.

I was referred to Tom through a friend to purchase auto and renters insurance.  I saved money over my current provider, which was a huge plus, but that wasn't the most impressive part.  What impressed me most was that Tom took the time to actually explain my coverage options to me and was able to explain them to me in meaningful, yet understandable terms.  Several months later, I referred my fiance to Tom.  She was duly impressed as well, and switched her auto policy to State Farm from a competitor.  Afterwards, the competitor tried to scam her into paying for her old policy that she had cancelled.  We called Tom's office, forwarded them the letter she had received from her former insurance provider, and a member of Tom's staff contacted her former insurer right away and resolved the issue that day.  As long as Tom and his staff are around, I won't need to shop around for insurance again.

Update to prior review.  Tom continues to impress.  The worst case scenario happened.  My fiance was rear ended on the 202 in August and the damage rendered her car a total loss.  Again, the folks at State Farm and Tom's office were on top of the situation.  They got us in touch with the claims adjuster and told us exactly what to expect, from getting a check for the car, to getting her medical bills paid.  She was even compensated for her pain and suffering.  You never want something bad to happen, but when it does, it feels good to have a trusted advisor in your corner.

Best burger in Phoenix. I don't get there often, but when I'm near the Biltmore area, I always make it a point to stop in. Order the DLuxe burger. Why mess around? It's perfect. Just get it as-is, medium rare. Then get yourself a shopping cart of sweet potato fries and dip them in the fry sauce. Do it! You won't regret it.   What else? The beer selection is amazing. And the service...the service. I can't even describe how friendly and accommodating they were today at lunch. I put my white cloth napkin across my black pants and the waitress asked if I would prefer a black napkin instead so I could match. What? That's insane attention to detail.   I've been going for 10 years. I took my wife-to-be there on one of our first dates. I take clients there. I had my bachelor party meet there for dinner before we hit the nudie bar. It's versatile like that. I'll always come back.

I love thin crust pizza.  I love eat even more when they don't skimp on the cheese, and this place does not!  Wonderful staff, great prices, and I saw a free comedy show and the comedians were top quality pro comics.  Definitely worth checking out.

Great dive bar. Beer was ice cold and happy hour prices during the Sunday comedy show were super cheap. The staff and fellow patrons were all friendly and welcoming. It has a very blue collar feel, which I like. Nothing fancy here, hot wings, cold beer and funny jokes. I'll be back.

Shane's mobile picked my car up from my office, left me loaner car in case of emergency, fixed my car quickly, accurately and for a very fair price.  Then they brought my car back to me in time for me to leave for the day.  They were very transparent about what needed fixed (my car had a high pitch squealing noise when I started it and my A/C wasn't as cold as it should be), how much it would cost and how soon it could be done.  They even told me about other issues they found, told me how much they would cost, and told me the priority level of each one.  They didn't pressure me to fix any of the other problems that day.  And unlike other auto repair shops, they most expensive repair was not the most important to fix.  Imagine that...an honest auto repair shop!  I have already referred two friends there and they were both thrilled with the service they received.  I am definitely taking my car back to Shane's for any and all repairs

My fiance was selling her rental property, and a few days before closing, we were informed that the the property didn't pass the termite inspection.  We called Allan at Green Ninja on a Saturday and explained our situation and the time sensitive nature of the deal.  He went to the house the very next day, on a Sunday, and treated the property for termites and gave the official termite inspection to the realtor (I guess you have to be licensed for that type of thing for the inspections to be approved by FHA).  Anyway, whatever he did satisfied the loan requirements for the folks buying the house, and the deal got done on time.    So thank you Green Ninja for helping to save the sale of the house, working with a difficult realtor, and working on a Sunday, in the rain, on short notice.

This review is for lunch. I know it looks like a hip place for happy hour, so maybe that's their niche, because lunch isn't it.   I had the lunch platter. It was $12 for a bowl of miso dumpling soup, which I enjoyed, and a basic roll and four pieces of assorted nigiri. It just wasn't a good value. $12 for that much sushi would be cool if it was better than pre-packaged grocery store rolls, but it wasn't. It was incredibly ordinary.

Try the sweet potato muffin (warmed up).  Quiet, calm atmosphere. Friendly staff. Locally owned.

Portions were very small. The food I got (butter chicken) wasn't bad, but a little too salty. But $7 for the tiniest portion ever. A restaurant can make up for price by adding value (friendly service, great ambience), but Wok Box fails on those fronts as well. Next time I'm at that mall and hungry, I'll walk next door to Chipotle and get a better value for my $7.
