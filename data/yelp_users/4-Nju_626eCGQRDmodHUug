Get in here and donate your blood!  It takes less than an hour, andyou get great snacks too!  The people are very friendly, the place is spotlessly clean, and it doesn't even hurt!

Great service by Allison; TERRIBLE food!  Took over 40 min to get awful, cold food.  Spoke to mgr, who never came to table, and only offered dessert as compensation.  "Banana muffin" was vanilla cream cupcake?

Kelly has been doing my hair for some time now.  I love her, and HIGHLY recommend her.  She really knows color and styling.  She asks what works for your lifestyle and time, and knows how to work w/ all types of hair.  She's 5 stars in my book
