I have gotten mani pedis here before and they do a good job but I got acrylic for a wedding and although it looked nice when I left, they soon started to fall apart. After paying 25 plus tip I was hoping they would last longer.. They just were not made with love. I won't be getting acrylic here any longer.

I have been coming here for months to bring my son since he got his first haircut he's now 2. I am always pleased. The barber always hears you out on what style your looking for. Customer service here is great and they have affordable prices. Definitely recommend!

Great place for braces! Only $2950 they accept payment plans of course. Great dentist. Yes area is not the nicest and not a luxury office but you get everything you want from a dentist here without breaking the bank. Highly recommend. Great staff too. This is a bilingual office which is a plus for Spanish speaking patients.

Although the people who helped us were friendly prices were not competitive as they claim to be. Wouldn't give us free delivery after a 1500 deal so we walked out we don't have time to be picking up and assembling ourself. We actually had a much better experience at living spaces. Don't waste your time here head over to living spaces modern beautiful future at a good price and only 99 bucks for delivery and assembly. Worth it considering low prices they give you on furniture.

Pretty much worse experience I've had with McDonald's. The girl at cashier that initially took my order was nice but other than that this place gets a huge thumbs down. Play area was ridiculously hot seems like AC wasn't working. Food took longer than usual to be ready than I'm used to at a fast food chain. My sons kids meal was missing his juice and yogurt so I had to get up twice to ask for it. And customer service was not very good. I appreciate when they at least attempt to care be quick and friendly. Will not be returning.

Best mexican style hot dogs in the valley in my opinion and that's coming from a mexican. They are also very kind and attentive because customer service matters. They are bacon wrapped served on a warm soft bun with beans and you add all the extra yummy stuff like cheese salsa guacamole. Area a little scary but that's cool because I usually get to go anyway! Well that's my review now go buy a hot dog and enjoy!

I was taken quickly, the work was done fast and beautifully. I always appreciate when they don't hurt me because it happens sometimes. Only was supposed to do one glittered nail on the ring finger but they didn't have a silver glitter or even purple glitter color. I would recommend anyone to go. Professional service and nice location.

Based on coffee alone this place is not your typical Starbucks I ordered the new graham latte and my husband ordered the cinnamon dolce latte and both did not taste the way they usually do not even close!

Great chicken fingers! Love the sauce, bread, and fries. The lemonade is really good too. I think this place is way better than chick fil a! Plus it's open late if you get those late night cravings!

Great customer service! Clean, friendly and fast. Tacos are amazing I recommend the short rib. Burgers are good too. Yummy horchata and lemonades. You have to try dulce de leche shake will blow your mind !

The only thing I like at this place is the atmosphere and location. The food had no flavor and was mediocre. Our server didn't make us feel welcome or answer our questions with interest or recommend anything on the menu and we pointed it was our first time. I won't be coming back. Terrible experience. Cannot understand everyone else's good reviews. Don't waste your time people go to nook instead or pizza heaven. Point is way better places to dine around the area.

Authentic Mexican food. Great tacos. Coming from a Mexican family I can be tough critic on Mexican food it's hard to find a taco place that sparks my interest. This would be one of them. Great service as well. Highly recommend:)

It's like a chipotle but with pizza ! Love the concept, pizza is tasty not going to lie and say it's the best I've had but it's still very yummy. Area is comfortable and clean, their staff is beyond helpful! If you don't like the way it turns out maybe too crispy they offer to remake it for no charge. I actually forgot my debit card once I only had 9 bucks cash my total was 18! So embarrassing but the girl was soooo nice and insisted to not worry about it she took care of it for me. I just thought it was so generous of her and I plan to leave her a good tip next time! Also they have beer and wine what else do you need to go with pizza ? Highly recommend !
