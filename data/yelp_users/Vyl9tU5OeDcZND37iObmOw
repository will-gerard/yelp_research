My friend and I split a Steak & Tendon small pho and a banh xeo. We were both very satisfied and full after this meal. This is the best banh xeo that I've had in Arizona so far. If you've never had a banh xeo before, it's like a Vietnamese style crepe/omelette. The outer part is egg, and inside contains: bean sprouts, meat (pork, I believe), and shrimp. You cut a piece of it, and then wrap it around the large lettuce leaves. Then you dip the lettuce wrapped crepe into the fish sauce, and enjoy.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE BANH XEO! If you've never heard of it, or tried it before, I highly recommend it. Share with a friend if you're scared to try new things. If you're adventurous, try it on its own, I think it's very filling and can serve as a meal.   The pho is ordinary, but other members of my party were jipped on some meats that were supposed to be included in their soup. Small size is definitely enough, even if the waiter thinks it's a "children size." Service was okay, but I'd definitely come again, just for the banh xeo. :)

Thai restaurant? Y'all already know what your girl, Angela ordered. (Pad Thai, of course!) For it being on the Lunch Special menu, it was pretty pricey. $9.99 for a decent portion + choice of soup or salad. I chose and loved the soup, it had a strong ginger taste, and I love me some ginger!  Given it's Scottsdale, where I assume food is a little bit pricier, I won't dwell on the $9.99. But I can honestly say, that the Pad Thai (with shrimp and chicken) was super dry. You could see the clumpy paste of a sauce they put on the dish, and the chicken, yikes! Very, Very dry.  The flavoring was fine, but just toooooooooo dry! I wanted to pour water over the noodles! Towards the end, I was dipping my chicken into my friend's curry as an attempt to soften up the chicken, but it didn't work :(

Wow, this is my 3rd time trying to post a review, and each time it has been erased when I go to press submit....  I came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and was VERY disappointed. The food was awful. I am not vegetarian nor vegan so I am not knowledgeable in appreciating good mock meat, but I CAN differentiate between tasty and unappetizing.  Artichoke Dip was watery and looked like light grey/brown colored gunk.  I got the Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl with tofu and was only able to take a couple bites because it really tasted awful. I typically really like eating tofu too. Please believe me in that I am not a picky eater and it is very rare for me to dislike a restaurant meal.  My boyfriend got a mock beef dish that had this underlying soy flavor. One plus about both our entrees was the amount of veggies in our dishes, but we couldn't even pick out the vegetables because of that strong background taste that lingered on our tongues.

Gyros Sandwich under $4, that's my kind of a meal. I think it was a beef and lamb combo with lettuce and yummy tzatziki sauce, wrapped in scrumptious pita bread. I also ordered the hummus, which was $2.50 - not worth it in my opinion. I think the flavored hummus at grocery stores taste better and it'll be less expensive too. Haji-Baba is definitely a hole in the wall, with little fruit flies and flies buzzing around, but the taste is great, and the price is fair.  Note: If you want to eat at the restaurant, just have a seat at any table on the right hand side and a waiter will come with menus and take your order. If you want to take it to go, then go straight to the register and they'll take care of you.  After you finish eating at the restaurant, bring that little receipt stub left at your table to the cash register, and they'll ring you up. :)

Mexican and Chinese Fusion? Strange, but awesomely delicious! I wouldn't consider this joint a "cheap eats" though. It's about $8.50 a plate.  I ordered 7Q + 10 with JFR Translation: Jade Red Chicken in a Quesadilla + Emerald Chicken with Jerk Fried Rice.  Super delicious! I especially enjoyed the quesadilla. The emerald chicken is a mock off a traditional Chinese dish (Tzong Yoh Jee: Green Onion and Oil Chicken). I've definitely had better chicken, but for an American joint, I give it 4 stars for trying. The jerk fried rice is a must try, I absolutely loved it! It has a spicy punch that really hits the spot (the perfect amount of spiciness!)  I didn't sample their items because I was in a rush, but I think it is super awesome that the staff are super friendly and offer samples to their patrons.  I will definitely come again! :)

I purchased the HomeRun deal - $1 for admission AND a free cup of draft beer. DEFINITELY worth it! However, I doubt I'll come back on a night they charge cover (which is basically everyday, I believe).   It was my first time at a piano bar, and was pleasantly surprised at how fun the night was. My friends tell me that piano bars in San Diego play contemporary and top 40 songs, so I was expecting to jam to piano renditions to the latest tunes. Although I didn't know several songs the piano duos played, I still found the live entertainment fun and lively.  If you find a table, the waitresses are very attentive and come by often to check if you're thirsty. I don't know if they do this every night, but they have a contest for a free party at the Big Bang for 100 of your friends if you could name the "corniest song of the 80s" -- this was our topic of the night. People would write the name of a song down on a napkin, put down cash, and the pianists would play it and wait for other patrons to outbid you.

This was the first Thai restaurant I tried in Mesa. It was delish. I love their Thai iced tea, and of course, their Pad Thai with fried tofu. Their dinner portion is not as big as Tum Nak Thai, but nonetheless, very satisfying.  Thai House is also pretty generous in their tofu portions and the Pad Thai is less oily but the flavor is still great. I think it's also free to have a mix of chicken and tofu - but I've never tried to do that here.

I've been looking for a good authentic Chinese restaurant in Arizona, and this one was pretty good! If you guys have other suggestions, please send them my way!  Note #1: The menu is very confusing, it's not organized very well. If you have a Mandarin or Cantonese speaking friend or family member, I'd suggest bringing them so they can order their favorite dishes.   Note #2: This is a Hong Kong style restaurant. So order Cantonese style dishes.  Here's what we got for $24 including tax and tip: Garlic or Schezuan Eggplant Seafood Pan Fried Noodles Mongolian Beef  The eggplant was good, but way too much chili oil was added. There was a puddle of oil on the bottom of the dish.  The seafood crispy noodles - eh, I've definitely had better, and I was disappointed that it wasn't outstanding because this is a signature Cantonese dish. Maybe the Beef Chow Fun would've been a better choice (another signature Cantonese dish).  The Mongolian beef - American dish, so it tasted pretty American, but nonetheless, it was tasty :)  Rice is complimentary I believe, and the waitresses were VERY attentive, they kept topping off our waters.

For Korean food in Arizona, I was pleased with Chodang :)  We had a large party, and the service wasn't so great. They forgot one of my friend's orders and only came by once to refill water, and never came by to offer us more small dishes: Dried Seaweed (Kim), Pickled seaweed, Apple/potato salad mix, kimchi (napa cabbage wasn't ripe though), another type of kimchi, and bean sprouts. Pretty good array of small dishes.  My friend and I shared a Kimchi beef tofu soup ($9.75). and then 6 of us shared the Seafood Pancake ($16.95). The tofu soup was great, but the seafood pancake, I definitely don't think it's worth the price. A couple pieces were burnt, and it just wasn't that amazing + super pricey.  I would definitely come back for the tofu soup though!

Same menu, service is fine, most often very attentive - but you have to ask for bread and butter, the servers don't just give it to you.  Here are my favorites:  Spinach & Artichoke Dip appetizer Thai Crunch salad BBQ Chicken Pizza Pear Gorgonzola Pizza Garlic Chicken Pizza $16.95 Jambalaya Pasta ** MOST FAVORITE DISH here (although pricey) $6.95 - Mushroom Flatbread (on their Lunch Menu - delicious and well worth the price! b/c it comes with a BIG side salad too) Clam Linguini   The past few times I've been here was for the Yellow Ticket Promotion where the managers reveal a prize (ranging from 10%, 20% or 50% off meal, free frozen pizzas for a year, and cash prizes). One of my friends got the 50% off coupon so I ordered a few things I've never tried, one being the   Japanese Eggplant Pizza on whole wheat dough (eh, it wasn't that great, and I'm glad I got it for 50% off)  CPK food is overpriced, but if you haven't tried the jambalaya pasta, please do next time you go, because it's really great :)

This is a really chic place. Cool lighting and I like the ambiance a lot! I came here with a party of 7 on a Friday night and the wait was supposed to be 45 minutes. However, within 10 minutes, the hostess came out and offered the sofa/lounge area that fit us pretty well. It was hard to situate our food though, on the 2 small tables, especially since most of us were splitting dishes.  Here's what we ordered: Mojito - small glass, pretty refreshing with cucumber and on the strong side Prickly Pear Margarita - large glass, doesn't taste like a typical margarita fyi Long Island - strong! but gets the job done :)  Goat Cheese + Pear Salad - Yum! I'd ask for the vinaigrette dressing on the side, because the last few bites are very acidic.   Sicily Pizza with added mushrooms - about 10 inch size -- definitely enough for 1 hungry person and pretty yummy, but there wasn't much sauce. I highly recommend adding mushrooms because there wasn't that many toppings.  Other members of my party shared a calzone - those are massive! I definitely want to try one next time :)

I've had Pad Thai with Chicken and Tofu here at lunch and dinner. The lunch portion is smaller but it comes with a fried egg roll. I only get mild but I hear that medium spiciness is pretty spicy.  The dinner portion to go is amazing. I tend to eat a lot, and my friend and I were able to share a dinner portion and were completely full afterward.  I love Tum Nak Thai because they don't charge extra for splitting up the meat. I love fried tofu, but sometimes I just want a little meat, so I always ask for a mix here.   The flavor is good, but the dish is pretty oily.

3+ meals for $10.75? GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)  How do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.  I recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!  Advice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.  Ask the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!

Extremely nice and courteous servers and hostesses, and awesome food, The Parlor is a true gem :)  3 of us ordered a 14" Yukon Gold Potato Pizza which had large pieces of potatoes, pancetta, and gorgonzola cheese. It was super oily, and I kinda wish there were napkins to pat down some of the oil. Nonetheless, it was very tasty, and I'm glad we shared, because I probably would have got sick of eating it after a while. We also got the Duck Club Sandwich - which was amazing. Tender duck is hard to make, and this place does it well. The bbq sauce and crispy bacon was just delightful for the sandwich. The fries on the side were well seasoned, and perfectly crisp.  The only bad part of the night were all the Mavericks fans at the restaurant that were cheering after the Lakers lost :(

I'd hate to be the first to give Maria's 4 stars, because it is a small local business and the lady who takes our orders has always been sweet. The restaurant is definitely on the small side and pretty bare - just a few booths and tables and the Mexican channel is always on in the corner, but nonetheless, pretty good food for the price you pay. I came here for lunch today and ordered:   California Burrito - $4.84 (including tax) - great deal, it's a huge burrito and pretty yummy in my book!  I also had the street tacos before on a previous visit, but they're definitely not taco truck quality like I was expecting.   The hot sauce is pretty good, not too spicy, but just adds that little extra flavor that really makes the burrito delicious.

I grew up in LA and went to school in the Bay Area, so it's hard to compete in the nightlife realm. But, I am being fair and rating Tonic amongst the bars & clubs I've hit up since I've moved to Arizona. Bought the LivingSocial deal for Tonic, and went here with my boyfriend to order $30 worth of food. We ended up spending $50 and the bartender didn't know how to accept our coupon, so that totally sucked.  here's what we got for $50: 2 medium sized pizza - super oily, but decent pizza 3 sliders - typical Spinach & Artichoke Dip with pizza bread pieces - yummy!! 2 pints of Great Shark 1 bottle of Apple Cider   There's free popcorn, a pool table, and I like that there's flat screens everywhere playing old school hip hop mixed in with some current R&B. I suggest coming during happy hour, because all that food I listed are around half off in price, and the drinks are too! I think they have happy hour from 4-8 everyday, so next time the boyfriend comes to town, we're planning to visit Tonic again and hopefully, THIS time our LivingSocial coupon will work.  Note: There is no dancing at Tonic, I thought lounge = some dancing, but there isn't any dancing here. Good place to grab drinks though!

I came here with friends after a long day of shopping. It's on the Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining list, so we decided to give it a shot.  Parking in Scottsdale has always been a hassle, but we were lucky to get a parking spot close to the restaurant after circling around a few times.   There was only one waiter at the restaurant, and he was WONDERFUL. The three of us all ordered Pad Thai. It came with 5 or 6 pieces of big succulent shrimp, and TONS of chicken. The portion was very large, but since I was starving I finished the whole thing. My friends like their Pad Thai on the spicy side and they were pleased that the waiter gave them a scale of 1-5 with Tabasco as a reference point of  3. It allowed them to get a good idea of how spicy their food would be.  We asked for extra peanuts, and the waiter came by with a side dish full of freshly chopped roasted peanuts. We also asked for extra lime, and he cut up 2-3 limes for us. He topped off our waters without us asking. All of this great service amongst several patrons, including one individual at a nearby table who was extremely demanding and indecisive. Major props to the waiter and excellent/generous chef.

I came here on my friend's recommendation. I'm not a big curry fan, but  perhaps the curry is amazing like she said.   First off, when we walked in, the owner and waiter were talking to each other. My boyfriend and I weren't sure if we should wait to be seated or just walk to any table. After standing for a few minutes, the waiter told us to have a seat anywhere without leaving behind the counter. We sat down, and the two continued their conversation. I had to look back 4 - 5 times before the waiter came and brought us menus. When we decided what to order, he didn't come back until I looked back another 4 - 5 times. By the way, there was only one other table occupied that was deciding what they wanted for dessert. I can't say anything bad about the waiter because he was overall nice, but not attentive at all. We never got water refills.  I always order Pad Thai, and wasn't wowed by it here. First, they charge for adding tofu. I got a chicken and tofu mix - and although I paid for tofu, there wasn't much tofu added. I always get mild flavored Pad Thai, and I feel that really allows you to taste the food. If there's still a lot of flavor without the spiciness, then you know the natural dish is well made and not masked by the spices. The portion was alright - but not enough peanuts nor bean sprouts. The dish itself was way too sweet for my taste.  My boyfriend ordered the sizzling beef dish. I was able to finish my entire dish before his entree came out. The waiter didn't tell us that it was going to take that long. It came on a clay dish and sizzled a lot, but for the price, it wasn't worth it at all. The beef was pretty typical. It tasted kind of like black pepper chicken at Panda Express - but beef instead of chicken. FYI: my Pad Thai came out after a very long time as well.   From walking in to walking out, I think it took us an entire hour for this meal. Don't go here if you're in a rush, and don't order the Pad Thai nor Sizzling Beef Dish.

ATSU students have membership to the YMCA included in our tuition so I'm very grateful for its convenient location right next to campus.   It's never too busy, I can always find an open treadmill or elliptical machine (and I go to the Y almost everyday, at all times of the day - 5 pm, 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm). There's cable TV on every unit, and an Ipod charger. They always keep the temperature just right, not too hot nor cold (where it's hard to move your muscles). Staff is super friendly too!  The classes are great! I've tried Yoga (not the best workout, but if you want a relaxing stretching hour, it's great) and Body Pump (if it's your first body pump class, make sure to use the lightest weights!)  The only downside is that on weekends they have limited open hours (12 - 5 pm).

Tip - You have to utilize their "complimentary valet." There is no way around it, the restaurant is located in an area with NO street parking within walking distance and the plaza across the street is off limits to NoRTH patrons.  Now onto the review: NoRTH is yet another great Fox Concepts restaurant to take a date, with just the right amount of mood lighting. I happen to enjoy looking at my boyfriend ;) so I wouldn't care if the room was bright as day, but you know how some fancy restaurants are just SOO dark that the song "better with the lights off" comes to mind? This is definitely not that, I don't like those restaurants haha.  ANYWAY, the decor is cute, decked out with a modern farmhouse feel and the plaid-shirt suited up service is IMPECCABLE. The food is pretty good too :)  Here's what we ordered:  $11 - Cheese & Bread platter: Melted Italian cheese with tomato jam + toasted Sourdough bread with olive oil -- this was pretty good, especially with the tomato and fruit jam in the middle of the cheese to spread onto the perfectly toasted bread. **NOTE: THIS IS A LARGE & FILLING APPETIZER   $17 - Rock Shrimp Pasta: VERY DELICIOUS! The noodles are playfully shaped and the sauce is a tomato base with a little citrus hint and some chili flakes. That's my personal description of it, but the menu description sounds way better - that's why I ordered it, and when I did, the waitress confirmed that it was her favorite pasta dish on the menu.  $15 - House Special Pizza - Fresh mozzarella, some type of Italian sausage (but it was very thinly cut, almost like prosciutto) and tomato sauce. This was okay in my book. Nonetheless, nice serving size and good taste - definitely enough for one person.

There's been a lot of groupons for SMG lately, $5 for a movie and a soft drink? Now that's a great deal!  Tip: Arrive to your movie at least 30-40 minutes prior to the show. This is so you can have a choice in seating. There are comfy la-z-boy type seats with sliding table tops (large lecture hall style desks) and then there are office chairs placed way too close together over a long table top (diner style counter top). I prefer the comfy la-z-boy's and to use the groupon, you just have to arrive early in order to get in the front of the line.   If you don't want to arrive early, I suggest purchasing tickets online ($11) and then adding $1 to have reserved seating.   Please note - SMG staff starts lining movie patrons up about 15 minutes prior to the show and it's kind of like a mad dash run. Everyone wants to get in line first!   Once you're seated, there are lots of SMG waiters/waitresses awaiting your food orders. Considering this is the movies, and refreshments cost an arm and a leg, I believe the pricing of the food is reasonable. A pizza for $10, A burger + fries for $10 etc. I've only tried the white chocolate macademia cookies with vanilla ice cream = ~$5-6, and I've had cookies that were so soft, fresh, and delicious, but the other time I got cookies that were hard, and a little burnt.  Ps. There's cocktails! - I ought to try one of those next time :)
