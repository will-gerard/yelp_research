I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place.

I have ommitted one star for the fact that you could not always read the plant signage or the Chihuly installation piece signage. Other than that, it was amazing. The live music, the tasty beverages, I opted for the hot apple cider with Jack Daniels. Helped to keep me warm on a chilly desert night. The installation pieces were all integrated seemlessly with the plants and accented them beautifully. For those unfortunate souls who did not get the chance to experience the exhibit at night during Luminarias or who were so rudely rained out, I posted a few of my favs. I took over 50 pictures but mercifully only posted 11 for the Yelpers. Hope you enjoy.

The sandwiches were amazing.  My friend and I ordered the soppressata and the tomato, basil, mozzarella to share.  The sandwiches were so fresh.  The ingredients tasted crispy and complimented very well.  I understand the limited menu is so that they can focus on producing less at greater quality but I am so curious to see what else they could put together.  And I kinda wish there was a little more shade outside in the eating area.  It happened to be a hot day amd my cream soda got warm fast and eating a hot sandwich in the sun isn't so easy.

The Rhythm Room was the first blues bar I visited when I moved here to Arizona. I randomly showed up for their fall music festival.  I saw so many great local acts that I had no idea existed! And It was my first introduction to Big Pete Pearson.  That guy puts on a GREAT show and always interacts with the crowd and will talk to any random bar patron who wants to praise his performance or just talk music. The RR is also really good about showcasing newer bands from all over the country of all genres. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders are awesome and always show ample cleavage. The crowd on any given night ranges from the young hipsters to the AARP crowd who still dress up for a night on the town with cocktails and dancing. There is no pretension here.  I love this place and everytime I go, I wonder why I've been away for so long.

The carne asada torta is great. Terrific flavors, soft bread, tender meat. Actually anything with the carne asada or the carnitas is good. And the ladies in the kitchen and behind the counter are super sweet. It's good place to stop by for lunch or you can phone your order in and they'll usually have it ready within 10 to 15 minutes.

They didn't have the meat for the sandwich I ordered. So I ordered another sandwich, which was cheaper and they didn't refund me the difference. Both my mom's sandwich and mine was dry and the bread stale. Oh yeah, and I found many small bones in my sandwich as well. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WIll NEVER go back.

The atmosphere is faux irish pub. The beers are slightly overpriced. All this could be forgiven if not for the terrible service. The waitresses were rude. Apparently serving customers was not part of their job description. Requests for service were repeatedly ignored and this cannot be blamed on a full crowd because the bar was half full at best.  Choose another spot for a truly friendly irish pub where the beers are cheap and everyone has to sing a song :)

Just found out about this place. Went for a Sunday brunch with a couple friends and a toddler. Good food, a bit limited breakfast selection, their on line menu had more options, but we had been waiting so long to just get our drink order we didn't waste more time asking questions. I had the red flannel hash, and it was a big portion and very tasty. Not greasy spoon style at all, which was nice. The place isn't very kid friendly, even though there were TONS of families there. No kid activities, no kid menus. This place seemed to be a popular breakfast spot so they should really address the common complaint of slow service but staffing more waiters or cooks to remedy the situation. We were seated a little after 11pm and did not receive our food until 5 after 12. Three breakfast plates should NOT take that long to make. So either go on less crowded days and times, or just don't show up hungry. But the generous ratio of champagne to OJ in their mimosas helps makes the time pass. :)

I love this place. I've taken everyone I know and love here. And no complaints from anyone so far. My Anglo friends like the food and so does mi familia.  Most people who are only famliar with Americanized Mexican food will not understand what is going on here. And those haters out there that think Mexican cuisine cannot be a fine dining experience, you can keep your 2 for 1 tacos made from questionable meat sources. If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja, Rocky Point and Cancun, you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors. The Chiles en Nogada and the Pato en Tamarindo are my favs. And with over 200 tequilas to taste, I look forward to tryng something new every visit.

Went here with Amanda B. and loved the food. I had a traditional pasty and Amanda gerously offered me a taste of her Mexican flavor inspired pasty. Both had excellent flavors and the pasty pastry bread was so flakey and buttery. Just like ones I used to grab from the local lunch stops in every town around the UK next to a metro station. And yes, the service is slow, but the price, taste and size of the meal all makes up for it.

Become a member! Get a card to rack up points on the alcohol you buy. If you're a lush like myself and my friends then it'll pay off in no time.  I just took advandtage of their 5 cent sale. Buy one bottle of wine get the second for 5 cents. If you shop online they have other liquors as well and you can pick them up at the store. And if the store doesn't have it, they can order it for you. Everything you could ever want or need or didn't know existed related to drinking is in this store.

Had the $9.95 meal deal. Picked a main dish and two sides. Generous portions of everything was given. I had the Pork, grilled zucchini and potatoes. Everything was seasoned well, the prok was juicy and flavorful. It was enough for two whole meals. The sandwiches looked good and the pastries looked devine. Am determined to make it back there soon. Great place for lunch, and near a great historic neighborhood to go walking around when finished to make up for all the tasty goodness in your belly.

I liked it. We sat outside on the patio for lunch and had a great people watching experience. I ordered the special flatbread for the day, sausage, carmelized onions and cheese. My friend ordered the buffalo sloppy joe. Both meals were amazing we also ordered a side of fries to split.  Good portions and very flavorful food all around. The only thing we would have changed was that the sloppy joe came with tator tots. And looking at the menu, they list sweet potato tots as a side. So naturally we assumed they tots would be the same but they weren't. They were just regular old tots, nothing special.  Would definitely go back for lunch again. Also, the hotel decor, bar, lobby and lounge were stylish and seemed to have the potential for a good downtown hotspot if marketed correctly.

I just went to the bar to meet some friends for happy hour after work and we could've stayed all night. The bartender was awesome! Very attentive, made a great mojito and funny as hell! The happy hour special were decent, nothing amazing but the people watching was good. Mostly conventioneers swirling in and out for a cocktail before dinner. The ambience was nostalgic and warm and there was a an old war movie playing on a projector screen in the lounge to the side of the bar. I like this hotel bar for starting a night out if you're in downtown and are not in the mood for all the celebrity owned sports bars.

So happy to have a local bar in the neighborhood. It's definitely not the Emerald, but who knows, they may have some local punk acts play a set one night.  The staff were wonderful, the owner very gracious. The alcohol selection was decent but a few of my fellow patrons were surprised by the $3 PBR's, but most other prices were reasonable for the area. The decor is definitely ikea hip lounge, recognized many things from the catalogue. Since this will be the new stumble home bar for the area, we were a little wary of the stairs but I'm sure we'll work it out. Since it was the first week open, the happy hour specials hadn't been decided, but we're looking forward to finding out. The music selection was awesome, a bit loud if you wanted a quiet conversation.

It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house. It taunts me daily. Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime. The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price.  Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave.
