We just moved to the area and we were craving Chinese. I am so happy we tried China Village. The inside is nice and clean, the owner came out to talk to us and he was super friendly and funny. I got the BBQ Pork with Bean Curd and my husband got the Hunan Chicken. Both came out very fast and done wonderfully. Tea was complimentary which is always nice and was not over brewed like a lot of places. There are a lot of Chinese Food choices in this area but I highly recommend China Village!!!!!!!!!!

What do you mean you have never been here? This place is AWESOME!!!!! My family brings everyone here and never a complaint. Their cheese steaks are awesome, cheese curds amazing, chimichangas are out of this world!!!!! Staff is always nice and attentive. Hint: try their soups. Really! They are made from scratch and just fantastic! My favs are the clam chowder and the cream of mushroom!!!!!

Went because of Valentine's Day. Won't go again. The food was ok enough but the staff was horrible. She forgot to place an order for us three different times and we kept having to ask someone else for help. Then to find out after an hour and a half of trying to get our food correct that if we wanted an extra soda there were no refills, you had to pay again. Food was ok, but not worth everything else involved.

I have tried a lot of Pho in the Valley and I have to say hands Dow this is THE BEST PHO you can find anywhere! Service is good, prices are good. It is family owned and operated and they are wonderful to their customers. My favorite is the Ox Tail Pho, but all of them are great!!!!!

So I have been going here for years. We have other sushi places closer to us but drive 20 minutes because normally this is our favorite. But over the last few visits things have been getting worse and worse. The food itself is still good, the problem is the staff. We walk in and there are 2 large groups ahead of us and 1 small group. We visibility see open spots at the bar but have to wait to be seated. I hear one of the big groups talking to one of the staff members who is telling them it is going to be nearly impossible to seat them because 6 six people is too many to sit at the bar. They point out to the staff member that there is a whole row of empty tables that will work. The staff member tells them that they can sit there but will have to walk to an from the bar to get food because the owner refuses to turn that side of the conveyor belt on. They reach an agreement and get seated. Meanwhile more chair are opening and we still can't go to them (a total of 20 minutes) because no one is bothering to clean them off or check the names in the list. When we finally get seated our waiter takes our drink order, puts it down, and proceeds to disappear for the rest of our visit. The staff mostly stands around or talks with each other and had no sense of urgency when it came to taking care of us. No one ever checked in and we had to wave someone else down to get our check. He had to count 3 different times the number of plates we had, and then got someone else to come over and check his counting.  I am hoping that the owner sees this, I hope they take note and open up the second side again. I hope they hear the service their staff is giving.

Very awesome Thai! The restaurant is super clean, decorated tastefully, there were fresh flowers on the table which is not a must but very nice and inviting to see.  The staff was super friendly and helpful making sure drinks were always filled and we had enough rice. The portions were generous, I had the duck curry and ended up taking half home because I was so full. They do a 1-5 scale, I choose 2, which was a perfect between mild and medium.  If you are in the area and craving Thai, you definitely need to go in!!!!!

I love this place! Reminds me of my trip to Japan. I recommend the tonkatsu traditional style. If you haven't been and like Japanese food the definitely go!

One of our fav breakfast places! Nothing on the menu will disappoint!!!!! Great place for when you want a classic breakfast done perfectly. Staff is always friendly, restaurant always clean. Even when super busy it is never super loud which is nice in the morning.  It is the type of place though that you will not need lunch if you eat breakfast. The portions are huge!  Some of our favorites are the SOS and the Biscuits and Gravy. I always get the grits instead of potatoes.

I am two months in being vegetarian and have been struggling a little with the transition. Most places I have encounter that are full vegetarian have a lot lacking in flavor and texture. However, this place nails both!!!!! There is so much flavor, and a million things to choose from! They have awesome teas and lemonades, plus a wide variety of adult beverages. The staff is super welcoming and even at their busiest are still super friendly. The prices are very reasonable and you feel full after the meal. My husband was skeptical (as he is still a meat and potatoes guy) but came with me to support me. The chili cheese fries and Big WAC won him over to come here with me. I can't rave enough about this place! Vegan done the way all vegan should be done! I can't wait to come back!

First time here, this place was AMAZING!!!!! We came on a Friday Morning at 8:00 am so no wait, but I can see it being super busy on the weekends. My fianc√© got the biscuits and gravy and I got the carnitas omelette with the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes. All were awesome! Be warned that the portions are generous and to-go boxes were needed. They work with local growers and sausage makers. They bake their one pastries and biscuits. I can't rave enough about and can't wait to bring the rest of my family back!!!!!

After how my family was treated tonight and my nephew was endangered by their furniture I am NEVER going to shop at Living Spaces!!!!! Know that this company doesn't care about child safety or company integrity! She even tried to call the company up for help or an explanation and they were unconcerned with the entire problem.  Below is her story that happened tonight. Photos have been shared on this page.  "Friends and Family, Please DO NOT SHOP AT LIVING SPACES!!! Tonight around 7pm, Jude found something VERY disturbing that came from the sofa we purchased from Living Spaces just over a year ago . He had been playing in the family room with his toys, and crawled towards the couch. I had gotten up to through away a piece of trash and when I came back he was pulling his arm out from under the couch and put something I didn't recognize in his mouth! I quickly grabbed it to retrieve it and it was a dried chili pepper with 3 upholstery staples in it! Seeing as though Ryan and I have never owned dried chili peppers nor do we use upholstery staples we flipped over the couch to make sure there weren't anymore. But when we did that, what we found was that our supposedly "NEW" couch had been patched on the bottom and the original bottom layer of the couch has a massive hole! This patch is made out of the same material but was just poorly adhered over the hole to cover it up. The hole is about 12 inches across! Big enough that the bottom fabric should have been completely replaced but was decided to just try and cover it up and not tell us! I tried calling them but all they could say is I've owned the couch for a year and they won't do anything. They didn't even care or blink an eye nor show concern about my child! We had a warranty claim problem with Living Spaces and their bogus warranty company Ultra Shield before, we bought their warranty but when we tried to report damage they just told us it wasn't covered, meanwhile their fine print basically says nothing is covered. Even so we moved on, but this is absolutely ridiculous!!! Not only has Living Spaces sold us DAMAGED furniture as new without telling us but there is HAZORDUS material inside! Ryan and I just finished baby proofing that room but there is NOTHING we could have done to protect Jude from this. Please share with your friends and family so their kids don't get hurt and so they don't get screwed over by them! Just NEVER shop there! They certainly don't care about their customers or the product they are selling!"

You have to do the Lunch Buffet! So good and very reasonable! The building interior needs some TLC but that doesn't take away from the food or hospitality. The buffet is done fairly mild so that it is not too spicy for most people but is still very flavorful.

First time coming here after a recommendation from my sister. It is some of the best Mexican Food in the area! Great prices, generous portions, friendly staff. If you are having problems finding it it just s behind the Pet Cub. Another plus is they have a drive through for easy take out!!!!! I got the fry bread with steak and it was perfect, not greasy or oily but perfectly crispy! If you are in the area it is a defiant must!!!!!
