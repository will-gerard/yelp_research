The restaurant lives up to it's name by same, it's a "different point of view". I loved being able to look over the city at night and see all the way to downtown. My boyfriend and I had a great table towards the end of the restaurant and had a view of the city and the mountain. The restaurant was offering a "summer prix fix" menu that allowed you to get an appetizer, an entry, and a dessert for only $40. We decided to do that but wanted to share an appetizer before. I guess our server didn't understand us, and brought us two appetizers instead and after we explained the error he still charged us. The experience and food was great but I think the servers could be friendlier. At the end of the meal we wanted to get a picture so we went to the floor below the restaurant to take a picture and the two servers acted like it was such a kink in their schedule to take one picture of us. All in all the food, atmosphere, and the company triumphed the bad service and I would recommend this for a date night.

This is the absolute unfriendliest place I have ever worked with. They not only disrespected my fianc√© when he was picking up mine and my mother's furs but they were rude to me because I was questioning a $300 invoice. The women who work there are so old they barely know how to operate a computer and their lack of customer service is appalling. I am pulling my fur from them and will NEVER use them again. Beware!!!

I've been going to Seville for years and love them! Not only do they do a great job but their customer service is impeccable. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a great dry cleaning place that is VERY reasonably priced! Thank you for always being loyal to your customers :)

I am so thankful to have met Michael and Carole Breton of Breton's Automotive Group. I have worked with them through my foundation and also because Mike wanted to buy an old truck from my father. Since then this company has helped introduce me to new people and they helped the families a part of my Angels Around Us grant program have a special holiday season. Mike and Carole organized a toy drive at a holiday party they were hosting and their guests donated car loads of toys for my foundation. Seeing local companies like this one give back to our community means a lot to me and they will forever be an automotive repair shop I recommend to others. They are honest and good people and I am looking forward to building this relationship for many years to come. Thank you for everything you have done for me, my family, and the Pearce Family Foundation.

I am so impressed with the customer service Epic Valet provides to everyone. I am the CEO of the Pearce Family Foundation and asked them to make a donation to our silent auction, and not only did they respond immediately but they gave us a fabulous item. Thank you for supporting the community and believing in our cause!

I went there last week and was not impressed with the process, there were about 6 people sitting at the front desk all playing on the computer and not one looked up when i was standing there waiting to be checked in.  I finally get checked in and i asked for a magazine and they gave me an almost dead ipad "which has a lot of reading material on it" along with gross fingerprints all over it. Then my stylist was pretty rough with my hair and she made a rude comment about how my extensions needed to be redone. I figured it was because I didnt get them done there and so she needed to make a dig at them. She probably over heated the round brush more than 10 times burning my scalp and the finished product was something I could've done. I would not recommend this location it seems like a free for all in there and it was not very clean.

I went there yesterday and enjoyed the yummy special they had going on, tacos for $2 and deals on margaritas. It's a great spot if you're walking around and have a pet because they allow animals on their patio. The drinks were yummy and it was fun to people watch. The only concern was the server forgot about us towards the end and we had to ask the hostess twice to find her.

This place is totally overpriced and was a waste of 2 hours. I got there 10 minutes before my appointment and they made me wait a good 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment. By the time my gel manicure was done and it was time for my pedicure they were closing up shop and turning off the music and the movie that was playing. It made me feel like they were just waiting on me and I was wasting their time. It wasn't my fault they were running behind and they shouldn't rush a customer out who ended up spending $100 on a pedicure and a gel manicure... WAY TOO EXCPENSIVE!!!! The nail tech was totally unprofessional too she was asking about my relationship with my boyfriend and was out of line with the comments she was saying. I will never go back and would recommend you don't either.

I love this place. I was looking for a new nail salon and was so happy I found Two Hearts. I have been telling everyone to come here. There are a ton of pedicure chairs which would make this for a great party location for a bridal shower or a birthday party. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating!

I was so happy when the Parlour moved from North Scottsdale to their new location. I would travel any distance to have my hair done by Maddie because she is the best, but I think they have a prime location. I would recommend checking this place out, because you are in and out in a reasonable amount of time. I used to go to salons where half my day would be spent sitting in the chair. At the Parlour you have great service and the outcome is always superb (and your entire day isn't wasted). There is a constant flow of clients of all ages coming in and out, so if you need a new hair salon I would highly suggest the Parlour!

I was so excited to try out this place because it was right down the street from Audi North Scottsdale and I love the Quarter.  My boyfriend and I were starving so we headed over and as soon as we opened the doors we should've turned around. The lighting in there made you feel like you were being investigated and the whole atmosphere was uncomfortable. We ordered our food and the lady taking our order acted like we were regulars and rattled off the cheese and meat options so fast we couldn't even understand her. She was not very friendly or accommodating after I found out you could add avocado to your meal so I went without. I will never go back and think you need to train your staff better and find some new over head lights. No one at any time of day look or feel good under fluorescent lights. Oh and your wifi doesn't work.

I just had Tracy cut 5 inches off of my hair and LOVE it! She made me feel so comfortable and I trusted her as soon as I met her to do this huge change for me. I had never gone to this salon before but as soon as I walked inside I immediately felt like I had made the right decision. I will for sure be back and recommend this place to anyone looking for a change or a salon in Scottsdale!

I was driving down the street and saw the Happy Junk Removal truck go by and immediately thought of the broken dresser I needed to get rid of. Within minutes of calling them the truck was pulling up to my house and getting rid of an eye sore in my backyard. I didn't know what I was going to do with that piece of junk, so thank you for taking it off my hands!

Lil Leto Catering not only has amazing food but they are also very charitable. I hired Mike's team to help with a fashion show I put on for my foundation and he exceeded my expectations. We hand selected the menu together and came up with great items for my guests. The event we hosted helped to raise funds for families at the home who have a child suffering from a chronic or life threatening illness and that night we were able to raise almost $20,000. The event would not have been as successful if my guests were hungry or not loving the food. I saw people going back for seconds and thirds and we ran out of everything! I look forward to working together again and can't thank you enough for all your hard work that night!
