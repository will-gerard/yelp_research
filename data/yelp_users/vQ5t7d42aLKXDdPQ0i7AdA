Been here once or twice before, I remember liking it for the most part. This time I got the Chicken Parmesan Panini. Very good, very tasty. Endless bread and oil to start you off, don't fill up on it though. You'll have no room for dinner. Hahah.   Worth the money? Yep.  Service was fantastic. Damon was our server, best service I've had in a while. He was extremely friendly, immediately gauged that we were a "fun" table and had a good time messing around with us, and vice versa. Always good to have a laugh with the waiter, and it never hurts the tip amount , either. ;)   Anyways, very good experience overall. Would definitely recommend to any friend looking to have a nice, decently priced meal with good customer service.

I can't even.. This place, man. Being a regular has its perks. Every time I walk in there in the morning, Brittie welcomes me - "Hey Tate! We doing the usual today?" As well as making me feel like a valued customer, as well as a friend - I see that other customers appreciate it too.  On top of the fantastic customer service, my order is always, needless to say, correct. Iced Carmel/Vanilla Latté, and a Bacon Artisan Sandwich.   Side note, finally achieved my Gold Card on the rewards program.   Couldn't be happier with this location, as well as the company overall. A++++

For the record: I love Costco as a company. Adore it. So first time I came here, just shopped. Normal Costco experience, same same. Actually, the cashier was really friendly, more so than my usual Costco visits. Nice store, nice people.   UNTIL YOU GET TO THE FOOD COURT.  Holy dirty tables. Literally, out of the 25 tables available, not a single one was clean. Had to grab napkins and do it ourselves. Staff at the food court could not care less about customer service, smiling, or giving a crap in general. I saw ONE employee that helped a customer in a respectable way, but he wasn't even on the register. Just calling out orders. PUT SOMEONE FRIENDLY ON REGISTER. It's not rocket science. Take about a minute or so every so often to maintain the dining area!! I'm not expecting the Cheesecake Factory here, but at least a freaking clean table. Sheesh. Get it together, this location. Holy.

I was not expecting this place to cost so much.. My meal alone was $13.60!!! It's ridiculous that there's no combo or anything to knock off a few bucks. Although, I had the burger, and all I could think was "I can't believe this cost me $13.60 but damn this is a good burger..." It was delicious, but not for the price of an entree at the Cheesecake Factory. This place is ridiculously over-priced. Good luck staying in business.

I've literally been here 3 times in a row and been to about 4-5 of their drive-in spots didn't work. Pressed the red button 3 times in each space and nobody answered. I understand if they don't work but if they don't put an out of order sticker on them. This place sucks. A lot. But hey, it's sonic. Not setting the bar too high.

Needed a patch sewn onto a jacket. Over the phone, I was quoted at minimum of $8. Seems reasonable? So I decided to go.  Arrive to the store, not greeted, no smiles from the two teenage boys working the front. I said I spoke with a woman (I assume the seamstress) about the patch. She says no, we don't do that. Then I remind her of who I was and that we just spoke on the phone, and then she magically remembers me. That being said, she might remember the price she quoted me? Nope. Tells me it'll be $18. A $10 price jump? For what?? She never told me why. Being the polite customer that I am (and sometimes shouldn't be), I merely accepted it. (I don't like unnecessary conflict; I usually bite my tongue)  On top of that, lame front counter service from the two boys once again. Blank expressions, no smiles, no direction on how or when to pay, how or where to pick up my jacket when it was done. I had to ask HIM if we were done with the transaction, as there was no "Have a good one" or "See you Friday" or anything.   PLEASE improve customer service and have consistent, solid prices. Not happy with this place..

Just stopped by to order a drink, wanted to see what it was about considering it's right across from where I work. Walked in and was surprised.. This place is like a perfect cross between Paradise Bakery, Starbucks, and Hobby Lobby. I was greeted by two girls at exactly the same time when I walked in, which was pleasant. Then looked at the menu for a bit, very similar to Paradise, which was my previous job. She asked if I was new here, I said yes and that I used to work at Paradise, and she shook her head and immediately said it's nothing like Paradise.. Which is funny because it definitely is. Just ordered a Piña Colada smoothie and got it within 2 minutes.   Overall not too bad! I'll try to stop in there again to update the review.   #stayposted

Car wash is usually standard. They miss some things, but overall the wash is usually ok.   Now, for the Staff..  Been to this location at least 6 times; each and every time, I get friendly service with a smile - until the pushy sales pitch.   I understand the concept of up-selling and working on commission, trust me. However, having friendly service and a smile up UNTIL I opt not to have a monthly wash.. Not okay. Every time, without fail, the attendant pitches me their monthly program and then when I say no, literally SHUTS DOWN. I say "I might look into it next time", to which he walks away to his computer without a word, prints the ticket, and sticks out his hand for me to grab it, no eye contact. I say thanks, with no response, and then go to pay. Seriously? If someone doesn't want to pay monthly for car washes, ACCEPT IT AND TELL THEM TO HAVE A NICE DAY - it's basic customer service. Copping an attitude and becoming incredibly rude does nothing besides lose you customers, which is obviously a result of their attitudes. I'm with Ben T, who also had the same problem.   No longer coming here. Bye Felicia.

This place is too hectic, too unorganized, and worst of all, customer service is awful. I think it's inherent in their setup and restaurant design to be a failure. Yelling at customers to "move out of the hallway", the careless attitude amongst every employee, and the general crazy atmosphere. Normally I'd dismiss that kind of stuff if the quality of the food was amazing, but the food is just meh. Certainly doesn't live up to the hype I always hear about it. Customer service can make or break an experience, and it mostly just shattered this one.

Jen (Franchise Owner) is amazing!! She's the only reason I have returned a few times. Talk about amazing customer service, a wealth of knowledge, and a sincere desire to help pets of all sorts. I may be moving away from Tempe soon, but will continue to return here just for the service.   Well done Pet Planet!!!
