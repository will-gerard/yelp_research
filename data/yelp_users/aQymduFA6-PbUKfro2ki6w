I'm not a fan of mexican restaurants that have crappy salsa and chips. Sorry, it's just a standard by which I live by. The chips were nothing special and did not taste freshly made (closer to store bought which wouldn't be a surprise). The salsa was 95% water which is a bummer. We had to ask for extra because there wasn't much substance.   I ordered the sampler platter dish which came with a little bit of everything. The taquitos were yummy, but that was about it. I smothered most things with guacamole to make it edible and left about half the plate. My friend had the tacos and seemed just fine with them.  The service was awesome until we were looking for the check to leave. Then we had a hard time finding our waiter. If you like Taco Del Mar you'll be satisfied, however I expected a LOT more out of a mexican restaurant in Phoenix.

Awesome job Yelp! While visiting Phoenix for a convention I found this place only a few blocks away from our hotel. We stopped in for dinner and although we were part of a small rush crowd we were quickly seated.   The waiter was humorous and prompt, and made some great recommendations for our meals. I ended up with the sweet potato pasta which is somewhat unusual for me. It was incredible! The broth was pretty sweet, but the waiter recommended the spicy ham which was a perfect balance. The wine was lovely and reasonable priced and they have a really cool way to create your appetizer charcuterie plate.   If you're a meat or cheese fan this is a definitely visit in the area. It also works well for vegetarians as the sweet potato dish rocked!

YUM!  The chalkboard of brews and wines on tap rocks! This is a definite must visit if you're around the convention center at all. It's an easy walk from most hotels and will keep you out of the crowds.  I got the gaucho tacos and a glass of red blended wine. Be forewarned, the wine will be chilled (which isn't all that unusual). The tacos arrived with spicy coleslaw and beans. I mixed some of the guacamole in with each taco which also featured mango chutney. It was delicious! I couldn't eat fast enough! This place is a solid restaurant choice with a fabulous ambiance. Don't be scared off by the location, it's worth visiting.
