I really want to write a good review of this company. They have a showroom just a mile or two from my house, and the sales staff all seemed so friendly, but unfortunately I am unable to say that I had a good experience.   I originally went here because the showroom was on my way to work and I was in the market for new hardwood floors. I checked with Home Depot  & Lowes. Surprisingly Arizona Hardwood Floor Supply actually had a better deal (if you include the cost of labor) than both major box stores.  A salesperson came by my house with a few samples. I picked one out and I asked if there was a way to have the hardwood transition to the tile with a seamless appearance. The salesman told me that with a little extra labor they could add a "reducer" to bring the wood floor down to the same height as the tile. It would be an extra $130 (this was detailed in the invoice/contract). I told him the "reducer" is what I wanted because I was not a fan of the rounded "T molding" you see in cheaper floors.   The installers arrived a couple of weeks later and began work promptly at 7:30am. They called me at work at 9:30 to tell me that the fire alarm was going off and asked if I could come back and shut it down.  I came home, shut the alarm off and went back to work.  I came back home for lunch to check on the dogs. At this point about 75% of the work was done. And finally when I came home for good at around 4:30 they were just finishing up and I noticed they had installed "T- Molding". It didn't look as bad as I had imagined and the rest of the floor looked great so I figured I would just call the sales guy the next day and ask him to take the $130 off the final charge.  That was three days ago. I got a call today from a person whom I have never dealt with before. He wanted to confirm the final amount that they were going to charge my credit card. I told him about the T-molding issue and he refused to take that off the bill, he said that reducers are against code. I asked him why it is specifically listed there on the invoice then?  He then said that T-molding costs the same as the reducers. I was starting to get upset at this point. He also said that they will be charging me for an extra hour of grinding/leveling which would be $65 (the first 2 hours were free and in the contract). I explained that I was at my home throughout the day and didn't see them grinding at all, let alone for 3 hours.  Apparently I signed a document with the installers agreeing to pay for an extra hour of grinding. The installer never told me about an extra hour, probably because he knows I never saw them grinding during the day.    After another 10 minutes of haggling over the phone I think we were both fed up and I agreed to pay the extra grinding charge because that's what I signed off on but he would take off the extra $130 for the reducers.    So long story short, the floor looks great, but I came away feeling like these guys were trying very hard to nickel and dime me for materials and services that I did not agree to.

Ignore that 5 star rating I just gave Zinc Bistro.  You should avoid this place at all costs. That way I will never again have to wait for a table at my favorite French restaurant.   While your at it - stay away from the DMV too. Thanks :)

Flo's is awesome! I love all the unconventional Asian dishes available here. They offer mainstream Chinese as well as some other delights from off the beaten path. The curries are all very good. And they make the best brown rice in town. A very solid restaurant. Great choice for a quick lunch under $20.

There are two activities in this world that I have never understood why women enjoy them.  Shopping and getting their hair done. While I still have no idea why women like to shop, I think I understand why getting a haircut appeals to so many. All it took was for me to go to a place where there was a partnership between myself and my stylist. I have been to Choppers  5 or 6 times and Erica has been fantastic each time. I feel like she really takes pride in doing a good job and she comes off as being genuinely friendly as opposed to the type of stylist that initiates artificial conversations that we have all uncomfortably endured at one time or another. And not once have I walked in here only to be greeted by a young employee who is now pissed that she has to stop texting, stand up and help a new customer. The employes at Choppers all make me feel welcome as soon as I arrive. A great place to get a haircut.

Not the best sushi in the world but I appreciate the value of their lunch specials as well as the charm, panache and mystique of the bartenders.   Tip - They also make a fantastic squid salad.

I have been getting my car repaired here for years but I must report I have lost my confidence in this business. I had new tires put on this summer. About a week later my brakes began to squeak. As soon as I got back to AZ I took the car in and asked them to look at the brakes. Two hours later, they told me everything was fine and the squeaking should stop now. One day later the brakes began squeaking again. I took the car in for a third time. This time the manager actually showed me one of my brake pads and showed me how they missed the issue the first time. Apparently my car has a special emergency brake they were not aware of. He went on to explain this time they will definitely fix it...... Sure enough my brakes started squeaking again later that evening. I would give them one star if it were not for the fact that they did not charge me for the last two visits.

There is a great scene in the movie High Fidelity where John Cusack's character, Rob Gordon is "dying a long slow death" at a dinner party full of pretentious, nouveau riche snobs, including the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones. Rob thinks to himself..... "Of course there's envy: why isn't my life like this? Sure I want their money and clothes and jobs and opinions. And I'd like to have advice on jet lag, but that's not it. I mean they're not bad people and I'm not a class warrior, it's something else."   If I were to sit here and attempt to write an educated, articulate and accurate appraisal of how good Hiro's sushi is than I would be just like one of those snobs Rob so despised.  I wish I could tell you how I could taste the freshness of Hiro's tuna, or how the mackerel was served at just the right temperature, but I need to recognize my culinary limitations. I have never lived near the ocean. I have never been to Japan, and until about two years ago all I ever knew of sushi were the ubiquitous "rolls" that we have come to know all too well.   Lately however I have been ordering more sashimi and nigiri trying to learn the nuanced flavors of the fish, rice and combination of the two. I will try to stop dunking everything in soy sauce and wasabi, and whenever possible I will order omakase and let the chef take over.   For the time being I believe that Hiro is a really good place to continue my sushi education. My first visit went well. The restaurant itself certainly passes the eyeball test. Hiro appears to be very authentic. The service was friendly and fast, and the fish portions were very generous. And yes, everything I had tasted wonderful, I just don't yet have the expertise to be able to honestly explain exactly why it was better than other sushi joints around town.

Seriously! What is the deal with the wait at this place?!! I have been going to Oregano's for over ten years now (including the old town location) and like clockwork there is always at least a one hour wait.  It makes no difference if they add more patio room, expand into the building next door or even open up a brand new location 5 miles away at the PV Mall. There is always a agonizing wait! Of course - this isn't Oregano's fault. Unless they start taking reservations, raise prices, or botching the food I don't think there is anything they can do about how popular they are.   As far as the food goes, the menu is a kind of bastardized Italian. Nothing appears to be authentic unless you count the pizza as authentic NY style thin crust. Everything else  on the menu seems to have been put there to appeal to anyone on this planet who has ever uttered the phrase "Damn I'm starving". Or to put it a better way - if you are incredibly hungry Oregano's is without a doubt a 5 star restaurant. If you are a food snob , or on a diet, or if you rarely ever work up a healthy appetite you will probably not like it here. I always seem to be hungry and occasionally enjoy a giant plate of comfort food which is why I give Oregano's 5 stars.   Don't believe me?.... Try it for yourself. Fast all day until 6pm, then go to Oregano's, put your name on the list, sit there and watch the servers parade all that food past you for 90 minutes, then sit at your table and order a giant bowl of spaghetti and meatballs (bollo pasta). You should be in a sensational food coma by the end of the meal.

Sprouts is basically a Whole Foods without the customary grabbing of the ankles at the cash register.  They have a good selection of vitamins and supplements and a great aisle full of all natural personal care products (which appear to be working quite well judging from the appearance of the female shoppers at this particular location). The only downside is the meat/deli section. I wish they had more cuts of grass fed beef and a better selection of fresh soup.

Not too long ago I was pulling out of my garage and noticed water bubbling up through the landscape rocks in my front yard. I got out of my car to investigate. I consider myself fairly handy so I did what any respectable guy would do, I started to dig. As I dug I noticed that the seepage was coming from somewhere under the concrete driveway. BIG problem. I knew this could be very bad and I was out of my league. As a new resident in this community I walked over to a neighbors house and she recommended her regular plumber whom I promptly called. This particular plumber admitted that front yard leaks such as the one I described were not their specialty, and they recommended I call Ranch Plumbing.   I called Ranch and spoke to Vince who told me he could come by that afternoon. He also told me that I should try to immediately turn off the water at the main line so the area they they will need to inspect is not a muddy mess when they arrive. As I arrived home from work later that day, I could already see someone in the front yard digging away. Then Vince came out from his van parked nearby and gave me a rundown of the situation. He said they can fix the leak without having to replace the entire pipe. The problem was an elbow joint that was not snug, however the rest of the pipe was in good condition. This was the best part - they could have made a lot more money off me by saying that the leak was under the driveway and the whole pipe needed to be replaced. In the end, the cost was less than $200 for what appeared to be about a day and a half of hard labor and some new PVC. I was expecting it to be much more.   Before the work was complete, my yard was restored to the condition it was in prior to the digging. I really appreciated that as well.   I am giving them 5 stars because I am used to getting raked over the coals by various home services professionals. This time I came away pleasantly surprised by their quick service, honesty, and integrity.   Thanks!

Nice little sushi joint tucked away into a recessed corner of this strip mall. I went on a weeknight and it was almost full (a good sign). I was very hungry so I ordered one of those sushi combo's we often see on menu's these days.I was still a little uncertain if it would all fill me up. I was full before I even got to my tuna roll.  The roll was fantastic by the way. It had a generous portion of tuna as opposed to some tuna rolls I have had at  Sushi restaurants where the tuna is no thicker than a pencil (90% rice - 10% tuna). Sushi Ko's roll was more like 60% rice and 40% tuna. The service was very fast and friendly but not overbearing. I will be back.

For a sports bar, Ko's is about as good as it gets. Good food. Very friendly service. They have a dog friendly patio. Reasonable prices for N Scottsdale.  And no matter what your request, the staff will try to help out. This is an important aspect of a sports bar where patrons are all scrambling to get the game they want on the nearest TV. Ko's does a great job of juggling all these requests.

KO's is a great sports bar. Better food than most sports bars, friendly wait staff, and a dog friendly patio. I am very fortunate to live nearby so I can visit KO's often. Go Cardinals!!!

Fun course. My dad doesn't hit his drives very far any more so he really loves this track. Plus he is really accurate around greens which I struggle with so the two of us can still have a decent battle at Starfire. King is my favorite (except for #3... so tough). The staff are all very friendly. And I love how the course is centrally located.

I have been to 4 Peaks several times. Each visit has been a pleasant experience. As a casual microbrewery 4 Peaks does a good job. The handcrafted beers that I have tried are all very good. My personal favorite is the Kilt Lifter, an amber ale, similar to a Fat Tire but not nearly as sweet.    This Friday I met some colleagues at the 4 Peaks in North Scottsdale. A friend and I decided to split the 16" barbecue chicken pizza. This size was just right for 2 people. We both started out very hungry and still had two slices left over.  I would rate the quality of the pizza below dedicated pizza joints like Bianco, Grimaldi's and Humble Pie, but above places like Peter Piper, Zipps, etc... It was about on par with something you would get from Papa Johns or Dominos, which is just fine in my book if accompanied by a really good cold beer.   The place was full and had a lively atmosphere. The only thing missing was a good college football game. With that in mind, next time I will go on a Saturday. Cheers!

Favorite course in AZ. The fairways are soooo forgiving. I love how everything funnels into the middle of the fairway.  The staff were all very friendly. Borderline 4 star review however. Word to the staff..... Please do not tell golfers there will be food at the turn if there will not be food at the turn.... some women don't react well to challenging golf courses while running low on blood sugar. "This is my nightmare!!"

This place is the bomb. The whole atmosphere is pure mexico street joint. Let me set the scene for you. The first thing you'll see is a guy selling bootlegged DVD's in the corner (allegedly). There's usually little kids running around grabbing coke refills and putting more quarters in the jukebox, which usually blares loud, authentic mexican folk songs. There's an industrial strength jet engine fan in the far corner of the restaurant doing it's best to cool off all the patrons wiping sweat from their foreheads. There is a tiny window where you place your order,  and the entire wall around that window is composed of the menu with photos of food. The food isn't great. About what you would expect, but just as good as any mexican street vendor down in central Mexico. Lots of lard, salt and gristle. But it tastes soooo damn good! What I like best is the salsa bar, complete with all you can eat escaveche. You know, the pickled jalapenos, onions, carrots and cauliflower that make me salivate just thinking about it. If your order sucks, just pour some spicy salsa on there or better yet pour some of that vinegary escabeche juice over your dish and before you know it, it will be perfect. Your best bet is probably the carne asada taco plate. Make sure to get a cold beer to go with your meal, so you can get your mouth really burning hot, and then cool it off with the cold beer, and repeat that process about 30 more times. Pure heaven.

Have you ever been to a restaurant and you begin to notice little things that make you wonder how clean the kitchen is? That is exactly what happened to me at Kona Grill. Before I get into the details, let's back up a bit and recall that this is a Japanese restaurant. Japan.... a place where it is customary to remove one's shoes before entering a home. Japan.... the country with the highest per capita spending on antibacterial products. Japan... a place where they sell t-shirts infused with vitamin E to maintain healthy skin.  Now add these cultural mores with the simplicity and precision of Japanese cuisine. Sushi by it's very nature is clean. With all of this in mind I found it unacceptable to sit down at the bar only to have my arms quickly adhere to the sticky granite surface. Personally, I find sticky surfaces quite unpleasant. It reeks of tiny, revolting microbes latching onto my skin. I would rather rest my arms on top of a surface covered in mummy dust than something sticky. Gross.  When my sushi arrived the bartender brought out the soy sauce. The bottle was covered in translucent streaks of a white spoogy substance. So now I start thinking if the front of the house is this hygienically challenged, what does the kitchen look like. Then for the first time in years I leaned over and carefully smelled my sushi. Nothing out of the ordinary, so I began to eat my lunch (I was starving, give me a break). The food tasted fine. Generous portions of fish and the salad had just the right amount of dressing.   I finished my meal and just as I was paying the tab the bartender dropped her cutting board on the floor. She picked it up and set it next to the sink. I thought Ohhhhhhh no, please, please, please wash that cutting board before you start slicing lime wedges.  Before she could clean off the cutting board the bartender walked away to take the order of a newly arrived patron. I decided not to stick around and discover the destiny of that cutting board.   With these memories sealed forever in my mind I decided not to eat here again.

A manager from Kona recently contacted me to apologize and express his thanks for my feedback. He sounded genuinely surprised by my experience which leads me to believe this was a one-off type of mistake by the staff on that particular day. As a result, I decided to try Kona again last weekend. This time around everything was spot on. The service was fantastic and our entire dinner party really seemed to enjoy their food.

Total disaster. I hardly ever go here except for the odd occasion when I need some obscure item. Today I needed two such items so I headed over to wal mart.  And wouldn't you know it! They were out of both! All I wanted was some sugar free vanilla coffee syrup and a pair of brown dress shoe laces. They had a dozen other coffee syrups but no sugar free vanilla. And they had at least 20 different types of shoe laces but not one pair of brown dress shoes. I could see the prices for both items but this store was clearly out of stock. Maybe this is an indication that the end of the world is near because if wal mart starts running out of food our society is doomed.

This is without a doubt my favorite gallery in Scottsdale.  This is the type of gallery where you will see art that resonates with you as opposed to people you are trying to impress. They have art that you can live with every day. While much of the work in the store is not cheap, the value is definitely there.  And the customer service is fantastic. If you see something you like but cannot afford, the associates in the store will work with you to explore other options including sending you e-mails from time to time.   I recently purchased a small painting and within 2 days I received the paintings background as well as the artist bio. They also sent me photos of new paintings from another artist that I have been interested in for some time.  All in all, a great gallery. You won't be disappointed.   I would try to explain what type of art you will find here, but it would be better to check out their website as they have lots of sample works on the site.

Carlsbad Tavern is the Scottsdale version of Casa Bonita. I know, I know, there are no cliff divers, and there are no video games, but they both serve Mexican food, they both have a giant waterfall, and the whole place is like a cave so three out of five ain't bad.   The staff here are all incredibly friendly. It looked like they actually enjoyed working there. And you can tell this place is family owned. It has a certain fun factor that corporate lawyers would most likely have advised against (examples being...the giant waterfall, outdoor canal, and large objects hanging tenuously from the ceiling).   The food was pretty good. My dining companions complained of too much cheese, but this is "New Mexico" style Mexican food. What better way to "Americanize" something than to put giant portions of cheese all over it. Am I the only one who occasionally has a craving for a giant burrito covered in savory green chili sauce and melted monterrey jack?  As soon as I hear those magic words "be careful,the plate is REALLY hot!" I turn into a human version of Pavlov's dog.   The margaritas were very good, and their tomatillo salsa was top notch.

What a great time!  I came here for a Birthday party with about a dozen friends last Monday night. A nearby Giants Spring Training Game had just concluded so we were very fortunate to have had reservations. Apparently this is a favorite spot for baseball fans as evidenced by the sports themed décor.  The place was packed and teeming with activity. You would expect with all that chaos the service would be a bit sketchy, and understandably so.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Before we had a chance to sit down our server came by to take our drink orders.  All evening long, that same server was spot on. He was taking 6-7 customized orders at a time returning in less than 5 minutes with everyone's drinks.  I also noticed a large 10 top cleared out right next to our table and I saw a bartender, the owner, our server and a busboy all over there cleaning everything up and re-arranging the tables for the next guests. Amazing teamwork.   The food was very good.  All of the appetizers were great, particularly the fried calamari with spicy marinara sauce.  The regular bread in a basket was a bit dry for my taste (I prefer more chewy as opposed to flaky and crunchy), but their garlic bread was pure heaven.  For my main course I had the spaghetti with meatballs, one of the best in recent memory.  It had just the right amount of spice.

This is a nice Starbucks. The view of Camelback Mountain from their patio is amazing. Sadly, this view may be short lived as the PV Ritz Carlton is going to be built right across the street. The baristas here all appear to be mature, professional adults who actually listen to the customers as opposed to socializing with one another behind the counter.  Occasionally you will see a cougar or two come in here so make sure to keep a protective eye on your pets and small children.

One star for doing your best to make the parking situation at Camelback Mountain as aggravating as possible.  One star for pandering to your idiot residents that didn't realize that they live in the middle of a giant metropolis which means there might be traffic. If they wanted peace and quiet they should have moved to Montana. One star for paying your police officers to drive around all day long looking for hikers that park in front of someone's house.

Chain Schmain!    Pei Wei is awesome. At Pei Wei I can spend less than $10 and have a great lunch, bring my dog, relax and read a book in the shaded patio AND get myself unlimited refills of fountain drinks.  BTW, when you have access to a good soda fountain, do yourself a favor and mix in a little soda water with your diet coke. You can't taste the difference and it's much healthier for you.    According to my calculations, I have been here about 84 times now and my favorites are the Pad Thai with chicken and the sesame beef.

When I was a naïve young man I used to go out and party on weekends. It was as if every Friday was the beginning of a national holiday requiring two days of intoxicated celebration. On any given night I would drop $10 to $30 on cover charges, $50 to $75 on drinks, $10 to $20 for the 2:00AM munchies and another $20 -$30 on a cab ride home. And what was I left with? A headache, some fuzzy memories and taking inventory of decisions made the night before.     Fortunately, with age comes wisdom. I have learned that a better way to celebrate life is to embrace unique opportunities and experiences.  If I am going to spend $100 tonight I am going to spend it wisely.  Eating at Toyama is a "value added" decision in my opinion.  I have gone twice now in as many weeks and both meals were fantastic.  My sister and brother-in-law joined me last Friday.  They were here visiting from California. We decided to go for broke and order the "Omakase" - chef's choice.  When it was all said and done they both agreed that a meal like this would have cost twice as much in LA.  While I can't remember every detail, some of the highlights were as follows...  -        An amazing sashimi platter, with fresh tuna, yellowtail and uni.   -        Two different toro dishes. One Nigiri and one toro tartare dish. -        This incredible Spanish mackerel  sushi topped with a thin strip of sweet kelp. -        A custom roll with Thai hot sauce, tuna and avocado. Amazing. -        Salmon roe sushi soaked and rinsed the proper  way.  It went on and on. Each new dish was a new indescribable flavor experience. One dish had this Japanese shisho leaf on it. We were all at the table trying to come up with a comparable flavor to describe it...."It tastes like a licorice-earthy-minty-nutmegy-etc..."...sounding like wine snobs trying to come up with just the right description, only this was food.  Really good food.   We got there early and were the only patrons for awhile so part of the amazing experience was the great conversation with our chef. We talked about golf, football, chef's knives, Santa Barbara, Japanese whisky, our favorite restaurants, etc... It was so interactive.  A great meal, a great evening... a great memory. Well worth the money.

I haven't had a carb since 2004. The other day I decided I would try something new and have a bowl of spaghetti. I am sooooo glad I chose Defalco's to break the streak.  The pasta was incredibly satisfying and the meatball was the best I've had in recent memory.  I can't wait to go back in 7 years to try one of their sandwiches.

Great cocktails, kick ass burgers, and world class people watching. The decor and setting in the civic center park make this a go to destination for anyone wanting to hang out in Old Town for an evening. The service can use a bit of cheering up but all in all I had a great experience.

Best urban park in America!  A few tips....  Uphill hikers have the right of way, some of them may be timing their ascent so it's important let them pass during narrow sections of the trail.   Parking for the Echo Canyon trailhead is a major hassle. You might be better off parking along 56th street just North of Mcdonald Road. It will only take you 15 minutes to walk to the trailhead from there.  Hike early before it gets too hot and bring plenty of water.   If you are afraid or nervous around dogs just act normal. Where did all these people learn to act like a statue when a dog passes by? If anything, that strange behavior will cause a unbalanced dog to bite. Imagine you are a dog hiking up camelback, your probably very socialized because your owner is cool enough to take you places to get exercise. All day long you have been passing by hikers who just stroll by, then all of the sudden a hiker up ahead freezes like they are imitating some kind of animal defense mechanism. As a dog you will probably think..."hmmm that's odd, why is this human acting so bizarre... I better check this person out".  Maybe holding still is the tactic to use if you come upon a stray dog loose in the streets but I can't imagine that behavior being an effective choice around a well behaved dog on a leash.   Also - have you ever seen two dogs on a leash just before a scrap breaks out? I have, and I can tell you the instant before that first bite both dogs will freeze. Cats do this too, one second of stillness before the storm - so please just act normal and walk right by. The dog probably won't even notice you were there. They are too busy looking for lizards, chipmunks and other dogs.   But I digress.    I enjoy Echo Canyon for the exercise and thrill of the rock climbing, while the Cholla Trail has better views of Scottsdale, The Mcdowell Mountains, and The Phoenician.   If you do plan on bringing your dog, make absolutely sure that before you get to the top, put the dog on a leash (they should already be on a leash anyway). There are ton's of chipmunks that live on the cliff edge right at the summit. Most dogs I know will go chasing after the first chipmunk they see and I can't imagine any dog being able to stop in time to prevent their momentum from carrying the poor pup over the cliff. They would never survive that fall. And you will never forgive yourself.   Take the hike slow and easy at the beginning. I have been timing my climbs for several years now and I always have a better time when I take it slow at the beginning and pace myself.   Fair warning for narcissists! There will be dozens of people at the top when you arrive. Think of them as your audience, and you don't want to over exert yourself and look like a slobbering, puking, crying mess when you finally arrive on stage.   The full climb from each trailhead should take a beginner about 45-50 minutes. Intermediate hikers will probably make it in around 35-45 minutes, and expert hikers in really good shape should make it in about 30-35 minutes or less.   And I am no exercise expert but I don't think running down very steep hills really helps you at all. In fact it probably jacks up your joints. Going downhill slowly will most likely work all the muscles you didn't use on the way up helping balance your workout. The only thing your working by running down camelback are the laws of gravity. So take it easy champ, everyone knows you didn't run on the way up.

Solid 4 Star Restaurant! Great Margaritas. Fantastic salsa and guac. Friendly service. Spacious and comfortable patio. All in all, this is one of those places that makes me wish I lived around the corner. I would be here all the time.

Let's face the facts. Most movies these days suck. Hollywood is running out of ideas. Movies about comic book characters, movies about old TV shows, the same old horror film with the same creepy kid, romantic comedies that are neither romantic nor funny, and action films where explosions act as filler for a vacant plot. All of these movies are being made by business executives first and artists second. And it doesn't end there. On the off chance that Hollywood miraculously makes a great film they quickly ruin it by making a disgusting and embarrassing sequel (see Hangover Part 2). South Park had it right, George Lucas and Steven Speilberg raped Indiana Jones. Movie producers are raping all of our intellects every time they release another sloppy bucket of hamster vomit otherwise known as "the summer blockbuster". And yes.. I'm talking to you Jerry Bruckheimer!..You Jacka$$!  One way to avoid being raped by another vapid, money sucking movie studio is to watch movies at the Camelview 5. You could close your eyes and throw a dart at the marquee here and end up watching an original, intelligent, and entertaining film. This is where I saw Napoleon Dynamite before everyone started buying "Vote for Pedro" t-shirts. This is where I saw No Country for Old Men before it took home four Oscars. This is where I saw The Smartest Guys in the Room before it was cool to know all about financial scandals on Wall Street. I could go on and on. I have been living in the Valley for over 10 years now and almost every great movie memory I have during that time emanates from the Camelview 5.

4.5 stars.   The other day I received a $50 gift card in the mail for Flemings Steakhouse. There has to be a catch right? Apparently not. I registered the card on Flemings website and made reservations for the following Friday evening.   The gift card specifically stated "valid only in the main dining room" but I noticed that college football was on the TV in the bar. My dinner companion also enjoys football so I asked the hostess if we could still use my gift card in the bar, she kindly told us, "sure, as long as you order off the dinner menu." Perfect.   I quickly realized that my $50 wasn't going to get me very far. Most entrees were in the $30+ range and everything was a la carte. I ordered the scallops with puff pastry and veggies. For my side, what else but macaroni and cheese.  The scallops were very good. Cooked perfectly. The puff pastry wasn't bad either. The macaroni and cheese on the other hand was sublime (I hate that word, but I couldn't think of another way to describe it). My dining companion also has a fantastic fillet and his sauteed mushrooms was a bit garlicky, but also very good. He had a fillet at Ruth's Chris recently and told me the Flemings steak won hands down. I knew I should have ordered a steak!    I know that Flemings is part of a large corporate chain, and I hate chains, but I have to admit my dinner experience here was great. I just hope I get a promotion at work soon so I can come here more often, or maybe they will continue to send me $50 gift cards, but I doubt it.

I took my father and little brother here last week. All three of us had fantastic dinners. My brother had of all things one of the best filet mignon's I have tasted in a long time. My father had a side dish of phenomenal asparagus spears. I had a perfectly seasoned seafood pasta dish, Not too creamy, or salty leaving room for the flavors of the shellfish to emerge and blend into the sauce.   The service was excellent. There were no tables available in the dining room and the cocktail waitress did her best to make us feel like were not in the bar.   I could be a "chain restaurant" snob and rip this place apart but I can't.... everything was very good. I would definitely recommend it for a quality meal with friends or family.

The best Breakfast I have had in at least 10 years. When we walked in the whole place had this wonderful mesquite campfire smell. The carne asada I ordered was amazing. It had the perfect amount of charred, smoky, red chille flavoring and made this one memorable meal.

This review is attributable to the First Friday Event that took place on April 1st 2011.  Sorry folks, First Fridays is not for me. I went last week hoping to discover an exciting new aspect of the Valley's cultural ascendance but I left feeling totally bummed. The whole scene felt like a sort of bizarro reverse Scottsdale Fashion Square counterculture. Like day vs night, conformists vs non-conformists, capitalists vs social anarchists.  I felt like I was engulfed by people trying so hard not to fit in that they somehow managed to become clones of themselves. And you know what sucks about the whole thing?... I'll bet there are dozens of extremely talented young artists whose work is completely overwhelmed by sheer sensual overload of this spectacle. A perfect example would be this fantastically talented young girl singing and playing guitar. She couldn't be more than 16 years old. Great voice. About 35 feet away there was loud punk rock band jamming away completely drowning out our fresh faced heroine. Or, was it the opposite? Maybe I was the one who was wrong and it was my youthful singer whose little amplifier managed to get in the way of an even more talented band, maybe Phoenix's version of Social Distortion or the Misfits? Either way, I was totally disoriented....... and bummed.    I felt the same way about the conventional art on display. I made a concerted effort to find unique works, possibly a piece that really resonated with me that I would want to see on a wall in my home. Instead 90% of what I saw there reminded me of the doodles and art class projects that my friends and I used to create when our lives were devoted to playing Dungeons and Dragons and watching Hellraiser marathons on VHS.    On a side note, is it just me or do young people who devote their lives to blood, gore, pain and suffering annoy anyone else? If these kids think life sucks now I can't wait to see them after they end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans only to realize that their newfound reality will be years and years of toiling away in the friendly confines of a 6 square foot gray cubicle. And compared to many third word citizens this new reality would be considered paradise. It's that lack of perspective that I have a hard time accepting. But we all go through our phases and I wish them the best of luck.   Trust me, I feel horrible that I have to write a negative review. I know there is some really great stuff out there. I just couldn't find it. It didn't take me long to simply give up and start drinking. Fortunately we found a cool little place to drown our sorrows called "Lost Leaf" which turned out to be one of the highlights of my evening.   The only way I would go back is if someone convinces me that they can show me all the hidden gems at First Friday buried amongst the dark alleys and dusty, vacant lots. If that happens I would be glad to revise my review and formally apologize for not having the patience to discover these cultural treasures on my own.   And before you rip me apart for not having the ability to see the true beauty of this event please understand that I have read Chomsky, Zinn, Hitchens etc...I spent much of my youth hobnobbing with homeless buskers at The Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. I studied Marx and Engels in college and I have spent entire days soaking it all in at the Pompidou and Musee d'Orsay. And to top it off, I hand wrote "Nader" on my presidential ballot once, and might do it again someday. So spare me the tired accusations of xenophobia and intolerance. BTW...Go Buffs!

KIerland Commons is a fantastic development. Lots of great shopping, restaurants, lofts, etc.... Only problem for me is that I live in Scottsdale and frequent the Scottsdale Public Library, therefore I want my tax dollars to go into Scottsdale's coffers so I will try to do most of my shopping and dining across the street at the Scottsdale Quarter (except for Zinc Bistro - I'll keep going to Zinc regardless of what zip code it's in).

I a big fan of Trader Joe's. It is a bit out of my way, but I try to come here at least once a week to stock up on the best deals in organic eggs, nuts, milk, fruits and vegetables. They even have 100% grass fed organic ground beef.  I can get organic dog treats here, all natural dish soap, trail mix and a nice bottle of French beaujolais for a great price. It's actually quite remarkable that they fit so much good stuff into that little store.   My only complaint as a single guy is that most of the produce comes in bunches.... 4 apples, 6 tomatoes, a bag of onions, etc... I don't want to waste food so sometimes its hard to get all the ingredients I need without being forced to buy too much.   Aside from that the store is great. And during the holidays keep your eyes open for those wonderful "Joe-Joe's".  You will love them.

I just had a fantastic lunch at Saigon Nites. Right from the start, I had a feeling it would be good because there were THREE different types of hot sauces already on my table when I sat down. A sriracha, a plastic ketchup bottle containing "fresh hot sauce", and a little white bowl of chili oil. A great start in my book.   The restaurant was busy, as was the wait staff. All three employees were doing triple duty taking turns serving patrons, cooking, and keeping an infant occupied with toys and a laptop in the corner of the room. This gave the place a kind of homey feel, a subtle assurance that the food will be authentic, possibly based on generational family recipes.   The service was fast, friendly and informative. After ordering the chicken pho, one of the servers quickly brought me a plate of fresh basil and bean sprouts. As a pho novice I stopped the waitress and asked how to properly eat the pho with all of these wonderful ingredients on my table. She kindly told me when the soup comes out I should put the sprouts and basil in the broth, as much as I like. She explained that most Vietnamese usually put sriracha in their pho, however, she prefers the chili oil.   When the pho arrived I basically put the kitchen sink in there. I started out with the sriracha on one side of the bowl and chili oil on the other. Tasting each side before co-mingling the spicy goodness. It was fantastic. The noodles couldn't be better. There was a bit of gristle in one of the pieces of chicken, but it's not a big deal for a $7 lunch. Tip - if I had to do it over again, I would probably skip the sriracha and use about a tablespoon of chili oil. I think I over did it and the strength of the hot sauces eventually overwhelmed the balanced simplicity of the original flavors.   Another example of Saigon Nites authenticity.... If you look hard enough, the menu has a little section of "French" sandwiches with pickled daikon. As a history buff (see - French Indochina) this little nugget of information has me quite intrigued and now I know what to order next time.   I left feeling glad that this restaurant is so close to where I live and work. I definitely plan on coming back... often.

I am going to keep this review brief so I don't accidentally write some smart ass comment about steroids or orange skin and have some giant gorilla beat the sh&# out of me in the parking lot.    The membership deal is a good value. It's not too busy. They have decent equipment. They repair broken machines rather quickly. They have plenty of convenient parking. And a nice location near a whole foods and costco.

I love the food at Flo's but the parking and interior acoustics are dreadful. I know, I know, it's not Flo's fault that the parking is difficult, but Yelp is here to help others make educated dining decisions and I think the parking issue is relevant. So there you have it.

We need more places like this in Scottsdale. I stopped in for breakfast Saturday morning. Ordered the Lox and Bagel..... Fantastic! And a great Value. Other reviewers have suggested that Chloes is rather pricey but I disagree. The Lox and Bagel with fountain drink came to less than $10. I would have spend $13+ at Lox Stock and Bagel, $11+ at Chompies and around $10 at Einsteins.  Also - I like how all the ingredients are nicely spread out on the plate so I can put together my sandwitch just the way I like it. And the smoked salmon was just perfect. Thicker than most but not so thick that it became flakey.   I would have given them 5 stars but they forgot to include capers even thought I asked for them. Maybe next time.

Thanks to Cox Cable, the Coyotes v Blackhawks playoff games are only being televised on Fox Sports AZ Plus (whatever the hell that is). I am an optimist though, so while I won't be able to watch the Stanley Cup Playoffs this year at least I have the Lifetime channel, which makes my $100 monthly cable bill totally worth it! Long story short I had to go to a friends house to watch the game. On my way over there I decided to stop and pick up a pizza. My friend is a vegetarian so I had to pick something tasty yet humane that we would both enjoy while watching the ensuing hockey bloodbath. I ordered a large Julius & Darius with Feta Cheese, Assorted Olives, Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers and Sautéed Onions. It was fantastic. The ingredients were nicely balanced. Every bite had subtle hints of each flavor including the sublime tomato sauce. The Coyotes ended up winning, the pizza was great and the Tecate was cold so if it wasn't for my crazy dog pissing on my friends carpet the evening would have been perfect.

Great overall experience. I strolled in tonight, a first timer not really knowing much about the finer points of charcuterie.  I was greeted kindly by the guy behind the deli cooler. I asked him to give me a half a pound of his spiciest salami and a baguette.  I planned on taking this home to make a great sandwich.  While my order was being sliced, I wandered around the store looking at all of the great italian food products. Pastas, olives, breadsticks, pastries, you name it, it was all there.   Long story short, I got home about ready to make my sandwich, and tried a slice of the salami. Incredible! There was no way in hell I was going to put this inside two slices of bread and dilute the flavor with mustard, mayo, cheese, etc... Instead, I  sliced up the baguette, grabbed some brie, and made myself a mini smorgasbord. The salami ruled the day. The bread wasn't bad either.  I can't wait to go back for lunch and try some cheese and bresaola or maybe a full sandwich.

In today's day and age, with the popularity of sites like Yelp, you have to feel bad for the sports bar proprietor.  They all seem to follow a standard formula yet at the same time there are so many ways to potentially upset your customers.  "The game I want to watch isn't on"...."the sound of the game I want to hear isn't on"...."the big TV is showing the wrong game".... "the volume of the game is too loud"... "why are you playing music when MY team is playing on TV?" I could go on and on.   And then you have the food. Charge more than $8 for a quesadilla and you are waaaay over priced. Charge less than $8 and put the food in a plastic basket and your establishment is "trashy" or "cheap".   You also have all those weekly specials and happy hour deals. More variables that can piss someone off.    Bottom line - for a sports bar, let me repeat that..., for a SPORTS BAR Temple Bar does a pretty good job. 4 stars. The game I wanted to watch was on several of their HD flat screen TV's. One of those TV's was close enough for me to follow the action. The sound was a bit loud but I could still hear my friends talk. The menu featured several decent $5 apps for happy hour. The food was greasy, most likely from pre-packaged frozen supplies and I don't feel very healthy anymore, but it was no worse than any other fried food I have had at a run of the mill sports bar.  Most important of all, my friends and I shared some laughs, had a good time, and I'm definitely full.   Oh - and the bathrooms were clean. Another plus.

I am going to give this place 4 stars purely because the hostess was so incredibly nice and helpful. I arrived at around 6:30 and tables were filling up fast. I told the hostess that 1) I don't know how many people would be joining me, 2) I don't know how long it will be before they all arrive and 3) I wanted a table by a TV so I could watch the Sugar Bowl. She told me to relax, grab a beer at the bar and she'll take care of everything.  Sure enough about 5 minutes later she came over and grabbed me, told me that a 4-top just left and I should sit there and hold on to that spot before someone else gets it.  Long story short, 2 friends showed up 5 minutes later and we had a decent meal.   The sushi is interesting, most of it could probably pass for soft candy as everything was covered in a syrupy sauce but also full of flavor.   And apparently they have happy hour 24-7 so the drinks were a very good value.   As long as they keep hiring friendly people to man the joint I am comfortable recommending this place.   Fair warning - the whole atmosphere is 100%  pure Scottsdale. Walls of leather and suede covered in various shades of purples and pinks complete with hand blown pendant lights, so if that kind of ambiance bothers you, you might want to go somewhere else.

Great lunch specials. I had kung pao chicken, soup and brown rice for less than $6 today. The veggies in the kung pao were fresh, not frozen like some chinese restaurants. Also, their mushrooms were fantastic. They actually tasted like mushrooms as opposed to limp soggy mushrooms that spent all day soaking up whatever sugary sauce they were swimming in all day. All in all, a good, quick choice if you are in the neighborhood or want to order take out or delivery.

Great little gyros joint run by what appears to be a real Greek family. The $9'ish gyros plate comes with plenty of food. The rice and salad were the highlight of my meal. There was a little grissle in my meat slices, but maybe that means it's authentic... I wouldn't know as I have never been to greece. It still tasted damn good. Fair warning, the last time I went there for lunch it was very busy and all the tables were full. Several customers ended up eating while sitting on the sidewalk. Maybe it will slow down when all the snowbirds head home.

Great Trail! I love how you can do a full loop only backtracking for about 100 yards of the trail. The trail also offers connections to other more challenging hikes like Sunrise Peak, etc...  Bring your dog as there will be several other adventure pups for him/her to meet.   The best part of this trail is the wildlife. In the past three months alone I have seen several lizards, rabbits, chipmunks, coyotes, and two large deer. Oh - and I almost stepped on a very large rattlesnake so be careful during the summer.  My foot landed about 5 inches from the snakes head. Most of his body was in a bush, however the snake didn't seem to mind that I almost stepped on it. Apparently they don't bite unless you aggravate them.

5 Stars. Best Ice Cream Ever! Not only that, after all the publicity and success, and the long lines at all hours, they still have the most amazing customer service. Allow me to explain. I was there last night. I brought a book and my dog. I tied the pup to a table outside and got in line. After waiting for about 15 minutes I finally put in my order and then went to the cash register to pay. The owner rang me up (I can't remember her name but I have seen her on TV) I handed her my American Express card and she said "I'm sorry, we don't take American Express" I thought...just my luck, I lost my Visa Debit card last week and still haven't received the replacement. All I had was my AMEX card, and now after waiting all that time I have to hand over my rocky road!! I told her how sorry I was, how I should have checked before they took my order. I gave her back my ice cream and turned around and left. As I was untying my dog outside, the owner came rushing out to me..."I just remembered there is an app for that" she said..."I can run your Amex card on my phone". I came back in, she swiped my card into a little device on her phone and I signed the receipt. She went to the fridge, grabbed my ice cream and handed it to me.   Throughout the whole ordeal she was so composed and friendly, especially considering that I created a delay for everyone waiting and I should have checked the credit credit card options before going in there.   The "cherry on top" was the ice cream itself. Words can't begin to describe. Simply superb. I can't wait to go back to try some of their more unusual flavors.

Is it just me, or has all asian food seemingly morphed into a hodgepodge of the same 5 dishes. Meat, a few vegetables swimming in a thick sugary sauce. At Thai house, you get a nice break from this monotony. This evening I ordered the Spicy Thai Noodles. Wide flat noodles, with onions, red bell peppers, and fresh basil. It was fantastic. As far as I can tell there was no sauce to speak of. Just a mild flavored oil tossed with slightly charred noodles, beef and veggies. I actually tasted each ingredient. Nothing on my plate was overwhelmed by anything else. Perfect.   I also like how you can specify your order's spiciness on a scale of 1-5. If you really want a kick, the scale actually goes up to 15, but only insiders know about that.   The service is very friendly as well as fast. A little too fast for my taste as I only read about 10 pages in my book before I was done and the bill arrived.   Next time I will stall 'em somehow.... or order an appetizer.

Rip Off Alert! I asked the salesperson if they could bring back the new shine on my headlights. The lights had become faded and a there was a very faint yellowish hue. She told me they could do it for $60. Sounded like a decent deal considering my mechanic explained it would be $200. When my car was finished the headlights looked basically the same. They were shiny but still slightly yellow. I asked to speak to the salesperson from earlier. She came over and I explained how the lights looked the same. She called one of the detailers over and talked to him about it. He raced off and quickly returned with a rag and a tube of some impressive looking cleaning substance. He began scrubbing away. He was rubbing those lights at 100 miles an hour and he two of us were just standing there watching him. It was so demeaning. I felt terribly uncomfortable watching this poor guy slave away in the hot sun. He kept looking up at us as if he was looking for our approval of his hard work. She said to me "it's looking better right"? At this point what am I supposed to say? She then explained how the only way to really get rid of that yellow haze was to open up the headlight casing and clean it out from the inside. And how I would have to take it to a mechanic for that. I finally had enough and just wanted to go home.  All in all, a miserable experience. On a positive note - at least I managed to avoid the windshield repair guys and several years of hard sell phone calls from their miserable company.

Before I forget, I need to say that the location is perfect, particularly on the patio in November when it's a dreamlike 70 degrees at 7:30pm.    We were there last Thursday and the courtyard area of the waterfront had a peaceful level of pedestrian activity and a folksy band playing music nearby (including a flutist with her own unique Katie Perry interpretation).  We started with the Oysters. I am no shellfish expert but these looked fresh, and they tasted good, even better with a little extra horseradish and cocktail sauce.  We also tried the escargot. The only low point of my meal. I have had some pretty good escargot dishes in my day, usually swimming in a mild garlic butter sauce, however Metro's were doomed by a combination of rich green pesto and a breaded crust. If they had stuck with the pesto sauce it would have been great, the crusty breading just made it a little too complex. The poor little snail was overwhelmed.   A dinner companion started with a salad nicoise with poached egg. I had a bite and it was excellent. One of my favorite salads. I love the taste of the cool lettuce and dressing with just a hint of warm, rich egg yolk.   For my main course I had the roast chicken with mashed potatoes. It sounds simple but was anything but simple. The chicken was deconstructed, bones and skin removed, then the dark and white meats were put back together in a sort of roll, wrapped in the skin and roasted to perfection. I never order chicken at restaurants because it's usually so bland, but this was fantastic. Even better with the mashed potatoes and the small amount of mushroom & onion red wine reduction.  I could have used more of that sauce.   The service was good, our waiter definitely knew the menu well and he was attentive throughout the evening and patient when our party was indecisive.    And on a final note, I finished the night off with a Keoke Coffee. A family favorite.  Very flavorful, but the next day I had a horrendous hangover. I think the bartender was a little too generous with the brandy.  Not that I am complaining, just a word of caution.

The Mission bills itself as a modern Latin restaurant inspired by cuisines of Spain, Mexico, Central and South America utilizing French cooking techniques. What does this mean? Expect the unexpected. If you don't have the cojones to try something new, this may not be the place for you. Tip! - if you're not sure about something on the menu, ask plenty of questions, more on that later.   Despite arriving 10 minutes prior to my reserved time we were quickly seated and our server came right over to take our drink order. The house margarita's were good enough to make me vow to never again drink a margarita made from that premixed high fructose crap. I have officially kicked that habit.   The first course was a Peruvian clam stew, otherwise known as "Almejas Al Vapor". Incredible! Imagine the best soup de poisson you've ever had now add that to the best posole you've ever had and turn all that into a thick, creamy stew and voila! - you've got yourself one amazing dish. A perfect amount of spiciness, yet you don't even realize it because of all the other amazing flavors lurking within.   Second course was the chorizo porchetta with white bean puree. Basically, a very tender braised pork shoulder wrapped around a small piece of Mexican sausage. This dish was very good but not great, and I blame myself. The meat had a fairly strong smoky flavor which I personally don't care for. This might be due to the mesquite fired Plancha grill that I'm just not used to. However, I can see how others with an alternative palate would adore this dish. Again, this was my fault, I should have asked the server "what does it taste like" before ordering.   For desert I had the espresso churros with ibarra chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was great, the churros on the other hand were a bit overcooked, dare I say... charred. A good churro is crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the center. Granted, this will be very difficult for The Mission because their churros are very thin. For a churro of this size, there's probably a fine line between a limp piece of greasy dough or a brittle, black stick of coal.   After dinner the server brought each of us a shot of tequila. A nice gesture as she knew that it was a going away meal for my dinner companion who is moving to Texas.   As a whole, the experience at The Mission was excellent. Highly recommended.

Great Store. Perfect for the Scottsdalite that doesn't want to be bothered with actually having to interact with other human beings at a cash register. Everything is automated. I would have given this place five stars but the automated checkout system is not manufactured by Apple so its totally ghetto. Also, plenty of healthy choices are available for those of us who haven't had a carb in over 2 years. I am addicted to their store brand Brie.   In all seriousness, try their broccoli cheese soup. Fantastic. And there is a great pet store in this shopping center to check out if your in the neighborhood and want to buy your little pal a new toy.

Great atmosphere. The service was adequate despite the throngs of grey haired snowbirds and restless teenagers forced to text and pout while their parents got blitzed on sangria. The queso fundito was very good while the chicken enchiladas had a few "opportunity areas".   My advice for locals....order a $40+ pitcher of some fruity cocktail, sit back, relax and pretend you are on vacation.

Several years ago I was on Vacation with my family in France. For the hell of it, we decided on day one to identify the very best Creme Brulee in Paris. We ordered Creme Brulee after dinner, we ordered it after lunch, we even picked up a few Creme Brulee's at popular patisserie's throughout the city. Our Creme Brulee's would make their way around our table and we would discuss the merits of each. We analyzed those little euro custards as if we were trying to impress an eavesdropping Anthony Bourdain. Did we prefer it with or without vanilla beans? Warm or cold? Deep remekin or shallow? When it was all said and done, we found the best.   Believe it or not, we did the same thing in a little Mexican village called San Miguel de Allende. Only this time it wasn't Creme Brulee... it was Chilaquiles. When our trip was over I assumed that we found the best in San Miguel, possibly even the best in the world. I was wrong. Whatever we deemed superior in San Miguel was completely outmatched by the Chilaquiles I had last Friday evening at Gallo Blanco. Simply amazing. A perfect blend of savory, spicy chile with the faintest hint of citrusy sweetness. It had a wonderful contrast of various textures, and just enough crispiness on the top layer to make me forget the failed excessively soggy versions of my past.  And it was all topped off by two perfectly cooked eggs... sunny side up.  The service and atmosphere were also exceptional. I can't wait to go back.

Atmosphere - If the Pope decided to make a bootlegged version of the Cheesecake Factory and build it smack-dab in the middle of the Vatican you would have Brio Tuscan Grill. I know, I know, the Vatican is nowhere near Tuscany, but I think you get my point.    Service - Have you ever disturbed an anthill and watched the whole colony explode with activity? That's how Brio felt tonight. There were servers, bussers and ancillary staff hastily moving about, keeping everything in order.  Like a finely tuned machine, every angle was covered, every crumb quickly swept aside.  Did that teenager just windex my menu? Henry Ford would be proud, for apparently the US restaurant industry has become a quintessential assembly line operation. If the formula if followed, so too will profits.   Food - The food tastes great. Is that any surprise? Among other things, my entree contained the following ingredients... lobster, shrimp, fettucini, mushrooms, asparagus and heavy cream.  I am almost insulted they didn't throw bacon, truffles and a few sticks of butter in there. I love food and I was really hungry, so what I had for dinner at Brio would be the equivalent of giving an alcoholic a bottle of Louis XIII Cognac and asking if they like the taste of it.  Effin A yeah I liked it! What do you expect? There are some foods on this wondrous planet of ours that simply taste incredible regardless of the setting. I should have ordered the roast chicken so I would have a better idea of weather or not this place really knows how to cook. Oh, we also had the fried ravioli appetizer. Stuffed with ricotta resting on top of a very good marinara sauce. Don't even get me started.    Summary - Either way, what I had was very good, but it's nothing that you can't get from about a dozen other Italian chains out there.  It's like the macaroni grill but with larger portions, nicer bathrooms and a 30% price hike.  Next time I am starving, craving a rich, creamy pasta dish and I happen to be in the neighborhood I'll probably come here again.   And lastly, the red wine served at Brio is effective, as I am sure you can tell from the above review.

Yogurtland is my favorite froyo joint in the valley. They may not have the best toppings or widest variety but the yogurt itself simply tastes far better than the yogurt at competing businesses. I usually try 3-4 flavors at each visit and every time I am amazed at how rich and flavorful the yogurt is.   I tend to use far fewer toppings at yogurtland simply because the base is so good.   Also, I have a general expectation that businesses around college campuses look more like a disheveled  dorm room than modern european kitchen but Yogurtland does a great job of keeping this place neat and tidy. Something I didn't expect for a place right across the street from Sun Devil Stadium

Chowhound has produced a list of the 78 most annoying words to read in a restaurant review. I am well aware of this list and I know damn well the one word many readers would love to see at the top of that list is the word "unctuous". But I don't care. Unctuous is the only word that I could think of to describe the braised veal cheek I had at Petite Maison last night.  I would have given them 5 stars because of the great food and the charming atmosphere but I can't. It was too damn hot in there. It was 105 degrees all day so eating dinner in a warm dining room at 9pm wasn't an ideal situation. Maybe they are having some problems with their AC unit. I'll definitely be back..... after summer has passed.

Full disclosure - I am not a member and never have been. I tried this gym last week using a 3 day pass.   I will not be signing up.   This gym is extremely busy. It is very challenging to put in a good workout without waiting for the majority of my workout. I even found myself waiting around just for some extra space to stretch before lifting.  One afternoon there was an entire high school football team working out which I thought odd considering it was the 5pm rush hour.   On a positive note this gym might have the most attractive clientele that I have ever seen. It's on par with the Lifetime up near Scottsdale and the 101 only this gym's demographics are much younger. If I were 10 years younger I would probably join this gym just to walk around and socialize. Maybe get in a few sets in between fist bumps with the fellas. Fortunately I am wise enough to know that there are better places than the gym to socialize and better places than LA Fitness to work out.

One of my favorite books  is Michael Pollan's "Omnivore's Dilemma".  Pollan explains how humans have the rare luxury of being able to determine what to eat from a virtually limitless supply of options. Not only can we choose what foods to consume (meats, grains, veggies, dairy, etc...)  we can narrow down that decision to cuisines, preparation styles (raw, steamed, grilled, etc..), the food's source (local, industrial, pastoral) and if the food was scientifically altered somehow (molecular gastronomy, genetic engineering, hydrogenation, etc..)  Choices, choices, choices!  While I love food, sometimes I just don't want to think about it anymore. I want to let the professionals take over. The good people over at FnB are the pro's I have been looking for. I had dinner there last Saturday night. I could break it all down for you and describe each dish, but I want this review to focus on the general concept of placing your trust in a restauranteur. While I have only been once, I now trust that FnB will serve fresh, local produce. I trust that the menu is simple and seasonal. I trust that I am not a mere piggy bank funding their next concept restaurant. I trust that the chef will produce really good food without cutting corners by adding excess amounts of salt, butter, cream or sugar (don't insult my palate's intelligence). And I trust that members of the kitchen staff get paid more than the decorators or "ambiance engineers".  I trust FnB to follow through for me so I have no regrets.  I'm definitely going back soon. In fact, what the hell.... I'm going back next weekend. Hope to see you there.

What a fantastic neighborhood restaurant. The type of place that makes me want to move to old town.  And such a great Saturday night crowd! A perfect demographic mashup that felt more like Santa Barbara than Arizona.  For dinner I ordered the panini with prosciutto and caramelized onions. It was very tasty but arrived at our table a little too cold. My butternut squash soup on the other hand was piping hot and excellent. Just right for a chilly January evening.   Unfortunately I was a little under the weather on this particular evening so I couldn't drink any of the wine but I am feeling better now and look forward to returning and getting a nice red wine buzz started.

Please refer to my attached photo for why the Scottsdale Quarter gets ONE star for my review. HALF of the entire parking garage was reserved for Valet parking on a Tuesday night at 8:00pm.  And all the spots were empty. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind parking far away and walking or even parking valet, but I was just "stopping in" to grab some froyo at Menchies. The walk to and from my car took longer than it took me to get the Frozen Yogurt.    What's the point of having a parking garage if it's completely empty and reserved for valet parking?   Its no wonder the Oakville Grocery closed, there was probably nowhere for the customers to park.  I wouldn't be surprised if other businesses close as a result of this horrendous parking situation.

Personally, I am never going back to Lush Burger. Rather than try to convince you to follow my lead, allow me to simply recount my recent lunch experience and you can decide for yourself.   I was reading the "Scottsdale Airpark News" the other day and noticed a coupon for a $10 lunch combo special. This special is also published on Lush Burger's profile page in the iPhone yelp app . The special included a classic "Lush Burger", a side of fries, and a fountain drink.   I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender asked if I wanted a menu, and I told him that it wasn't necessary as I have already decided to get the $10 lunch special. He asked me what type of fries I would like and proceeded to list them, "regular, sweet potato or truffle fries"? I asked for the truffle fries. The food was very good. The truffle fries not quite as good as Zinc Bistro's but still fairly tasty. The Burger was fantastic, cooked perfectly (medium) with a nice mild sauce and fresh, crisp vegetables.    Then the bill came.... $13.44. As usual at restaurants, there were three slips in the bill so I looked at the itemized version...   Lunch Combo Special - $12.00  Tax - $1.44  Total - $13.44    Now the moment of truth, do I ask about this at risk of feeling cheap or do I just pay it and leave considering the hamburger was so good. On principal, I asked the bartender about the $2 difference. Rather than apologize, he began to explain that their computer sometimes does that, and then he asked "you had the truffle fries right?" I said "yes, that was one of the options you gave me after I told you I wanted the special". He thought about it for a moment and explained how he was going to try and work it out on the computer. He came back, dropped off a single (non-itemized) slip for $11.44 and hastily made his way all the way over to the other side of the bar and began slicing lemons. Another moment of truth... Should I ask about it, or just leave? I decided to ask. Rather than walk over to me he just nodded from across the way to see what I wanted. "What's the $1.44 for?" I asked loud enough so he could hear me over there... "Tax" he curtly replied. At this point I decided just to pay and leave.    What really bothers me is now I am the one who is going to feel guilty all afternoon for getting so worked up over a measly two dollars and change. How silly of me to think that lunch on a beautiful Friday afternoon should be a pleasant experience.   In case you were wondering, according to the "internet", sales tax in AZ is around 7% and Scottsdale adds another 1.65% on top of that. So I don't really know where that other 6% "tax" came from (on that extra $1.44). He probably just subtracted $2 from my original bill, or maybe restaurants have some other tax obligations that I am missing but I smell something fishy in this burger joint.

1) The wait staff all wear silly costumes  2) Our entrees came out before the appetizers which was totally bizarre.   3) The apps were dropped off at the table before we finished the entrees.   4) The food was OK but not worth what we paid.   5) They comp'd the second round of sangrias due to the kitchen mixup so that was nice.   6) Great location, right on the waterfront.   7) Cheesy decor.  Felt like a chain.

Great dog park. Lot's of friendly dogs and owners. I sometimes go early in the morning before the energy level of the park gets too high for my new rescue Joey.  As a new family member, my dog needs training and some work on her social skills, and the regulars at Horizon have all been very patient with us.   The afternoons can get a bit rowdy, but if you completely trust your dog it's safe to assume that your pup will be safe here.

If I ever get married I am going to make sure my wife and I eat at True Food at least 7 times a week. This will ensure that my wife maintains her incredible hotness while I get to eat flavorful food at least once a day. Win win.

This is my new favorite store for workout attire.  Not only are the materials of the highest quality (they have made it through several washes and still look brand new) but everything fits perfectly. At 6'5" 200lbs I have a hard time finding clothes that fit. Particularly long sleeve shirts with sleeves long enough at the arms without being too baggy around the waist.   And the staff here are incredible helpful. I felt like I had my own personal shopping assistant trying her best to ensure I found just the right items.    The only downside is that everything is expensive. On the flipside the clothes seem very durable. I have a hunch I may end up saving money in the long run.   And lastly - they actually have size 14 socks. And the most comfortable socks I have ever worn. Amazing!

Some friends and I went to Narcisse last Saturday night.  The cocktail I was holding was a little cold and my arm was getting tired from holding the drink at a certain angle to maximize the coolness factor so I decided to set the drink down on this little ledge above a white leather couch. At that particular moment I made a mental calculation that my drink had at least 51% of it's weight on the intended surface. It did not take long before my hypothesis proved incorrect because it turned out that a larger portion of my drinks weight was resting on nothing other than fresh Arizona air. The glass tipped over and began to spill my rum and diet all over the beautiful white couch. I used my Jedi reflexes (that ironically failed me a moment ago) to catch the glass before it could fall towards the floor and possibly shatter. None the less, most of my drink ended up spilling all f'ing over the place.  Within seconds a security guard was at my side with a tiny flashlight directing other members of the staff to begin cleaning everything up. I apologized for being so clumsy and assured him I would try much harder in the future to stop causing trouble.  He explained how it was no problem and it happens all the time. I thought this was great customer service. I will definitely be back to spend more money and finish each drink.

Simply fantastic all the way around. Incredible service backed up by innovative food and drink ideas. I have had shrimp and grits before (a favorite on Bravo's Top Chef). Citizen Public house simply substituted scallops for the shrimp and it turned out great. For desert I had milk and cookies. No kidding.  I've not had milk and cookies since I was a kid, and it was all that I remembered it to be. The cookies were an assortment of gourmet locally made gems so whatever type of cookie you remember from your childhood, it's probably represented here.  Some soft, some a bit on the hard side, which needed a little longer soak.   There are some great new cocktail ideas on the bar menu as well as some old classics that they manage to pull off quite well. All in all, CPH is a great restaurant.

When I think back to my past lunches at Asian Island the first word that comes to mind is "value".   The second word would be "kuàisù" which is Chinese for "this was a good meal that didn't take long and they have a soda fountain with free refills and each table has a bottle of sriracha which is also pretty cool"

Five stars for the stadium. Amazing views of the Mountains, great sight lines to the field from just about everywhere, and an extra large outfield  berm for plenty of roomy lawn seating. And the new home to my two favorite baseball teams less than 5 minutes from my house. I couldn't be more pleased with the Stadium.   The Team Shop on the other hand - One Star!!! I have one question for whoever bought the merchandise for the team shop. Can you please get a freakin rockies game cap?! Seriously, you are the ROCKIES TEAM SHOP and you don't have one game ready black baseball hat with the Rockies logo???? And why do you have hundreds of purple jungle pattern john deer mesh Rockies hats? Is there a rush of douchey baseball fans that you were expecting the day I showed up???  SERIOUSLY!! OK my vent is over, I guess I'll have to order my new cap online.

The new Stingray location at Scottsdale Quarter makes a nice addition to the growing restaurant scene in North Scottsdale. Entire walls slide open in the bar area to bring the outdoors in. The decor is very sophisticated and the whole place is extremely clean (one of the benefits of being 2 weeks old). I had a nice lunch here today.  As usual, I had the lunch sashimi combination. At $15 the sashimi combo at Stingray is $2 more than the same dish at RA (across the street in Kierland), however the Stingray combo had a side cucumber salad and the miso soup here was more rich and flavorful than the miso at RA. Although they are very close, RA seems to provide more fish but I like how Stingray's slices are a bit shorter and thicker than the slices at RA making the fish more manageable with chopsticks.   I also like how the bar at Stingray is very deep front to back. I felt like I had more room for my elbows, iPhone, book, sunglases, etc... and didn't feel like I was right on top of the bartender as she sliced lemons. The service was adequate and friendly. I would come here again.

Nice lounge, good views and neat menus. The service had high points and low points. Upon walking in and wandering around looking for a place to sit down a waitress approached us and offered to help find our group a place to sit down and relax. Within 5 minutes she had a large seating area cleaned and ready for us. The low point was when I ordered a vodka martini on the rocks with a twist but got a regular martini, in a martini glass, with an olive.  I thought that was a bit odd for a high end lounge but maybe I should just learn to order more popular drinks in the future.    Full disclosure - I am rooting for these waterfront places to succeed. It has been a tough few years and I admire the business owners who keep putting these places out there hoping that one day their venture on Southbridge will make it for the long haul.
