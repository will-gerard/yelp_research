Very disappointed with my first visit here. The guys at the door were cocky. Our waitress was not helpful at all. My friend and I both ordered margaritas. After ordering, our waitress disappeared. Our drinks were the worst and expensive. We tried explaining to our server that we weren't satisfied and she showed no remorse. I don't plan on returning to Sandbar Desert Ridge again.

After being an avid fan of Four Peaks for so long, I was at first skeptical about O.H.S.O. However, it has won my heart! It is now one of my all time favorite places to go to take a buddy and hang out for a while.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  I love the Arizona Burger! I can eat cream cheese and poblano aoili from the burger with just a spoon!  The brunch specials are amazing as well. Where else can you grab a beer and a tasty filling meal for 10 bucks?  It also helps I can get my favorite beers here- Almost all Four Peaks taps, Papago Brewing Orange Blossom, and Sonoran Brewing White Chocolate Ale! So kudos to you, O.H.S.O! Keep up the great work! I also look forward to your new restaurant.

My husband and I headed to Songbird last First Friday Art Walk. It sure made a lasting impression on both of us! That is saying a lot because my husband tends to not get excited about coffee houses. I had a Hot Spiced Chai Tea Latte and it was the best Chai I have ever had! He had the Hot Chocolate. It was busy but they maintain the line very well! Our drinks were served the perfect drinking temperature too! We don't live very close to downtown, but we are definitely going to make an effort to frequent Songbird whenever we can. Thank you, Songbird!

I went to Vovomeena for the first time today and loved it. I had the Banging Pocket which has Schreiner's banger sausage, scrambled eggs, and smoked gouda in pita bread. It was phenomenal! All of the ingredients taste so fresh. Loved the home-style goodness!  I also had a cafe latte with vanilla. Simple but delicious.  The setup up is very modern and practical. Nice looking art on the walls. The staff was polite and friendly. The bathrooms were also very clean!  I will definitely be going back when I'm on this side of town.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our first experience at Pho Viet today. For starters, our waitress was so friendly she made us immediately feel comfortable. We were both able to get the 10 dollar combo special, which comes with a bowl of Pho, a  spring roll or egg roll, and a drink. The spring rolls were so fresh, the best I've had anywhere. I ordered number 31, Pho Ga, which is Pho soup with tender chicken. The broth was so tasty, seasoned perfectly. My husband got number 30 Pho Tom, PHO soup with premium shrimp. It had so many pieces of actual shrimp, we were both so surprised!  We will definitely be going back soon!

What an amazing Thai place! The staff was friendly both on the phone and in person. Service was quick! The cleanliness of the restaurant was supberb. My dad, husband, and I each had different curries and they were all perfectly savory. Portions are decently sized.  We've tried several different Thai restaurants in the area. This is by far our favorite and the others can't even compete. We really hope Krachai is able to gain a good clientele.
