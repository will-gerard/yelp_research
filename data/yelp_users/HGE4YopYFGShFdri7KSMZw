Huge rooms. Soft towels. Comfortable bed with tons of pillows.   Three things that make me happy when I'm traveling.    What's wrong with this place, then? First of all, the location is central to nothing aside from the mall which houses several chain restaurants.  Second, the staff could not care less about pretty much anything. While the woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly, that was the end of that. Despite requesting my Hilton status "amenities" (just a package of snacks and water...not much), I never received it.  I was also charged $30 for internet when I shouldn't have paid a thing (got the bill corrected at check out). And housekeeping didn't leave enough towels or replace the water.    Considering we paid over $200 a night, the blase attitude of the staff is very disappointing.

Three words: THAI. TUNA. ROLL. Get it. You won't be disappointed.    In addition, the California and the Mango Salmon Rolls were quite good as well.  While Arizona isn't a place known for stand-out sushi, I'd order it here again.  And in fact I did...two nights in a row.   Night #1 - The bartender was a superb professional. He replaced drink napkins when they were damp and even poured my martini into a fresh cold glass when I was half-way done.  Class act.  He was also the one who recommended the Thai Tuna Roll which adds even more points to his score, if possible.    Night #2 - CRANKY bartender. While she recommended a nice glass of white wine, she poured me a totally different one the second time.  While it was St Patrick's Day, it's not like this place was packed out with annoying patrons so I'm not sure what put her in such a bad place. It did leave me with a not-so-happy feeling when I left, despite the fact that the food was just as good as the first go-around.    So, what could be the only gripes aside from the attitude?   * You will pay a chunk of change for your meal here (but it will likely be worth it)  * You will also likely order something that they're out of (mango salmon roll the first night, grilled artichoke the second night, and every night I've ever gone to a Hillstone, for that matter) * It's a chain  Bottom line is that Hillstone is probably one of the better options in this neck of the woods.  Go for a cocktail and a Thai Tuna Roll, if nothing else.

Best facial I've ever had. My skin, days later, is still looking the best it has in years.  The massage was good, not great.  Plentiful amenities, though I didn't stick around to use them.   50 min facial and 50 min massage was $180 (plus service fee) which was the best deal we found in all of Vegas.  Well worth the cab ride over to this side of town.

This place is spotless, has a great bottled beer selection, and has outdoor and rooftop patio space.    I enjoyed a pre-spring training game Anchor Steam here on St Patrick's Day and was pleasantly surprised to find a place to stand outdoors, a friendly dog running around, a lack of douchey customers, friendly service, and a cleaner than clean bathroom.  SCORE.

I don't really like Vegas...but I liked The Cosmopolitan.   The good:  The lobby is stunning with amazing changing visuals on large pillars.   Fountain view suites are amazing...views, appointments, etc. Beds are super comfortable.  Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  Casino is classy.  Marquee is right in your hotel.  Location can't be beat.   Unfortunately, The Cosmopolitan is not perfect... Minimal towels. I expect more than two in a one bedroom suite.  One bathrobe. I'm going to venture a guess that there's usually more than one person staying in a suite.  Our room was not available when we arrived. Apparently, they cannot guarantee your room...ever? We had to stay in a standard room on the first night, then pack up our stuff, bring it down to the bell desk, and wait 4 hours for our originally booked suite to be ready. For a hotel of this level, I'd have expected someone to at least arrange for pick up of our luggage and delivery to a new room. That's said, we were given a food/drink credit that helped the frustration slightly.  Come 4am, the lobby bar is prostitution central. I've been to Vegas plenty of times and seen my fair share of prostitutes but the Cosmo was different.  A swarm of prostitutes and their pimps invaded the lobby bar. It was so in your face that it was uncomfortable. The four pimps actually had a roster/check list to keep track of who was taken and who wasn't. I'd expect this type of thing to be a little lower key than what we saw...t just seemed super classless.  I mean, a hooker checklist? Come on.   All that said, I still rank the Cosmo in at 4 stars, relative to other options on the strip.  They could use a few improvements but overall, worth the money.

Fan-freaking-tastic shrimp tacos + Modella Especial in a bottle (serviced with an icy pint glass) + good (free) chips and salsa = a VERY happy Meghan M.    Happy hour specials looked great but just enjoying lunch on the patio was a perfect start to a few days in Phoenix.
