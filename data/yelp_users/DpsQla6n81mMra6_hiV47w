I trust no other car care center with the cleaning of my car but Los Olivos.  The staff is always courteous and because they hand wash your car, I don't have to worry about scratches on my paint job. I've been coming here for at least 2 years and have always been satisfied.

I live downtown and often visit BC. Today I received the worst service since coming here. My friends and I frequent this place often and usually have a really good experience.   Today we arrived and and had to wait longer then expected to be seated. we then noticed that people that arrived after us were being sat before us. No problem mistakes happen. However, when we brought it to hostess attention we recieved attitude and no apology. Then we ordered drinks as we usually do. They got the drink orders wrong and again we were greeted with attitude.  I am huge on customer service and therefore will not be returning to BC.

Great ambiance... DJ during brunch hours is an added bonus.  Great food presentation. My only complaint is the men's room lacks privacy from the beer garden. If you're standing at the urinal and the door flings open folks may see your sunshine!
