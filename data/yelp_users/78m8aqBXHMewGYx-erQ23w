Terrible customer service!  Saw their store on the money mailer iphone app ... Went in to get my nails done ... The guy said he would rather turn down my business then take the online app money mailer / passport coupon I showed him existed!  He said absolutely no ... I needed the paper coupon.  First of all ... Don't offer the electronic app if you're not going to honor.  I told him I didn't live close.  He didn't care.  Said to come back with a piece of paper!    I won't be coming here again that's for sure!

Scott and his coworker were amazing!  My car looks so beautiful :)   I haven't seen it look this good since the day I bought it and I actually think it looks better than that day.  My car was filthy ... and they made it look so sparkly.  He's very professional and friendly.  I would recommend him in a heart beat.  Engine / Leather / Radio ... everything looked great.  Amazing Job!!!!

San Tool Pool is awesome!  Lucky to have found such a great local company to help us service our pool every month.  We have peace of mind knowing that our pool is clean and free of any debris every time they come over.  We've had a few problems with our pool and they've been quick to respond and help us getting our issues resolved promptly.  The owners seem to be very involved with their company and if you have any concerns they are quick to help out in any way.  All the people that have come to my home to my home have been very professional and courteous.  Have really appreciated their pool service.  Great work!

Very disappointed!!  When I first spoke with Davonna I was excited and was already planning on giving her a big tip because she seemed very professional and sweet.  Unfortunately that is where the professionalism ended.  I called to advise that I may show up a couple minutes late after a hectic day and was greeted with attitude from the get go.  I was hoping for a relaxing experience and realized maybe I would just get the hour from the time I was scheduled for but was cut short of even that.  The lecture I received on etiquette also ruined any opportunity for the relaxation that is advertised in the description.  I also was not impressed with the actual massage but that may be attributed to many factors including the stress that was added when I arrived.  If you do decide to go please make sure to show up 10 minutes early if it is your first time because it will only be on the bottom of the invite you will receive and will lead to the dissertation on your lack of professionalism as a client.  As I started with, all I can say is that I am very disappointed...

I'm very glad to hear that my review has prompted the masseuse to make some changes in her etiquette.  I'm sure the other reviews were edited to offset my first review.  But as you can see she never addressed my issues ... only said that all her other reviews were filtered.  I still stand by my first review whole heartedly.  Maybe she had a bad day ... I guess all people do.  But, i asked her if she wanted to reschedule ... she said i could, but i would be charged a no show.  Hence, the start of my bad review.  However, her filtered reviews do show very positive feedback which I commend.

Just had my a/c go out yesterday afternoon, and was sent someone this morning to fix.  Amazing job!  Prompt and courteous!  Will definitely be recommending Sure Temp Air Conditioning to others.  With AZ summers it's hard to know who to call that you can trust and will be reliable.  So thankful to have been myself recommended to this great business!  Highly recommended!
