Good service and food. Was surprised by other reviews. Server was Cody, who was attentive and knowledgable. The food was served fresh and hot in a timely manner.

This place had a menu in the hotel where I was staying.  The hotel is next to the restaurant.  The menu heavily focused on delivery to the hotel and the ability to charge it to your room account.  I called and they seemed not to know anything about it.  Spoke with four people and ended up with a manger.  He told me cash only or 20% surcharge for delivery.  This additional charge should have been mentioned on the menu.  Clearly a scam by the restaurant.  I spoke with the hotel and they were not aware of a surcharge.  I'm giving this place a single star for unethical business practices.  They deserve zero stars.

Outstanding service by Chase. Truly exception for our group of six adults and 2 tired kids.   The atmosphere is comfortable and food was tasty, as always at Brio. We had the Gorgonzola beef medallions, 5oz filet, pasta far diabolical with chicken and chicken Milanese. Several substitutions (fries for mashed, etc) and no problems at all.   Service was quick and friendly. Food was hot. Overall a great experience for a family on vacation. It was my sister in law's birthday and it was the perfect place for a nice evening. The free app with Yelp check in is also a nice perk.   With the free app, Chase made several recommendations and adjusted it to our needs. We ended up with the bruschetta sampler with 4 steak and 4 roasted red pepper. Omitting the ones with bacon.   I highly recommend this location.
