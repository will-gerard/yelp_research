I went here on Friday night with a friend. They let vets in free which was a plus, but we walked in and I went to the bar to order a beer and the bartender was having some deep conversation with a client and honestly took 4 min to pour two draft beers.... The entire bar had THREE customers including the two of us. After a long wait for our beer we went into the the entertainment area and sat down. I think there was only three dancers there on a Friday night which I thought that was unusual. Then after two dancers did their "set" they needed to take a break where there was a 10 min time period where the stage was empty. When the next dancer came to the stage she was a plus size girl (just not my thing) and the DJ said "remember gents the dancers don't get paid from the club, they only make money from tips".  Desert Flame is a sorry excuse for a strip club for any third world country and I can't wait until they close their doors and it becomes another used car dealership.  I wouldn't go back if they offered free VIP dances for an entire weekend with their best dancers.  I'm disappointed that I spent $5 on a beer and couldn't drink more than 1/2 before needing to leave.

If i could give KILO GUNS LLC a 10 star review I would. Not only is the owner a Combat Vet (USMC) he was willing to talk to me on the phone over the little details of my weapon. Kilo Guns does quality work at fair prices, not to mention the crazy awesome designs they do. I will be returning to Kilo Guns as soon as I can for a new "toy".
