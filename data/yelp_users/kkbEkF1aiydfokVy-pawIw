Best pizza in the valley. Get there early if you want a seat this place fills up fast.

Came with the family for some boneless wings - sweet girl sat us quickly and got the high chair - and then we sat with no help . The restaurant wasn't even half full - 10 min went by and each waitress looked at us from their bar hang out and walked right on by - finally when the table on our left had to stand up and flag down a waitress for another beer we decided it wasn't worth staying and we left - some of the poorest service I've seen in awhile.
