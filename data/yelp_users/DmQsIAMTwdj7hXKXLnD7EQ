You know that sweet idiom about so-and-so's behind being as large as Texas? Well! They must have had the chicken fried steak. AKA atherosclerosis for your dining pleasure.   Pretty sure those kitschy armadillos plastering the walls are a fire hazard.  I like it!

Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again.   I asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem.   What she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee...   How much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time.   Also, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip.   All in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee. And frankly, I never want to put that stuff in my mouth again. I don't see what this place has to offer.

I LOVE the look of Tammie Coe's vibrantly colored fondant masterpieces. I LOVE the ooey gooey icing. I LOVE the moistness in the red velvet cupcake.  HERE'S WHAT I REALLY, REALLY DON'T LIKE:  I had a Zebra cake for my 22nd birthday from LGO made by Tammie Coe. I was pleased with the whole shebang. For my graduation from nursing school, my mom decided to order me a specially made cake from Tammie Coe's. She requested "jewel tone" colors; emerald green, deep blueberry purple, and a garnet like color. The lady who helped her was rude, cold, and short. She told her to "remember that this is fondant, and those aren't jewel tones, jewels don't come in those colors." My mom just urged that they make sure they are rich, deep colors because those are my daughters favorites. Welp, I picked up a lime green, hot pink, and baby lavendar cake.  AND AS IF THAT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH:  My mom paid extra to have a stethoscope and graduation cap placed on top of the cake. There were obvious thumb prints all over the stethoscope and the silver from the stethoscope was smeared all over the top of the cake. When I got home I took out my painter's brushes, cleaned off a fan brush, and then meticulously cleaned up their mess with water and patience. As they should have done.  For the price, I'd expect the Tammie Coe staff to be respectful and courteous to all of their customers, but especially to my mother. Furthermore, the work should not be sloppy and the color should be what was ordered.   Tammie Coe did not deliver.

Before nursing school, I used to have pampered nails. Now I bite them before tests, break them opening pill bottles, and hold the polish as a means of infection control.  The minute my semester was over, I went for a mani/pedi. I feel ASLEEP in the massage chair. (Thankfully it was later in the day and not that many people were there to witness this)  So, I've been coming to see Mei here at Paradise Nails off and on for around 5 years. She just went ahead and let me sleep, she figured I needed it. I figure they need 5 stars.  Oh, and you'd never know I'm in nursing by looking at my hands now. Bam!

I've been to Farrelli's a handful of times now. I've come to conclude that the concept is fanciful, but the execution is mediocre.   5 Pros:  -the art deco doors, gorgeous!  -Hollywood glam posters on the wall  -you push a button on your coaster, it lights up, then over pops the waiter with your refill  -you can have a drink at the lounge while you wait for your film  -there's an email listserv and you can get hooked up with deals   5 Cons:  -the food isn't great, (IT'S AWFUL) tastes mass produced and bland  -too expensive  -slow service in the theater, rude service upfront  -you get graced with "smoooooth jazz" before the film starts, yeah no really.  -if you're not on a date here, you'll feel like you should be

The husband, wife and son team who own gold bar are absolutely lovely, lovely people. That goes for the rest of the staff too. They remember you! Even when you make a trip back from a three month long hiatus.   All those GIANT pastries are homemade by the wife. They're damn good. (The holiday sugar cookies are extremely popular. And pretty.)   Each table has a lamp and there are plenty of outlets (it kind of looks like a fire hazard, but hey that's okay!) So, it's a great study spot in the afternoon, before it gets over populated.   The staff knows their way around the menu and they also offer to make you something else if you don't like their suggestion. I've always liked their suggestions. :)  You can leave your punch card there in an alphabetically sorted bin, which is convenient if you tend to loose those things like me.   The downside is the bathroom. It's a little bit awkwardly placed. You have to work your way through the "kitchen area" to get to it.   OH! BONUS! I used to take my weiner dog here. The baristas would always have treats for him. He really likes gold bar too.

Um, I always end up feeling like I should recommit myself to fitting into those skinny jeans every time I see the scene at Green. And it is a scene.  But then I'm also compelled to order those Thyme fries with my veggie burger. What's a girl to do?  Good food :)

Completely, utterly, undoubtedly, a few more imploring adjectives - worth the hype.  GO.

Good god lux is good!! When I need a glucose fix I get the velvet, and for the love of sweet baby jesus don't forget the dollop of whipped cream. mmm. It's heaven in a spoonful. Otherwise, sign me up for the iced coffee with the two shots of espresso that come along with, hells yes I'm set.   But you know all those quotes? the ones to the right of the menu?...last time i checked we had this wondrous beauty on display:   "Today will be tied to something  like a bed post wrapping  tree stumps in table clothes  to set the table for supper"    So, THIS is what makes Lux even better! It's that quote and all its precedents and all of its subsequent replacements.   Jeff, the owner of lux and a poet, he's the man responsible for each and every one of those quotes. Simply an extra lovely touch in my humble opinion.  Alsooooooo Pastries = YES!

The first time I went to conspire I got the Thai wrap, some funky name drew me to it. It was decent, but not great. The coffee I used to wash it down was strong and I appreciated that. However,  the service took forever (35minutes to wrap vgetables in a wrap and throw some Thai sauce on it? wtf?) even though I was the only customer in sight.   A previous yelper had the perfect word to describe the look of the place, "gritty." And I mean there's grit everywhere. The place is dirty and gross and I hope the health inspector pays a visit soon because I'm concerned for peoples' health.  Despite my less than stellar first try at Conspire, I gave it a second go because I park next to it everyday to walk to ASU downtown. I thought I might as well have a place to grab a convenience lunch on days I'm running late (hindsight is everything!). Second time round I got the undead burger. Now, now I will never go back! This time the burger took 45 minutes to make and I was once again the only customer in the place. When I finally got it the entire bottom bun was soaked in the oil that was used to cook the burger. The burger itself squirted oil up my nose when I bit into it. At the same time mayo flew out the other end and  plopped onto the ground when I took that fateful bite. I threw it in the next dumpster I happened by.  After this last experience I'll now call the food gross in addition to the actual physical site. Never, ever again!

My friend moved to NYC and asked me could I pretty please send him some Cartel because it's almost Iced Toddy weather.   LET ME REPEAT: My friend is making me ship him Cartel coffee to NYC (of all places) because he misses it that much.   As for the scene; It's scenester to the extreme. I'd never want to study here. Grab and go.

NoRTH has that standard sleek/sexy/urban/whatever leitmotif of FOX Restaurant Concepts.   I mean gone are the fruit chunks you see in typical sangria. Instead, there's a pureed sweet confection that's a bit too niminy priminy. But I can't find too much fault in it tastes wise.   The bruschetta was topped with asparagus and prosciutto. I was afraid the cheese would melt the bread out of sight. Ohs and ahs of satisfaction worthy. Best part of the meal hands down.   The pizza we ordered was scanty with the prosciutto and heartiest on the fig.  Therefore, yeah I like this place, but it's not what I'd call "Modern Italian Cuisine". Don't kid yourself.

I went to my mothership, aka the Burton Barr. I was about to head home when I discovered Giant, on their 1 year anniversary no less! They were giving away FREE 12oz COFFEEs. (So, you know this review was bribed.) I went for the honey vanilla latte (I remembered yelpers yelping about it.) Sure thing, I agree! Mmm, mmm very good.  Um, the weird thing about Giant is despite its name, it's pretty easy to miss. (I mean I'd never seen it before in all my days) So, if you're planning to go, look for the CVS across the street. Park your car over there too. There's parking in the back of Giant, but it's limited and you can't really keep your eye on your vehicle. And, well, you may want that ability.   Oh, cute boutique attached too!

So um we really, really wanted some Swedish meatballs one day. Then low and behold we landed at Beaver Choice. Best. Accident. Ever.  This is a family owned business. We were the only guests. The Scandianvian son fawned on us. We had to sample EVERYTHING. I mean we had two heaping full plates of samples, before we were allowed to order. He insisted! It was so amazingly awkward.   Truly though, very gracious people. It's a gem of a place.

No need to sneak in your liquor to camelview 5. You can just go to filmbar! Pick from artsy independent films and an extensive "snotty" beer list. Then you're good to go.  Intimate feel too. When seated in the lounge, you'll have to lean in real close to hear your date. That's great, sometimes.  The Indian style paintings on the walls were done in exchange for plane tickets. The artist went to town on the walls, then he went to India with his girlfriend. Isn't that awesome?!  I like places with stories. This place has them, galore. Give it a try!

I wanted to wander around "La Grande Orange", but of course the parking lot was full. I drove around and found this treasure instead. Outside it looks like a little cottage (with cat claw climbing up one side of it! tres magnifique!) with quaint french white and blue furniture for a coffee on the patio. There actually was a table of Frenchmen doing such on my second visit!   Inside the tables have bright flowers in little vases. (see attached photo) Annnnnd there was a chalk elephant and monkey on the floor! Art house oils on the walls enhance the aesthetics. It just has this simple and wonderful charm.   There were whole fresh strawberries embedded in my muffin. So goooood. It had those flaky crumbles on the top too. In front of the pastries are little placards. They have descriptives like "elegant" or "scrumptious". The owner smiled and said his girlfriend is in PR and she's responsible for that. I thought it was beyond endearing.   The owner, in fact, is really amiable. He asked my friend and me if we'd like to see the patio. It's not ready yet for sitting... But! He plans to paint it "terracotta like", plant some bougainvillea, buy some hotel valley ho inspired umbrellas, plus misters for the summertime. I absolutely cannot wait.   Oh! The Iced Toddy was pretty damn good. It had complex nutty and chocolate undertones.   Right now the place is only open from 6AM-3PM. But I think it's going to blow up soon and have to extend its hours.

Yup, a great living social find. Kim's enthusiastic and welcoming. Plus, her barre class left me a good kind of sore. And the candlelight yoga was a perfect destresser for the mid-week crazies.  I know Kim's got plans to take over the place next door.. knocking down some walls and expanding! With the popularity she's found I wouldn't doubt it all coming to fruition sooner than expected. But even if this place grows in physical dimension, it's going to keep that initimate feel. At this studio you're greeted by name and with a warm smile. I'm sold.
