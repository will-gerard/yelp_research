REAL food (not the processed crap you find at Denny's).  Super friendly and fast service.  Family owned and operated.  Local ingredients  Great portions.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, maybe a few more tables to shorten the wait.  But that's all part of the charm!  This is my pick for the best breakfast in Phoenix!  SOOOOO delicious!!

Worst.  Venue.  Ever.  The one star is for the great music that they book.  Too bad I won't be seeing any more great bands there until they fix some of the problems.  Starting with.....AIR-CONDITIONING!  It was the hottest weekend Phoenix has had yet this year with temps hitting 105 and higher.  And they had no A/C on.  Yes, I'm serious.  My friends and I could barely stand still comfortably much less dance.  Walking back out into 100 degree air never felt so good.  Oh, but they do have plenty of fans!  But most of the fans are broken and not running anyway.  Awesome.  Next, THE BAR.  It doesn't take my service industry experience to know that 2 bartenders for 500 people isn't enough.  Even if some of them are under age and not drinking.  Actually getting to the bar to order a drink took over 20 hot and sweaty minutes.  Then instead of a vodka soda I got a vodka red bull.  ?!?!?  How do those even sound the same?  But instead of waiting another 20 minutes to get this corrected I just drank the damn thing.   The incorrect drink wouldn't have ben SO bad if I would have been charged correctly for it.  But nope, instead of paying for one I got to pay for two!  Even better!  I can't put all the blame on the bartenders for this, they were pretty busy taking care of the other 300 plus drinkers.  Mistakes happen, I know.  But when they do, they need to be corrected.  So when I called the next day to ask for this to be fixed I didn't think it would be too much trouble to have the amount adjusted or at least the promise of a free drink at the next show.  Well, there an't never gonna be a next show.  Cause when I finally spoke with the owner I was called a name and then HUNG UP ON.  BY THE OWNER.  I hope my favorite bands start playing at The Rhythm Room because this was my first and last show at The Clubhouse.

Oh Luci's.  I really wanted to love you!  Sadly, I cannot.  When you see 'Healthy Marketplace"  there is a certain level of expectation that comes along with that.  Upon first glance at the menu it's pretty obvious that most of it isn't healthy what so ever.  Where are the fresh salads?  How about some quinoa or beets?  Whole wheat pasta?   How about something made with fresh, local ingredients?  I tried a veggie wrap of some kind and it was ok.  Not memorable at all.  And everything is prepared in this tiny 'kitchen'.  It looks more like a demo kitchen!  How can you truly create amazing food if you have no space to do it? All in all, Luci's is a big disappointment in my book.
