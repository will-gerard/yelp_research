I grew up on Pat's Pizza and I can't think of anything else I would have rather eaten for the past 20 years.  Yes, the staff is not usually too friendly, yes, there are signs everywhere telling you what you can and can't do, and yes, they don't like it when you use a debit card.  However, none of that matters once you take a bite of their heavenly NY style pizza.  The smattering of sauce is bright red against the perfectly thin, white crust, and the cheese is loaded with herbs and toppings.  It's not too sweet and not too doughy.  It's consistent and mouthwateringly delicious.  PLUS, you can bring your own beer and get too drunk to even see the 1,000 signs bossing you around.  I used to live right down the street from Pat's, but now, sadly, I have to drive 22 miles once a month just to get my fix.  It doesn't matter... I'd drive 500 miles for a slice of Pat's.

I'm almost reluctant to even write a review for Magen because I don't want everyone to start going there.  I know, I'm selfish, but I just love this place so much and will NEVER go to another nail salon.  The people working there are BEYOND friendly and always bend over backwards for me and my friends when we go in.  They will make sure that we have pillows, water, and can sit by each other to chat.  I have even had one of the ladies paint my nails while I was getting a pedicure because she didn't want me to have to get up.  They have hot stones for your massage and they don't skimp on the time.  I think my last foot massage there was close to 10 minutes.  They have great prices and awesome service.  The only thing that would make this place better would be a glass of wine!

I went to Grazie for Valentine's day, which can often be a difficult time to be a vegetarian (with all the prixe fixe menus full of the romantically dead lobsters and cows).  My boyfriend had reservations for us at a wonderful vegetarian friendly place only to find out that they would not be offering a vegetarian option for Valentine's day.  (Nothing says "I love you" like "you can't eat here").  This left him scrambling to find another place to eat, and he stumbled upon the vegetarian friendly Grazie.  As we approached the restaurant, you could hear how full of life and energy it was, even for such a typically quiet, romantic night.  I'm not one for an overly stuffy restaurant, so I love it.  There was a beautifully lit patio that stretches around the building completed with a large fireplace on the side.  The wine list was presented first, which was actually something of a disappointment from someplace calling themselves a wine bar.  I'll drink just about anything, and I liked the way it was arranged, but they were definitely lacking in a few more options.  However, we did enjoy a nice glass of Spanish chardonnay that went well with our food for the evening.  To begin, we chose the cheese platter, which was worth every penny of the $15 price.  Unaware of what exactly to expect (the menu did not list the cheeses), we were pleasantly surprised to find the 5 or 6 different kinds of cheeses presented in generous portions.  This certainly was not the skimpy cheese plates I'm used to.  However, because there was SO much cheese, we felt that it was almost overkill without some tomatoes or bread to cut the the richness.  (I'll never complain about too much cheese though).  For our meal, we split the Marcello pizza, which was delicately seasoned with garlic and topped with Roma tomatoes.  The crust was thin and crispy and held up well to the rich sauce.  Overall, Grazie is a place that I would recommend and visit again for some indulgent food and a beautiful ambiance.

Terrible.  I brought my boyfriend here a while ago for a romantic date out.  I thought it would be great because they had vegetarian paella for me and plenty of fish and meat for him to try.  (He doesn't normally get to do that too much since we go to mostly vegetarian places).  We got an appetizer, two entrees, and some sangria, and even with a $25 gift card, the bill was still over $90 with tip.  Now, this would not have been an issue had the food been worth that.  However, the food was terrible.  It was stuck in the 80's.  The beau's chicken looked like something you would get on an airplane, and my paella could have been shown up by something in a box... mushy rice with frozen veg.  The server also charged us for 2 salads that she just brought out.  I don't mind paying for a salad, but at least ask me!  At one point in our meal, my man got up and went to the restroom.  When he returned, he told me that I HAD to go look at it.  It was awful.  It was worse than any drive bars I have been to.  The paint was falling off the walls, one of the stalls didn't have a door and the other barely locked, the toilets were filthy, and the sink was disgusting.  If you charge $20-$40 a plate, you need to have the ambiance to back it up.  Never go here.

Dr. Patty is wonderful!  She treated us (and our cat) like family.  She was kind and helpful, and especially sympathetic to our sick kitty.  She took the time to explain our options and their costs, which was great.   It's been less than a week, and they have already called 3 times to check in on our cat.   The pricing was fair.  It was $57 for the office visit, $50 for an antibiotic shot, and $90 for labs.  I would gladly pay it again here.

This is some of the best vegetarian pho out there.  It is so flavorful and delicious.  The veggies you get with it are perfect.  I have been to some other places where the veggie selection in the pho is lacking, but not here.  My man (a meat-eater) even gets the veggie broth because he actually likes it better.  (He does add some rare beef to it though).  The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating.    Happy hour is good.  I recommend the spring rolls, which are around $3 with happy hour.  You can certainly leave here happy, full, and with money still in your wallet.

I go to the Tempe location often since I'm usually at Cowtown or Casey's right around the corner, and it's a great place to run in and grab a drink or sit for a while and chat.  I met a friend there not too long ago who, surrounded by $900 bikes and dozens of Mac books reflecting in Ray Bans, proclaimed that she was "not cool enough" to be there.  However, after a while of smelling the freshly brewed coffee and taking in the unique art, she changed her mind.  Try the dirty whore.  It's a house-made horchata with a shot of espresso.  YEEEEES.

I love Nancy's! I've been going here for about three years now, and I am always so happy after I leave. Maya and Jonny are the best! They always make me feel right at home and pay close attention to my nails and preferences. If something isn't perfect, they start all over and make sure it's done right.   I just walked out after getting a gel manicure (my usual), and I couldn't be happier. I chose a color that is not usually my style (which Maya noted), and when it was finished, we both notice that it looked a little plain. I've seen the amazing work Maya can do, so I just told her to do some designs that she thinks would look best. They look amazing! I can't stop staring at them!   If you are in the ASU area and looking for a great nail place, you should definitely check out Nancy's

I've lived in Tempe for a long time, and I haven't really found a salon that I love yet. I've gone off of Groupons and friends' recommendations and still haven't been able to find a salon that isn't super stuffy and doesn't completely overcharge me.  I have been to HelloGorgeous Salon twice now. I initially went in with a Groupon (just like almost everyone else), and unlike a lot of places, they were really nice and almost excited about my Groupon. Because I needed quite a bit of color correction in my hair, I was there for over four hours in my first visit. Kristen was a amazing; she was super patient, and we got along really well. My color and cut turned out awesome, and they were really reasonable with prices!!  I just got back from my second visit, and I can say that I have found my new go-to salon. I am so happy with the color, and I really feel like Kristen puts a lot of care and attention into getting my hair how I want it.  I would highly recommend checking this place out!

This place is wonderful! The food is fantastic and fresh. I got the vegetarian burrito, which was full of saut√©ed veggies in a light sauce (not your typical rice, beans, and cheese). The boyfriend had carne asana tacos that he loved.   Our server Verenice was one of the best I've had in a while.   Check this place out!!
