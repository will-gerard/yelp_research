Had wonderful experience at this theater. No weird smell. The chairs are also clean. Staff are very friendly too.  Parking is hassle and expensive. Their website direct people to park at AZ Center which is further down on the other side of the street. It's better to park next to the theater or convention center.

We just had a birthday party last night at the restaurant. It was a great experience. The services is very good and the waiters are really nice. It's a cozy place to have party with 20+ people. We pretty much take over 80% of the space.   The sushi is just as good as any other good Japanese restaurant. However, the sea food noodle soup I ordered is a little too salty. They also offer diner roll and Thai foods, which is unusual in the Japanese restaurant.   I can tell they work really hard to fill up 20+ hungry party animals. I was too full to have the dessert. Their frozen chocolate cake looks very delicious. I will visit again without the entire party.

Great place for travelers to stay. It's very close to airport and the hotel is clean and smells good.   It's a little noise, since it's very close to highway I-10, but you can ask the room on other side of the plaza. So it's much quiet. The restaurant in the hotel looks really nice and food are great too.

As good as the average Starbucks. Came in on Saturday morning, it's crowded. Coffee is perfect as I expected. Although, the parking was a little inconvenient, because the crowd.   There is NOT many seats for staying at the coffee shop though.

Had 5 cars done at AZM. The best window tint shop. They also have audio system too. Actually sitting in the shop waiting for my new window tint. Post from iPhone.  **************************************************** WAIT! Here is the update 2009-06-30 1:55PM **************************************************** Had 5 cars window tinted at the shop in the past years. I think I have gave the 5 stars review too fast. The owner seem to changed few time in the past year. I will write more review about this shop when I get my car fixed.  The first 4 cars tinted in the past years are perfect. Somehow the 5th one got screwed up. The job was done OK with a visible gap/edge between the film and the window frame. They took the car back for re-tint some of the pieces. It turns out using the wrong film and scratch/chip the window frame on my new car. They guy tinted the window seem to be nice, but getting inpatient when we ask why the frame was chipped and the film was wrong. Not trying to finger point, but wanted to get it fixed.   Waiting for the owner to call back and see what they can do to fix it. Will update the review.  **************************************************** WAIT! Here is the update 2009-07-01 4:55PM **************************************************** Finally, the re-tinted windows are fixed without no cost. The chipped window frame will be replaces with one of the body shop without cost me anything. It is very hassle, but they are willing to work out the issues and fix the problem.   Still give them 5 stars, since I was very satisfied with them for the first 4 cars.

Very good Vietnamese foods. However, the water always taste like breached water. The best noodle soup and fry pork rice dish around that area. Very good price for lunch, especially for people work cross street at Intel. It's crowed over weekend.   One thing to keep in mind when paying the bill. Double check the total price after tax. They sometimes add extra couple dollars if you don't pay attention.

Very good brew coffee, free Internet, Thursday night music, open late over weekday, what else do you expect a Internet coffee shop do for you?   This place has been the best social place other than bar. Many people bring their own laptop and sit there for a whole day. I am one of them.   It's a place that I have my business deal settled. The family owned  coffee shop. It's never to rush!!!

The dim sum is very good at C-Fu. It's always crowed over weekend. The only think I always told people about this restaurant is that their food is too salty. It tastes very good, but you will have to keep drinking water or tea to digest the salt.   They have the test chicken feet in town. Don't tell me you don't like it until you give it a try. :-)

This place is used to be my favorite Dim Sum restaurant, but I have not visited them for a while. It's not because of their foods.   Their foods is good and service is OK. It's their sneaky behavior at the register that bothers me. I don't know if they are still doing the same thing, but I just got pissed of once for all.   Here is the story.   I was at the cashier desk to pay my bill. The lady at the counter did not know I can understand Cantonese. So the lady told customer, who is a friend of her, that the 15% tips is already included in the credit card receipt as total. So there is no need to put tips in the blank tip line.   What a shocking finding. If you don't calculate your total bill, you may be paying double tips! What a shame on them. I don't mind to pay 20% tips, but they should told their customer that the total number on your receipt already includes tips!  I have not visited the restaurant since!

There is no other place that sells more Asian grocery than Lee Lee. It is the best place that you can find Asian foods in Arizona. 99 Ranch at the Chinese culture center are no way to compete with this one.   You can pay US$90 to get US$100 paper money. So you save $10. There are many fresh live fish, sea foods that the staff can kill and clean and even fry them for you at no extra charges. The owner moved the store twice and is going to open another store in East Gilbert soon.   You can see many Asian from many countries shopping here. Thursday morning is the best time to shop there, because they usually put new fresh items on Wed night.

I thought I found the nice and close place to see doctor. The doctor Mark was nice, but the wait time is horrible. First, I was waiting for 50 minutes to get an annual exam for 5 minutes.   Second, 2 months later after I did my annual exam on 2/1/2016, I started getting calls from the lab that took my blood sample saying I owe them money, because of the wrong code was sent to the lab. I called the clinic several times. They kicked the ball between billing department, office and doctor several times.   At the moment of writing this review 6/15/16, the billing issues is still not resolved. Their office staff said they marked my case as top priority 2 days ago and notified the office manager to give me a call back.I haven't got a single call back.   Now the lab threaten me to send the debt collector to knock on my door. What a horrible experience with this clinic.   Why wasting time dealing with all this hassle.

This golf course is pretty long for me. However, it's a great place to play 9 holes with breakfast included. Been there twice and will definitely come back. The golf course is well maintained. The restaurant section is clean and cozy.   You should just come early for the 9 hole golfing or you will spend more than 3 hours from start to finish.

Just went there for the first visit. Dr. Tang was recommended by few Chinese friends of mine, who said Dr. Tang is one of the greatest dentist in Gilbert, AZ.   Had so much bad experience with other local dentists. This one must be very good, since many Chinese friends mentioned his name.  After all, the clinic is very clean. All equipments are handled very well and secured. Dr Tang is very nice. Had a great experience with him. Totally recommend everyone to see Dr. Tang.   Glad to be the first one to recommend him on Yelp.

This is one of my favorite Mexican fast food restaurants. It's clean and cool in the summer. It's neal the theater and my house. You can alway ask for more meat without extra charge. Of course, they will charge you if you ask two spoun more. :-)  The parking space is not as big as the store and it's crowed over the weekend.

I was told to check this place out by two other trusted auto repair shops in Gilbert, where I will have to pay more to replace the catalytic converter and wait for 5 days to get the part.   So I did my research online. I called Mesa Muffler few times to see if they will say something different each time.   The first time I called, the price was $40 higher than the last call and I was told there is only 25K miles warranty. I asked the part they will install for my Honda Accord and find out it should be 50K miles warranty by Federal law . They double checked and admit it should be 50K miles warranty.   I finally decide to stop by today and give them a shot. I came in at 9:00AM and I was out of their in matter of 32 minutes. Two guys were working on the car while I was standing there watching.   So far the car is running great without the engine light on and no leak or noise, which should not happen anyway. Will see if anything come up in few weeks.   PS. If you pay cash, you can get extra discount.  PS. Make sure you call few times and get all your questions answered. PS. I give them 4 stars because of their inconsistency on the phone, otherwise, I will give them 5 stars.

I came to this place more than 10 years ago until I heard there is a new owner and new menu recently. I decided to give them a shot.   FOODs are so so and the service is horrible. Staff are friendly, but it took 34 minutes to get a bowl of noodle. Really? Be prepare to wait for a LONG time.   Their excuse was to make sure every table get at least one item, so everyone is happy. It then takes turn to server other items. Some people came 25 minutes behind us was getting their foods before our noodle. That's just ridiculous. It means everyone is waiting for their second item or so. I guess people order more than one items wont' be happy.   Will I come back? Maybe just for take out.

This used to be my most visited Starbucks, because of it's location. It's only 1 miles away from my house.   Ever since they change the layout and still using AT&T WiFi, I lost my interest to visit this location.   Coffee is still as good as it should be, but the new layout with a huge table in the center makes it hard to pass by when the place is packed. It's also hard to make it a place to meet with client. It's too loud.   The staff are so friendly and awesome. It's almost 5 star perfect.

To be honest, this is my first time playing 18 holes golf game ever. I am a very beginner. This place is beautiful, especially under the cloudy day in early December in Arizona (See photo).   My friend book the early tee time online for Wed for only $18 per person including golf cart. We had good time playing golf there. The staff at the front door giving us the golf cart key is very nice.  I have never played at other golf course at suck price, so I am unable to compare. I will be playing tomorrow again. Hope I get even better experience this time.

Unbelievable little place. This place is always crowded before 12:00pm and will be closed at 2:00pm. The parking is tough and the waiting is about 40 minutes if you arrive at 11:00am.   Coffee is so-so, but the taco omelet is so delicious. Although it doesn't look like 3 eggs omelet as it claims to be, it's big enough for me. The service is a little slow, but the staff are very friendly.  No wonder it's packed with eaters.   Even with some minor complaints about the waiting time, coffee, and parking, it is really worth to pay a visit.  I am sure to come back to try different dishes.

The store is located in Tempe near ASU. The staff are well trained photographer. They don't push you to buy anything, but answer all my questions regarding my future equipments.   Their price is a little bid higher than the other store, but I felt more comfortable to shop there. I got what I want faster and safer. They also provide rental service which seem to be attractive. I can play with a new camera before I decide to own it.   It's nice to have a store with real-life photographer at local area.

I actually met the owner at other local family owned restaurant, who gave me a tour of his flower shop. A huge freezer room and huge place full of gifts and flowers. It's very nice to see some local family owned business doing well and still giving back to the local community.   Support local businesses is one thing, offering quality products and services is another. They put those two together very well. I would not have second thought when I order the flower from local shop. They even have online store that you can place order from pretty much anywhere in Arizona or even out of state. They will take care of you! I have never heard about flower happy hour and free flower on Fridays. They have coupon for that at http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1055/  After all, they really know how to communicate with local community. Many local businesses I met are already their customers. It's a small world, but Bobbie's flowers and gift shop makes it a wonderful world.  I totally recommend!

There is no doubt that the foods is good. The cooker is Chinese. Not like other Chinese restaurant, they are Mexican cooker.   The service is slow and tea taste like unfiltered water. Week day is the best time to eat there. Otherwise, it's crowed sometimes. Not a place for take out and fast dinner, but good for a group of people having long dinner.

I went to this Pei Wei a while back. it was crowed and the foods taste good. I stop going there after I saw the bad reviews on TV channel 5 in 2005. There were 8 violations regarding to their kitchen.   I still like the Pei Wei at other locations though.

The Dim Sum is too American. It's not good Dim Sum for real Chinese. There was another Jade Palace in Chandler. The brothers open the store in different places, but the quality is no good any more. It was once my favorite Chinese Restaurant.  Please check out their Kitchen before order foods. See yourself.

First of all, I visited this place many times in the past many years. They used to be a great place to have dim sum. I was never so disappointed like this.   We walked in today (Saturday at 12:24PM) and was wondering where the customers are. Saturday is usually the most busy day for every dim sum places. The restaurant is pretty empty out.   We sat down and order 5 dishes. That's where the problem came. I don't like to be treated like moron. Why there is 6 dishes marked on the sheet?   We kindly asked manager to check it out. Long story short, they turn into deny mode. And finally removed the extra marked item we never ordered without offering any apology and sorry. Mistake does happen, but don't pretend that you don't know it. Admit it. The portion of the dishes are also shrinking. With the price and services, I can find better dim sum place. Yes. I am really picky on the food quality and service.   Fool me once is enough. I will suggest everyone to pay attention on the bill. Always count how many items you ordered and how many are marked on the bill.   I have post pictures as well.

As a true Chinese grew up in Taiwan, I know what Taiwanese foods supposed to taste like. It's here. The owner is a native Taiwanese. Not like other Chinese restaurant, the owner make the special ingredients everyday herself.     The price is good and reasonable cheap. There is no better place to taste the traditional Taiwanese foods. My favorite dish is the spicy noodle.

This is the best Dim Sum in entire Arizona. The owner was the cookers of Great Wall on 35th Ave, Phoenix. They moved to Chandler and start their own restaurant.   If you want the best Chinese traditional Dim Sum, you can't miss this one. We used to drive 40mile one-way to have Dim Sum in Phoenix. Thanks to the owner, I only need to drive 8 miles round trip now.

Can't believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago. To be honest, I don't go there any more for few reasons.   1. The owner has changed 2. The foods quality has changed 3. Service is NOT as good as it used to be.  4. The original chief seem to be long gone.  5. Found a better places to have the best DIM SUM in Chandler AZ  Once very satisfied customer is no longer their customer. If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services, go somewhere else. I guess I will never know how good their foods now. Don't even want to try.

This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling.   For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told "Too late" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints.   Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told "No". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them.   I will not buy anything from them again.

One of the best local private owned BBQ restaurants. They also offer free meal for birthday visitors.   Their rib is as good as what  you see on TV. It's more like country style BBQ. Their homemade root beer is great too.   If you like BBQ, you should give them a try!

The chicken burger is surprising good. I also ordered the onion rings which is pretty fresh made. The place is quiet at Wed. afternoon and you get 25% off with the receipt you had last time. Not a bad deal at all. Wife ordered the Gyro, it comes with lots meat. It's enough for us to take home as snack.   The buffet don't looks so attractive to me anyway, but I would like to try other burgers.

I don't eat fried chicken very often, but this chicken fingers are very tasty. Not like other franchise fried chicken. I did not get fries and got extra chicken fingers.   The place is small, but the owner Alin is awesome man. I was very much focusing on the chicken and sauce. Haven't tried all the sauces, but will give them a shot.   Some people tweet on social network about the tasty Chicken meals. Even news crews were there as well. Now the only place you can find their coupon is http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1054/  The owner will even give more free stuff if you show the coupon on your iPhone or smart phone. So you don't have to print and bring in the coupons.   I would recommend everyone to eat at their restaurant. The chicken fingers are too tasty to resist! Best Fried Chicken in Town.

This is really traditional Chinese Dim Sum. As a picky eater, this is our newest favorite Dim Sum place in the East Valley.   This is also our official meetup place for people to learn Chinese table manners and learning Chinese Language. We meet every few weeks on Sunday. You can also take out the Dim Sum, which we usually do when there is crowd. This place used to be empty when they started few years ago. Now the word of mouth brought them so many customers. You will have to wait in you come after 11:30AM. A friend of mine come down there every week from fountain hills to meet with us.   The staff is very nice and friendly. They also have a quiet room for reservation if you have party of 10 more. If you are shopping at Lee Lee supermarket, you don't want to miss this Dim Sum place.

Finally decide to pay a visit to this place in Peoria, which is an hour drive for me. Was not expect to be as good as it seem in my photos. It actually fill me up very well.   The place is clean with nice interior decoration. I spent 4 hours there eating 4 dishes and chat with the staff and the owner. It was a great experience that you don't usually get from Chinese restaurant. This place is also huge inside.   I like their foods and friendly services.

I thought I had review for this place a long time ago. Obviously, I have not done my part to give this company a 5 stars. This is the place I will think about first, when I am hungry. They sandwich are fresh made in front of you. I alway ask them to toast my sandwich, so they taste even better than cold.   I also like to add 2 extra shots to my 32oz. super sized iced soy latte. It's the best combination. Looks like there will be a new Starbucks cross street, but the coffee at Great Harvest Bread is still my favorite choice.

This is the my favorite Costco. It's less than 8 miles from my house and the staff are so nice. Most important, the fruits are fresh.  Not all store are dealing with customer the same way. I find that customers shop at this location are more polite than other location. The parking lot are a lot of bigger than other location.

The best place to hang out with friend over breakfast and business meeting over lunch. It's clean and crowded, but the environment is just cozy enough to sit for a long time. Free refill coffee makes it perfect.   The only downside is that their wi-fi is really slow and unstable.

Friendly services and quick turn around time. I sent in my PING driver to get fixed, they called and arrange the pickup and drop-off. I got my driver back in 3 business day.   They also have more golf shoes available to try out.  Their price may not be the cheapest, but the store is very convenience and have all the thing I need from one place. The best place for hot summer shopping.

Great foods that satisfied real Chinese.   With the $4.75 lunch special with drink and egg roll. What can you ask for more? It's cheaper than cup of coffee. Great cooker and very friendly restaurant owner.   Tried their lunch twice. Will try their dinner menu later.

The only place for me to make color print. Don't have color printer in house. So glad that they have great laser color copier that can take care of my color printing need in matter of minutes.   Got my mailbox over there with keys that I can access anytime. Family owned print shop. It's like family in the businesses. A place to chat with other local people. Actually meet other business owners there too. It may becomes a meetup place for local businesses someday. That will be nice. Isn't it?

What a small world. I was told by an art collector in Scottsdale AZ that I can get my expensive artworks ship in North Scottsdale AZ with custome crating and freight shipping at reasonable price, which you can't find anywhere with other big shipping center. So I decided to drive miles from S. Chandler up to PostNet in N. Scottsdale to see it myself.   In turns out they are owned by the brothers of this PostNet. No wonder they offer the same great quality services. You can see my other review about the N. Scottsdale PostNet, but I am glad that I have both trusted locations to get my shipment done right.

Not sure why it happens that way. The customer services at the infant section are always much nicer than the adult cloth section. Agree with the other review. Their staff need a better customer service training.   Their fitting room is very comfortable to me. Very roomy. It's the best GAP store I have visit so far!

Finally found a great cuban restaurant in the valley. Drove by thousand times and decided to give it a try with a special coupon. Surprisingly it's really authentic cuban food.   The place is bigger than it look from outside and the waitress were very nice and friendly. The owner also came to say hi and ask if there is anything to improve. Had wonderful lunch experience at the place. Will come back again.

First of all, I am not a massage type of person before I visit this place. I never felt comfortable to have someone's hands on my back. After reviewing all the options I found on the Internet. I decided to pay a visit to Massage Heights in Gilbert AZ. The store manager Barry actually gave me a tour before I made my decision to stay or not. I asked a lot of questions about everything I had doubt about massage therapy. He answered all the questions nicely even I forgot that after all.  While I was waiting, the lady at counter answered phone very professionally that make me feel more conformable. She has to arrange some appointment for those people who changed schedule. I am not the only one decide to walk in. There are two girls in front of me. I have to wait a little longer, because I walked in without making appointment. Should make appointment before visiting. Wished they offer FREE Wi-Fi, so I can get some work done while waiting.  Anyway, they offer introductory coupons on the Internet that you can print at http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1066/   Their room is clean and quiet. After all, it's a great experience and good decision to pay a visit. Will recommend my sister-in-law to get relax treatment when she visit us.

Discovered this oldest barber shop near ASU (Arizona State University) in Tempe AZ from one of the local event. The old school style haircut for man only. It's not a salon, but it's definitely a place if you want to get nice haircut and some dirty joke while watching sports or news on two giant big screen TV.   This is the oldest barbershop since 1962. They only open from Tuesday to Saturday. This is s small place without fancy decoration. They have many numbered haircut photos on their wall so you just tell them the number they will do the rest.   They don't have any web site or advertisement, so you can only find their coupon at http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1069/ to save some money!  They seem to take cash only. They have the oldest cashier register machine I have ever seem though.

I have only been this place once and I will come back again.  I just can't believe that I forgot taking the photos of the food I ordered. This place is really clean. The sandwich was good and tasty. The girl took my order is pretty.   Well. I will just give them 4 stars. The gentlemen made my sandwich need more smile to make it 5 starts. I know! I am perfectionist. Maybe he was tired or not in the mood or maybe I was just too cheap with a coupon found online.    Anyway, he needs more smile just like they did on TV.

This is my favorite local coffee shop! The owners are very friendly.   My favorite drink is the Iced Soy Latte. It's not only strong enough, but it's also good coffee. This is also the best place that I meet with my customers for business meeting.   The place is very convenient for people who love to shop at San Tan village mall. If you don't like the summer heat of Arizona, this is a great place chill you down with a cup of ice coffee.   Their FREE WI-FI requires you to login, which may kick you out if your computer are on the idle mode for more than half hour. Almost forgot to mention that their sandwich is good too!   If you are savvy shopper like me, you can actually find their FREE coupon online by searching "Free coffee coupons gilbert" on Google! :)   I do however, wish they have projector, so I can use their place for a presentation. I also think they own the other place in the San Tan Mall Food court! So you can get same quality coffee at two very close places in one stop shopping!  PS: The pin on the map is wrong! Yelp need to move the pin to the correct location! It's actually East of San Tan Village Parkway and next to the Blue  Wasabi Sushi and Martini Bar restaurant.

I came to this location because my wife's company had emergency, so she has to get online. This is one of the most busy Starbucks I've visited. It's packed with long line at Saturday afternoon.   The wi-fi is still AT&T and it's slow like hell. I was waiting in the long line. Before I get my chance to order my usual coffee, my wife is already done. That was how long it took to order a Pike Place.   The parking space is just nightmare. I would not come here to relax.   But I have to say, the staff stays cool and friendly with so many in-patient customers rush to get their drink. Thumb up to the customer services. Shame on the customers and the property management.

I know many people were pissed by the restaurant. I was one of them about two years ago until recently visited the business two doors down and realized they changed the ownership.  *** New Owner ***  This place has a new owner since September 2010. It's now named "Hot Wok Chinese Restaurant". I decided to give it a shot. I saw a familiar face. The chef is actually from my favorite dim sum place "Phoenix Palace" in Chandler.   Obviously, he starts his own business now. Good for him. So I ordered the lunch with a friend of mine. At price of $5.00, I did not expect too much from it, but I have to admit that it tasted really good. Well I hope I was not treated differently.   So I went back second time last week and today. I ordered a shrimp (surprising big - See my picture) and asked not to make it too salty. The chef did what I asked for.   I will give him 4 stars for now. The food is great for the price, but I think he can do even better since I like what he did at his previous chef job at Phoenix Palace. I don't mind to pay few dollars more for larger portion. He needs to make difference than the previous owner.   I will come back again until I tried all the dishes.

Really. I have no idea how much money my wife and I have spent here. We bought whole lot of kids cloth for our nephews. This place is very convenient to us, which there are many stores nearby.   The staff is always very friendly. They don't mind go through their inventor and told us there are some new items in the back. So we are very happy to shop at this place.

Great place to get relax. Went there twice already and will go again. Afternoon is usually more quiet and you can also enjoy your own private room foot massage. It's very close to where I work, so it's convenient to just make appointment and visit.   The place is clean and quiet. Just remember to lower your voice when you walk in.

Very delicious! Wish I can eat more!  Talked to the owner and like what I heard about how they started the business. Great place to have family dinner.   Monday seems to be the slowest day. Will try to bring the lunch club to the place.

Really. I can't say enough good thing about this company. It's a wonderful idea that every dog and cat lover should join. I had great experience with the owner of this company who is dedicated in loving our best friends.   I was out of country for 3 weeks. Imaging if we are the pets that don't get to see the world and stay home without the care or love. It will drive us crazy. This service will arrange the best host for your pets, so you don't have to worry about their condition.   Great services for our best friends!

This is a newly opened locally owned coffee shop in Gilbert. Spent 20 minutes talking to the owner before noon when there was only 3 customers.  Personal opinions:  1. The coffee isn't as strong as I expected 2. There is no Wi-Fi (They said they will add that later) 3. The fresh cookies is good but can be better 4. There is no clear sign on the street, so it's very easy to miss. 5. It's on the west side of Cooper rd, not the best place for morning coffee before driving to work.  6. Nice out door sitting area facing S. It will be very hot for summer.  7. There is enough space for business meeting. Very quiet and very clean.   If there is Wi-Fi, it will be my alternative office space.

Been here hundred times. Yes. I am not exaggerating. I wonder why I haven't write review until now.   This is the first place I will consider when I need Chinese food. It's very traditional cozy environment like my home town restaurant. The food is great and staff are very friendly. Even the boss behind the glass window making the dumpling are always smiling. It's not a fancy restaurant, but the foods is really authentic and awesome.   Just to keep in mind that they are very popular and busy, so be prepare to wait if you are coming on Friday noon, or over the weekend.   It's your own fault, if you have waited for a long time to be seated.   .

The only buffet restaurant I will eat in Scottsdale. Period.   The space and seating are is huge and comfy. We even discovered a new area that is more quiet for group. Food are fresh and delicious. You can also ask for sashimi if they are not prepared already. Great services and price is also reasonable. You can easily find twenty-percent coupon online to print.   If you love seaweed, it's the best place to eat as much as you like. They also offer few special dishes over holiday. Such as lobster for Chinese new year, steak for X'mas etc.

I've been here countless time. If I want to eat soup and shop grocery, this is the only place I will get my fish soup with several different add-ons.   If you coming at lunch time over the weekend, you will wait probably 30 minutes to be seated.

First time here. I can't believe it took me 2 year to find there is a great noodle soup house 3 miles away from where I live. Obviously, they don't need to advertise. The seem to have 70+ reviews on Yelp at 4.5 rating.   Order the tomato beef noodle soup and Wonton noodle soup off the Chinese menu, they are very delicious. It's very traditional Hong Kong foods. There English menu looks too Americanize though.

How many times did you hear Starbuck staff say "Good morning" in one visit.    I heard 7 times here even it was afternoon. LOL! I guess they have a long day already. The coffee is no different than any other Starbucks locations, but the staff is the nicest so far.

Discovering this awesome place. It doesn't have fancy decoration and looks just like I am visiting Vietnam. Friendly staff and clean. Obviously they do use filter for the drinking water. The water taste good. The price is slightly higher than other Vietnam restaurants in the valley, but the portion of the foods is big enough fit into a to-go box.

Exactly what I expect for Korean restaurant. Was told about how good their foods taste. I am satisfied with the choice.   The food are just as delicious as my photoshows. It's better to go as a group, so you can share many different dishes. The portion is huge enough for hungry people like me.  Stone Rice bowl is HUGE.

Finally a hot pot restaurant that fill me up without emptying my wallet. Great environment for small group of people to try out their hot pot.   Was told this is the place for great hot pot and bbq. Was very happy about the experience with this restaurants. The owner couple are very young, energized and friendly.   Although the background music is a little loud, but I was focusing on the food too much. Don't go there after 7:00pm to mid-night over weekend unless you want to hang out with young Chinese crowd.   They did offer different sauce for the hot pot, but you have to ask for it. My favorite is the the seafood hot pot.

The only place in Chandler to get real Taiwanese food. My favorite one are Fried Chicken and Fried Fish dishes. There is no other place that make the taste so original.   Not to mention that the boba milk tea is just as good as you can get in Taiwan. The owners are very friendly your own family. It's clean and great place to hang out with friend over the weekend and a great place for quick business lunch.   Highly recommend!

Beautiful place. Saw them on Groupon and seem to have great reviews on both their location. Decide to give them a try. The staff are very friendly. Took wife with me the second time. And we both really enjoyed the massage. Be sure to come on-time.

Very cozy environment. The staff is friendly and not pushy. I can sit on their demo furniture for 20 minutes without been interrupted. However, their FREE Starbuck coffee taste like water. Well. It's FREE.   I went there for the painting and rugs. Unfortunately, their products seem to be over-priced comparing to other wholesale furniture warehouse.   Since I came all the way from Gilbert, they said that I will have to pay for extra shipping cost? Or I have to pick it up by myself? I wonder if the sales rep is new or simply telling me the wrong story?   I did not buy the painting there, because you can find identical one online from other warehouse at lower price. I guess that's one of the reason they don't even offer Free WiFi.   I will still give them 4 stars for their friendly and cozy environment.

Oh Boy. What a great dinner experience there.   We have a group of six. I came first at around 6:20pm and my group arrived at about 6:35pm. We received a very friendly welcome, and the owner Carlo very kindly introduce their menu items to bunch people (at least me) who don't know much about Italian food. He also gave us a plate of meat to try out. All I want is lots meat, so I picked pastrami. I was more than happy to see the portion, because it's more I can chew. No surprise that I was the one finished my dinner first. It was very tasty.   We do feel sorry to the owner Emilie and her staff who patiently wait for us to finish our dinner. We did not know they close on Monday at 7:00PM.  We left at about 8pm. Ouch. They should told us that they close at 7pm.   We pick their restaurant because of Yelp reviews. There was 48 reviews with 5 star rating, which is unbelievably odd. So 6 of us decided to give it a try. We have no doubt that they will get 49 reviews and still deserves 5 star rating.   I also had a bite of the chocolate cake. Well. I wished I ate the chocolate cake before finsihing the pastrami sandwich. I will come back and try different items and take out the cake. Period.

Had great time at this place. The manager is very friendly and polite.   Did the 90 minutes massage, and don't want to get up. Time just fly by so fast. That is how good I felt. Pretty refreshing.   The place was a little hard to find, since it's at downstairs.  So you only see the Massage sign and few other day spa businesses around. The lobby is a little empty too. I guess they just opened and will need some decoration and sofa for seating.   Great place. The parking is a little hard though.

Second time visiting this place. The first time was not good. Tried different items this time with more friends, so we can ordered more variety of foods.   It's much better this time.

Simply a great place for relaxation. Very friendly staff and really enjoy the visit. Twice in 3 weeks is enough to say how good the massage was. It was a little intense the first time to have people touching my toes, but it turns out feeling good after hour long treatment.   The price was reasonable. It's also wonderful that you can check-in Yelp and get the special for two. Will come back and try different massage therapist.

My new favorite place to go for spicy Chinese foods. I visited this place 4 times in a week and have tried total 12 dishes. They are all very good and tasty.   Some of them are little salty for me, but they seems to be fine for our American friends. Very clean and not so busy at the launch time.

Very exciting about the opening of this new restaurant. Love the wall paper which is very Hong Kong Style.   The Taiwan style beef noodle soup taste awesome. The Southern sea chicken are also delicious. Best of all, the Hong Kong style milk tea is a must have too.

I won't come back. I like their concept to have many different Asian fusion styles of foods. However, they are way over priced for the portion and ingredient. The Pho noodle is not even close to the picture on their menu. It taste too much like boiled soy sauce.   $28 for two with two boba tea taste watery, it's not worth the money for what they have to offer. I give them 2 star because of their friendly staff.  I came home still very much hungry.
