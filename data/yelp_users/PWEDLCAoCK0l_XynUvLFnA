How does an ice cream shop NOT have chocolate chip or mint chocolate chip for over two weeks! Come on -does someone need lessons in supply and demand? I only ask for ice cream every once in a while!

Originally this was going to be a two star but I have to say that due to one particular employee by the name of Sam the day was made! I had an appointment for 8am, confirmed and everything-but apparently there was a misunderstanding and no one showed up UNTIL 8am which meant it took 25 minutes to open the shop and get things ready! Sam had arrived early also because no managers had indicated that they wouldn't open until 8! Sam kept checking in on me and giving me updates until someone with a key showed up-the. When I picked up my car it looked great AND Sam offered a free wash for my husbands truck! Something so simple made me so appreciative and it recognized how precious my time is! Thanks Sam -but to the rest of the group i suggest you communicate with all of your staff in more detail! Why did an appointment get book at 8 and no one be there and why did you have employees there but no managers with a key?

Worst customer service and welcome o have ever experienced but now I'm here so they get my business because they know I'm here for a conference! The lack of enthusiasm or concern for me during the check in process has now placed a terrible taste in my mouth! I've never literally seen a check in representative saunter into the back to ask a question -as if my question was not worth her time!

Apparently the words "hot and ready" are just that -words and not an actual action and goal! Disappointing to come In and be told that we now have to wait ten minutes for what was promised as being ready when we walk in!

Granted - we received the gift certificate from a golf tourney but the heat was terrible! We have been here almost two hours and the room us no cooler and maintenance says there's nothing they can do! I'm fairly certain that they ONLY give this room to people who they give the certificates to! I love the heat but this is ridiculous.so I'm not important enough to you?!

Probably one of the best classes that I've ever attended! The instructor was incredibly welcoming, helpful, challenging, and knowledgeable! I normally walk out in pain instead of relaxed but he explained everything and have options for those of us who were new! Feeling fabulous

Love Dutch Bros coffee -far exceeds Starbucks any day and the service is amazing! I just wish the wait time was a lite better! This morning I waited at the window for apart 15 minutes just for a cup if coffee! Can there be a "coffee only" lane? ,)

Hate to do this but WOW my first cup of terrible coffee from here! I literally think they had it sitting around for a while-bitter and cold! Kinda disappointed since I had been dreaming about this cup since last night!
