I just bought a piece of furniture here at American Lifestyle Furniture, got home and it was broken.  Came back spoke to the manager, he informs me that there is no returns even though he acknowledges that they sold us a broken piece.  They cannot open another box to give us the broken piece they're telling us that they would have to order it and it could take until next week.  Management is not able to help us even though if they sold us a broken part.
