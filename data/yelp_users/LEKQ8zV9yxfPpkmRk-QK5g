Alaxandra-'Hey, who wants to join me for my birthday lunch'  Me- 'I'll go' That response was all it took and now I have 'my sushi spot'  It is a small restaurant with a lot to offer. Every time I walk in, I feel like I am stepping into a true Japanese restaurant. You get greeted by the 'sushi experts' ;) with a big welcome -spoken in Japanese- which I have yet to ask what exactly they are saying, but they sound happy and that's all that matters.  The freshest seafood, the best specials and the most fantastic miso soup, YUM! My goal is try almost everything on the menu and so far I am doing pretty good.

When I got the invite from a friend that we will call 'Little Hulk' to go grab a slice of pizza at his all time favorite spot, I was in. Along with his lovely wife Lindsay (a New Yorker, I might add), our friend Monty, and my hubby Shane, we all headed to a place called 'Ray's Pizza' for our Saturday night grub.  Located in a 'strip mall' (let's face it, everything around here is in a strip mall)  I realized that this is definitely not the local 'Saturday night hang out' since there were only three tables occupied.   I became a little skeptical, I must admit.   When Monty arrived (fashionably late) we all got up from our comfy booth (yes.. it was comfy) and went to order our slice (slices for me) of pizza . After looking at the menu that hangs in the wall, I was surprised to see that they also offered a selection of drinks- wine, pop (soda..depending where you're from) and beer. I ordered a Moretti beer (an Italian lager) that came with a frosty mug glass.. didn't even have to ask for it!  Lindsay ordered a cheese pizza from the different display of slices that they offered, and asked to have fresh tomatoes and jalapenos added to it..my kind of girl.  I had a thick crust (squared shape) cheese slice (middle slice, I might add), and a cheese, garlic and spinach slice.  Both slices were good, but after one bite of my cheese pizza..I was so happy! The cheese was gooey and tasty, the sauce was mild but packed with flavor, and the crust was buttery with a little crunch. We all enjoyed our pizza!  Skeptical? after a few bites, I was a fan.

First bar that I went to when I moved from Minnesota to Scottsdale 4 months ago. This is the bar that I still go to and love going to, the 'bar' food that has yet to disappoint, and the beer that I crave.  Great times had and great times to come.

Outside-Bricks walls with no attitude  Inside: dark wood, earth tone colors, a patio with a tree in the middle (with lights in it), a fireplace where you can gather with some friends, cozy seating and trivia game cards on the tables in case you want to play.  You step into this place and you feel a good vibe.   I have been here three times and have loved every experience. The food is fantastic, not big portions but is good for my diet ;) If you want to try something different, I would recommend the nachos that come with fries (hashbrown like) that are super yummy! not good for the diet... I always order their 'baller maritni' , it holds the perfect touch of orange and pineapple flavors along with a cherry at the bottom.. yum!  Now I'm thirsty.

This place is a gem. It is uniquely tucked away in area that is surrounded by art galleries.  With no sign to lure you in (except for a small open sign), we felt like we were in 'the know' once we found it.  Wooden floors, red and earth tones color walls and soft lighting made me feel cozy, relax and definitely ready to have a drink. The artwork that hangs on the walls are unique and provided us with some great topics of conversation.  They offer a great selection of bottle beer and a variety of wines. They do offer drinks specials,and though we were not told by the bartender, I found them posted in a piece of paper located in the fridge at the bar.  No food though.. even if they have a fridge ;)  I loved this place and I am glad to announce that it is no longer lost, but it has been found.

Didn't go for the food, went to celebrate a birthday tradition with 'da boot'! This place was awesome! You felt like you were at a friends house letting loose while dancing to the live music from the awesome band.  The atmosphere was low key with cool people which we really liked. The bar was small, but they have a big section that turns into a dance floor, with some comfy cushion I might add.  We will be back next year, so bring on 'da boot'

'Tart yogurt with brownies, strawberries, and raspberries.. wait no, with pineapples, mmm.. with blueberries!' So many choices, and they're all good. This is why this place is so fun and starting to be one of my favorites. As I drove by one today, I couldn't help but think..' should I stop?!' even though I just had finished eating a big burrito.  Thanks to Lindsay and 'Little Hulk' I was encouraged to try their crepe(s) and wow! the crepe added one more reason to keep me coming back!

' So how many pounds do you think I'll gain from one of their burgers? oohh... and with their lard fries?? ..I guess I'll take the chance!'  These are the words that I said to pump myself up for what I thought would be a burger worth the weight gain.. That didn't quite happen, not because I have a good metabolism but because they had NO BEEF! This was on a Saturday afternoon..  This was strike one.  Strike two: Went back, pumped myself up again, had the burger and was completely disappointed. The atmosphere was lacking, the fries were not memorable and the beef was just off in flavor.  All this unhappiness and I am still trying to work out the extra pounds.  2 stars for effort.

Love the spring rolls! The food is what you mainly come here ( I know- sounds weird) but if you are like me and enjoy a little ambiance with you dinner, this little spot does not provide much. The waitresses have always been really pleasant and work hard. They are quick in serving you, so if you are really hungry, go here and they will fill your belly with some yummy thai goodness. If you are thristy for a beer, go to Four Peaks around the corner because they do not serve any liquor.  I definitely would order take-out from this little spot anytime!

I have hesitated on writing this review because I absolutely- without a doubt - LOVE THIS PLACE!  Finding the write words and trying to describe their fantastic dishes will lead me to write a book and not a review, so I will put it like this:  Quality food Caring chefs that enjoy what they do and have a passion Excellent flavors Trendy but the staff will make you feel at home.
