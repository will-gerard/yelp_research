This is nothing disparaging about the food. The food is quite tasty and exceptional. However, the service was less than stellar. I waited 10 minutes for my dessert and another 15-20 for my check, and my water was not refilled once. It was impossible to get anyone's attention to get service which is enough to put me off and not want to come back. Personally, I don't pay good money to wait on a server, I pay to get waited on. That may make me a snot but it's what I expect when I go to a restaurant.

Rosie's is mine and my sister's go to beer place. It is conveniently close and just very cozy. I always get the Magner's Cider which is so damn delicious, and Wenesday's live performer is always so delightful to listen to.

The cupcakes are DIVINE. It is like eating an orgasm, especially the brown velvet. And because it is organic, it makes me feel a little better. It might not necessarily be healthy but the fact that it's organic allows me to pretend that it is. SO NUMMY!!!

It's a standard chain, but I'm a CPK faithful. I like the food; it combines Italian American faves and tries to do something different with it. The Kung Pao spaghetti is legit, so good!

I love this place. I have had dinner there twice now. The owner and our waitress were amazing. The food has been delicious both times. I am in love with this place.

I went for a mani/pedi with Ashley and she was fantastic. The mani/pedi lasted for days, and she was very friendly. My only gripe is that their groupons fill up quick that I had to save mine till the last 2 weeks before. Other than that, I'd probably go back.

I made a deal with myself that I would wait at least ten classes (the amount before results are said to be seen) before I reviewed. I've only been to nine but screw it because in the nine, my body has definitely seen a change. My ass is way perkier, my arms a little toner, and my tummy much flatter than what it was. I have never seen quicker results.  I used to believe I was in shape. I run 2-3 times a week really long distances and went regularly enough to the gym. After Pure Barre, not so much. I still remember the ass cramp I had after my first class (lasted for days). I have never had a harder work out in my life. Apart from the fact I am made increasingly aware of my lack of flexiblity, every muscle in me shakes, quivers, and burns every class. I often feel like the special needs kid in the back of the class struggling but the only true failure in this workout is not trying. And the instructors are very patient and helpful so even if you are having trouble, you won't feel like a total 'tard the entire way through. (Thanks Christa, Karli, & Veronica)   I've made it an entire month through and am now making a commitment to keep doing Pure Barre for a full year just to see what happens to my body in addition to my running. I'm super excited to have found Pure Barre.  Lift. Tone. Burn.

The ambiance is cool, but everything about this place stenches of mediocrity. The service is below average; seriously, we waited 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, really? The food was okay; nothing special. I would be just as happy with In-and-Out. I am not sure this place is worth all the hype.
