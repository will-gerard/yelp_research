I was worried at first because there were a couple weddings going on while we were there, but they didn't interfere with anything. And, overall, the staff, restaurants, room, pool, and almost everything seemed perfect.  I did have one complaint, there didn't seem to be an exhaust fan or window in the toilet room in the bathroom. Since it's physically in the middle of the suite, it seemed odd, and I didn't even think that was possible with building codes. There seemed to be no exhaust ventilation to the toilet room at all. I asked some other guests if they had the same issue in their room, and they said yes.  Based on the bathroom issue alone, I wouldn't really pick this as the place to stay. And would avoid it if I was sharing the room with someone.  Other than that, there wasn't anything else to complain about.

This is a fun place to have a drink almost any night.  There is a very friendly vibe here.  It's not the kind of place you want to go if you are feeling antisocial.  And it's not the kind of place to go if you want to get rowdy.  I strongly disagree with the other review that said it's a rowdy crowd.  It's very friendly, open, and outgoing.  But "rowdy" would make it sound aggressive or violent, and I've never felt that vibe here.  If you sit outside or at the bar, you're going to end up chatting with people sitting next to you.  The staff is friendly, and usually pretty quick.  And the bartenders are always helpful, and willing to let you order things that other places might give you a hard time about (black and tan that's heavy on the black, or a mixed drink with any special instruction).  The bouncer is the coolest guy, but will not put up with anyone giving the staff or other customers a hard time.  If it weren't for him, I could see this place being rowdy.  He sort of sets the feel for the place, and does a great job.  It's not like he's never had to throw someone out, but he does and will the instant someone seems disruptive.  The live bands are usually good.  And when there isn't a band, the jukebox has a very wide range of music.  If you don't like what's playing, give it 5 minutes and you probably will like the next song.  And I've never had anything to eat here that I didn't think was great.  The thing I can think of that might be negative is parking.  But that's true of most places downtown Phoenix, so it doesn't really count against them.

Every time I walk past this place I think "how sad, what wasted potential."  The hours are horrible, it's always closed, when it's open it's dead inside.   I wouldn't mind having a glass of wine on the patio on a Sunday afternoon with my iPad or laptop, but it's not open at all on Sundays, and there is no WiFi.    I've been with friends a few times that were impressed with the parmesan fries, and I've heard other people talk about them.  Look at the ridiculous number of reviews of how great the $7 french-fries are, and how very few reviews of the $22 steaks.  It want's to be upscale, but it's best known for it's french-fries?  I suspect the parmesan fries are popular because it's is an ideal location for an upscale hangout or wine bar or something, so people will pay $7 for french-fries.  But no one wants to bother having dinner there. It's a good location and has potential on the surface.  I have frequently walked in hoping to "relax" after work, but every time I get halfway through my first drink I just want to leave and feel like I'd rather be anywhere else.  There seems to be no attempt to cater to the sort of crowd the place actually is able to get.  From the outside it looks like a nice upscale, relaxing, fun place to have a glass of wine and hang out.  But, the atmosphere is an odd negative energy, it's just not relaxing or fun.  Sitting at the bar is the slightly better indoor seating choice because the booths and tables really are not any more comfortable.  Plus, when you do ask for a table or booth, they seat you so close to the other customers you listening to each other's conversations anyway. I think it's just the acoustics of the place, you feel like you have to whisper to the people you are with which makes you uneasy, and everyone else is whispering and you can hear everything they are saying anyway.    I personally think the prices are ridiculously high, not because of the quality of food, because of the whole experience.  It's a failed attempt to be upscale that leaves you uncomfortable. Upscale places are suppose to make you feel comfortable, well served, happy, like you and your party are important, can have a private conversation, and like you never want to leave.  Portland's is none of those things.  There's too much competition downtown for this place to have those prices and not offer something plush.  I wouldn't mind paying more than here even if it was for something plush. But this isn't plush; it's absent any personality at all.  Portland's does not have comfortable seating, does not have relaxing music, does not have peaceful surroundings, does not have pleasant happy people hanging around, does not have a friendly happy smiling and attentive staff.  I don't care how good the food is if; I'm constantly aware that there are only two other parties in the whole restaurant and we can all hear each others conversations, the seating is uncomfortable, the staff disappears, or the wait for anything you order seems to take about 10 extra minutes than is acceptable (even drinks). The whole "I can't wait to leave" feeling stays right to the last minute, and getting the check and looking at the prices cause me I wish I would have went anywhere instead of Portlands. I walk past all the time.  A few times (when it was actually open), I stuck my head in the door and instantly went "oh, no, not this" and ended up walking over to Pita Jungle, or jumping on the light rail to go to CityScape, or getting in my car and driving anywhere else.

Average bar in Mill.  For it's theme, they do make a strong and sugar filled drink, so, I guess that's good if that's your thing.  Crowds, loud music are a norm on a weekend.  So, it's nothing special, true to it's theme, and good at what it's trying to do I guess, if your into that...

Staff is friendly, sushi is decent, location is pretty cool with both indoor and outdoor areas.  I prefer it to the other nearby sushi places when in this part of Scottsdale.

It's worth driving anywhere to get away from this store.  If you manage to get inside without someone asking you for money, the smell when you walk in is enough to knock you on your butt.  The neighborhood around here is slowly getting more affluent and proper, and this corner seems to be the escape/hangout of the trash of the neighborhood that has no where else to go.  Not only is it a place you don't feel safe, it's a place that smells horrible, and manages to make you wait in line 10-15 minutes if you are one of 1 or 15 people.

I had to write a review here, because I couldn't disagree more with what someone else said in their review, "You can expect Consistency and Good Service when you dine at Pita Jungle."  I live within a 5-minute walk of this location, and I've been there countless times so far in 2013.  Consistent is the last adjective that comes to mind when I think of this particular Pita Jungle.  So, I'm not sure it's possible to write an effective review of this place.  The service has ranged from annoyingly attentive to so neglectful you feel invisible when you're sitting at the bar 2 feet away from someone working there.  The kitchen can sometimes have your meal in 5 minutes, sometimes 50 minutes later you wonder if they even put in the order.  Sometimes it's extremely silent, sometimes the kitchen and staff are so loud you can get a headache even when there are only like 3 customers in the whole place.  The food is totally inconsistent also, and the garlic new potatoes come to mind as a good example.  I've had the garlic new potatoes as the side to a meal at least half a dozen times.  They have been absolutely mouthwatering perfection with perfectly cooked caramelized seasoning at times.  So perfect I was tempted to order two sides of the potatoes for desert.  However, once they were scorched on the outside and still a bit raw inside.  And the majority of the time they are generally just barely "cooked" (meaning not raw), but browned even slightly and totally bland and tasteless.  I could go on about a few other dishes, and about other service experiences.  But the point here is that this place is a gamble.  I only go now when I'm ready to risk it, or feeling lucky.  Occasionally it's amazing, sometimes it's completely disappointing and horrible, and a lot of the time it's just a mild let-down.  But consistent?   I don't know how many times the people who are writing those reviews have actually been to this location, but if they got consistency, they were really lucky.

Had breakfast on a Wednesday morning, and found it fairly decent.  This place is a "cafe" so I don't understand the reviews that complain about sushi or service at the bar, did it use to be a sushi bar?  Anyway, it seems to be a Cafe now, and breakfast wasn't bad.  Service was good, food was good, and prices and portions weren't bad.  It's an above average cafe for breakfast.  Not the best, but not bad.    I really can't comment on the Sushi or service at the bar, frankly it's not the kind of place I would go for Sushi or to hang out at the bar, so if that's what you're after, you probably get what you should expect.  But it's decent for breakfast.

I got asked for money 3 times by homeless people between the curb and the door. Once inside, the music was so loud, the staff was actually yelling to be heard and take an order. A bacon cheeseburger and drink (no fries) was $10.70, and was really bland. I don't understand how anyone likes this place or it stays in business.

Ok, Copper Blues isn't cheap dive bar, but it's worth it everything they charge, and worth leaving a decent tip!  The bartenders (and that is plural) are always alive and crazy busy trying to help you behind the bar.   They get you a drink if you can only squeeze an elbow in through a crowd.  But it does get crowded at times.  If you are at a table, the staff is still pretty decent, they get it.  They know it's a popular and busy place, and they try to keep up.  At least of spring 2013, the staff and service makes it worth going to on a Friday or Saturday night. They make you feel like you matter.  I can't say it's the cheapest place, or best food.  But, the selection of beer and the service makes it worth spending some money there, if you have it to spend.

The food isn't bad (usually), and they have a decent selection of beers.  But I was expecting (based on the website and pictures) a really hot staff.  It is NOT.  This place might be amazing if you are a woman, I wouldn't know, but I hear the hot guys in kilts there can't be beat anywhere downtown?  Maybe the place to take your BF to show him you're open minded, while drooling over the bartender? The guys In kilts are friendly, cool, and make me feel a bit like I need to get to the gym.  Honestly, it's probably better for women than men, because the guys on staff are good looking built enough to make me extremely jealous. The female staff is about what you would expect at a out of the way Hooters in the middle of nowhere or something, only with more tattoos.  They are in the "decent, but debatable if I'd even date that" category.  The food is debatable.  It's a traditional UK'ish menu, which isn't a bad thing.  But it depends on how it's prepared, so when the right cook is working it's brilliant, and worth every penny.  When the wrong cook is working, it might as well be microwaved frozen food.  Honestly, if you at CityScape already and are a guy just looking to see hot staff, you are probably better off at Copper Blues or Gypsy Bar.   But, the female staff is friendlier at the other bars in CityScape.  At Tilted Kilt the female staff sort of act like they hate the fact they are wearing those outfits and hate the fact they have to serve you.  Not a good thing for a theme restaurant.

Yelp ratings and reviews really let me down with what to expect from this place.  I'm going to give it a 2 star rating; it's a below average sandwich shop, and they don't have cheesesteaks.  My first impulse was to give it a 1 star, because zero wasn't available, and it was the worst cheesesteak I've ever eaten.  I have had all kinds from around New York, New Jersey, and Philly.  Philly's Best on Central here in Phoenix makes a passable cheesesteak, not the greatest, but at least you can tell what it's suppose to be. Then I realized Phoenix Cheesesteak Factory doesn't make cheesesteaks.  Anyone can Google and confirm, it's obvious by looking at the sandwich it's not a cheesesteak.  And if anyone has ever tasted a real Philly cheesesteak, it's unquestionable that this is nothing like a cheesesteak.    Two of the three main ingredients are not in this creation.  They use flavored cheese (like southwest flavor in cheese, not cheese flavor).  You can opt for what I believe is generic Cheez Wiz, but they don't use the brand name.  And the meat wasn't what you are suppose to put in a cheesesteak.  You can't substitute something completely and call it the same thing.  "Can I have a Rum and Coke, but with Sprite and Vodka please? And an eggless omelete please."   To be honest, I was so distracted by the horrible meat that I didn't even notice if they actually used Amoroso or Vilotti-Pisanelli rolls like they should have.  Most important in a cheesesteak is the super-thin sliced meat that is fried and browned perfectly to give that magical amazing cheesesteak flavor and texture was NOT anywhere to be found in this restaurant.   Instead there were big thick hunks for something, sorta grayed, that looked like how you chop up meat to feed to your dog.  Saying the creation by Phoenix Cheesesteak Company is a "Philly cheesesteak" is like throwing sun-dried tomatoes and a slice of American cheese on a tortilla and calling it "Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza."  The choice of ingredients, and every step of the preparation is important in how food tastes.  That's why baked potatoes are different than mashed potatoes, ground chuck is different than new york strip.  All this is lost on the majority of Phoenix, or at least the Yelp reviewers here who seem to say it's the best Philly cheesesteak they ever had.   Then, they take it a step further, and they season the meat excessively.  The reviews here brag about the "range of sauces" and green chilies, jalapeños, and avocado. Clearly you are talking about a sandwich, maybe some sort of hoagie.  But that's not a cheesesteak.   What they make at Phoenix Cheesesteak Company is a sandwich of some sort, with cheese on it, and some meat on a long bun.  That alone does not make it a cheesesteak. Not all meat and cheese on a long bun are cheesesteaks.  Calling that sandwich a cheesesteak was like using sliced tomatoes instead of tomato paste for a slice of New York Pizza (which is very different than Chicago Deep Dish, BTW).  You can argue all day about if it's better or worse, but you can't even begin to pretend they are the same thing.   Even for whatever it was, it was disgusting.  The meat was gristly and had hunks of fat I had to spit out. At least the "plain" one I had was covered with enough seasoning that it tasted like it was freezer burn meat that someone was trying to use jalapeno and chili to hide the taste of the meat gone bad.  I'm not sure what the seasoning was, but whatever it was I had an allergic reaction or something and had extensive ulcers on my tongue before my third bites, but I've never had big sore circles like that on my tongue before. I ended up throwing whatever that sandwich was into the trash, then had to smell the disgusting thing for an hour by my desk until I decide I'd take the trash out to the dumpster to get rid of the smell.  But in the end it was the name of the thing I ordered, and the name of place itself that were totally misleading.  It's not a "cheesesteak company, in Phoenix" at all.  It's a place that has invented something they call the "Phoenix Cheesesteak" that bears very little resemblance to Philly cheesesteak.  If you don't know what a cheesesteak is suppose to be like, maybe think about craving McDonalds french-fries with your Big Mac, and having someone serve you over-seasoned home fries instead, sure, it's a fried potato, but it's not french-fries.  What's next "Phoenix Burger Company" that only serves fish and sliced beef, but no ground beef?

Cheap place, in all the best ways you can read cheap.  Cheap beer, not good beer, but not bad, and not even slightly expensive ($2 drafts).  AMAZING BBQ that won't break the bank, the pulled pork and brisket are both well worth trying! Two people in, couple beers, couple 1/2 pound sandwiches of amazing bbq, and out the door for $16?  VERY worthwhile.  Ambiance?  Not really any, it's a BBQ joint, that caters to a college crowd.  They do that about right, so it's great for a single guy to pop in for beers and food, but not a place to take a date if you want to impress her, (unless she's impressed with good food and cheap beer, in that case, she's a keeper ;-).  For what it is, it's 4 stars!    If you expect always be clean tables and elegant staff, then, you just don't understand BBQ joints, and you have no business rating this place anyway!  And if you complain it's "greasy" or "sloppy" and gave it a low rating, you have no business rating a BBQ joint.  For quality of meat, 5 stars.  For "what a guy expects" at a BBQ joint in terms of staff, meat, beer, prices, TOTALLY 5 stars.  But, every time I've been, it was cheap buns.  Amazing meat, cheap beer, on cold soggy buns that might as well have been wunderbread.  So, that's a fail.  Given how good everything else was, I am only going down to 4 stars.  But if they got some decent fresh buns in, it has potential to be the best BBQ joint in the whole Phoenix metro area.  Fresh cooked soft rich buns that are on par with the meat, it would be perfect.  But putting that stuff on cheap buns... sorry, you probably should loose 2 stars, not just one.  But for cheep beer and good food, in this location (Mill Ave.) known for  middle of the road prices and middle of the road food, The Beach Pit is better food and cheaper prices than the rest.  So, I am NOT subtracting points for an occasional sticky table and the lack of waitresses in bikinis... it's a dive with good food and cheap beer, and a 4 star for what it does.  With better buns, and a slightly better beer selection, this would be 5 star amazing.

The food was great, the drinks were great. The staff was very friendly. One night there was a little trouble with our reservation, but after discussing it, the staff corrected the situation quickly.

Nice local bar for being "local" to people in the building, with very friendly staff and good service.  The bar part was a bit small, with people at tables that probably would have rather just sat at the bar.  Prices were fairly extreme.  I went in with a friend, we had 1 beer each, and no food, and got $16.50 bill.  For 2 people having 2 draft beers after work on Friday evening before going out, was excessive.  Won't be back based on price alone.  Was "nice" but not THAT nice.
