If Pizzeria Bianco is so ballyhooed about that it has an almost mythic status... then Pane Bianco could almost be seen as the less famous step-child of the family. Here is an analogy for you... I hope you remember how these work from your high school days:  Alec Baldwin is to Stephen Baldwin as Pizzeria Bianco is to ______?  ...how did you do?   If you filled in the blank with "Pane Bianco", then congratulations... give yourself a pat on the back and 3 extra credit points.   Just a hop, skip and a jump north of downtown Phoenix lies this little unassuming storefront. If you didn't know any better, you'd never guess that some of tastiest sandwiches in the valley are being cooked up inside. Similar to Pizzeria Bianco, there is a focus on fresh local ingredients and simplicity. Don't expect a dazzling and varied menu, but do expect a small selection of sandwiches which they really know how to cook well. I always love it when a place has a small menu of things that they do great, rather than an extensive menu of things they do just OK.   Last time we went, we were able to get one of each sandwich on the menu (it's not as impressive as it sounds... they only have three sandwiches along with one rotating special). Each one had unique flavor and tasted really fresh.... our favorite might be the simplest one they have; the mozzarella/tomato/basil sandwich... yum yum. They have a way of always cooking the bread perfectly, so it has this slightly burnt crisp to it; it's almost like you're eating a sandwich made out of really good pizza crust.  There's really not too much bad to say about this place, they serve great fresh sandwiches for a pretty reasonable price. If you do go though, there is occasionally a little bit of a wait... and it's strictly a 'to-go' place, so there's no indoor seating (there are picnic tables outside in the front). If you do have a little wait time to get your food, be sure to go next door to Lux where you can get a pretty good cup of coffee/tea and laugh at the sheer volume of trendy hipsters completely enamored in their MacBooks.   4.25/5.

OMFG we love this place!   Eating here reminds me of eating at some little cafe on state street in Santa Barbara. It's quiet and quaint and has a very local down to earth vibe. Sure, the parking is a bit tight, but there is plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood and we didn't mind walking for a few minutes from our car on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.   The breakfast menu is reasonable and the food is worth every penny and then some. We tried the french pancakes (crepes) with fresh fruit and the croque madame and the Venice beach burrito. All were exceptional and left us wanting more. Before we had finished our meal, we were planning our next trip to La Grand Orange.   The grocery store inside is cute and has fun trinkets and specialty sauces and food that a lot of people were buying. Although it was bustling with business, there was plenty of seating outside in the garden area, which was perfect on such a beautiful afternoon.   And one final note....if/when you do visit this place, you MUST MUST MUST try their famous home made english muffins! Ohhhh, they are good! We tried one and ended up buying a whole pack of them before we left. It's like nothing that you have ever bought in the store, and once you try them you will be hooked!  We can't wait to go back again soon!

Now, I'm not the type of person who reads science fiction novels or plays Dungeons and Dragons or who can build a computer from scratch blindfolded with one hand. And I'm definitely not the type of person who plays laser tag with a group of strangers on a Saturday night.....or am I?!?. The boyfriend and I decided to do something out of the ordinary for us and play a game of laser tag at Laser Quest this past weekend. We opted for the half hour Ironman session for $12 bucks each so that we would get our fix and not leave wanting to play more. At first we weren't sure if anyone was going to join us in the game, since we were the only ones sitting there at a quarter to nine, but finally a few nerds showed up at the last minute and they were ready to tag...laser tag that is. It was clear from the very beginning that these were not the type of people who played for fun. No, these were the type of people that have VIP memberships and practice their moves at home beforehand and will gang up on any innocent looking novice so that they can get the most points possible because God forbid they don't impress their other nerdy laser tag friends. These nerds meant business.   I think it's pretty apparent by now that we got our asses kicked....bad. We even got nailed by a six year old punk named Mr.Lego. But, I will say that even though we came out with negative points, it was still a fun experience that we got a lot of good laughs out of on the ride back home. And not to mention a good workout! Just be warned that there are competitive laser tager's out there and they have no mercy...so you might want to think twice before going if you're just going for a low key afternoon. Will we go play laser tag again? Probably not. But for what is...a laser tag amusement park...it does deliver a nice facility with friendly staff and plenty of room to run around...the perfect place for kids and nerds alike. To bad we don't fit into either of those categories.

Why review Blockbuster?  ...I've been a Netflix member for about ten years now (8 out at a time...movie geek here). So, why take the time to review this infamous struggling movie rental giant? Well...because there are still people renting here, and the few people that are left need to know how shitty this place is, and more importantly what they are missing out on.   First, let me just preface this by saying that I've probably been to Blockbuster more than the average folk. Growing up it was the main place we rented, then as I got older I'd do their Rewards program and monthly rental deals where they'd allow you to have unlimited in store rentals for a monthly fee...recently I even tried their online service just to see what it was all about. I say all this because I feel like this qualifies me to give Blockbuster one star.   Where to begin? I'm just gonna start listing stuff off here, because there are too many to discuss in a readable paragraph, and I may miss some points here...  -Selection. Blockbuster continues to disappoint when it comes to selection of independent and foreign films. The few that they do have seem to be rarely available. I know some people aren't into the lesser known titles, but for many people including me this is big time deal breaker. A vast majority of the lesser known titles that I'm interested in are only available on Netflix or an independently owned stores (like DVD Paradise in Chandler).  -Customer Service. Blockbuster fails here big time...I've been to multiple locations including this one, and have been seriously underwhelmed. Just as an example...I went to rent the TV series 'OZ' there quite a while ago, and one of the employees gave away an important plot point from a future season which I was not on yet. It should have been obvious by me renting season 2, that I wasn't up to date with the show. NOT COOL.   -Price. Big time fail. They keep jacking up their prices for in store rentals. Why would I go here when I can get a great deal on Netflix for unlimited rentals and unlimited online streaming? It just doesn't make any sense.   -Online Service. Blockbusters online rental service is an utter joke. It started off as a great deal because you could exchange your online movies for free rentals in store. Regardless of this, the selection of movies online was extremely lacking. Many lesser known and even popular titles would stay on "Very long wait" for weeks or even months. In fact for the four months or so that I tried their online service I had about half of my queue in various stages of being unavailable. It got to the point where I was throwing in movies I wasn't going to even watch so that I could use them for free in store exchanges. Then they got rid of free in store exchanges, and there was zero reason to even consider signing up for their online service.   -"Blockbuster Exclusives". Generally these titles are straight to video stinkers that no self respecting person would waste money on. If you want to spend your time watching Weekend at Bernies 9 starring Cory Feldman or Scorpion King 4: The Uprising starring Tom Selleck...then be my guest; me personally...I'd rather die.  ...so basically what I'm trying to say is that Blockbuster's time is done. It sucks. Blockbuster is like an old boxer who is way past his prime...trying to step back into the ring to make a paycheck so he can pay his child support. Netflix is the young and fresh champion who respects the crowd and scores an easy first round knockout. You can't help but feel a bit bad for Blockbuster, but it has no one to blame but itself. They didn't evolve to consumer needs, while other companies did. Now they are barely surviving with a faint heartbeat, trying to stay afloat by basically copycating other services (like Redbox). They thought they were invisible because they had the market cornered for so long...I guess this is a lesson to what can happen when a business gets cocky.

You just gotta love Lee Lee's. Are you a fan of the 'ethnic' aisle in your local grocery store? If you are... even a little bit, then you should run to Lee Lee's right now; you'll have a blast. Lee Lee's is basically a giant ethnic supermarket... except unlike many of the smaller ones scattered randomly around town, it's clean and well managed. Aisles and aisles of stuff you've most likely never seen before await you.   As far as size goes, it's about as big as your average Fry's or Safeway and includes a restaurant, a mini gift store, and pretty much every department you'd come to expect in a normal grocery store. It's kind of fun walking in, on occasion I've felt like I was one of the only English speaking people in the place... which is kind of nice; helps me feel like I'm not in Arizona for a split second.   My favorite thing to do here is simply 'browse'. I usually end up buying just a handful of stuff, but I could spend hours simply going up and down each aisle and picking up random stuff to look at. It really is fun to see so many imported and unusual items... for example last time I went I ended up leaving with a bag full of imported Chinese candy, some weird noodles that I'd never heard of before, and some odd imported fruit. I ended up discovering a couple gems in my random selections.   The only possible downside for some people is the fish smell... they have a giant fish and meat section here; so by default the store occasionally has just a little bit of a fishy smell in some areas... despite this it's always clean and well kept, so this is a minor gripe and comes with the territory for having such an extensive fish market. Most people should love this place though... unless you're the type of person who doesn't like to experiment at all with food, then I wholeheartedly recommend a trip to Lee Lee's. You'll more than likely find some stuff that piques your interest, or at the very least you'll have a good time browsing through things you won't see at any other store in AZ.

Abuelos is a solid 3.5 star place, that I'll kindly round up to 4 stars due to the consistency I've experienced with the food and service over the past few years.   Abuelos is one of those chains, that if you didn't specifically tell me I probably wouldn't know it was a chain. They serve a little bit higher end Mexican food... kind of like if Garcia's had a wealthier older brother. The decor is really nice and inviting... complete with the vaulted and painted ceilings, which I'm always a sucker for (I know, I'm easy to please).   The food isn't an A+... it's more like a solid B, but it's a consistent B. There are a couple of dishes that I get on a regular basis. One is the steak & enchiladas, and the other is called "Mis Abuelos Manjar". The steak here is suprisingly good for a Mexican place... actually it's one of the more reliable places to go get a good and affordable cut of meat. Mis Abuelos Manjar is basically a couple of enchiladas which are smothered in sauce then topped with two eggs; pretty tasty. Also, I gotta throw a shot out to the roasted salsa they serve; you have to specifically ask for it; it's served warm and it's oh so good.   I've never left Abuelos and thought I'd had the best meal of my life, but every time I go, I leave full and glad I made the choice to go there.   As a sidenote, if you go to this Chandler location, ask for Theresa... she's a fun waitress.   3.5/5.

I really want to like this place.  I've been here a few times for lunch in the past year and each time I've left feeling a bit underwhelmed.  The atmosphere is great; you feel like you've stepped back into the nineties and Phoebe and Rachael might just be at the next table.  It's definitely got a comfortable coffee house vibe with a nice mix of tables and lounge space which makes for a great casual lunch or meeting place.  The food however, leaves much to be desired.    The menu is expansive, offering breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads, pastries and they even have a juice bar in addition to the coffee.  Unfortunately, the sandwiches that I've had have all been mediocre at best.  My turkey veggie the other day consisted of a completely brown slice of avocado hidden between a clump of your typical grocery store processed turkey.  After I peeled the aged avocado off of the bread, it was edible but it was so very typical and blah that it made me wonder why I paid almost $10 for half a sandwich and a bag of chips.  My past trips have yielded similar disappointing results, with most of my lunch remaining untouched on the table.    I wish I could say the coffee was amazing and made up for the lackluster food, but the lattes I've had have made me wonder why I keep coming back.  It's just too bad that a local coffee shop like this can't step up their game a bit and really blow the competition out of the water by being the complete package.  Maybe they need to offer less food options and get rid of the juice bar and focus on improving a few choice menu items to create some renewed interest.  Until they start doing something different, I have to say I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.

I live right across the street from this Jiffy Lube, and have been there quite a few times with my car. As a girl, I usually am very hesitant to go anywhere near car dealerships or mechanics or anyone who has to deal with my car for fear that they will try to up sell me on stupid bullshit I don't need or scare me into buying some completely useless crap. Having said that, I was relieved to find out that that is not the case at this Jiffy Lube. The guys are all burly men, but they are decent and friendly and always do a good job. I would definitely reccommend going here for an oil change if you just want to get it done quickly and get on with your life.

Never been to Cuba... probably don't ever wanna go to Cuba... so I don't know why such an intense craving to try Cuban food came over us on a random Friday night; but it did. Enter Havanna Café... the best/most reviewed Cuban place on Yelp in the greater Phoenix area.   We went to the Scottsdale location which is nestled in a random little strip mall... if you didn't know any better you'd probably assume it's some no frills neighborhood diner, but how wrong you'd be... just beyond those stucco walls is a nice quaint Cuban restaurant with dozens upon dozens of dishes most people have never even heard of before.   We were sat down right next to a live Cuban band... bongo drums and all... they were belting out some pretty groovy tunes. The main singer had a deep scratchy voice and a heavy Cuban accent... and he said 'wooooooooooow' a lot... this combined with the décor of the place really did make it feel like you were really in Cuba, very fun! We decided to order a schmorgisborg of stuff... what follows is a list of what we got along with a brief description:  Calypso Chips - Fried Plantains w/ black bean dip... damn good... good chips and salsa alternative.   Frituras de Frijoles Negros - Deep fried balls of black beans w/ avocado dip... heavenly.  Dátiles con Chorizo - Chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon... very unique flavor.  Papa Rellena - Meat stuffed in a ball of fried potatoes in a bed of cream sauce... pretty decent though a bit rich.   Tamal Cubano - A Cuban ground corn tamale with pork and other random goodness, it was alright but not quite good enough to specifically recommend.    Potage de Frijoles Negros - A black bean soup... a little too 'beany' if that makes any sense. Made a good dip for the black bean balls though.   On top of all that we tried a couple of imported Cuban sodas... both were pretty different, but tasted great. The meal was very fun... flavors were all over the place; if you're a fan of trying new things then this should be high on your list. The Tapas section of the appetizer is quite extensive and you can easily make a fun and varied meal by getting nothing but appetizers.   This place is easily recommendable for any of the more adventurous foodies out there; you'll have a lot of fun at this place trying some new things. For us, this place was more of a novelty, to try once just for the experience... but depending on your pallet I could see this place swooping in a stealing a lot of business from other more bland Mexican and ethnic restaurants nearby.  4/5.

What a nice little place for breakfast! The boy and I made our first trip over to Dragonfly Cafe for our usual late Sunday morning breakfast (2:30ish by the time we got there) and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was. The place is cute as a button inside and out with a quaint down home cozy atmosphere that you just don't get from a national chain restaurant. Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to try as so many things looked good. We finally decided on the daybreak breakfast sandwich and the cinnamon raisin french toast, and boy oh boy were they good! The sandwich was so fresh tasting and they must have picked the onions that day, because they were so flavorful and perfect in the sandwich. The potatoes that came on the side also had a nice flavorful garlicy taste to them and the french toast was pretty darn good too! And the best part of all is that they serve breakfast all day every day (except Monday's) so I know for sure that we will be back soon to sample more of this tasty menu at the Dragonfly Cafe!

Normally, I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's. We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is, and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub. Well, having said this, the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago.   First, shame on us for resorting to eating here, but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home. There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had, I just remember that it wasn't that great. I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of.   The real reason that I am writing however, is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food). My boy and I were cuddling in a booth, his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh. We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly, nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me. We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says, "How's the dessert, let's keep it a family restaurant". Before we could even respond, he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes. We couldn't figure out what we had done, and the more we thought about it the madder we got. It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant. We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert. We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table. We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time. If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's, then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again!  Keep it a family restaurant my ass, there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale!

I'd be very happy if every theater in town was like Shea 14. They show the big name movies but also show a nice variety of foreign and independent stuff as well. It's sort of like Camelview 5 but slightly more accessible to the masses.   You can expect a slightly more old school vibe here. That means non-stadium seating and smaller screens than your average theater (although this place still has a few larger screens which they use for the big movies each week).  If you plan on seeing a lesser known movie here, you can expect to be in one of their much smaller screening rooms.There's just something charming about seeing a film in a room that only has 50 or so seats...especially after going to something like the Cine Capri where you're packed in with hundreds upon hundreds of people. Here are a few advantages of seeing a movie at an old school venue like Shea 14:  -Lower chances of encountering rude and inconsiderate moviegoers.  -Less bodies = Less body heat = no swamp ass when leaving the theater in those summer months.  -Smaller screens have their own unique visual experience when compared with much larger screens. I tend to notice the clarity of the picture is a bit better when viewed on a slighly smaller screen like they have here.  The theater is clean and the staff are friendly. I've yet to have a bad experience seeing a movie here. Additionally, they tend to be really good at having a nice volume level for all the screens. I've had horrible luck at various AMC theaters with the volume being much too quiet. Call me a movie snob, but volume issues can completely ruin a movie experience (Too loud, too quiet, music/effects make dialogue hard to hear, etc). Having nice crisp and clear audio is essential. Harkins theaters tends to be really good at this, and it's no different here.  If I had to pick a 'desert island' movie theater here in the valley, Shea 14 would be it. Mainstream, indie, foreign, documentaries...there's a nice mix of everything here. I Highly recommend considering this place for your next flick if you live in the area.   4.5/5.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Back when it first opened Arizona Mills was fun and exciting. Not to be cliche, but for it's first year or so it really was the talk of the town when it comes to shopping malls. It was a place you could go to find great deals and stores that weren't at any other local malls. Something about the place was just fun.   Fast forward about ten years... oh lordy, what happened?! Slowly but surely this mall has taken a nose dive. To put it bluntly, this mall has transformed into nothing more than a gang hang out. Almost all of the stores that made this place interesting at one point in time have closed and been replaced with an alarming number of urban clothing stores. The few decent stores that are left seem to be closing or on their way out in some way... it all just has this very 'bargain bin' type of feel now.   This place is officially in the process of biting the dust in my opinion. Even if they open up new stores or try to revitalize it, it's just not fun going to a mall where you barely even feel safe. Sad to say... but you've lost your edge AZ Mills. 2/5.

Look...I'm sorry...but I just don't get it. I like water, I like nature, intertubes are A-Ok in my book...so why do I loath this place. Well...here are a few reasons why:  -Drunk Assholes...everywhere. I can't stand annoying drunk people, and this place is a mecca for it. Whether it's the overweight frat guy or the backwoods overly-tanned middle aged yokul...everyone is drunk; and everyone is f*cking annoying as all hell.  -Dirty Water. I mean...seriously, I couldn't wait to take a bath once I left. Someone else in another review talked about getting a band-aid that was floating in the water stuck to them...doesn't surprise me.  -Getting burnt. I don't care what anyone says...you can slather on SPF -1000 sunscreen every five minutes...you're gonna leave here hurting. Blistering summertime heat in AZ...floating down a river for hours and hours...common sense says this just isn't a great idea.   -Scratching your ass on rocks. If you've been there you know about this...sometimes while floating, the water level gets a little low and you have to really make an effort to lift your ass out of the middle of the intertube to avoid jagged rocks beneath...or else pain awaits...if you don't heed this advice...sorry...you're leaving with a bloody asshole that day.   Well...I could keep going here...  Bottom Line: Just go to Sunsplash or Waterworld for God's sake...this place is not worth the hassle. The Lazy River at any waterpark completely OWNS this experience in my opinion.

The Breakfast Club is awesome. It's one in a handful of trendy little breakfast spots in the Scottsdale area. It's located right on the north end of Old Town, the area is really chill and perfect for lounging on a nice day. So if there's a wait, which there usually is... it's not a nuisance to hang out; it's a pleasure!   Like a lot of Old Town Scottsdale places, there is a certain hipster vibe you get from this place. If you go for a later breakfast like we usually do, you'll most certainly notice that about three fourths of the people eating there are club-goers from the previous night that went to bed way too late and drank too much while partying. Most of them look like they have not showered since getting home the previous night, and smell like a ridiculous mixture of B.O. and cheap cologne. Not exactly our crowd, but it does make for some fun people watching.   They have a lot of dishes that are more on the adventurous side of the breakfast spectrum, but also have all the tried and true's as well. We opted with the cinnamon challah french toast which was very good and an omelet which we just loaded with all sorts of good shit... it was also quite yummy. It's also cool that there is a little coffee bar inside that you can order from while you wait or get stuff from to accompany your meal.   All in all, we quite enjoyed The Breakfast Club... it's just a fun and chill little spot to grab a fresh and tasty morning treat.

Julio G's resides at the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to Mexican food in the valley. From the outside the bright and vividly colored building might make you think that it's some tasty independently owned hole in the wall, but don't fall for the mirage... you're walking into a dungeon of greasy food and bad service.   It took about five minutes to completely be turned off by this place. We sat down and were greeted by what had to be one of the most disinterested waitresses I've ever had. She had this vibe going that made us feel like we were inconveniencing her just by being there... her non-descript facial expression and attitude were overshadowed only by her terrible service; which could best be described as 'going through the motions' (even that is giving her too much credit though). Opening the menu yielded even more dissatisfaction... the menu itself was drab and gimmicky and was full of unflattering pictures of the food; making it feel like a chore to even pick out something that looked appetizing. One thing I noticed immediately that should have been a red flag was that for all of their chicken dishes, they charged about three dollars extra for white meat... that's never a good sign.   We eventually settled on a chorizo breakfast quesadilla and their sampler platter which included one of just about everything on the menu. The breakfast quesadilla was massive... it must've weighed about three pounds, the taste was okay but it was dripping with grease and after just a few bites it was hard to stomach any more of it. Our other dish; the sampler platter could best be described as a plate of hot garbage. The assortment of food was thrown on the plate and absolutely smothered with cheese... way too much cheese; in fact the plate itself was literally swimming in cheese which almost seemed to be liquefied... more than likely just an artery clogging mixture of melted cheese and grease. The meal was such a grease bomb that we probably ate about 20 percent of it, yet we felt like our stomachs were going to explode when we were done. There is that nice full feeling you get after you eat a well made meal at a good restaurant, then there is that feeling you get after you eat something like Julio G's; that feeling can best be described as 'Where's the toilet?'. To wrap up the lovely meal, the waitress messed up the bill and charged us for both of our drinks even though one of them should have came free with our breakfast quesadilla. At that point though, it was a mute point and we didn't have the energy or patience to try and explain what had happened to her, at risk of causing her brain to short circuit.   This is a place I can firmly say I won't be returning to under any circumstance. Julio G's is a poster child for everything a restaurant should NOT be. Bland and boring greasy food, huge portions but zero quality, and a wait staff that you'd swear just woke up from a long nap. To top it all off, the prices are a tad steep for a Mexican restaurant... so basically there's no reason at all to ever try this place. You've been warned... bleh.

This is one of the many trendy little hot spots in the Old Town Scottsdale area. We came here for a late breakfast one fine Saturday afternoon. Luckily, maybe because it was late there wasn't a wait at all. We were able to get a nice little seat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the weather and do some good people watching.   I will admit that some other reviewers are right... the service here isn't amazing. Our server seemed very rushed and distracted, but at no point in time during our meal was she bad enough to really make us take notice. At some point in time... you realize that these waitresses are more trendy than professional, so if you can enjoy your breakfast knowing that you aren't going to get the best service of your life, you'll have fun. The best way I could describe it, would be like you are getting waited on by a less mature younger sibling. They may not be doing the best job... but they mean well. If you're the type of person that demands impeccable service, this could very well be a deal breaker.   The food here is fresh and flavorful... the dishes match the independent vibe of the building and staff very well. The standouts for us were the "Monkey Cakes" which were very nicely cooked pancakes with bananas and slivered almonds in the batter, very yummy! By all means, I recommend this place to 9/10 people. If you're comfortable in this yuppie type of environment you'll more than likely enjoy it. We'll probably be back some time to try more, or maybe even give their lunch/dinner menu a go.

Going firmly against the practices and beliefs of one Walter Sobchak, we recently went bowling on Shabbos (Saturday) the Jewish day of rest. No we are not Jewish...repeated viewing of The Big Lebowski is required to understand this reference.  This AMF location claims they offer "a new upscale spin on bowling in Scottsdale" on their website. Upscale and bowling aren't usually two words used in the same sentence most days, so I was intrigued. Without some sort of 'group special', bowling can get pretty pricey if you pay by the game...so we (group of six of us) decided to go for the 2 hour group pass they offer. This got us shoe rentals, two hours of bowling, drinks and a large pizza for six people...all this was just a little bit more than seventy bucks; if you divide that amongst every person in the group; it's a pretty good deal.   I don't know about 'upscale'...but the lanes were clean and seemed newly remodeled...we couldn't have asked for more from the bowling experience itself. MPH indicators were a nice little addition...and made it possible for my brother and I to have a ridiculously competitive challenge against each other to see who could throw a bowling ball the fastest. I was shocked that there was zero need to ever reset the pins or retrieve a lost ball...maybe I'm used to bowling at ghetto lanes, but I've never had two hours of bowling go this flawless before...I guess they've come a long way with 'Bowling alley technology".   Even though the bowling aspect was great...just to give the full picture...the food wasn't exactly stellar; but if we hadn't got the pizza for free we wouldn't have resorted to eating bowling alley food anyway. I do kind of wish they offered a package without the necessity of buying food and drinks, and knocked a few bucks off the group price in return. Seems kind of like they're punishing you with the obligatory pizza because they know most people wouldn't buy one if given the choice (The pizza which I didn't even try, tasted like soggy cardboard according to my Dad).   After a fun afternoon of bowling...and handing my little brother his ass on the lanes (that's right Chris...family high score still belongs to this guy right here)...I left this bowling alley wondering why I don't bowl more often. It's a nice way to relax and stay active at the same time, and what's more fun that bowling with a group of friends and/or family? Not much. Next time you get the random hankering to throw some gutter balls, you can't do much better than these lanes.   P.S. They have a really nice rug in the entrance to this place too...really ties the room together.   4/5.

Well well well, the mighty fork has roared!   We had never been here before, but we thought we would try it out for Valentines Day since it was nicer than your average restaurant, but still not too dressy or formal. The whole staff was impeccable, they handed out roses to the ladies as they walked in and the manager and assistant manager went around the restaurant asking people how their meal was and if everything was okay.   Okay, now on to the food! We decided to try the prime rib and Dr. Pepper baby back ribs for our main course and we also got a side of green chili mac and cheese, which we had heard rave reviews about. The prime rib was so tender and juicy and the baby back ribs were sweet and meaty. The ribs came with fries that were nice and crispy and the green chili mac was so tasty and flavorful, definitely a must try. We usually don't finish all of our food when we go out, but the meal was so delicious that we finished every bite on our plates and even licked our fingers clean when we were done! We even managed to stuff down some Huckleberry bread pudding for dessert that was just as amazing as the rest of the meal. I know that we will definitely be coming back here again to try some of the other items on the menu.   4.75/5

Grimaldi's is the most consistently amazing pizza place in Arizona. We've been to this Old Town location quite a few times in the past year and not once have we had a bad pie. The pizza is always uber-fresh with crispy crust and amazing flavor.   We've never had any issues with the wait staff, they're attentive and generally on top of things... but to be honest, even if the wait staff here was horrible, I'd still give the place 5 stars because the pizza is that good. I think they put crack in that dough, because I'm addicted. 5/5 stars.

After reading some glowing reviews of Bandera (specifically of their 'best on the planet' cornbread) here on Yelp, Krashawnda just had to try the place. We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that.   The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping.   Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while.   To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience.   From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shot

The Pizzeria Bianco Date Night:  If you're gonna show up at Pizzeria Bianco and wait for hours upon hours anyway...might as well make a nice day out of it. Bring the following things:  -Reusable cloth grocery bag -Large blanket/beach towels -Playing cards and/or board games -Disposable ice chest (if you don't want to buy beer/beverages from Bar Bianco) -Sunscreen -Frisbee (optional)  There are ample patches and hills of nice soft green grass in and around heritage square...absolutely perfect spots for a makeshift picnic. Pack everything in the cloth bag and show up to PB around 4:30 or so. You'll have to stand in line for a few minutes to put your name in...but once you do...it's Picnic time!   Find a nice shaded grassy hill...there's a quite ideal one over towards the Science Center. Lay out your towels and make a fun evening of it. You can relax with some beverages while playing cards with your significant other and as a nice side effect the people watching can be pretty great while you do so. By doing this, you're really killing two birds with one stone...you're getting to have a nice picnic...and as a side effect...you're negating the whole negative aspect of going to Pizzeria Bianco...the wait. Once your name gets called you simply toss everything back in the bag, throw the disposable cooler out...and voila...you're ready to have some great pizza in a cozy rustic pizza joint after your picnic.   I really don't see why you'd want to do anything else...it's making the best of a less than ideal situation. Each time I go there I see people lethargically pacing around with a beer, bored out of their gourd...I just don't get it...might as well try and have some fun.   Now on to Pizzeria Bianco itself...I didn't feel the need to really add too much content about the place itself, because what's already been said by the 300+ reviews is more than sufficient. I will say this...the pizza is great, but it's not all that different than pizza you can get at Cibo for example, where the wait is almost non-existent. What Pizzeria Bianco is, however...is a dining experience every Phoenix foodie must check off their bucket list at least one time.   4/5.

We thought we would see this show since it was more on the 'adult' side than the other shows, and it was reasonably priced compared to the other Cirque shows in Vegas. (And, FYI if you do go to Vegas to see these shows, never buy your tickets online, you should buy them a few days before or the day of the show at Tix 4 Tonight, which is located at various hotels in Vegas and offers significant discounts on all the popular shows). Just had to throw out a quick plug...   Zumanity was a very tasteful, artistic and colorful show with lots of sexuality to go around. Although everyone was prancing around topless and half naked for most of the show, you almost forget that they are not wearing clothes because you are so focused on the incredible things that they are doing with their bodies. A few of the highlights for us were the two girls in the fishbowl who were doing this very intense routine in the water, and the fabio looking guy who does this strip tease and gets completely naked (but is surrounded by women so you don't see his pee-pee). It was just a fun show all around, and there was also a comedic relief type of duo that opened the show and would do silly skits in between the performances. I probably could have done without that and had more performances, but it was a nice touch and it was pretty entertaining. If you are thinking about sitting in the front few rows, just be aware that they do pull a few people up and embarrass you quite a bit, so either have a good sense of humor and sit up there, or buy the cheap seats and sit in the balcony!  All in all though, it was very impressive and left us wanting to come back to Las Vegas so that we can see all of the other Cirque shows too!

Randomly stumbled across the Greene House while Yelping the other night. We couldn't figure out where to go for the night, so while browsing we came across this place and the decent reviews led us to go ahead and give it a shot.   It was a chilly Arizona winter night... but indoor seating was full, so we opted to sit out on their heated patio. When they say 'heated' patio, they aren't kidding... it was toasty out there! In fact the first table we got seated at was so hot we had to move, we were getting a little sweaty after just a few minutes and it was probably in the low 50's outside... so yeah; they have some pretty powerful heaters. Once we moved tables, it was quite relaxing and chill... this place just has a real nice relaxing vibe to it. That, and you can people watch all the yuppies shopping at Kierland as you eat, which is always fun.   We decided on the twin Kobe Burgers (with white truffle and rosemary fries) and the BBQ Pork Tenderloin. While we waited they brought some bread that was pretty tasty. The twin Kobe Burgers came and looked oh so good. The first bite into those things was like heaven in a bun... literally melt in your mouth good. Juicy and flavorful, and they went perfect with the crunchy fries. The Tenderloin was equally yummy... great sauce and crispy around the edges but soft inside; perfectly cooked in my opinion.   Our waiter was also great... very attentive and polite while not being too overbearing. All in all it was a great meal, and I can't wait to go back to this place. 4.5/5.

Being the pizza connoisseurs that we are, we decided to try Cibo a few weeks ago after reading some pretty stellar reviews on Yelp. As you can tell by now from the sheer amount of 4 and 5 star reviews, this place has got it going on like Donkey Kong (sorry).   In no particular order, here are some of my favorite things about Cibo:   1. It's right next door to Tammie Coe! We love us some red velvet cupcakes that Ms. Coe bakes up, so it's almost a little too perfect that two of our most favorite things in Phoenix are right across the street from each other!!   2. The pizza of course silly! Last time we tried three of their pizza's and they were all phenomenal. You could order cow dung and bird feathers on pizza and they would make it taste moist and delicious, that's how good they are! This pizza reminds me a lot of the pizza they serve at the almighty Pizzeria Bianco....and that's saying something.   3. Simon Crown! Who is Simon Crown you ask? Why, he's only the greatest keyboard player west of the Mississippi! Well, that might be a slight stretch, but he is a really cool black dude who plays catchy and happy melodies on weekends while you eat in the outdoor patio and wait to be seated. He even sells his CD there for $15, but he only accepts cash so make sure to bring some extra spending money next time you go to Cibo so you can support a unique local artist!    4. Great for people watching. Cibo was voted one of the best places to go on a first date in Phoenix, so you'll be sure to see lot's of awkwardness between couples of all ages. It could even turn into a fun game while you wait to be seated....like, who can be the first person to spot the couple on their first date?   Well, even if none of the aforementioned reasons for visiting Cibo strikes your fancy, you've just got to bite the bullet and try this place already! I promise you won't go home disappointed (unless you're a real jerk).

I feel like such a noob. We consider ourselves foodies to a certain degree, but before joining Yelp we had never heard of this magical mysterious place called Fez. So after seeing the sheer volume of good reviews on the place, it was pretty much destiny that a trip to Fez was in order.   Upon first arriving there the first thing that'll catch your eye is how trendy it is. The place is drenched with a hipster vibe that's hard to shake. You'll also quickly notice a very skewed gay:straight ratio. I would usually never bring this up, but it was quite obvious the night we went that we were possibly one of the only straight couples there. This extends to the waiters too... don't get me wrong, I have no problem with it... in fact it made for a more fun and interesting dining experience; just be forewarned if you aren't comfortable with things like being offered a drink called "The G-Spot" by a feminine male waiter, this may not be the type of place for you.   So now... onto the food. The food was superb... starting off with those heavenly Cinnamon-dusted Sweet Potato Fries. Damn they're good... basically they're some of the best fries I've ever had, period. I bow down the God of Cinnamon and Sweet Potatoes... because the combination is heavenly. For our main dish we got a Fez Kisra followed by the Apricot glazed Salmon. Both were quite yummy. The Kisra is basically a healthier version of a pizza with some more adventurous types of toppings... the one we got had pears on it. It was good, but would be hard to eat one alone because the flavor is quite distinct and a little rich... so it's perfect to split. The salmon was well cooked and flavorful, no complaints there.   Overall we had a great meal at Fez, we'll more than likely be back... if anything to try 'Fez Foodies' which we've heard so much about. What a cool place!

You gotta love Matts Big Breakfast...a simple menu with the freshest ingredients, good service, and a cozy down home setting that makes you feel like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen. We got lucky on our last visit b/c it was later in the day and drizzling outside, so there was no wait at all and we got right in. I don't think I would try to go here during peak hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning, unless you like waiting a while to get seated.   We ordered the Salami Scramble (good) and the Waffle (great), along with a side of bacon. Their bacon is definitely one of the best in all of Phoenix, that's for sure. It's flavorful and juicy and crisp all at the same time.   I don't think I would change a thing about this place, except for the sketchy location that it is in. It's kind of artsy fartsy and trendy on the one hand, but then on the other hand there are about 5 crack dens surrounding it. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be there alone at night.....hence why it is a breakfast place I guess. We actually experienced some of the shadiness first hand when we went to the hotel next door to go pee after our meal (no bathroom in the place). There was a torn up hooker in her 50's arguing with the lady at the check in desk about money with some guy who was missing all of his front teeth. There was obviously something illegal about to do down in one of the rooms, so we peed as quickly and quietly as we could and left the scene before we could get shot. Even so, getting shot is definitely worth the risk for some of their delicious food!

I usually hate cupcakes, cake, and any other sugary-sweet pastries you can think of. I get 'sweeted out' way too quick, so I tend to stay away from anything that looks like it might have too much sugary goodness in it. I'm the person you'll see at the birthday party scraping the frosting off the cake...then still only eating a couple bites.   Tammy Coe's Red Velvet Cupcakes changed all of that.  The creamy yet not overly sweet frosting is what I think does it. The moist red spongy cake covered in this heavenly concoction creates a blast of flavor that is so good it causes temporary lapse of brain function.   ...I've yet to try anything else she makes because the red velvet cupcakes are so good, but I'm saving the possible fifth star for when I do. Eventually I'm hoping I'll venture out and try some of her other creations but for now, if you ever see two people wandering the alleys of central phoenix with red dust around their mouths, don't worry it's just my girl and I on a red velvet hangover.   4/5.

Being big fans of Japanese culture, the lovely lady and I were quite excited to discover there is an annual 'Festival of Japan' in downtown Phoenix. The Japanese are cool people... let's get this straight... whenever you come across something in life that is awesome; nine times out of ten you'll find yourself saying "Hey... I think that started in Japan". (My blatant love of everything Japan is probably coming through quite loud and clear here...)  Even though it was quite rainy the weekend of the festival, we decided it was still worth it to brave the harsh weather (harsh weather = it was sprinkling, and there were a few small puddles to hop over... hey it's Arizona!). We went on Sunday and despite being a little worried that they'd be wrapping everything up... the festival was pretty much in full swing. There were probably about 50-60 vendors sprinkled around and in Heritage Square (In case you didn't know, as a point of reference Heritage Square is where Pizzeria Bianco is). On top of the vendors there were probably 8-10 different food places, some offering extensive menus and others offering more specific things.   The high point of the vendors for us was the bonsai trees... which were so damn cool... we've known about bonsai trees for a long time but somehow seeing these ones in person made us leave with a "must get a bonsai tree" mindset. The food was pretty tasty... we indulged in quite a few random things like mochi, spicy noodles, a chicken skewer, and some shaved ice. The food wasn't jaw droppingly good, but it did the trick and was pretty good for what it was. The main reason you should go to this though isn't the food or the vendors... it's for the dyn-o-mite people watching! The cosplayers were out in full effect for this and there were all sorts of weird, wacky, and flat out interesting outfits. If seeing overweight middle aged men dressed in odd ninja outfits and young women randomly sporting furry tails sounds interesting to you... then you'll probably have as much fun as we did.   I sure hope this festival continues, Phoenix really needs more local flavor like this throughout the year to keep things interesting... we'll definitely be back next year!

Pita Jungle is always consistently good. We have been there quite a few times now, and every time we leave with our bellies full and satisfied. We are big fans of the pita crisp and the quesadilla. The service is usually fast and efficient, and the wait staff is young and funky, which gives the place a hip, local vibe. I would recommend this place most for lunch or a quick dinner on a weeknight, when you want something healthier than the usual fast food type places, but you don't want to go to a 'sit-down' type of place either, (even though pita jungle is sit downish too). Well, hopefully that made sense, but all in all a great place to grub on some good food!

What would all of us indy loving movie fans do without Camelview!!?   For any of the uninitiated out there, Camelview is basically the one main place in the Phoenix metropolitan area that plays all of the limited release and lesser known movies out there. They play the movies that the main theaters SHOULD be playing. The theater itself is nothing special.. it's old and no frills; but in my eyes the only thing that really counts here is what's on the screen! Here is a quick run-down of some of the movies I've seen at Camelview that weren't playing anywhere else when they were first released in Arizona:  No Country for Old Men There Will be Blood The Wrestler Napoleon Dynamite Grizzly Man A Serious Man Crazy Heart  That's just to name a few... basically a large portion of the critical hits that probably aren't going to make oodles of money will find an audience here; and thank God they do... if Camelview were to go away we'd left with the usual globbidy gloop of poopy that plays at all the main theaters (The weekly rut of romantic comedies and cliche action movies... no thanks!).   The other thing worth mentioning real quick is the type of people that go here. Generally I'd say a good 99% of people that go here are adults... you're not going to get crying kids or trouble making teenagers here. I've never had an issue with talking or texting during a movie and I think it's because most people that come here are 'movie people' and are genuinely interested in watching what's on the screen in a respectable fashion. God Bless Camelview!

What the hell happened to this place?  I used to love Chino Bandido... their wacky Mexican/Asian combos seemed to give me consistent mouth-gasms every time I'd go there. Within the past year or so however something changed, the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be.   Just to illustrate this point, I decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in (the place was empty by the way) I was greeted with a "wassup' by the main kid at the register... nothing more than that... just "wassup" with a look on his face like I was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory... not very welcoming to say the least.   After ordering my combo dish 'to go'... I was treated to about a 15 minute wait, and while I was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other. Some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review. It was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking. It was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long, staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves... I almost walked out without my food even though I had already paid; because let's be honest... the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind.   After my long wait, and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquent-looking employees (who by the way didn't mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when I left)... I went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container. Let me just tell you my friends, it was not pretty. It looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice... then put in on the floor and stepped on it. It was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness... no substance, just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement.  By no means should you go here, unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff... so this is your warning; avoid the Chandler location like the plague!

I came across this place not too long ago while suffering through a savage craving for anything Mexican (this happens a lot to me). I was driving around in circles looking for a little dive that might have some authentic and spicy tacos. I just so happened to see a cheap little sign pointing towards this place, and figured what the hell.   First things first... upon walking into this place I noticed it was a little rank; it didn't smell very good, and it was pretty muggy inside. There were two Hispanic gentlemen behind the counter who immediately welcomed me as I quickly studied the menu on the wall. What I first noticed about the menu is that it was all very authentic... very much like if the building was picked up and moved over to Chandler from some small Mexican town. As I was looking, I also noticed some sort of weird mound of meat on a giant metal stick; it was clearly visible in the back room which I'll admit scared me a little bit. I think I may have seen something similar on "Bizarre Foods" once... but I have no idea what the hell it actually was.   Given such a wide array of different choices from the menu, I was immediately puzzled about what I would actually order. This is when one of the guys behind the counter tried to give me some help... he started asking/telling me things in very broken English... like "You like Spicy?" and "Good Pollo!". While he was telling me these things, I got the sense something fishy was going on; because as he was talking to me he was also intermittently laughing hysterically and speaking Spanish with his work buddy. Kind of seemed like one of those "look at this stupid gringo" moments. I was pretty out of my element. To make a long story short... I went with the chicken tacos (except they were called something else, which I didn't understand) and an order of chips with salsa. I took home my steaming back of goodness to pig out... and OH NO... they couldn't have... the horror:   Dark meat chicken... Arrrrrrrrrgghhhhhhhhh!   I take for granted that there are still places that serve dark meat chicken without thinking twice about it or warning you... I also take for granted that there are people out there that actually like dark meat chicken. I can't stand it... to me dark meat chicken tastes like white meat chicken which has gone rotten. I have an immediate gut reaction to it, so needless to say I took one bite of my taco and threw the rest away. I did however eat my chips and salsa like a madman, and they were pretty tasty... so I can't fault them for that.   So this may be a tad unfair... but I feel like a lack of white meat chicken shows that a restaurant is cutting corners and using sub-par ingredients. It'd be like if Jamba Juice used Kool-Aid or Tang to make their smoothies... not cool! If I return I'll try something else non-feathered and I'll leave room for the possibility of an upgraded review... but for now I'm going to brand Taqueria Mi Casita with a shameful 2/5 stars.

We got out of bed bright and early to go try this place today (bright and early = 12 o'clock...yeah, we're lazy assholes). Driving down University it'd be easy to mistake this place for just another bland eatery; let's be honest... Tempe has got plenty of 'em. The second I sat down and tried a bite of one of their Macaroons I knew this place was the real deal.   We met my brother and his girlfriend, so the good thing is that between the four of us, we were able to try quite a bit of different menu items. Our favorite was probably their Croque Madame...excellent bread, fresh cheese, local vegetables, and a nicely cooked egg on top; it has some sort of sauce in it too; although I'm not sure exactly what...but it was melt in your mouth juicy. Also the breakfast quesadilla was superb as was the side of peppered bacon.   We also got a couple of lunch items, the steak sandwich and the burger...yikes; tasty, tasty, tasty. It was all very fresh tasting, and knowing that everything is locally grown added a nice touch. Oh yeah...MACAROONS...pretty flippin tasty. We tried the caramel, vanilla, then chocolate mint one...they were all unique and worth trying.   We loved this place...our fingers are officially crossed that they open one up a little closer by in the northern Scottsdale area...good shit! 4.25/5.

Bing-effing-Soo. My new favorite thing in life. If you're like me, you've probably never heard of "Bingsoo" before. It's one of those things that makes me feel like I'm not as culturally aware as I think I am. Bingsoo is a Korean dessert which works like this:   -You take a bowl and fill the bottom portion with shaved ice.  -You take some frozen yogurt and plop it on top of the shaved ice.  -Sprinkle in a healthy serving of fresh fruit into the mix. (your choice of what)  -Finally add a fruit puree to top it off.   ...now if you're a finicky eater like me, then your first instinct might be to try and eat the Bingsoo as it is served in different layers...don't do it...this is one instance where you wanna bring back your inner first grader, and just mix it all up into a mush. Trust me...it's absolutely delicious that way. If you're a bit crazy...add some boba balls into the mix, to top it all off...why not. If you mix it all up, you'll be left with a blissful bowl of icy/fruity goodness. I can't believe it took me 27 years of walking this earth to discover that shaved ice mixed with yogurt and fruit could be such a heavenly (and healthy) treat.   They also serve boba tea and all sorts of other random smoothies, drinks and desserts...but you come here for the Bingsoo. I really hope Bingsoo catches on, because if the mainstream public could taste this stuff they'd be hooked...most people in America just haven't heard of it I'm assuming, so they don't know what they're missing. I'm not aware of any other place in the valley that serves this up besides Fresco...I could be wrong though.   You heard it here...   Add Bingsoo to your 'toodoo' list.   4/5

Over the course a few trips, Yasu has quickly become my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix. The fish is always very fresh and the grilled/cooked options are out of this world. It can be just a smidge pricier than some other sushi places, but you are paying for quality and you get it. They do have happy hour during the week which goes through 6pm and gives you a nice selection of tapas and sushi for $5 a pop.  The atmosphere feels very authentic. Yasu is front and center of the very small dining room...often he is conversing with guests and overall just looking like he's having a great time. It's part of the charm of eating here. He is also very passionate about his food and it shows. He will often make recommendations about what is fresh and different for the day. You feel like you are in good hands when you eat here, like someone has your back in the kitchen.   There is a huge selection, far too big to even discuss individual plates/sushi options. In fact, if I had one complaint it's that they have too many menus. For a first time diner it can be a little daunting to sort it all out. You've got the daily menu, the regular menu, the tapas menu, the sushi menu, and I think one other menu. Simplifying things, would be the only thing I would change at this otherwise heavenly spot.  I highly recommend this spot, it has spoiled me and become the measuring stick I compare other local sushi joints to.   4.75/5.

Decided to try this place the day before Valentines Day, which meant a little longer wait than usual since all the lovebirds were out and about.  Well, we finally got seated after about an hour wait and decided to try a four course selection that was about $30 bucks per person.  One of the courses was a salad, which neither of us are very big fans of at all.  We asked our waiter if we could substitute chips and salsa ($5 bucks value) for a salad that we wouldn't even eat ($10 buck value).  The waiter just shook his head and gave some lame excuse about the computer not being able to do a switch and that we would have to get a salad, even if we weren't going to eat it.  We were disappointed that they could not even compromise at all and told the waiter to not even bring out our salads since we weren't going to eat them.    Well, besides that small let down, the rest of the meal was very good. For our appetizer we got AZ egg rolls, which were really melt in your mouth good, served with some delicious dipping sauce.  For the main dish, we got the pork tenderloin and center cut steak with Parmesan cheese melted on top, which came with fries that were very tasty.  Our dessert was a really rich white chocolate brownie served with ice cream and chocolate sauce and real flakes of white chocolate on top.  It was so rich that between the two of us, we probably had 5 bites.    So all in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to go on a Saturday night, the prices are reasonable, the service is good (even if they aren't as flexible as they should be at times with the menu), and the food is very tasty. 3.75/5.

Pet Peeve #1 - When Yelper's give an establishment a bad review based solely on service issues alone without staying to eat. If you didn't even eat the food then are you really entitled to write a scathing review?   ...knowing this...I'm about to piss myself off and break my own rule...because I'm going to do the exact thing I hate; as described above. Damn me.   My brother and I went out on a week night a while ago for some reverse happy hour grub, and just so happened to cruise by this place. Upon seeing the uber-cool iguana wearing sunglasses on the sign which instantly reminded me of those cool 80's IZOD shirts, we knew we had to stop. Sadly, upon entering the place just had this grimy look and feel to it, the kind of feel you get when you stop at a Dairy Queen in some one horse town on the way to Vegas. The experience that followed is summarized below:   -We park and enter the front door.  -There is no hostess or visible employee anywhere.  -We wait for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do.  -Still no employees around...we wander the whole place...and to our shock do not find a single waiter/waitress/hostess/bartender/cook anywhere.  -We go back to the front room, standing there confused about what we should do.  -Wait five minutes.  -Walk around again...still not a single employee of Iguana Macks to be found anywhere.  -Leave to find a better establishment...in this case...Applebees. (Which is saying a lot because I hate Applebees.)   ...can someone explain how a restaurant/bar like this can be devoid of any/all employees around 10 o'clock? I was tempted to go and ask one of the inebriated bar patrons, but it just didn't seem worth the hassle. I would have liked to try Iguana Macks; but sadly wasn't given the chance. It shouldn't be a challenge to eat somewhere...an establishment should be courting you for your business, and this was the complete opposite.   Now the bigger question is this...where were the employees? Some of my theories:   -An all at once employee weed smoking break  -They were transported to an alternate timeline and are now living in a parallel universe where they work for a classier restaurant. Kind of like 'Lost' for wait staff.  -Employee Orgy   ...eh, who knows...but I'm just not too jazzed about going back to try this place. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even have any of the food; that's saying something.

Although a generic stucco building from the outside, Butterfields is anything but your typical drab breakfast/lunch eatery.  Clean and contemporary, this restaurant abounds with subtle touches throughout that make it stand out among the hordes of restaurants in Scottsdale.  From ceiling lights made to look like waffles, and a fresh juice squeezer along the back wall surrounded by boxes of ripe oranges, this place has the magical "it" factor.    The staff are all fast and efficient, and more importantly they are all genuinely friendly and just as excited about the menu as a first time guest would be.  Speaking of menu, the breakfast food at Butterfields is in a class by itself.  Some of the highlights include the Apple Cinnamon French Toast, Toasted Pecan Waffle, Egg and Cheese Quesadillas and their original skillets are perfectly delicious.  And for not much more than you would pay at a chain restaurant, you can have a one of a kind breakfast that will leave you wanting more and already planning your next trip back before you even leave the building.  This is definitely the ultimate breakfast eatery in Scottsdale!

More than a dozen trips later... and Butterfields continues to be consitently excellent. We go here almost every single weekend for breakfast, and not once have we had a less than stellar meal; and we've tried just about every damn thing on the menu.  If you go here... ASK FOR WILLIE!!!!! Willie is probably the best breakfast waiter we've ever had... he's always on top of everything, but best of all he's got a contagious happy attitude. If you go there and have him as waiter, It's nearly impossible to leave without a smile on your face. After having him only a couple times, he had already memorized what we order. Now we specifically ask for his section, because I think as diners it's our responsibility to reward good wait staff... it can make all the difference in the world when it comes to your dining experience.   That is all...

This is the first place that I'm going to review badly despite their amazing food. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to customer service with wait staff and restaurant employees... but this place is bad enough to make me a not-so-nice guy.   We've been here quite a few times and never once were treated satisfactory by the lackluster staff. Despite their tacos being some of the best amongst these Chipotle-like Mexican places... the service is horrible enough to make me not care.   Let me explain here...   First off, there isn't a single associate here that seems genuinely happy about being there. Some of them are yelling and singing stuff back and forth during busy times, but it seems like more of a gimmick than anything. On several occasions I've been met with snooty responses to simple questions... like this:  Me: "Can I get salsa in my taco's please?" Them: "Uh, you want enchilada sauce in your tacos" Me: "No, I want salsa in my taco's." Them: "You want Pico De Gallo in your taco's?" Me: "No, I want salsa in my taco's"              *Points to Salsa container* Them: "Uh" *Blank look on face* Me: "Ummmmmmm" *Doesn't know what else to say* Them: "So you want salsa in your taco's" Me: "Yeahhhhhhh" Them: "Ok"            *Proceeds to scoop enchilada sauce into mini side cup and put on my tray.  Me: "Eh"             *Walks away without salsa, and gives up in shame*  ...this salsa misunderstanding is one of three times this has happened to me at Cafe Rio. I don't know how it's possible... but I think some of their staff don't know what salsa is. I feel like that should be a requirement for working at a Mexican restaurant, but apparently to the dunces behind the counter; all sauce which is red in color is the same thing.   On other occasions I've been given the wrong kind of meat, then all but yelled at when telling them it was wrong. They also gave my Mom shit once because she asked for corn taco's instead of flour. She has a food allergy and can't eat flour tortillas... but the guy behind the counter couldn't understand that and kept insisting that she should go with flour; while my poor Mom tried to defend and explain herself; I was there when it happened and it was f'ing weird.   All this, and to add to it their beloved 'Taco Tuesdays' here has become a sham. It started out being a dollar per taco which was a good deal, then they raised it to $1.50... which was questionable... they then raised it again to $2.00 per taco; which isn't even special. Six bucks for three tacos is pretty much regular price! I wonder if they just think people are stupid enough to go in and pay that without realizing the price isn't special at all. Additionally the regular prices are a bit higher than other similar options like Q'doba or Chipotle. It's also extra for some toppings which you can get for free at other places. I think they believe their food is good enough to excuse the higher prices and horrible service, but it most certainly isn't!   This place only gets two stars because their pork tacos are damn good, and their flour tortillas are pretty amazing. Other than the food though, this place fails on every level.

If you have ever had an insatiable craving for fry bread on a Sunday afternoon, you can certainly understand my frustration at not being able to find any decent (or not so decent) fry bread places open on the day of rest. After fervently searching Yelp and making about a dozen phone calls only to get a recorded message on the other end, I finally stumbled upon this place located in the 'Fantastic Swap Meet' building.  After a quick phone call to make sure they were open (until 5pm that day), we jumped in the car and went completely out of our way to satisfy our impromptu craving for some hot, cheesy, beany fry bread.  We pulled up to the swap meet parking lot about twenty minutes later, and looked at each other and wondered out loud if we should even get out of the car.  It was a little rough to say the least, but at this point our craving was such that we would have gladly ventured into a crack den to score some doughy goodness if we had to.    Angelina's is a no frills type of place with a few chairs and tables outside of the pick up window.  They do have Mexican food available, but I was so focused on the pictures of the fry bread, I really didn't notice much of anything else.  We got our standard bean and cheese; one fry bread would have been enough to feed about four people.  It was everything we had hoped it would be.

This is an odd and confounding review to write. This place has got solid five star reviews, so it looks like I'm going to be the odd man out here in the experience I had when I visited.  My girl and I are getting married soon, so the other day we decided to start yelping places to look for a suit. We found Men's Apparel Club shining like a beacon amongst the mostly scathing Men's Wearhouse reviews. It was a no brainer...an affordable and well reviewed local business...I had my mind made up and my credit card in the holster ready to buy if I found something decent.  Upon walking in, we were promptly greeted by Barry and had a quick discussion regarding the style I was looking for. He quickly found a suit that was right down my alley and that I could easily see myself getting into. This is maybe where we got off on the wrong foot. As Barry was talking about the suit, my fiance got out her phone to show him a picture of her dress, just to get his opinion on if they would match or not. She was quickly given a 'sweetie...no pictures' warning, as Barry thought she was getting her phone out to take pictures. This is fine, I understand his reasoning behind this, but the experience went downhill at this point.   What happened from here...I'm still confused about. I began to ask questions about the suit, as he allowed me to try the coat portion on and educated us on the ins and outs of buying a suit for a good ten minutes or so. I liked how the coat fit, and was definitely thinking I needed to try on the whole get up. That's when he hit us with this...I quote:  "I know I'm wasting my time with people like you. You're not gonna buy here, and I know that. You're gonna shop around and do what you do. That's okay. I don't mind helping you out. I really don't. You know why? You're young and you don't know any better. You gotta learn this stuff some way. I feel like it's my duty".   This statement didn't sit well with me right off the bat. There's nothing worse than being told what sort of person you are. Stereotyping/assuming to this level is something I've rarely experienced in a retail situation. I don't tolerate it in my personal life, and absolutely won't stand for it when I'm voluntarily looking to give someone my business. I let it slide and moved on.  We both at this point made a concerted effort to let him know that we were in fact very much considering buying a suit at his establishment. I even at one point said "I haven't heard the best things about Men's Wearhouse and other similar places, so I'm absolutely interested in making the purchase here if we can find something". I tried to make several not so subtle hints, that I was in fact very much wanting and willing to make a purchase with him, but he wasn't hearing it for some reason or another.   He continued to almost 'anti-sell' us from this point out. It was extremely odd. It was like the opposite of being at a car dealership. We felt as if we couldn't try on suits or buy anything there even if we wanted to. He made multiple comments regarding shopping around at other places and continued to minimize our intention to buy. The odd thing was...he gave us all sorts of good advice regarding the ins and outs of buying a suit. However, at the same time he seemed unwilling and uninterested in selling us one personally!   After about 25 minutes we finally decided it was time to go, as we really didn't feel very welcome. On the way out of the door I tried one more last ditch effort to let him know I was interested, it went like this:  "So, if I end up deciding on this suit would I be able to come back in early October to get everything going?"  Barry - "October...I may not be around. You'll probably have to go elsewhere".   This was the story of our trip to Men's Apparel Club...the underlying feeling that our business wasn't wanted. I'm really not sure why or how this happened, some possibilities come to mind:  -Communication style differences causing some sort of misunderstanding. -The phone issue getting the idea in his head that we had no intention of buying. -Us being young and Barry not taking us seriously. -Barry possibly having previous bad experiences with shoppers like us, leading to an unfair stereotype. -Some other issue I haven't thought of or didn't realize.  It's too bad we had this experience, because the truth is. This place has the best prices in town by far.  My suit at Men's Apparel Club - less than $250 My suit at Men's Wearhouse - $600  So in the end, I don't doubt that this is a great place to buy a suit for some people...it just wasn't for us based on our experience. Maybe I caught Barry on an off day, I'm not sure. Maybe Barry doesn't even realize the bad taste we left with. I'm now left in the odd position to thank Barry for all the great advice he gave me on buying a suit, then scratch my head and ask him why he didn't seem to want to sell me one.

If they just had more locations I envision this place being the ultimate 'Chipotle-Killer'. I know it's a bit taboo to love chain restaurants here on Yelp... but I can't help it, Costa Vida has got the goods.   It's all about their sweet pork... whether in a taco or burrito the stuff is made of WIN. They cook all of their tortillas fresh as you order, so when you walk into the place your nose is hit with the delightful aroma of freshly cooked flour tortillas. The concept should be familiar... walk through the line and build your meal as they cook it; just like Chipotle/Q'Doba/Cafe Rio. What sets Costa Vida apart for me is the freshness... I enjoy Chipotle on occasion but it seems like much more of a manufactured product, as to where Costa Vida looks and taste much more home-made.   This is the type of place you can go to hungry and leave full, the food isn't greasy so it's filling in a good way. Easily recommendible! 4/5.   P.S. Can someone explain to me why there are so many Mormon owned Mexican restaurants in the East Valley? It's always perplexed me. (I.E. Bajio, Cafe Rio, and this place just to name a few).

We've been to First Watch several times now for breakfast and each time go we always feel satisfied when we leave. The food is on the healthier side, and the portions are more in line with what a "normal" serving size should be, unlike some places that pile on the food until their patrons are unbuckling their belts and practically throwing up when they walk out the door.   They even find a way to make the potatoes crispy and light instead of weighed down in grease and oil. The food is good, and everything we've tried we have really enjoyed, but if you're looking for a breakfast place that will knock your socks off, you won't find that here. And that's perfectly fine. This place doesn't pretend to be the next best thing since....well I don't know what.... and it doesn't need to because plenty of people like this place for exactly what it is: A healthy, reliable and affordable breakfast eatery that always delivers fresh tasty food with great service. For what it lacks in an adventurous and exciting menu, it makes up for with the quality and consistency of the food that does come out of the kitchen, and that's what keeps people coming back for more.   3.75/5

Agua Frescas...the term always eluded me. I knew it was some sort of Mexican drink, but I never really took the time to give it a shot, I guess my disdain for Horchata scared me off from other ethnic drinks, well...Los Reyes de la Torta made me regret my shortsightedness. After trying the Agua Frescas here, I went home and all but prayed for forgiveness from the Agua Fresca God for doubting him...this is one seriously good drink...at least at Los Reyes de la Torta it is.   This place was our back up plan for dinner last Saturday...and quickly became our first choice because our other front runner (Sonora Mesquite Grill) seemed to be inexplicably closed on Saturday evening. This ended up being a blessing though, because I can't imagine having a better Mexican meal than we did at Los Reyes de la Torta.   Right when you walk in, you know this place means business. Open kitchen, great smelling food being cooked up, 'best of' signs posted everywhere, and a packed house with people smiling and enjoying themselves wherever you look.   Upon first opening the menu, we noticed the prices...dirt cheap. Because of this we decided to get three menu items to try, along with a couple of agua frescas. Here's a breakdown of what we tried:   -Pineapple Agua Fresca - Delicious...frothy and natural tasting with each sip filled with a mouth full of mini pineapple bits.   -Lime Agua Fresca - Like a fresh squeezed lime...unbelievable refreshing.   -Asada Quesadilla - We both liked this the most out of anything we got. Fresh and tasty cheese, awesome tortilla, great tasting carne asada, and a mixture tomatoes/beans/cilantro/avacodo...melt in your mouth good.   -Cubana Torta - We are big torta fans, but had to try one here. It was good, but we weren't blown away...again, we aren't big torta fans...so take this with a grain of salt.   -Carne Asada Tacos - Okay, I know we already got a carne asada quesadilla...but we really like carne asada...so we just had to do it. The tacos were pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were spectacular. Everything in the taco tasted great but the mini tortillas they use for the tacos wasn't quite as tasty as the flour tortilla they used for the quesadilla.   ...we left stuffed and satisfied with our meal. The only possible negative thing about this place is that they don't serve chips and salsa, which is a shame. The hot sauce they bring out to your table to go with your meal would go great with some warm crunchy chips.   All in all...this place is excellent. Authentic quality Mexican food for dirt cheap, anyone in the area should definitely check it out. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. This is a possible 5 star place, just need to go a few more times before it gets 'bumped up'.   4.25/5.

During a recent trip to Vegas, we had a few places in mind that we just had to try; Payard was one of those places. It's located somewhere in the maze of a hotel that is Caesar's Palace... both times we ate there we nearly got lost, but alas we were able to find it and indulge in some of the yummiest breakfast/lunch food in Vegas.   Payard is made up of two parts; there is a breakfast/lunch sit down restaurant and an attached walk-up pastry/chocolate counter. We tried both parts during our vacation. First was the actual restaurant... we slept in a little too long for breakfast, but we ate lunch and were able to get a couple of lunch items that were very 'breakfast-y' anyway. First thing we noticed was the decor... the set up of this place is awesome; the colors and overall style of the place is just very vibrant. Additionally the kitchen is a circular area in the middle of the restaurant... so nothing is hidden; I love that!   We ordered the french toast which came in a bed of fresh fruit and some kind of fruit flavored sauce. The flavor was amazing, not too heavy but very rich and flavorful. Next we ordered eggs florentine which was served on a crispy crescent roll... and we also got a side of bacon. All in all each part of the meal was near perfect... taste was outstanding and everything just seemed very fresh. A couple days later we also tried the pastry counter, and ordered a ham/cheese sandwich type thing (don't remember the actual name they called it) along with an apple crepe. Just like the restaurant itself, it didn't disappoint. Heavy on flavor, not too greasy, and oh so rich... it hit the spot perfectly.   Payard is the type of place I love... solid food and a classy atmosphere, while not being ridiculously priced. It's earned a spot for us as a 'go-to' Vegas breakfast/lunch spot from now on. Can't wait to go back and try their full breakfast menu. This place gets my stamp of approval, next time you're in Vegas if you can find this place... give it a shot!

Technically speaking, this restaurant has everything a good restaurant in North Scottsdale should have: nice decor and ambiance, intriguing menu with lots to try, live music, and a good location.  After reading some stellar four and five star reviews on Yelp, we were pretty excited to try it out for dinner, however we found ourselves leaving sorely disappointed with both the food and the service.    Mistake #1:  Not a big crowd on a Friday night. Granted we did arrive a little later than the normal dinner crowd (8ish), but there were very few people eating here which was a little disconcerting.  Mistake #2:  Had to wait over half an hour just to order, even though the place was empty.  Our waiter apparently decided to go on a smoke break (and we're not talking cigarettes here people) right when we sat down.  This left me no option but to go to the front and ask the girls why we weren't being served.  They apologized profusely and got our waiter out to our table in a few minutes.   Mistake #3:  The food was not that great.  We ordered two small pizzas, two appetizers (baby back ribs and stuffed bell pepper) and pork tenderloin cooked to medium.  The pizza's both were cold and tasted like cardboard and the pork tenderloin was a little on the tough side, definitely not cooked medium.  The appetizers were okay, but for all the food that we got, we both left ready to snack when we got home since we didn't finish our less than spectacular meal.  I will say that the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was pleasant, but those are about the only redeeming qualities I can find in this restaurant.  We will surely not go back to Javino's for the simple fact that there are an abundance of restaurants in Scottsdale alone that offer the whole package in the dining experience without compromising the service or the quality of food.  Nice try though....   2.5/5.

Humble Pie gets no respect.  There are quite a few 'marquee' pizza places in the valley...some that come to mind would be Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, The Parlor, Pomo, and Patsy Grimaldis. Ask a random person on Yelp what their favorite pizza place is, and chances are you're gonna hear one of those names mentioned. (This includes us by the way).   I've never heard anyone say that Humble Pie is their favorite or even in their top three. I wonder why? I could be crazy...but if I was to take a Humble Pie pizza and put it in a taste test with the aforementioned places...I don't think the majority of people would notice a big difference in the level of 'goodness'. Each place has unique flavors, but they're all really damn tasty. Unless you're familiar which how each pie tastes from experience, I think you'd be stumped to identify which came from where. What I'm trying to say is Humble Pie can hang with the big boys.   So...I'm sitting here wondering now...why don't more people rave about this place...why don't I myself rave about this place?! Could it be something so simple as atmosphere? Humble Pie's interior is very...should I say...humble. There's nothing snazzy or memorable about this place, other than the actual food which is quite good. Cibo is in a quaint old house, Pizzeria Bianco is overflowing with prestige and this aura of greatness from all the national attention...Humble Pie is basically just a storefront with an interior that could have very well been put together by someone who just read 'Interior Design for Dummies'...it doesn't take much chances, and it shows.   So...what does that leave us with here?   A pizza place with awesome food, but not much else. I definitely recommend it, but I expect it to continue to hover right below the other more well known places for the foreseeable future.   3.5/5  (Rounded up to 4 since we ate here on one of our first date nights, and I have fond memories of it.)

And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating.   Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease.   Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger.   The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.  P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger.   DO NOT GO HERE.

Had a hunger itch we needed to scratch, so we ventured here on a late Sunday morning and let me tell you my friends...the itch was scratched...it was scratched feverishly well. Ok, enough metaphorical jib jab...I'll get to the point here...Scratch was wonderful.  We went there on a blazing hot Sunday afternoon, looking for a little refuge from the heat...and of course a satisfying late breakfast. It was a little hard to locate at first...there's a lot of construction in the area, so if you aren't paying attention you'll miss it. It's in a really unassuming strip mall-ish location...the strip mall itself is surrounded by all sorts of retirement homes and centers, if you go into the Fry's next door I can almost guarantee that if you're under the age of 50, you'll be one of the youngest people there...so it's a bit odd that this trendy hip bakery/bistro is located here...I certainly can't imagine any retirees feeling too comfortable eating at a place like this (or maybe I just haven't met enough 'hip' older people).   We ended up trying a breakfast sandwich (served up on a yummy croissant roll), eggs florentine, a crepe (with sugar and French butter), and a red velvet cupcake to top it all off. Everything was very fresh and had a crisp taste...both the breakfast sandwich and the eggs florentine seemed to focus much more on quality than quantity, which I always appreciate since I don't like huge portions, but would much rather savor a smaller meal...but this being said; be forewarned if you are into big portions, a single menu item here may not fill you up. The crepes were probably my favorite thing we tried...cooked to perfection and filled with some sort of rock sugar which just complimented the crepe with butter really well...it's pretty much a dessert, but I can't help but recommend it as an addition to whatever else you may try here no matter what time of the day it is. Lastly, the red velvet cupcake was just sort of okay. We've yet to find somewhere who can make a cupcake as good as Tammie Coe...but that isn't Scratch's specialty, so I can't fault them too much for it.   Overall, Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you're getting (at least for the breakfast menu we had). This is yet another time when I wondered why anyone in their right mind would go to Denny's or Coco's when you can get fresher, healthier, and much much tastier food at a place like Scratch for about the same price. Makes me wanna go over to one of these chain breakfast places and bitch slap anyone who gives their hard earned money to an inferior product.   4/5.

OH MY GOD BECKY....Look at this store, it is so BIG! It looks like one of those health food stores.   I like Whole Foods and I can not lie  You other shoppers can't deny  When you walk on in with a little bitty cart  and a sample in your face  You get happy  Maybe even a little wacky  Cuz you notice that the store is packing  Cheese and meat, with a wine bar and deli  Ain't nothin' that this store is lackin'   Deep in the produce they're displaying  I'm hooked and I can't stop staring  Fresh fruit and veggies from floor to ceiling  Oh baby, I wanna put you in my basket  So excited and I just can't mask it   I wanna get you home and UH, cook you up UH UH I like em' real thick and juicy So find that thick cut bacon If you're lucky it won't be taken I'm acting like an animal Now here's my scandal  Hey shoppers (yeah), hey shoppers (yeah)  Do you wanna eat healthy and organic (hell yeah)  Then turn around, grab a cart  Even Wal Mart's gotta shout  Whole Foods got back!    Best grocery store in AZ by far!  You gotta check out the wine bar!

Z'Tejas is quickly becoming one of our top "go to" breakfast places in town. They've got reasonable prices, the service is always great, and the best part of all is that they've got an amazing brunch menu...and don't even get me started on the cornbread.  It really is like having an extra little meal on the side and it's some of the best cornbread I've ever had the pleasure of slathering butter on and shoving down the gullet. Oh...and did I mention it's free with every meal? Yeah...makes us wanna high five the waitress each time we go there.  A few of our favorite items on the brunch menu are the breakfast quesadilla, bananas foster french toast (very sweet), and eggs benedict.  We also make sure to get the chips and salsa trio with any meal here since their chips are always nice and fresh like they just came out of the oven (or wherever fresh chips come from).  There aren't a ton of items on the brunch menu, but it suffices and never leaves us dissapointed.   The combo of good food and good service here should be the gold standard for chain restaurants...Z'Tejas knows its shit...they have fresh/fun food, and they have wait staff that are personable and always seem enthusiastic about the menu...can't ask for more than that. The only reason Z'Tejas isn't 5 stars is because is doesn't have that jaw dropping 'wow' factor with any of the dishes we've tried yet...it does have the "mmm...that's realllly good" factor going on...but not quite the "Arrrrgggh, I'm gonna have a seizure from overloading my taste buds with too much pleasure" factor. Still...a great place.   4/5.

I'll admit... the thought of going to a vegan restaurant was a little scary for me. I'm no vegetarian, and a meal without a little meat just doesn't seem like a full meal. In fact going into Fresh Mint, we even made provisions to do a post-meal In-n-Out burger trip just to get our meat fix in for the night. As it turns out, we didn't need to make our 'meat run'... this vegan food is rockin!   We got the kung pao soy chicken and a pad thai... both were very tasty. My soy chicken was so flavorful that if I wouldn't have known any better I'd have thought it was real chicken. The stand out here was the flavor... each dish seemed pretty perfectly seasoned; not too spicy but not too bland either. A lot of character and distinct tastes, which is always good.   Service was pretty good, but nothing amazing. One funny thing that happened, and I don't know if this is a nightly thing or not... but they gave us a stuffed animal when we paid (weird lookin' thing). The guy that gave it to us actually said 'Guys get the check, girls get a doll'. Odd.   Pretty solid place, although for the setting/decor it does seem a tad pricier than it should be. Give this place a shot!

My girl and I live right down the road from this place yet went quite a while without even knowing it was there... shame on us! I somehow stumbled upon Sweet Republic's Yelp page and was amazed at the abundance of 5 star reviews (almost every single one!)... and immediately planned to go check it out.   My expectations were pretty high, and luckily they were met and then some. The place has this very cool indy vibe to it... the decorations are very modern and the food/ice cream is all fresh and organic; a nice change of pace for an ice cream place. The flavors were quite varied from tried and true to bold and adventurous. We tried samples of two of their more adventerous offerings... first the bacon ice cream; then the basil-lime sorbet. Both sound just a tad revolting but were oddly enjoyable.   For our actual cups we got one double scoop of peanut butter and mint chocolate chip. Then for the second we got a mixture of desert honey and bananna berry. Each flavor was smooth and fresh... it just melted in my mouth. One thing I noticed is that it felt much lighter than your usual cup of ice cream. When I go to a place like Cold Stone Creamery I usually can only stomach a few bites of ice cream before I get 'sweetened out'. It's different here... maybe it's the fresh ingredients or something; but eating this ice cream just felt good!  Go check this place out... you'll never get ice cream at a boring old ice cream chain parlor again!

Here is the story of how we fell in love with a little Mexican restaurant called Habanero's:   Friday: Did a random yelp search for Mexican food in the Scottsdale area and stumbled upon some decent reviews for this place. Decided to try it out since it's not too far. After a slight detour we finally found a little unassuming store front in a generic looking shopping plaza with a red, white and green banner in front and knew that we must have finally found it. Ordered some flour tacos (fish, carne asada, shrimp, and carnitas) and a steak quesadilla along with a side of chips and salsa and our beloved Orange Bang drink that we were pleasantly surprised to find here. Within a few minutes of taking our first bites we turned to each other and proclaimed, "This shit is good!!" Fresh Mexican food that was reasonably priced and not overloaded with grease!! We were officially in lust.   Saturday: Couldn't stop thinking about how good Habanero's was from the night before and made plans to stop by for breakfast the next morning and try some of their breakfast burritos.   Sunday: Stopped by to grab a few breakfast burritos before our road tip to eat in the car. Bacon and steak burritos were delicious and not greasy at all, just like the rest of the menu. Egg, potatoes, meat and cheese in a fresh tortilla make these burritos worth coming back for again! And, breakfast served all day during the weekdays! Sweet!   Monday: Craving Habanero's again and we even made plans to stop by on our way back into town. Unfortunately for us, they closed early for the holiday, but we were more determined than ever to get our fix in the next day! Nothing could keep these star crossed lovers apart!   Tuesday: The craving was almost unbearable at this point. As soon as we got off of work we headed over to our new favorite place to pick up some tacos and another breakfast burrito. We were not disappointed, everything was just as amazing as the last few times we had visited. Habaneros can do no wrong!   So there you have it...if you're in the north Scottsdale area and craving some fresh authentic Mexican food that won't break the bank then head over to Habanero's and you'll be falling in love in no time at all!

Holy Shit. If 'the mission' of The Mission is to serve the best brunch in town...then...Mission easily accomplished. We went here for the weekend brunch the other day and our socks were completely knocked off by how amazing it was.   To start...it's just such a quaint and unique restaurant. The salt bricks...the old chandeliers...the antique furniture...it all makes you feel like you've stept into some fine dining establishment in a South American town.  Food was AMAZING. To start the chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa tasted almost like it had just been made minutes ago. We then ordered a Black Bean Arepa with fries and a Cinnamon Almond Waffle. The BBA was delectable...two freshly made thick corn tortillas with egg, cheese, black beans, and peppers...it really hit the spot. The fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato, and honestly are some of the best fries I've had in recent memory. Thin, crunchy and fresh tasting. The waffle was also sent from heaven...drizzled with candied almonds, cinnamon, cream, and topped with cinnamon ice cream. It was basically a wedding of breakfast and dessert in all the right ways. Top top it all off...this all came out to a mere 19 bucks. Unbelievable. Incredible value for your money when you're eating at a nice place like this. You could easily go spend the same amount of money at Denny's for God's sake.   It wasn't very busy when we were there and I'm not sure why. I'm guessing this place is more hoppin' around dinner time, and I can't wait to try their dinner menu. You've been warned though...you're missing out big time if you don't try brunch here. If they stop serving it due to a lack of demand, I might just explode like the dude at the end of Big Trouble in Little China.   GO HERE. 5/5.

Alas! A meal at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that made me say 'wow'. Despite being led astray by MapQuest and getting lost for about twenty minutes on our way there we eventually stopped at a gas station and asked for directions which led us to the promised land. It was a fun detour though, while asking for directions we got to witness a senile homeless man get into a heated argument with a gas pump; which is always a lot of fun.  First impressions are always a big thing, and Gallo Blanco made a pretty good one. Not knowing what type of place it was, we were quite surprised and excited when we turned the corner and saw a sheik and new age restaurant occupying the bottom floor of the Clarendon hotel. It looked swanky and fun... and honestly I was expecting something a little rougher around the edges; what a nice surprise.   Upon walking into the restaurant we were a little confused about where exactly the entrance was, so we found ourselves standing around looking like lost children... luckily one of the managers immediately noticed us and personally helped us out and sat us down pretty quickly... really nice guy. Right when we sat down, they instantly plopped a pretty heavenly looking basket of chips with a plate of three different salsas on our table, I pretty much instantly fell in love. The chips were fresh as can be; they looked and tasted like they had just been freshly made minutes ago, which I wouldn't be surprised if they were.   For our main course we got a little random smattering of stuff. Started out with the quesadilla then the roasted corn (it had some special name but I don't remember what it was) then for our main dish; three different types of tacos (beef, tuna, and pork) and huevos rancheros. Everything was amazing... just melt in your mouth good. The roasted corn which was rolled in some sort of cheese and hot sauce was just amazing; possibly the best roasted corn I've ever had. Even the dessert we ordered (banana crepes) was spectacular. Gourmet Mexican is not something I'm accustomed to... but that's the best way I can describe this place. The great thing about it, is that it's very reasonable... they sell many of the menu items a la carte; for example the quesadilla and most of our tacos were 2 bucks a piece... hell yeah! You get a lot of flavor and atmosphere for a really reasonable price, and I just can't justify giving this place anything less than 5 stars. Can't wait to go back!

Teavana o' Teavana... maker of heavenly teas The wonderful taste makes me weak in the knees  Oolong, Herbal, Green, Black or White Whatever the type, they are all a delight  ...seriously though, we love this place. We buy most of our Teavana online, but occasionally venture into the physical stores like this one. The loose leaf tea they sell here is absolutely amazing, it makes tea that is hard to compare to anything else I've ever tried. Some people who review Teavana seem to complain about price, but I call horseshit on that. It might be a little pricey compared to storebought tea; but you're paying for quality here people. We bought about $60 worth of various types of tea from their website and in total it should 250-300 cups of tea. If you figure that out, it works out to about 25 cents a cup... pretty damn reasonable if you look at it that way.   5/5.

The owner/chef of this place sold her soul to the devil...that's the only possible explanation I can logically think of to wrap my head around how Mexican food can be this good. So...why four stars you ask? Well...this is one of those cases where I have to consider consistency; and we've only been here once...so after a couple more visits, more than likely I'll be tacking on that coveted 5th star.   We checked this place out the other night and first thing I have to mention is that it was dead...the whole time we were there nobody else came in...which is scary; as others have mentioned, a place like this should be a mad house with the type of food they're serving up...God forbid someone from Cocoa's (which is next to it) actually grew some taste buds and walked over there for some real food.   Anyway, I'll get off my high horse...here is what we tried:  -Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.  -Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada I've ever had. Tender, flavorful, glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm.   -Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada taco's I pretty much didn't know what to say after biting into it, it left me speechless.  -Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner.   God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didn't get to try the guacamole, but Katrina thought it was great. Overall, we were just very impressed with this place and can't wait to go back. The owner even came over and talked to us for a bit about how the food is made fresh daily, and she seemed very proud of the way she cooks, it was inspiring...and it helps that she was super friendly and personable. I really really hope this place succeeds like it deserves to.   4.5/5.

I think we might have been a couple of jerks the day we wrote our first Yogurtland review. There's no doubt that there is big time market saturation with yogurt places in AZ, however we still need to give credit where credit is due. Since we first dissed Yogurtland (and all other yogurt places) a few months ago, we have been back there pretty much every other weekend or so, proving that not only are we jerks, but we are also hypocrites. To redeem ourselves, we're going to bump up Yogurtland from an okay three star rating, to a more appropriate rating of four stars.   The flavors are always tasty (good old tart is our personal favorite) with new variations every few weeks, the price is right (coming in at 30 cents per ounce) and the service is always good. This location always seems to be packed with yogurt lovers of all shapes and sizes, but the line moves quickly and it's fun to eavesdrop on peoples wacky conversations while you wait. It's so ironic that this place attracts yuppy Scottsdaliens, yet is so cheap...kind of messes with your head when you get the bill and it's something like $2.56. It's so ironic that some of the people getting Yogurt here probably just came from Barney's across the street...so yeah...what a dichotomy.   ...long story short...this place currently is winning the Arizona yogurt wars in our humble opinion. It just never gets old bathing in the superficiality of young Scottsdale hipsters while eating some tart yogurt...it's becoming a favorite past time of ours!

Modern Burger is weird. It's attached to an expensive steakhouse located in a ritzy mall, yet it's seems like it's trying to emulate an in-n-out burger type of experience albiet with slightly higher prices.   It's basically a little window you order from, and outside the order window is a couple of hightop counters with benches. It's set up perfectly for eating while people-watching...which let's be honest, is the best thing about going to Scottsdale Fashion Square.   It takes a few minutes on average, and you're presented with a couple of sliders. They aren't very big, but unless you've got a raging appetite, they should do the trick...especially if you get an order of fries with them. Each time we've went, the burgers have been cooked to perfection...they're really juicy and flavorful. Nothing fancy...just a straight up burger with all the regular toppings that'll melt in your mouth. There's something to be said about a nicely cooked burger. When you use fresh meat and cook it right...you don't need to get fancy and have exotic toppings. There's just something about these burgers that melts in your mouth...whatever it is...it's got me craving them every couple months if we happen to be at the mall.   I wouldn't go out of my way to get one of these burgers, but if you're already at the mall, you're not gonna do any better than Modern Burger for a nice little Mall lunch. It easily beats out all the other Mall food offerings. Worth a try. 3.75/5.

Barney's represents everything I hate in the world. Granted this is coming from someone whose never spent more than about 40 bucks on an article of clothing (besides shoes). Barney's consists of overpriced  yet cheaply made clothing for elitist assholes.    Let me summarize Barney's in one quick story.   We walk in...I meander over to a rack of women's shirts that are apparently 'on sale'. I find one that looks particulary average. I check the price tag. On sale for 450 bucks. As I'm checking the tag, the shirt starts to rip at the seam even though I'm only gently twisting the tag. Also...notice..."Made in China" on the back. Quality clothing MY ASS.   There's nothing special going on here. If you were to take these clothes and hide them with other 'regular' clothes in a shitty thrift store like Savers, 99% of people wouldn't know which clothes are from actually from Barneys. Conversely...you could take a shirt from Savers...put it in Barneys with a 300 dollar price tag...and some douche bag who drives a Ferrari will pounce on it because he thinks it's trendy.  I hope this place goes out of business. That would make me happy. We've gone in here a few times and the place was deserted each time, I hope that's a sign that people are learning to not get duped by the hype machine. If you shop here, I'm laughing at you.  0/5.

Pink's Hot Dogs was just kind of eh. Since the place is so talked about, and has thousands of reviews for it's original Cali location, I have to admit; I was expecting a dog that would blow my mind. I didn't quite get that. The dog was decent, but was way too loaded with toppings so it had to be eaten with a knife and fork. Kind of just turned into a mess of bread, beef, and mustard that frustrated more than satisfied.   On the other hand, the chili cheese fries were pretty good... but paying $30 bucks for 2 hot dogs, 2 drinks and an order of fries isn't worth it for what you get. It's basically fast food for sit down restaurant prices... which is ass-backwards. It'll probably hit the spot if you're really hungry like we were, but sadly I can't recommend Pinks. 2/5.

What a nice little Thai restaurant! We have been here a few times, and each time the food has been high quality and really good. We got the pad thai with tofu and the sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. They only use white meat chicken and they use nothing but fresh vegetable's for all of their dishes.  There soup is also to die for, especially the Tom Kai Gai.  The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and with fast and efficient service you really can't go wrong here.  This is also an excellent place for take out, they always say 15 minutes, but it's ready in about 10 minutes.  And, if you go to their website they have a 10% off cupon that you can use.  Another cool thing is that you can specify how spicy you want your order, anywhere from 1-5 (5 being the spiciest), which is really a nice feature to customize your order.  Whoo, yay Thai House!  4.5/5

It really couldn't have been any better.    -Groupon (check) -Cool unpretentious waiter (check) -Live music (check) -Amazing menu (double check)  We ventured over to 5th & Wine a few weeks ago after buying our Groupon online for $15 bucks (for $30 worth of food) and haven't stopped talking about it since.  We're not really wine drinkers (craft beer is more our style), so we decided to just focus on the food and order as much as our little stomachs could handle.  Here's what we got and why it was so fabulous:  -Bruschetta.  Next time we go back I think I want to order nothing but the bruschetta, it was that good.  Melt in your mouth savory and soft and just all around a perfect explosion of both texture and flavor.  We only got four of the eight bruschetta offerings, (Apples and brie, Peppercorn steak and horseradish, Tomato basil and mozzarella, and Prosciutto and fig) but each and every one that we tried left our mouth watering.  -5th & Wine burger.  We asked our waiter about this burger, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  We took this comment with a grain of salt since he works for the joint, but after we sank our teeth into the juicy beast ourselves, we realized how right he was.  It was a damn good burger, well deserving of praise.  The fries on the side were also finger lickin' good and we gobbled up every last one of those perfectly fried taters.  -Tomato and Mozzarella panini.  It was everything I thought a panini could be, and more. Crispy on the outside and gooey guts of tomato and cheese on the inside, this was one tasty sandwich, and the side of minestrone soup hit the spot as well.  I wish other mediocre establishments would observe and take notes from this place on how to run a successful restaurant in the valley.  The food, the service and the atmosphere are all impeccable, and unlike some other places, they don't make you pay for valet parking or dress like a wannabe hipster to fit in and look cool (I'm looking at you Postino).

This place is HOT on Yelp for a reason. We couldn't wait any longer and had to go try it after reading so many awesome reviews this past month; and now we must personally thank every person who recommended this place to us:  Thank you my fellow Yelpers... if it weren't for you there is zero chance we ever would have stopped at this unassuming storefront in a pretty rough area of Central Phoenix.   This place has a very 'hole in the wall' sort of vibe... when we first pulled up we kind of had an "Oh... this is it!" sort of reaction. We got scared at first because there was a big 'public notice' sign on the front window; we thought it might have been shut down, but luckily it was just a 'liquor license pending' sign. Whew, that was close. It's a pretty small and cozy place inside. The walls are decorated with some really interesting and fun to look at Mexican paintings and the whole inside just feels authentic; like you just walked into a taco shop in a nice quaint Mexican village. The lady behind the counter and the cook that night were very welcoming and fun to talk to. Upon pondering one of the paintings on the wall she even explained to us the meaning behind it.   First things first... the chips and salsa were flippin great! Thin and crispy with a slightly salted flavor; but even better than the chips are the salsas. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that La Condessa has got the best salsa in town; and the biggest variety too. Out off all the salsa's we tried a few standouts were the peanut, cilantro, and avocado variations.   For our main dish we got one of each taco on the menu... in the spirit of brevity I won't get into each specific taco; but I will say that we loved every single one of them. They each had very unique flavors with a sense of freshness to them, and pretty much zero grease. Each taco was also brim full with meat... they don't skimp on the product here; they give you your money's worth! Next time it might even be tempting to separate the two corn tortillas the tacos come in, and just divvy up the meat to make two tacos out of one!   Last thing that must must must be mentioned is the Horchata. Generally this mysterious white drink is very hit and miss, well here it's a big time hit. It's unique and has all sorts of fresh fruits and spices floating in it... it tasted like some Super-Horchata or something; it was just absolutely to die for and is easily the best I've had. I highly recommend giving it a shot even if you usually don't like the stuff.   La Condessa gets a 4.5/5... rounded down to a 4 for now, just because we want to go back and try the rest of their menu; which at that time if it's anywhere near as good as our first visit this'll be bumped up to a solid 5 stars. Hooray for another great Mexican place in AZ!

Well... couldn't help it... gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit. Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu... this time we tried a quesadilla, an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro, and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans. On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite, and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drink...mmm.   The quesadilla was very different, made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it... damn good. Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas. The two burros we tried were equally tasty... and just like last time the chips were spot on. What's not to love about this place? It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall.   I think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go... especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa; it really is as good as everyone says it is... heaven in a sauce basically. Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back, because I'm hooked.   From what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier... it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth. In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner, instead of a Taco Bell... eh, baby steps I guess. 5/5.

After some recent trouble with my little Hyundai, I decided to take it to the dealership service department and see if they could find out what was making my car sick. I had never been here before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect since my past experience with mechanics and car dealers had been less than exceptional. From the very beginning, I was immediately impressed with the service I received from the guys in the service department. They returned my call right away and they were professional and helpful and took their time to explain things that I would have otherwise not have been able to understand since I know nothing about cars (And I mean nothing). They were able to get my car in right away and were able to fix it up and return it to me within 24 hours. They gave me no trouble at all about the service being covered under warranty (thank God for that wonderful warranty!) and they didn't try to sell me on services or products that I didn't need. I was very impressed and will definitely be taking my car back here if any other issues come up and I will also be keeping this dealership in mind when the time comes to buy a new car.

Jamba is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to chain smoothie places. We are big fans of the Acai antioxidant smoothie, which is unlike the other smoothies that we've tried there. It is super healthy and has a distinct flavor to it which we like because it's not as sweet as their traditional smoothies are. I like going to Jamba because they are always reliable, fast and friendly when we have visited, even if the smoothies are a tad pricey. But, you get what you pay for, and I would much rather pay a little extra for a consistently good smoothie that I know will be delicious than take my chances on an unknown place that most likely won't deliver the goods.

When walking through Scottsdale mall, we usually politely refuse (or ignore in some cases) the sales people outside of the store fronts that want us to try out the latest electronic gadgets or the newest and greatest hand lotion, or a taste of some dried up day old food sample.   A few weeks ago, as we were doing our usual Sunday stroll around the mall, we noticed this place and a few Asian guys in front of the store advertising a free 5 minute shoulder massage. "Sit dow...sit dow...fie minute", they kept saying. Usually we have no problem refusing an offer like this, but the lure of a little massage preview and a room full of cute Asian people was too great an offer to refuse. We both sat down and let them go at it. They immediately dug into our shoulders in a way that hurt a little but felt good at the same time and kept asking, "You lie, you lie?" We said, "Yes, we like, we like!" and before I knew it, I was face down on a table with a little Asian man massaging my whole body. I'm not sure what, if any, technical training these massage therapists have, (if you can even call them that), but whatever they learned from the home country, they learned well! I left feeling so relaxed (just like the name of the joint) and the ache in my lower back was gone as soon as I left. We were so impressed that we went back the next weekend and decided to each get a foot massage. As they pounded and prodded and tickled and tugged on our feet, while we reclined in a big leather chair we couldn't help but think, "This is the life". What they may lack in formal training and education, they make up for in tried and true massage techniques that have been passed down for generations and a sense of professionalism and customer service that you just don't find for this amount of money anywhere else in town.

Eff you McDonalds, eff you!   You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies.   As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time.   After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out.   McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....

Jump Street is pretty much a childhood dream of mine come true. A big ass warehouse where everything is made out of giant trampolines... you gotta be kidding me! Awesome!   Even though my lovely lady and I are well into our 20's... we are still children at heart... so we were more than excited to go and check this place out a couple weeks after it first opened. What you get here is no frills building about the size of a football field, which has giant trampoline floors... there are even trampolines on the wall to jump off of. Additionally there are trampoline dodgeball courts and various other novelties.   You pay a flat rate of about $10 for an hour... and you get to go let loose and bounce around like a little kid. When we went there was a pretty high concentration of high school age kids... but we definitely weren't the only 'adults'... so if you're worried about being a creepy old person if you go... don't sweat it.   We had a lot of fun... being in a building full of trampolines is pretty much just as cool as it sounds (if that's your sort of thing). If you have kids, it might be a fun diversion for them too. We had a great time... but be forewarned; jumping on trampolines is more strenuous and tiring than you might think... after about twenty minutes we were dead tired and heaving for air. Maybe that's what led to us getting our asses kicked by a few high schoolers in a rather lopsided dodgeball match (that's my story and I'm stickin to it).   This is just one of those novelty places... something to do on a random weekend to mix things up a bit. Even if you never go back, it's a fun experience.   3.75/5.

We would have loved to experience this first annual Chandler BBQ event... however due to some piss poor planning we and hundreds of other people were left out in the cold (or should I say hot).   See... this event was supposed to go from 10am-9pm on Saturday, but by 1:30pm when we arrived they announced via megaphone that no more tickets were being sold and they were apparently "out of meat". Please tell me how an event which is supposed to go all day until 9pm blows it load just three hours into the festivities?   To make matters worse, when we were turned away they explained that they'd be re-opening ticket sales at 4pm and more food would be available. So we planned our whole afternoon around this, and wasted time until 4. When we arrived for our second attempt of the day, to our shigrin they changed their minds yet again and reneged on what they had said earlier. Now... tickets were on sale for five bucks... but there was no BBQ!!!! No BBQ at a BBQ Fest... ex-fucking-scuse me? Basically five bucks to walk around and stare at a bunch of empty BBQ reminants... it just didn't make much sense.  So many people drove across town to come here (including us) and I really hope next time they put some more time into the planning of this event... it has promise. Hopefully we'll be able to return next year and actually be able to review the food... and not the ill planned event itself. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Eating healthy and eating out very rarely mesh well together. If presented with the choice of something like a 'Prime Rib Sandwich with Garlic Shoestring Fries' or a 'Roasted Chicken Salad'...there are very few people who would pick the salad over the sandwich under their own free will (excluding people who are under the influence of the newest greatest dieting trend).   My girl and I try to eat healthy...we'll avoid anything that's too over the top; and we strive to find places that focus on being fresh and not overly greasy. That being said, there are limited choices when looking for establishments that cook up low fat food that doesn't taste like old cardboard.   Nourish is definitely going for that niche...the health conscious foodie. In addition they offer pretty extensive options for people on Gluten free diets and Vegans. Don't get scared away though, there's still plenty of options for the rest of us. We tried a few things here; the burger and the tenderloin grilled cheese sandwich. Both don't sound healthy, so I know I'm going against everything I just said about the place; but both meals were very fresh tasting and had zero grease or fat; the food tasted healthy...there's an obvious difference in the type of lean meat used and in the cooking process if you were to compare it to a normal burger at a place like Chilis. It's like night and day. Also their sweet potato fries were quite tasty and were cooked in some way I don't completely understand (air popped?).   All this being said...the food didn't knock our socks off, but it was good for what it was...and for being on the healthier side, I can forgive it a bit. It was a perfectly good meal, and we felt great afterwards...that's more than I can say about a lot of other places we've left bloated and greased out from.  One quick downside to mention is the parking. It's pretty confusing. If you can find the entrance to the underground parking you have to pretty much sprial around this maze of parking spots looking for a 'guest spot', and once you find one you'll have to navigate through the Optima Condo area looking for Nourish...I'm still not quite sure how to find it...we just kind of stumbled into it; so good luck on that.   P.S. Flavored water...some people have mentioned it...the menu talks about it; I don't think ours was flavored at all...not sure if they were out of it or if the flavoring was so mild we just didn't notice...hmm.  3.75/5.

Opening the door to this place is like stepping into a childhood dream you might have after watching Willy Wonka for the first time. Candy everywhere you look...rows and rows of sweet sweet candy. This is without a doubt the biggest candy store I've ever step foot in by far, it's basically the size of a Walgreens, and carries nothing but sweets. My teeth are tingling just thinking about it.   They have candy by the pound (like Sweet Factory at the mall), they have individual pieces of candy, a wall of about a zillion flavors of jellie bellies, and they have pretty much anything you want available in bulk. What's fun about picking out candy here is that there are all sorts of candy you've surely never heard of before, and they are dirt cheap if you buy them individually...we're talking 25 cents a piece or so. This makes it possible to leave with a rather large bag full of goodies for about ten bucks...pretty awesome.  The only reason I'm holding this back from a 5 star review is because they really effed up their grand opening. They kept advertising it, then cancelling it...then advertising it, then cancelling it. The first time we tried to go here (made a special trip way out of our way from the other side of town) they were closed even though we had confirmed the night before online that it was supposed to be their opening day. In order to earn that fifth star they're gonna have to show some consistent customer service over the next few trips I take here.   Candy lovers rejoice...this is your mecca. Go here...even if you aren't as into candy as you were as a kid, this will awaken your inner child. Something tells me that dentists in the 85224 area code are gonna get a sudden jump in business. 4/5.

Ever since Kukuruza Popcorn in AZ Mills shut down I've gone to hell and back to try and find a cheddar popcorn that could stack up to theirs. I used to brave that hell hole of a mall just to fill up on those little kernels of cheesy salty goodness. Well, when AZ Mills started its painfully obvious downward slide towards ghetto-ness, Kukuruza lost it's market and was one of the casualties.   For a couple years now I've yearned for some cheddar popcorn that could compare to Kukuruza's. I had no luck until I found Popcornopolis. It's a new little popcorn shop in Chandler Fashion Square. I heard about it through one of my brothers rants...he was ranting about how people spend way too much money on stuff that should be cheap...his first example was this popcorn place he had seen in the mall (this place) which charges five or six bucks for a tiny bag of popcorn...his rant should have turned me off like it was indented to...but it did the opposite, it put Popcornopolis on my radar.   I decided to go pick some up before seeing a movie this last weekend. I figure I'd go spend about five bucks on some 'expensive' popcorn, yet still save money from what I would pay for underwhelming theater popcorn, go figure. Upon entering, its clear this place has a really artisan appearance...it looked like the type of place you could get some mighty tasty snacks in, just based on looks alone...even if you are paying a little more than usual. We were greeted by one of the workers who asked us if she could 'give us the tour'. Of course we said yes to that! What followed was a unholy barrage of samples of just about every type of popcorn I could imagine. We were given samples of probably 15 or so different flavors of popcorn...we were given so much free samples in fact, that I was almost too stuffed to actually buy some. Just to name a few...here are some we tried:  Cinnamon Toast - Tasted remarkably just like real Cinnamon Toast.  Sour Cream and Onion - Tasted like a potato chip...very strong onion flavor.  Almond - Fresh and crunchy with little pieces of almonds...quite good.  Zebra - Way too rich...too much going on with this one.  Kettle - Perfect mix of salty and sweet...some of the better kettle corn I've tried.  Nacho - If you like spicy, you'll love this...my mouth was on fire after just a couple pops.  Cheddar - And now for the big daddy of them all...the whole reason I tried this place. I'm proud to say that Popcornopolis knows how to brew up a tasty batch of cheddar popcorn. Strong cheesy and buttery flavor...crunchy on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside...with a healthy coating of flaky cheddar cheese powder...I finally found a cheddar popcorn to replace my old flame.   If you're in the Chandler Mall area...I say give this place a try. It is a tad on the pricier side...but at the very least go in and get some free samples. Popcorn if done right can be such a gourmet treat, and Popcornopolis is one of the few places that nails the concept of 'gourmet popcorn'. They also sell some pretty good lucking caramel apples and chocolates, but I didn't leave enough room to try any of those. I hope this place succeeds, so that I'm not stuck with a cheddar popcorn void in my life...every few months I NEED cheddar popcorn, is that so wrong?! In the meantime I better go wipe this yellow cheddar powder off of my upper lip.   4/5.

I'll admit...I've always seen the hot dog as the lowest possible form of meat there is. Even as a kid, hearing playground rumors of what was actually in hot dogs struck me with fear and made the hot dog's more attractive cousin...the hamburger...a much more appealing option for stuffing into my gullet. Sure...I'd have a hot dog once a year or so when I was in the mood, or at the occasional baseball game. But for all intents and purposes, the hot dog was dead to me. Now, thanks to Short Leash Dogs my mild disdain of the hot dog has made a miraculous 180, rising from the recesses of my palette like a phoenix from the ashes.   How could a hot dog be so amazing?   Maybe it's the fresh and local ingredients...or the high quality dogs/sausages they use...or maybe it's the Naan bread. Whatever they're doing...they're doing it right, because when you bite into one of their unique dogs, it's like an explosion of flavor that can't even be compared to the type of hot dogs I grew up on.  So far we've tried a few different styles and they've all been uniquely tasty in their own way. My personal favorite is Beer Hot served Lady style...it might just be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Oh...and if it wasn't enough that their food is orgasmically good, the two owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Someone with a product this good has no right being so genuine and friendly. Honestly, they could be assholes and their food is good enough that it would probably still sell like hot cakes. When a restaurant (or food truck in this case) has amazing food that is matched with friendly service, it creates an environment you want to keep coming back to. Did I mention the prices are pretty cheap too?  Thank you to Short Leash Dogs I am now craving their hot dogs on a weekly basis, at the very least.  We love this place if you can't tell. If you haven't tried it already...GO NOW. My only hope is that they continue to expand and trek to more places around the valley more often...maybe even open up a brick and mortar location somewhere close to where I live; hey I can dream can't I?  5/5.

Last Saturday afternoon we were actually on our way to grab a SLD (Short Leash Dog) at the Phoenix film festival when we received the sad and unfortunate news that the SLD food truck was not going to be able to make it. Oh no! Judging from our hysterical reactions, you'd have thought we just received the worst news of our lives. Man, were we bummed! At this point, we had been craving a hot dog for the better part of the day; so much so that any other type of food was just simply not going to cut it. I'm not kidding, you could have put a filet mignon in front of our faces and we would have passed. We wanted some dogs!! (And not just any old crappy hot dog).   Luckily for us, we knew about Maui Dog and headed right over. We were charmed right off the bat with the colorful exterior and handwritten drive through menu. The inside is just as fun and quirky as the outside with surfboards and random Hawaiian decor abounding from floor to ceiling. The owner struck us as a very cool ex-hippy type dude who was very nice and accommodating. We ordered three dogs in total; one Hana dog, one Sweet and Spicy dog and another beef dog that we topped with pretty much every topping available. These dogs are definitely not your grandma's hot dog! The combination of tropical toppings such as coconut, mango and pineapple colliding with the juicy meat of the dog was a perfect mixture of sweet, salty and spicy. I think the Hana dog was my personal favorite, but I don't think you could go wrong with any dog here. And don't let me forget to mention the fries! They were out of tater tots that day, but the fries were just as amazing, hand cut and freshly made, we couldn't have asked for a better compliment to go with our dogs.   Tempted to give this place 5 stars, but we're going to hold off for now until we can go back and try some more creations on the menu and hopefully get our hands on some of those tots!  This place definitely lives up to the hype, so the next time you're craving a new age dog head on over and show them some Yelp love!

So, first things first...the ice cream is amazing. The idea that I can pick out my own milk/cream to be used to make the ice cream is very cool. In fact, as someone who can't handle too much sweet or rich food all at once...being able to pick low fat milk as my ice cream base resulted in me actually for the first time ever being able to finish my entire cup of ice cream. This is nice compared to my standard operating procedure at places like Cold Stone where I get the smallest size possible, then finish about 25% of it due to fat/sugar exhaustion.   That all being said, what pushes this place into AWESOME territory is the owner and staff. The owner exudes a sense of excitement about what he's doing that's beyond contagious. Upon ordering, my wife and I received high fives commending our ice cream creations being good choices. He also made it a point to offer to re-make for free anything we didn't like. The laughter, smiling, dancing and general cheer that came from the three people working there was just absolutely infectious. The kicker here, is that it all seemed so genuine. I've been to many places that force employees to be cheery, and I usually tend to see straight through it as an act...but in this case the exact opposite is true.   The cherry on top of this experience is that when my wife and I were enjoying our ice cream, the owner saw that my mother in law didn't order anything...and promptly brought her over and gave her a free banana popsicle that he had just made in the back. So cool. There is a reason that so many reviews mention the owner...he's got that rare ability to inspire happiness. Hell, I think I'd pay money to go here and just talk to the guy for a few minutes when I'm having a bad day.   Go here...this is the type of place that deserves to do great.

This new gourmet popcorn place really gets it right. I've tried 7 of their flavors so far and have been pretty impressed with all of them. They have a way of packing so much flavor into their popcorn that when you bite into each kernel, it's like a little flavor explosion goes off in your mouth. Here's a little breakdown of the flavors I've tried so far:  Beer Cheddar - Holy Hell. Top ten things I've ever put in my mouth. Beer and Cheese in popcorn? You gotta be kidding. Ridiculously good.   Jalapeno Cheddar - Not too spicy, a real nice soft Jalapeno flavor. Very good.  Dill Pickle - Super flavorful pickle flavor. If you like dill pickles, you'll like this.  Spicy Carmel - Really interesting to have a slightly spicy twist on the normal sweet carmel flavor. Another winner.  Kettle - They got just the right mix of sweet and salty, one of the better Kettle popcorns I've tried.  Spicy Buffalo Wings - Woah, spicy! I like that something labeled spicy is actually genuinely spicy for a change. Amazing flavor on this one as well, but only try this if you can handle a good amount of spice.  Meyer Lemon - Good Lemon flavor. I'm not a big fan of sweet candy'ish popcorn like this, so it wasn't my thing...but if you are into sweeter popcorn you'd probably love this.  Overall, this is an awesome new local business that you need to check out if you're in the area. I'm already pretty much addicted to it. My new pre-movie routine will now consist of getting a really good bag of popcorn here and taking it to the movie theater with me. Can't beat getting a decent size bag of high quality popcorn here for about the same price that you'd pay for the inconsistent stuff at the movies.   4.5/5 stars.

This place reminds me of Windsor in Phoenix quite a bit, but I think has a bit more of an exciting and diverse menu (Windsor has great food, but I find the menu a bit limited). It's really cool to have a place like this in North Scottsdale, when most of the hip new places seem to be in the Arcadia area. The stand out dish here for us is easily the Crispy Brussels Sprout leaves. They are fried up to a nice crisp and tossed with golden raisins, pecorino, and something else sweet which I couldn't put my finger on. They are LEGIT. If you don't like Brussels Sprouts, they will change your mind.   Service was A+, food was great, very nice and chic decor...overall I was extremely impressed.   Judging by the crowds I've been seeing here, I think most people tend to agree as well.   4.5/5

The Stand is great. It's like a wet dream of a fast food establishment. Fresh and quality ingredients, good service, and decent prices. You can't go wrong with their tacos or burger; both are solid (Chicken tacos are a personal favorite). Milk Shakes are quality too (especially salted caramel). In a perfect world, the Burger Kings and McDonalds out there would be replaced with establishments like this. Nothing crazy, just good solid food made well.   One huge plus side here too is that they are great for people who must eat Gluten Free. Pretty much everything on the menu is either already gluten free (all the tacos, fries, chips) or can be made that way (the burger). They even have gluten free hamburger buns, which I don't see at too many places.   I'd love to see this place be successful, because fast food that is actually GOOD is in short supply. It'd be great to see places like this start popping up more often.   (Sad side note...this used to be the building where Maui Dog was...hate to see that place go, thought it was great; but glad the building was taken over with something else good like this)

GO NOW.   This is the first place in quite a long time to blow my socks off. Every dish we tried was a flavor explosion to the extreme. The second you try a dish here you can tell they aren't taking any shortcuts in the kitchen. They ooze authenticity and quality that is lacking at so many other local Chinese joints.   I've been daydreaming about this food daily since first checking it out, no joke at all. There is magic brewing in this non-descript building on Apache. The bar has been raised people. Try this place, and you will be hooked.   Tempe folks...if you let this place fail, I may never forgive you.   5/5
