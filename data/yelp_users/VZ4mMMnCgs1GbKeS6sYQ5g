Great lunch place- I've been to this location a few times for lunch and it's always slow enough to get in and out of but not so slow you are skeeved out to eat there.   The lunch specials are the right size, the right price and they are fast. If you want to hang out for a while they keep filling up your tea (the best way to get in good with me) or if you gotta run, they hook it up.   I think most everyone already knows the Streets of NY menu and the food here lives up. Good stuff, consistent, fresh and yummy.   That is all!

The wife and I have been going to this Quiznos for a while and have seen it's ups and downs. We went this week and were pretty surprised that they seem to have their act (back) together. People working were pretty friendly, they made the sandwiches right and all went as planned- shouldn't be such a big deal but these days all going as planned seems to be hard to find. Anyway, it was cool, they were cool, the sandwiches were hot- yum!

Men's wearhouse has always been really hit or miss for me- usually more miss than hit. Had a bad expeerince with the tuxes for my wedding. Same thing with my brother in laws wedding. Same thing with a few other trips. Somehow, this trip was a completely different experience.   Had to get a shirt and tie for a "dress nice please" event so I figured, what the H. Stopped in and was greeted by Carmello. Said a nice hello and let me do my thang. After I couldn't find the shirt I was looking for he jumped in to help- The dude was awesome, by far the best service experience I have ever had at any one of their stores. I got my shirt, a matching tie and a new belt, all for about $100- not bad.   He took my measurements right so I got stuff that is comfortable too (kind of the key to getting me to wear it a second time) and was that perfect balance of offering suggestions combined with actually listening to what I was saying. I can honestly say this guy will bring me back here!

I was totally surprised by this place. Went with the wife to pick up some inexpensive office furniture and the selection was really good- and they had way nicer stuff than I would have expected.   The guy in the furniture department was one of the nicer I have dealt with in a department store in a long time. The cashier looked like I should be thankful that she was awake, but she rang us up right, so I guess that was all I needed.   They carried out the furniture and loaded it up and to top it all off we had a 20% off coupon for the whole order so cheap became damn cheap... sweet!

This review is a tough one for me. For years and years I have hated discount tire- not as a customer but as a small business competitor. I owned a repair shop up until about 5 years ago and grew to despise all that they represented, kind of like the Wal-Mart of the tire world. Nevertheless in the interest of an honest review here goes:  The wife's car got a flat last night, too late to do anything about it, I threw the spare (which I ALWAYS check the pressure on) on and drove it home. Looked up online last night and found the tire I needed in stock at this location.   Called this morning 10 minutes before they opened and actually got a helpful employee who confirmed they had the tire. It was my plan to just drop the loose wheel off and swing back in a few hours to get it and put it back on myself. When I got there I walked in, placed my order, paid my bill and went to get the wheel and leave it by their door. The salesman jumped out from behind the counter, threw on some gloves and took the wheel around for me- nice... this is something I would have done for a customer.   He brought it around and told me that it would only be about 20 minutes or so and I could wait- Sweet, maybe my day is not totally screwed this early in the morning. I sit down, call the wife, try not to take too much credit for getting this whole thing sorted out quickly and wait :)  The icing on the cake of my story- the guy takes my keys, pulls the car around, puts the wheel on, puts away the spare and checks the pressure and torque on all of the remaining wheels- Also something I would have done in the past.   All in all a really good experience, and on top of it all, they did it cheaper than I could have done it by calling up anyone I still know in the business. Damn you and your great prices, quick service and streamlined processes!!!  Anyway, in my honest opinion, they are hard to beat.

Discount is just damn good at what they do. Called at 8am, showed up at 8:45am, drove off with 2 new tires mounted & balanced at 9:15am. And they had the best price I found. Seriously, the place is one big machine.

Ahhhh, Denny's. Growing up in South FL totally ruined Denny's for me- they were just not nice places to go eat. BUT I am pleased to report this place is totally what Denny's should be in a perfect world.   Like a month ago, the wife says "Let's go to the Denny's up the street". Holy crap I thought, as flashbacks from FL started to work their way in to my head. Needless to say, since it was the wife's idea- We hit Denny's.   We walk in and it's clean- I'll take it. We have a friendly lady get us a booth- even better. Waitress comes over, a totally sweet, older lady who is wonderfully sweet to the little one- Go Denny's I'm thinking. We order our appropriately inexpensive food and sip our endless coffee- maybe I was wrong about Denny's I think. Food comes, just as advertised. I got a grand slam, the wife gets a breakfast burrito and the little one gets a kids grand slam- Ya know what? The food was really good. We do our thing, pay our bill and peace out- Totally great experience.   I must say, I am happy to have given Denny's a second chance. It is just right for a quick, easy, cheap breakfast. We have been back a bunch of times since then and it's been the same each time. All I can say is Yay!

Why, why, WHY has no one told me about this place! This place is EXACTLY what I want when I go out to breakfast!  The location: Totally tucked into that strip mall at 4oth & Greenway where most people (including me) never get past Starbucks and The Gelato Spot. Small inside, but feels cozy.   The service: Awesome- nice ladies who fill up your coffee, are sweet to your kid and know that what they do is based on immediately making you feel comfortable. On a related note for those of you with kids- There is NOTHING I appreciate more at a restaurant than a server who 1) gets your kids food out as soon as possible. Eating kid = happy kid and 2) hands YOU the hot plate so you can take care of it, rather than dropping the plate in front of your 2 year old, announcing it's hot and leaving. DUH!  The food: Fantastic- I had the chicken and veggie skillet. I never order skillets because they are always greasy and loaded with cheese. I took a risk and it paid off! Perfect combo of yummy but  not, I need to purge after this!  The price: Just right, a LOT of food for not  a lot of money. Me, the wife, and our full size 2 year old ate for under $25. And let's just say I took food home- NEVER happens :)  The customers: Totally cool- the place is full of regulars who were all nice to our little one. It didn't hurt that he went table to table saying goodbye on our way out, but nothing makes me want to smash a face as much as a person who is rude to my kid so mad props to the regs!  All in all, this place  is just my speed and we will be back... A LOT!

This place was between decent enough and ehh... I'm totally up for a good dive bar experience once in a while, but dive bars are supposed to be cheap and this place is not. I went last night for a going away party and ordered a beer, a double shot of jager (for the guy going away :) and a diet coke- $18. It was clean enough, there was good music, LOTS of games on, even the guys at the open mic weren't bad, but I thought these places are supposed to be about drinking cheap. Oh well, if you go stick to bud light in a bottle :(

Ahhhh Chompies. I have been to the Chompies around the valley for years now and all of them are fantastic. The place is ALWAYS busy and what it occasionally lacks in bright eyed, smiling servers, it totally makes up for in consistently GOOD FOOD! I love their bagels, their soups, the sandwiches are almost too much to eat at once, the salads are great and if you stop in for breakfast, the omelettes are... well let's say I have literally written home about them. Prices are more than fair for what you get and they are fast!   This is one of those places that works for a casual client meeting spot, a meal with the family (it's actually loud enough that the wife and I don't have to panic when our 2 year old has a freak out) or a quick bite on your own. I don't know why, but this is one of those places where you see lots of people eating by themselves and it doesn't look sad. The take out counter is quick and I seriously can't say enough about how much I like the food.... seriously!

This place was really cool. Went for lunch today with a friend who is a regular there. The place was not busy at all at around 1 which was nice, we got our order in and sat down right away. The cashier was really nice, took our order, was friendly and seems to be really appreciative for regulars.   Both my friend and I got the Thanksgiving sub which rocked.... you could pretty much put cranberry sauce on anything and I would eat it, but this I really enjoyed every bite of. It's basically a turkey sub with cranberry sauce and a sage aioli- bomb-diggety!  All in all, two sandwiches with sides and two drinks was $17.50ish- about the same as a couple footlongs from subway which is cool. The atmosphere is nice, laid back with good music, the people check in with you, but not so much that it's annoying, so points there too.   I am looking forward to stopping in again for coffee!

Ahhhh, sweet, sweet Guido's.   This place rocks. Just met a friend for lunch and had the prosciutto & Provolone and some fries... I know, I know- but they are all worth it. I can't say enough about how great the food is here. I used to go way more often when I lived closer, but I still try to get back whenever I can.   It's a nice little place with indoor and outdoor seating, not enough to be crazy, just enough to fill the place up right. They are quick enough for a business lunch and I promise if you take a client here, they will thank you and want to bring people back.   The owner is ALWAYS there, and is always watching over the place, something I find very admirable and effective. While I was there, I watched him walking through the place straightening out, a big plus for me.   The prices are in line with a sub shop of much lesser quality so for the same money you can get real Italian stuff :) Definitely worth stopping in if you like good food and laid back atmosphere.

I am a big fan of Chipotle... nothing new there. The only reason I ever hesitate to eat here (especially, this location) is because it is so damn busy... However, today, for the first time I used their fax order form- Totally awesome. I faxed it in, I called to confirm, I got there, the lady asked my name, handed me my bag, I paid and I left. I almost wanted to tease the suckers still in line.   This is officially now the ONLY way I will order Chipotle. Score one for me and my time!!!

I so don't usually do places like this but I have to say it's pretty damn good. The service is great, the prices are very reasonable and the food is awesome.  I have a friend who always wants to meet here and I went for my second time today. I had the ham and cheese sandwich with the tomato bread salad- kicked ass.... and it was like $7!  The service has been really good both times I've been, the people that bring the food to you have a real smile, and when they ask if there is anything else they can get you- they actually stand still long enough to listen to your answer.   I am so sick of going to places that are so busy being really cool and overpriced that they forget to give you good food so this place is refreshing- Score Wildflower Bread Company!

Went to happy hour here with some clients and it was great. Three rounds of drinks plus everyone ordered off their appetizer menu and the bill was $85... not bad. The place filled up a lot while I was there, apparently it's a pretty popular happy hour hang out- I will definitely do it again.   Myself and client #1 got the fish tacos (w/ Mahi Mahi), they were great- kind of a build your own deal on the plate which I liked. Client #2 got the green chili pork stew which he liked and I can personally say is awesome.   Service was good and the atmosphere is comfy. Great place, a bit off the beaten path but still near old town.

This place is great! I have used them for years- my home, friends' places, rentals, everything and they have never disappointed.   They use steam and a solution that is not some crazy chemical dealy so you don't feel like a planet killer. They have always been on time, the guys are cool, they do what you ask for and don't put some hard sell on you for any add ons or undercoating or any of that crap.   I had my living room and master bedroom done, had them pre-scrub the high traffic areas and clean the dryer vent and it came to $160 total. Great price and the carpets look awesome!   Do yourself a favor and use them!!

We had dined in here years ago and were not thrilled about it, but this place is super close to our house so the wife and I decided to give it a second shot- Better! We got some wings, a turkey sandwich, a gyro and a salad and they were all surprisingly good. Prices are in line with what you would expect and they only have a $1.95 delivery charge which is cool. My wife placed the order and said that the person on the phone was one of the nicest people that have taken a delivery order in general in a long time... so they get points for making the wife happy :)  Definitely a good option for those "no way we're cooking" nights.

This place is really cool. I was invited to play in a charity tournament here with a friend and had a total blast. *Disclaimer- I am totally not a serious golfer but even from a wannabe golfers perspective it was damn fun!   The course has a ton of rolling hills so it's definitely challenging. They are great about having the drink carts circling regularly and the service is great from the second you drop off your clubs.   One piece of advice is to plan for a full day here. It took us about 6 hours for the full 18 holes. Otherwise... go, play!!

I love this place. I haven't been in years but I went this afternoon with some friends I used to work with and it was still just as awesome. It's really rare that small places like this are as good as you remember so I give them a lot of credit. The place looks great, it's clean and the food is fantastic. I got my old favorite, #43 a chicken sandwhich on a wheat wrap and a side of their pasta salad and it brought me right back. Oh and one of my other personal favorites- REAL ICED TEA!! None of that nasty fake stuff. Prices are perfect for the times we are in, the place is always busy but really fast with the food and the atmosphere is cozy... all in all a great place to stop in for lunch by yourself, with friends or even with a client.

This place is the shiznit-o-bam-snip-snap-sack!  By far my favorite for Italian and for service! When the wife and I want to go out and have a great dinner and be taken awesome care of- it's a Veneto Night. We have been here dozens and dozens of times, they do a wine tasting series through the summer and we haven't missed one in the last 6 years! I can honestly say that in all of my visits here they have NEVER had an "off" night. The food is consistent, the service is the best and it is all at a completely reasonable price. Nevertheless, on to my most recent experience:   It was great! The wife and I went for dinner on our anniversary and while we love bringing our little one with us here, it was great being alone :)  We had the eggplant gratin (bomb!) and the pasta fagioli soup to start and followed those up with the gnocchi and linguini with red sauce and scallops, fish, mussels and shrimp and all I have to say is Damn! I love homemade pasta and I love it even more when it is smothered in all things good from the sea. The wife's gnocchi was great, this is the only place she will order it from. The brought us some tiramisu with a candle for our anniversary which was nice. All that plus a few glasses of wine and we didn't even hit $90.   I don't want to get into novel length here, but I cannot say enough about how great this place is. The owners are ALWAYS there, they never turn over the staff (always a good sign) and their food is consistently fantastic. I can't list everything that I have eaten here but it's a lot and it has all been good.... I even enjoyed the squid ink risotto :)  Anyway, please do yourself a favor and go here. Enjoy the people, enjoy the food and tell the world.... it's that good!

I never would have known this place existed and that would have sucked- if it wasn't for my super duper in the know wife. Took her and a couple of clients here today and the place was awesome!  Cool people, very laid back atmosphere, kick ass food and at a totally fair price. I could stop there but I will go on....  The guy who met us at the door- cool. Our waitress- cool. The nice lady who filled up my tea like 7 times without giving me the "seriously dude" look- yup, cool.   On the location- We met at 11:30- way early by downtown lunch standards so I was kinda freaked out from the look of things out front, not much happening. Once we got inside, it made me feel like I had stumbled into the kind of place I wanna be in. Nice and clean, but totally got that old converted house feeling (in a good way). Oh, and by 12:30 when we left- packed!  The food- Yum! At our table there were two PLT's (one of them mine), basically prosciutto, lettuce & tomato, a pastrami sandwich and another sammy that I cannot recall. What I can recall is that everyone liked them- me especially. It was great... perfectly toasted bread, great fillings and a nice little salad. And for desert since my lady companions insisted- a crepe suzette and a crepe with nutella. And of course- damn!  The price- Bout $60 for all 4 of us. I would have spent that easily at some place that I would not have been half as happy with.   Final thought- go, eat, drink tea and enjoy!

I've been to this Pita Jungle a million times... they are easily my all time number 1 pick for quality and consistency of their food, great value for the money, great atmosphere, and anything else you could think of for a cool, hip place to eat "not bad for you" food. The one thing that consistently lacks is the service, I swear it is like they hand out a new hire book that tells their servers to be aloof. BUT WAIT!!! This afternoon, I met the wife for a quick bite and had Nick for a server- the dude is awesome! He's not all up in your bidnez awesome, but laid back awesome. I am so totally thrilled to be able to write about a good service experience here because I really do love this place.   So even on it's worst service day, I would still eat here, but I am stoked to have someone I can ask for when I go next time (probably next week :)  Eat here people!

This place is gorgeous!   Went recently and did the appetizers at the bar thing and it was great. It was very slow when we were there which was nice- our server had a lot of personality and was really attentive.   ALL the appetizers were all half off and they were delicious, their homemade sausage is awesome and the sliced meats were nice and fresh.  They have a bunch of wines at $7 a glass and they are real pours!   All in all a great experience, really nice atmosphere and they were surprisingly laid back with our 2yo occasionally acting like a maniac. Lots of good food and drinks for cheap... yay!

This place is a must after every Pita jungle trip (and those are often!). Just went with the wife and shared an Oatmeal Raisin... yum! Never really tried a flavor I haven't liked so as far as I'm concerned it's all good.   The place is always clean, the peeps are always friendly (quick with a sample spoonful :) and it's cooold in there, yay!

Went here a few days ago to meet a client for a quick lunch. This place is a lunch machine- They take your order fast (and accurate) have your food up and let you loose into the dining area. The prices are reasonable, the service is always friendly and the food is really good. I got the chicken salad sandwich on rye (yum) and their chicken chili. My client got the turkey sandwich and chicken soup and gave both high marks. Oh and I took home roast beef and broccoli cheese soup for the wife and she loved it. Definitely one of my favorite "meet you in the middle" places.

I totally love this Subway location. It is one of the cleaner ones I have been in and I have had a lot of good experiences here. The owner is always around, totally nice and her employees seem to have some personality which is a plus for me. They are pretty much always busy, but I don't think I have ever spent what I would consider to be too long there in line. I completely accept that you always run the risk of a so so service experience when it comes to fast food, but I have had too many good experiences here not to write about it.

I love Barros! Their pizza is awesome, love the dough and they use quality stuff to top it. Their wings are my favorite, that perfect balance of crunchy and smothery. Even their sandwiches are good, lots of stuff in them and I love that they use the shredded mozzarella cheese.   We order from them more often than I would care to admit and they are probably the most consistent pizza place I have found. They are not the cheapest around, but I am a believer in that whole "get what you pay for" philosophy.   They seem to have really good luck with the drivers, they are always cool.  I hate when the person dropping off your food looks like they should be in an anti-drug ad so I give them points for not letting that aspect slide over time.   All in all damn good for a pizza night at home!

This place is pretty cool and definitely laid back. I am a total amateur and I have really enjoyed every time I have been here. Parking is easy, the course and shop are laid out well and I have played the course and gone just to hit balls at the driving range. It's cheap and a lot of fun.

This place is pretty cool as sports bars go. I went for a few beers last night  with a friend and if you go when there's no game on the place is pretty chill.   They have lots of beers on tap and the food is pretty good too. I have had the turkey burger a few times and it's great, good fries too. The service is definitely hit or miss, I have had great, terrible and a few in between so know that going in.   Otherwise the atmosphere is just what you want in a sports bar, I prefer laid back but I am actually looking forward to stopping in to watch a game.

Met a friend for lunch here this week and it was just plain Meh (Thanks for the perfect word Yelp). It was a Monday afternoon so the place was totally dead which can either be a really cool thing (great, attentive service) or not so great ("hello, hello" echoing through the place) - it was the latter.   I got a chicken sandwich, pretty safe usually and it wasn't half bad.. it just wasn't half good either. They serve that crappy syrupy iced tea which I hate, and on top of that they disappear when you are out of your drink which is even more insulting when the place is empty.   I suppose this place does what it is supposed to at a basic level- they feed you and you don't die, but I will make it a point to head somewhere else. Or I'll just stop in for the overpriced games :)

So I am totally not a dry cleaner aficionado, but this place is cool.   It's a total no frill type of experience- You go in and drop your stuff off, they're friendly enough and you leave. You come back and it's done when they said it would be. It's cheap and they never lose anything or mess anything up.   Just what I want in a dry cleaner, that's it... use them, they get my vote :)

Geez, given all of the happy people out there, I actually feel bad about giving a low grade, but in the interest of an honest review I am gonna be, well, honest.   I do not like this place- I have been a million times (to a few of them), I have family who just love it- but I just cringe every time I hear I will have to go.   First off, I totally get why this place is so popular, it's cheap, the food is not totally toxic and it has this comfy, old timey feel... I hear.   That being said, I just feel like all of the food is totally cheap, not in the yay a deal way, but rather, everything tastes like cheap, low quality ingredients. I went out on a limb today and ordered the veggie skillet- semi healthy I am thinking, man was I wrong! The veggies weren't fresh at all and they were damn, damn greasy. The eggs were eggs, and then it looked like someone threw a bunch of cold grated cheddar on top... eww.   On to the service- I will say that I have had a (really) few good service experiences here, but they are pretty few and far between. For some reason, I always see people walking around with the coffee, but they do that whole avoid eye contact thing and I sit around without any coffee. The servers always seem like you are the table that is gonna push them over the edge because they are hanging on by a string.   For some reason, it just never feels like a nice experience, so I will continue subtly sending my message to family by making faces anytime I hear this place on the table for the meeting spot to eat.

I admit I don't think of this place as often as I should when it's time to get a bite but I have had a lot of good experiences here.  I have only been for lunch but I have been 4 or 5 times.   Their prices are very reasonable, their food is good, fresh and one of my priorities- consistent. Almost every time I have been I have had the chopped Aegean salad and it's awesome- it's big, really cold, yummy, loaded with good stuff and well, big! I do make it a point to try a bite of other dishes (depending on who I am there with :) and I have yet to be disappointed. Their lentil soup is great and they have this grilled artichoke that is the shiz.   The service is always good and they are never too busy around the lunching hours so it works out great for quick or client meetings.   Do yourself a favor and try it out, you will spend about the same as a chain for lunch and you will make a much better impression on whoever you go with ;)

I have been here a few times, most recently today- I have a friend who loves to go here. This place is not bad by any means, it is the ultimate epitome of average, nondescript, personality-less and blah.   The food is not bad, I had the BBQ chicken salad today, my buddy got the sliders, and I have had the wraps in the past- all actually pretty good. Their prices are about average (go figure) and the food is quick enough for a work lunch.   I just cannot get over how blah the whole damn experience is. The servers ALL seem totally uninspired, there is NO atmosphere, and the entire experience is forgotten the second you walk out the door.   Do yourself a favor and unless you have a friend who loves this place- PASS!

I do NOT like Wells Fargo banks!   I am not writing about this branch specifically, I am writing about EVERY one I have been in within the last year or so. I have a business account here that has myself and my 2 other business partners on it. The only interaction I ever really need to have is depositing rent checks- that's it. It should be so simple, but for some reason it NEVER is! Whether I drive up or walk in, it is by far the longest deposit process of any bank I have ever been to. For reals, it takes me about 5-7 minutes (yes I have timed it) once I am at the teller window.   So today, I walk in and hand over my check and my slip. After a looooong pause (and way more typing than I believe is required to process my deposit) she asks me to confirm my home address, NOT the business address on the account. I do it, realizing later that I just confirmed some marketing departments opportunity to flood me with crap mail. Then she asks me to confirm my name... yes my name. I do it. She then asks me to sign the check right below where I have clearly written "For Deposit Only" and the account number. I do it. Looooooooong pause........ more typing.   "You're all set, have a great day, sorry I stole 7 minutes of your life" (I added that last part).   Wells Fargo, I am NOT your fan! Peace out!

This place is awesome! It's a real barber shop experience... and not just the little candy cane looking spinny thing (they don't have one, consider it a real, modern, barber shop experience).   A basic haircut costs $21 (and they offer shaves and they have lots of other packages too) and you get the haircut, with scissors and combs and stuff, not just a quick clipper session, a shampoo, a hot towel on the head, a kick ass shoulder and head massage and they even trim sideburns and neck lines with a straight razor.   You walk in and they know who you are, they remember what you like and they get you in and out. Oh, and I almost forgot, each chair has its own flat screen and direct TV receiver- saweet!    You don't really need an appointment, it's the type of place where they will find a way to get you in whatever time you go, very laid back which is always a major plus in my book. And not to get too sappy, but they give a $1 discount if you come in with your son, father or grandfather which I love. I am actually looking forward to bringing my 2 year old in as soon as I am sure he wouldn't just go straight for the shaving cream and razors!  Definitely a keeper for me, I would highly recommend stopping in for a cut.

This place rocks. Got my hair cut last week and it was a great experience. And to top it off, they dropped their prices. Sweeet!

I am truly disappointed with Office Max. About 3 years ago, I went in to get some copies made and had a great experience- That was ONCE and 3 YEARS AGO. It has gotten progressively worse, I am actually mad at myself for not doing something different sooner.   I put out a print newsletter every month to about 110 people and EVERY month I stop in to get my printing done at THIS store because my company has contract pricing. I have just put up with the crap service because the pricing was good, but I can't bear to give any more of my money to this place, today was the straw of straws.   I go in and find the "Impress" counter completely unattended. I park it and wait, I see a few employees walk by in the distance and I can only say that they must train people on the whole no eye contact thing. Eventually, a guy walks in with his big drink he got on his break and asks me if I've been helped. "Not Yet" I say as he walks past, he takes the disk and pops it in. About a minute later, the grumpy guy that I try to avoid because he depresses me walks in (Seriously, I have only seen this guy when I am in this store and I feel like I know every damn ache and pain in the guy's life) and guy #1 hands me off. "How Many?" guy #2 asks. "110 in color" I respond (I'm all excited because this is my first newsletter in color). He looks at me like I am insane and says "They're 99 cents each!?!" as if I am gonna run off crying. "OK, and I need them folded also" I respond. By the way, this is all in the presence of guy #1 who handed me off.   The printer starts jamming and I watch as my stuff finishes and sits there. I am standing 5 feet from the counter watching guy #1 & guy #2 talking about something that did not seem anywhere near as important as they were making it out to be. I see guy #2 take a glance over at my copies, clock out and walk away. By now, guy #1 has happily discovered that there is an attractive lady that has wandered over to the counter and he is all over it. Again, I sit and listen to guy talking now to this lady in way greater detail than she is even interested in... and for me to notice body language like that it must be obvious.   Eventually, guy makes his way over to my stuff, hits the folding machine and goes to ring me up. He puts everything in and presents me with a total that is $1.99 each copy (plus folding) = about $225. "What happened to 99 cents each?" I ask. "Oh, that was um, per side" he responds. Come on, maybe that works with a foreign tourist or something, but  seriously, come on! "Don't you think that would have been an important detail to mention before the printing?" I ask. Guy looks annoyed, looks down, hits some buttons like they owe him money and presents me with a new total at 99 cents each.  I pay, I leave and I will NEVER go back.   I don't want people to freak out with joy when I walk in, but for gods sake, PLEASE recognize the fact that I have been coming in every month for 3 YEARS! Also, don't pull some stupid price change on me at the register! Finally, have at least a basic shred of customer service... SERVICE! I swear this place is like a huge Kinko's- everyone that works there truly believes that they are doing you a favor by giving you their time!   Anyhoo, I am done, and I would recommend finding some- no ANYplace else for printing.

My Quizno's experience today was just weird- I stopped in for a sandwich between appointments and while my sandwich was good (tuna on wheat with pickles and black olives... yum!) the staff was, um, interesting. ALL of the people working there were mumblers, like hardcore mumblers. I thought the guy in front of me was being a jerk for saying huh a million times, but then I realized that the lady was talking to the sandwich and was barely audible. I moved on to the post toasting station and wouldn't you know it- same thing. And guess what, the dude ringing me up- SAME THING! I have never had such a bizarre experience before. Where the H are the people who look at you when they talk, let alone smile at you! I'm takin a Quizno's break for a while.

Absolutely awesome experience here! Went in to get a watch battery replaced and also had them look at a broken necklace clasp. I had the necklace sitting in a drawer for months because I thought it would be an expensive fix. Walked in, spoke to the owner, and in the time it took him to replace my watch battery, he had his guy fix the necklace- turned out it was just a broken spring.   I was in and out in 15 minutes, with a working watch and a repaired necklace, all for $5. Awesome service, good conversation and they took great care of me!
