This is the only nail salon I would go to whether I'm out of town I wouldn't get my nails anywhere else I would rather wait haha. Well, if it wasn't for Nikki she does an amazing job. Each time I come in she never fails on how I want it & how I like it.. By far Nikki is my favorite nail technician of all. I definitely recommend her to anyone (:

Yaayy. Just got CenturyLink internet hookup at home.. I couldn't thank enough to this Chandler location for sending me the right 2 guys. The 2 technicians were so kind, friendly & very helpful even assured me that Cox cable & Cox internet will not interfere with CenturyLink internet at my household. They also guided me through steps if there is any issues in the future or simply give them a call. I was scared that two different internet service in the same household will not work but sure enough they gave me a clear mind to know that this will workout after all.. Oh & one of the two techs happen to be the same ethnic, Lao, as I so that was cool... Now I have to wait to see if the internet will hold up on speed. Cox lags way to much so that was the reason why I wanted to give CenuryLink a try. Hope all goes well but shall wait & see.... To be continued with results (:

I brought in my 09 Scion XB to replace the recall parts.. When it was finished I remember it was the service manager who drove the car out.. I notice there was a big dent in the front left fender, it was pushed in bad. I pointed it out and told him it wasn't there before I brought it in and can you fix it, he told me all I need to do is have someone push it out and it'll go pop back in place... Just before dark I got home, had someone try to pop it in place and it didn't go so well like he said still looks bad. I'm so disappointed in myself I shouldn't listen to him I should of have him take the car back and do it for me. Now the car looks ugly thanks for that pushed in fender (SMH) I will never go back for any service or recommend this location .
