Quality and service is terrible here. There is way many better Italian food restaurants in the valley.   I got the egg plant parmesan and it looked like my 7 year old tried to make it or it came from a box. The sauce was so so. It's definitely more of a tourist attraction or a place for people who haven't eaten real Italian food. Save your money, get a can of Chef Boyardee. It tastes way better!

Good food. The service was extremely slow and the hostess couldn't get her wait times anywhere near correct. The bartender was slower than a snail.

Great service and food was amazing. I got the Mongolian beef lunch special. The portion was enormous and I took half of it with me (cold Chinese food makes a great snack.) The Mongolian beef was perfectly spicy. The hot and sour soup was delicious as well... And they gave me a free refill on it too. My drink was never more than halfway empty and I felt like I was being treated like a king. I will definitely be going back.

Great Kosher pizza! One of the very few pizza places where I actually eat the crust as well. Full of flavor and a must try. Me and the wife ordered the Godfather. It was packed full of flavor!  Can't wait to try their other items on the menu!

I love the chicken fried steak! Me and the wife could have definitely split it. It would have been plenty for 2 people. The ambience is ok but the food makes up for it.   As all the other reviews say "get the chicken fried steak!"

Loved it. Service was top-notch and the food was fabulous. I can't believe I saw negative reviews on here. The food is very authentic.  It's definitely not for those on a budget.

Too be 100% honest it isn't all that bad. The food was decent. They do have a small selection but it is only $5 for all you can eat.  I'm giving them 5 stars because all the reviews on here is expecting 5 star dining for $5.. a bit unfair for an all you can eat place.

Great pizza, fantastic wings and great service. I always order my wings with extra sauce so they reheat in the oven without becoming too dry. With the local chain I used to order from switching their ingredients to cheaper ones and changing over to fastrack ovens, Ray's will be my go-to place from here on out.

Great little diner. I got the Hiboy Burger with sweet potato fries and it was amazing. They use a good quality beef that doesn't shrink down a lot after they cook it. Sweet potato fries were nice and crispy.

As a Constitutionalist, I believe in private property rights. A business has the right to control the conversation in their restaurants. Just like any of us have the right to do so in our own homes. Anyone has the right to remove someone from their private property for any reason. You do not pay the rent payment every month, don't tell them what to do with their property.   This storm will blow over K O'Donnell's... stay strong! No one will remember this in a couple of weeks.

I really wanted to like this place knowing the owner is a world champion of bbq but obviously he isn't involved with managing the restaurant. The brisket was garbage, the corn bread was equivalent to a scotchpad and the beans were just ok. Their mac n cheese is kraft...??? Can't a bbq restaurant make their own? I thought they usually do.  I did like the sauce.   I may give them another chance and then edit this review after that but it may be awhile until I work up the courage to eat there again.  A day after eating here, I nicknamed this place "Thee Pots" because that's where you will spend part of your day after eating here.

Great company of integrity. I would definitely buy another from them. They don't always have fancy cars on the lot but sometimes they get some really nice cars. I got a beautiful Acura that was only a few years old for $2500 under blue book. Whatever your budget is they will sell you a car that will run good for awhile for a fair price.   Buy from them!

Heard about this place from Barry Young on KFYI and I am so glad they are a sponsor of the show. Awesome burgers made to order with fresh toppings. They were good and greasy. The fries are amazing as well.   A+!

I usually don't like ripping on places too often but people are WAY too high on this place. ITS  A DUMP! It's full of bratty screaming kids, dirty-nasty-stained-clothing and shoes and there's always a need for police there. I could see if it actually sold desirable clothing there but I wouldn't even call it last years fashions. Most of the stuff there was never "in style." It smells like a sewer in there as well. I would rather pay full retail for something then to ever step foot in this dump.

My family and I have been coming to Chinos for close to 15 years now and it seems to me that ever since it was featured on DDD that prices have gone up and portions have gone down.   I usually pass on the rice and ask for a double order of beans. This passed visit, my wife ordered a small side of beans with her quesadilla. They put my double order of beans in a big styrofoam container and only filled it up to the small beans container level. I compared the two and realized I got duped. Jade red chicken is still delicious but the portions look like more of a kids meal. My machaca burrito looked like something from Taco Bells value meal.   Foods good but that value isn't there anymore. We as a family are probably going to find a new tradition to eat at. It's always sad to see a place my family has been eating for this long to go this far downhill.

I am going to make this review short and sweet..  Great food! I love the hashbrowns! I am big fan of the food!  The negative end of this place... the wait. Its a great place to take out of town guests or an occasional place to drop into every now and then. I don't think any place is worth waiting 45 minutes in the heat.

Food is unique and tasty. I got the grilled burrito with pork and let me tell you, I was extremely impressed by the succulence of the pork and the big array of flavour in my food. It's definitely not Mexican but a melting pot of all the different Latin countries. I was not much of a pork fan until I ate here with my wife. She got the chili verde enchiladas, those were spectacular!  Will definitely be going back!

I have frequented often and enjoyed eating here until yesterday, when my wife and I stopped in for a late lunch. I ordered a combo that had an enchilada with it and my wife ordered the cheese enchiladas. Instead of getting enchiladas, we received a table spoon (if that) of cold cheese wrapped up in a tortilla with drenched in red sauce. I brought the food back up and their response was, 'we ran out.' So if you are out of something, let the customers know. Don't just half-heartedly attempt to mimic the entree someone ordered. That's dishonest and a rip-off.   We won't be back.

Best fish and chips in town by far. They have many other English/Scottish/Irish food options as well. Their beer selection is by far the best in Phoenix. Service is always good. If you don't like greasy food, don't order fried food, derr!

Food was alright but I thought it was a bit overpriced for fast food Mexican that's really nothing special or unique. Me and my wife went there and it was over $20 and I was just barely full. It's a better value to just go to a local sit down Mexican restaurant or hit up another taco shop. In one word how would I describe? "Overrated"  Can't believe I've read some reviews saying you get a lot of food for the money. Where do some of you eat where you walk away barely full and have spent over $20 on so so fast food and call it "cheap" and "large portions"?

I just came in here to eat for my sister's birthday and I thought it was pretty tasty. We ordered 2 appetizers, nachos with chicken and fried pickles. I loved the nachos but fried pickles aren't my thing really. I ordered the junkie burger and that definitely ruled. Egg on a burger with bacon, couldn't pass it up. It was delicious! We all split the giant banana split between the 8 of us and there was plenty leftover. I definitely recommend checking this place out.

We received an online offer from them for a $19.99 single photo offer online. We were looking at getting a family photo done for Christmas so we figured this would make it easier than trying to find a photographer and a place to take a picture. We made our appointment and told them what we were coming in for.   Oh boy.. They made us take a lot of different poses and different combinations. This is all part of the sales pitch at the end. They make sure things are as uncomfortable and noisy as possible when it comes to choosing your pictures and package. We explained that we were just there for the online promo to get a Christmas card picture and the photographer told us "we don't do that, we are too busy. You have to spend $400 to get that promo." The coupon doesn't mention a minimum purchase. We specifically told them when we made the appointment what are intentions were. It was nerve-wracking have 30 people standing behind us with screaming kids. How is anyone supposed to make a decision with that kind of atmosphere? I just wanted to get out of there. Magically, they honored the promo but "this time only." Trust me, that will be the only time we go there.   Save yourself the headache and go to either one of the department stores that do pictures. You'll spend less when it's all said and done.

Went for the carne fest and it was probably the worst experience I have ever had for the $45 I paid for dinner. The waitress couldn't remember to bring me my drink, the food was either under or over-cooked, service lacked professionalism and they ran out of nearly everything.   I will never go here again.

I just bought a place in the area and found a coupon for Lush Burger in my mailbox. So I decided to give them a try. I am very glad I did.  I walked in and was quickly greeted by a waitress not working at the bar. I told her I just wanted to place a to go order and she pointed to the bar. I walked up to the bar and was promptly greeted. I had to take a minute to look at the menu to decide what I wanted. I decided to go with the Infusion Burger and an order of sweet potato fries. "WOW" is all I can say about that burger. Perfectly cooked. It was super juicy and was full of flavor. I enjoyed all the toppings on it. It gave it a great taste without over-powering the flavor of the beef. The sweet potato fries were good.   The only negative that I could say is that the bartender seemed either extremely stressed out or a bit on the cold side. But nonetheless, I don't judge on little things like that on a first visit. We all have bad days.  I HIGHLY recommend people to check this place out. Since it is literally walking distance from my house, I think I will be dropping in time to time for happy hour.

This location needs a lot of help. My dad and I sat at our table for close to 20 minutes before we even spoke to anyone. If they were busy, I would understand but they were close to dead. We ordered our food and coffee at the same time and when they brought us our coffee, the container was almost empty and the coffee was watered down. We informed our server of it and he said he would bring us more. Well, food came out, we ate it all and still no coffee. Then they had the nerve to try to charge us for it. The food was terrible. Hash browns were raw. Won't be back because this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience at this location. Prices keep going up, quality keeps going down.

Great prices. My daughter and I ate there for $12 and walked out stuffed. It's definitely not authentic Mexican but it is still good. I got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco. Both were fantastic for the money. The only knock on the place I have is that it was 90* in the dining room so I just took my food to go.

Great place to go if you want to waste 2 hours of your day off. They'll promise the world over the phone and then not even live up to half of what they promised. They try to sell used trucks with 5000 miles and obvious signs of wear on them as 'New'.

Stopped in while on my way to a job site for the $5 lunch special. I was thinking it was going to be a light lunch (which I prefer) but I was surprised. It was a feast and I ate it all of course. The sauce is amazing and the fries are awesome. I definitely recommend Porkopolis for any meal! Service was prompt and friendly.  You guys put me into a food coma!

Stopped in yesterday looking for another pistol and they have a good selection of older pistols (my preference) and a wide variety of ammo of different calibers. Looking for a specialty caliber, they'll have it. They are friendly and knowledgable.   Will gladly return.

I have taken Sunrise Cab Co a few times now and so far I have had nothing but good experiences except for one time. The cabbies are necessarily the most friendly always but its a cheap ride with no surprise charges. The cars are older but it''s cheap ride home.   My average fare from Discount is $9 home from my favourite watering hole, My average with Sunrise is around $5
