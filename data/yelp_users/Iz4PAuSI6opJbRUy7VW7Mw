DISAPPOINTMENT NAMED SALAD.  I've been going to Houston's for 23 years (I started young) and I've been getting the same dish EVERY single time.  Why?  Because it's great EVERY single time.  Never have to worry.  Except this time.  I usually split the salad with someone along with the artichoke dip.  Dip = great.  Salad = Worst.  When did we change it up and add corn?   And the portion was the size of a side salad.  Side salad?  Really?  Are we that pretentious Hillstone?  And never mind about mentioning the difference of proportion to your waiter.  It doesn't go anywhere.  Which was another first.    All in all, a Debbie Downer of a meal at the sorta new Houstons.

Well...   My mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right?   So mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.)   The great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there.   But really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy.   Just not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad...

Like the previous reviewer, I would give zero stars if I could.   We contracted my home warranty regarding our heat not working. They in turn sent out a request for Tatem Air to fix the issue.   Normally, I would be understanding of a delay if we didn't have a newborn. I called to ask if there's any way they could give me an estimate on time as I wanted to leave the house since it was so cold in here for the baby. NO RESPONSE. Called 5 hours later...no response from Tatem.   Now we have to wait till the next day for another company to come on a Saturday when we could have contacted another company. It will be a cold night cuddling our little one.   Thank you for not contacting us back when you're needed and wasting our time.

Their meatballs are simply the best meatballs I have ever had.  I highly recommend them as the flavor and the texture are out of this world fantastic.  And don't even get me started on the wonderful service.  Outstanding!  Two Thumbs up!

Good coffee, GREAT service.  Every time I come around in my old beat up car that hasn't been washed in a year making all the noise so that I can't hear a word on the speaker, they STILL treat me like I'm an old friend and it's a pleasure to see every time.    How can you say no to that?!?

I will not ever be trying to rent a car here again.  Notes to instate car renters:  1.  They will not accept your driver's license unless it has the most current address printed out on your license.  PROBLEM:  By law, you are required to notify the MVD of a move within 10 days.  They do NOT send you another license with the new address.  You can order one, however, there is a fee for it.  And why bother when it's not the address that links you back, it's the DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER.    2.  They will also require a hard copy of a utility bill.  They will not accept anything else, no electronic copy, but a hard copy.  WTF?  3.  Have your most current insurance card on you before you rent.  My mistake for leaving it in my car at home and having the previous quarter's proof in my wallet.  They would not allow me to have one emailed directly to them.  Nor would they let me print one out for proof.    4.  They put a block on your credit card or debit card for $350 and takes up to 14 days before they will release it.  When I asked what were my options as I was limited on time and did not have means of transportation to get the proof they required (which I have never been asked for at other car rentals), they said I didn't have any.  I would need to go somewhere else.    FYI - I also mentioned to the CSRs behind the counter to read the reviews on Yelp as some of them are specifically mentioned by name.  Guess what?  What those others wrote about them?  SO TRUE!!!!

I ordered a caramel apple pie after MUCH deliberation and help from Traci...and OH MY GOD. Delicious!! We took her suggestion and warmed up our slice just a bit. Wow!! Every bite was heaven!   I highly recommend ordering your next pie from Pie Snob. I know I am a fan for life. :o)

I wasn't all that impressed with the customer service or the current stock.   I was disappointed to see they were only selling a few wallflower bulbs and only the singles. Their products consist mostly of personal care (lotions, bath items) at this location.   I also was not able to locate my coupon and had trouble connecting to the internet to see if there was a coupon code via an email. A store clerk stood there for a few minutes knowing what I was desperately doing and did nothing to help me. She just stood there staring at me. No offer to help. Just stared.   Needless to say, after minutes go by of staring and myself not connecting to the net, I was uncomfortable and left without buying a single item.

I'm definitely giving a 5 star review due to the service.   We had our 1 cheat day and I was dead set on a greasy burger. So, we decided to try The Stand and get drive thru.   However, when we got home, the bag broke open, spilling all of the food on the concrete parking spot. We were so bummed! I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Ron. This is where I'm floored.   Ron drove all the way to where we live just to deliver a new set of burgers!! Are you kidding?!? That is AMAZING customer service and REALLY going above and beyond!!!!  Thank you so much for turning our night around!!   Oh! And you really have to try these shakes. Wow.
