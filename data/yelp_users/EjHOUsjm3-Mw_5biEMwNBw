I came here a few days ago, I ordered a footlong and a medium drink, i sat and ate there, when I went to refill my drink, manager tells me "you cant just walk in and refill, i have to charge you for that!" I told him yeah but i have already paid for it awhyl ago, he stares at me and ignores and goes at the back, Manager is rude ! Worst subway ever! Never expected that!
