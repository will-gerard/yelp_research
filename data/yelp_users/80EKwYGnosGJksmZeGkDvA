Been buying my boots here for years. Never a problem this time slight hiccup on a re - sole . The guy stepped up an took careof it without even being asked made me hell of a deal. This is what I call excellent customer service.

Excellent roast beef, the Big max is the best. I asked for extra horsey sauce didn't get but 3. Then I realized the roast beef is delicious doesn't need none of of that. Fast drive thru even during high traffic times at noon

I guess I should have looked at the reviews before I decide to eat a hot dog. Cold ,soggy, nasty not even sure it was edible. I was in a hurry and had to go fast, never again!

Convenient  Home  Services is my AC/Heating Company of choice.  Customer service is excellent and the technicians they sent out are very knowledgeable and answered all my questions.   I would highly recommend them to family and friends.

On Sunday September 30th my daughter baptized her child and we decided to host the baptism  dinner at Stone and Vine restaurant in Chandler.  It was a party of 30 and the gal  Amanda did an awesome job accommodating us with a meal that was delicious, filling and work within my budget.  Service was awesome everyone had a great time and comment on how delicious the food was.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely will be back.
