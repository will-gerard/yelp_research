Italian food is one of my favorites, I'm always excited to try different pasta's and "authentic" Italian cooking. I had been wanting to try this place but never really felt the need to go out of my way to make it happen. Needless to say I was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged.    Presentation C: They are renovating right now, there were no signs coming into the parking lot indicating the entrance. We (of course) attempted to enter through the main entrance, only to be stop by a small piece of paper that said the entrance was the other end of the building. Ugh. Who likes to walk on gravel in 4'' heels?   The overall feel of the restaurant is very warm, the furniture and decor is all antique, resembles broken down shipping crates, antique lighting, but  still very well lit. Our group sat in a group dinning area behind the hostess stand so we got to see everyone that walked in, which was a little distracting. People were standing by our entrance waiting for their table, poor design.    Staff D+:  Hostess did not greet upon walking into the restuarant, after arriving to her stand we saw our group seated directly behind her and we sat ourselves.  Our group had been seated for 15 minutes prior to our arrival, granted we were still waiting for others, 15 minutes in and no one at the table had drinks. Really? The waiter wasn't very friendly, his service was very poor. He would disappear for 10-15 between each action. Drink order.... 15 minutes till drink delivery. Drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes. He finally returns to take our food order food takes 20 minutes... we eat. We're done. He doesn't check on us at all during the process... 10 minutes after we are done eating he returns to take our ice cream order.... I think you get the point. I'm sure you're probably asking yourself,.... were they busy? No. At least it didn't look busy to me.  Food C-: This part will be short and sweet. The food is mediocre at best, I can make it at home. I got the Chicken Parmigiana with Fettuccine Alfredo. The portion of food in comparison to the price, is small. It is not a lot of food at all.The taste was very bland for Italian I found myself adding salt.   Best thing about the restaurant is the building and decor,i'm curious about the renovations. The staff needs to be more friendly and welcoming and they need to deliver a better experience for the customer. The food portions need to be increased by 20%. I've never eaten Italian food and not had to have a to go box. Especially for the price we paid.  I would only return if I was invited and accompanied by a group and everyone else wanted it.

Today I can only review the customer service experience. This is my first time using this store and I didn't know what I was going in for or even what to expect.  The gentleman that helped me was very kind. He explained product and let me decide what I needed based on that information.  I need to treat my outside and inside for scorpions and black widows. He made sure I had all the tools I would need to get the job done and gave me a demonstration on how to properly apply my new products.  I'm very excited to see how well the products works and how much I will save.   The products and tools I purchased were around 150 bucks total. Pest control companies are about 50 bucks every two months. Hopefully I save in the long run! With fewer bugs and pests.  Wish me luck.

Ugh. It's ok. Asi Asi. I left planet fitness and came here because they have classes and a child care center. This is gonna be a long one.   I guess my not so over the top experience with this club started because I enrolled over the phone. Completely my fault.   Issue 1: Staff is not readily available. My first day, I was lost and confused. I tried to get a tour everyone was busy enrolling people. Ugh. I didn't even know where the locker room was. I'm not a ding dong totally. I found it eventually.  Issue 2: They hawk you for personal training. Like you're a fat little mouse that's dying to be eaten.  Finally I get someone to give me some attention day 2 and I ask for my tour. He's a younger guy I can tell he is there to sell memberships.   So I tell this guy, "I want a tour of the gym, I need to know specifically where certain equipment is so I'm not wondering around while I'm working out." I swear, all this kid heard was "whamp whamp whamp I'm new whamp I never had a fitness test whamp I want to dump all my money into a personal trainer whamp whamp"  He proceeds to tell me in order to get a tour, I need to schedule an appointment with a fitness trainer and get a fitness assessment. I tell him "I DO NO WANT A FITNESS ASSESSMENT, I AM NOT READY FOR THAT, I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE EQUIPMENT IS" Again he hears  "whamp whamp whamp I'm new whamp I never had a fitness test whamp I want to dump all my money into a personal trainer whamp whamp"  So finally like forget it, I will schedule an appointment if that means I get a tour. So he walks me over to Andre who is very nice and not pushy and proceeds to tell Andre that I'm interested in getting a fitness assessment.  I said HOLD UP. "All I want is a tour. That's it." Andre took the lead and said she just wants a tour and the kid is like " I thought you wanted your fitness assessed" like wtf.   He didn't listen at all. Is the point.  Issue 3: Doesn't seem very clean. This During my first week, I went for 5 days. Never did I see one employee wiping down equipment, I didn't even see available disinfectant to wipe it down myself. Like gross. At planet fitness they were always wiping down the equipment.  The Zumba and Yoga classes are great! I had a lot of fun with Leo. This gym can get pretty busy so beware.  They have some room for improvement and if PF ever offers childcare I will be back there in a heartbeat.

Mmmmmm. My my my... Best Curry in town!  This is a diamond in the rough. You don't know how good it really is, until you put the fork in your mouth. I've passed by this place for years! Because of the area and the name, I never thought twice about giving it a try.  Thanks to a good friend, you know who you are. I've found my go to place when I'm tired of Chipotle, which is my liiiife.   When you come in the decor is contemporary (newly renovated) upscale with a nice balance of cultural decor as well. It's a small dining area so it's not good for large groups.  I've tried a few dishes here and they have all been great, the Panang Curry, the Green Curry, the Yellow Curry, The Pad Se-ew, The Drunken Noodle, and the Orange Chicken.   The vegetables are crisp and fresh, the noodles aren't overly greasy like I've found at other Thai restaurants, very light grease. The flavors marriage together perfectly, I mean I'm hooked.  The staff is good, there is one lady there that isn't very consistent. She never checks on the table or refills water, she doesn't smile much, she does't bring the credit card when you're done without asking for it. The place can do without her to be honest.   However the owner is nice and the older lady her name starts with a T is super nice as well.  Great place for lunch and dinner.

Oh my goodness... I love this store. I'm here at least 3 times a week. Compared to the other grocery stores in the area, Fry's, Wal-Mart, Safeway, etc... hands down their produce and chicken are the best.  For all you naysayers, that don't believe you can eat healthy on a budget I dare you to try sprouts! I can spend $20 on fresh produce and chicken and feed four people for at least 2 days.  Their processed foods, i.e. frozen food and packaged dry food, tends to be a little more expensive then other places. However, in return you are receiving "healthier" processed food?  The staff is always friendly. I've even had them go out of their way to explain the proper way to cook produce I was not familiar with.  I haven't figured out of to use the tips on Yelp yet, Sprouts has great in house stuffed sausages! Chicken options and pork for all you miss piggy eaters :)   This is my neighborhood sprouts and I haven't had a need to shop at any other one so I can't compare them to another Sprouts, however this is in comparison to other grocery stores in the area.
