If you need to get locks rekeyed that weren't purchased here don't go to this location, only the Home Depot on Crismon and Southern still does that. The hardware associate went so far as to tell me it was "unlawful" for them to do so..

I hate this place and I don't like to use the word "hate". It's a crime what they charge for pizza in comparison to what you get, it's awful and they should be ashamed to serve it. Many of the games were not working, the place was disgustingly dirty and the staff all seemed like they hated the place as much as I do. Whenever one of my kids gets invited to a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese's I cringe, I'd rather shoot myself in the foot with a .22 than go back to this rip-off...

Food wasn't fresh, service was terrible, everything was dirty and gross. This place is worse every time we come in, used to love coming in here. $24 for salads and water is pretty steep too, I think we're done here.

I've been in here two or three different times for different reasons and have always been very happy with the service I receive. Very nice storage units, nice people, great prices on hitches too!

Who would ever expect to write a 5 star review about a Water and Ice store? I sure didn't but WOW, these people were fantastic! It was actually awkward to get such great service, didn't know how to handle it to be honest. These folks earned a customer for life tonight, offered to rinse my water containers, helped fill and load without me asking, best trip to get water ever!

We have been coming to this store for 3 or 4 years now for groceries but have added a new twist recently, at least for us. They have really good pizza, chicken, mashed potatoes, etc. and it's priced pretty well (not the Mac & Cheese, it's WAY overpriced) so it's been like having a new place to grab some dinner when we don't want to cook and a much better option than fast food! Great customer service also, they always go out of their way to make sure everything is just right!

Service was crap, manager guy was kind of an asshole, food was expensive and quality was low.

I've been literally ordered by many people to try this place for lunch, so I finally did. Short and sweet, I've made up a new word to describe Firehouse Subs, phenomenaltastic. Best sub I've had in.. well, ever.

4 out of every 5 times we come here it's phenomenal, once in a while they're off their game and the food is no bueno but it's rare.

What a disappointing dinner, waited all week to go out with the family and the kids wanted to come here. I ordered a burger with curly fries, came out with regular fries instead. My sons French toast came out without bananas. Other sons spaghetti came out without meatballs, wife's fries were severely undercooked. Asked for these things to be fixed and by the time they were our food was gone. I let our server Tyler know we were unhappy and the response was "sorry, here's your bill." Walked up to pay, told him I was unhappy again and offered a lame 15% off. Bad service, poor quality food and an unhappy ex-customer.

Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...

Had a quick lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by how good the cantina fish taco's were, they were tiny (which is how I like to eat) and full of flavor. Good service and nice atmosphere. Will definitely be returning for lunch more often.

Phenomenal gelato! We love to come here every couple of weeks, even got a birthday cake thing that was amazing and they're family owned which we always try to support first!

I don't think I could have been more unsatisfied with my experience today at Banfield Pet Hospital. I was watching my parents 10 month old boxer over the weekend and this morning around 5am she was running around in the back yard and somehow broke her leg. It was a pretty bad break and she was in a tremendous amount of pain. We called Banfield because they're very close to us and have seen our dog in the past. When I explained that it is not my dog and my parents could not be reached as they are out of cell phone range they advised they were not willing to offer any help until a payment method was offered. I asked if they would take a post-dated check for two days and they said no way. They had absolutely zero compassion to the situation. My mother ended up calling in the payment and the girl forgot to take her expiration date. When we showed up to get the dog she wasted no time to threaten to take US to collections if the issue didn't get resolved by tomorrow! We quickly let her know where to go and how to get there. That is her problem, not ours! When we left I asked for a printout of the X-ray and they advised it would be $25. This place is only interested in your money, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

Great place to go if you want to deal with a complete bitch of a doctor who has absolutely no patience for questions and talks to you like you're an idiot for asking. Otherwise fine I suppose.

This is the best coffee shop in the east valley, hands down. We come in every Sunday for breakfast and love the food, the atmosphere and the people. You have to check it out and support local businesses! Forget Starbucks, they're the Walmart of coffee...

I love this place, the employees make this location better than any other location in the area. They also allow me to double the meat and then split a burrito into two which is absolutely perfect.

Amazing price on organic bulk coffee, low priced steak and they treat their employees really well from what I hear. I hope this place gives Walmart a run for their money!

This was our first time here and we loved it! Great service, prices were good, food was phenomenal. Couldn't ask for anything better, only concern is that the entire restaurant is booths so I don't see how I could bring in a large party..

Came in for dinner last night, haven't been in for a few months and Diane remembered my name and where I was sitting the last time we came in. Got to meet her husband Albert as well, they are the owners, super impressed by these people and their outlook on their business, their community and their product. Great people and great food, couldn't recommend them highly enough!

Dear God in Heaven, there is a burrito here called "The Beast" that is, hands down, the best burrito I've ever eaten. I'm not kidding, WOW! Also, the quesadilla with chicken was pretty much the second greatest thing I've ever eaten. A little pricey? Sure.. Worth it? I'd say so.

Holy crap, these are really good donuts and very nice people! It was cool to meet Jade, turns out her family owns a few donut shops in the area that my wife grew up. You can't beat a dozen donut holes for 99c either!

I love this place, the atmosphere is wonderful and relaxing, the floatation therapy helps me wind down and get ready for a new week (I float on Sunday nights). Floating is a little awkward at first but once you figure it out it's very relaxing and like meditation on steroids. They just added an oxygen bar too for after your float, pretty awesome, couldn't recommend this place highly enough.
