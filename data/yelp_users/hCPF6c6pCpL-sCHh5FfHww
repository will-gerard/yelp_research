The entire staff is extremely compassionate and  understanding. There is no judgement. Dr. Yunis is a visionary. He is so real and straight forward which I found to be very comforting. You are in good hands here. This isn't just an office filled with doctors that perform abortions, the doctors themselves deliver babies too.

Giant Burger's food is fantastic. The hamburgers are made with 100% beef and taste homemade. Their garden burger is made with a Boca patty that is grilled to heavenly perfection (you must try it with mushrooms yum!). Whichever burger you choose, it will be freaking huge. Their fries are cooked in canola oil and they are just the right amount of crispy. I had a chocolate shake which was big enough to share but I wouldn't dare share something so amazing. The only thing that bothered me was the hamburger buns. It's like they were steamed. After the bun touches a wet tomato and onion the bread becomes kind of soggy but still edible and delicious. I prefer a grilled bun so I will ask for a grilled bun the next time. Also their shakes are not very thick. However, the shakes do have an exquisite taste and the amount that you get for the price is awesome. Everything is reasonably priced! I'll be back for sure!

The food was average, it is nothing to write about. The waffles were decent but thin and soft and almost soggy. The service was very good, April was a great server. The prices are within reason, however other diners have the same prices but you get more for your money. This place has a very "middle of nowhere, backwoods, country greasy spoon" atmosphere. I felt comfortable but that might not be for everyone. The seating is minimal so I would not bring more than a total of 4 people or you'll be packed like a can of sardines. I had a good first experience here and I'd come back.

Awesome mall. A little on the ghetto side but we'll just call it "culture." This mall has everything.  Just don't come on the weekends, it is so crowded and it will frustrate even the most patient person.

I've always avoided this place because of it's apparent stereotypical cultural views of African Americans and soul food in general. After I've sat and ate here I can assure you that this place is anything but a stereotype. That playdoh that they are trying to pass off as baked macaroni and cheese is disgraceful.

So I ordered 24 honey bbq wings from this place. I was told by Heidi that the wait was going to be 45 minutes to an hour for delivery, which was fine so I ordered. After I got off the phone my husband says to me "That wait time is way too long for a Tuesday afternoon, I'm starving lets just get Dominos', their wait time is 20-30 minutes." So I agree with my husband and I called Barro's promptly to cancel my order. Heidi answers and says ok we will cancel the order for the wings. My order was placed at 3:56pm. I cancelled my order at 4:02pm. At 4:09 a delivery guy knocks at my door with 24 wings. I paid for the wings  because they came super fast and it saved me from having to leave the house so it was a win win. Here's my beef with Barro's: my wings came without honey bbq sauce. The plus side is that I was offered new wings free of charge. I feel like the cooks rushed my order, and when I tried to cancel they tried to force these half ass wings on me. To send me wings without any sauce whatsoever is just ridiculous. Especially when my receipt reads "24 Boneless Honey BBQ." Mistakes happen, but this was no mistake. Barro's started making the wings and didn't want to waste them. But if the wings only took 13 minutes to cook and deliver why was I told it would be a 45 minute wait? The good news is that now you guys know that you can order from this place then cancel and they will speed up your delivery time... Get it together Barro's!

I came into this place while it was full and I was seated right after I picked my color! I treated my husband to his first spa pedicure with callus removal and he said his toes were very relaxed, lol. I love my pedicure, purple is so hot right now. They took their time and they were very nice ladies (not that fake kind of "nice" nail lady like at other nail salons.) This is a family friendly nail salon. The ladies that work here will ask about your kids and how your holiday was and they are being genuine. Overall I can say that for my first visit I have had a splendid experience. I would recommend them and I will most likely return within the next couple of weeks!

I will make a long story short, I ordered the build your own burger. I asked for a beef patty and the patty was literally falling apart. It was more like a ground beef nugget burger. Shake my head! I guess they thought that slapping some cheese on top would help keep all the pieces together...FAIL. From now on, I'll be making a drive all the way down to Stapley and Baseline for a les sub par Denny's experience.

This review is long overdue.  It's unfortunate that bad things happen to good people. I moved here in July 2015. In August my AC unit caught fire due to poor wiring. I called the fire department who advised me to stay somewhere else for the next 2 days due to all the smoke that was inside the apartment. When I notified Rosie the manager in the leasing office she was argumentative and stated that my AC unit had not caught on fire. After explaining to her that the fire department was dispatched and actually put out the fire, she replaced the entire unit. The handymen left holes in my ceiling exposing pipes and wiring. There was blue dye all over my walls.  Two days ago the bathroom mirror fell off the wall and shattered onto the floor. This was due to corrosion around the bolts that hold the mirror. When I showed Rosie the pictures of all the broken glass on my floor and the rusted bolts, she tells me that these apartments are over 30 years old. She can't help me.   This apartment is clearly a death trap. They aren't even willing to move me to another unit. I'm still waiting for a new mirror. I asked if Rosie if she could atleast have the apartment inspected. She actually came to my apartment with a low cut shirt, bearing massive amounts of cleavage, in 5 inch high heels. She almost twisted her ankle and fell in the rocks on the way out. Rosie manages her appearance, not these apartments.  My lease is almost up. I don't think I can stay another day to be honest.

I'm not sure why Falcon Glen Apartments or Rosie would advise me to contact them to "further discuss any issues." I have already contacted Rosie and just as other reviewers have already stated: SHE IS RUDE EVERYTIME YOU CONTACT HER!! Despite all of my failing appliances and the moldy smell coming from the vents! Falcon Glen and Rosie have made it very clear that although my unit is unsafe, I am bond by the rental agreement. If I would like a safer unit with less problems I will have to fork over a $200 transfer fee. I can also wait until the end of my lease in 2 months and be transferred to another unit for free. Their units are UNSAFE. Rosie even told me that the units are unsafe because they are over 30 years old with no plans to be rejuvenated.  Jesus, Myrna Rosie and Veronica are all very happy to take your rent money but attitudes start flying when you make a simple maintenance request. I can not stress this enough, do not move to Falcon Glen Apartments.

This Wendy's is a joke. Tonya the so called manager is very unprofessional and rude. When you go thru the drive thru at any restuarant there is a possibility that you might receive the wrong order. No big deal right? Just go back and let them know so they can give you the right order. When I went back to let Tonya know that I must have innocently received the wrong order, she proceeds to scream at me. I told her that mistakes are possible and that no one is perfect. She argues with me for close to 5 minutes and then eventually gives in and remakes my order. She then tells me that I am taking time away from helping other customers. Well newsflash, if I received the correct order in the first place I'd have no reason to come back. After she replaced my order she refused to return my receipt to me. The receipt has valuable information about contacting the General Manager and District Manager with any complaints. She didn't want to give me my receipt back because she feared that I would inform her superiors about how she is treating their valuable loyal customers. I had to snatch the receipt from her hands. This upset her so she then proceeds to write my license plate number down as if I had done something wrong. Regardless to whether this order was remade or not, the receipt is still my property. I paid for a good/service and I am entitled to a receipt under Arizona state law. I will be contacting Wendy's corporate office and the franchise owner directly in writing. To be treated this way by a drive thru employee is unacceptable. To be treated this way by a Wendy's employee is despicable. I have never had a problem at any Wendy's location. This experience has absolutely blown my mind. I will not continue to support the Wendy's mission. There are loads of restaurants in the area. I choose Wendy's because it is usually a very pleasant experience.

This location is much better than the mesa location! The salsa is very fresh and the bean dip hasn't been watered down with water in a pathetic attempt to stretch it. The food was hot and fresh, unlike the mesa location. I ordered the red Chile Colorado and my husband ordered the ultimate nachos. Both dishes were plentiful and delicious! My parents both ordered burritos and enchiladas which they raved about. Customer service at this location is superior compared to the mesa location also. The waiter was polite and seemed generally happy. I will be back again and again. But never will I ever make the mistake of going to the mesa location just because it's closer to home.

I'd never been to physical therapy before I came to San Tan Physical Therapy. I have horrible back pain. I had no idea what to expect. Joal was extremely compassionate and professional. I left the office feeling 50% better which was a major improvement since it was only my first visit. He sent me home with a diagram of some strengthening exercises that I can do at home. I absolutely love this place and I am so glad that they accept my insurance. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. I highly recommend them!

The thing about Serrano's is that you have to know what to order. The food is a hit and miss. Some of it is really good and some of it isn't. Their bean dip is amazing as well as their chunky house made salsa. The fajitas are weird, don't order them. The burritos and the chimichangas are the best things on the menu. Their sour cream is seasoned and it tastes kinda strange to be honest. But on the plus side their fried ice cream is to die for! Also they have some pretty damn decent cocktails and their happy hour prices are affordable. It is right next to my doctor's office so I will be back.

Wow someone should terminate "Dee." I saw her stealing money from the bottom of a self check register and putting it in her pocket. I know she was in fact stealing because she glanced over both shoulders suspiciously before putting the cash in her pocket. This was clearly somebody's change! Janet wears a red customer service vest but refuses to provide acceptable customer service and does not engage with customers.This store is always out of stock and their vegetables are rarely fresh. Here's what you need to do, drive to Combs and shop at the Marketplace. The staff there is mature and professional and the produce is of a much higher quality. Poop on this store.

The food is always hot and the drinks are awesome, however the service isn't always the best. Today I waited 6 minutes just for my order to be taken, then another 15 minutes to get my food. That wouldn't be such a big deal on my day off but my lunch break is only 45 minutes. Sometimes the servers are kinda rude but it depends on who you get. Justin is the best server, he is always prompt and polite. He even comes to the window mid-meal to make sure I haven't ran out of napkins or sauce. Overall I would have to say that this is one of the best Sonic Drive-In's in the Gilbert area.

1.) For more than $20 a plate I should be able to sit at my own chefs table even though I have less than 8 people in my party.   2.) If you are going to make fried rice for 8 people there should be more than a half piece of chicken breast in it.   3.) Just because the chef cooks in front of you doesn't mean the food will taste good.  4.) This is not authentic Japanese food. Sarku Japan inside the mall food court has more authentic Japanese food and Fry's Marketplace has more authentic sushi.   5.) The hibachi chicken rice is not worth the extra $3.50. Save that money for when you leave and you're still hungry.   6.) If you cook vegetables before meat then the vegetables will be cold by the time the meat is done cooking. This is common knowledge.  7.) Food is mediocre at best and I don't like being over charged for mediocre.

I didn't eat here. I just went to the country store to buy a rocking chair but the girls in the shop were really helpful! The store smells like the holidays during this time of year. They have a huge selection of candles! I thought everything in the store was reasonably priced for a gift shop. You can find some pretty neat stuff in here. I will definitely be back to get Christmas decorations and candles.

You could order just about anything and be satisfied. Gyro meat is 80% lamb and 20% beef. Falafels are to die for. Hummus is off the chain. Tzatziki sauce is always fresh. And the Baklava?? I'm almost positive that there is crack in the Baklava because it is totally addicting. My only complaint is that they serve way too much food and I leave there feeling like I am going to explode. But I guess that isn't really a complaint now is it?

So I ordered a burrito from this "establishment" and there was plastic wrap cooked INSIDE my food. Luckily it wasn't melted in my food so I just pulled it out. When I notified the DISTRICT MANAGER who happened to be on duty at that time she was peeved that I told her I wasn't going to let her remake my food because obviously their staff does not follow the proper food handling procedures otherwise this little mishap never would have happened. She then grabbed her other manager ERIC and they proceeded to attack me and ask me not to return to Garcia's. This  is completely backwards. Dude, you guys cooked plastic wrap into my food and you're mad at me? Brian the server is horrible and talks to customers unprofessionally. I will not be back to this location. I recommend that you take your business to a cleaner establishment.

Dude seriously? I got a pretty damn decent glass of cabernet sauvignon for $3.95 and my husband got a 16oz beer for  $1.99. Insane!! The BBQ wings we ordered were hot, fresh and delicious! (No pun intended.)  I'm on my second glass of wine now, and at this price I could sit here all night long. My server Kristen was awesome she gave the best customer service, ask for her when you get there! The most pleasant dining experience I have had in ages. Kudos Rosati's!

I just brought an iPad mini for my unborn child. Don't judge me. I know, I'm a crazy person. Rory was very knowledgeable! She helped me choose between the iPad mini's with and without retina display. She even helped me pick out a native union gripster case and stand combo! My husband and I just love this iPad mini for our daughter and Rory even helped us pick out some educational apps and interactive books for her. I will be back in a few weeks to buy an iMac from her!

I bought  8 packs of jumbo RastAfri hair and it was a pretty reasonable price at $2.99 each. I also got a comb and some mascara for really cheap! The store is really clean and very well organized. They have a ton of options to choose from extensions, wigs, and so forth. The owner and her daughter were really helpful. Better than Sally's so I will definitely be back!

Dude seriously read the f#@$?!& reviews! I know i should have! My meal was 39 minutes late. Totaling 1 hour and 46 minutes to arrive. Also my vegetables were hard and undercooked. When I called to complain about my food the lady that originally took my order over the phone (Vee the owner) told me that she also "cooked my food AND delivered it." Girrrl stop lying!  My delivery driver was Hispanic! Shake damn my head. Vee the owner  was extremely rude and blamed that on her lack of English Language skills. Ok fine, as a Hispanic minority I can except that. However, she then said they were too busy and that she could fix it the next time for me. I insisted that she either fix my food TONIGHT or she give me a full refund immediately. I told her that if they were too busy to just give me a refund and she said, "Oh no, lady you don't listen, you just think out your mind, I fix for you." Thinking out of my mind? Ummmmm, well yes, my mind is where I think from? WTF.  She then asked "did you eat it all?" Of course I didn't eat hard vegetables you fool! She said she would fix it within 25 minutes (IT TOOK 40) and that she wants her hard vegetables back. Which is fine by me because I do not eat half @$$ cooked vegetables. The delivery driver was argumentative and claimed that she didn't want to argue but "my food was just fine, because she'd order it plenty of times." It is safe to to say that I will never order from Papaya Thai again. Also the fact that the owner stressed the importance of  receiving said hard veggies back makes me wonder if they redistribute them to other customers. Unacceptable service and food. FAIL!!!!

Let's be realistic. Anytime you go to an establishment that is ran by teenagers and you don't receive attitude, it's a win. The pizza is always the same, cheap but tolerable. I would recommend buying a dipping sauce or even a marinara sauce to go along with your pizza because if you don't it is pretty dry.

I really want to like this hospital but the staff makes it impossible for me to do so. As I've stated in previous reviews, this hospital is beautiful, one might even call it breathtaking. However, customer service and bedside manner are severely sub par. I had the pleasure of delivering my first baby at this hospital on 11/09/14. I stayed 2 days. My delivery nurse Melissa was incredible. And Leilani was the most professional, understanding nurse I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. But during my stay a nurse or "tech" named Emilia was rude and even judgmental. She went as far as telling me to get out of bed, stop whining and that I'm not going to have someone with me "24/7" to hear my complaints when I get home. This was less than 48 hours after giving birth for the first time. Sorry I was in pain. Emilia shouldn't be allowed to deal with patients that are in pain and battling baby blues and possible PPD. Also, I was there for 2 days and the nurses switched shifts about every 12 hours but my linens and trash were both changed only once. I actually started disinfecting my own room. That's a shame. Every time I come here, it just gets worse in the customer service area.

Their office is so cute and really clean. They have tons of magazines for you to read while you wait and a ultra comfy couch. The receptionist was the sweetest lady ever and she was very attentive and helpful. Dr. Bird was awesome! He was kind, understanding and non-judgmental. I was in and out of the office in less than 30 minutes. I visited for appetite suppressants and Dr. Bird decided that Phentermine 37.5 was the best choice for me. He checked my weight, my blood pressure and my heart to determine if I had any underlying problems. After that I got my pills and I was on my way. The total for my office visit and my first 30 day supply of pills was $150.00 (but I got 15% off for liking them on Facebook!) So remember to like them before you go. Also, you can fill out your intake forms online on their website to save time before you get there. I expected for my visit to be awkward and painful but I was pleasantly surprised! The staff was very professional and the price was excellent. I can't waif to type their HCG Diet next!

The service here was pretty bad. The kids working there were unhelpful. The clothes are cheap and so are the shoes. They had a fragrance there that looked like the Gucci bottle but instead of Gucci it was called "Gotcha." But hey, what are you gonna do right? I won't come here again unless I get too drunk at Garcia's, spill bean dip all over my shirt and need a new one.

This place has the smallest collection of happy hour drinks! The bartender (Ciara) was not the greatest but I know she tried her hardest. I didn't get to eat any food because their beer was cloudy and flat which made me think twice about ordering. There was a group of loud obnoxious people when I went and the bartender admitted that this was the norm for this bar. So I won't be returning. 2 stars for the cheapest happy hour draft beer in town.

First off I would just like to say that Safeway is my favorite grocery store. Some say that it is pricey but quality is what matters most in my family. Ok so this Safeway has NO ethnic hair or skin products. However, this is not true for other Safeway's that I have been to (and Walmart's and Fry's for that matter). This is in a pretty diverse area of town! White's, Blacks, Hispanics and Asians alike! This may not matter to most people but when you go to a market you'd expect them to be open to the things you need. Also, the bathrooms are dirty and a cashier named Wanda was just plain crabby. I drove to another Safeway and got my hair pomade as normal. I won't be returning to this store.

This is my favorite circle k. They are much cleaner than the other two in San Tan Valley/Queen Creek. Their sodas also taste better. I know that sounds weird but it's like the carbonation is stronger because they have newer soda machines compared to the older circle k's.

I hope they never get rid of the Yellow Cake Batter yogurt because it is heaven! This establishment is really clean and I love the presentation of their toppings. There are more toppings to choose from at Froyona than at Sweetie Peaz and Yogurt Jungle. I also like that they do the reward program and your 10th yogurt is free! You don't have to use those stupid punch cards either they use your phone number. I am now a die hard loyal pregnant fan of Froyona.

I wish I could have given this place 5 stars because I really wanted to like it. It was my first visit and I was kinda disappointed.   First off this is not a hair braiding SALON. Louise and Anna conduct business inside their townhouse in an empty bedroom. They have two professional salon chairs and a mirror on the wall next to the closet so you can check out your locks.   I got kinky twists (normally $180, but I paid $160 because they had a "coupon" going this week). My hair was alright but it wasn't great. It's nothing to write about!   Louise braided my hair, alone. I was told there would be 2 braiders doing my hair when I made my appointment. (Which is what they advertise on their website. "Two braiders for braids in half the amount of time.") I was told 15 minutes before my appointment via text message that I would only have one braider so I could basically deal with it or reschedule.   They have a small tv in the room which they connect to their iPad; so we watched a couple of Netflix movies which was pretty awesome.  I feel like their prices are pretty damn steep for them to be braiding hair in their home. If I would have known it wasn't a salon and they were charging the same prices i would have reconsidered.   Conclusion: I personally didn't have a great experience, I most likely will not go back.

I've heard awesome things about this place so my husband and I tried it yesterday. First off i'd like to say that Samantha, our cashier was really abrasive and seemed pretty peeved that we didn't know what to order, but hey it was our first time there! We both had one of each taco, (steak and chicken). The steak was really tasty, HOWEVER the chicken was salty. The tacos are about the size of my palm and are $1.80 each. Not a bargain if you ask me. Their salsa is very fresh and tastes amazing, but the guacamole at the salsa bar is just pureed avocado with a lot of water. Beans were great and you get a lot for your money too! Two stars for poor customer service and a pretty good steak taco. Overall I personally wouldn't recommend it.   Peace.

The tacos were freaking amazing! They aren't stingy with the chicken, which I appreciate. My chicken tacos were so fat! I love Mexico, I visit often for the street  tacos (and tequila). There was a guy sitting next to us with a Trump 2016 baseball cap. He ate like 6 tacos and made 2 trips to the salsa bar. Tacos = Unity. The world needs tacos. I would eat here everyday but my husband expects me to cook (yawn). Little does he know we're having this for dinner again, tomorrow!

I hate this post office. I had to call them because I got a blue card in the mail saying "Your parcel was too large to fit in your mailbox, we left it with property management." My property manager said she was there all day and no packages were delivered. That's just peachy. When I called this post office I spoke with Amy who was so unhelpful! She was just like "I will check with the mailman when he gets back in at 5 or 6." They close at 5! She took my phone number and said she would only call me if there was a problem with my package. The only problem with my package is that you a**hole's lost it.

Meh. I got the chicken fried chicken with waffle. The chicken was totally soggy from being fried. To make matters worse they put butter on top of my chicken. Dude what the heck? I should have read the reviews first, dammit! The waffle was plain, they coulda threw some cinnamon or vanilla in there. Service was cordial, but my waitress bought my check when i was half done with my food. I only ordered water because clearly their orange juice is made for the Queen of England at $6 a glass. I wasn't wowed by this place, what's all the hype? You can catch me at Denny's down the street from now on!

This place is not exactly what it seems. Yes the warehouse is big. Yes you will more than likely find something in your price range. However, if you plan on taking something directly from the warehouse be prepared to assemble it. You can not pay extra for them to assemble it. Don't ask if you can purchase it already assembled and don't ask if you can buy the model on the sales floor. The only way to have your furniture assembled is to have it delivered. The delivery is wildly expensive. It starts at $59 and then increases based on your zip code and how many pieces of furniture you are having delivered. I was going to have to pay $89 to deliver a dresser and rocking chair to my house. The salesman told my husband and I that the rocking chair was assembled. We purchased it and rode around to the garage to get it only to find out that it required major assembly. The guy at the loading garage rudely but rather quickly offered me a refund instead of finding some other solution to appease me. I was after all, promised an assembled rocking chair. I accepted the refund because I don't do business with liars. Pruitt's charges a flat rate of $65 to deliver anywhere in the valley and it doesn't matter how many pieces of furniture you order. Their prices are also much better and so is the quality of their products. I thought I would give this place a try but Pruitt's is clearly superior.

My husband and I ordered the 20 piece wings to share  and they were very tasty! They have a very unique taste that I haven't tasted anywhere else! We chose fried boneless style wings with honey BBQ sauce. My only complaint is that the wings weren't tossed well with the honey BBQ sauce-- There were wings that didn't have sauce whatsoever. However, like I said earlier I ordered a 20 piece but they gave me about 25. So you win some and you loose some right? The service was above average for a pizza joint. I will definitely return to try a pizza!

The food here is awesome with the right beer pairing. Even if you don't know anything about craft beer and food pairings anything you eat will be great with any craft beer you order. The bartenders are more than knowledgable, they are experts! The beer is exquisite and the selections change all the time. I would recommend the Hebrew st. Lenny's it is my favorite double IPA and goes very well with the black and blue flatbread. Service is always great for me but I am a regular, I tip very generously and I am just all around loveable. I love this place and I recommend that you try it
