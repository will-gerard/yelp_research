Avoid this place. They tried to hustle my girlfriend for a $45 dollar basic oil change. Until I showed up and got a $10 "discount"   They have false advertisements and constantly change their prices depending on the person who walks in.   They need new management or ownership in order to stay in business.   I will never return.

Wow.....Rick is awesome. I recently broke a small window in my house and it needed to be repaired and replaced. The house was pretty old so I thought the repair would cost me a pretty penny. I called several glass companies to get quotes. Then finally I found Ricks company on yelp. Rick quoted me 50% cheaper than any other company!! I couldn't even believe it. Scheduling was then fast and efficient. He catered to my own personal schedule, giving me an exact time he would be there, unlike those horrible cable companies who tell you, "okay so our guy will be there anytime from 10am-6pm" -   He arrived perfectly on time. My dog is very skittish when strangers enter my home, she's the nicest dog in the world but she likes to bark at strangers. Which is a good thing sometimes. Rick brought dog treats inside for her and she warmed up to him soon after. As for the work, it took only 15 minutes and they installed a brand new thick single pane glass and weather proofed the window so air wouldn't leak anymore.   I don't usually leave long reviews like this but this company deserves it. There needs to be more companies like this out there.   Quality: 5 stars!! Price: 5 stars!! Customer service: 5 stars!!  Every aspect of Ricks company's deserves 5 stars!

Currently I've been waiting for my food for 45 minutes and it's dead. This will definitely be the last time I spend my money here. Take your business elsewhere. The food and service is nothing to get excited over.

It's rare that I give a place 5 stars but if you're looking for quick healthy food this is the place for you. Lots of flavor and good customer service.

This was my go to when I lived in Tempe. The food is excellent and pretty high quality. The service can be a little slow at times so in order to avoid this I call ahead and order my meals to go.
