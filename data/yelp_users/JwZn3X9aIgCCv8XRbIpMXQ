I received a color service which ended up being extremely far from what I had asked for, expected, and payed for. For starters, my hair is now orange with blonde high lights when I asked for a dark brown ombré. My stylist promptly scheduled me for a week later to fix my hair; I booked although hesitant. When I left the salon, I had much distaste considering I was leaving 5 hours later with unacceptable hair. I then called to correct the situation and was denied a refund and told that was against policy. They did however offer to fix my hair, but after one mess up I don't think I'll be back. Just irritated I have to spend twice as much as I already have to fix what they did.

Came in on a busy Friday lunch shift and Britney was our server. She was amazing. Not only did she keep our beers full, but she kept us laughing. She also engaged and brought other girls to our table like Smashley, which I hope is not her rear name. Nonetheless Smash was smiling and happy to bring us our drink refills. The manager even came by to welcome us and invited us back. I love Twin Peaks.
