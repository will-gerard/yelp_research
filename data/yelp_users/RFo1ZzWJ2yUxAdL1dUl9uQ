Very much your classic mixture of Asian cuisine, mainly Vietnamese in one place. Servers have gotten better over the years, more attentive to orders. All of the food come out super quick! Definite plus.   My family and I ordered the salt & pepper squid (calamari), house chicken, beef pho, Chinese broccoli, and house fried rice. All very delicious & our regular orders to say the least. We always get Thai iced teas as well.   Saigon pho is my fave restaurant for pho in the east valley!

The burgers are fresh and hearty, but the lettuce provided kept falling out of my burger. But overall the guacamole bacon cheeseburger was fantastic! The fries could've used a little less salt.

This is hands down, one of my favorite spots for date night! The ambience is romantic with hanging lights, as well as the European feel of the restaurant. We ordered the antipasto, a perfect combination of meats, cheese, tomatoes, olives, etc. We then decided to get the Siena pizza, with prosciutto and zucchini. It was my boyfriend's birthday and our server was lovely enough to whip up a free Nutella crepe, with a lit candle. All in all, perfect place for date night!

Never had Indian food until tonight and this place definitely satisfied our desire for something unique! I got the mahi mahi masala and my boyfriend got the shrimp korma, which were both delicious! Besides that the garlic naan was amazing with the sauces.

The food was absolutely delicious! My family ordered to go and we got Pad Thai, Pra Ram, and Chicken Panang. Though the Panang was a little on the, "a little too spicy," side, the sauce itself was great. The pad Thai was ah-mazing! I've never had better, but there was less meat than I expected. Still, very yummy! Pra Ram is my boyfriend's favorite & Tum Nak Thai did not disappoint!   In our order, they forgot to add the peanut sauce to the Pra ram, which is why I'm giving them one star less. The woman at the front of the store was rushing everything, even ordering on the phone & if they would've taken their time, I bet there wouldn't have been a second trip back, to get the peanut sauce.   The food was delicious and I'm glad I've found a great Thai restaurant by my house.

I've been going to Cornish Pasty for a long time now, inconsistently when I'm usually craving a Shirley temple pudding or just a flaky, meat & cheese filled pasty! I recommend trying the Rosemary chicken or the Greek. There is also an extensive beer list and happy hour is the best time to go. Unique ambience and amazing pub food.

I ordered the Shio Ramen and it was delicious! Although it was a tad salty for my taste. But it's a great price for the amount you get of soup. Definitely a unique place!

This is my absolute favorite place for Thai food in the valley. The staff is courteous and prompt with orders, drink refills, and have a witty sense of humor! My favorite entrees to order are yellow curry and Pra Ram! The peanut sauce is to die for. Lastly, the sticky rice with mango dessert is a must try! Definitely recommend this place!

They fixed my battery in no time at all, maybe five minutes and even gave me a generous discount for being a first time customer and a Yelper! Highly recommend

This is a casual, yet sophisticated place to eat. We got the corned beef, a traditional pub entree, quinoa black bean burger as well as the Scotch eggs, which were all equally delicious. But I highly recommend the Scotch eggs because it's so unique!

I love Chipotle's food and the fact that they are hormone-free in their ingredients. But I received the worst service at this location. When the employee refilled the salad lettuce, he spilled and replaced it back in the bowl and served it onto someone's salad. My sour cream had hair in it and the cashier was not attentive to my order, which led to an overpayment. The  employees' attitudes were very careless and a majority, not all, treated their customers with little respect. Very displeased with this location.

We ordered the grilled artichoke that had truffle oil on it as well as the Meatball pizza which were both spectacular! The grilled red onions added a nice sweet touch to the pizza.

Holy crap! This place was amazing. Having tried a different ramen shop in Tempe, I was doubtful since that didn't live up to expectations. But Umami was superb! I got the paitan broth, with chicken and a hard boiled egg (a classic addition). The one thing I would hope to change is how salty the broth is. Can't wait to try different options for my next visit.

I come here at least once every two weeks & everything from the chips to the drinks are spectacular! My favorite drinks are the  Pineapple Mojito or Key Largo. Both are refreshing. The beast burrito with no sauce, chimichanga style is my absolute favorite along with the Mexican Street Corn! Definite place to try if you're in Old Town Gilbert.

Similar to BoSa doughnuts though donuts were more dry. Wish there was more of a variety in the donuts!

My boyfriend and I have been dying to try this new restaurant for a while & our experience was pretty amazing.   I enjoyed the fact that the burger meat was slightly burned on the edges, yet still moist in the middle. I added on the garlic aioli, lettuce(deliciously crisp), tomatoes, and the BurgerFi sauce to my single meat, cheeseburger. He got the double meat, custom burger, no cheese, with pretty much the same toppings + pickles. Alongside our burgers, we ordered salt and vinegar fries. The flavor was spot on what flavors we expected, yet it wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. Knowing that, I'll probably order the crispy fries next time.   The prices are on the higher side, especially for college students, so I won't be a regular due to this. Another negative is the fact that avocado was not an option for a topping; as an avid burger consumer, I feel as though for gourmet-ish joint like BurgerFi, it should have this as an option.

Found this repair shop on Yelp! and it was so quick and efficiently done. The total was slightly cheaper than the retail store and guaranteed faster than the Apple Store. I even got a free tempered glass cover for simply checking in. I would highly recommend them to anybody that needs repair!

Overall, a great dinner. The server was friendly & very patient especially with our strange questions related our naïveté to Peruvian food. The purple corn drink is a must try!

I enjoyed my experience at waxing the city very much. So much so, that I've recommended them to several friends already. My cerologist, Jordan, was personable and allowed me to make decisions on what I wanted done with my brows. Will definitely come back!

Delicious freaking food! The yogurt dip with naan was amazing. Protein bowl with beef is a must. The quinoa is adequately seasoned & the portion size is perfect. My boyfriend got the zucchini linguine, which was yummy too! The "pasta" was al dente! Plus, the ambience is so eclectic and unique; it has been a great experience. I will most definitely be back to try others.

The doughnuts are super unique and I LOVE LOVE cake donuts over the ones that melt in your mouth. I got a custom one with mocha glaze & Oreos and graham cracker crumbs on top, whereas my s.o. got the blackberry cobbler. The employees even greeted us with wide grins & explained the process of ordering. Both were superb. Must try!

The ice cream flavors weren't anything too exciting and the employees indeed would touch themselves and handle cones soon after. The service was slow & understandably so, since it's their opening day. There was no definite leader/manager, which I'm sure made it all the more stressful. On a side note, a couple things on the menu were spelled wrong. To be a professional and reputable business, that should be fixed. The menu, chalked on the wall, looked as though someone in high school wrote it. Hopefully that gets fixed soon.   All in all, mediocre ice cream, sub-par service, and they should invest in more seating inside and a garbage can somewhere perhaps?

This place was delicious & very reasonably priced. I got the Thai Eggplant, which had A LOT of veggies (YUM!) and my boyfriend got the avocado curry. As an appetizer, we got the Spring Rolls and the side salad it came with had the tastiest peanut sauce dressing. Must try if you're in Tempe! Only negative: they use biodegradable plates & bowls, but it goes straight into a plastic bag, which then serves ultimately no good for the environment. For those eating in, real plates and utensils ADDS to the experience.

The food was exceptional! I got the golden Pomona fish dish and my fiancée ordered the beef Tajine and they were so tasty. Never have we ever had food like that & ate our whole meal. I was hoping for Moroccan styled desserts, but it was simply gelato and fruity shakes. But overall, a well deserved 5 stars for amazing food! Everyone needs to come here
