I own a PR firm and have my workspace in the loft at monOrchid and LOVE it!  I have been visiting the art gallery and attending events in this fabulous space for years, and it's one of my favorite buildings hands down in downtown Phoenix.  I also utilize it for events of my own and for clients, and everyone who walks in the doors falls in love with the building's architectural details and history.

Ack!  So I was terribly excited while waiting months and months for Giant to open because 1) I like the tucked away location 2) I love coffee and 3) We spend a lot of time at the library.  So this morning after scooping up some Krispy Kreme donuts (mmmm) to take over to my friend Kate's house for brunch, I decided to pop by and grab a coffee to go since the previous 2 attempts at visiting Giant were met with a "closed" sign.  I gave 2 stars because I really do like the space.  There were a few people hanging out and I walked up to the counter where 2 girls were working.  The girl behind the cash register was talking to a guy at the counter.  I then saw the cash only sign which wasn't such a big deal to me as I had some cash in my car today, though normally I don't and probably wouldn't have made the trek to CVS as I was in a hurry and had my 3 yr. old in tow.  I asked the girl not talking if she could start my drink while I ran out to get my money.  She told me to order from the other girl.  I took two steps to my left and stood behind the chatting guy.  They kept chatting.  No bueno.  I looked at the other girl again who was just standing there, and again asked her if I could order my drink.  She looked at the talking girl and finally said "sure."  I ordered 2 shots of espresso over ice with a shot of vanilla.  My summer morning caffeine jolt.  I was told by said girl that she couldn't make this for me.  "Excuse me????"  I was told that she was not allowed to make this, as the espresso was to only be ordered in so it could be drank (drunk?) within 10 minutes for the "flavor branding" of Giant.  I tried to persuade her again, letting her know I didn't want to drink it there - nor did I want to drink it hot, as I'd just been hanging out in a 105 degree parking lot for the past hour.  I was told "no."  NO????  SERIOUSLY???  This girl - who I didn't even know - was telling me what I could or couldn't drink when I hadn't had ANY caffeine yet!  It's probably a good thing my daughter was with me after all, as being turned down for espresso + PMS don't co-exist very happily.  She asked if I'd like something different.  I simply said "no," when I really wanted to say oh so much more with included %%$$&*(#*$^$ words.    I will not be back.  Thankfully there are other options (with my #1 being Royal Coffee) and I would have even made the trip up to Lux if I hadn't been in a hurry.  So french pressed coffee at Kate's it was, and I would strongly recommend that Matt get over his "flavor branding" theory if he wants to thrive and to teach his employees the concept of the customer being right if they are polite, have cash, and aren't asking for something ridiculously out of the ordinary.  Jeesh.

My most favorite coffee in Phoenix.  And I'm a coffee snob.  Because I loooooove coffee.  Hayes also makes a tasty bowl of oatmeal too.  Served with raisins + walnuts + brown sugar.  Mmmmmm...    My son used to go to school nearby so I was there almost every morning.  I miss it.  Especially the smell...    Most things (quoting Tom Robbins) are either YUCK or YUM.  Royal at the Market is 100% YUM!

Love love love.  My morning addiction. Coffee is excellent, boys are always entertaining, crepes are deeeelish, music is awesome, and I can hole up in the cute little living room and work while I get jacked up on caffeine. Oh! And the oatmeal too! Mmmmm...  This is a REAL coffee shop. The kind where people have conversations and you run into people you know - or meet new friends. If you suck, please don't ever, ever come here and feng up our shui.   JoBot - I love you.

Warning: snarky review ahead.  Living Room gained a star because I really do like the space, and I did really want to support a neighborhood biz.  Unfortunately, they blew it.  I host a monthly event called Rogue Green and held it at the Living Room a few months back. They extended happy hour drink prices to us as I had 40+ people attend and they were still trying to build business. We had to scream over the music, which never did get turned down.  I also have met friends at the space on several occasions, brought my kids in for dinner, and have tried to give constructive criticism, as I wanted them to succeed.   The music really is AWFUL and TOOOOOO LOUD!  After reading all of the other reviews, how many times do people need to say it? A place called The Living Room just shouldn't have crappy, blaring music. it should be loungy. Or jazzy. Or anything basically other than what it is.  So in a pinch for a space for my event last week, I called to see if they had room for us so I could give it one more shot. The manager was supposed to get back to me to let me know what kind of special they could offer (happy hour pricing, etc.)  Every other place around town I've held my events has bent over backwards to be accommodating. After all, I'm bringing in a group of people who drink, usually eat, and tip really well. I don't make money off the events and it's about supporting local business.  The manager didn't get back to me until the afternoon before the event to inform me that the owner wasn't willing to do anything for us because "they hadn't been hitting their sales numbers." I told her I didn't care if they even picked one beer and one wine and put them on special - just something - as I was bringing in a bunch of people and they usually totally clear out after happy hour ends, and we'd probably be there until 9p. She said she'd talk to the owner and get back to me. She didn't. I called her the next afternoon and she said she couldn't reach them. Whatever...  Once again, the music at the back of the space was BLARING. Everyone had to shout. I was told by the manager twice that "That's how the owner wants it, sweetie." Ick. Really? What about what your patrons want? There's a concept, eh?!  So most of us left and went over to the patio of Main Ingredient. And they were nice to us. And once my ears finally stopped ringing, I actually had a good time.  So stick it in your ear Living Room. You can't move into a real neighborhood and not act neighborly. Your customer service sucks and so do your speakers. IT'S TOOOOO LOUD! Think ambiance or change your name to Living Deaf.

To Sarah l. -  Buy a box of wine and stay at home? Funny, you sound like you're probably an employee or something...  The point is that those of us who live downtown and do events to help PROMOTE local businesses are typically treated much more professionally - like had the manager gotten back to me when they said they would, I would have probably held the event somewhere else.  Groups of 40+ people boost sales - that's a typical no brainer.  If this restaurant can sustain itself on only having a decent happy hour crowd, but not listening to the people who live in the neighborhood, I'll be surprised if they last a year.  The good thing is that there are many great restaurants downtown who DO appreciate patronage and what the customers think - and apparently I'm not the only one who thinks the music is ungodly loud and their speakers suck.
