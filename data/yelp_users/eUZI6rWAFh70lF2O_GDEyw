Way too many fucking issues.   Lets start with the customer service when you call for a cab.  Unprofessional, talk in slang.  I called for a cab and then got a call telling me my cab was there, went downstairs never saw the cab.   Called the taxi service number and they kept insisting that i was the idiot n said well the cab is there waiting for you.  Puts me on hold and tells me 5 minutes later to tell them what im wearing.  I said a black shirt and why is that relevant.  Lady says quietly we're going to send another cab.    I said another cab? There wasnt ever a first one.  She insisted yea there was until she finally admits 30 seconds later yea sorry he wasnt there.  How the fuck can u call me to tell me my cab is waiting downstairs when they werent ever there.       Now my actual can driver.  First thing he asks can u pay cash? I said sorry i only have card, then he goes, " can we stop by atm?"   I said no because im already late enough because of your company.  I know its not your fault but i need to get to te tempe campus for a meeting.    Thia fucker still asks to stop at the atm cause its 2 blocks away.   He doesnt fucking understand i dont have time.   Then asks for directions to tempe campus.  Idiot gets lost and asks to borrow my phone as gps.   Fucking whack.

Don't have a single problem with this place.   From my first time going all the way to my most recent time, I've always experienced the best service.  They're very knowledgeable and always willing to teach their customers more about their business or share their own opinions.  They are very patient and very friendly as well.     Now their selection is very big compared to many of the other gold bullion and stamp places around phoenix or probably in all of AZ.  I recently moved here from CA, and have went to many gold bullion and stamp stores, and this is by far the one with the biggest selection.    They won't have EVERY single size and country that makes gold coins, but they do have their share of interesting things.   They don' jUST have gold, they have a LOT of silver as well, a big selection of notes, old US coins, and coin supplies.    Negative things others may say that shouldn't be a factor into a low rating.    People who come here often are impatient and get mad that they don't get helped right away.  Note that they are very attentive to Every single customer they come across and that some customers may have a lot of questions.  Blame the  customer who came before you, not the people who work there.    Come on a day when you aren't in some rush.  I come on days that I want to just relax and have nothing planned, that way I'm never in a rush when i come and heck, I may see things I haven't seen before in the store, or you may actually see something you like that others bring in.    Another thing people may get mad about is getting turned down for having fakes.   For example.  If I was a gentleman who came in with 20 silver dollars and was told they are fake, I'd be pretty mad.  But I would not express my anger towards the person who told me they are fake.  It is NOT their fault, nor did they sell you those fake silver dollars.  DO your own research people.  It ISN'T that hard to get into this stuff.      I'll be honest.  I'm guilty of being someone who used to think coin collecting or gold and silver was for weird and nerdy people because I used to think this stuff was complicated.  But in the end I became one of them.  This is probably the easiest thing to understand and learn about, and of the smartest things you can do for security and insurance reasons(unless ur a numismatist)   This place overall is a great place to Not only sell gold n silver but to bring in rare collectable items.  Both selling and buying is important to them.  Have a good day everyone.

Just left this place LAUGHING MY ASS OFF!!!   I walked in to look for DEXTROSE.  DEXTROSE POWDER.  They didn't have it when i looked around. No big deal right? THe store is nice, has a lot of products.    BUT, the guy who worked inside, looked like he worked out, and looked intelligent.  Tall, built, dark haired white guy.   He told me yea they don't carry it.  He offered to help me find a place that carries dextrose.  He looked it up and told me nothing came up when he typed in "D-E-C-S-T-R-O-S"     I intentionally gave him a weird look and said no its spelled DEXTROSE.  He said aww cmon Gimme a break i'm off one letter.      He looked it up and still nothing.  I said uh that's weird.... try, D-Glucose. Nothing came up.    He said yea never heard of it all my years here.  LOL!!!!! I PAUSED AND GAVE HIM A 8 SECOND STARE.  a full 8 second stare.  THINK ABOUT HOW LONG THAT REALLY IS.  And i said, It's a simple sugar and you've never heard of it????.......   Sir.....you work for a nutrition store, yet you don't know what a simple sugar is.  You're a joke bro.  Great job representing the GNC name.  GNC employees have reached a new level of "Stupid".   LOLLOLOLOL WHAT AN IDIOT!!!! I hope he reads this.  I laughed SO SO Hard when i left the door and told my best friend right away.  I'd give 0 stars, cause this employee made this GNC location look like a joke.  BUT i'll give one star cause I had a great laugh today.

This fry's electronics is full of the most useless people i have ever met.  They dont train ANY of their employees even their repair techs.   I brought jn my laptop to get it fixed and have diagnosed it myself that i need to replace their hard drive.  They took in my laptop and said it will take about a week to repair, and then the tech said that they will give me a loaner laptop for the time being with the same specs as my own laptop.  Expecting an i7 processor laptop, they ended up giving me a piece of shit duo core.  And i told them dont worry about it because it's only going to take a week so its no big deal.     A week goes by i call frys electronis for the status update and got put on hold for 20+ minutes i have screenshots of this incompetence.   They told me they didnt have a hard drive for my laptop so they had to put an order.  So it may take about another week.    Another week goes by and they claimed that it was processed and the place that they made an order with has not shipped it out yet.   Another week goes by i called and they claimed that the place they ordered my hard drive from has shipped and should be in any day.   Two weeks goes by they still didnt get it and everytime i call they said that any time now.   Next week goes by,  This time i asked why its taking so ling and they said that they had to place another order and i asked why.  They claimed that the first order never ahipped out or processed.  Then i asked how they got information on how their first order was shipped if it was NEVER PROCESSED.  They had no answer.  Now i got pissed. And asked for the manager. I told the useless tech on the phone with me that this is a training issue, and he admitted to not having any training.  What a joke  The manager explained to me why they took so long and that mistakes happen and that he later explained that i wasnt even supposed to get a loaner laptop of the same specs so it was normal for me to have that piece of shit for 5 weeks while waiting.  Im a college student and it was bad enough i lost everything.    Then i told him to read over my repair report, he then told me that they HAVE MY HARD DRIVE IN STOCK THE WHOLE TIME.  I got fucking pissed.   So my order for repair couldve been done since DAY 1.  My entire repair papers were on IDLE the entire fucking time.  This is ALL due to negligence and lack of training.  So NONE OF THE TECHS for 5 fucking weeks didnt bother to check their inventory.  And they didnt even NOTIFY me they placed a second order for a hard drive had i not called.  FUCK  THIS FRYS ELECTRONICS. Your techs are FUCKING useless.  Your department and branch is a fucking joke.  I prety much had a piece of sht laptop for 5 weeks and had so much trouble because i had no Microsoft products for word excel and powerpoint which are programs i REALLY NEED in college. So i pretty much had a useless laptop when i could've had mine repaired in two days. The supervisor said im afraid so sir.  FUCK Fry's warranty.  They don't do SHIT for you.    After having my laptop for a week when I got it back, I realized that I needed the product key to enter it into my system for windows 7.  So i gave them a call and asked what my product key is, and addressed the issue that they should've done this for me when they installed a new windows 7 product.  I gave them a call and they told me to bring it in.  ARE U FUCKING KIDDING ME I told them im not goingback to your store and your branch specifically.  This is a PRODUCT key you guys should have it on file.  then he goes on to tell me that I need to bring it in to enter it for me.  I told the guy, tell me where it is.  The guy ends up telling me that its inside my laptop where the battery is and tells me it should be on the outside.  I told them no if it would be anywhere itd be on the inside.... I found it myself and told him, ok you honestly don't know what you're doing bye.  and hung up.  There was NO REASON why i NEEDED to drive to their fucking store to get this done.  The Techs have NO fucking idea what they are doing.  Useless.  Rick Ebel, Service department manager.  you are fine.  But YOU need to train your techs and your employees.  Fire them and switch for new ones.  Your current techs have no idea what they are doing.  YOU need to properly TRAIN your employees.  What I experienced for over a month was unprofessional, and full of negligence.
