I'll preface this by saying that my family has been going to this Olive Garden for years. I really truly wish I could give it a better rating based on the fact that there are a few servers and other staff that are really great and it used to be a well run restaurant. However, things have gone downhill the last year and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. The last two visits we have made have both been for birthday dinners. Last visit left us a little less than satisfied with inattentive servers, being seated next to a group of 30 who decided they could take up half the room for their office party complete with applause, and waiting 20 minutes past everyone else's food arriving for my entree which was then so hot I had to take it home to eat. I went ahead and filled out the online survey, marked that I wasn't opposed to having a manager call me, and NOTHING. I was hoping it was a bad night and this time it would be better. Unfortunately it wasn't.  We have a large family group and are used to waiting, no big deal. An hour wait when quoted 40 minutes on a Sunday night when the lobby is empty (and some whispers amongst the hosts about not wanting to seat certain servers because they want to go home) gets a little annoying, but I digress.  We are sat at a table pushed together almost right in a traffic area(we were paranoid of getting elbows and trays to the head the whole time) and one flustered server gave the greeting and walked away without taking any drink orders. At this point we had 3 small children who already were getting tired as it was nearing bedtime after the wait. Waiting for drinks and putting orders in took forever, when we finally brought salads and soups it was already past 9 PM. Then we sat with empty app dishes in front of us for a good 20 minutes with no sign of servers. When my entree came out(shrimp ravioli type dish which was good but nothing amazing) the whole side and bottom of the plate had mashed potatoes on it. I'm hoping someone in our party had mashed potatoes. After eating a bit, most of us were just ready to go home at this point, the kids were sleeping in their chairs, we had to flag down our server who was cleaning tables across the room and ask for our check. We had asked for two cakes earlier for the birthday guy and as we were asking them to just cancel that, the server insisted he had them all set and waiting to go he was just waiting for checks(huh?). So they brought out the cakes and the two servers tried to get our party to sing happy birthday. Poor birthday guy got the most pathetic and tired birthday song ever. When the bill came, that automatic 15% tip added to each bill was just a slap in the face. I know it's customary but being large tippers generally, not having a choice in the matter was offensive at that point. Not to mention the fact that the servers had to have known that our meal took a ridiculous amount of time and we were far from happy, but there was no sign of the manager all night and it was far below what we have come to expect from any Darden restaurant.   We won't be going back to this location if we can help it.

On first glance this place has great reviews, definitely had business as it was packed on a Wednesday afternoon. I guess it really depends on the technician you get because my Mother in law had the sweetest woman who did a great job and spent a lot of time on her manicure. Mine was rushed and little to no interaction, except to try to get me to upgrade to a pedicure (even though I was told earlier on the phone no pedicure appointments were available). My mother in law's manicure still looked good 3 weeks later while mine was donezo within 3 days. I chose a bright coral gel color, the tech was struggling to get anything out of the nearly empty bottle. I offered to choose another color but was brushed off. By the next day I could see the color fading and by a few days later the color had changed to a pale pink. I tried to call but was put on hold multiple times.  After reading previous reviews about how dissatisfied customers are treated, I decided to not even bother.

I was in search of a nearby nail place that had good reviews, Yelp saved me again. They got me in right away for a last minute pedicure. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the very friendly staff, offered cold water, and sat in a comfortable massaging spa chair. I was quoted $25 for a pedicure over the phone yet the "menu" I was handed did not include a pedicure for that price. A little confusing but I opted for the basic pedicure ($20) with a $10 upgrade for an extra 10 minute foot/calf massage. So very worth every penny for that upgrade. I definitely could have fallen asleep in the chair. It was exactly what these aching feet needed. The polish color choices weren't extensive but they had my favorite OPI color so no complaints here. Hopefully they have more colors available for gel as that is what I'll be trying with them next.

I hate having to come back and give a bad review after raving about how much I loved a place. But in one visit Paulene's Nails took me from a happy return customer to never wanting to step foot in the place again.  Long story short, we made appointments for a specific time as it was a birthday and we had dinner plans. They obviously either overbooked or took too many walk in customers. The tech was rude about it and continued to insist we could get in for our appointments and done by a certain time only to do one part of a manicure then go to someone else. We were there for hours. The quality wasn't even good and the customer service was horrible. Not the relaxing atmosphere it used to be. I believe it was under new management.  We won't be back.

This review is for the Minute Clinic inside CVS. At first we thought it wasn't open because the store is under construction but it's just tucked back in the corner and we met with the NP in a small office. The noise from the construction was a bit jarring(especially while sick and with a headache) but they are expanding the Minute Clinic area so I'm sure things will be better in the long run. I signed in and was seen within 30 minutes, the NP Marisa was very personable and nice. She truly cared how I was feeling and made sure she was familiar with my heath history. We were in and out in under an hour. The pharmacy is another story(but I don't want to reduce the minute clinic's rating based on an awful pharmacy experience). This is the perfect option for cold/flu or when you need a quick prescription, they get you in and out quickly and on your way to feeling better.

This place used to be a hidden gem, now something is definitely missing.  This week we had out of town family visiting from California. Being Starwood preferred members and fans of the Wild Horse Pass area from a stay almost 6 years ago, they planned a 5 nights stay. I also got a room for one of the nights to have a mini staycation for my birthday.  5 stars for the resort grounds and view. Watching the sunset over the mountains through the two story floor to ceiling windows in the lobby is an experience. Even being a local used to the AZ sunset, it's a sight to see.   4 stars for self parking not being convenient, the rooms being cramped and the pool area. The kids loved the pool complex with two shallow play pools(one with zero water line that is amazing for half submerged tanning and little ones), the water slide was surprisingly fun for young and old alike, and the "adult" pool has some great poolside fountains that are toddler friendly as well. As you can tell, the pool caters to families, it happens. If you want a true adult only pool stay somewhere with a bigger pool complex. Very comfortable lounge chairs and the pool bar staff were prompt and personable. The kids didn't seem to mind that the pool was warm but the adults might need some cool drinks to deal with the heat. The margaritas were nasty(unforgivable in AZ, especially on national tequila day) but the blood orange mojito was so refreshing. Be aware that the bottom of the pool is in dire need of resurfacing, it is a gritty plaster that will tear up your feet and knees if you aren't careful(but great if you desperately need a pedicure).  3 stars for service. The whole week it was pretty hit or miss. Valet service and front desk was very attentive. Restaurant and bar service was great. Any staff you pass will look up and greet you. Pool got iffy as there was only ever one pool attendant for the entire pool and it could take awhile to get service, especially around shift changes in the afternoon. Extra activities like the "boat" rides, you better plan ahead and make sure they know you're coming because apparently they pack up early without letting anyone know. That made for some disappointed kiddos and no one seemed to want to take responsibility for it.The spa needs some scheduling tips as well. We also were brought a piece of chocolate cake(I'm assuming for my birthday?) however it was just left in the room at 10 AM while we were out, without a note, and it was in my family's room not mine so who knows for sure. Um, thanks?  What brought it down to 2 stars was cleanliness. The resort is showing signs of neglect in this area. Cleaning crew apparently leave at 11 AM every day so if you don't request room cleaning by 9 AM you don't get it. Seemed more like a condo complex then a resort on that point. Room service trays sat in the hallway for most of the day. Cobwebs all over outside windows, bird droppings in the pool area, and stained carpet and ceiling tiles.  But the clincher was the experience we had with my room. As we were preparing for bed, I was drawing the curtains closed and happened to look up at the valance. The corner was covered in spider webs and 5-6 live spiders! Albeit daddy long legs which are less scary then most spiders out here but still not roommates I appreciate. I then noticed more webs in the opposite corner of the room and another huge (alive) daddy long legs, this corner being almost directly above the bed. This would have been instant grounds to move rooms for me however we were given the room directly next to my family, it was already 1 AM, and a conference had just checked in so we were doubtful of getting another room. Armed with a can of hairspray we killed as many bugs as we could find and slept with a light on the rest of the night. It doesn't matter how amazing that heavenly bed is when you feel like you're going to have bugs on your face all night. I just don't understand how a cleaning crew misses something like that. I was going to let the front desk know but as I was checking out the next day over the phone, she cut me off before I had a chance to and hung up. Let's hope someone actually reads their questionnaires.   There are so many amazing hotel and resort options in the Phoenix area, at great prices too during the summer. Unless they train their cleaning crew better, it's going to hurt their popularity.

The night staff at this location leaves something to be desired. Maybe it was our bad for coming in within 15 minutes of closing to quickly check for a certain shoe for my husband. The cashier was extremely rude as we came in informing us they were closed. The intercom announcement that the store was closed (not closing) came 5 minutes before 9pm and the manager had already locked the door. This is the second time I've been here in the evening and experienced rude employees that seemed to just want to get you out of there. I've shopped at this Kohls many times during their holiday hours and always experienced cheerful staff even at night, it's too bad those people aren't there anymore.

Pricey but the customer service is always great. The wine department is amazing and if they don't have something you want, they will find it for you. A lunch of the salad bar, a sandwich and a couple Julia Baker passion fruit chocolates are my guilty pleasure when I'm on this side of town. Plus they are one of the few places I've found with the larger sizes of ONE coconut water.

Party America is no longer open. The landlord has seized the property with everything inside and it hasn't shown signs of reopening since January 2012. Wish I'd known that before making the trek out to Chandler.

Drinks are strong, food is filling, huge cookie is a must...but don't get your hopes up on service. The family and I went on a Tuesday night for a birthday dinner for my sister's 16th. There were 16 of us, we called ahead and were told they don't take reservations(not even for large parties). We weren't given a wait time since there were supposedly two large party tables we could be sat at, both outside which is apparently the only place they can accommodate parties larger than 8. So we waited 45 minutes for one of those tables to become available. At that point they asked if we would be willing to split between two tables. We were brought back to two booths back to back, both were 6 tops. As you can imagine, fitting 16 people in two booths meant for 12 just did not work. We had three little ones with us and it still was ridiculously uncomfortable.  The poor server was overwhelmed from the very beginning and it snowballed from there. To make it more manageable I think she split us into two separate groups by table and chaos ensued. One table got  food 20 minutes before the other did while one table was cashed out before the other were even asked how we wanted to split checks. The thought that family members from one table would want to pay for their children sitting at the other table confused the server to the point that we asked for her to just make a check for the children and we would pay for a second time.  As far as the food...Just FYI the portions aren't terribly big. Apps like the cheese garlic bread is good to share but the entree salads and pastas aren't very shareable. I ordered a Caesar salad that was said to be "very large" to share with someone else and it was just about enough for one person. A friend got the chicken lasagna and the cheese was burnt to the point of being hard to cut through. My brother got a Caesar with chicken and the chicken was marinated in something that made it very sour. Not impressed. But those that got pizza were happy with it.  Not a great place for large groups, but at least they gave the birthday girl a free deep dish cookie and the server waited until she turned a corner to show how miserable she was.

Delicious pseudo Italian food at an affordable price. Not quite fast food but quick and easy to grab on the way home. Everything is super fresh which makes all the difference in taste. The wine selection is "interesting", haven't found anything I liked but nothing terrible either. We usually get dinner to go so that's usually a nonissue anyway. Only thing that has bothered me in the past is the parking is horrible. It's a poorly planned out lot with tiny spots anyway but on more than one occasion I have seen employees parking right in front. Again not a huge deal but irksome, especially since there is no designated Take Out spot. At most times of the day you'll end up trekking it from far out in the lot if you have anything other than a compact car.

This review is a little late coming, but just got myself some fabulous chocolates and remembered how addicted I am to the passion fruit ones. It's a good things they're so pricey or I would probably eat an entire box. Julia Baker also did our wedding cake in 2010. The cake was a beautiful three tier red velvet. It tasted amazing, we still get compliments on it. Julia and all her employees were a joy to work with, the tasting appointment was one of our favorite parts of wedding planning. Would definitely recommend.  Lost a star because they are a tad bit overpriced. Also the design on our cake was the wrong color, our wedding color was an olive green and the cake design was a bright almost neon green and we had asked for an olive or dark emerald color. If there wasn't a million other things going on I might have stressed about it but as it were the cake tasted great enough to make up for it.  They didn't last too long at the Montelucia, which is usually when I'd stop in for a treat. I'm not sure where they moved but I know that you can buy the truffles and chocolates (seriously try the passion fruit) at AJ's Fine Foods in the area.

Beautiful decor and delicious food. Great for a laid back night out or take out. Patio seating is perfect on nice nights.  The color scheme and great posters make me miss Maui. The iced tea is amazing and the portions are huge, we always have leftovers. No matter what I get I love it. I'm partial to the chicken rice bowl with Hawaiian teriyaki sauce over Rumbi rice. The rice, beans, and coconut in the Rumbi rice is addicting, you've been warned. Just tried the luau pork for the first time too and loved it. The macaroni salad isn't completely what I like, too tart like normal mac salad and not plate lunch quality, but that's personal preference. Mama's tortilla soup is also incredible, a mix of spicy and savory with a hint of coconut milk.  They're slow on weeknights when we're usually there, hopefully busier on the weekends, I'd hate for them to go anywhere.

Weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar. However, we went with a group of friends for the Veteran's Day deal where they provided a free meal to veterans. I was meeting someone for lunch later so I only had a drink, everyone else ordered a meal(including the veterans in our group). Here we are 2 days later and every single person, that ate there all have flu symptoms. I feel fine and coincidentally I didn't order anything to eat. Some line cook was probably sick and they wouldn't let him call out since they were busy for the holiday. Way to give some veterans the flu with their free meal Applebee's!

I really wish I could give this place a better review based on the fact that it looks cool.However, our visit for my brother's birthday left much to be desired.  First, it's no big deal to have to wait. Even on a Thursday night we understand a large party of 5 couples and some kids will have to wait a bit. That didn't bother me but waiting for a table that could comfortably fit 10 with chairs on the corners is kinda sad. The dining room was half empty. There were empty tables all around us and no other large parties. After trying to fit into the table(with one chair short) and realizing our elbows were in each other's sides only sitting there, I asked the host if there was any possible way to add a table. She came over and added one, not sure why they couldn't just do this to begin with but I give them the benefit of the doubt.  The food was good, not the best I've tasted and definitely a bit pricey but the Poke Tuna I got was fresh, it was drowning in a pool of some sort of sauce was strange but helped cut the spicy so I liked it. My husband enjoyed his Ramen, the broth was very good actually. Everyone else seemed to like their meals, despite the fact that the server felt the need to explain everything as if they might change their minds. This also happened when we ordered coffee, it was as if she thought if we knew it was a french press we wouldn't want it. Because of this it did take a very long time for us to get it. When I was brought mine she told me she would have to come back in a minute to press it down for me since it wasn't ready yet. After a few minutes and no sign of her I did it myself and had to tell her when she did come over and apologize that I was familiar with french press coffee and could handle it. The overall dinner service definitely dragged.  The most awkward part of the night came at the end when we were waiting for our checks after explaining we really truly didn't need dessert.(They brought ice cream with a candle for my 26 yr old brother anyway). A large group was seated near us and it seemed they had the same dilemma of too many people for too small of a table. They stood there very near us as a host and server gestured at our table and after a couple minutes walked them back to the front. A few minutes later(while we were still waiting on checks, nothing we could do to try to give up our table and believe me too many of us have worked in the service industry to be table hogs), they were brought back in and shown that the host had set up another table for 6 right next to the original table they were given. More gesturing and stink eyes shot in our direction, then the party went back out front and their original table was expanded to be longer. I'm not sure what the deal is with this place but large parties really shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Especially on a slow Thursday night.   We may try this place again for Happy Hour sushi but this trip just didn't do much for me considering we spend $40 without any sushi or alcoholic drinks. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party unless you really enjoy sitting on each others laps and having the pace of meal drag because your sole server is obviously overwhelmed not to mention doesn't have much faith in the product.

First time in this week since the new owners took over. Have to say as much as I liked this place before, they definitely took all the good parts and expanded on it. I always liked the bar and the small couch seating area, now the bar is just as amazing as ever with friendly and knowledgeable staff and the entire place is mostly "conversation groupings" with comfortable arm chairs and couches with a few tall tables here and there. Not to mention, they carry Rombauer Chardonnay by the glass! Sure it's a bit too pricey at $15 a glass but after a rough week it was exactly what I needed and the size was definitely generous. This is the first time I've found it by the glass on this side of town so I was definitely in my happy place. Can't wait until the girls get together here and give the new menu a try.

Great pedicure today with the mother in law, they get you right in with no wait. This place would have to be insanely packed for them to not have an open chair. It was busy when we went in but we were given two great massage chairs and friendly nail techs. The lavender pedicure was amazing, with a salt scrub and extra long foot and leg massage. I could have fallen asleep in that chair, it was wonderful. When you're finished they send you right over to put your toes under the UV lights, they only have one small UV table so it wasn't available but I get that they try to get the massage chairs cleaned and ready for the next person in a hurry.  Only tip is to bring your own reading material. I didn't see any magazine racks and there isn't anything next to the pedicure chairs so once you sit down you're kinda stuck. I also brought my own polish which worked out for me since their polish collection isn't huge and with the amount of business they do, the color you want may be already out or practically empty.

Another amazing weekend at the Montelucia. This may be a long one but they deserved it this time.   My husband and I spent our first anniversary here this weekend and they really took care of us. We were given a great rate and they also upgraded us upon check-in to our favorite area in the resort, in building 1 right above Prado. We had an amazing view of Camelback mountain and spent every evening of the weekend on our balcony enjoying the sunset.  Jessica at the concierge helped me out so much in planning a romantic weekend, she assisted me in booking our room well in advance, came up with ideas for special touches, and answered all my questions. She also came up and said hello while we were checking in. We were also brought a bottle of Prosecco upon arriving in our room with a hand written note from guest relations. What really impressed us was the fact that any of the front desk or concierge we interacted with remembered us by name and commented on our anniversary. I wish I remembered the name of the gentleman that checked us in because he was so helpful and welcoming as well.   As always, our room was amazing, the bed is to die for(I miss it now that I'm home) and we enjoyed exploring the resort all over again. We had breakfast at Crave one morning and Prado for dinner Saturday night. Prado as always was incredible. They won my heart a little bit more for having added Rombauer Chardonnay to their wine list. There was a mix up with having our anniversary cake brought to us and it was too frozen to cut into for dessert, but I appreciated them accommodating us and trying to make it work. Plus we got to have the Prado sundae for dessert instead and oh my goodness was it good. Gelato, chocolate, and bacon. Wow.   Only downside was the pool situation, while better then last year by a long shot, it is still a little out of hand. Understandably they can't reserve lounge chairs but we ended up having to keep our stuff on a couple fold out chairs in the corner that were even too rickety to sit on. Later I happened to be walking by as a family was leaving and snagged a couple chairs. We found out the girls next to us were from ASU and not guests, then their five friends showed up and it all made a little more sense why we couldn't find anywhere to sit. On Sunday we made sure to get there extra early to get the great lounge chairs with the canopy and while we had a group of locals partying next to us again the pool area was much calmer. It was not even enough of a bother to take away a star but it was a little annoying and they could do better at keeping crashers out.   We had an memorable weekend that definitely brought back all the magic of having our wedding day there a year ago.

I honestly don't understand the good reviews. The few times I've visited the drive through at this location something has been wrong. Last time they handed me someone else's order and only caught it as I was driving away. Also the iced coffees we got were undrinkable they tasted so stale. Today they were out of hashbrowns, okay no big deal, I ordered a donut and breakfast sandwich. My order was repeated twice but I was handed one bag before paying. I guess I have to double check my order before driving away (even when there are multiple cars in line) because my breakfast sandwich was not in the bag. When I finally got a hold of someone I was told I could come back for it. Being that I'm already at work I asked if I could come by later and have it refunded, the first person I talked with said yes then the manager told me that she tried to catch me before I drove away but I could come by anytime for a free sandwich. Um, I paid and was given my food and told to have a nice day it's not my fault that I left.  I am not in that area much anymore but even if I was, I'm not wasting my time or energy going back for another sandwich. They can keep my 3 bucks.

I have been to It's A Grind far too many times to have not reviewed it yet. Oops! This place has been my favorite coffee shop in the East Valley for a quick coffee for years. Used to hit the drive thru for a "nutty cow" and bagel with cream cheese on my way to early classes or work shifts. They don't mess around with their cream cheese, you get your money's worth. Alas I moved to another part of town and am not as close to them anymore and can't justify driving 10 miles out of my way just to get a coffee. But when in Gilbert, I will stop in whenever I can. Lately I've rediscovered my love of a good quick coffee from a place that doesn't burn their espresso(desperate times called for desperate measures) and I stumbled upon their little gem called a Rocket Latte. This thing is small but it packs a punch. It tastes like a strong coffee, I get mine with a couple raw sugars, but it is as much caffeine as you could possibly need.  I have never had a negative customer service experience here. Whether in the drive thru or going in to snag a comfy armchair to do some paperwork or chat with a friend, I have always been greeted with a smile and a great attitude. Keep up the good work guys, you're doing something right.

I wish I could write this place two reviews, because the difference between when you go is like night and day. Might as well be two different places.  Weeknights are great. This is the place to lounge around on their beautiful patio with a glass of wine(or three) and amazing small plates. A great spot for warm summer nights. Service was impeccable and prices were perfect. Plus the staff actually know their stuff when it comes to their wines and what to recommend.   But then there's the weekend... Made the mistake of taking the husband on a Friday night and we didn't even stay for a drink. Apparently this is THE place for the Chandler cougar crowd and the 40-50 somethings acting like bnoxious 20 year olds. I hate to generalize but when you walk in and get the stink eye from three 60 yr old ladies in mini skirts, it hardly encourages affection. We walked in and the place was packed. It's a bar on a weekend, that's to be expected. But there was no one around with a wait list, and the place isn't set up to have a lobby or really even a host stand. All I could assume was that it was a free for all seating plan and we didn't feel like wading through the mob of  soccer dads in affliction shirts to try to reach the bar.   Definitely can't recommend on the weekend, and if you do attempt it, keep in mind that there is absolutely nothing else in the area as far as bars or nightlife so you may be stuck trekking it into Chandler or Tempe to find something else to do. As for me, I'm not so sure I'm going to risk heading out there anywhere near a weekend unless the vibe changes drastically.

Delicious authentic tapas, incredible sangria, and mouth watering paella. The patio area is very intimate with a great ambiance, even if seated next to super obnoxious drunk tourists who pronounce tapas as "taay-puhs".  This has been our go to for special occasions such as an anniversary or New Year's Eve. But it's also a great pick me up for a weekday when a craving for sangria strikes. Either way we get great service every time. It's definitely an experience, one that continues to surprise with something exciting or undiscovered every visit. Even the bread and garlic aioli is incredible. Gambas al ajillo is another favorite. I have a garlic addiction, what can I say?  As an AZ native, the thought of fancying up a canal and calling it the "waterfront" is hilarious. But the patio does have a really relaxing vibe next to the water and you can forget for a moment that a canal isn't terribly exciting.

The bestie and I decided on a whim to check out iPic since we were in the area for brunch and shopping and decided going to dinner would be a bit excessive. One of us remembered iPic was nearby and we'd been wanting to see Titanic while it was in theaters. So we walked in and got a couple "premium" seats for $18.50, and settled in for a great movie.  Pros- Impressive lobby area Ability to choose exact seats(and reserve ahead of time) Comfortable seats with adjustable tray Self serve wine "tower" with good selection(Rombauer chardonnay!) Even the front rows are set back enough from the screen to be comfortable Crazy cool bathrooms  Cons- Not very user friendly at front desk, maybe because we didn't reserve seats Employees don't seem to know much about food/drink menu and were less than helpful when asked for glasses or when wine tower wasn't working. Price point, $18.50 isn't terrible but $27 for the extra special seats (before food or drink)is a bit excessive. Very little self parking available. Valet is validated but there can be a long line.  Overall good experience enjoying a glass of wine with the bestie while watching a young Leonardo DiCaprio in comfortable seats. Not much customer service unless you're willing to shell out the big bucks. We will probably check out other theaters with this same concept or visit again on a week night when there aren't the hoards of cougars and people seeing movies in club wear.

Great coffee spot with friendly baristas and lots of room to spread out. This place is perfect for study sessions and meeting with friends. They've got a little something for everyone. Plenty of tables, couches, kids play room, and a small patio area. Pretty sure it's too close to the entry for the smokers though(if that's your thing). The coffee is great, good quality and they know how to pull a shot. Mango tea is also to die for.  Love the concept and the community responsibility this place promotes. It's a positive environment, "coffee with a cause".  I've only just stopped in for a quick coffee while they had open mic, it gets kinda loud and packed but looks pretty popular. As with any open mic, there's good and bad but it's entertaining to say the least. I don't live very close but when I'm in the area I stop by and am always glad I did. Support local businesses and see for yourself, too many independent coffee shops don't get the recognition they deserve.

Great coffee, friendly people, and the yummiest monkey bread cupcake I've ever eaten. This little coffee shop is just what downtown Mesa needed. It's got a relaxed vibe and the coolest exposed brick walls. Plenty of places to sit and things to read. The baristas are always nice and talkative and make a mean iced latte(no burnt tasting espresso here, unlike that place that starts with an S).  Great place for people watching, conversation with a friend, and the surfing the interwebs. The iPad cash register is pretty cool too.  The only thing is it can get kinda crazy whenever there is a show at the venue it's attached to. Not too bad inside but lots of teens hanging around outside. Don't be an old fuddy duddy and you'll be fine.

The Bestie and I decided to try out Primp and Blow for our first ever blow dry bar experience. This was the beginning of a great night out for dinner and seeing Wicked at Gammage. Let me just say these women made us look and feel  AMAZING. At first the price point was iffy for me but when I saw the work and pampering they put into it, I would do this again and again. We went ahead and made appointments over the phone(though I can't imagine they're too necessary on a wednesday night, we were the only two there the whole time) and were brought right back when we arrived. After a very relaxing shampoo and conditioner with scalp massage, we were seated at an adorable little station, offered complimentary champagne(they also offer wine, tea, and water) and offered an Ipad with magazines on it to look at.  Both of our stylists were awesome, I wish I had remembered their names now, and while mine didn't talk very much, she worked magic with that blowdryer and round brush. I didn't ask for much, next time I may have them do something a bit more complex but as any style requiring a hot tool is $10 extra, I decided to stick with the basic and see how I liked it. She did an amazing job and my hair was full and I felt like a million bucks all night. The Bestie has much shorter hair than I do and her stylist did an incredible job on hers too, this place is great for short hair as well! They even gave her a discount since it didn't take as long.  Overall, I loved the vibe and the salon "attitude" wasn't as catty as many other places. We will definitely be going back, we may start looking for excuses for a night out just so we can go be pampered and turned into bombshells again.

I have been in this store twice and both times were met with less than stellar customer service. The first time my sister was yelled at for setting a drink down on a table for a moment. The second I was flat out ignored while the owner sat at the register on the phone the entire time talking about very personal things and arguing about debt and store profits. It was very uncomfortable to the point that I chose not to purchase a couple items because I didn't want to interrupt her conversation.  It really is too bad because I am all for small businesses opening and thriving in Downtown Gilbert. The store has some cute items(albeit a tad overpriced) that would be tempting if the owner showed some more professionalism.

I give them stars for having cute clothes in good condition for cheap. Some of the staff are very nice. I recommend this place to friends looking for 2nd hand baby clothes. The gear seems a bit overpriced but it's all in good condition. Selling here is another story. It's incredibly difficult to get your stuff to the buying area, and there is nowhere to put anything so there are piles of stuff everywhere. You find a space where hopefully no one will trip over your items and they won't end up in someone else's pile. Then you wait. Today it was over an hour and a half before they gave me an offer. Others came in after me and were seen and given an offer within 20 minutes. Not sure if they are really that disorganized or just forgot me. If you're lucky they'll take a few things. If not you just wasted your afternoon to be offered $5. Which, let's be honest, you end up spending and more when you've been walking around the store while you wait. You can leave your items there, but you have to sign off that you will accept whatever they offer you. No thanks. Bringing your kids with you is not a good idea, there is a very small play area but the rest of the store is full of things they can't touch. Navigating an infant seat or stroller through the store is close to impossible. After today, I won't be selling here again until they come up with a more organized process.

This review is for the car wash only. I have great experiences with the gas station when I stop in once or twice a week after work. However today was my first time getting a car wash at this location. I have just driven a car I purchased home from California. It was sorely in need of some TLC from the drive and the recent monsoon weather. "The Thumb" package seemed the best value as it included interior vacuum, tire pressure check, and a 7 day clean guarantee. The end result was a little disappointing as the trunk was not vacuumed, and the front and grill still had many bugs and spots all over it. I would have been happy to buy an add on if I was aware these areas were not part of the package or required special attention. My bad for not checking the trunk before I left, next time I will do a full walk around with the tech.

Finally decided to check this place out since it's got such a huge following and always seems to be packed full of people. Usually Liberty is our go to in Downtown Gilbert(we cheated this time).  The Bestie and I stopped in for a little day drinking on a Friday afternoon. Glad we came shortly before 4 PM because after it got PACKED. I've had the hankering for a sparkling rose lately so I was happy to see one on the cute wine list clip board. Oh might I mention, $5 ANY glass of wine before 5 PM. Um, yes please. Since we both went with the rose, the server recommended we buy the bottle for the happy hour price of $20. Good deal. We also got a bruschetta board which was just incredible. Four good sized selections that are very easy to split(though you may end up fighting over your favorites). I also noticed that they have a large beer selection as well, something that is lacking at most wine bars. This is a huge plus since the husband is more of a beer drinker. I see a Postino date night in our future.  The atmosphere was fun, the groupings of tables and couches made the space crowded but welcoming, and even with open walls in 90 degree heat it was comfortable and airy. The service was just incredible. Our server was attentive and we had other servers checking on us, refilling water glasses, bringing out food, and just making sure we were having a good time. Both of us have worked in the service industry, a little attention goes a long way. They must have an amazing team over there for everyone to work together so well.  The entire time it was just a shock that there could be somewhere this fun and trendy, on this side of town. I've lived in Gilbert all my life, it's about time downtown gets a little spark back. Plus it's nice to see a new business doing great on this "cursed" corner.  We will definitely be back, with friends to help split a bottle. Looking forward to many warm summer nights on the patio at Postino.

We love this place! Great vibe, amazing beer, and the food was just incredible. We started with the calamari, which is usually pretty standard. Theirs just blew me away it was so yummy. For entrees I got the seared Ahi Tuna, Mom got the baked Mac & Cheese(I gave her grief). Both were perfect. And the price point was pretty amazing a well. The atmosphere is relaxed but still nice, Scottsdale flair without being pretentious. Plenty of TVs inside will make this a great place to be for games,(but still classy enough us ladies will want to come with). And hello, that patio is wonderful, plenty of seating outside and very cool features, can't wait to spend many Arizona summer nights sitting outside enjoying a cold beer.

Never again!  The husband and I flew Allegiant to Oakland, CA a couple weeks ago. Our thought was to give them a chance and save some money. I won't go into the nickle and dime fees mentioned by the other reviewers. Each flight segment cost twice as much as originally advertised in fees alone, without paying to select our seats, for drinks in flight(they even charge for water), and only bringing one bag which we prepaid. We didn't expect much from this airline, and still were blown away by the incompetency of the company and employees. Should have done my research and saved myself the huge headache.  We arrived at the airport 2 hours early for an evening flight since it was our first time flying out of Mesa-Gateway. As soon as we walked in(and stood in the 20 min long line of 5 people), we were informed our flight would be an hour late. Other customers checking in for a flight leaving for Vegas around the same time was told the same thing. No explanation as to why.  We tried to kill some time at one of the two restaurants at the tiny airport. Obviously with two flights delayed everyone had the same idea. When our hour delay was up(now 3 hours of waiting at the airport) We were informed the Vegas flight would be an additional 45 min delayed, and the Oakland flight another hour.  When asked what the cause of the delay was, the agents did not know, and told us they didn't actually work for Allegiant. All they could offer was a piece of paper with the main Allegiant customer service line on it.  After being on hold for a half hour, I finally got through to the rudest customer service agent I've ever experienced. He couldn't offer any explanation on why our flight was delayed, or when we could expect the flight to actually leave. He basically told me that they do not offer any form of compensation for a delay of less than 5 hours, that a 2 hour delay was to be expected and to expect more from them was ridiculous. At that point I just told him I wasn't asking for compensation, all I wanted was just to cancel my reservation for the return trip because we didn't want to experience this again on our way home. He would not even consider allowing me to cancel, he not only wouldn't waive the flight change fee but informed me but we would only receive $0.60 back after taxes and fees. Wow.  When we finally boarded the plane, it was 2.5 hours after the original flight departure time. Surprisingly the flight attendants were nice, though the pilots must be right out of flight school. I've been flying regularly my whole life, that was the most abrupt and frightening take off and landing I've ever experienced. We arrived in Oakland past midnight. Then due to some unforeseen delay(big surprise) bags didn't even start coming out for another hour, after 1 AM. To add insult to injury our brand new suitcase had a busted wheel. Obviously there was no one affiliated with Allegiant around to talk to about it so we were SOL.   We cut our loses and booked a flight back on Southwest. No response from Customer Service regarding our experience. We will never fly Allegiant again, or recommend it to anyone. I can't imagine they have many repeat customers.

I've been visiting European Wax Centers for years and recently followed a great technician to this location. The girls at reception are always friendly and on top of things.  Char is great, makes things as quick and painless as possible.

Oh Youfit, we could have had an amicable break up. I signed up for a membership while the gym was still in construction and never really got a chance to use my membership as it took awhile for them to open and then I got a job on the other side of town with other gym options. I went in and got a relatively pain free cancellation thanks to the fact that I had been paying for 6 months and never been in. Oops. I paid any owed fees and filled out all information to cancel. Nice people and cool place, even if it just wasn't for me at the time. I recommended Youfit to others looking for a gym even after canceling my membership.  Fast forward to a year later. I received a voice mail from a Youfit representative at this location informing me that I was in "collections" for unpaid membership dues but that I could easily pay half of what was owed to be able to use my membership. I called them back and was given another pitch about how easy it would be to bring my membership back into good standing. When I could get a word in, I informed her that I had canceled my membership months prior. She looked up my information, realized that I did indeed have a cancellation form in my file, and put me on hold to talk with a manager. When she came back she apologized and assured me that her and the manager would take care of it, that it was completely a mistake on their part, and that it would not reflect negatively on my credit(as I wasn't actually in "collections"). I thought then that it was taken care of.  A week later, I received a text telling me that my monthly membership due did not process and to call a number to fix my account. I have not received any such texts in the entire year since I canceled, I don't know why this would happen now after it was "taken care of". I again called this location and asked to speak with a manager, the gentleman I spoke with assured me he would be able to help so I again explained the situation to him. He also admitted that my cancellation was on file and I should not still be charged. But he also said that each month's payment since my cancellation in March 2013 has attempted to go through and failed. That is 12 payments that Youfit has attempted to take out of my account, luckily for me the card they have on file is expired and nothing has actually been charged. Again, he assured me that the manager knows my situation and would take care of it with Youfit corporate. I truly hope that is the case however I won't hold my breath.    I can't recommend Youfit anymore, billing issues can happen anywhere, but not catching something like this for 12 months and then not following through to fix a problem is terribly unprofessional. Also, the fact that a manager is not made available and will not personally follow up when there is an issue says a lot about a place.

I grew up eating amazing Thai food at a little place in the Bay Area. Thai iced tea and crystal noodles hold a special place in my heart. That said I really haven't found a Thai place in AZ that I've been crazy about yet. Thai Basil has changed that. We decided to try them on a whim as I had a craving for chicken satay and a menu happened to be in our junk drawer magically. This location is relatively new but Yelp reviews seemed favorable so we gave it a shot. Definitely satisfied the craving and won some Thai food newbies over as well. I agree with the reviewer who said the portions were huge! We ordered 4 orders of chicken satay, a chicken pad thai, and a side of crystal noodles for take out. It was ready in a quick 10 minutes, and was more than enough food for all 5 of us to split. Also ordered two Thai iced teas and our total was still less than $60 with tip(yes, I tip even with take out!).  Was very impressed with the service and the food. The actual dining room seemed a bit informal but probably wouldn't be a terrible place to eat in. Thai Basil offers delivery to my area so my lazy butt might never actually find the need to!

Tonight was the second time we've been to Bourbon Jacks in a week, I think it's safe to say we've found a new favorite. Both Friday night and a weeknight happy hour have great (strong) drinks, awesome music, and incredible service. The whiskey selection is impressive, the beer list had a bit of everything, and the beer cocktails were delicious. The Devil Went Down to Georgia is so good you may need to call a cab. Happy hour drink prices are pretty good and both servers and bartenders are quick with a suggestion if you can't make up your mind. I haven't heard a song I didn't like, though country haters beware, you won't be hearing any top 20 here. It's all country all the time. Love it! Live music every weekend looks like a good time, we left right before it started unfortunately but the place was getting packed so they must be doing something right!  Both visits we ordered food, and it was great! The dinner portions are huge! It's good comfort food and lots of it. Brought home leftovers for the husband and he thought I'd ordered a separate meal just for him (let's just let him keep thinking that).   But what really blew us away about this place is the service. Friday night we had the greatest server, I believe her name was Emily. She was the epitome of a people person. Or as my friend described her, sweet as pie. She had us laughing and having a great time the entire meal and was quick with suggestions. Our drinks were never empty and we never had to wait for a thing. Great servers like that are hard to come by. I sincerely hope the management appreciates what a gem they have in her. Her service alone is what has turned us into future regulars.  For happy hour we sat at the bar and still had great, above and beyond, service. It was an upbeat yet relaxed atmosphere with the vibe of a neighborhood bar yet still friendly to "outsiders". $5 small bites included pretzel bread which was amazing and pulled pork sliders. Perfect for soaking up our happy hour beer cocktail fix.   Can't wait for our next visit, it's great to see Downtown Chandler getting some more bars that are unassuming and don't cost an arm and a leg. Hoping it keeps it's down to earth, small town feel. Now if only Chandler would add some more parking...

A friend told me about this location and we just had to check it out. In terminal 4 near the A gates, we walked over from the southwest side of the terminal, thankfully all the gates are connected once you get through security. We caught breakfast before an early flight. Everything was super fast and efficient, and about as pricey as anything at the airport. Two breakfasts with coffees for $20. For airport food I was pleasantly surprised, just don't expect a typical O&I breakfast. The key to airport restaurants with the high volume and people in a hurry has to be premade and an assembly line. Despite that, it was worth to to have a non fast food breakfast in an upbeat atmosphere.

Great little neighborhood bar. The kind of place where it's easy to become regulars. Any restaurant that just opened it's doors (with a building that took a beating from the previous owners) is going to have it's share of growing pains and kinks to work out. For only being open a week when we ventured in on a Saturday night, we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the diversity of the menu. Drinks priced for a dive bar yet a unique menu of delicious food in Mesa? Yes please. Huge selection of draft beers and quite a few wines. Great staff, managers are on top of things and handle unruly customers very professionally.  For the area, it's a welcome change from choosing between an overpriced chain restaurant or driving to another part of town. Definitely see many happy hours in our future with Taps, looking forward to trying them for brunch. I truly hope they last, we need more thriving local businesses in the area.

Gone are the days you could go into a Coach outlet and find last season's purses you've had your eye on for months. They are definitely making styles that they only sell in the outlets and certain department stores now.You may have to dig through a lot of tacky looking purses to get to something great. While you may find something trendy, you'll end up paying more than what you would have a few years ago. The ironic bit of that is they still do have great sales, but you're getting a discount on a full priced purse. We did have some great finds this trip, and the majority of the staff is super helpful and hilarious. Unfortunately we ended up with a cashier who obviously wished she was still retired. She couldn't answer any of our questions and practically made stuff up when we asked how to clean a certain bag. The manager and head cashier were even standing right there discussing new hire training as the woman struggled to help us. Also, we were buying the bag as a gift and when we asked if it could be wrapped, she just shoved the box into the shopping bag and told us we could do it ourselves. Classy. Most coach stores will wrap up your purchase even if you are buying for yourself. Too much to ask from an outlet I suppose. Next time I need my Coach Outlet fix I'll just wait for a trip through Palm Springs.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Dutch Bros yet, what is wrong with me? Oops sorry guys! When this location opened not long ago we were so excited to have one close by and to see the something new and successful in an area that's gone a bit stale. I'm not ashamed to admit that the first week they were open we made a Dutch Bros trip every single day.  The crew at this location has always been great, always a smiling face and friendly conversation. A little recognition and familiarity goes a long way in my book. I have ordered some strange combinations thanks to dietary restrictions, trying to find something I like, and they always get it right without batting an eyelash.  Recently this crew helped me pull off a fun surprise for my husband, sharing the news that we were expecting. The whole group got into it, making his favorite drink (half sweet iced annihilator) and writing congratulations all over it. It was definitely above and beyond, and I'm so thankful to this awesome group of guys and gals for making a great moment even better.

I'm a big fan of the Fox concepts, so we gave Zinburger multiple tries before deciding it just wasnt going to be the love affair I had hoped. Our first visit, we waited a long time for our food. When it did make it to our table my salad order was wrong and the burger tasted good but the bun was so soggy I just skipped it. The service was good though so we tried again.  The second time was with a group of 10, we called ahead and were told that they don't take reservations on weekends out of consideration for their walk in guests. We were told the wait was an hour so some of us arrived early to put our names in. When we arrived, we were quoted 2 hours. After about an hour there were multiple empty tables including a large table that was sitting empty for 20 minutes. We let the host know again that we were willing to split up. She informed us that the large table sitting empty was for a reservation. So they do take reservations. By the time we put in our orders I had to ask for my food to go because it was over 3 hours before we even got our food. She brought my box then disappeared. It took another 10 minutes before I could find someone to get me a check so I could leave. There are better options in Downtown Gilbert if we feel like braving the weekend crowds again.
