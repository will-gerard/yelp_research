The Il Purista sandwich has become a staple of my life. Mozzarella, basil, prosciutto, roasted red peppers and balsamic vinaigrette blend into a front runner for the best sandwich in the valley. Goes great with sparkling water or a beer.   DeFalco's also has other Italian fare such as a delicious meatball sub and classic pastas.

I had the Pad-Thai which was fantastic. The noodles were perfectly done, and the sauce was tangy with a wonderful amount of spice. I was really happy with the amount of food I got for the price as well.   I also recommend the angel wing appetizer. It can be described as a "Thai chicken nugget" very yummy with their sweet sauce.

The dolsot bimbibap was spectacular. The dish my vegetarian girlfriend ordered received great reviews from her as well. We also enjoyed their selection of Korean Imports for drinks.   My only critique was that it seemed understaffed. The service was good, but there was only one man for about 5 tables. I enjoyed the food however and encourage people to visit. The waiter spent time explaining dishes to us which was appreciated.

Nice beer selection, good cocktails, and good burgers. The build your own Mac and Cheese is a great idea and tastes great. Good local place to watch football as well.   Our server Justin was really nice and attentive. The service was excellent. I've come a few times for late drinks and it's been a good time.

I'll begin by saying, I've never been inside the Handlebar Tempe. I'll follow that up by saying, I have absolutely no desire to, after they way I was yelled at by one of their bounce staff. Now, I know bouncers have to deal with a lot of drunks, and it is probably a frustrating job. However, I was sober, not even in line for the Handlebar, and waiting for a friend, on the sidewalk, well away from the front door. Without provocation, or really for any reason, I was yelled at by a redheaded bouncer to get in line. I informed him I was waiting for a friend, and was confused because I was literally waiting on the curb. He started shouting that I needed to be in line, and that he doesn't take bribes, and if I wasn't going to get in line, I needed to get out of his sight.   Now, a) the sidewalk is a public sidewalk and is in no way owned by Handlebar, b) the way he approached the situation was incredibly rude, arrogant, and made him look like an ass.  Maybe the guy was having a rough day, I don't know. Regardless, his behavior was enough for me to post a review about it. So, if the management of the Handlebar Tempe happens to see this, I'd recommend encouraging your security staff to have a little more tact and not yell at people minding their own business.

Great beer selection and a much more courteous staff. Had a good time! The bartenders were very knowledgable and had great ideas based on your taste preferences. I'm an IPA fan, and they gave me quite a few new beers to try.

Great service, wonderful food and a great draft selection. I was ecstatic to find an upscale pub so close to home. Their ingredients are usually local, and their bartenders know what they are talking about. Fantastic experience.
