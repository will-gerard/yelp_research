The first time we ate a Claim Jumpers we loved it. Great food and service in the dinning room was awesome, however it's been down hill ever since. We use to go about 2-3 time a week for happy hour but stopped because the service was so horrible. The bartenders are so unfriendly and the staff in the bar area are rude. It's been about a month since we have been back and we decided to give it another chance today. Walk into the bar area for happy hour and there is a bartender and a server and only 2 people sitting in the whole area .... And it still took them over 5 minutes to come over and give us menus. When the server (Taylor) finally did come over all she said is what do you want to drink..... I'm in the service industry, if my manager EVER heard me great a table like that I would be written up immediately not to mention it's just rude. We got a couple of drinks and appetizers. Once she brought out the food the was the last time we saw her for over 15 minutes, we needed boxes and we're ready to go and her and the bartender were just standing there on their phones talking. I had to get up from the table and walk over to ask her to come to the table because we needed to leave. I love the food here, and we have always had pretty good service in the dining area but the girls that work at the bar are HORRIBLE and insanely rude. Don't think we will be going to CJ ever again.

So this review is not for the food but for the customer service. Today I went in during lunch and of course there was a long line for lunch. There was someone taking orders for sandwiches and soups and when we got up to him, no greeting just 'What can I get for you'. We wanted a smoothie and a muffin so we were directed to another line. After waiting in a second line it's finally our turn to order and the girl at the register just stares at us. No hello, no what can I get for you, nothing. So I order and iced coffee and a muffin. She throws the cup up on the counter and goes and grabs my muffin. I then ask her where do I go to get my ice coffee, she doesn't even look up from the register and just points across the way to a drink station and says $4.58. Ok. Fine. I'm over it that yall aren't in a good mood but the icing on the cake was when I asked another employee who was clearing off a table where the restrooms were. He didn't look up from the table and just pointed to the back of the store ..... Collectively worst customer service I have experienced in a VERY long time.

Sooooo upset. Went with my family to Vegas for my dad's 60th birthday. He is a HUGE fan of Criss Angel. Has all his DVD, merchandise, totally loves this guy and is a 100% a believer. So as a surprise we take him to Vegas, stay at the Luxor and of course get 2nd row seats (which cost $658 for 4 tickets) to see Criss Angels show. The show is full of lame sexual jokes (and I'm all for a good sexual pun), half assed magic tricks and basically criss telling us about his life and show. Could get all that info he spent 1/2 the show talking about on Wikipideia  If your a fan of Criss Angel and have seen his DVD DO NOT SEE HIS SHOW. It will totally ruin him for you. It was pretty upsetting seeing how disappointed my dad was after. Not to mention this was the first show I've ever seen in Vegas. Honestly, best part of the show was the super hot stage manger.

Love the food selections here. I almost always get the Mediterranean antipasto plater. It has a little bit of everything and is super delicious. Good atmosphere. Also got a dessert for the first time (carrot cake) and it was bomb.

Delicious food and great happy hour. We got the express lunch with a 10 inch pizza (Chicken Parm) and a Cesar salad and it was soooo good. And we got sangrias off happy hour for 5 dollars. Service and food was awesome. We will definitely be back.

Super cute interior. Always very clean and professional. Heather is awesome! She always does such a great job and makes the waxing process very comfortable.
