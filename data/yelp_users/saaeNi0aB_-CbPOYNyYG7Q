Don't bother with this place unless you have a big order that will make them money. I just needed some labels for a growler. I was never called back, emailed, nothing. They completely forgot about me.

I love this spot. There is an awesome living social deal going on right now too. The seasonal pale ale they have right now is amazing. The wings are so good. I got the honey hot. I'm going back again this week. I am also considering having my next birthday in the adjacent brew house.

Awesome staff, awesome beers. Food and drinks are a little pricey but thats what you have to pay for for selection.

I wish I could give this 0 stars. I met up a girl here to have a Guinness. I had one, she had one. I order her a shot. The bartender said she couldn't serve us anymore because she put her head on my shoulder. Yeah, cuz it was 1 in the morning on a monday and she was tired. She called security and he escalated the situation and then the police were called. Over a shot. I hope this place catches on fire. I am embarrassed that Guinness is served here. Not only that, the bartenders don't even properly pour it.

This place looks awesome. What they have done to this dusty building is amazing. I love the vintage look and the decorations. The bad... $4.50 for a PBR? At happy hour? Are you kidding? I'm no beer snob but I like an ipa or even a pale ale. Nowhere to be found. They only had these old Milwaukee beers. I mean that's cool if you're going with the theme but have more beer maybe? A pint of Santan epicenter was $6.50. No thanks. I'm outta here.
