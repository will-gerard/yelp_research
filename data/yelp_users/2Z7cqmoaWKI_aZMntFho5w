Against the advice of my 21 year old the family ventured out to see "Killers" at Farrelli's Cinema and Supper Club in Scottsdale.   Farrelli's is a place I frequent on a special night for a movie that I wished I would have caught at the theatre.   The unique twist with Farrelli's is the dining and drinking you can do while you are watching the show. The movies range throughout the day from great family movies and the heavier stuff at night when the kids should be in bed.  The wine list  and other beverages along with the food are above average quality and price. Anywhere I can find a glass of Row 11 Pinot is alright with me.  My family usually shy's away from the high dollar menu and stick to the salads appi's and the tenderloin sandwich. My 12 year old decided the pizza has been too mushy in the past so he opted for the tenderloin sandwich as well this time.  I had a cold crispy lettuce wedge that was drowned in dressing but oh so good. My fault for not getting the dressing on the side. I do not understand why 99% of the restaurants I go to insist on drowning the lettuce!  My daughter had the chicken ceasar and a Blue Moon and actually laughed at the silly movie. Just goes to show how much the environment weighs in on forming an opinion.  Farrelli's is a family run business and seems to be hanging in there in this economy. I wish they had a few less expensive options but we always order the same thing.  There is a nice bar to wait in until seating time and very comfortable rolling chairs to actually view the movie. Plus great music videos before the show.  The bartender is always happy and friendly, but our waiter Kieth seemed a bit put off that we already had drinks when we got to the table and never has as nice  table side manor. Everyone else at Farrelli's has always been very nice and "happy".  Make sure you get the popcorn!!!! It is just like Grandma used to make in the popcorn popper. Only the best ingredients.  I am getting a group of ladies together next week to go in and catch Sex and the City 2 with a donation of a pair of shoes you get a $2 martini!  Farrelli's is a great place for gatherings of all ages and occasions.   I tell all my friends to go there when they want to do something different.  Farrelli's is a go!

Just a quick note about the North Course for all of the people coming to Scottsdale this spring.  Talking Stick was a very well managed beautiful course. I would give the course 5 stars!   The condition of the course was fabulous. The greens were playing true and tight. User friendly for the not so "target golfer". Not too much water , desert, or sand. The cart girl made the rounds in ample time. The ranger was hoovering for no good reason. We paced out at 4:15. If they did not make the cart options on a few holes so confusing we may have been faster.  We paid $80 per round, but I hear the rates during spring training are going to be around $179 for visitors (cheaper than a room at $159). If you like this style course I would check the prices at Orangetree Golf Course, similar style and great shape!  I would skip the lunch and just have a draft beer. The food was not good and the bottled beer was not very cold.

Best yogurt! Great Value!  I hate buying more food than I want! It is all in your hands at YogurtBuilderZ.   The yogurt is very good and the toppings are always fresh.   Expect a line.  Just GO!

We dined at Orange Sky last Saturday and the place was packed! The casino was full and so was the restaurant.  We had a party of 11 and were not so lucky to get a super long table from tip to tail. Use the potty before you sit down in the large comfy chairs because backing them up for a break can be interesting.  The service seemed great at first and then went progressively downhill. The servers should probably learn how to do magic tricks and make balloon animals to entertain the customers while they are waiting and waiting and waiting.  The restaurant was out of lobster for a 7PM seating and after 3 people ordered oysters they came back to say they were out of those as well.  The crab Louie salad had an odd flavor to the dressing and 3 unexplainable crustini's that you couldn't cut or pick up.  Tough and slow seemed to be the buzz words at the table. I had the pork chop and it was so dry I felt like I could blow dust out of my mouth while trying to muster up enough saliva to swallow it.  Everyone that ordered steak said they were tough and overdone. The beef comes from Arkansas.  The asparagus was the size of my big toe and was recommended over the brocolini.  They graced our birthday boy and girl with a fabulous chocolate mousse desert which was very good. As we all stared and shared they came back 10 minutes later to see if anyone else wanted desert, but the chocolate mousse was not an option.  When the one dreaded desert order was taken I ordered a hot tea which had at least a half of a cup of tea leaves in a two cup pitcher. Can you say, "tea buzzzz"?  Maybe they need to read some of these reviews as these seem to be common complaints.  The venue is very very nice and I think you know what I think about the rest.

The latest spot in Scottsdale's Kierland ~ Scottsdale Quarter area. Primebar is quickly pulling patrons from the HOT , HOT, HOT Blue Martini at City North.    I am a fan of the location of  Primebar as well as the food and prices. I am usually all about the Happy Hour. Primebar has reasonable Happy hour pricing as well as premium drink choices and quality food  We sampled the Pomegranate Martini ~ The Silly Goose ~ Margarita ~ Beer. $6 Martinis (using  top shelf +FRESH ingredients) and $3 Drafts quality from Stella, Local Four Peaks Brew, and Bud Light. The temperature and the taste were right on target for a 100+ degree Friday when we walked in. The Margarita ~ a little on the dry side , but fresh ~ Pomegranate Martini slightly sweet, cool , fresh, and had people fighting over my blueberries! Silly Goose also yummy! A little more of a citrus (grapefruit side) tart, but fresh and yummy.  The appi's that hit our table were the Steak Quesadilla ~ Calamari ~ Pulled Pork Sliders ~ and the Roasted Pepper Hummus.  We skipped the Deviled Eggs although I was curious. All for $5 each and the servings were plentiful enough for 2 or more people..  The Steak Quesadilla used very very thin slices of steak melted cheese on the inside, crispy and dry on the outside (not mushy) with a kick sauce on top, and disappeared quickly. I was too full for the pulled pork but they were overstuffed sliders only 3 to a plate but big enough to cut in half and share.  Next came the Calamari. I was not a big fan , but I have lived on Calamari on trips to Asia so it is hard to match in the US. Primebar fell a little short. It was crispy but also very oily. Everyone liked the sauces ( because they were American style) Tartar sauce and cocktail sauce! The coating was like Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. I bet Primebar can improve this dish to come up to the standards of the rest of the menu.  I am so tired of Hummus! Someone else had to try it and I must say that it was the best I have given in to in a long time. The presentations, texture and taste  were all 5 stars in my book.  I really like the flexibility of the space at Primebar and hope I can make it back after Happy Hour sometime to listen to the "live" music. An early tease may have kept me there!  Definitely GO! It is worth a trip for some quality fair and let me know how you liked it if you STAY!

Even though Eddie Vs does not do happy hour on the cheap cheap you end up with the finest foods on your plate. Currently the discount is $ 2 off all drinks and $ 3 off all appetizers. The large finely crafted oval walnut bar anchors the lounge area flanked by intimate tables for open viewing enjoyment of the nightly live jazz sounds that Eddie Vs is known for.  Appetizers like Tartare of Ahi Tuna, Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, Crispy Oysters (do not shy away from the curry), Maine Lobster Tacos, and Point Judith Calamari are all favorites. Serving sizes are enough to share between two or three people. The drink menu is extensive as well as the premium  wine list.

Most of all you don't want to miss the truffle mac and cheese that leaves you thinking about when you are going to be able to go back for more. Don't be afraid of the fresh beets! They are not the kind we grew up looking at as a kid. These are some premium root vegetables prepared to enhance any plate.  As with all of the restaurants envisioned by Guy Villavaso and Larry Foles ( the father of U of A quarterback Nick) you will never be disappointed with the highly skilled staffs commitment to the quality of your dining experience. The depth of the staff's education on product and service is impeccable!   I hope you look forward to your next trip back as much as I do.
