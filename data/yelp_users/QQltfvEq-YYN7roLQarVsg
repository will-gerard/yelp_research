Love love love the Biltmore! By far my favorite macy's ever! Because they have more upscale merchandise but the same sales as every other macy's. I have found some amazing shoe deals here! I also enjoy the set up and browsing through the stuff I can't afford.  Great place to take out of towners to walk around in December and make them jealous. And around Christmas time they have snow machines!

This place is a good escape in the Scottsdale scene. It feels like Rocky Point spring break but super upgraded! There is no better place to sip a Corona then at Dos Gringos without a passport, at least.

Okay so update! I'm never giving any of my money to dos ever again after a less than desirable encounter with the bouncers.    Gotta do the only thing I can, let my money do the talking. I will enjoy a corona in a more friendly atmosphere. Maybe loco patron?

I really like the atmosphere of Suede. On New Year's Eve I was suckered into that three club pass for Suede, Myst and Axis/Radius. I would have been perfectly happy spending all night at Suede. I think that place is laid back and high energy, depending on what you want to do. You can dance or you can lounge. The bartender gave my friends and me a free shot, which was awesome.   I'll def go back when I get the chance.

I have only been there once for like 20 minutes. First off the door man was really rude and just gave me the "what are you dumb" look because it was my first time there and I didn't really understand their door procedure. As if it's easy to figure out anywhere on which side of like 12 red ropes are the appropriate ones.   The crowd seemed kind of dead to me when I was there. They were playing awesome music though. Nobody was dancing. Oh well, I guess you don't do that at Six. But what am I supposed to do? I can't sit down and I'm not one to just stand and stare really.   I might have stayed a little while longer if my friends weren't so over it. Maybe next time? Not sure if there will be a next time.

OMG I love Drift! I went here a whim the first time but now I always try to make it the pre-club stop when I'm in Old Town. I just really love the laid back vibe of the place and the drinks are fun. I have once carried out their giant clam shell drink onto the patio and sipped on it with six close friends. I would never do it again, but sometimes you just want to share a 36 dollar concoction.   Come here if you actually want to talk to some of the people you decided to venture out into the night scene with.

I've been here once and had a pretty good time in the Shaker Room. But it was disgusting and hot in there.   SO not worth paying any sort of cover... ever

I love this place! The pizza is so good and it never disappoints. I went to school down in Tucson and they just opened one near Arizona stadium, I screamed when I saw the sign for the one in Tucson I was so excited. Now I can have it whenever I want in Phoenix and Tucson!   The sauce is great so is the cheese and I always get pepperoni, which is awesome as well!  I also really like the croutons in the Caesar salad!

I really enjoyed AZ88. First off, my friends and I had an amazing bartender that kept giving us remnants of every drink he was making and even made one special for us! The chicken sandwich I had was great, with jalapenos and honey and the fries were perfect! And I really loved the atmosphere. And the bathrooms are worth checking out. They are a great conversation piece.   I'll make my way back to AZ88!

I have been to The Greene House twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times I enjoyed the experience.  First I went there for lunch with a friend. We sat out on the outdoor seating  to enjoy some of the perfect Arizona weather. Our waiter was very attentive and prompt. I ordered the twin kobe burgers. I thought they were done perfectly to my medium specifications and just the right amount of food. Now I am a "picker" when it comes to eating so two little burgers are plenty for me, but for others they may feel hungry afterwards.   The next time I went for dinner with my parents on a Saturday night. The restaurant was pretty packed and the wait about 25 minutes. The bartenders were very accommodating as were the hostesses. I guess you can give them your cell phone number and they will call you when your table is ready, so you can go around and shop if you want to. I think that is a nice touch.  Well, we were finally seated. The service was prompt and attentive. For my meal I had the crispy half chicken. I thought it was very good and the marscapone cream corn was an interesting side. Definitely different and out of the ordinary.   All and all two great meals for lunch and dinner. My dad barely complained when he was there, he loved his food, and that is saying a lot for an establishment. ha.

Went here with a friend. The atmosphere is cute, but there was light flashing in my eyes my whole meal since we were seated in the front of the screen for some sort of video art project.   Food was pretty good, pomegranate margarita, even better.  I'll be back.

I don't like this place. Was here on New Year's Eve after several drinks and still did not think it was cool. The place is a mess. Overcrowded with the wrong type of crowd. It's just not a place I ever want to be and would never go on my own free will ever again.

Pink Taco is just mediocre. Plain and simple. I was at  the one in Vegas first and it was a pretty good time and the food was acceptable.  Contrary to what everyone else is saying I thought the service was fine.  Don't waste your time at Pink Taco.

Blah I am  not a fan this place. I have been here like four times and have never been impressed. The place is really cool looking inside, but most of the time the crowd is just weird.   I don't get you e4, decide what you want to be? I think the room themes are almost working against this place.

It's just okay. It's a fun place to dance but I think sometimes the DJs get a little too carried away with DJing. I would like to hear songs not mash-ups on your Apple laptop. Is that all takes to be a DJ now? An Apple laptop? Anyways, it's not worth the cover and I think there are a lot of better places to take your ten dollars.

I went here for happy hour with a long time friend. I wanted to try something new and Switch totally fit the bill.  First off, their happy hour is A-mazing! I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect.   My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better.  For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day.   The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!

I love this place I don't care what anybody says!  I always have fun here and most of the times I've gone I've been sober! Yep sober! I think the music is fun and I like that dark "you never know what anybody really looks like" atmosphere. The bartenders are great and frequently will give you free shots!  Oh Dirty Pretty, you and I will always be friends, no matter what anyone says.

I went to the North in Tucson once for a birthday party and was not impressed by what I got for the price. Well a trip to this one completely changed my mind about the modern Italian restaurant.   I met a friend at North on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy so we put our name in for a table. However, we quickly snagged two seats at the bar which were just perfect.  We decided to just go ahead and eat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and made the experience great. My friend and I quickly ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share. The Sangria was delish, and I think a pretty good deal.   After perusing the menu we both settled on the baked ziti. At 16 dollars I was hoping I was going to get my money's worth. It was so yummy. My friend also really enjoyed her ziti as well. I left North feeling like I got a top notch dining experience. I'm so glad I gave it another chance. Based on the food and service, this is a great restaurant.

Awesome Happy hour + Chambord margs = even more awesomeness!  I love this place. Even full price their amazing margaritas are still a bargain. But go for happy hour, regular or reverse, it's the best!  Southwest Caesar is aces, so is the mac and cheese!

I have to say I used to be really scared of Indian food. No longer!  My first time with Indian food was definitely a pleasant one. I thought the food was very good and not too spicy.   And right now they are doing this Golden dollar campaign where they give you a dollar for coming to the restaurant because they think that is the amount of gas money you spent getting there.   How nice and conscientious of you Bombay Spice!

Looking at the star rating for this place I was shocked. I love Blanco! It's one of my favorite Fox Restaurant Concepts. They have fabulous house margaritas and tons of beers to choose from. I recommend the carne asada tacos, they are consistently good. The rice there is awesome. Blanco is always a go to place for good food and good atmosphere.

MOJO yogurt is just fab! Love the flavors, love the toppings, love that it is all self serve.  The only thing I don't love are the giant cups! It always makes me buy too much! And then eat it.   My favorite flavor so far is the cookie and the mint one.

I thought Culinary Dropout was a great experience. I met a friend here for dinner on a Saturday night. We decided to sit at the bar outside because the place was pretty busy.   Eating at the bar was pleasurable. My friend and I became completely enthralled with this what seemed to be whipped cream the bartender was making. Turns out it was actually pomegranate foam to top off one of their cocktails. the clown punch. Since I am always down for anything pomegranate I just had to have it. Excellent cocktail! I totally recommend it!  My friend and I decided to split the fish and chips and a burger. Both were very good. Burger was good, but nothing too memorable. The fish and chips were awesome! I totally would order it again.  What a great space with a great menu, staff and atmosphere. Way better use of the space than stupid Pink Taco.

Now I have never actually eaten at Stingray sushi for full price. I always go there for their incredible happy hour. Their happy hour goes from 3-7 with all of their specialty drinks on special as well as a bevvy of apps and sushi. My go to cocktail always seems to be a Skyy ginger vodka and soda. I have tried all of the specialty drink and I always go back to the Geisha a Go Go, Asian Blonde, and Kiwi Collins.  As far as food goes, I keep coming back again and again for the awesome spring rolls, and spicy tuna rolls.  I love the atmosphere of Stingray, I always get excellent service. Perfect place for an upscale happy hour!

I think ZinBurger is absolutely fantastic! I have been there twice. Once on a Monday night and then again on a Sunday night.  The hostesses are very helpful and polite. They let you know exactly what is going on with tables and get you seated as soon as possible.  Both waiters I had were pretty good. One was extremely helpful and accommodating. The other was just okay, not bad, but nothing to write home about.   Let's get to the food! OMG the burgers are amazing! I have had the Kobe burger and the Zin burger. I thought both were equally good. I could not tell much of a difference between them. Zinburger actually cooks a burger medium if you ask them to! Sometimes it seems some places ask you your preference and still cook it well done. Not Zinburger.   I had the handcut fries which were pretty good. Have not had a chance to try any of the others.  The Double Chocolate Mint Shake is to die for!  Best burger I have had in awhile! Will be going back asap!

OMG OMG OMG! Beckett's table is an amazing addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene. I have enjoyed two meals here and both were equally amazing.   The true test for any restaurant in my family is if we take my father there and he does not complain. My second outing to Beckett's Table was with my dad and he did not complain a single time. That my friends is when you know it's good.   I have not been very adventurous during my two times dining here, I ordered the exact same thing each time, with dessert for me always being a toss up.  The Beckett's original grilled cheese with that delicious tomato soup is absolutely amazing. The savory soup coupled with a grown up kid classic is a divine way to start a decadent evening meal. The short ribs were absolutely amazing. They are what carnivore dreams are made of. As if it could not get any better, then there is dessert. And as a person who always looks at a dessert menu first to decide if I want to save room, SAVE ROOM! I have had the chocolate dipped bacon 'smores and the death by chocolate. Both are amazing, but the death by chocolate is by far my favorite. HELLO NUTELLA PUDDING! I swear I still have dreams about it.   I appreciate the GF options, I'm always on the lookout for places that can accommodate my little celiac sis.   One more thing to note: Parking is an absolute nightmare in this lot, I would suggest parking towards the other end of the shopping center and walking up to Beckett's.

Citizen Public House is my go to place for an amazing bite to eat and excellent service. I have been to CPH at least 6 or more times and every time I am never disappointed.   CPH is comfort food taken to the next level. Whether you order the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn (don't fear it, it's awesome) or the chicken and waffles, taste bud satisfaction is the norm at this place.   I think the reason I keep coming back, despite the excellent food and amazing white sangria is the amazing service. Whether it's a busy Saturday night, or an early dinner on a weekday I am continually impressed with their level of knowledge and service at CPH. It's how a restaurant experience should be, and it's consistently amazing, just like the food. A plus also is they offer Gluten-Free options for my celiac sister. Believe me she is very hard to please, but CPH always puts her at ease when it comes to the GF options. Go to CPH and I promise you will not be disappointed.  What I love to order: white sangria, original chopped salad, pan seared scallops

I don't understand why people wait for this lousy pizza.  Ordered half mushoom/pepperoni.  I swear the mushrooms were from a can and hardly any pepperoni.  I personally have eaten better pizza from a box.  It used to be better , but not anymore.  I have banned this restaurant.

Sam Fox, you always seem to have a beeline directly to my  wannabe foodie heart.  I came to the New North as I call it just four days after it opened. Usually you think brand new restaurant they are probably still ironing out the kinks right? You must not know Sam Fox like I know him. This man has a knack for turning mediocrity into excellence. I mean the space used to be a car wash! A CAR WASH! Only Fox vision could turn a car wash into  an amazing addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene.   The restaurant is officially called North Fattoria Italiana, which I will tell you was confusing at first. When your friend calls you and says "Want to go to North, it's the new Sam Fox restaurant?" "You mean the one at Kierland? That's not new." "No not that one a new one." HUH??  I decided to stop asking questions and just go. Our waitress informed us that Mr. Fox is probably going to take all of his North locations in this more casual direction.   I started my experience with the Julietta cocktail. Super awesome and girly, I love any cocktail with bubbles. Plus the cocktail looks like an accessory to your already cute outfit.   The menu is a neighborhood Italian vibe. Pizza, pasta, antipasti. Of course, there is the Sam Fox flair. I shared the margherita pizza, which was very good and the ricotta gnocchi. Both were stellar. The gnocchi is not a traditional potato gnocchi, but it was very good.   Of course I finished off my meal with dessert. Since, nutella to me is as good as gold I ordered the "affogato", and it was a great end to an overall great meal and experience.   A plus was that our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. Always nice to have good service when you are spending your hard earned cash. I can't wait to go back and give New North another spin.  Touche Sam Fox, touche.

I went to Vanity after buying a groupon for a blowout. I believe my blowout was with Ariella. I have bought a lot of groupons for blowouts in the past, and I think this will be the first time I will come back sans groupon. The salon itself is really pretty. There are tvs, magazines galore. What is making me book a second appointment is how well my hair turned out. My hair usually never holds curl....NEVER! After my blowout with Ariella my hair held curl for two days! I am so impressed. I'll be back again.
