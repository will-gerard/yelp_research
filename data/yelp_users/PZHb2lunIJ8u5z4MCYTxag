I was so excited that I was able to get my windows in my new car before the heat of the summer. They were very timely and had a great guest waiting area with free wifi. I thought I would be there for 2 hours, so I brought work to do. I wasn't able to finish my work because they were done much faster! They had great instructions for me to do after. At first I thought there were small bubbles in the window but I waited the time frame they suggested and everything was perfect. They assured me if there were any problems they would take care of it. I certainly would recommend them to anyone wanting there windows tinted.

Absolutely the worst pedicure I have ever had. I totally have wasted my money. My husband could do a better job. No wonder the place had no other customers. I should have just left. The equipment is old and outdated. The nail tech didn't seem to know what she was doing. If I could give it no stars I would. Never coming back. I should have looked at the dates of posts. This was a total waste of money.

Love this place. Great trainers! I love the location and everyone is friendly and it is very clean. I do wish the women's bathrooms were bigger, but it seems all the locations have small women's bathrooms. Love the workout!
