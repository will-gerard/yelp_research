Looks like it was recently remodeled. I ordered the grand slams $8.00 and the waitress was nice enough to tell me about the $3.99 grand slam specials. Saved me money. Food was fresh and good. Fluffy pancakes and eggs. So good that I went back a second time. Waitresses were nice also. I had good experience both times 8/23 and 8/24.

I have frequently been to this location because it is close to my home. I normally spend any where from $15-25 a trip because of my family size. I had a horrible customer service experience with Ebony (Manager) and June (cashier). I reported to Lisa the area manager via email and she apologized and said that she would leave a gift card for me. The receipt number I complained about was provided to her so she could confirm the people that handled my meal. The total on the receipt was $21+. She left a $10 gift card. Needless to say, I will not be spending my hard earned money there anymore.   OAN: Brandon (another manager) is awesome and was the only reason why I went to that location in the first place.  Beware: Even the area manager doesn't know how to resolve customer complaints.

Looked this place up before making appointment, April did a great job. I had to wait a while even with an appointment but they apologized and serviced me and my daughter to our satisfaction. Their hot stone massage was great and you get a full foot and calf massage as part of the $20. Great price, good service.  OAN: It was a little dusty in there. They may want to look into remodeling, but not if that is going to increase the prices. ;-)

Had a short cut wig that was human hair on sale, set me up for coupons (saved $2), and even ordered more natural ebony hair ponytails and puffs after I told them that myself and other black people would buy. The staff is also very nice and helpful. They may want to consider adding another person for busy times of the day.

The owner seems to be a nice guy, however there are definitely things that need to be addressed ASAP. See below...  Atmosphere- 4 stars ( sports fans, nice tv's, Chicago Games. )  Service- 1 star (Horrible and they are not prepared for game day crowds.)  Food- 2 stars ( With the Chicago theme, I was hoping for better and they had small portions for the high prices. Disappointed!)  Management- 1 star (Had an incident and they did not have any urgency to resolve. Did not follow up with me and did not offer to comp my meal. Acted like they did me a favor by comping $9.89 Chi-fries appetizer. Don't want to go into too many details, but make sure you check your glasses for chips because they served me a lemonade with glass shards in it. Needless to say that I will not be returning!)

I always forget to post a review. I love their pear mojito and vodka drink (can't remember the name). Followed by Lettuce Wraps and Crispy Green Beans. Then. Honey Crisp, Sesame, or Orange chicken with chicken fried rice.  Any dessert will do. They are all yummy!

This location is the best in my area. No wait and the best cheese or pep for the price. It tastes like the use real mozzarella. Their cheese is stretchy. Delicious!

Had a #4 lunch special with 2 slices and drink for $4.33 including tax. The slices were so hood I took my daughters back and got them their own specials also. Thumbs up from this family! I wish they had sweetened tea as a beverage though.

I go every half off Saturday! I find great things, but they don't really have any plus size clothes. Other than that, I've found tons of things that I needed to settle in after relocating from another city.  Kinda dusty and the normal thrift store smell, but you expect that from these types of stores.

Very attentive and nice! I took my 5 and 13 year old girls for a Mommy/daughter date and we were all very pleased. Mike did a great job without direction, he knew exactly how I wanted my Gel French Tip Manicure. No lines, no waiting! I was worried at first because they had no business, but now business is starting to pick up, so I guess I was just one of the first customers.
