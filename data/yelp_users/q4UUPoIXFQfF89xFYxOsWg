I was researching a spot for a large group for brunch and decided to stop in for lunch to check it out.  I had the best pulled chicken sandwich ever!   It was served on a cutting board with homemade potatoe chips.  Kayleen my waitress was wonderful and the  love the chic friendly atmosphere.  A great find!  I will be returning with our large group for sure!

I have eaten here many times during the week and the food is excellent.  On the weekend, we waited over an hour to be seated.  They were very short staffed and didn't have busers to turn the tables quickly.  Owner was busing tables and informed us two staff did not show today.  Disappointed.
