My girlfriend from outta town suggested we have dinner here last week.   The mansion & it's history is what I really loved about it. We walked around and peeked in all the rooms before we ate. Kinda has a spooky vibe- heard it was haunted!   Service for dinner was great! The food was just okay, I had the Filet and it was just so-so. I would not order a steak there again. We decided to indulge in caviar- pricey but yummy!   We sat outside and the views were amazing. We even saw fireworks coming from a baseball game ?  I will be back for Sunday Brunch- heard that's their specialty! Bottomless mimosas & lots of seafood ! I'll update once I am able to go!

This review is mostly to give props to how clean and great the restrooms and food court are !  All malls need to take a look how beautiful the restrooms are . The cleanest I have ever seen ( even my bathrooms lol )  All staff in food court are way friendly !  I was not too pleased on stores. Nothing was extra special .   But if u need a snack or a quick restroom stop - this is the place to go before you head up north !

Just received cold pizza and under cooked bread sticks. When we called to let them know we were disappointed , reply was " well that doesn't make sense"   Also we requested red pepper flakes- and when we mentioned on the phone to the same guy , his reply " we loose money sending them with pizza"    We will be going on Howiedoing.com to give another complaint.   Our office will not call or order from you again!

Was in the neighborhood , had to check out!  Great samples of pork. Looked like really good bacon to buy!   Staff were friendly and hard working.

Great fast clean taco shop!  I have been coming here for years when I just want greasy carbs! They are always fast, to the the point and very delicious!  Sometimes it does get crowded but the wait is never too long. Everyone in the neighborhood is a fan I swear!   Much much better than any Filiberto's!! Or any bertos' !!

This has to be my favorite sushi restaurant! All sushi is very fresh and huge portions.  The one thing is does lack is great servers- they seem to always forget something . But, management does pick up the slack ! Which you can not say for a lot of places. The manager always seem to be very helpful, hopefully she can teach her staff :)  Get there early, restaurant is not very big and fills up quick!   Highly suggest this place to everyone I know- the quality is top notch !

I look forward to picking up my mail here!  Yes I have my normal mail box at home but needed this place for safe packages and  extra secure mail . Jay is a wonderful person. He calls when I have a package delivered . I refer all friends and family here for anything they might need . You will not find a better place !   Jay has been more than helpful helping me with huge boxes to my car - he goes the extra mile ! just come here ; you will see for yourself! Can't say enough great things ! :)

First time here, why didn't I come sooner?!  Both my malteses look great. They are extra soft now!  I really like how open the grooming room is - very clean! I was shocked to see no clutter or ounce of dirt!  Both dogs were done on time - which I am not not use to.  First time visit- 10% off on yelp check in!     Convenient, easy and friendly service!

Great overall experience!   I have been meaning to check out this salon for awhile now- I had Lindsay do my hair and I am glad I did! She's very sweet & listened to what I wanted! Been trying to achieve a ombré hair color for the past few months and I finally have it!   I will most def be back- very laid back rock star vibe and very cold fat tire beer in frosty ice cold mugs! Yum!  Thank you again Lindsay!

Bought the couch of our dreams!  If you want a Quality couch and are ready to spend some cash- this is the place to do it at. Yes , lazboy isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for. I expect our brand new sectional couch to last us a very long time.  Lori was our sales person, she's very nice and not pushy. She made the shopping experience very relax and not stressful. Delivery was on time and on point.    I'm sure we will be back!

What a nice store! Nice change from grumpy Frys employees by me lol  Had a lovely time shopping today at this location. Got some great products, food and treats!   All the staff is very helpful, genuinely happy and know their stuff! Yes, it is more expensive to shop here, but such a sweet staff to make a awesome experience!   The bakery, cheese area & vitamin area all helped me today. Kudos to them! :)  I also love coming here for lunch. The sandwich & sushi are great choices.   Even the check out line, the cashier and bagger were happy and nice! They must treat their employees great here!!   Kinda makes me wanna get a part time job here to be happy with everyone! Happy dance! Lol :)

I get it, it's retail . Staff wants to look their best and be posh at fashion square mall.. We all get it.  Dressing attendant was beyond clueless and did not want to help find sizes. Cashiers did not take off censors for my clothing and other customers . All items were dropped numerous times.  Shopping is suppose to be fun and relaxing for most. Not here! Frantic skittish and stuck up staff- yikes. I'll try to find another location asap!

It's not a mall trip without going to Kona's happy hour! I always feel like my shopping is a success after happy hour here.  Today the service was great, waitress was really attentive & nice, I did not catch her name :/   Food was good, had sushi rolls and a couple appetizers. Chicken satay & avocado rolls are a must try!  I personally think the dining room is way too bright & might be scaring off customers. But I always sit outside staring at the valet area lol. Margaritas are much better next door but you can't win them all!

Very comfortable yummy restaurant.   The bar is super comfortable with a outdoor patio and indoor bar with some nice almost too comfortable couches! The happy hour is great, my boyfriend loves the chilled sampler plate!  I lovvvvvvve their prime rib dinner. The seasoning and temperate is making me drool just thinking about it!  The the staff are very nice and seem pretty organized on the busiest nights. I love taking my family here to relax , enjoy each other's company and eat some really good food .   Been a fan for years and I'm sure more years to come !

This place is out of control lol !  My hair turned orange after two washes . Called to let them know and to get a re-do. Receptionist took it pretty personal that I did not like my hair . She kept insisting they are a professional salon . I re-booked with another stylist because Kristina  was taking the day off. I sent an email to show how my hair was orange and her reply was to ask for shampoo I'm using . This is not a shampoo issue- even a bottle of 99 cent shampoo would not make my hair turn this bright of orange .   I called back to cancel because I found someone who is a master colorist . They had no record of me and the person hung up the phone . I thought to myself , great glad I found someone else -would of be horrible to show up and they have no idea who I am !   Now they call me 4 days later to confirm the appointment ! What a cluster of a mess.

You will be at ease!  My two malteses have boarded here twice and they come home much happier and calm. The staff are very friendly and seem to be very happy employed here. They offer a swimming pool and splash pad for the dogs.  Follow them on Facebook/Twitter and you will see how excited the dogs are staying here! They take wonderful photos and really capture the moments. They really made my birthday vacation extra special posting pictures!!  The vet doc is very nice too! the dogs were very happy to see him again .

I have been going here for both my pups. I tell everyone to go here for fast friendly & affordable pet services.  I have saved so much $$ & time here! Check out their website for prices.   My younger pup had his big day to get neutered . We had to part ways for the day & I was very worried for him. But as I was leaving, one of the vet techs was cuddling him & I even saw him give him a little pup kiss! I didn't say anything but it relieved me that my little guy was going to  be just fine!   I suggest get there early, the front waiting room is small - and if other dogs are stressed out or barking it's a lot to handle early in the morning .. At least for me ( I'm half asleep till 11am) lol!  The clinic is very clean and  has warm feeling when you enter. I even suggested my friend to take her foster dog there! And one of the gals that work there adopted the pup!   Check out this place before purchasing expensive pup plans from other places- you will not be disappointed!

Always great food!  Tonight I ordered delivery . Food was delivered by a very nice lady. I apologize I did not get her name. Wish everyone was as nice as her!  Black pepper chicken, beef chow mein, pot stickers and free crab puffs what was for dinner! We loved everything.  I love the bar when I actually go in- and need to go more often.   To the delivery lady - you rock! :)

I want to put 2.5 stars.  This place is not the best set up for concerts but it's doable if you love the band coming in.  The 99.8% is hella grumpy. I just went to pick up my concert ticket and the will-call box chick looked like she was going to die if she smiled. She most def hates her life!! The parking lot guy  was a young blond - he maybe the only happy person that works there.  The bartenders are always in a pissy mood and have no sense of  urgency  to make drinks.    The security staff are very trashy looking- worse then the most punk rock concert goer lol! They are all out of shape looking. And they are not too friendly either!    Patio is not comfortable at all- shitty tables. Their phone etiquette is not pleasant .   The only thing the place has going for them is the location & the theater it's self you can get a good view standing anywhere.  If they could change their frown to upside down I think a lot more people would appreciate it more. Be humble & smile people!! Music is great!!

Always been a favorite bar for my boyfriend & I . The vibe here is what I really look for in a bar- easy, no problems. The patio that wraps around the whole old house is really neat & really cool pond.  Cold beer & oysters is what I come in for- every time great. Bartenders are really nice & chill . They are attentive & hold good polite convos.   Only think that bummers me out is I am not closer to the location !

Love old  school dark restaurants!  This is a place to most def check out! Service is amazing and the food is heaven!  Salad cart was a big huge surprise for us- they really make you the best salad at your table - it's huge! be careful dinner is still coming!   I'm a sucker for prime rib and so is my family. The meat cut like butter and had great favor.   The service was so refreshing- old school vibe and every restaurant should get training from them before opening! These people are beyond professionals ! Way to go!!  Can't wait to come back here! Until then, I will dream about the salad cart :) lol

I need to come here a lot more!  Everything I have had here is great. Bartenders are nice, kinda chic, fun yet professional.  I prefer ordering any specialty cocktail here because they are different and delicious!  Burgers have to be my favorite food items- the meat is great quality. I don't think anyone could be disappointed with their food.   Love sitting outside - beautiful patio to watch the civic center action go by.   you can't go wrong coming here!

This place is good for one visit per trip.. If you dare!  The main attraction is the female wild ass bartenders! This act is fun, funny and not for the weak- hearted!  The girls will pick on the men in general; all for fun and to get their drink on! They demand men buy them shots !   The music is crazy loud and you can't hear any of your friends..drinks are somewhat strong- it's a good place to have a beer and a shot to get your adrenaline going!

Much needed lunch date with my good friend!  Olive and Ivy is always a great idea. The food is delicious - always consistent. The patio is very comfortable and I love the lights and trees.   My go to is  the bacon cheese burger & of course the bread and pesto . Jason was our server today. You should request him, he's very easy going and pleasant. He  provided great service and everything was wonderful.   I need to come here more often!  Wish they sold the bread and pesto in the market area!

2nd time I have been here, great breakfast restaurant !  Yummy  breakfast , fast friendly staff! The wait staff are pretty nice and usually  typical breakfast places have grumpy staff ( I don't blame them I'm not a morning person lol)  Staff seems to very well organized & restaurant is clean and happy!   I have had the same waitress both visits , she is very sweet & told me the protein pancakes were nothing to be afraid of! And she was right- very delicious!   Love they serve cocktails & beer!

How can anyone not like this bar?  A bar where you hear yourself think & talk with friends when it's still busy. I have been coming here for years and my drinks are always strong & I always enjoy talking to the bartenders. Always a lot of laughs, great guys!   Lunch is a hidden gem here, the boys know how to use the grill well ! Doc made one the most impressive bacon cheese burgers I have ever had:) St. Pattys day their corn beef is top notch!   Mike & Doc always tell me what's the new beer or booze they have- 99.9% I become a huge fan of it!  It's a dive bar, but a comfortable one. Bathrooms are always clean, not too many annoying people. Its  really great for locals to let loose!

Really nice staff tonight. It was my first time in- my mom said the yoga pants were a must try on .. So I bought them right after! Great pants , like how they carry "long" fit.   The two gals working tonight were very sweet - they seemed happy when I was happy. That's always a good feeling !

I really want to like my local store but always slow service and forgetful staff.   It's sad to always wait on deli. Takes almost 20 mins  or more to get a few things . Need faster staff !  If your order pizza and wings - they will always forget at least one thing ... The toppings, the whole pizza or the wings. Oi vay !

Happy 2015 from the Roadrunner !  What a way to bring in the new year by getting kicked out of your bar stool! Very drunk couple next to us decided to slap each other and she when flying off her seat . Couple was about 60 + years old. The male didn't help her up and my fiancé picked her up . She was about to drive and the bartender told them both they were not going to drive . Kudos to her. Meanwhile a guy who appeared he hadn't showered in awhile decides to steal my fiancé's  seat so moved down asap. 15 mins later what appeared to be the manager or even owner asked/made me move. Then proceeded to offer the drunk lady who try to drive a drink before their taxi came . Perhaps this is their "regulars" & they promote domestic violence.   What a joke. Yes it's New Year's Eve but get a grip on your bar.

Great choice on New Year's Eve !!  The whole place was nicely decorated for tonight. Every single staff member was in the best mood ever. They handed out party favors for New Year's Eve , and a glass of champagne to everyone in the bar . We always love coming here. If you love salads - this is the place to go! All food is really good and crazy affordable !   Thank you for tonight Dukes! We  love your rocky point location too - you do a great job staffing both locations. The owner is really nice guy  - been on the cardinal game  party bus before.   Need to make this place our regular place to go.

So sad to write this but it needs to be fixed ASAP! Please have a manager !!!  Past few times horrible service . We won't see our server for a very long time and won't get drinks unless we start another tab at the bar .  Honestly -anyone - just stick with sitting at the bar . It's very hard to track out anyone for a meal,drink or bill.  ( and it's not that busy )  Sad .not sure if we will be back for awhile .

It's not my most favorite places to go in Oldtown-  I always drag my feet when we have friends who wanna go. There are a few good bartenders that are attentive but the rest of the staff is blah. The bouncers are very out of shape & grumpy - and it's just not a fun vibe place unless you are a little bit on the trashy side and enjoy  bar fights . I think the west side & very south Scottsdale crew would enjoy this place way more .   I went to the opening years ago, and it was way more together back then. The vibe was more welcoming & cozy. Now, watch ur back for beers thrown, angry drunks in tight tees & painted on eyebrows.

Food poisoned ! Ruined my Vegas trip !  The restaurant is beautiful but that's it. This is a very basic Italian restaurant. We asked if the mozzarella was made in house.. Hesitation from server and then said yes. ( did not look or taste fresh )  I had the lobster risotto- food poisoned ! Awful way to begin a Vegas trip.   You will see awesome Sinatra memorabilia so that was neat . But nothing too exciting here. Very over hyped .

Very clean location. All employees are very friendly and helpful. Some employees are much more knowledgeable about products - which is great!   I would not suggest grooming services at any petco or petsmart. Both companies have not been educated on how to trim nails or hair cuts. No one wants to pick up their puppy with bloody nails and a strange hair cut!   Everything is easy to find, and staff always seems happy. Sometimes the sales on toys and treats are very exciting !

Cozy, chic and loved every minute!   What a great piano bar! Nice change from typical Vegas bars.  Last time I came here was in October - I hope the same bartenders & lounge singers/piano players will there for my July trip!   Everyone is very talented who performs; if you are lucky some of the bar staff jumps on the mic.   Great vibes, yummy cocktails and lovely music!

So other items are pretty good , but burgers and shakes is where it's at ! But not at same time - too much ! :)   Hope they are here to stay and never go away !

This place is a joke. Whatever you do--don't pay extra for feta cheese cuz you won't get it lol! 2nd time this has happened. 1st time, okay I understand but 2nd time - now your just making free $$ .  Asked for my gyro with feta cheese, tomatoes & lettuce. Lettuce went missing too! My asst. Ordered a chicken pita & there was 4 very small pieces dried up pieces of chicken.  I called to today to let them know they needed to pick up the pace & not rip people off with feta cheese, & lack of lettuce and lack of chicken of my assts lunch. But the owner answered and told me to speak with the person who made the lunches!! Are you kidding me ? What owner puts their cook on the phone ? A lazy one!! Yes, the cook messed up but to put the cook on the phone to handle the situation ?! The cook even said it was unprofessional of the owner to put him on the phone.   So, you will not get feta, lettuce, decent chicken or a answer from management/owner.. But the cook is forced to talk with angry customers! Lol! What a joke!

I love Tory Burch for their flip flops!  Store is very organized and comfortable. Great couches for those who are trying on shoes or waiting on a shopper.  Jennifer is very helpful and sent a nice thank you email after my purchases. All staff are friendly and don't have a grumpy stuck up attitude like most stores in Fashion Square Mall.   If you are looking for flip flops that will last you awhile and are chic- try the Thora sandals- been a long time favorite of mine! I wear these year-round.  I will be back soon.. Perhaps a new purse !

No one deserves to be hounded because the stylist cancels .  Today I was suppose to go in for a Brazilian blowout . A little after 8am, the manager/front desk Paulsen texts me saying Erika is sick and he went ahead and booked a later appointment with another stylist .  First off , ASK. Do not assume I want to go to a different stylist at a different time . I texted back, no thanks- and that time would not work with my schedule and I didn't know the substitute's work. And texting that early on a personal number is unprofessional.  He persisted on texting and calling me and trying to convince me the time and stylist is what I needed.  Then Erika texted  me saying I should go to the substitute .   Then more phone calls from salon. Then a text reminder I scheduled the appointment today . ( I didn't sign up at that time why am I getting text reminders?!? ) Then a voicemail from the owner asking if I was coming in.  I do not understand why such the confusion & persistence when it was clear I said no thanks . I am at work and I thought no thanks means no appointment ( I can't keep looking at my phone for calls and texts )   A simple - "okay no problem , call us to reschedule " would of been ideal .  Last visit I was very pleased on my hair , I even talked to Erica and the owner what my needs were for a Brazilian blowout for awhile. Erika had my trust she was going to do a great Brazilian blow out in future.   I even sent my good friend in to get her hair done this week . Erika was booked, Charlie was her stylist . My friend enjoyed her services, but noticed salon was pushy to book next appointment .   This salon needs to take a chill pill and respect no is no . I will not be returning even thou Erika did a nice job on my first visit . Shame on them for giving me such high anxiety & interrupting my work day -- I need a drink lol.   I should post all the missed calls and texts for humor purposes.

As first I was skeptical... But mad I haven't been a fan longer!  Chopped salad, pastrami pork belly, kilt lifter fondue and scallops what was for dinner!  I don't even like scallops and I thought they were okay! My fiancé sure did love them, he said the best he has had since City Hall. The chopped salad is a must do-- see my tip!!   AJ was our sever and he had his hands full of tables. He must be the most friendliest server I have had. He was very engaging with us and the rest of his tables. He even sent us home with a dessert! I know I will request him next time we dine here.  I love the lighting in this restaurant too , very romantic and calm.  Great place !

Great to walk around and beat the heat! Love the over all Caesars vibe.   As for the stores.. Ehh. Call me spoiled but most of these stores are already near me in my city. I'm not too impressed on over the top places. When I shop- I wanna be able to shop- not just browse! It would be nice to throw in some more fun unique stores everyone can afford!   I got my fill for a few years checking everything out- I will try back in a few more years- see if anything changed!

Rating is for poor management and front desk .   I have a handful of issues booking appointments. Rude tone . Messed up appointment times . Was told a couple  times the stylist I preferred was booked ( he was not ) .   Have multiple charges for items I did not buy. Called to speak to manager - did not call me back . Called again , and was told I would get a call back about issue . Waited 48 hours , still no call .  Canceled my membership due poor customer service .   Awful !!

I love this drive thru on the way to work! Staff is always really nice and drinks are always strong. Always 5 stars  The only thing I would change is their persistence to ask me questions about myself! I will not give them a less star because of what their told to do- but just sometimes it can be overbearing - really sweet staff thou!

I had one of your mini cupcakes at a Giants baseball game for the first time- Setting up your adorable food trunk was a GREAT idea! I wish I was able to have more- But I was quite full from lunch. I only hope Gigi's cupcakes has a store in old town Scottsdale one day soon! You guys would kick Sprinkles booty! I can not wait to go back to a Giants spring training game and order more! Great work!!! :o)

Great staff!!!  Came in with my mom yesterday, heard by a friend this is the place to be! The whole store was 25% off and skirts were 40% off.  The two women that were working we're so personable and helpful to both my mother & I . The clothing is super cute and very comfortable. Highly suggest checking them out before going heading in any other active store-  their prices are great and you might find something even better!

Glad I stopped in for lunch!  I recommend the Wisconsin cheddar cauliflower soup. I had the crab avocado panini - did not care for the bread but everything in it was very good .   The restaurant can get very messy because customers do not take the time to put away their trashes and garbage correctly . The clean up staff worked really hard keeping everything nice and clean .   The front staff was very friendly and fast . Clean up  staff were very helpful and sweet .  I'll be back for more !

Great food! The pig wigs are the best! Patio is great too! Kinda confused on their deli section( fine meats)  of the restaurant. They should knock it down & make more room for guests!

Great food & nice  staff !  Hollie has been my server the past two times . She's very friendly and has a good memory! She remembered me and it felt good !   I really like their bean dip served with chips and everything else I have tried has been quite yummy . Food is always fresh and hot ! My friend said they have the best hot dog; so that will be my next choice for next time.   This is my place to go to before I get my hair done and I'm quite happy I found it !

Great presentations on the yelp event !   Snow cones with Tito's vodka were very delicious. The two gentlemen who worked the booth were very sweet, fast & know how to make a drink!   I would recommend their services to anyone, love the idea of refreshing snow cones with booze! Hopefully I will have a party soon!   Great job! :)

I love that fashion square finally has this store! Not only do I love the stores products but the employees are really nice.  I had purchased 2 sports bras & a work out top online- it was past the 14 day return policy but hey that's okay -- I know I would find a bunch of things for exchange! I also purchased a pair of cotton yoga pants, I did wear them but after the first wash- they did not fit the same :/ I explained to the sales girl and she did not give me any trouble for exchanging them for something I liked! Whew! I was pretty worried, lulu is not cheap!   The store is very organized, and easy to see what's new. My only complaint is : it's very hot temp wise! Trying on lots of yoga clothing is not fun when you are a little sweaty! This has happened more than once at this location.  The staff are pretty informational and are super friendly!  Of course I will be a repeat customer !  I can not get enough yoga pants!

1 star knocked from first impression /host stand .  Both hostesses were very odd and cold . Asked for a booth twice ( only one at the time being used ) was told no . The table we were sat at was wobbly ( asked for it to be fixed ) hostess did not come back .  Told the waiter I wanted a booth and the table was wobbly . But the looks of it the host staff might have gave him alittle trouble moving us . But he was able to move us ! ( literally 7 feet away )  Food was very good ! And came out crazy fast !  We will return and I will make sure booth is in the RVSP and hope host staff is not rude again !! Hope management sees this review .

Beware of Sam the order taker! She will laugh at you for ordering too much food!   Today, we are moving lots of furniture. There is a big group of us, we are hungry & Mcdonalds seems easy,  fast and efficient.. Right?? No no no!  It's was my job to grab lunch for the group. I came up  to the drive thru, and Ordered 6 mcdoubles.. The order taker Sam's reply is "wow 6 mcdoubles, that's a lot of mcdoubles" ( laughing )  Me : "yes 6" Sam: "you must be so hungry for 6 mcdoubles, wow!! ) still laughing)  Me: "well yah I'm 400 pounds, of course I want all this food" Then I ordered more to the order, because that's what my group requested.  My friend & I were in shock! We could not believe a fast food order taker could be so condescending and rude!!   I requested to talk to a manager and I had told her what happened. She was very apologetic, which I understand it's not her fault her staff are rude kids. I told her she needed to get my order and I was not going to go up to the next window because I would go off on Sam.   As I was waiting, the window staff member asked me to move to the next window. I told him no, I was waiting for the manager and I would not move till I got my order. He rolled his eyes. He was a stocky rude boy.  The manager  came back out with our "HUGE" order and apologized again and gave me a punch card for a free value meal. I told her it wasn't her fault but she does need to get a grip on her rude staff.  McDonald's , this is not how we know you. I'm still utterly disgusted with the service I received today. I will NEVER be back at this location again and I will be writing corporate.   Advice : Go to Indian school & Hayden location, they are friendly fast and not rude.  They don't care how much or how little you order!

Maybe this place has potential?  The theme of this bar is nice. Very comfortable.   Came here on a Sunday afternoon, not very busy. We received zero service for a cocktail waitress. Not even a "Hello" . Our party of 5 made about 15 trips to the bar, so she missed out on a decent sized  tab! Even ordered food from bartender.   Not sure if I would go out of my way to visit again.. So many other  Oldtown bars with average to great service from waitresses.. Why come back to ZERO ??

I have been pretty excited to finally come in! If you have been to Spanish fly and Drift  you will see they kept a lot of the same things and made it their own too. Which doesn't bother me, just makes me think of memories from the past! My first date with my boyfriend was at Drift! But if you are newly 21 you will not know the similarities!   I really enjoy the openness of the patio- but I am afraid to come here summer time! It will be a hot one! I sat where the sun directly hit my eyes, which they need to get a shade for the bartenders & guests.   The staff was pretty nice. And the security was even pleasant ! So that was nice to see smiles & noticed everyone was helping each other.  It was "carb Sunday" so we enjoyed their fries & macaroni. Both awesome, fries would of been heaven if they were cooked for a little bit longer.  The place does have some extra  Scottsdale annoyance with the people that go there- but you will find that anywhere in Oldtown!  They have a bunch if different games to play with groups which I noticed everyone loved.   I will be back, and I hope a lot!

Ehhh. Nothing too exciting here.  $15 for a well cocktail & bottle of bud light. Very crowded on a Sunday afternoon so people must enjoy getting ripped off ?   It's a bar that I will not remember to come back to, nothing stuck out that made it different .  Also noticed bouncers being choosey on letting certain folk in.. On a Sunday afternoon?! I didn't have any issues.. But I know  for a fact, the Mint group does this on purpose to keep a "image" ... Heard same owners as Mint ?  Not quite sure. Nothing worse than a egoistic door guy- get real dudes!

DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU LOVED THE PAST SALTY'S!  This is horrible news, Because it is not too hard to be nice to guests in your restaurant. Party of 6, and we are ready to enjoy our Sunday with great friends, enjoy some drinks and food.  We waited 30 mins for our first round of drinks. We waited an hour and a half for our food. I requested a glass with my beer and did not receive it. Our food came out wrong. Multiple food runners came coming to our table asking if we ordered this or that. The balding tall ( he thinks hes really buff) blonde manager came by- he had quite the attitude !  We mentioned how horrible the service was and how we didn't really care for the taco presentation( 1 guest has a handicap & passing tacos out of the taco holder was not easy ) - his reply was "Don't you know how to pass a taco" This guy sucks and needs to go back to planet fitness and work on his muscles, because he does not help any servers doing anything. Service staff needs bar rescue!   Beer tub/champagne and orange girls had no line- so we decided to grab a drink from them, they need to be taught how to serve drinks- it was like a 8 year handing me a glass of lemonade from a lemonade stand.     Looks like the owners got kinda lazy setting up the place too- back patio had a bunch of trash-  you guys will not survive after spring training!!! STEP UP YOUR GAME !

So creeped out and bummed !!  So the first visit was great, I had a fill on my nails and the nail tech helped me achieve the best nude color for my upcoming wedding . I am mad at myself for not remembering her name but she has shorter hair and very quiet . No issues with her at all.  Two weeks later I came in for a new set and a spa pedicure. I got Jimmy . He did a great job on my new set and my toes looked good too . I did tip  him very well because of how good nails looked .  So before writing this review I asked around to friends , another nail salon and people who in general get pedicures-- How high does a massage go on your legs? Many told me not past the knee , a couple told me just a little bit past the knee. Well my massage went all the way up to my crotch area ! I was wearing a dress and he kept going higher and higher and I was so confused and wondering if that's what I picked on the foot spa menu .. He most def touched my underwear and he knew I got scared. ( no this isn't a porn scene lol) When it was time to do my new set he explained I had a lot of stress on my legs and next time I needed to relax and trust him. I am just so bummed because he did in fact do a great job but being that aggressive and persistent to massage that high was really weird !  So, I will not be returning unfortunately- no happy ending for me ! So ladies, advice - just request a female for pedicures in general wherever you go.   I would call if I knew they weren't so busy and loud -- calling would be more than a headache than what  it's worth . There are so many other nail spots.

Love this place!  Samuel our server was great! We came in for the lobster rolls and they were amazing! The tavern is beautiful and to the point. Great for date nights or to even impress a first date! My fiancé and I can not wait to come back!! This might be a weekly hang out spot for us :) next to try : Killer corn beef

Finally a clean movie theater ! I really hope it stays clean, somewhat quite and comfortable ! Seats are wonderful. Bathrooms were spotless .   The only downfall : parking. Pretty pricey parking garage near theater.. but beats driving around forever to find something decent . But that's Tempe for yah ! Bring exact change or charge to ur credit card. $12 for two hours.   Our new favorite theater for sure!

My go to super fast Mexican food place!  I am kinda of addicted to their food. Drive thru is super fast and everything seems to be pretty fresh. I might have to go tomorrow !   It's new so I haven't had to deal with a long line - hopefully they keep up with their great customer service!

We stopped in for two hot chocolates . And boy were they yummy! Made from scratch and very rich!  We had already ate dinner , but the menu looked impressive . Simple quick and delicious . The treats they bake looked pretty darn good too!  The staff was super sweet, helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Especially the staff member who made the hot chocolates ! She brought out marshmallows and they made my night. I haven't had one in years lol .    We will be back and I can not wait ..I want this restaurant to be in my neighborhood     !

This store has great staff and wonderful merchandise. Everything is well sorted and displayed ( not a mess ) . The female cashier with dark long hair  who returned my Hautelook orders were very patient and sweet. The male cashier with the tattoos was engaging and funny! They both liked talking about clothes , which was nice. The blond male dressing room attendant was also super friendly and not grumpy that I gave him back items I was not purchasing. ( normally I cringe when dealing with unhappy dressing room staff, so thank you!) But don't worry we purchased a bunch of great things!    The only thing that threw me off was were the store placed the check out line. Normally the check out lines are in the front of the store . Look to your far right against the wall !   This will be my go-to location for now on! Thank  you for a nice experience;)

In love !  I love the decor of this diner . The booths are very comfortable.   Service was great . The food was great . The Bloody Mary was great !   I had the Cobb salad and my husband had the eggs Benedict. He said it was the best he has had - and he has had many !   Can not wait to go back ! So many things to try and love ! This restaurant is a great addition to Tempe .

Don't waste your time on "s and s" nails here . Shaping was below average . My middle fingers are different shapes lol ! She cut too deep on one finger and I bled for a bit , she claimed I am "sensitive " . The final polish (clear ) was bumpy . I went back 30 mins later to show the guy up front and he told me to come back another day, in a very condescending.  big sign says , if you are not happy - let them know ) Asked for a refund and was yelled at . Other customers saw and came up to be after in the parking lot to ask what had happened . Completely embarrassing and uncalled for from this man .   Do not choose Lynn if you come here . Spent $170 here for pedicure and "s and s" nails . Great tips for both techs. I always tip well to any tech .   Shame on this place . My bank will be contacting you soon .   **UPDATE**  Two voicemails .one from Jennifer , a manager who was apologetic and said to come back any time to fix. 2nd voicemail , same rude guy saying to come back another day and not today  AGAIN ! And to disregard the other voicemail ! His point was very clear in person - needs to get over himself ASAP .  He should not be up front dealing with customers . What a joke .  Went to Walgreens and they said I was most definitely infected and advised me to not go back there( and take a break till I healed )  , dirty tools and poor technique ( by looking at cut) .  ***UPDATE on June 14th***  Read comment from Jason . They called twice with the voicemails I stated above . Ridiculous.

The only thing I would change in this restaurant would be adding booths . I think it would add a more warm and comfortable feeling .   The service was great for lunch . We absolutely loved the egg drop soup ! My husband love the fried rice and he keeps talking about going back for it lol!  I really liked how clean the bathrooms were. The bar was very nicely set up .  I can not wait to try more food !

Love the food ! Can not wait to try more items .  It does take a very long time to get your food . That's why one star dropped . There was only a few people in - so kitchen needs to step it up ASAP .   The patio is perfect on a windy afternoon!
