ABSOLUTE WORST APARTMENTS EVER! DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! The Management are incompetent fools who will tell you ANYTHING you want to hear. They will leave out important information that you should know, or they will tell you something completely different. ROACHES EVERYWHERE! I even used to live in Boston and NYC and I have never seen a roach problem so bad.   Tonight was the final straw... I came back from a vacation and on the one day that my cat sitter did not come by, my AC went down. Since there is not a direct number to the emergency maintenance line, you have to call the office. It just so happens that the office's phone lines are down. So here I am, exhausted from driving for hours, no AC, and two very upset kitties. I packed everything up again and headed to the nearest pet friendly hotel. As I write this, I have no idea what the outcome will be, but I guarantee I WILL NOT BE RENEWING MY LEASE!   At this point, I will be blasting Papago Crossing on every social media site I can. If these issues are not addressed in a timely fashion, I will be contacting an attorney.   I'll say this... Nothing would make me happier than to see these buildings condemned.

I've been a long time fan of the filibertos franchise, and have visited many locations across the valley. This particular location is one of my favorites. The staff is friendly, the orders are accurate, and the food quality is great compared to many other locations. No skimpy burritos or guacamole that looks like green water at this Fili-B's!

The sliders are the way to go. Nothing closer in Phx to white castle than Chicago Hamburger Co. The minced onions are perfect!  Bob's Big @$$ Burger is another favorite of mine.  Staff is friendly and the restaurant has all sorts of cool Chicago decor.  I stop in for lunch at least once every couple of weeks, if not more.

I haven't been here in a few years and decided to stop in for a sandwich. I must say how impressed I was with Philly's Famous compared to other local cheesesteak places. While I normally take my cheesesteak with wiz, I was very excited to see them offer a red sauce as many of my friends from philly claim this is one of the ways they do it back home.   Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, and the sandwich was good. What more could I have asked for?  I'll definitely be remembering Philly's Famous for when I get the craving.

I come here all the time! Best Chinese food in the valley! Coming from Boston, I missed good and authentic Chinese. This is the place to go!

I was a little worried based off other reviews, but I am giving it 5 stars simply because it was the best in the area that I've had.  I miss The chinese food of my hometown (Boston) but once in a while, I find a place i like.  The ORANGE CHICKEN WITH BACON is to die for!

I recently purchased their Chicago style pizza and was greatly disappointed. The crust was flavorless and too thin on the bottom. I can't say I like the sauce that much either. I may give their regular pizza a shot sometime, but I don't feel like I will be returning anytime soon.  The wings were delicious though. It's too bad the pizza was so meh.

I can't believe it took me so long to go! The food was fantastic and well worth the price. I'm fairly certain I ate 50 dollars in filet alone. Considering the fact that I have spent more money on a single steak without sides at a traditional steakhouse, you definitely get bang for your buck with Fogo!   My only complaints are based on the service. There were numerous occasions where my date and I were ready for more meat (with our cards flipped up on the "ready" side) and the servers would come to the table next to us, with their backs turned to us and walk away when done.  They never bothered to check if our table or any others behind us were also wanting any. In addition, our main server definitely could have used some wine training as he was not able to tell us anything about the wines we asked about.  Despite some poor service situations, all in all, I was very impressed and will be back soon.

So glad they reopened this location! I absolutely love their sandwiches and was devastated when the original AZ franchise owner closed up shop. I'm so glad that corporate has taken over and come back to the Phoenix market. I plan on stopping in as often as possible.

Visited today and had as pleasant an experience as possible. While I had to wait for a little while, the time was filled with paperwork and Facebook on my phone. The staff was kind and caring and I was on my way within a reasonable amount of time. After a very terrible experience at another local urgent care, I was rather worried about how I would be treated. I can happily say that Phoenix Urgent Care will be my new first choice in the area.

Serious let down. Squid ink had reached out to a large group that I am a part of. (an unofficial fan club of Phoenix Comicon with over 10 thousand members) to do a cross promotion with us, Phoenix Comicon, and themselves. They had promised our group leadership an official roll for the event. We spent weeks promoting them to our members, and when we began to arrive, the staff was completely clueless in regards to any promotion and there was no themed roll made for us.   We easily sent them hundreds of people tonight and they completely let us down. I will never return to this business.

Came in and sat at the bar. A decent amount of time passed without a single bartender (out of 3) acknowledging us. In fact it was almost as if they were refusing to make eye contact with us. As someone who tends bar, I can understand if you are busy (which they were slow enough to goof off together and with the customers) but at least acknowledge my presence before I've been sitting there for 10 minutes without even someone saying that they will be there to help me.  Got up and went to Calico Jacks next door and the service was fantastic.

I have always loved BBQ of all kinds, and have been to damn near every BBQ joint in the Phoenix-metro area... But little miss has won my heart!  Joe's real BBQ is shit compared to Little Miss!  Best brisket I've ever had and the jalepeno cheese grits are a must! Prices are just right for quality bbq, expect to spend 25-40 a person depending on your appetite.  Or do what I do, and drop about 75 dollars so you have leftovers for 2-3 meals. The meat reheats wonderfully!  Get there before opening though! Like any classic BBQ stand, the parking lot fills quickly, and the line forms fast.  People on yelp have complained about how long they have to stand in line, but you can't rush perfection. I've literally stood in longer lines for hot dogs. While you're waiting, rediscover the lost art of conversation with those around you, bring a book, or make sure your phone is charged and you'll be ordering your food before you know it.   The staff is exceptional as well. Friendly and attentive and always handing out delicious free samples.   My friends and I have recently started planning monthly MEATINGS at Little Miss, and I can't wait for our next one!  I only wish they had a larger or second location.

As a lover of seafood, Angry Crab has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is quick (though you may have to wait for a table).  While normally I gravitate to New England style seafood, Angry Crab sure hits the spot when I want a big bag of buttery and spicy mussels. Just be careful with the spice level! Start out low and work your way up. Even most spicy food lovers I know don't usually go above level 3.  If you get JK as your server, be prepared for a man who is larger than life! He's a great guy, with a passion for food, and he'll make sure that you're well taken care of.  Also... don't say no to the hush puppies. I may come for the delicious seafood boils, but the hush puppies are my weakness. One of these days I'm gonna get like 10 orders to go.   Be prepared to get messy, but don't worry... they give you a bib. You'll need it.

Currently sitting here now. While the food has been delightful so far, the service has been severely lacking. We started our evening by walking in to the restaurant and up to the counter, where the server had her back to the door and us for several minutes. My friend and I stood there talking and while I hoped that the sound of our voices would cause her to turn around and notice us, it did not actually happen until she went to move away from the counter.   The entire ordering process was painful as she kept telling us that "she'd be right back". Despite only having one other table at the time, this girl seemed to have a great deal of trouble multitasking.  Considering how much I enjoyed the original location in Phoenix, I'm greatly disappointed with my experience tonight.

While I enjoy the selection of beer, that is about the only thing I enjoy about this bar. I have visited them twice now and both times have been service nightmares.  On this last visit, the staff seemed terribly overwhelmed. Especially the bartender. It's clear that there is a lack of teamwork and communication amongst the crew.   The food takes forever, and from what I can tell, none of it should. Having spent years working in food service, no burger should ever take 40+ minutes.   Still haven't quite figured out how to actually play games there... little to no signage and staff seems too busy to help.  Won't be going back willingly... despite their good beer.

Just stopped in for the first time today. I got the 1776 (Roast Beef, Cheddar, and Horseradish) and a side of Mac and Cheese. While I will admit that I thought that the sandwich could have used more horseradish (I can never have too much), it was a very quality sandwich for the price and being a fast food option.   The mac and cheese on the other hand... WAS AMAZING! Holy crap... I will be getting that again.  Service was solid. Not much to say on that. The counter staff was friendly and seemed to be able to do their job well.   If you are in the area and don't want something boring and disgusting like Jimmy John's or Subway, I highly recommend stopping in for a bite. Most likely, you won't regret it.

I visit Stufrageous as often as possible! The concept is fantastic and they execute it almost without flaw! I do wish the patties were a little bigger, as the stuffing often comes through the bottom.   The stuffing options are fantastic and you are insane if you pass up the pepper jack mac and cheese bites!

I seriously cannot stop coming here. I've already lost track of how many times I've visited in the few short of weeks that they've been open. The food is so good! The classic poutine is fantastic and all the tasty variations are wonderful. I seriously dream of their food. You need to do yourself the favor and stop by.  P.S. If the owner sees this, your employees should have a tip jar. They work very hard and i greatly appreciate the service. In my last few visits, I've tried to slip them a little bit here and there.
