Loved the salon itself... It is beautifully decorated and The owner also very nice and informative. I went to get extensions done by a stylist named Joe. The hair looked beautiful great cut and awesome price for individual strands but still paid $800 plus to have done (think it was 950 after tip and supplies). It was the first time I had ever done them so wasn't sure what to expect. The extensions though looked good were horrible. CONSTANTLY a tangled mess (to the point of matting if I literally did not brush every hour) and later I found out they had used super cheap hair which was why they were. They said they would work with what price I could spend saying normally higher but would give me a deal.... not worth it and wouldn't have EVER spent if they were honest from the get go. The individual strands would consistently come out ripping out my real hair with the beads that held them. Joe did put them back in once 2 weeks after I had done and didn't charge (only took tip) but they were out almost instantly again. I tried texting Joe again when same problem arose and he never returned my texts so I actually went to another salon to have taken out. Needless to say $800 was a TON of money to have spent for something that barely lasted a month and I was NOT happy! So much so I was hesitant on ever getting them again but I have since and have had them for 6 months now problem free so that's why NOW I'm writing this review. I didn't want to write if it was something I had done wrong. This salon has a lot of good reviews which is what drove me towards it but I truly felt I got ripped off. And this only reflects on the one stylist as I had no interaction with any other. But please beware as I don't want to see this happen to anyone else.

This place has the best service I have ever experienced with a nail salon! They are beyond good with my daughter... Treat us like royalty. They massage you with every service and not just a quick "get it done" massage but they take their time! They even massage your face when getting eyebrows done! Same pricing as every other salon in the area. I won't go anywhere else.

HORRIBLE! If I could give these guys a 0 star rating I would and If I had to pick a word for this facility it would be ghetto. I have never written a bad review on anyone before and yeah... It's THAT BAD! I have spent the last three days trying to get shot records for my daughter as she is starting a new school and the Cave Creek location is always closed. Monday they told me tues, tues they said Wednesday and now today (which is the final day of enrollment at 3pm and I work at 1 pm) they say they won't open until 2. WHAT DR OFFICE ONLY OPENS AT 2?!?!?!When you call you receive the other location down in Phoenix and the people down there are SUPER unhelpful and rude and give you the run around. First they say to fax over the medical release form but then tell me they say I have to wait until 2pm anyhow today until someone goes into their Cave Creek facility as only there they can access my child's records. Needless to say It looks like I will be taking off work to now deal with this further so parents do yourselves a favor and stay away!

Love this place! They just expanded to a new shop and it's absolutely beautiful! Nice people. Only negative is it is a bit slow but for a lazy Sunday morning the slow is actually great! Gives it a nice cozy feeling in a family atmosphere.
