Now I've spent my time in plenty of busy Starbucks. I've been there during the morning rush, the afternoon rush and no matter how busy it's been, the drinks, not just mine but everyone's, were served in a timely and efficient manner. Also, the drinks were correct and tasted great! I've been to this Starbucks twice in the past three months - the first time it was steady, not too busy, and the second time there were only 2 people in front of me. Each time the store has had three employees behind the counter, and each time it's taken about 10 minutes to get the orders out. Why? Seriously, why?  If it was the baristas' first day, okay maybe, but unless you're sculpting the cup you're serving them in, or picking the coffee beans yourself, or having to beat/whip that frappucino by hand, then there's no real clear reason why your customers should have to wait that long for their Venti iced what-nots and coffee with half & half.

This is one of my most favorite movie theaters in Phoenix! Like most other yelpers have pointed out, it's hardly ever crowded, even during the summer and its mindless "blockbusters". Even with ASU being downtown, it's hard to find a theater inside with more than 10 people.  Harkins may offer popcorn t-shirts and $1 drink cups, but I'll take this one thanks to the lack of moviegoers. You hardly have to worry about rushing to find a good seats or phones ringing in the middle of a film. There's only one time out of the years I've been going here where I had to tell a group to shut it, and that was after the manager asked them to be quiet too.  Plus, it's close to buses and light rail stops, and there's a Subway and Starbucks to sneak your food in, not that I would do such a thing...

This is the type of bar you hit first on the bar crawl nights. It's fun, the bartenders are super friendly and attentive, and the crowd is a big mish-mash of young, old, ethnicities, skinny, fat, skinny fat and what not. It almost feels like an intimate neighborhood bar at times.  However, it seems each time I've gone in on the weekends, the place clears out around 10-1030 when everyone heads to a dance club.  Still it's fun, especially Thursdays when they have a trivia night. I miss my old team, Anal Beads & Things.  Plus, it's right off the light rail between the stops for Osborne and Thomas, so you can ride there, go home, or ride to one of the bars on the light rail path!

WOW! I had read and heard alot of good things about Smeeks and I thought, "It must be too good to be true," and while out shopping for a few items today, I was proven wrong.  I walked in and I instantly felt like a kid in a candy store. They had candy, fun novelties, and I swear everything I looked at it made me think of a friend who would love to find it in their stocking on Christmas day.  The store was packed (it is 3 days before Christmas), but the staff was friendly, helpful and went around to make sure everyone found what they needed or if they needed a basket.  Guys, I'll be back here throughout the year, and you should check it out. If it doesn't make you smile or make you want to sift through all the goodies, you probably kick kittens for fun (and that's not cool!).

This place is way out of my zip code. I usually go to the Hallmark at Camelback Colonnade, and if I make it out there, Scottsdale Fashion Square, but I dig this place. Plus it's in the same ginormous shopping center as Genghis Grill! It's smaller than the one I usually go to, but I kinda like that, but let me share a tale with you.  Picture it: the weekend before Christmas 2010. An insane, olive-skinned gay boy with a thick head of fabulous looking hair, who lives in Central Phx, hears about a great sale involving Snoopy and card at a Hallmark store. The store though happens to be this one and in Tempe, which feels like a million miles away.  The olive-skinned gay boy braves the elements and heads to a packed shopping center and a packed store, and from the moment he enters, he's very impressed with the calm professionalism of the staff working in this Hallmark store. They're kind, courteous, helpful, and no matter how packed the store, staff members were easy to find in the case you needed that special card for the dogsitter.  In the end, the olive-skinned gay purchases a lot of sale items, and tells the cashier he wants to make two purchases due to the two coupons he has. The cashier smiles and says, "Oh, let's make this easy, you can use both coupons for the one purchase!" Helpful and doing the best to make the purchase seamless and easy during a crazy holiday season? HECK YEAH! The olive-skinned gay boy is impressed and very satisfied, and decides that even though this Hallmark takes a light rail and two bus rides, it may be worth it.

This 'bucks is right down the street from my house, so whenever I get a caffeine fix, I take a little walk to my local Starbucks. It does suck that this, Pei Wei and SideBar took over the fierce Emerald Lounge, but business is business.  Anyway, in no time at all the staff knew my name and my drink. Does that mean I go there too much or they're just that good? I vote for the latter, and on top of it these guys know the right way to make my drink. I've tried to explain my drink to other baristas in other stores from Phoenix to LA to Vegas to San Francisco (jeez I visit Starbucks too much), and they never get it quite right.  Also the place is usually spotless, even when it's crowded, which makes for a great hang out spot.

Jeesh I drink too much coffee!   Each day when I get ready for work it's hard to decide where to go for my caffeine fix - this Dunkin' Donuts close to work or the Starbucks down the street from my house.  I've never had an issue with donuts here, and not with their coffee either. The place is usually spotless with a few people hanging out or having a meeting or appointment, and the straw bin is always full.  The staff, for the most part, are super nice, friendly and quick whether it's in-store or in the drive-thru.  Also and more importantly, the coffees (Iced and Hot) and lattes and such, are generally a little cheaper than Starbucks, which is good during those time you have to be a little more economical before next payday!  As for donuts, each time I've ordered them (which is mid-afternoon) there hasn't been a shortage. Oh, and their flatbread sandwiches...they're good! The bread is light, fluffy, and the insides are nice and gooey!
