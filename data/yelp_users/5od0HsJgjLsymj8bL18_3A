One of the best places in central Phoenix to eat. Great food, great ambiance and excellent service. My new favorite place.

I used to love Maize's. Five dollar burger Monday, balsamic French fries, their selection of pizzas and great service. But I went with friends a week ago for the first time since the menu changed and we were all very disappointed. No more balsamic fries, and most of the new menu items sounded awful. I had the chartrucerie appetizer plate and someone else ordered the wings. The were both okay, nothing special. Our service was awful. We arrived about 15 minutes before happy hour ended but by the time our server came to get our drink order, it was 3 minutes past hh time and we had to pay full price for our beer. Not a big deal, but annoying. Our server was inattentive the rest of the meal. With so many great places to eat in the Central  Corridor, Our former neighborhood favorite is off our dining list.

I've been to El Chorro several times for brunch and it has always been wonderful. Both food and service .Last Sunday's brunch with family from out of town was so disappointing. Our waiter was snarky to the point of being rude. My husband wanted jalapenos in this omelette and the waiter refused, stating they had jalapenos but not for that particular omelette. The server continued to be rude and snippy the entire meal. I had the beet salad, which I've had before but it's been changed. It was 4 beets on a plate with a bit of lettuce and goat cheese on top. Definitely not a salad. Mediocre food, indifferent service We won't be back.

Just had the El Pastor Burro for lunch. Definitely worth the drive from North Scottsdale.

What a wonderful service Angel Vets provides. Putting my 15 year old lab to sleep was so hard but Julie and Dr Veena were wonderful. It was handled with dignity and compassion. Raider quietly crossed over with no pain.

The food is wonderful. We had a pizza and a Greek salad. Both were amazing. The pizza crust is probably the best I've ever had. The service was prompt and friendly as well. A great addition to the neighborhood!

The service was great. We were going to have dinner but since are appetizers was just ok, we walked up the street to Fuego Bistro instead. I really wanted to love the Herb Box since it's within walking distance, but with so many great choices in the neighborhood, there is no reason to settle for just OK food.
