I had the Maui bowl w/white rice & it was delicious! I normally don't eat white rice, but the teriyaki sauce provided plenty of flavor so it didn't taste bland. They automatically provide an extra sauce, but I didn't have to use it since there was enough in the bowl. Called in the order for about 5 employees & food was ready w/in 15 minutes of placing the order. Very efficient at accommodating special orders such as food substitutions and/or adding ingredients. Will definitely come again.

Always friendly staff ready to greet customers & place their orders. I stick to the classic pepperoni pizza and it's always made to taste buds' heaven. I've gone in during a lunch hour work & high school early release rush and I still was able to enjoy a decent amount of time for lunch i.e. they were quick to serve. So far, no complaints on my end.

Service and food at this location are excellent. My last visit was on Easter Sunday. For it being a holiday and the restaurant being plenty busy, my sister and I waited less than 25 minutes to be seated. This went the same for the time we placed our order and received our food. If you want a better alternative to Denny's or IHOP, come to Black Bear Diner.

Friendly and efficient service. Ordered the cod and shrimp combo and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch and dinner.

I would have to agree with another rater in that the actual eye doctor's service is great, but the remaining staff falls short. The front office receptionist was quite frazzled and all over the place. I felt bad for the patient ahead of me since his information went from being unable to find to being misplaced; just a huge mess. He was a patient man, but I was frustrated for him & I didn't even know the guy. Some of the staff members provided little to no customer service. I tried to make light conversation with the woman doing my eye tests, but it went ignored. I understand she needed to get her job done, but at least some sort of feedback would have been appreciated. Everything seemed rushed, but the wait felt eternal. I felt that for the amount of time patients were waiting past their appointment times (my appointment was at 3, but not seen until 20-25 min past) they should've at least given a heads up. I expect a wait at doctor's office, but I feel I've experience more time issues at this facility. I would suggest to allot more exam time for patients. For instance, I notice they give patients 10 minute time slots. I feel they should allow 15-20 minutes for patient exams. It's better to overestimate time & go under than giving little time & having people wait.

My hairstylist was Kylie and she did an AMAZING job! I came in with a picture of how I wanted my hair to look and got exactly what I wanted (which is a pretty rare feat at most salons I've gone to in the past). She was an attentive listener and very informative of my hair aftercare. I couldn't be more happier w/the way my ombré and haircut turned out. Her extensive experience and passion for her craftwork truly show in the phenomenal haircuts/color/ombré/blowouts she provides. I am definitely going back!

I ordered the potstickers, won ton soup, "Three Amigos", and house chow mein and all platters were delicious. The staff were both efficient and friendly. If one waiter was unavailable another was ready to assist. I also appreciated that staff was quick to clear the table after meals were finished. This way, there was enough space to pass around the platters and allotted plenty of elbow room to eat. I look forward to going back and enjoying another meal with my family here.

Great customer service and delicious food. I would definitely recommend coming in for lunch. If you're ordering for the office you can call the order ahead of time.

I want to commend this business on excellent customer service. From the receptionist to tech, service was top notch. I went in for a walk-in pedicure and the receptionist made me aware of a wait time due to some scheduled appointments, which I greatly appreciated. While my mom and I were waiting, he kept us updated on wait time and offered us waters. My wait time turned out to be less than 20 minutes where he then escorted my mom and I to the pedicure station. Although my mom was not getting any services, both the receptionist and tech went out of their way to put my mom in a comfy massage chair. It makes a big difference when businesses acknowledge and respect guests that come with you especially parents. Tina was my nail tech and she put the time and effort into the pedicure i.e. no sloppy polish work. I'm definitely coming back to this nail salon!

Went in with a group of 5 people around 10:30pm on Saturday night. For the late hour the restaurant wasn't packed except for a few scattered diners here and there. Even though our waiter had a nice personality, service was slow. Refills took forever, plus kept getting the wrong refills (originally ordered an iced tea but kept getting Coke even though it was pointed out). Also, one of the drinks came out w/a hair on the whip cream and our waiter caught it before setting it down on the table. Instead of getting a completely new drink, only the half of the hair whip was removed & more added on top causing the whip to melt all over the side of the mug. One of the coffee mugs was also dirty. I guess it's probably because we went late at night, but we witnessed a couple verbally fighting in the dining room. No attempt was made to ask the couple to step outside even though there were children around. I most likely will not go back to this location and/or this time at night.

Aside from the prices (my ticket cost $11.46, small drink $5+), the theatre is clean and comfortable. The cinema is definitely with the technological times since all the movie displays are on a screen that let you know when it's OK to go into the theatre. Also, everything is mostly self serve which is nice since you can just get your refills whenever.

Nate and Allyssa were our servers and they were really attentive to our needs. Everyone from the hostess to our servers had excellent customer service. We started with the fried calamari for appetizer and the breading was the perfect balance of crispness and seasoning. For food, we had the lobster with the medium trifecta sauce and catfish with a medium lemon pepper sauce bags plus a soft shell crab po boy sandwich. All the food was cooked to perfection. I can't wait to come back again!
