If I could give this place zero stars I would! I've been coming here for 4 years and it's gone down hill slowly but surely. Today was utter disappointment.   They gave my food to a table that literally had just been seated with menus in hand and I had already waited 20 minutes for my food to come out since placing my order. Also my waitress didn't check on me during that 20 minute time span. How do you not notice that one of your tables doesn't have anything but water and chopsticks?!   I shouldn't have to get up and ask where my order is. Nor should I have to wait an additional 10 minutes for my food to be made after you realized you gave it to the wrong person. They didn't even know they screwed up until I said something.   Taking care of a $7 sushi bill (it was happy hour) isn't exactly that great of an apology. Never mind the amount of food you wasted and cost you just made for yourself. Not sure how that equals profits for you guys. The manager didn't quite seem to feel too bad about what happened. She seemed rehearsed as if this happens often for her. What I don't understand is how that happened because it wasn't busy at all when I got there. From now on I'll take my business else where.   Tip: Hire competent and attentive staff and managers so stupid mistakes like this don't cost you loyal customers.

THE WORST SERVICE! If I could give it 0 stars I would! Employees don't care about people wanting to see products. They only care about people who are waiving their credit card around. I waited 20 minutes and had to ask for help twice and had to ask for a manager. And then they proceeded to act as if they were doing me a favor by showing me the product that was locked in the case. It's safe to say  I'll be buying my new MacBook and any other electronics straight from Apple or the manufactures website.

This is THE WORST resale store I've ever sold to. I brought in some very nice designer clothing and some nice one star clothes (forever21) as well as an expensive handbag. Well when I had asked the girl what items did they decide to purchase from me they told me one pair of shorts and my purse.    I asked how much for each item. My forever 21 shorts gave me $2.80 in cash, which was fine because its just forever21. However when it came to my Rebecca Minkoff MAC Mini crossbody bag they offered me another $2.80! Um excuse me?! That bag is $195 brand new and my bag was in GOOD condition. No scratches or huge stains or anything. That I find to be an insult. So I asked for my bag back and told them  they could take the shorts. Well one of the girls said okay and the other one gave me an attitude  while rolling her eyes at me and asking "how much do you want for the bag?" I said well you just told me $2.80 is all you can pay me for it so I want it back. She instead kept trying to pick a fight with me over how much I was willing to take for the bag. Last I checked it was still MY BAG. So I did what anyone else would do I took my purse back. The other girl gave me my $2.80 for my shorts and I left.    I've never been so disgusted with the rude customer service and the lack of knowledge those girls have for being a "fashion buyer" for a store that is based off of reselling goods for a profit. I will NEVER step foot in this store again and I hope people do question how much they are getting for their items because scamming people to make a profit isn't okay. Not sure how a designer leather hand bag in good condition is worth the same amount as last seasons forever 21 cut off shorts.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I made an appointment for a consultation a week ago on hair extensions. I specifically asked that it be with someone who knew how to do ethnic hair as I am mixed. I get there and the girl looking at my hair basically had no clue what to recommend for me and referred me to another stylist that wasn't in. So I go to the front desk to rebook a new consultation with the correct person only to call and confirm my appointment and discover it wasn't even booked. To have the nerve to ask me to come back AGAIN after you screwed me over the first two times and wasted my time isn't acceptable. Learn how to listen to your clients needs and requests and book appropriately and accurately. I wonder if they're just typical racist assholes who don't cater to mixed clientele or anything other than your average Scottsdale industry girl which would explain my poor experiences with them. So glad I didn't let anyone in this place touch my hair considering they can't even figure out their appointment book. I would stay far far away from this wannabe high end salon.

I am OBSESSED with this place. One of my friends referred me and I'm so glad he did! The staff is insanely friendly. Their app is easy to use and very convenient. The doctor I saw Dr. Riba was so helpful and really listened to me. She gave me hope and honestly a life changing visit because someone is finally figuring out what is making me so ill. I had detailed instructions for treatments and referrals as well as getting blood work for labs that were done in the same visit. I've never been more impressed with an office. Zero wait time and such an efficient and friendly office staff. I will never go anywhere else! Everyone should go see them!
