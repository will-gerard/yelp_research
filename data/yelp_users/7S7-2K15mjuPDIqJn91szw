"The Duck" as I like to call it never disappoints. This, as with all places downtown, gets pretty busy so I would recommend going earlier in the lunch hours. My two staple sandwiches are the fiery Italian (and it is) and a build my own with turkey and havarti. The fiery Italian is as it sounds, the usual Italian meats and cheese but it's their hot peppers that give it the extra something. Also, the quality of their products make it a much better sandwich than a lot of the other options in the area. The best part of the build my own is the champagne mustard. It's kind of like a honey mustard but possibly more delicious. If you are downtown and looking for a sandwich this is definitely the best option for quality and taste.

I had eaten at the old Scottsdale location of Oreganos many times. In order to have a larger building the old town location moved a while back. I gave the new building a few chances. I just can't continue to go there. The place is now such a cave. You can tell they did as little as possible to get the place open. But that's not what really sealed the deal. I actually have stopped going to Oreganos all together since they changed their pasta supplier. The new pasta has a terrible consistency and is very gummy. I had been going to Oreganos for about 15 years but the changes that have been made recently have stopped me from going to all locations. It's sad that it used to be my favorite restaurant but when they seem to have traded quality for profit it's no longer the place it used to be.

I recently tried Scratch for the first time. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 2. When we got there the restaurant was half full (it's a small place, maybe only 12 tables) and there were what seemed to be two servers wandering around. We stood there for a while before either of them acknowledge and seated us. The table still had the breakfast menus out and I had to hunt down lunch menus on my own. Eventually one of the servers came over and got us water. By this time we were already made to feel as though we had inconvenienced the staff by walking through their door. Eventually the server took our order. I had ordered an omelet with mushrooms and goat cheese and my husband had the burger. We waited for a while for our food and as we were sitting there the cooks were screaming in the kitchen and the servers were ignoring the customers. At one point the kitchen shouted "86 the goat cheese" and when my omelet arrived you knew they had run out since there was barely any in my omelet. My mushrooms also seemed not very fresh. My husband's burger was also incredibly over seasoned. It tasted like half meat half herbs. The only think we liked were their fries. Despite the food being subpar we ate as quickly as we could to get out of there, I have never felt so uncomfortable and unwanted in a restaurant. There is absolutely no way anyone could get me to go back.

Buzzberry may not be the best coffee joint out there but it does the trick and it never hurts to support local. The staff is generally friendly and pretty quick. If you like a large drink make sure you get the "secret menu" large.

First let's imagine its 1997, I have walked into a coffee shop with a bunch of angsty chicks listening to angsty chick music, but then you realize its 2014 and you're at One Coffee. Personally I enjoy the independent, as it should be, feel of this coffee shop. Good coffee, art on the wall and coffee shop type chicks serving it up. Now I keep mentioning chicks because seriously the only dude that works there is the owner.   So about the coffee: I like that all their choices are actually coffee and not just covered in whipped cream. One of my personal favorites it the caf√© miel, but mostly I get iced coffee and their coffee is good enough to stand on its own.  If you find yourself downtown: break free of the "you know what place I'm talking about" cycle, support local business and get yourself some better coffee.   **Oh, I can't forget one of my favorite parts. I enjoy their use of the square. Easy payment process and it remembers your email after the first time you use it so it tracks your "punch card" electronically so you don't have to carry anything around.

I eat here pretty often for lunch and I actually walk past 2 other Thai places on my way. Out of the downtown Thai options this place is definitely the best. The food is always good and the portions are a very good size. The only issues I have us that it is very difficult to get a hold of them by phone for to go orders and that their to go plastic ware is of very low quality. Despite those issues it is well worth going.

Chloe's Corner is one of my usual lunch spots, I go at least once or twice a week. To be honest the first time I went here I thought I'd never go back. I had the egg salad sandwich and was really not a fan. It was cheap bread and the egg salad had a bunch of "stuff" in it. But then one of my coworkers wanted to hit up the salad bar, and I was hooked. Now at the end there will be a large caveat to everything I am about to write. They have several "lettuce" options that are always crisp and many toppings to choose from. There are several protein choices, I personally enjoy tofu. They also have all the staples as well as extras like marinated artichokes. But the best part is their balsamic vinaigrette, it is amazing. Now with all that said, you have to get there before 11:30. When everything is first set out the salad bar is fantastic, but they don't keep up with it throughout the day. By noon there's food everywhere, all the dressings have dripped into each other and they are out of some of the stuff. Lucky for me I'm an early luncher.

When I read that this was an Aaron May restaurant I thought I'd give it a shot since my husband and I like Renegade (another of his restaurants). I had looked at the menu online and was excited to try it. When we first walked in I noticed the cool barstools. The server came up and led us to the patio. It was quiet and enclosed with a fireplace. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant, or maybe it's more of a bar, has a very large beer list. I however, ordered a manhattan. I could tell it's not something the bartender usually makes once I tried my drink. My husband and I started our meal with the wedge salad. It was ok, the bacon was a little odd. My husband then had the burger which he said was very juicy and that he liked it. I had the Korean fried chicken which could have been juicier. My chicken also came with a red wine vinegar slaw. I have had red wine vinegar slaw before that I have really enjoyed so I had high hopes, but this slaw had a flavor I couldn't place and I didn't like. The redeeming factor of the night was that the atmosphere was good and our server was very nice. I would go back for some beers with friends but I don't think I'd bother to order any food.

It had been a very long time since I had been to Matt's Big Breakfast. It had been since the other building, when to use the bathroom you went in a room in the motel next door (very creepy, but hey it added character). While I do appreciate a more normal bathroom situation there is just something about the new location that leaves me missing the old. That is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, maybe I'm too nostalgic. I can saw however, the wait time is greatly reduced by having the additional tables. I do also feel that the service is reduced by the addition of the tables. My husband had ordered the three egg special but it came out 10 minutes before my plate of food. I had ordered the ruben which was also very good but I asked for extra thousand island that never came. My cup sat empty waiting for more iced tea for the greater part of our meal. I will still always love Matt's Big Breakfast but it's just not the same.

I had never been to the original version of the pink pony but decided to check it out as the new revamped version. I cannot say with any certainty what they are going for now. From what I know of the old place it was Old Arizona.  A concept which I feel is worth hanging on to. I think they are now attempting to attract the young Scottsdale crowd but they didn't seem to capture that space. My husband and I were by far the young ones in there.   Our service was one of the worst parts. She was nice but not any good. She had no knowledge of the menu. I can't stand that. You work here, know your product. I would get fired from my job if I knew nothing about it. She also disappeared for a very long time so I had to hunt down someone else for ketchup for our fries and another soda.  The food itself was mediocre. I had the crispy chicken that wasn't crispy and my husband had the burger which was not a stand out.   Something else that I ALWAYS find to be an important way to know more about a restaurant is by visiting their bathroom. A truly good restaurant leaves no part of itself unattended. This place could have cared less. There was a soaking half used roll of toilet paper sitting on the vanity and crap all over the floor.   There was no part of my experience here that would ever make me go back.

I work downtown and I'm a very picky eater. In fact, I don't like pizza. Let's just say that I have a short list of places where I am willing to eat. This place recently opened and my coworkers and I made plans to check it out together. To my surprise I have a place to add to my list. DELICIOUS.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was stars was due to chaos. With this place being new, they haven't really gotten the "flow" down. There are several stations that can help take your order but it's hard to realize that's what's going on. There are people back and forth all over the place trying to figure it all out, customers and employees. There is also not a good place to wait while they cook your pizza so everyone in passing is jamming through the people waiting.   Anyhow, let's talk food. You can order on of their predetermined pizzas for a few bucks less that the "make your own". Spend your few bucks people because they have CHOICES!. Four crusts, just as many sauces and cheeses, and piles of toppings. They even have some after items like balsamic glaze. I had gotten the rosemary crust with tomato and pesto sauce. I piled it high with things like artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, and caramelized onions. I did also go for that balsamic glaze at the end. It was all sorts of interesting and great toppings that it was almost not like pizza.   I'm sure this place will get better as the workforce and its customer base get better at the ordering processes. I would definitely say that if you work downtown this is a definite "add to the rotation" place.

The most important place to start: There is a restaurant that has been across the street for a long time with a great record serving up a very similar menu and doing it better. If you have been to this place I speak of across the street, and you like it, don't go to Paul Martin's.   This is a new location for an already established restaurant group, for that reason I do not allow the excuse of being new in regards to our not so great service. While our waitress was nice, she just wasn't very good. If I ask you what items are good on the menu don't tell me what people have been ordering a lot of that night. It doesn't answer my question. A restaurant like this should have had all their employees do a complete tasting of their menu.   After lack of guidance my husband and I collectively wound up with the spinach dip, mushroom soup, steak cobb salad and the short ribs. The meal itself started with olives from the Queen Creek Olive Mill and some seasoned almonds. We enjoyed those and thought we were headed on the path of a good meal, but not so much. Next our waitress brought us "complimentary" bread. She kept saying "complimentary ". It was weird, pretty sure everyone eating at that restaurant understands when the bread hits the table you don't have to pay for it. Anyhow, it wasn't very good bread.   Next should have been our spinach dip but that took 25 minutes so my soup showed up first. It would have actually been very good but half the bowl was filled with a chunk of that not so great bread wedged into my soup. Finally the "spinach dip" came. Ok, if you have had that aforementioned restaurant's spinach dip, DO NOT ORDER THIS. It was whole leaves of spinach that were wilted in a runny b√©chamel sauce. Not only was the flavor lacking but it was hard to eat since it was whole leaves of spinach. Don't waste your time or money on that one.  The last round for us was my salad and my husband's short ribs. My salad was ok, not bad - but nothing to write home about. The price for what you were getting left something to be desired though. My husband's short ribs were a little bit of short ribs and 20 potatoes worth of mashed potatoes. Guess they make sure their margins are good on that dish. But the biggest issue there was the "sauce". The meat itself was very tender but the plate was like soup with a broth made of soy sauce with meat floating in it. This quantity of soy sauce made the short ribs SO over salted. Short ribs have become very popular on many restaurant menus lately and these were probably my least favorite out of many I've tried lately.   One of the most important things to note here, the bathrooms were FILTHY. I always find it concerning when cleanliness is not a priority in any part of a restaurant.   Final statement: go across the street.
