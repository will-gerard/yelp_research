The wings awe amazing. Make sure to get them double dipped! (It's fried wings, dipped then grilled then dipped again) BUT that beijg said, their take out is horrendous. They'll quote you 20min. Don't show up for 45 min to an hour because that's how long your order will take to be ready. Third time in a row that happened. I walked in at the 20 min mark as the cook was putting my wings into the fryer. Half an hour later, after sitting there my order was finally ready.

Been coming here for years. The staff is friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty as hell. Awesome Mexican food, and great location; it's close to everything in Old Town.

We've been here multiple times and although my boyfriend always gets the tuna, I've tried something new every time. This tuna sandwich is the best in Phoenix. Idk what the put in the mix but it's amazing. So far my favorites are the Suzie Q with bacon, and the Cuban. Everything is amazing, all the way down to their fries. We try to come here once a week, and I take all my friends who haven't had it before. Great mom and pop sandwich shop, with very reasonable prices.

I've been coming here for years I finally was in old Town again and stopped in for dinner. The food I had was subpar. The $30 steak was barely a flat iron quality. Denny's probably has better quality meat. The pasta with meatballs was practically ketchup with some pepper. I used to come in and have the hanger steak or the pork chop and hang out with wine. I'll never come here again. This place has become a poster child for kitchen nightmares. The chef needs to get his shit together especially for old Town quality dining.

Love this place. I lived in Japan and I love to come here to reminisce about the region. They have a great range of indegrients and are super friendly. Last time I was here I had a big bowl of ramen and tempura side. The tempura wasn't cold when it was fried so it was a tad chewy. The portions are huge and bug enough to share, but I never do. :)

***Only here for happy hour*** first time here tonight was for happy hour. Pretty good atmosphere, drinks were good. Service was friendly. Some of the people in our group had food, which looked good. I'd come here again for some drinks before dinner or to meet up with coworkers. Next time I'll eat!

I am a huge fan of the Cafe Rio franchise but this one is horrible. I've been in twice, since moving to the area and both times they disappointed me. This time was unacceptable though leaving me not able to finish my meal.   I come in frequently to the Gilbert location because it's near my work,so I know what sides and extras come with meals. At this location you need to ask if you want ANYTHING. They try to rush you through the line, and if you ask for anything the workers roll their eyes and are inconvenienced.   I was ordering for my family and didn't notice the missing items until I got back to my house. I did catch one thing in line. I ordered two tacos, and instead of asking if I wanted pico, she just started wrapping the tacos up. I asked for pico and she rolled her eyes and that's when I noticed the container was empty! She didn't want to walk back and get a new one! So instead she just decided I wasn't going to get any. I insisted and she went back and got me some.   I get home, with my tortilla soup, missing half the ingredients, and my two tacos and two tosadas. I take a bite from my taco, and pull a foot long black hair out of my mouth. Needless to say I didn't finish my meal, which brings their cleanliness into question considering when I was getting my beverage, the brewed tea dispensers were open to the world. Disgusting.   Management obviously needs to step it up at this location because if it's happening to me it's happening to others. And, after reading the reviews my complaints are the same as others and not being addressed.

We had our company's holiday party here, and the service was AMAZING! The ladies were always there to help us and refill our drinks! We had a group of about 30 and they gave us the entire patio! So nice.   The food was a little lack luster though. The Mac & Cheese Balls needed flavor and the pita "nachos" were good, but had way too much humus on them.   We didn't order any enters, so I can't really give an all around review, but from what I experienced I would definitely come back by myself, or schedule another event there.

My sister and I went to watch the game last night and we had a great time. Service was really attentive and the food was good.   The style and decor was cure, and fit the trendy area well. The menu had several things go to choose from and was easy to navigate.   We got a pizza, Mac and cheese and some wings. We tried some of the sauces and everything was pretty good! I'd definitely come back. Reasonable prices good quality if food. My only complaint was our pizza crust wasn't crisp. It was just a tad too doughy.

Great fun drinks. Truly a place where the flavor of the alcohol influences the mixology. Haven't been able to try the food yet, but looking forward to it! B&T trying to raise the bar of mixed beverages, and I think they are accomplishing it one drink at a time. :) sat at the bar and the mixologist was very busy, but that gave me time to enjoy my cocktail. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. I will be coming back at least once a week. I wrote this great review then got home and realized sitting at the bar totally destroyed not only my shoes by my boyfriends shoes as well. Picture attached. I'm really disappointed. How could resting your feet in the brass rail cut your shoes so badly?

Great food and amazing service. The ambiance was a little lackluster but I would prefer great food over ambiance any day. We had a friends birthday dinner here and everything we ordered was cooked and seasoned very well. Food arrived quickly and we were checked in on frequently. I would come back again and recommend this place to anyone.

Came here for my brothers birthday on a recommendation from a friend. Boy was I glad we made reservations!   The decor and ambience of Semo Maya is fine modern and engaging. The tree in the center of the restaurant is an awesome idea. Great place to meet up anytime of the day.   Although all the drinks on the menu looked amazing, we only ordered two, and they definitely didn't disappoint. So yummy!   I was really confused when the waitress explaind the menu as "tapas" style. Definitely confusing because when she explaind it further it sounded more like and "ala carte" style, which is exactly what it was! And although confusing the service was so amazing. Totally accommodating and fun.   Every dish I tried was on point except the Pork al Pastor Pad Thai. I was expecting to have a hint of pineapple or a nod to the peanuts. Not the case. Although good, it had neither and left me feeling disappointed.   All in all the food was amazing, service nice and warm, and drinks well made. 4 stars for the entire expirence but not 5 because of the convoluted explanation of the menu and disappointment with the Pad Thai.   TLDR: Food amazing, explination of menu confusing, order many things you won't regret it.

Service was amazing, cute ambience. Definitely on par with the Arcadia neighborhood, but the food left me wanting more. I'm giving it a second chance and once I come back I'll edit my review.
