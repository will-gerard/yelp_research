Perry has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years.  Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I ask?  The  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service.

This might fall under the category of "too much Information" but...  In the last two weeks I've been in 4 meetings catered by Qdoba and an hour or so after each meal I've had the worst indigestion. Wow, how do I spell r-e-l-i-e-f??? I need some now. I hope no one in the cubes outside my office can hear the belching or they will think I've been swilling brewskis at lunch. The first time I thought might be an anomaly, but today was the 4th...buuuuurp...lunch and...buuuurp....there it goes again.

A real trip - back in time! The "old world" alpine chalet decor is honest enough to be cute in it's cheesy-ness, especially with the addition of the heavily-accented (Danish, I assume) ladies behind the counter.  The dogs are excellent. A sign says you must request that your dog be grilled (I assumed that meant your dog is boiled otherwise), but I made no such request and my Jumbo came out perfectly grilled with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside, juiciness on the inside. The tuna salad-stuffed tomato was also tasty as was the potato salad. Nothing cut tinge edge or creative here - just good, solid, traditional tastiness.

Opera is Fun! Yes it is!  Tosca yesterday was amazing! I was riveted through the whole thing - and at almost 4 hours (including 2 intermissions), that's saying something. I was wowed by the singing, enjoyed the sets, was impressed by the acting, and intrigued by the story. Floria Tosca was superb, Scarpia and Spoletto deliciously evil. Honestly, I did not expect to LIKE opera as much as I have, but I've been enthralled with both AZ Opera performances I've seen this year (The Mikado and Tosca), particularly Tosca.  After the performance an opera Q&A session was held for anyone wishing to stay. The AZ opera head and tenor James Flora answered questions about everything from the set, the director's mindset, the Spoletto character's triumphant ending, and the future of opera in the United States.

Above and Beyond Service   One morning I ordered an Americano, and when I got to the counter to pick up my drink, I realized that I forgot to order the piadini I had wanted, and the line was too long to go back through. The barista must have noticed my heavy sigh, asked what was wrong, and I explained.  She stepped away from the coffee machine and returned minutes later with a piadini "take care of it next time and have a great day" she said.  Wow.  That has NEVER happened to me anywhere!  (I did pay for it the next time).    A couple  weeks ago, I ordered an Americano and piadini at the drive thru (yes, I can be a creature of habit), and when I got to the window they told me the total I owed  - it was so low that I said "you must have forgotten my piadini"  They had the piadini ready for me but had not rung it up, so they told me it was on the house.  Wow.    Earlier this evening I stopped in for a coffee and as always received quick, friendly and professional service.  Many other Starbucks are staffed by teenagers about as excited to serve me as they are to do court-ordered community service.  Not at 16th and Bethany - these people seem genuinely happy I've stoppped in and want me to return.  Kudos to the staff!

Convenience is about the best thing I can say about Danny's, as they are in a handy location for me and are quick. OK, the outside of my car generally looks pretty good after a wash here, but hey - it's a compact without any trim, so the average high school fundraiser car wash could achieve that... it's the inside job that always disappoints. I think they do only a cursory pass over the large surface areas inside, as the nooks, crannies, corners and edges never seem to get cleaned. Other than shining the tires, the "Works" wash gives the same results as the "Basics" wash - think twice before spending the extra bucks.

Had their Italian sub for lunch yesterday. Haven't been there for awhile for anything but grocery items, probably because sandwiches don't really turn my crank. The Italian sub was however quite fresh and tasty, and the owners are always enthusiastic. I would go three stars as a "restaurant", but upped to 4 because of the nice imported grocery items. Italian cheeses, candies, and all sorts of packaged stuff. Great lady finders for tiramisu. They have some good frozen pasta too, though you have to ask about them.  If you eat their sandwich in your office, throw the wrappings in someone else's wastebasket.  A day later mine still smells like vinegar and peperocini.

Oh jeez I hate it when spring roles around and the drive through starts to smell... If you go to the drive through, be ready to keep your windows up because the grease box in the back STINKS... ugh - going through in a convertible to satisfy my oreo blizzard jones was enough to ruin my appetite.   Service is OK except in two cases, which unfortunately happen often: 1) a crowd of people inside; or 2) some in front at the drive through ordering multiple items.   To be fair, all the ice cream items (why order anything else at DQ?) are fine, as good as any other DQ. But the outside stench at the drive through and slow service limit me to only two stars.

Great business lunch place! Atmosphere is as described in other reviews - cozy upscale - and the coziness is just right for a business lunch. The booths have plenty of space for laying out notes, etc., without being cramped.  The sound level is perfect - easy to hear your companions (unlike Richardson's), yet muted enough that people at the next table don't hear everything. Also, it's sophisticated enough to avoid the "date" atmosphere so dreaded in a business lunch locale.  Tasty choices for all palates, though vegetarian selections are pretty much limited to some salads. I've tried to hit the happy hour a few times but the happy hour prices are limited to those seated at the hard-to-get bar seats.  If you are not there early, don't plan on the happy hour deals.

A summary of the high points - Better quality than other consignment places, nice staff, decent cash and credit for what you consign, great prices, especially for the "bridge" brands like Ellen Tracy, Jones NY, etc.  I got a spectacular Ellen Tracy blazer for $8.  A CAbi blouse for $7.  Ann Taylor blazer for $11.  The real designer duds are of course $100+, but still a tiny fraction of the retail price.  Low points - the place is weirdly organized, and the selection of larger sizes is pretty small.  I still haven't  figured out why there are three or four racks of jeans and several racks of blouses in different locations, and no racks of dresses...  well I'm sure there is one, but it's not anywhere obvious.  Also, the clothes on the designer racks are jammed too closely together and not separated by size, which makes browsing that rack so difficult I usually give up.  Also, they don't notify you when your clothes have sold, so remember to check in.

The bone in rib eye keeps me coming back... juicy, tender, crispy-fatty and with intense steak taste, they always make me fat and happy. The other cuts (which my husband orders for some unknown reason, and I try) are good but aren't the standouts like the rib eye. It's all about the beef here, and if that's not what you are seeking, you'll be left wondering what the fuss is about.   I know, it's a chain, it's as un-hip as it comes, but some days the dark "good ol' boys" atmosphere is perfect for tucking oneself away in a booth and devouring a hunk of beef and bottle of wine. There are simply times when it feels good to just be part of the middle-aged crowd and treated like a grown up. Heck, mid 40s is downright YOUNG here!   At the bar, a sliced NY strip is available, which the husband and I sometimes share. Many think the bar is too small, but if you come early it's usually almost empty, the martini selection is great, and the bartenders are personable.   Service runs from good to excellent. last night my husband ordered a glass of Australian zin that was so oaky if was like licking a board. The server observed that the wine wasn't being enjoyed and insisted on taking it off the bill despite our insisting that we 9ok, my hubby) chose, so we're happy to pay for it. they brought us a taste of an alternative which was very tasty (and not over-oaked, indicating 1) we should have asked them for advice; and 2) they know their wines, but selected a couple nice glasses of port instead.   Another big selling point is the AMC theater upstairs, a perfect place to sit and let the food and wine metabolize before driving home.

Don't they read their Yelp reviews? I too had trouble getting waited on last weekend and this isn't the first time. The place was exactly as described by Bri..and after wading through the net surfers and congestion I finally managed to snag a 15 year-old sales person...only to find out by her frustrated response that her color T-shirt does not do sales, it means she is some type of tech support (oooo - haughty - am I supposed to bow?) and I need to find someone in the orange, or lime or tangerine or whatever T-shirt.   So I find Orange T-shirt who proceeds to reprimand me for having the audacity to want to buy an iphone without standing in the iphone line (what line? I see no line. That's why I stopped in today, not last week, because today there is no line).   Stopped short by my pointing out the line does not exist, Orange T then quizzes me about doing my pre-authorization...I haven't done it yet? Well, I'm welcome to sit in the store and enter my personal data amongst all the hovering net surfer losers. Time to make my escape, call ATT and have the darn thing ordered over the phone in less time than I spent navigating the color coded T-shirt brigade at the iStore. Whew.

Breakfast is my favorite at LGO, especially very early when there is still seating and parking. This morning reading my paper over poached eggs, I realized the crowd is starting to wear on me - some guy at the next table was loudly pontificating about " and then Senator So-And-So told me...", while the hard body bikers glided past, and a couple of Angelina Jolie clones with tousled just-out-of-bed hair, pucci-style (or real?) sundresses slinked in...if you look like like me in the morning (a poor schlump lucky to get her shirt on right side out - maybe), definitely gird your self-esteem before braving the LGO morning crowd.  Ok, I still love the food, the outdoor seating, and the cool knickknacks; so being rather thick skinned about my schlumpiness, I continue to go. But jeez I'm gonna puke if I hear any more Senator So-and-So conversations.

Yes indeed, this is good as it gets!  After discovering Marcellino's a few years ago, I am now drawn there like a magnet.  Marcellino is a "real" chef, personally designing each menu item..and the off-menu items, which change regularly, are his masterpieces.   The atmosphere is unique to Phoenix - high class, personal, and sophisticated yet cozy.  This is a place for food, wine and conversation, not a see-and-be-seen joint.  That said, I've seen and met some of the Valley's movers and shakers here - business owners, politicians, artists, TV personalities, politicians.  The service is consistently top-notch and professional.  Family owned and operated, Marcellino and Sima pour their heart into this place, and it shows.

Do you know what "scampi" really is?  I learned new food fact at Marcellino this week, something I should have known, but most of us probably don't. "Scampi" is an animal - a type of lobster that looks a lot like a shrimp. I've always assumed "scampi" was the shrimp in butter and garlic dish, but it turns out that is an American bastardization of the term. Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along. BTW, Marcellino's REAL scampi is lovely, served grilled "on the half shell". Plan on sucking all the tasty bits off the shell.

So much for the Starbuck's coffee at Veranda. As of this week they've replaced it with some wimpy Folger's-syle stuff. Humpf. I guess everybody is trying to cut costs in this economy, but they've just eliminated the main draw for me in the morning. because my office lunchroom coffee tastes better than their new stuff. Woe is me...

Lickety-split, it seems I'm always in and out of this place in a jiffy. Why review a UPS Store??  Aren't they all alike??  Absolutely not.  The 16th St and Glendale Store keeps addresses stored on their computer so I just give them my phone number, tell them to whom I am shipping, and (assuming it's a repeat destination), and out comes the shipping form - no messy forms. I think most UPS stores have this capability, but many don't bother. Also, they are diligent about sending a status email so I can track the package.   Aside from the holidays, it's usually one of the same two guys in there and they are efficient, understand what to do with international addresses, and are kind and courteous. The few times there is a line, they always apologize for the wait and obviously try to be as speedy as possible. Overall, they act and operate like they WANT my business and appreciate it. That's why I keep coming back, forsaking all others (UPS Stores that is).

I'm off to Elle Nails in a minute... Fair prices, clean facility, nice staff.  One thing I really like about this place is the openness - the shop is double sized, which decreases the wait time and also tames the ubiquitous chemical smell - while the smell is present, it's really mild.  Even my good friend from St. Paul who frequents only tony "upscale" nail boutiques was impressed.  For an extra $5 they will use a callous remover solution on your heels - well worth it if you get the hard, cracked, heels like I have.  They also have a mango-sugar leg rub for an extra fee, but I think the regular treatment works just as well. Many of the technicians speak little or no English, so don't expect to make complicated requests.

For honesty, 5 big-ass stars.  There ARE honest mechanics. Took my car in this morning to ask for an estimate to replace my brakes which have been screeching to high heaven. They took a look and told me I probably have 20K miles left before I'll need them replaced; it's just the pad compound that makes a lot of noise. Since I only have only 24K miles on the current brakes, this made me quite happy. They gave me their car "for when you really do need us".

Open early, open late - 6am to 10pm on weekdays, which is so handy-dandy for us workaholics. For this reason alone I could not go anywhere else, as up until this recession thingy my life has been all about how to get life done while working a gazzillion hours. That said - I've been a Suntown regular for 9 years (anything that CAN be dry cleaned DOES get dry cleaned) with overall consistently good results. The husband has had a few buttons ruined and a couple times had an errant staple in his shirt (???), but the problems are limited to 1-2% of the total items we bring in, so I can live with that. Because of those hours. Dreamy.

Usually only to "the trade", I always wondered what was in the  unobtrusive, modern concrete building on Central Ave near Bombero's. My eyes were opened at the first Sunnyslope Art Walk when their doors were opened to the public. A stunning array of modern home decor (wall art, tables, pots, vases, etc.) items with a slightly industrial, ever so very slightly rustic flavor. Updated but not trendy, classy yet with a  little edge.  And big.  Most of the pieces are scaled for large spaces.  The decor theme is coherent in terms of colors, materials and shapes. The gallery is not like a home decor store with something of every style - the shapes, colors and look are all in the same theme. This of course means if that if you are looking for colonial, Tuscan, frontier, retro-mod, or anything outside of their scope, you won't find it here. Personally, I could do my whole house in their stuff if I had the money and ceiling height.   At the last Sunnyslope Art Walk they sold directly to the public for that evening only. We got a couple gorgeous, large planter pots to put outside our front door. We got a reasonable price and the folks who helped us were just plain nice people with whom to deal.

I buy ingredients here, and a few splurge snack items, not regular grocery runs, prepared foods, or wine, so take this review from that frame of reference... Today I needed ingredients for baking, including King Arthur flour (only one I'll use), rye flour, ww flour, yeast, baking powder & baking soda.  An example of why I like WF - they carry King Arthur, and they have other flours (a huge variety -rye, barley, potato, soy, you name it) in small bags!  Yeah!  No more tossing 3 lbs of rye flour because I haven't used it in months.  I needed anchovies for making salad dressing - they have a nice choice from $3.00 to $12.00.  Need some juice... check, nice selection. W ant a nice cheese to munch on the drive home... got it.  No, the cheese isn't cheap, but when i'm craving a good one I'll pay a buck more rather than run over to TJs.    It seems whenever I'm doing a special dinner and want specialty, high quality ingredients, I go to WF first, and usually leave with everything i need. I've had no problem with anything being out of stock.  The downers?  The lack of some "normal" thinks I'd like to pick up whole there, i.e. those toilet scrub sponges on a stick; hit or miss produce quality; terrible parking lot for maneuvering when it's full; and an over abundance of snotty customers.  Hardly anyone says "excuse me" when the want to get by (they just shove or tailgate me with their cart), or says 'thank you" when I move to let them access the same shelf at which I'm looking.... very different from my local F&E where people are generally much more courteous and friendly, albeit not nearly as well dressed.

About 15 years ago, when I lived in rural AZ, I spent a lot of time in hotels in PHX for work, and some friends in Scottsdale dogsat my dog Heike while  I was in town.  Turns out their neighbor was Dr. Rick Sampson of Shea Animal Hospital, and Heike loved him.  When I moved to PHX, I chose Dr. Sampson, seeing as how he and Heike already knew each other on a "social" basis.  After years of care, and Dr. Sampson helping us through her last days, I'm still a huge fan of Shea Animal Hospital and take my two dogs there regularly.  The staff is genuinely nice, and care about the animals and owners.  I wasn't the only one crying when Heike passed away.  They are very good about discussiong the pors and cons of various procedures (including cost versus benefit), why they are recommending certain actions, and the consequences of different alternatives.  Over the years I've recommended them to at least three other friends in the area, and all are now long-time satisfied clients.  Best of all - I trust them.

I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.  The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here.

I love, love, love that Sky Harbor is located IN Phoenix!!  That's right, unlike the Denver Airport which is located almost in Wyoming, the Cincinnati airport, which is in a different state, or JFK which offers helicopter service from the airport to the city ....  The PHX airport is IN PHX.  Great for visitors flying in, or for Phoenicians flying out.   Food options are decent (except in Terminal 2, but the convenience of tiny Terminal 2 is a blessing in itself), parking is generally easy.  Baggage carrousels are well marked.  What I don't get is why it takes so long to get bags from the planes to the baggage claim - after all the  place is fairly compact.  At least the drive home from the airport is quick

I like steak. After wanting to try this place for years, I had the open face steak sandwich yesterday for lunch. When it arrived I thought ok, I'm taking half of this home. Yeah, right, good luck with that one Anne ol' girl, as I licked the last of the juices off my plate. Onion rings, slaw, pickle...all good but a waste of stomach space compared to the meat. My associates both had the prime rib sandwich and loved it.  The atmosphere is completely old school, and the crowd was mostly men who, from the sounds of the conversation, are in the construction/mining/manufacturing/heavy equipment industries. I can't wait to go back for dinner - maybe take the light rail.

Mediocre tacos.  I'll have to come back for the baked goods and see if they can earn more stars from me. Ended up there for lunch because some colleagues and I had a break from a training class and it was close. I was hoping to make a great find, but alas, they didn't impress. I figured a classic carne asado taco dinner would be a good barometer for gauging the place. The corn tortillas - now those were 5-star. the carne asada was so-so seasoned, not bad flavor, but somewhat bland, and quite tough. The mass of shredded lettuce on the tacos did nothing for it except make the lovely tortillas a bit soggy. Same for the blob of guacamole on the tacos. OK, but but so unpromising that I won't bother coming back for another meal. The baked goods on the other hand, I'll be back to try.

It's in Phoenix. Despite the loss of Vintage Market, 3-Dog Bakery, Ayako, and Coffee Plantation - before which I would have gone for 5 stars - it's in Phoenix and generally a safe and comfortable place to wander about. And dog friendly! And with a Borders. And an Apple Store. But mostly I'm a fan because it's the closest thing we have to a retail center anywhere near central Phoenix. Also, it has the only Macy's shoe department in the north valley that isn't a disorganized zoo. Would love to see more independents in there.

Pet friendly is one thing I've always like about the Biltmore, but things are getting out of hand.  In the last two weeks I've see people there with: 1) a wolf.  Honestly - I don't think it's a wolf/dog mix, I think that thing is a wolf; 2) a ferret.  In a pink sweater no less.  On a leash skittering around the ground and going into Teavana.  Yuck.  3) Parrots.  A gentleman was eating outside (thank goodness) at Paradise bakery with two parrot perched on his knees.  Made me hope no one decided to bring their cat with them...

I had the best lunch ever in the history of lunches at Da Vang today!  So many nice things have  been said about Da Vang in other reviews, so I won't repeat the details, except that it is good, fresh, and cheap.  Every time, without fail.  I've been there often, and just realized today that I hadn't reviewed it.  Atmosphere?  It's a room with some tables, no frills, but who cares?  Service is purely functional, no chit-chat or pleasantries - fine with me.  Bring on the pho, or rice stick noodles or stew, or .....drum roll please... the rice soup with fish.  That's menu item 61B.  They use lemon grass in it, and must put in a pound of lovely, perfectly cooked cod.  It's heavenly, and takes a little longer than most items to make so be prepared.

I love the traditional Mexican food here.  Try every variety of taco they have - I'll bet you've never tasted tongue so good!  Seriously, the lengua taco is really tasty, as are all the other varieties. Don't be shy.  The carne asada is the traditional streeet taco style and won't dissappoint.  The barbacoa is excellent too, just close your eyes and ignore the psychedelic pink color.  The flan is homemade, and excellent.  Prices are more than fair, and service is quick.  They serve beer and maragaritas (I don't know what else).  Maria, the owner is always friendly and will remember you if she sees you a  few times. The only bad thing about this place is the incessant parade of panhandlers through the parking lot and the outdoor patio.  I eat outdoors whenever the weather is remotely tolerable (a byproduct of growing up in Minnesota where you can eat outside about one day a year between the snow and mosquito seasons), but am sick and tired of being harassed by red-eyed, toothless meth-heads.  And I don't come here after dark - same reason.  Thank goodness it is staying light later now that spring is here, because the food is really good.

I really expected better! And I've HAD way better from Roy's in the past. The Ahi poki starter was fine, although spicy enough to drown out the side portion of Tobiko caviar, which was a shame. The Sunrise at Haleakala role - a delectable sounding roll of salmon, aji, hamachi, and asparagus, was a disappointment due poor "tempura" frying of the whole roll. The batter was more like a fish fillet batter than a tempura, and too greasy. The overwhelming taste was fried batter, not fish. The scallops encrusted in foie gras were ok, but not the standouts for which I had hoped. The accompanying blackberry plum reduction was too fruity and sweet to complement the scallops. The dish included 5 giant scallops - I would have preferred fewer and better.   Service started out almost oppressively attentive and dwindled to virtually nothing (except water refills) by dessert. We waited about 20 minutes for someone to show up so we could ask for the check. The server was stumped by my question about if they have a chardonnay that is not oaky. He pointed out that one that was "buttery but not oaky"... hmmm, he needs a wine 101 lesson. And of course described the "artesian" vanilla ice cream. Again hmmm...can't say I've ever seen vanilla ice cream spurting from the ground under pressure. A forgivable error, but another indicator that the it's no 'pro" service.   This food and service at a Bahama Breeze would get 3 stars, but at Roy's?? I really expected better.

Great place IF you are prepared. My strategy: 1) Go only when not rushed  2) Never have a particular goal in mind (i.e., a short -sleeved empire-waste blouse) - that's a recipe for dissappointment 3) Try on brands at Nordstrom whenever possible - it make shopping at Last Chance a lot easier - hey! the Garfield and Marks pants in my size!  cool! 4) Visit frequently and don't feel obligated to search the entire store at each visit.  Usually I do shoes and clothes in separate visits. (remember, I live close) 5) Take the whole thing in stride - think of it as a cultural experience.  And yes, like many others, I could list a gazillion fabulous, unbelievable deals I've gotten there.  My collection of Pliner shoes and boots, and a couple leather coats (retail $700, Last Chance for $30) being my favorites.  It's a great place to take visiting friends/relatives if they are bargain hunters.

I've had consistently good stuff here. Frankly, I usually shun "Mexican" places that are anything but traditional, and consider "southwestern" style as death knell for my tastebuds... but Sierra Bonita has overcome all that. Items I really like are the guacamole (very chunky avocado), fish tacos, bacon wrapped beef (they had achieved the elusive goal of getting the bacon crispy without overcooking the shrimp), the pork lion enchiladas (offered sometimes as specials) and burgers. No culinary breakthroughs here, but always pleasing.   My colleague commented that his pork enchiladas were $11, came with no sides, and still left him hungry. While I think prices are reasonable for the quality, those with a large appetite may be looking at $15.00 or more for a meal.

PULL THE CAR OVER NOW!!! That's what my dear husband hears whenever we drive by Tammie Coe.  The first time I tried her cakes was right before our wedding 3 years ago, and I called and BEGGED her to do my cake and she squeezed it in despite her already booked schedule.  I love the cakes..the zebra, bananas foster, lemon...  They look lovely and are filled with top-qaulity ingrdients (Tammie went over them all with me).  Her buttercream, which also sits atop the lucious ooey gooey cupcakes, is JUST LIKE my mom made as a kid...butter, sugar and cream.  yum.  one point of note - the Ooey Gooey cupcakes are NOT filled with anything gooey.  They are dark chocolate cake with buttercream frosting.   MJ Breads, while not as tantalizing to my over-developed sweet tooth, are some of the best breads I've found in PHX - very European style with crisp and chewy crust and light and puffy insides.  If you are not a chewy crust kinda person, don't even sink your teeth in.  If you've ever wondered where to get baguettes like the ones you had in France, this is it.

Such pretty things, all the shiny baubles. Being only a sporadic, recreational beader, I like Bead World best of all the 7 or 8 beads shops I've visited in the valley because 1) it's close. Every other shop is in out in the 'burbs; 2) nice selection of real stones, including large chunky stuff and many of pearls from dirt cheap to luxury: 3) it's small enough to have a personal feel, not the warehouse feel like at D&I or Beads Galore; 4) the staff are helpful and will give you one-on-one attention; 5) they are open Sundays; and 6) they have great classes! Not cheap (but they give a great discount coupon for beads afterwards), but very useful. I've taken most of the basic classes and actually learned stuff.   Bead World has a decent selection of single large beads, which saves a lot of money of you only want a few instead of a whole strand. The selection of man-made material beads (glass, etc) is pretty small - if you are looking for those, better to try elsewhere

Shockingly good for a hotel restaurant.. heck,  it's dang good for any restaurant!  We started out with the hamachi ceviche which had just the right amount of citrus - tangy but not too acid - and fantastic texture and flavor.  Could have eaten a bucket of that.  The mango "muddle" was similar to a mojito and tasted wonderful.  The bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese empanada were both very pleasing, though though not mind-blowing - I'd be happy to have ether again.  The duck breast on the other hand was indeed mind blowing!  Perfectly cooked (I asked the done-ness to be however the chef recommends), tender and fabulous.  The accompanying poached pear and quince were extraneous - I thought they detracted from the duck rather than enhancing it - but no matter, the duck was fine as can be without them.  The tiny bit of fois gras was delectable - more fois instead of the pear and quince might be even better.  My companions devoured the rack of lamb and a special request vegetarian dish with similarly rave reviews.  The chocolate cigar for dessert was perfect - the cigar is like a luxury Hostess Ho-Ho.. chocolate over a chocolate cake/white filling roll...  but believe me this ain't no Ho-Ho.  We shared it but I could have eaten the wHo-Hole thing (I could not resist the pun).  The accompanying mousse-like item (what WAS that thing?) was both light and rich, creamy and silky... and lovely.  Not quite top notch aspects included the wine-by the glass list - very limited - only approximately 7 or 8 choices each of whites and reds, none of which excited me.  The bottle list was longer, but come on, this is the age of Sheriff Joe and the DUI task force and  the by-the-glass option is critical in my opinion.  Service was ok, but nowhere near the quality level of the food.  The server's descriptions of the food was a somewhat haphazard.  Napkins did not get folded when someone stepped away from the table.  In fact, when several of us used the restroom before dessert was delivered, the busser absconded with our napkins and we were left to tackle the chocolate cigar sans napkins.  Before we ordered we asked if the bill could be split between two couples, and were assured this was fine.  Yet we received a single bill and when we requested it be split she asked us to mark which items goes on whose bill.  What a shame to have this detraction from an otherwise spectacular meal.

guys wearing sports jerseys, beaters, and baseball caps on backwards yelling "YEEEAH!", etc.... oh Lord, save me... WHAT was I thinking allowing the hubby to talk me into lunch here on a lovely summer afternoon??? OK,OK, I admit I found my self thinking that my reaction was a bit snobby (maybe it's my age....?) but yuck, who wants to yell over the televisions to talk to the person next to you?? I'm tellin' ya, they are loud.   Food-wise, I should have stuck to typical bar food and maybe I would have had better luck, because the big pretzel was tasty; traditional chewy with coarse salt. The salad with tri-tips was a dissappointment...actually the salad part was fine - fresh romaine and avocado, but the tri-tip was dry and tough and the balsamic dressing on the side was an overly-sweet, gelatinous blob (truly weird). As the hubby pointed out, what was I thinking ordering salad at a sports bar??   If you are really looking to watch TV sports and drink beer... I guess this place would be fine. For LUNCH...waaaay better choices out here.

For a place that doesn't hit any of my usual culinary hot buttons (ethnic, superb quality, fine wine list, creative) ... I still have to say that I do like Corbin's. Went there tonight after an unexplained hiatus of a few months (I was on hiatus, not Corbin's), and I realized that dinner was good, the previous lunches and dinners were good, service was good, atmosphere is good... and heck, while "good" isn't fabulous, it ain't bad!   The burgers here are always a safe choice and all the varieties I've tried are tasty. The pizza thingies aren't my bag, but my dining companions have enjoyed them. The shredded pork salad is a great low-carb choice. Tonight I had the ahi appetizer. OK, the ahi wasn't the best quality - a little tough and very light pink -  but it was fresh and tasted just fine, especially for the price. The potato skins with pork were also tasty, and the husband liket the shrimp cocktail.  In summary, Corbin's isn't blow-your-socks-off good, but they are consistently decent, reasonably priced, and have decent service. Tonight's server was particularly good, striking the perfect balance of attentiveness and sincere friendliness without being pesky.   My husband looked up the $5/glass happy hour merlot on the internet to find that Wine Spectator gave it an 87. I wouldn't rank it anywhere near that high, but it's serviceable for $5/glass.

Serious Blah.  Went there with some friends for lunch - some of their friends recommended it. Note to self - do not trust my friends' friends. The patty melt was a big hunk 'o' burger on greasy rye bread. Not enough else on their to taste. The side salad is iceberg blah, the clam chowder is creamy blah, and my friends agreed the Philly sandwich was shoulder-shrugging blah. The waitress was nice enough, but hard a difficult time grasping that I did NOT want a refill of my soda. Really, one giant glass is more than enough, already!

How slow can a restaurant be? Certainly not slower than this place, despite being only a quarter full at best.  Some friends wanted to meet here for lunch today thinking we'd be out in less than an hour, but apparently that was asking too much, despite the fact that our horribly complicated order consisted of only two salads, a side of steamed vegetables, and a kid's meal.  After waiting so long for our order to be taken and to get our food, we asked for the check right away because we had to eat and run.  While we continued to wait for the check, numerous other tables got served and all the servers joined in a signature birthday chant at another table.  eventually they got around to bringing our check.  And then came the dilemma of breaking a $20 bill.  Nearly 20 minutes just for that.  WHAT were they thinking???  They weren't busy and there were plenty of staff around.  So onto the food...  I had the Village Salad, a chopped blend of onions, cucumbers, green peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc.  with no lettuce.  Very tasty.  In the past I've had the hummus - it's fine, and the tsaziki - it's fine.  The service at previous visits was fine.  I would have gone with 3 stars if not for the horrible service today.

As the 40th review I'm not sure what can be said that hasn't except: * Fesh eggs are the BEST and are a little easier to get at the market now that there are a few more producers.  Plen to get them before 10 am * As of today, May 2, there are more produce vendors than I've ever seen and some prices reflect that.  I smeeled the carrot at one booth and had to buy some when I found that a gigantic bunch was only $2.00 * The lady selling the crocheted doo-dads gives away dog treats - stop by if you have your pup. * The dog bed from the dog bed guy are a hit with the canine set, and he does custom fabrics and sizes * The Mexican style shrimp cocktails are really, really good.  I get some most every week.  Mmmmm I love the feel and the vibe at the market.  A real community spirit pervades the crowd.  Phoenix doesn't get better than this.

My favorite full-size grocery store.  Like other reviewers, I notice it is always clean and neat.  It is also well stocked and the fruit and veggie quality is excellent.  The employees are pleasant and helpful.  This goes double for the pharmacy staff who recently went out of their way to fix a screw-up by my husband's doctor regarding an Rx. I have been going to that pharmacy for 10 years and always get excellent service.  A couple times I've gone right after a doc appointment with prescriptions that clearly indicate I feel like crap (anit-nausea meds for example) and they bump my prescriptions up in the queue so I can get home ASAP.  Maybe they just don't want a sick person hanging around, but that's OK too.The parking lot can be a nightmare, especially right before holidays.

The best thing about NYC are the DDs all over, and the fact that people bring donuts to every meeting held before 11 AM.  This DD does a mean job with the classic plain old fashioned, which I consider the litmus test of a donut shop.  So, while a good donut is always tops in my book, why only 3 stars?  It's the Christown Walmart version of DDs.  It is almost always crowded, and with people who talk really loudly with lots of "ain't got none" and "they don't got none a that" phrases thrown in.  I went on Saturday and was sandwiched between a woman with half her top teeth totally knocked out who kept yelling at a friend who was seated at a table (lot's of "ain't"s and things thrown in), and a guy who was crowing about how he's being paid to stand in line because's on the "shop run" getting donuts for the guys at the shop....  now there's lots of people in the world, but when the line is 40 people long, why do they talk like we ALL want to her about it??  And there was a guy waiting up by the counter with a dog on a leash.  A somewhat scraggly looking pit bull.  No indication whatsoever that it was a service dog.  On top of all this, I got stuck behind a lady and her daughter that considered the selection of their dozen as the most critical decision of the year and held up all the loud-talkers in line behind them. The wait was interminable.  Access is also an issue - it's tough to make a left hand turn into the place and virtually impossible to make a left hand turn getting out.  The line can get so long in the drive through that it blocks in some of the parked cars.  Why this is the only north-central DD is beyond my comprehension, and my love of the donuts is the only thing that keeps me coming back.

My favorite movie theater. Why? It's clean, the refreshment lines are short, many nearby dining & drinking options (and not just a Sbarro's or Chile's), covered parking (underground), it's a relatively safe neighborhood, and it's not tucked in a shopping mall. Add another plus - customer service. Last night we lingered at Morton's so long that we missed our 7PM show for which we prepurchased tickets. No problem they said, and handed us tickets for the 8PM. Very cool.

Great dog park for space, shade, lack of soggy areas, and lack of ants. Only a small part of the park is lighted in the evening, so I think that's why a lot of unretrieved poop left behind - the place is big enough that you cannot see if/where your dog is going after dark. I tried after dark once, and have since limited my visits to the AM.   The incidence of aggressive dogs and dog fights is pretty low on weekend mornings (the only time I visit). Lot's of regulars are pretty good about talking to the occasional visitor with an aggressive dog. Abundant convenient parking, but don't leave anything valuable behind in your vehicle - I've seen numerous break-ins.

I can't dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructor's approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons. As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because I've only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  I'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star.

First off, I am a huge Baskin Robbins fan, as their mint chocolate chip is the ice cream of my dreams, and I was jonesing for it today. The 19th Ave and Dunlap shop is in a mucho nasty mini-mall but he shop itself is generally clean and well kept. The ice cream of course is the same as any other Baskin Robbins so its really a matter of personal taste as to whether or not it's to your liking. What I like about this shop is that generally 2 or three people are working there and they don't hesitate to skip over people hmmming and hawing over their selection to help those of us who look like we are on a mission and clearly are ready to order. When you're jonesing for the mint choc chip, it's hard to wait...

5 stars for the special fishes. The wild caught salmon, the ono, and a couple other atypical fish they had this past weekend. It's been months since I've been here (I'm wondering WHY it took so long to come back). Their fresh fish has always been the highest quality and fresh. I'm sashimi all the way - no rice to muss things up, and no desire for most of the cooked stuff - so my rating is really based on the fish experience. And the salmon skin - excellent rolls and hand rolls. I have found few, if any places in the valley with as good selection and quality of fish. Prices are certainly not cheap, but the if you are all about plain slices of raw fish, it's is way better than the cheaper places.

I'm a basic dog fan - ketchup and onions and nothing else.  Let's the dog taste come through.  Don Guido's has been consistently tasty on numerous visits.  OK, it's a hot dog... not much to screw up... but it's tasty, hot, not overcooked.  Onion rings and fries are both good.  I always leave full and happy, an the service is very friendly. If only they were open later in the evening, I'd be there more often (they close at 5 or 5:30 on weekdays and at 3:00 weekends).

Don't sew, don't knit, don't craft...but every once in a while I need things like a specific  blue thread to replace a button, or some fabric dye to revive a pair jeans that have faded from black to to "graphite"...  Everything was easy to find, and the staff, while unenthusiastic, was helpful.  Fabulous thread selection. They have a great setup for buying a sewing machine - all are set up so you can try them - very nice!  Almost temped me to believe I ought to get one, but then I came to my senses.

Nice decor, so-so food.  Probably the most bland pho I've had in the Valley.  Nothing particularly negative about it - except of course bland pho is fairly negative.  The menu selection is also fairly limited compared to every other Vietnamese place I visit (Da Vang comes to mind, but who can compare with them?).  I'm going to go try a  few other selections and am keeping my fingers crossed they warrant an upgrade to 3 stars.  But can't do it based on the pho alone.

Try the ox tail pho!  I was silly with glee that Pho Loc finally reopened so that I could have my favorite pho - ox tail.  If fact this can hardly be considered a full review of their menu, because during the dozens times I've been there I pretty much order one thing - ox tail pho.  I've tried the myriad selections my husband has ordered, and while all are quite tasty (lacking ox tail pho, I'd be happy with any of them), nothing comes close to my favorite. Why ox tail you ask?  The meat comes in tender hunks, not in thin slices or manufactured ball shapes.  The texture and taste is fantastic.  Ox tail meat is pretty fatty, but don't be dismayed - it is so tender that you can usually separate the meat from the fat with only chopsticks. Along with the availability of ox tail (I tried pho shops all around Phoenix during Pho Loc's absence and could find it nowhere else), Pho Loc serves some mysterious slender-leafed green to put in the soup along with the mint and bean sprouts.  I asked them what it is, but they did not know the English translation, but did comment that it is "very expensive".  It's extraordinarily tasty, and once again I have not noticed it at any other pho places. The dessert made of crushed ice, coconut and red beans is tasty, especially on a hot day.

There is a special place in my heart for good restaurants in Sunnyslope, and Bombero's is right there.  I only wish the wine were better priced.  Considering the fantastic deals for superb wines that can be found at the liquor stores now, the I have a hard time paying over $10 for a glass of South American wine. Now for the good stuff.  Much has been said about the ambiance and food, so I'll hit a few different topics.  Wine Tastings:  Most first Mondays of the month, Bombero's hosts a wine tasting with expert Kim Hartleroad.  Kim helped select the café's wine list and fountain of useful, bizarre, technical, and always interesting wine facts.  Each tasting develops it's own personality based on the attendees, as the casual atmosphere encourages questions, and  comments, discussion.  The $25/pp fee is a great deal considering that it includes 4 glasses of wine (refills are common, so make that at least 4!), bread & olive oil and cheese or cheese and meats, some bruschetta, AND interesting wine information, it's quite a good deal.  At the February 2009 Wine Tasting Kim focused on different styles of the same varietals.  He brought a wine-makers scent kit to help us identify the individual scents in the nose.    This was a hoot.  Breakfast:  The breakfast wraps are tasty, and as of 3/3 the vent hood is fixed so they are available again.  They are a bit pricey, or I'd have them more often.  The yogurt parfaits are rich and sweet (I get mine with about  1/2 the usual honey).  The yogurt is unflavored, which is hard to find and my favorite.  The coffee is Illy, and consistently rich, smooth and strong.

It's all about the fish and chips. The four stars, that is.  Light and crisp and moist...  with malt vinegar on the chips.. Ohhh yeah, it's that good.  The other food I've had has been fine  - a couple salads, burger, sandwhich... good, but no shouting from the rooftops. The beer selection works for me (as long as there is Guiness, I'm happy).  Be sure to check out the chalk board in the bar - sometimes they have a "get a beer for 1 cent if your last name begins with...."  One day the magic letter was "W" - no kidding!

It's a half mile away, I can run in and out in a  few minutes without aisles and aisles of streamlining children and preening mommies, there are lots of really, really good deals, and the guy who cooks up the samples (I'm embarrassed I forgot his name) has some great ideas. What more can you ask for???  OK, OK, if you like to inspect each apple, choose from 12 varieties of granola, etc., you won't like it.   For example, choices of apples are usually four packs of either Gala, Fuji, or Granny Smith.  Take or leave.  BTW, the Fujis are usually the best. The F&E brand items are hit or miss, mostly hit.  I like the F&E putenesca sauce.  Come to think of it, there have been a few "misses" but I cannot remember them... (remember the over 40 bit, Ok?).  The olive tapenade tastes straight out of an Italian deli, the stuffed baked potatoes are a great meal in a pinch.  The giant boxes of mixed salad greens are a staple in our house. The meat selection is pretty darn extensive - a variety of pork and beef cuts, sausages, and sometimes even lamb. They have chicken also, but since I am allergic to it I never paid it much attention.  The cooked shrimp makes a good quick meal - either get a package that includes the cocktail sauce packets or get a bottle from the condiments aisle (the F&E brand is surprisingly good).  The tilapia is excellent.  Grill with a  little salt and olive oil.  For ease and budget-tending, I love F&E.  Tip:  Avoid Sundays, as that is when their stock is lowest.

The location and atmosphere are tops, service is fine, food is forgettable.  I can say this because I ate there about a month ago, and now that I'm getting around to doing the review I can hardly remember what we had - a rare thing from someone who can recite an excellent meal course by course for years afterwards.  we did started with quesadia, and the four os us all got different dishes, all of which I tasted and not of which were either outstanding or offensive.  The red wine selection is heavy on the highly fruity/jammy styles.  The location next to the light rail on Central, and with the big outdoor patio can make a trip to Maizie's worthwhile if you are looking for a place sit, talk and nosh, if nosh isn't your key focus.  My husband and and I went with some relatives we hadn't seen in ages, and it was a great place to sit and catch up for a few hours.  And despite the crowd's that evening the server was gracious about not hurrying us out of there.

This place must be used to constant flow of new customers brought in by the adjacent stadiums.  i say that because I cannot see why anyone would specifically choose to return.  Not that the place was horrible - but Like the 2-star guideline says "meh - I've had better".    Lets start with the service.  We got there before the stadium crowd showed up and placed out order.  Evetuanllyt the crowds streamed in, took theor seats, ordered and were served.  And we continues to wait - no server in sight.  After about 25 minutes and all the tables around us being seated in served while we wated in hunger, the server stoppped by to say our order would eb coming soon.  Clearly they must ahve forgotten the order, but no admission, no apology.  After the ffod finally arrived, I sat for a long time with an empty cup of tea befoer a refill arrived. And another long wait for the check.  Now the food - I ahve toa dmit that a few things were really good.  The yellowtail tartar starter, served with a layer of green fish egg (not sure what kind) on top, was luscious.  i regretted sharing with the husband, as I could ahve eaten it (plus a second one!) by myself.  The lobster roll and soft shell crab roll were also delicious.  Not too sweet, not too filed with mayo and only a touch of Krab-with-a-K (it should be illegal).  We hoped the salmon and snapper sashimi would round out the meal and make us forget about the long wait... but sadly, they were both soft and mealy-textured, and not worth the stomach space after the tasty rolls.  The bathrooms have angled walls that can be a bit disorienting, but rather funky in an OK way, despite the been-there-done-thatness of the theme.  It was the floor drain that was covered over in strips of masking tape that had become stained with dirt and grime that yucked me out.  In the stalls, facing the wall when I entered all looked clean (except the yucko-max drain tape),  Upon taking a  seat and viewing the walls of the stall, I say the bottom 2 feet of the stall walls were filthy.  I guess whoever clean the bathrooms only faces in the stalls and never turns around.  Bleh.  The server, when he made his infrequent visits to our table, was kind and courteous (except for treating our wait like a matter of course).  As a result we weren't quite as miffed about our $90.00 (no alcohol) dinner as we otherwise would have been.  It's amazing what simply being nice can overcome.  unfortunately, not enough to make it beyond 2 stars

Clinton and Stacy say '3 words - Find A Tailor"  They'd be SO proud of me because I found Valentina.  I've had numerous alterations to pants (hem, waistband, rise, leg width), jackets and shirts (nip the waist or shoulders, add darts..), and even one dress that she took completely apart and put together in a shape that fits me.   She will either do the exact alteration you specify or - and this is the nice part - give suggestions as to how to make something fit better.  Her prices are fair, and turnaround is quick.  Shut UP!!

What fun! We had a great dinner at our first visit to Noca and thoroughly enjoyed the taste, presentation and unique flair of the food. The cuisine was creative yet yet still harmonious, fresh and high quality. A culinary adventure (in a  good way) - we couldn't wait to experiencet each course.   After we ordered we received two complementary treats - first a gazpacho "granita" (like a tomato icee with basil oil) and a cold fresh pea soup. Both excellent and perfectly refreshing. For starters, my husband got the cold corn soup, which was naturally sweet, rich and luscious. I had the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and fried tempura style. Excellent, though I think I'd like anything cheesy and done tempura style, so maybe I should have tried something a little less conventional.   We then shared a large raviolo with duck egg in the center and rich lobster sauce with mushrooms. Delectable; and I'm glad we shared because it was quite rich and filling. The serving temperature was luke warmish - I'm not sure if that was by design, but it would have been even better piping hot.   Our main courses were scallops for me and sliced rolled beets stuffed with cheese for my husband. The scallops were done just right, and nicely salty (too much so for my husband's taste by I loved it). The beet dish was a play on a "pasta" dish with beets instead of pasta. The sweetness of the beets was nicely offset by the bitterness of broccoli rabe.   By the time we got through all this (OK I had to have some of the scallop dish packed to go), we were stuffed but were dying to see what they could do with the desserts. A complementary bowl of green apple cotton candy kept us entertained while we perused the dessert menu. If we had listened to our stomachs we would have stopped there, but the taste buds were in charge by that time. The lemon tart was a wonderful. The donuts were, well ... donuts. I personally think that's a good thing (mmmm...donuts), but next time I'll try a more creative selection.   On a Thursday evening we found the place less than half full so apparently weeknight crowds are hit or miss. The interior decor is spare yet comfortable. Until sundown the natural light through the windows is bright enough to make the interior a bit harsh and difficult to focus. I generally love lots of natural light, so I don't know why I found the lighting here so difficult.  prices are fairly high, and I'm not surprised considering the uniquness of each dish - many items are locally sourced and and are clearly albor intensive.  Regarding the of the dishes, I would be nicely sated with an appetizer and an entree, or only an entree for a light meal.  The multi-course feast I described here had me uncomfortably full, and I'm not a skimpy eater.  We aready have reservations to try one of their tasting dinners.

When I'm hankering for luscious meat, buttery sauces, or delectable fries, Christopher's always comes through. In countless visits, I've seldom been disappointed with the food. The hubby and I shared the lamb shank (available Fridays only) and it is melt-in-your-mouth, don't need-a-knife delicious. All the fries selections (truffled, curried with duck confit, yam) are excellent although way too large for a sane person to finish - plan to share. The truffle infused fillet is nice (though it cannot touch the lamb) and the hanger steak excellent. I've enjoyed the scallops and several fishes of the day, but the meats are the highlight. Crusty French style bread and unsalted butter accompany the meals. Vegetables are available ala carte and those I've tried have been good but generally pale compared to the meats   Light food is not the focus here - the salads are generally good (I particularly like the smoked salmon) but not enough for a real meal if you are hungry, and I consider them bordering on the expensive side but not too much so. Most other selections are rich with butter, cream, and/or animal fats. Yum.   The wine by the glass selection is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, with a nice variety of domestic, French, Italian and a few others (but who cares about those anyway). Best is during the 4-6 weekdays happy hour, wines by the glass are 1/2 off, making many of them a smoking deal. Happy hour is available only in the Crush lounge and at the kitchen Bar.   Atmosphere... I really like the open, cool colored decor and the hip but not stuffy vibe. I've gone there in dress and heels, and in jeans in Birkenstocks. OK, at least I had a cute little jacket to spruce up the Birke outfit. My favorite spot is at the kitchen bar, watching the heart of the kitchen activity. During slow times the staff has given us little tidbits of "test" items to taste, and Chef Christopher always says hello. The one down side of the furnishings is the ergonomics (or lack thereof ) of the kitchen bar chairs. Did the manufacturer ever test them with real people?? The seats are too deep to lean comfortably against the back of the chair. Those with perfect posture may be fine perched on the edge of the chair all night, but we like to linger over dinner and must either sit up without leaning on the chair back all night or slouch back and feel frumpy while gaining only a modicum of comfort.   Service isn't nearly as consistent as the food. Most of the time we've not been offered a taste of the wine before a full glass was plopped in front of us, sometimes service is so slow that we've trouble getting our orders in before happy hour expired (despite arriving 30 minutes before it was over), the red wine has several times come quite chilled, and the checks have come without the happy hour discount. On any given day the service is about 90% - pretty darn good but with something missing. The disappointing thing is that it's seldom 100%.   Christopher's periodically holds wine dinners and we attended one last September. Now that was a 5-star feast. I think we had 5 wines, but I can only describe it as endless refills. The food was excellent (though maybe a little too French for many - there were some super fatty pork bits and some sort of organ meat - I think... I loved every bit). Whoa, what a food and wine orgy. And fun, interesting people at the community table.

Crankin' it up to 5 stars after last night's duck, my last few meals,  and the last wine dinner - consistency of service has improved, which is what held me back from the 5 stars previously. Combine the improved service with last night's to-die-for good dinner and I can no longer hold back number 5.   I cannot believe I'd never ordered the Thursday-only roast duck before. Wow. The husband and I shared, and it was more than filling. We started by sharing the burrata and heirloom tomato salad. I tell ya' I wished I had a whole one - utterly delectable. We also ordered Brussels spouts on the side ("what?" you say? "Anne ordered a VEGETABLE???") and even that was tasty. All the butter probably had something to do with it. I also had a nice burgundy for about $11.00 (post-happy hour). I still think they have the best selection and quality of wines by the glass I've seen at any restaurant in the valley.   My first review mentioned a wine dinner. Last month we attended another one and the only problem was my stomach space could not accommodate everything my tastebuds were enjoying. Veal cheeks. Pigeon. Don't scrunch your face up like that - have you tasted Christopher's pigeon??? The wines were excellent but I kept forgetting to drink, being so enthralled with the food. Hmmm....maybe I'll go back for lunch today...

Always a pleasure to dine here. The food is creative and delicious, the service excellent. It was a pleasure to have Julio serve us at our last visit - we followed his recommendations for wine, entree and dessert and all were spot on. As always, I'm already looking forward to the next visit.

Breakfast review only..  It's a bad sign when the waiter warns the table the kitchen is very slow, so the buffet is a better bet if you don't want to be there for a while.  What's worse is that I considered this warning an improvement over past experiences - waiting forever to be served, and having only minutes to slam down a meal before heading to the next meeting.   I've had a number of business meeting breakfasts here, but ONLY because the people I meet stay at the hotel. The food is average. I cannot think of anything better to say about it. No standouts, no pitfalls - well, maybe the yogurt parfait because it is so small. I waited how long for this??? At least the waiter was gracious enough to give us warning...

I couldn't have been more disappointed with my first venture into a Two Hippies.  My husband and I rushed home to see who could hammer this place on Yelp first (he beat me).  I ordered a hot dog because I love hotdogs.  This one was large and cheap, but the flavor was mostly salt, and it looks boiled, which did nothing to improve it.  The bun was excruciatingly hot, and as soon as it cooled enough to eat, was excruciatingly tough and chewy (either overly steamed or overly microwaved).  Hot dog alone would have earned 2 stars, but unfortunately I tried to share the hubby's tacos...  eeeewww, the fish mush tacos were downright nasty.  Seriously, they were not just lacking good qualities, they had a mushy texture and bad taste.  The pork in the pork tacos was fatty, chewy, and overly marinated.  The green beef was tolerable, but nowhere near pleasant.  Overall a bad food experience and I came home hungry enough to pig out on Christmas cookies.  Atmosphere is fine, place is clean, service quick and pleasant - but that does not make up for the food.

Tasty, tasty, tasty, and great personalized service! A great addition to the PHX food scene.  Anywhere that serves me whole sweet shrimp (head and all) has won my heart - try them, don't be shy!  The soup dumplings were also to die for.  The 7 or 8 other dishes we had were all various degrees of tasty, though the shrimp and soup dumplings stole the show. I was there on a busy Friday night and got great service - in fact the server enthusiastically answered all my "first timer" questions about the menu, their clientele demographics, etc.  She even gave us a complementary shot of lychee shochu (YUM).  Decor is what I call "downtown hip" - looks interesting and feels modern and fortuitously stops short of the ultra-slick commercialized feel.  Have you ever read articles about how eating a variety of foods at one meal tricks your stomach into not feeling full as quickly?  Well I believe it here.  Prices are fair though be warned that if start out hungry and like Asian fusion, you could be ordering more food than any one person should be allowed to eat, and shelling out a pretty penny.  I admit my bill was more than I expected, until I reviewed how much I ate!  I cannot believe I was able to heave myself out of the chair.  Next time I'm going to limit my intake to a reasonable amount, and I expect my bill will end up in a more reasonable range as well.

I guess I prefer false food. After three visits, the juices are the only items that impress me. The edamame dumplings are bland; so is the soup - I cannot even remember which soup I had, which is not a good commentary on its memorability. The ravioli - OK, The fish - OK. I haven't had anything at TF that deviated from "OK", but for the mid-level prices I expect something a little higher on the tasty meter.   Service has been fine all three times I've visited, but nothing above what I expect for pleasant and expedient service. I always find myself distracted by the women servers' uniforms...I know it's supposed to be some organic cotton or something, but could they have come up with anything less flattering? I really feel for those poor ladies.   I've also noticed that every time I've visited the crowd is about 75% women, with probably 50% of the parties women-only. Not sure what to make of that, but maybe you can have fun playing sociologist and come up with an explanation.

Recently spent a weekend in the comfort of the Montelucia and was pleasantly surprised at the homey comfort feeling.  Maybe it has to do with the recession, but the Montelucia is certainly more laid back and friendly than the prim and proper Phoenician, or the elegant and lovely  Biltmore - both of which have their time and place, but for a lux hang-out weekend the Montelucia did the trick.  Our room was standard sized but sumptuously outfitted, with a lovely back deck facing Camelback Mountain.  The "adults only" pool is also an option near and dear to my heart, as I appreciate the lack of screaming tots and preening teens.  The afternoon with friends was spent at the main pool - a rather chaotic but clean gigantic pool with an adjacent open air cafe and bar.  We rented a covered cabana - a prerequisite for spending an afternoon in the Arizona summer sun.    The place is laid out a little wacky, resulting in an inordinate amount of time spent hiking  between pool/restaurant and the room in the mid-afternoon sun.  The restaurant situation needs improvement (see my review of Prado), and an indoor place to wait for the valet to deliver the car would also be appreciated. While the summer deals for locals are impressive and I was pleased with the accommodations, the cost of eating at the hotel will probably send me elsewhere for my next staycation.

With dishes ranging from unpleasant to mediocre to excellent, this was a difficult score to determine.  Ultimately I decided on 2 stars because of the price - for Prado's prices I expect consistent excellence.  The salad I ordered for lunch was accompanied by some lovely manchego cheese, however the greens were soused in what tasted like pure balsamic vinegar - too much of an acid trip for either me or my husband.  A couple other small plates for lunch were edible but forgettable.  The paella was a bland disappointment. The soft shell crab appetizer was fantastic, as was the whole roasted oratta (sp?), a Mediterranean fish.    The service was completely lacking - once our dinner was served we were completely left to our own devices - pouring our own wine, no water refills, etc.  At lunch we were left waiting with our menus for  about 15 minutes before our orders were taken - it a nearly empty place.  Maybe I'll pop in again for whole fish, but there are too many better places to drop a couple hundred for dinner.

Bland and Flabby.  $45 for a small, mediocre and forgettable meal.  I had the shrimp "ceviche", which I don't think had seen a drop of citrus but instead was made with tomato sauce that tasted suspiciously like canned tomato juice.  The chicken enchiladas which were tasty enough... to eat, but not to bring me back.  Besides, I could only have a couple small bites because I'm allergic to chicken (I know, I know - very wierd).  I thought a glass of riesling woud pair nicely with the shrimp.  One would expect that a Mexican place would stock a nicely acidic ,crisp riesling, but theirs is on the sweet and flabby side.  The Texas margarita tasked like those horrid "pixie sticks" from when I was a kid - sweet and tart and like it came from a  powder.  If there was tequila in the drink, I could not pick up on it ... maybe my tastbuds were dulled by the bland ceviche and flabby reisling.    On the good side, the cheesy paper fish hanging from the ventilation duct is the only bit of real character in the place.  It befuddles me as to why people had nearly filled the place by 7 pm.  Were they ALL first timers????  FYI, Yesterday's AZ Republic had a coupon for a free appetizer at San Gabriel, so dig your paper out of the recycle bin and see what you think of the place.

A disappointing cacophony of in-your-face flavors.  Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good. Here are some details:   Pasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal. Sauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better. The le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.   The carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity. On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place. As a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.

I love places that open before 7AM.  I'm an early bird.  Showed up at Scramble for the first time at 6:04 this morning to be greated by clean modern decor, and a friendly staff.  We tried the brizza (breafast pizza) with bacon and gouda, the gringo burrito, a cinnamon roll and coffee.    The portions are generous - not usually a selling point for me, but it more than justifies the price, which for the burrito is about double the price at a 'berto's (pick a 'berto, any 'berto).  The brizza was excellent.  I'm looking forward to the leftover half for lunch.  The gringo burrito was indeed gringo-y as advertised; fresh eggs, cripy bacon, lots of melted cheese.  Red salsa on the side (I wonder if they have green?) Not being a  melted cheddar fan, I'll have to ask them to hold that next time.  Cinnamon role was servicable - not crazy carbs-be-damned  good, but tasty.  I look forward to making use of the expanded patio.  Ergonomics report:  The benches are confortable!  How often does THAT happen??  Just the right height and depth to provide comfortable back support within reach of the table.  And the staff happily changed the TV channel from cartoons to CNN at our request.

Love the atmosphere, food, wine prices.  Showed up opening night and shared the requisite bruschetta with the hubby and a nice glass of wine. Met a colleague for lunch yesterday, and ordered "the plate", a mixed meat, cheese, et. al. appetizer that turns out to be more than a complete meal for me. My colleague loved his chicken panini, ordered on focaccia. Loved the MJ breads. Nice wine selection for decent prices.   Service was fine both times - quick and efficient, not overbearing. The inside nicely blends coziness with open airiness, and seems less stuffy then the Arcadia location.  For lunch I arrived at 11:40 and the outdoor seating was full, the inside almost so - consider arriving early or late if going for lunch.   I'm partial to valet parking, so I consider the parking situation perfect. Those who are valet-adverse will be frustrated, as valet is the only viable option unless you want to drive blocks into the neighborhood looking for a parkable spot.

A confusing, unwelcoming place. "Panini" implies Italian, they have menu items called "pita" and "gyro" on the menu implying Mediterranean, but the food and staff are Eastern European.   I finally stopped in for a lunch today after passing the place daily for the last year or so it has been open. I ordered the "beef pita", which is indeed beef but nothing resembling any sort of a pita. It was huge for one thing, about 10" x 6", and appeared to be a coiled sausage-filled tube of phyllo. The filling was a mildly seasoned meat. Nothing offensive but nothing great. The phyllo was mostly flaky, and in some places soggy, and the whole thing pretty darn greasy. I made it though about 1/3 of it before it was all too much. Next time I cross the Urals on foot, I'd like to have a few along, but way too large and heavy for a Phoenix afternoon.   Other menu items were several other "pitas", like spinach and feta, some "gyros", which from the pictures on the menu appear to be more like sandwiches, and a few salads. Fresh baked loaves of white bread and rolls were also displayed on a shelf for sale.   The atmosphere is not exactly welcoming. There are a couple outdoor tables which today, like most days I pass by, were occupied by smoking men with heavy accents. Walking up too the door, the look they gave me positively shouted "you are not one of us, why are you here?" and made me wonder is this place REALLY open to the public? Am I confused ... but the woman who served me was smiling, although "hello" was the only pleasantry I received. No inquiry about was this my first time in? How did I find out about them? Only two tables are located inside, one of which was occupied and one of which had food spilled all over it. Considering the unfriendlies hulking at the outside tables, it's a good thing I had planned on takeout.   No "enjoy your lunch" or "come again", and more glares from the unfriendlies outside when I left. I had planned to come back and try a few other things but I'd rather go somewhere else that seems to actually want me there.

If I am stranded on a desert island I want it to be with some chiabatta toast and jam from Lola with a soy latte on the side.  The quiches would be a close second, as would the savory scones.  And the blueberry tart of course.    Lola reminds me a lot of Lux in terms of the food and drink selection and quality, however the atmosphere is a more urban than grunge, and the furniture is cleaner and does not have holes in the upholstery.  I've always had great service here, though I show up very early so I cannot vouch for what it's like when it gets busier later in the AM.  The music could be turned down a little bit, but otherwise it's a pure treat to enjoy coffee and pastry with the morning sun shining in the windows.

Filipino food just like my sister makes!  OK, she's my sister-in-law (you can clearly see I'm not Filipino), but the food is just like her authentic dishes.  Check Iain B.'s review for detail on typical Filipino fare.  I am particularly fond of the pork adobo, beef machada and pancit.  The adobe is an intensely seasoned beef that I like to mixed into the pancit - a delectable blend of rice noodles and veggies which is made to order with chicken or tofu (yum) as requested.  The beef machada, a heavily seasoned thick stew of tender beef and potatoes is equally captivating. The restaurant is very casual, with only a  few tables, yet the decor rises above the typical Mexcian food takeout shop.  Oh yes, the Mexican fusion part...I admit the only "fusion" item i've tried is a pork adobo burrito, which was quite tasty.  but with all this great Filipino fare, the Mexican side hasn't tempted me much.   The only very slight disappointment is that in response to a customer complaining that the lumpia is to greasy, they changed from pork lumpia to ground beef.  Of course pork is greasy - it's pork!  That's why it's good!  Anyway, there is enough tasty fare here to keep me coming back.  The pleasant service and heartfelt appreciation of their customer rounds out out the experience.  Here's a hint - leftover pork adobo and pancit are just as good reheated for breakfast as they are in the restaurant.

Lovely, cozy atmosphere, creative and satisfying food, nice service. What a great experience!  Chef Porter has ascended way beyond the Tapino (which i always thought was pretty decent) fare here.  We had the Moelle Boeuf (bone marrow) and the Tartar for starters.  The marrow was lovely, done just right (a little red), with some thin sliced of toasted baguette that added rather than distracted from the rich, tasty marrow.  The small fennel salad that comes with the marrow was dreamy - I could eat a plate of that.  The tartar... now that was to die for.  All one could ever hope from a tartar.  Both the husband and I had the duck confit with white bean cassolet for our entrees.  The duck was nice, though a bit on the salty side for a confit, and the skin was on the soggy side.  Served as it was in a bowl of white beans, it was also difficult to cut past the skin and extricate individual meat pieces without losing them in the white beans.  The cassolet itself  was rich and interesting with what  appeared to be sausage hunks in it.  So overall the duck dish was pretty good but didn't blow my socks off.  The wine by the glass selection is fairly small (boo) and mostly French (yeah!).  The server suggested the Rhone, which was pleasing and paired well with the meal.  The menu is small - entrees included one chicken, one duck, one fish, one pork, one beef - but all looked appealing. Everything is in the French style here, meaning rich, rich rich.  Not a place for dieters or vegetarians.  The steak frites both looked and smelled fantastic - I cannot wait to try.  the decor has been aptly described in other reviews.  I particularly enjoyed the non-Phoenician feel of 1) the small size, 2) the low ceilings, and 3) the crowded elbow-to-elbow spacing.  It really is more like a French bistro on the inside than anything place I've eaten west of NYC.

I asked for stinky-sock cheese, and pow, did they deliver! The owner gleefully pulled several from a huge refrigerator case beautifully filled with hundreds of luscious cheeses, I was treated to several samples of some of the most delectable cheeses I've had this side of the Atlantic.  I returned home with a selection  of three cheeses wrapped in cheese paper (how often do you see that??).  What a treasure!

Best outdoor eating area I've seen in a long time!  With a  patio like that, how can you go wrong?  It's roomy and open yet cozy, and the partial shade is ingenious.  I was there a few weeks ago on the last wonderfully warm Sunday and could have hung there all afternoon.  The funky color scheme and decor is playful and hip.  I loved it.  Well, what about the food? Having missed breakfast, I had the 8 oz sirloin, the only steak on the lunch menu.  Now you've got me at "steak on the lunch menu", especially a lunch-sized steak, because who wants to carry leftovers around all afternoon?  It was pretty darn good.  Not out of this world, but definitely enjoyable.  My husband's poki salad  was pretty bland, but who orders poki salad at a steak place?  Don't answer that. We shared a glass of the cheapest glass of wine on thelunch menu, a sangiovese, and it was quite serviceable for the price.  I  important tip:  I requested my steak done "however the chef recommends" and it arrived at what I'd call "medium" - so if you are like me and want some red juicy inside, make sure to order it that way.  Yet my steak was still enjoyable even at "medium",,,  that's quite a feat!  Service was good, though we were pouring our own Pelligrino throughout the meal - I thought "hey i guess they don't pour the water refills here, OK" - until the  very end when she started pouring for us.  Hmm.  I'll update the comments on service after I try the place for dinner because they hired a friend who is a top notch server, so I know they must place emphasis on quality service.  Speaking of dinner, I'm kinda hungry...

Yes the decor is good, yes the inventory is gigantic, but there is nothing like poor service to turn me off to a place. We came in and asked if they had any 2004 brunellos. We were directed to the "Italy" section then left on our own. Luckily we could find the brunellos easily enough, but there was no one to offer suggestions such as "this one is a great value" or "this one is fabulous and well worth the $5.00 more than the other..." etc.   Well OK, that wasn't what we'd hoped for but, we we still OK. Next we were looking for a bottle of Justin Justification (a cab franc blend), plus we wanted to find a cab franc we hadn't tried yet. We had to wander around to find another person to help us. I asked for the Justin, and the guy was bewildered. I explained it was a cab franc blend and he took me over to the cab sauv section. When I questioned this, he told me they have the cab francs with the cab sauvs. This seemed weird, so I started looking on the other side of the isle in Other Reds (or some generic section name like that) and bingo, found the Justin, and a bunch of other cab francs. I was about to ask which he recommends when he blurted out "well, I have to get back to my section" and took off in what was almost a panic, leaving me to fend for myself. I was clearly about to ask a question - the words were starting to come out of my mouth... Was he really that afraid of being away from "his section"? Was he afraid of not being able to answer my question? I was stunned. I still am.   So by that time I was irritated, and with over $100 of wine in the cart was thinking maybe they ought to recognize I could be a good customer....so I decide to give up and head for the cashier. At checkout we realized we forgot one of the gazillion coupons they mail out and exclaimed "dang, we forgot our coupon". We did not expect any response, it was just an exclamation. Considering how prolific those coupons are, it would have been nice if the cashier said "oh, I have one here you can use!" but not doing would also be perfectly fine. Instead we get a stream of complaints from the cashier about how he hates coupons because customers never read them and always want a discount for something that does not match the coupon, yadda yadda yadda. Hm.... complaining about customers to other customers... is that wise? No. We are sticking to AJs where knowledgeable cellar masters can direct to good stuff, regardless of the price range.

Meat-a-palooza!  these gyros are total meat fests, and darn good ones at that!  I ordered one to go and when I got home and unwrapped the meat sprung forth from the pita in a luscious, tender cascade.  The onions and tomato were beneath the meat, initially making me fear there were none, but alas, the veggie bits were hiding below simply the overabundance of sliced gyro-meat (I know its supposed to be some sort of lamb mix, but let's face it, gyro meat has its own taste).  Was that dill I tasted in the sauce?  Mmmmm, it's good.  Piping hot, moist, tender, and I cannot believe I almost ate the whole thing.  I also ordered the hummus appetizers which was serviceable but not outstanding.  doubt if I will order it again, but only because I'll be tasting other menu items to see if anything can compete with their gyro.

Delicious.  Attentive and courteous service, quaint location, and did I mention - delicious???  Thus far I've only been here for a Javelina Leap wine dinner, and normally I'd reserve judgement until I'd had a meal or two off the menu.  In this the deliciousness factor wins out and I'm going with 5 stars.  The dishes here are a perfect example of completely unexpected combinations of ingredients blending harmoniously to achieve...well... deliciousness.

Drinking, eating, and shopping all in one spot - what more could one ask?  We selected a number of rich and pungent cheeses and some imported olives.  While the cheeses were being prepared on a board with some delightful MJ bread, we selected a couple wines by the glass.  We feasted leisurely, then wandered around a bit (me with my remaining wine) selecting some duck confit and artichoke hearts for dinner, a nice merlot for later this week, and a bottle of Chimay.  By that time we were in the mood for dessert and wandered over to the pastry counter to pick up a nutty petite tart and a Tammie Coe cupcake.  We returned to our table to enjoy the sweets, then went about figuring out how to get all our purchases totaled up.  The staff was plenty helpful and it wasn't very busy, but I can see how if could be difficult to make purchases from several areas when it does get busy.  All the staff were extremely helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs.  Because we were going to wander about for a while after eating and didn't want to lug our groceries with us, they offered to hold onto them for us, and to keep our cheese leftovers and duck refrigerated.  It was such a pleasant and tasty experience, I could have stayed there all afternoon sipping vino and nibbling cheese.  Can't wait to return!

An oasis of real food in the chain-restaurant wasteland of Ahwatukee/south Tempe.  The service can be slow and not all the dishes for everyone the table come out at the same time, but the food it worth it when it arrives. Fresh ingredients without fancy twists serves them well.  I recommend the grilled salmon.

Jaspers does well at exactly what it promises -  "casual Italian".  I've had the hand-tossed pizzas numerous times and was pleased with every one.  The dough is made on site and is a nice, thin blend of crisp and chewy like I've had in southern Italy.  The only pasta I've tried is the spaghetti with bolognese, with meatballs and sausage.  Quite yummy.  Be advised that the meatballs and sausage will be offered to you, but it may not be mentioned there is an extra charge for each.  In a meat-craving mood they are well worth it; but when feeling less carnivorous the bolognese alone would be plenty satisfying.  I've also had several of the salads, all of which are fresh and crisp.  Overall, great casual Italian.  Not gourmet-out-of-this-world, but really good, and consistently so.  The wine list is all Italian, but I'd rate it only OK.  They have a number of  wallet -friendly selections, but there are many better ones on the market at similar price points.   The cream puffs, if available, are a light and fluffy yet deliciously decadent way to end the evening.  The cannoli are also nice, but go for the cream puffs.  The service has always been attentive and pleasant.  At times several of the waitresses may seem overly attentive, but they are so honestly wanting their guests to enjoy the place that it's endearing instead of annoying.  Kind of makes you feel like family.  The big room in back is available for groups, and I've seen a group back there almost every time I visit.

It's not awful, but I have indeed had lots better.  I was planning on 3-stars based on the ribs,  until the salmon salad experience.  Dry, fishy-tasting salmon on a  boring bed of lettuce, and a grocery store-type roll with some type of disgusting spider web looking stuff on top of it.  The waitress figured out that the rolls were in a plastic bag too close to the heat and some of the plastic melted on the roll.  Why on earth would the cooks put that on a plate??? Food low-down:  Ribs - OK.  Pulled pork - dull.  Beer cheese soup - OK.  Salmon salad - Yucko.  Burger - OK.  So if the best I can say is "OK"... that pretty much sums it up. The service was really slow, but the waitress did notice we didn't eat much of the salmon salad so she comped us for it without us even asking - kudos to her for that.  She was also pretty appalled to have to tell us the cook's explanation of the plasticized dinner roll.  More kudos for caring.

Basic American-style food done well - sounds easy but how often do I actually find that?  I do at Thirteenorth (yes it's one word, not too).  In the last two months since the opening I've probably been there a dozen or more times (it's close, good, reasonably priced).  Everything is fresh made and I've enjoyed eery meal.  Consistency goes a long way for me.  The burgers are outstanding - and apparently it CAN be hard to make a good burger because I don't find them many places.  The cheesy version is a bit over the top with cheese for my personal taste, so I go for the plain and simple beef/lettuce/onion.  Mmmm.  Other favorites of mine are:  salmon flat bread, lobster mac & cheese, sweet potato fries, ahi appetizer or salad, creme brule, cheesecake.   The French dip was fine but not fabulous, as was the pan fried walleye.    I've had great service every time I've been there.  I do eat at the bar most times so I'm less familiar with the table service.  the staff has been pleasant, quick, and courteous.  One night I pulled in around 9:55 after seeing Brophy H.S.'s production of Hairspray - I was famished because I'd missed lunch and dinner and was desperate for food - the kitchen was closed and the chef was socializing at the bar - but he went back and made me a burger and fires anyway.  How many places would do that for a customer?  The atmosphere is little cold and industrial, with busy Northern Ave and the ugly apartments across the street in full view - ugh.  Good thing everything else makes me not care.

Clean, courteous, on time, pleasant....what more could I ask of a dental team? Well maybe to keep out of my mouth, but that would defeat the purpose of going there in the first place.  Everyone from the receptionist/biller to the assistants and Dr. Kethcart have been pleasure (considering the circumstances) to work with as I catch up on years worth of needed work.    My exam was the most thorough I've ever had - the usual poking around, plus testing gums all around, x-rays, AND photos, followed by a detailed review of the results.  I ended up knowing exactly what the problems were, my options for fixing them, the cost, how many appointments it would take and what would be done during each...Nothing at all like the "assembly line" dental office where I went last time and they took a  quick look and told me everything was fine - which it clearly was not.    One additional perk is that Dr. Kethcart has very petite hands and as a result I don't have to open my jaw excruciatingly wide. Hey, after 4 visits in less than a  month, that's a nice perk.  they also give discounts to patients who refer others.
