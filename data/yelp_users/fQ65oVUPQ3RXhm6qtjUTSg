While we are venting about the local "news" stations here - what the hell is up with all the local news-caster ladies feeling the need to look like Strippers?  Their clothes are horrible (can someone tell me why don't they have stylists?), bad hair dye jobs and way too much makeup - mainly the super glossy lips! Why does EVERYONE need to be a bleach blonde here in Scottsdale.  It's called Low Lights people.  Go to Ray Issa at Joya Spa in Scottsdale.  He will hook you up. You keep your natural color and high light with a little blonde (if you must).  You know, there is nothing wrong with being a brunette.  Minka Kelly, Jennifer Garner, many beautiful women are brunettes.  As far as the clothes.  Pretend you are a lawyer on Law and Order.  You wear an elegant SUIT.  You are talking about the news - not working as a hostess at a club! And don't get me started on the they way they market there TV spots - they are so cheesy, remember the one that was set in a diner - I believe it was Scott Light & Tram something (who is actually likable) - These kooks dressed up like bad characters from the show Alice (if you are 40 & up you may recall that show!). " I will have a side of live" - I wanted to shoot the screen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yikes! Make it stop - turn the channel.  And Mark Curtis needs to shave that cheesy thing above his lip!  He looks like a cop from Reno 911!

Well, I'm pretty much over the fedora look - I wanted something a bit more sophisticated (I'm not 21 or a hipster) so after a recent trip to Santa Barbara where I noticed several stylish people wearing the Panama hat style - I search everywhere in the malls - no luck - I know, your probably thinking why not buy on the Internet? Well, I have a really small head - a peanut head as my hubby refers to it! So I need to try hats on! I found Heritage hats - I walked it - told the owner what I wanted i was looking for a boom - I was in love (with the hat that is). He fitted it to me - did something cool to the brim - sprayed it - and I was gone outta there and am planning on rockin' my hat at a polo match next weekend in Santa Barbara! The only thing I would add would be for 100.00 hat; I would love to have it come in a hat box! :) This store is super low key - nothing fancy - but the had what I wanted and he was super nice!

This place is having an amazing sale.  You buy one frame & the second is a penny!  I go once a year and buy tons of frames - I love the silver one's and they have some pretty cool contemp styles as well.  I give framed pics out as gifts quite a bit - who needs another tie or a sweater?  Everyone loves a nice pic!  And since I go there a lot I know they aren't marking up there prices!  They have a great selection & the people have always been very helpful & nice.  I have also run in there when I need an item to finish up a painting (there paint supplies are a bit pricey) but there frames are great! Don't go during the lunch hour as they share there lot with several popular restaurants!

This shop is great! They are fast, know their stuff and have helped me with everything from a custom piece, to repairing my favorite super delicate necklace.  I can't say enough good things.  Location is super easy as well - I park at Sears at PV mall and walk right through and the shop is right there.  Great staff - Great work - So glad I found them!

What a nice place!  We ordered a beautiful poster - they framed it for a reasonable price (framing aint cheap!).  To top off our wonderful experience they sent us a hand written thank you note!  They were very prompt about the turn around time.  Wow.  Great spot.  Cute old lady who runs it.  I believe it is family owned.

Husband and wife team.  Small business, super nice, professional people, great work.    I have had my husband's custom Polo shirts embroidery there as well as workers shirts.  I have also known others who have had their custom embroidery work done here.  Great place.

Loved this place.  Super cool and beautiful bartender/waitress - Nikki.  Went for Happy hour with my love. Apps on menu were delicious.  Service great.  Also, LOVED the music playing in back ground.  Thought the flat screen TV (in main dining area) which allows you to watch the bar scene was genius!  I could sit there all night & just people watch - who needs reality TV!  There is reality Furio.  Great spot.

I love this place - it's yummy food - great old school service - love sitting outside. I'd say its my fav casual, cheap mexi food spot in AZ easily!  I also love that after dinner, we can go browse the art studios with our three year old in tow.  Inside is stuffy and loud - sit outside if you can!!!!

This is my favorite place in the Scottsdale area hands down.  Amazing food, nice crowd and always consistant.  And it is never to loud - I recall going to Mastro's thinking it would be a "nice" place and felt like I surrounded by a bunch of over grown Frat Boys with too much money to blow - money doesn't mean class!  Being from Los Angeles and being spoiled by some great spots - this place is so wonderful and always have such a nice vibe.  I do however wish they would make their portions larger!

We own a Miele vacuum.  This is a family owned small business (which I love). A super nice guy who usually has his pet dog at work with him and cool music playing in the back ground.  Great service, honest and good prices.  They repaired our vacuum once and even cleaned it - it looked brand new! :)

The hubby LOVES beer - I mean LOVES it - so I decided to surprise him by taking him to FPBC in Tempe - we had the little guy with us (as usual - I mean that in a good way). We pull right up front - Rock Star parking!  I see the misting systems going - and people hanging around the front.  Beforehand, we had a little trouble finding it so stopped at a house to ask for directions.  There was a happy hour house party going on - about 10 - 20 somethings hanging in the front yard playing ping pong & BBQ'ing - looking like a beer ad for a commerical - we asked about FPBC & the guys were very happy to help us with the directions and said cool spot you will like it!  I say to my hubby, see this is why I love Tempe, are you sure you don't want to sell the house in PV and move here!?!  Hmmmm....  So we find it, my first thought was ok, part the BWM around the corner so we blend in!  Then I thought nah, lets just go!  The first thing I noticed was a sign that read "no Minors" so I have the hubby wait in the car and ask the very hip, very alternative looking door guy if we can bring our baby in & he says sure just don't try and slip him a drink!  I thought I like this place already!  We sat outside as it was a bit too loud inside (for the little guy).  As well, that scene in Sweet Home Alabama played in my head about the girl in a bar with a baby!  So we sat outside - thinking that would be better? Hee Hee...  Mind you I hate beer but played along, so I ordered the lightest beer on the menu it was a peach ale - YUMMY!  The hubby ordered three weird tasting beers and loved each one.  We had the chicken rolls which we amazing and the shrimp Bruchetta (sp?) they use WAY too much garlic but it was still good and a great portion size.  We will go back for sure, but I think we will leave the baby at home - so we can really enjoy the noise :)

This afternoon, I begged my husband to get me out of Scottsdale.  I, based on there website, checked out The Clarendon Hotel in D-Town (be patient Boa is below) - It was so horrible - that is all I will say.  I felt like I was in a bad John Waters flick - if Sid and Nancy were alive (and traveling) here is the place they would be!  Yikes!  I will say that the front desk guy was very nice and the decor was cool (although they need to repair whatever is going on with there front entrance).  Perhaps, I am just too mainstream.  Sorry Clarendon.  Now on to Boa....  So after our d-town debacle, we headed to Tempe - where I had gone some time in the 90's - ok, I am not that OLD!  Be nice!  I told my hubby about this cute little spot called Cafe Boa - so we drove around until we could find it and boom!  There it was - much bigger - and better than ever.  The staff was amazing and I must say the LA girl in me came out and I caught myself thinking wow, what an attractive staff they have (it was also so refreshing to be away from the bleach blonde, fake boobed - Bentley driving people in Scottsdale.  The service was wonderful (especially given that we walked in with a baby and no-one cringed) - in fact, that did the opposite!   The decor was lovely, staff very knowlegable and food amazing!    I had the shrimp app - my hubby had the Kobe burger and our 7 month old had crushed sweet peas (opps!  that wasn't on the menu!) but something tells me they would have made it for us if we had asked!  Best part, I thought the pitcher of Sangria was over priced at 30.00 but when the waiter came over and poured the bottle of wine directly over the ice - I though, hmmmm, maybe this isn't such a bad price and then we got the check and the pitcher was 1/2 off due to Happy Hour and it was a Sunday!  I loved this place and can't wait to go back.

I love this place, I used to go to RA - but couldn't hear myself think (cause the music was way too loud) Am I getting old or what?  No really, I go out to talk a visit with friends - I can't do that with blaring music and for whatever reasons - I didn't like the set up of the place.  I however LOVE Stingray - We go early like 5 or 6 and bring our 4 year old who is in love with all the sweet staff (and beautiful staff) - especially the one that could be Nicky Hilton's twin!  We sit outside (no matter how hot it is).  The food is amazing, in fact, the spicy tuna on top of crispy rice tastes exactly like the sushi at famous sushi spot in LA!  We love this place!  And another plus is we have been able to park close by every time - maybe that cause I go so damn early!  Under "attire" - I put casual - but your going out people, look like you care!

Wow!  I loved this place.  We went for happy hour (5:00) before we went to the Phx Art Museum.  Amazing bar food.  I had the Slopy Joe and a big fat pretzel.  Carbs anyone?!?  The beer selection was great.  Our waitress was super friendly and informed.  I also loved the decor.  I would have stayed longer but our little guy Evan was a bit too excited - I think the really loud music was a bit too much for him, and to be honest even though we loved what they were playing, it was a bit too loud for us too.  I can't wait to go back but we will leave the little guy at home so we can really dig in and stay a while!

I think there food is amazing!  However, it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there.  I love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are!  I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass!  Come on!  Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts!  Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in!  Save the flops for the pub!  Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!

Love this nice, older, Asian fellow named Tony.  I have taken soooo many things to him from cheap lugguage to be repaired to my beloved Gucci and a vintage Chanel bag.  He does a great job every time, has never been late getting stuff back to me.  And best of all doesn't charge me an arm and a leg!  Highly recommended - tiny shop.  Hidden - but great location.  Near Shea and Tatum - near UPS store, Cleaners and Subway - behind Gas Station - In Alberstons shipping center.

What a wonderful store - I am new to riding (English Saddle, not Western).  I had a child and what do ya know, my feet grew!  So I went to buy a pair of reasonably priced boots so I can take up riding again. Well, to my delight, they had the best of the best and they happened to be on sale!  I got a pair of leather riding boots that fit me perfectly - I have large "runners" calves. My last riding boots looked cool - but were fake leather! Yuck!  The amazing boots were only 59.00 - this is unheard of for a pair of top of the line, well made leather riding boots! So I am one happy girl!  I also picked up a helmet - that was also on sale!  The sales woman was so nice, professional (knew her stuff) and guided me to exactly what I needed!  Loved this store - was broken hearted when the sales woman told me most people come in and try there stuff on - only to leave their store to find it on the internet cheaper!  Yuck!  People, lets support our local business's - this isn't a Nordstrom - I am pretty sure this is a family owned business!  Thank you Cindy and happy riding!  I will say the only negative thing is there location - it is a bit hard too see from the street - I wish for them (they had a more visable location).  Screw the internet - I like to try my stuff on and meet the nice, helpful people along the way! :)

Come on?  Really?  Just because Oprah thinks there great, does not make them so!  Mine are better and they come out of a box and you don't have to wait in line for an hour!   I visited Cupcakes at there Beverly Hills store and thought they were ok - but nothing to write home about - in fact, they weren't moist enough!  When I saw the one that opened near Fashion Square all that came to mind was really?  Why?  And how the hell can there pay the rent selling cupcakes!?!  Hey, I am not hatin' just asking!

Yikes!  This place is scary!  The service was horrible although the waitress's were cute to look at (think Coyote Ugly - The movie).  The food was plentiful but very average.  It was just creapy.  Too bad, the bull riding could have been cool.  Just not my thing.   Sunday afternoon seems to be the time to go.  Everyone was drinking and watching the game on flat screens.  Reminded me of a place you might see the girls from Rock of Love hanging out at!  Ha!

I LOVED this place.  The decor was beautiful.  I am so happy NOT TOO SEE any hints of Tuscan designs (like so many places do in Scottsdale).  Oh, I can't say enough good things about this place.  They even have a Jazz club upstairs.  I felt like I was in San Francisco when I entered.     When dining in the restaurant I loved the surrounds - I felt like I was in Santa Monica or Malibu, CA.  I give major props to the interior decorator.  The food was amazing.  Risotto as good as Hal's in Venice - Steak was great.  Service wonderful.  The menu was diffinately for foodie's (think San Francisco) NOT for yahoo's - Scottsdale people may have money but  not the most sophisicated - money doesn't buy taste (sorry just what I have observed by too many of the people I have met)  I have also met some great people here including my husband who is born and raised here!  It made me sad not to see this place packed as the food is as good as Element's (my fav spot) MUCH better than T Cooks (that place is SO overated).  I would say I liked it better than Elements due to the large portions.  Sorry Beau of Elements - I think the portions are too small.    If they wanted to make changes - I would add some music over a sound system - nothing too "cluby" maybe even French lounge type music (perhaps a DJ - Peabody comes to mind).  I would also do some kind of Happy Hour at reduced prices to create a buzz so word can get out.  I REALLY want this place to suceed.  I think it was great!  They nailed it on so many levels.  If they are going to make some major changes which I don't think they should - I would suguest the powers that be go to Boa Steakhouse in Santa Monica and get inspired by there amazing menu.   I would also check out Ago in LA - and try to create there seafood risotto.  There cocktail menu was so extensive and wonderful.  Go to this place - it is worth the prices and them some!

Wonderful place!  Professional, good communication, fixed the problem right away and didn't charge me when I returned back months later for additional help.  I would not have known what this place was, as the sign isn't clear from the street.  I just walked in out one day and asked, "hey what do you guys do?" Days later, I took my laptop in for some simple uploads etc.  They were the first people who were able to do what needed to be done quickly and didn't charge me a lot of money. The location can't be beat!  I can get my laundry, tan and groceries all in the same place! It was also drama free unlike going to the dreaded Geek Squad!  Hope they stick around for a long, long time!  I would also sugest they branch out Los Angeles, CA would be a GREAT place for them!

There Happy Hour is great!  1/2 off App's - everything on the app list is amazing - especially the shrimp and catfish taco's!  And they have the MOST amazing marg - it is made with Chambord (sp?) and you are limited to only 3 b/c they are so damn strong!  Wish the crowd was hipper - it seems to be a bunch of old folks - but that could be b/c we go some damn early!  Service is always great - food is always good - and there Berry Cobler will rock your world!  I am going tonight and can't wait!

Delish!  Well, this super cool spot was my favorite sushi spot in LA, CA and now they have graced Scottsdale!  I would compare it to Asia De Cuba (but better - not trying that hard) and decor blows ADC away!   Very hip and not too crowded (yet).  Hope it can keep a trendy feel (while still remaining sophisticated).  All sushi rolls were great and loved the Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus (very tiny, but tasty) Loved banana desert & signature cocktails.  The decor is amazing.  Upstairs bar with pool is pure eye candy.  Love the red shades.  A back drop for a great night out for sure.  Service was AMAZING.  Hostess was friendly and professional, GM came to our table - very cool and nice.  Waitress rocked - what more can I say?  LOVED IT!  Going back again tonight!

Wow!  Loved it!  The portions were a bit too small for the prices but the food was great.  Hostess was especially friendly.    Table side Gac is AMAZING but again WAY too tiny - especially for 12.00.  The Primarita Marg was super yummy - but again, pricey!  I felt like I was back in Los Angeles with these prices! Great parking as well!  The decor is beautiful and different for Scottsdale.  Great crowd. I felt like I wasn't in Scottsdale.  It had an up north feel (think San Francisco).  Cool place.  This is by far my favorite place here in AZ - I bring all my out of town guests here and have many girls nights out - and date nights with my hubby. Love that its dark and cozy - but hip at the same time. I have NEVER had bad service or a bad meal - this place is GREAT!  The owner Brian is a doll, his sweet wife works there too - wonderful, wonderful wonderful!

After having HORRIBLE experiences with several haircolorist in Scottsdale - and having to return to LA, CA to have it corrected several times - I got lucky and found Ray Issa at the Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort.  He nailed my hair color and didn't charge me an arm and a leg!  He is also super sweet!  So excited to have found him!

Wow!  I have been to several OB practices here in Scottsdale and sad to say, have not been very impressed with any of them (usually over worked doctors and poorly runned or staff issues). What I usually experince is grumpy front office staff. Could never figure that out!  Seems like it would be a great job to have, beats digging ditches or working at Walmart!   This place is wonderful!  The front desk staff was nice, friendly and professional (front desk person Christina was a real stand out) She was really professional on top of things and bonus? Really nice!  Dr. B's medical assistant was great too.    The doctor, Tara Brodkin, MD was amazing. Professional and had a WONDERFUL bed side manner.  So happy to have found this practice.  Wish I had known of this practice when I delivered my son five years ago!  Best part, my insurance is covered by them!  Highly recommended!  Keep up the good quality service and good, friendly attitudes at your practice!  Being a good doctor is one thing, but keeping your staff professional and with nice attitudes towards patients can be the real challenge!  This practice is run very well from what I experienced!

Amazing place!  The food is spectacular - the atmosphere wonderful.  The food is "clean" not mucked up.  The staff is great.  Poolside lunch is great too!  And they dont sweat you for being a "local" to enjoy the pool/resort!  This is my favorite resort in Scottsdale, hands down!  Mainly because I don't feel like I am in Scottsdale!  Love this place!

This pace is amazing.  They do threading which is so hard to find in Scottsdale - they also do makeup for weddings!  I love this place as it is so reasonable and I loved the people so much I have become friends with them!  I will be taking my hubby next week - I know he will prefer threading over me tweazing him!

Don't know where to begin, went to this place for my yearly checkup - a simple paps. Front desk girl had less than friendly demeanor, why does that always seem to be the case at medical practices?  Are these receptionists not paid well? Why do most seem so darn grumpy? Got past the front desk person and saw the medical asst. she seemed nice, friendly & professional.  So far so good.  Then the Nurse Pract comes in to give me my exam.  She was wonderful, professional and nice. She finds something a little off.  OK, we run a test to make sure everything is ok.  One test is done and imediately that is fine. The other more concrete test results are due in two days.  I wait (nervously). In the meantime, within a few hours of leaving, my tummy is sore.I call and get a less than caring attitude from the front desk girl (again) ok, whatever, clearly she has her own issues or perhaps I interupted her Facebook update time :)  The MA tells me to take some Motrin and go to the ER if the pain increases.  Huh? What? Is this a joke? I was fine BEFORE I went to their office and had my exam!  Yikes!  I take some Motrin and call it a day.  I call two days later for my test results (my belly is still sore).  I am told by the front desk person, the results are in but the Nurse Practioner is NOT there to read them, so I can't have them.  I say, what does that mean, I really need these reults, she repeats herself.   I say, nicely (as I always do...you get more with sugar than salt right? nah? maybe?). I continue, well, can someone else read them to me? I have been waiting for two days to make sure everything is ok. She seems put out, and tells me she will pass my call to the nurses line but states, they are not going to call you back until the afternoon!  I say, "great, thanks".  All the while thinking, what the hell is wrong with this chick? Who peed in her Oatmeal?  I then get a call from the Medical Aide who is clearly peeved that she even has to call me, sounding VERY stressed, she states to me,  "I never make these calls, this is something the Nurse Pract should do, but she is out".  I am thinking, ok, like that is my concern?  Shouldn't that be your office managers concern, not mine? I just need my results, so I can get on with my life and picking up my 4 year old in 10 minutes from school.  I asked more about my results by saying what does this mean, she responds, "it means what I am saying!" Who in the world is running this place? Is this a case of you pay peanuts, you get monkey's?   Or is this a place where the doctors have become to busy to have any idea of what is going on in their practice?  They should spend less time on the office decor and start training their staff.  After not being to pleased with the MA's phone call and more confused than ever about what the heck my results indicated, I googled my results and now understand what I have.  It's a sad day when you can't get a straight answer from a medical professional and you get a better idea from Google.    After letting the dust in my brain settle, I called the office and requested they mail me my test results as soon as possible so I may look them over.  I was completely stone wall'd by my friend the receptionist. She went on and on about they must be signed off first.  I said OK great, whenever they get signed today, tomorrow or 2015 - just send mail them to me - thank you!!!! She then passed along our conversation to the MA who called me back right away to try and well, I am not sure why is called - sounded like she just wanted to defend herself. I basically said, I am not happy with you practice, and your bed side manner is less than stellar! Please just mail me my results and I will start looking for a new practice!    My experience at this practive has nothing to do with anything other than a office that is clearly VERY POORLY run! Too bad I really like the Nurse Pract!

Yikes, the spot was soooo cute - and super close to my home. But the  SERVICE was horrible!  The food was good - but I assume it was the owners day to wait on tables?  She needs to stay in the back!  Wait, this place is super tiny...maybe there is not a back area! She rushed us to order.  Worse part was she tapped her finger on our check and said, "can we settled up?"  I guess she was in a hurry to count her "winnings" for the day? I have NEVER been treated in such a way before.  My associate said he had been there before and stated, I should have warned you, while the food is good, the service is really bad!  Yikes, I won't be back - unless the Southern Belle who served us disappears! The other staff (a cute guy who appeared to be a barista) was smiley and nice - wished he had waited on us!  Mind you, all the while we were being rushed, there was clearly no wait for our table!  As we parted - I looked back and notice all three staff people huddled around the cash drawer with there days tickets - people, get an office!  While, in this crazy business market - I get you need to make money, but while your place is open, focus on good customer service - and trust me, your business with thrive!

Wow!  I am impressed with this place!  I was referred to this spot by asking a girl at my tanning salon, "who does your nails?" When I called a really nice, well spoken girl, answered the phone and gave me an appt  and great directions - I went and had the new Axxium Gel Manicure done my Tam (its a family owned business) Dad, Mom, Sister and even little bro hangs out - they were all super funny, friendly and nice!  Loved this place! Can't wait to return, although since this gel manicure lasts a couple of weeks - it may be a while!

I moved to Phx from LA about 5 years ago (don't remind me) I have belonged to the following gym's.  The Gainey Village in PV (hated the prentense but loved both my trainers Nate and Chris), The Village on Camelback for tennis (hated the grumpy, frumpy soccer mom set and the tennis club was super "clicky"),  Life time Fitness on 56th and Mayo (was actually OK - def motivational as their were people in shape all around me), but too far to drive and too BIG - also hated their day-care! Gainey Village Day care was really good!  Lastly, LifePower on Shea - turned into a Yoga studio (sorry, I hate Yoga!). Well, with all that said,  I am over the moon that I found The Body Lab.  Staff is amazing, professional, classes are INCREDIBLE and have tranformed my athletic body to a more lean look and got rid of my gutt since having my child.   The people who attend classes (mostly women) seem nice enough to where I'm not cringing being in a class with any of them (ok, one time this goofball kept checking her phone during class - which meant getting on and off the equipment - which was very distracting, as she was next to me, but I think that was a one time thing - as I  haven't seen her since - maybe she picked up on me giving her the stink eye! My favorite class's are by Scott and Melissa B.  I also love Adam's cllasses, they have a Zen like feel.  The ONLY thing I would change is - it does get hot in there - which I don't like, as I'm prone to breakouts - I like the AC on!   This place is so wonderful and the location is great - I usually trail walk/run before or after my class as it is near the trail I like. I have since taken a break from running/trail - and I have lost 12 pounds.  I am leaner than I have ever been and can actually see a flatter belly - which I haven't seen since having my son 4 years ago.  I also love that its not a bunch of " bitchy chatty kathy's" . I come to workout and like being around nice, positive people.  I truly love this place! Lastly, I am a stay at home Mom (with my own business) and love that they don't offer child care!  This is Mama's time! :)  Their new location in No Scottsdale is wonderful!

Wow!  Truth be told, I am not crazy about my health insurance (Golden Rule) but since I rarely use it - I stick with it - every now again, when I have to use it to find a doctor, like today - I needed to have my feet looked at after years of running etc - my dogs were barking!  I went to Dr. Anna Natcher (who was someone I picked at random out of my insurance book) well today I found myself at the office of an amazing foot doctor.  She looked more like a fitness model than a doctor and her office manager/receptionist was sooo nice and professional over the phone and in person.  I was blown away and super impressed with this office.  They were professional, friendly and on time!  The Doc saw me right away and gave me some great advice on my foot issue.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!

Love Lawrence!  He is so sweet, gentle and just has a great calming energy about him. He is on time, professional and does a perfect job. He listens to what I request (i.e. more natural looking lashes), not the stripper over the top lashes (so many goof balls in Scottsdale seem to rock).  love him and my lashes!  From what I see this is a family business.  Book in advance, as they seem very busy which means they are good at what they do!

Wow!  I called based this company based on a Yelp review I found this AM.  This guy/business owner answered his phone right away and set up an appointment for me the same day which was this afternoon.  He showed up on time - was friendly, clean and professional.  He also charged me a VERY fair rate!    His work was perfection.  My couch looks brand new, my 5 year old son's carpet looks wonderfully clean and my cool modern White Shag area carpet looks great (again!)  Wonderful company!  Highly recommeded! :)  Sandra

WOW!  Love this place!  I stopped running due to the heat and within 30 days packed on the pounds!  Started this workout and within days felt the inches melting off my waist!  Great energy, great staff - perfect location!  Very positive, clean, professional place.  And all sorts of different people working out in a group setting.  Young, old and in between (that would be me!)  Check it out!  I am sooooooo excited I found this place!  Gotta get my hubby to join with me! :)  He hates gyms - so this will be perfect for him!

Love this place. Nice. VERY clean. Polite staff. Kelly is the best. They are a whole family that owns and operates the place. Love the state of the art equipment. Next to another place I love called Zen Reflexology.
