Both myself,  and my husband have found Global Chiropractic to be life changing for us both.  My husband has suffered with constant back pain due to work, and sport. Dr.Steve has completely renewed our faith in Chiropractic care. My husband regularly leaves the office feeling completely repaired, and finds the care provides consistent improvement. It has totally changed the quality of his life thus far! I came in suffering with exaggerated Kyphosis which has caused the "hunching" of the shoulders,  and contributed to back pain. I exercise regularly,  and this was interfering with my ability to do so. After just a few visits I saw noticeable difference in my posture! Dr.Steve takes quality time with us whenever we come.  He is extremely thorough in determining and evaluating the needs of his patients. I could not wait to review for such a life changing experience.  HIGHLY recommended especially if you have lost hope in your situation!

I have been going to The Coffee Shop since they opened their doors. I absolutely love the cozy atmosphere, and lively setting. I never have to give my name when ordering because they always remember who I am. The food is so delicious.,the cupcakes are unique in taste, and addicting! I love the breakfast burritos as well. My kids also love going, and have grown up enjoying all the different things they have to offer. you cant go wrong!

I have been going to this Chick Filet since it opened. I have always had the best service, and have enjoyed taking my kids here over the past few years! I had never considered writing a review until tonight because it was such a terrible experience. Upon arrival at the drive-thru I noticed the girl who was taking my order clearly was not happy to be there. She sounded very unhappy and very irritated through the speaker, and when she said "my pleasure" it was clearly anything but. However I understand people have bad days, and I moved forward in line. I had decided to order coffee this evening, and I had asked the girl if they had coffee available to which she had replied yes. When I did get to the window they had informed that I would have to drive out front while the coffee was made. I was reluctant but I assumed with such great service in the past this would go quickly. I was wrong..I sat out front for over 10 minutes before I walked in to ask what was taking so long. While the girl who came over to me with coffee was apologetic..the woman Mikayla who was wearing a white collared type shirt who I assume was the manager just stared at me. She saw me ask about my coffee, and how I had waited. Not only did she not offer me any kind words she looked at me as though I were a major inconvenience. I was so offended at the whole experience that I decided to type this review. It was so bad that after all those great experiences this one night overshadowed them all. I hope they make some changes..
