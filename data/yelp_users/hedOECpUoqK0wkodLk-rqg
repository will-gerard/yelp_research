A great walk, with superb animals! The animal environments are very clean, and the inhabitants seem very happy with their man made homes.   If you happen to be in Phoenix during December or early January, make it a point to go check out the Zoo Lights. Weather will be much cooler then the summer months, and the lighting displays are really inventive and appealing.   Overall, this zoo is one of the better ones I've been to, and doesn't disappoint on any level.

Been in this airport about 100 times and each time I have a good experience. Free WiFi with many places to plug in your laptop, quick security lines, and smooth baggage claim make this one of my favorite airports west of the Mississippi.   A quick note: This airport is huge, so if you have some time to kill before your flight, you will have no problem entertaining yourself here.

Disappointing to be sure.  I should have checked the most recent reviews here before stopping in with my grandma.  We had french onion soup and it was so salty, BOTH orders went back.  It was one of three times I've ever seen my grandma send anything back.  I was really in the mood to enjoy some top-shelf vodka that day, but I wasn't going to be doing it here.  For a place in this price range not to have anything even remotely close to top-shelf is offensive.  Save your time people who are going to email me about how wonderful Grey Goose is.  Instead of sending me an email I'm not going to read, do some research on vodka and educate yourself.  Then and only then will you know what I'm talking about.  Back to Carvers.  I would look elsewhere for an "special occasion" place.  Food is overpriced for what it is, service is slow at best, and alcohol selection is on par with Red Robin.

Another nice zoo offering in Arizona, with the addition of an aquarium. (I find it odd there isn't an aquarium in downtown Phoenix though.)   Anyway, we started on the zoo side and saw many cool animals who seemed to spend most of the day lounging around or playing with habitat mates. They have many birds, reptiles, and even a baby animal nursery. Animals are diverse and worth spending the first half of your day with before you head over to the aquarium. Be sure to check out the albino wallaby! (Interesting to see an albino in the always constant Arizona sun.)   If you are feeling adventurous, head over to the hands on exhibits where you can run your hands along the back of a stingray, or pick up starfish.   All in all, a great zoo/aquarium and though it's a little more expensive, it's worth the money. Use your entertainment book for the valuable two for one coupon!

Quality is very good, and the prices are very fair.  If you're in the market for a really great steak this holiday season, please skip the supermarkets, come to Bob's and get something your guests will really enjoy.  Steak, sausage or ribs, no matter what you're after, it's here.  Bob's is a cut above!

Compared to the one in Seattle, well, can't really compare it.  Reviews for this chain are all over the map, so I guess it depends on the location and reviewer.  Portions here are just as huge as they are at every other location, and for me, that isn't a plus.  I'm not a fan of leftovers, and I know going in that no matter what I order, I'm taking some home.  I came here with my grandma and her friend, who are in their 80's and don't eat much.  I think we left with more food then we ordered.  The layout of this location is insane.  It's a seemingly never ending maze of rooms, hallways, and passageways.  It was also loud and there was a baby crying somewhere near our table, but due to the layout, I was never able to pin down exactly where.  Service wasn't anything great, and I got the impression that she was getting towards the end of her shift and wanted to go home.  I'm glad I live near Seattle, so if I'm feeling the need for some huge portions of Italian food, I can hit the one downtown.

No one really wants to listen to people gripe about their, or in this case, their family's health problems do they?  I'll keep this one brief, Mayo of Scottsdale is an INSTITUTION.  It really doesn't matter what ails you, they'll have a cure, or will point you in the direction of someone that will...  Mayo, my hat's off to you...

One of the main hangouts in SCW for the locals.  Not one of my personal favorites food wise.  Everything tasted bland.  In fact, I've had a lot better breakfasts at a few of the local golf courses.  The staff however is wonderful.  Everyone was really friendly, and quick, I didn't have to ask to have my water refilled once.  Too bad about the food though, or this could be a very good local spot.

Food is just average, and the decor is exactly what you'd expect in a strip mall Chinese joint. If you are going to eat here, be sure to order take out, cause the staff is very rude and seems like you are bothering them every time you ask them a question.

Great mall!!  You really can't go wrong with Niemans, Nordstroms, AND Barney's New York under the same roof.  Mall is MASSIVE and just to walk it, WITHOUT doing any shopping will take a hour or two.  What fun would that be though?  Grab your Black Card, and come check this place out!

Mariners spring training is the reason I was here, and have to say it was a blast!   Weather was perfect, seats were very comfortable, and prices were really reasonable. While we did have actual seats on the lower level behind the third base dugout, I was looking at the sea of humanity sitting out on the lawn area just over the wall and wondering how much are those seats? I found out later they were only $6 and given the number of homers hit that day, I was jealous I wasn't out there to snag a few of them!   Sun was shining, the beer was cold, seats were great, and the Mariners won!  A splendid way to spend the afternoon!

Came in after a spring training game in the hopes of locating a very specific item.  Alas, they didn't have what I was looking for, and the store was in such disarray, I didn't feel like digging around it the chaos to try and find it.   I understand that Ross is probably the worst of all the discount stores, but for any place to be in such shambles, just doesn't make sense to me.   I wont be back to this location for sure.  Sorry Ross

Outstanding BBQ!!  Slow smoked baby back ribs that just fall off the bone!!  The onion rings are flaky and crispy at the same time, and the sauce they come with, I wish I could bathe in it!!  I don't live in AZ, but after eating here a few times, I've got my real estate agent on the phone right now...

I'm always in Arizona visiting my grandma, so I thought I'd stop in a give this place a try while grams was getting her hair done...   Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!! Let me run down a few designers for you: Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Seven For All Mankind, Coach, & Ed Hardy. Am I at Niemans? Nope, Marshalls.   I was just as blown away as you are reading this right now. I'm not sure how they got all this great stuff, maybe "it fell off a truck?"   As soon as my credit card cools down, (I think I set a Marshall's record for largest sale) I'll be back. This place is worth the three hour flight AND eating my grandma's meatloaf.
