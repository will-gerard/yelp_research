Not the same restaurant from a few years back.  We went on Christmas Eve and the food was horrible. Restroom smells foul.  The whole place did moot feel clean

Probably the best restaurant that I never will go back to.  Excellent food but it took 40 minutes to get our entree.  It was so crowded on a Wednesday night we were on the patio with no wine service and at the end of the meal we found out it was cash only. All meals did not come out at the same time. Felt forgotten on the patio.  Great meal. $80 for three. No wine. There is a compass bank in the parking lot. I had a service charge since I bank with a different bank but the owner is not paying any ATM fees or card charges. It's about $15 a plate so this should be built into the business plan.  It is 2014 -time to get ready for Apple pay. This ones a pass.

I've only been there once but I feel so much better! Why suffer with foot problems. I actually wore a 4" heel for a short time last Saturday night. That has not happened in yesrs
