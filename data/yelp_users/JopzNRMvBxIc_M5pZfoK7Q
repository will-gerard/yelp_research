Crooks. Do not buy a vehicle from these people. Once they have your money they no longer care about you or the condition of your vehicle.  They only have 15 day implied warranties on their vehicles. They rig up their vehicles to break down right after the warranty expires.  I do not see how they have stayed in business for so many years.  Again do not buy a car from them because you will be sorry.  .

Really did not like it here at all. Food was not particularly great either. I ordered a Ruben sandwich it had a weird aftertaste. I will not visit this place again.

Been going to Arribas for years. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but the last few times that I have been it was not so good. The service was awful and the wait was too long. Also I was not to impressed with any of the food that day.

The security guard at night called me a racist name. I was a long term guest at this place waiting for my house to finish and the management there seemed racist and judgmental towards young pretty single females. I would never recommend anyone to rent from here because of the current manager in charge and the racist security guard that totally disrespected me. I spent a lot of money to stay here and I was disgusted by the treatment I received in return.

Great sandwiches. Service is excellent and they have a wide variety of sandwiches, hot and cold.  Will revisit again in the near future.

I stayed here while I was searching for a house and I was kicked out because my payment was late one afternoon. I stayed here for about 1 month and I paid rent everyday on time. The manager also knew that my room was full of my personal belongings, so to be kicked out with no transportation setup to move me would be virtually impossible. As a result of that Half of my belongings were stolen. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone. Do not bring a lot of things with you and do not stay too long. And it is best to have a vehicle when you do stay. They also raised the rate without notification.

The service is great here, however everything on the buffet is not great. The crab legs were small and they were sitting in water. Crab legs should be stemmed, not boiled in water. I do not like the old dirty carpet in the dining area. It made me lose my appetite. Besides that I probably will not go back unless I am famished.

Do not rent a storage space from these people. They are thieves and every time I went to visit my storage unit my things were not in the same place where I left them. Plus my unit was very hot with terrible lighting. It gave me the creeps every time I had to go there.

I was let down when I arrived for dinner here. My fish patties were over-cooked. When my dinner finally arrived the black beans were cold and the rice was hard and cold, and the chicken that came with my meal was not that great either. When I got home I had to use the bathroom immediately.
