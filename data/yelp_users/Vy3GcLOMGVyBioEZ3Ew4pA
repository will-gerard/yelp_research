This has become our Saturday morning, post Weight  Watchers meeting, breakfast hangout. Love the Nurse's breakfast, my fiancée typically gets the breakfast tacos. Good service, front patio is nice, the side patio is too cramped for my taste. Parking can be tight during peak hours so carpool if possible.

My in-laws are snowbirds, with a 2nd home in Phoenix.  Trying to score some 'what-an-awesome-guy-our-daughter-married' points, we made the trip from Phoenix to North Las Vegas to get their condo ready and the car out of storage.  Though the online appointment I booked didn't go through, they fit me in quickly as a walk-in, ran the initial smog check and fully inspected the vehicle systems - all for the price of the smog check.  I particularly appreciated the detailed list of items that needed to be address that included a triage type listing of what would need to be done with the car down the road.  They could have told me the wheels were about to fall off, they could have gouged me with a huge bill - they didn't do either.  Sitting there I noticed that one of their biggest assets is Marty at the front desk. She skillfully juggled the phones, new customers, and obvious 'regulars' - making sure that everyone felt like they were the most important customer in the world.  I cannot say enough about this fine team and their 'can-do' attitude except to say that I wish they were in Phoenix.

Food is decent but the place needs to staff up to handle the rather brisk takeout business. Tables around us were left dirty, entrees were delivered several minutes apart, and our waiter was very distracted by the phone orders he had to take.  Again, the food is good but the dining room service was awful.

Decent pies and salads, amazing service tableside. The entire staff was friendly and very committed to clearing the table of unnecessary dishes, checking in with us to see if we needed anything else and even offered us a Halloween candy treat. Bravo Zulu...

If you are looking for a speedy dining experience, then go elsewhere. We weren't and gleefully drove the 40 miles to get here for dinner.  The staff sets the standard for personal, professional service. The dining  environment is warm, inviting, and tastefully decorated with local art.  The food is the star and worth the wait and slowing down to enjoy each and every bite.  We have been here for brunch, dinners, and even hosted a dinner party for 50 (in the private dining room upstairs) and never been disappointed.  My only hit on the place is that they apparently don't take American Express - plan appropriately to avoid some embarrassment when the check arrives.

Decent date night staple. This location has a great small neighborhood vibe about it which we appreciate.

A date night staple...this feels like a neighborhood joint. The staff is always friendly, the place is always clean with decent music playing and a great family feel about it (kids program on one TV and the football game on the other).

Went here for brunch this morning and it was so worth it. My fiancée had the Farmers Breaky and I enjoyed the FML Burrito (plus a side of bacon). Great food all around - good service and a great dining area.

This has become our goto spot for Sunday brunch. Be sure to sit on the patio on the nicer days. Trust us,  the traffic noise will disappear the further you get into the meal.

I like this place but, there are only two water fountains that seem to be 'out of order' a lot of the time. Other locations do not seem to have this issue so maybe it is just a ploy to have us buy more of their drinks from the cooler.   I would give this location five stars if they would pay their water bill.

This place has some amazing potential...my wife and I wanted sushi but, didn't want to drive all the easy to Chandler to get to our usual haunt.   Though pretty empty, the service was spot on and the food was pretty decent. This is a hidden gem and we hope the neighborhood will make an effort to support this newly opened joint.

Bought tickets to see Dreadpool, thinking that it would be worth it to pay more for the reserved seat and better concession selection.  This was, by far, the worst experience in any Harkins I have ever had.  Though they appeared to have plenty of staff, most were standing around or working cross-purposes. When I approached a manager to share my concern, they told me it was to be expected as it was shift change.  He didn't hop behind the counter, didn't talk to any of the resources to try and redistribute team members, basically our concern was totally ignored.  Not worth the extra money. Total fail

Wasn't real happy when First Watch bought The Good Egg. The attitude of the staff has just gone down hill. This morning the person at the host's table didn't greet us but basically just said "And you?" Then he huffed and dropped stuff on the table when we asked for a different table. Factor in a menu we aren't thrilled with, attitude, and the temper tantrum this morning, we are done. We are now at US Egg and were greeted with a smile and a good morning. #firstwatch #usegg #useggrules #notcomingbackfirstwatch #votedwithourwallet
