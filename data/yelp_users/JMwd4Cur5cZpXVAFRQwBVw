I LOVE Hot Bagels. Always friendly service, excellent food breakfast or lunch.  It's always a treat when I pick up Hot Bagels for the family for breakfast. I highly recommend.

Dr. Winston is an amazing vet. I highly recommend him. He cares about the animals he treats and their caretakers.  My parent's dog River had unusual symptoms and had seen another vet and a specialist without answers. Dr. Winston was the one who ended up diagnosing him, which saved his life. He began with the simplest and least invasive and was able to learn what was making him sick and it was easily treatable. He is honest, kind, and just really knows his field. I also foster kittens for a rescue and some come in sick with unknown histories. We always take them to Dr. Winston, as far as kittens go, there is no one who knows how to diagnose and treat them better than he does.

I have visited this winery twice and I really enjoyed it both times. We came for wine tasting and appetizers and they did not disappoint! What a funky little place, great atmosphere. My favorite was Summer Rain. I took home a bottle of this for Mom with a special mother's day label. I recommend the warmed brie appetizer, excellent!  What a fun way to spend time with friends and enjoy good wine. I would definitely come back again. The staff was very friendly and made our experience a lot of fun.

I really look forward to this event every year, this was my fifth year running the half marathon. While the scenery is ok (city) they can't help that Phoenix just isn't scenic. However, they do make sure we are safe and have fun. The course is well marked, with plenty of drink stations and awesome volunteers. I had a great time this year as I have every year. I will run it again next year.

I love, love, love this place!  The outdoor patio is a great place to have dinner and drinks. Fantastic Bruschetta. Every kind you can imagine. The Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone is my favorite but you can't go wrong with any of them. Also great homemade soup.  Fun atmosphere for a couple or even a group. Love the ambiance. Friendly service.

A huge waste of money. Summer camp was not what they promised it to be. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMP FOR YOUR KIDS! They hire very young, inexperienced people who are not equipped to deal with kids. Snippy lifeguards don't make camp fun.  Every day he was there they ended well before 4pm and the kids just had to sit and it's 110 degrees out. My son was miserable. We ended camp early and the park refused to refund a cent.  Not the first time we have run in to rude employees. We had an issue one year with annual passes, they gave us regular ones even though I purchased gold. When I let them know, they told me I didn't buy them. The confirmation in my hand showed gold. I had to go to guest services to correct such an obvious error because they couldn't be bothered in the annual pass line. I had hoped things had improved so after a year off we tried it again. On our first visit this year, I waited 25 minutes in a food line that showed a menu that included several items that they no longer served so it was a waste of 25 minutes and the employee was not very nice when he told me they don't have chicken ceasar salads (despite menu showing they do). The chicken breast was a gray piece of something that didn't resemble chicken so I moved over to the pizza line figuring it to be "safe" and waited another 15 minutes for pizza that was barely edible. After very LONG lines on the rides in the hot sun, the last thing I wanted to do was wait 40 minutes for terrible food. I doubt we will be back even though I purchased the annual pass and meal plan so a waste of several hundred dollars. Save your money!

We signed our dog up for the beginner class. He is a 6 1/2 year old Boxer. They do not learn things easily. We got him as a stray at a year and a half and he obviously did not have any training and we tried on our own but he has a mind of his own and we learned that we were not going about things right. Our dog learned a lot, and so did we.  Dawn the trainer is very knowledgeable and extremely caring, and what we enjoyed most was her style. She helped us with our biggest challenges and we see a huge difference in our dog especially with the "leave it" command which we found can apply to anything (our shoes, the cats, food, etc.).  We will be coming back for intermediate classes.

I am not a fan of Phoenix Children's Hospital. Watch out if you ask for a second opinion. Doctors here do not appreciate that and will become heavy handed. The cleanliness of this place is below par. Nurses are overworked and snap at patients. Doctors here believe they are God and will intimidate parents to do it their way or threaten (or actually) call authorities. Horrible place! They have a reputation for taking children away.

Wow! Very rude staff. "Kendra" has no idea how to treat customers. The prices are very high, I ended up going to Celebrity down the street and received great service and lower prices.  They mark up their lotions pretty high, check out Amazon and you can buy any of those lotions for 25%-50% of what Pure Tan charges you. I ended up overhearing a customer ask how many "beds" they have the girl said "how many do you think you have?" what's this? Answer the question. Then she tried to sell more. Hmmm??? I walked out. Too much money to spend to be treated like that. I'm glad I did the beds at Celebrity were much better!

Very unhappy with this branch and subsequent attempts to get "customer service" afterward. I made a cash deposit on a Friday morning with a teller inside the bank, by Monday morning it was still showing "processing". I knew something was wrong so I called the customer service number and was told this was "perfectly normal" and that I came in Saturday not Friday. I had the receipt with Friday's date I explained so clearly something delayed it and I'd like to know what. She made something up, saying "if the teller doesn't balance her drawer by 2pm Friday, it will go in on Saturday". That's not what is posted, it says deposits before 8pm are posted same day this was 9am, in plenty of time. I asked for her supervisor who got angry and said "it's fine it will be processed tonight" and she literally started yelling at me and finally she hung up on me. I called back, got a nicer supervisor who said this was "caught and corrected" on Saturday but she could not tell why so she called the banking center. No answer. So she told me to call back later. I tried the banking center several times that day, no one answered. Sigh....I had to call the customer service number back and explain AGAIN my entire story. The representative insisted I must have deposited the money Saturday. I was out of town, I could not have done so. It was Friday. I asked for her supervisor. 2 hours and 4 people later, the supervisor called the banking center and I was told the teller did everything right but there was a "back office error". It would be processed tonight (Monday at midnight). I don't know went wrong but it was a VERY SIMPLE transaction and then subsequent calls I got nothing but lies. This is a very slow center so not sure why they can't keep track of such an easy deposit. I have ZERO confidence in this branch and as a matter of fact for Bank of America as a company as they so easily lied to cover up mistakes. I'll be looking for a new bank!

We love The Greek Pita. Gyros are stuffed with meat, food is always fresh and good. It's very consistent. The staff is very friendly. Recently my son and I ran in last minute, not realizing how late it was getting. It was about 1-2 minutes after closing, I started to turn around and leave because I did not expect to get served, even take-out, after they'd closed. The male staff member, smiled and waved us is. He said they'd be more than happy to serve us. He was not irritated in the least which would be normal under the circumstances. They prepared our food quickly and it was every bit as good as always.  Typically we get the Gyro platter or the Gyro sandwich combo. My husband says the Falafel is some of the best he's had. The restaurant is always clean, food served quickly, and always consistently good. The staff make this place special!

Jack took in my wheel and brand new tire Monday evening, no problem should take a day. After two days no phone call. We have called and called. His shop locked up tight. He has my brand new tire and my wheel. Yet he doesn't think he needs to call back apparently. We have taken the day off work to stand outside his shop in case he rears his head so we can get our property back. No hope he actually fixed this. By the way this was a warranty deal. He fixed the cracked wheel about six months ago. Said that it would hold. I bought new tires and lo and behold there is the crack. It didn't hold. It has a year warranty. We called and called and he finally returned our call and said to bring the wheel back. We took it to him at his shop with the brand new tire. Now he has both and hasn't returned calls. I wonder if this guy is just planning on keeping my property. Well buyer beware. The work did not hold up, so far warranty not honored, and worse he has my property and won't return my call. At this point planning on calling the police and reporting it as theft. Hopefully this guy will actually show up and return my property.

I absolutely love The Yoga Hangout.  As a beginner, they made me feel very welcome and comfortable.  The instructors provide modifications and they really teach to all levels.  The instructors are extremely knowledgeable and very personable. I have tried nearly every class here and its very hard to pick a favorite. I usually go to power flow or barre but the hang class is amazing too. It's the highlight of my day when I go to class, I really look forward to it.  This is also the most reasonably priced yoga studio I have found in the valley.  I highly recommend. it.

The food is amazing!  I ordered the brisket which melted in my mouth. This is literally the best BBQ I have ever tasted. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is due to the wait and lack of seating. This is the problem with being so good. So go early or eat a late lunch and you will be ok. If you go right at 12:00 though you will have a problem if time is of the essence. The owner himself served us and is really friendly. I hope they will move to a larger location soon as clearly they have the best BBQ in town.

I adopted a cat from Little Rascals several years ago and due to her demeanor and health, when it came time to adopt another we wouldn't go anywhere else. We got another cat who was just what we were looking for. Both of these cats are amazing and I love them very much. The first one was saved of the e-list by Little Rascals because she was a kitten and country doesn't bottlefeed them. Thank goodness for the kindness of volunteers who bottlefed her until she was ready to be adopted. The second cat was an adult, returned when his owner needed to return to her home country. Due to regulations she was unable to bring her cat with her. This organization took back the cat after being in this woman's care for nearly a year. Tha's what I love about them.  I had such a great experience that I recommended them to my in-laws who adopted 3 cats from them and my parents who adopted a dog.

This is my second year attending and this year I have to say prices skyrocketed. Folks it really is junk!  $140 for a globe really? C'mon. I had fun going but really spent my time being amazed at how much money vendors thought they could get for really what was junk. $8 for handmade soap like you would find in boutiques for $4. While I enjoyed the artfulness and the creativity, the prices were far to high to be realistic. It's not like it was an original painting, but a mason jar painted plain old blue and they wanted $8. I did not see things flying out of the booths either. So many must have agreed and I don't think this year was as well attended. Frankly, I think the organizers had a great idea but are getting a little greedy with the pricing. They will ruin what was a good thing. Food vendors were great. I had one of the waffles. Quite delicious. I did find a cute t-shirt very reasonably priced (probably the only reasonably priced thing there) and purchased it but other than that I just enjoyed being with friends, and being amazed at the price tags on items that weren't moving.

I was very disappointed. I thought it was awful. Very little flavor and service was slow.  This was a convenient location and the building looked like a Dutch Bros., but quality doesn't come close. I won't be back.

We absolutely love this place and Coach Shannon is amazing. He's the real deal.  Both my husband and son take lessons here. Coach is great with the kids. Every one always claims my son has no concentration, not in his class.  He is 110% focused here.  My daughter has also taken private lessons with him and has learned a lot in just a short time. This is a great place and our whole family recommends it for adults and children.

Very friendly owners and staff. Always greeted when we come in. Thrifty ice cream is simply the best and the cost is very reasonable. We love the alkaline water, which has so many benefits. The store is always very clean.  We actually enjoy going to get water, well the ice cream makes it even nicer!
