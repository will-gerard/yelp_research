I love Baja Fresh. So good. Their beef and chicken are hormone free which is plus. Fresh food and great prices. Not the friendliest or best service/ staff there, but what can you do? Its close to be fast food, but fresh fast food.  I usually get the nacho burrito, which I saw about 10 other people order while I was there today. I was with a friend. He ordered a 2 taco plate. They forgot to put his order in. Eek. Bad, Baja Fresh. Disappointment!!! He got coupons for next time he visits. Good save there, Baja Fresh. Otherwise this review would be very low. I despise bad service.  I hate chains usually, but this place is always fantastic. I like the fresh food, always delicious.

I've been here twice and have gotten terrible service both times. I don't understand how some of the employees even have jobs, let alone at an auto store. They know nothing about automobiles. I will walk around the store, no one there to help. I wait at the front for help and get ignored for a while.  About a week or 2 ago, I went in to buy transmission fluid. I asked where I could find it. They just pointed. I actually had to ask them to show me instead of just pointing. Come on now, what kind of customer service is that? Pointing doesn't tell me anything.   Today I went in to buy a few things. I found the other items I was looking for, but I mostly was there to buy a box of multiple fuses. I wanted the employee to look up what box of multiple fuses I should buy for my vehicle. She looked in the computer and asked what I needed them for. I told her multiple things, so I need multiple fuses. She told me to hold on so she could ask someone else. Really? You have a computer giving you this info right in front of you.  Some other lady comes to help me. She wants to go out and look at my fuses. Yeah, ok, I guess that works. So, we go out. She tells me I have no cover for my fuse box, so I will need a book. Yeah, thanks, I have one. She tells me I am missing TONS of fuses. We go back in, she hands me a box of fuses, plus tells me I will need to buy a separate set of fuses that aren't included in this multipack set.  Awesome, thanks for your help.  I get home, change clothes, get down there and start looking at my fuses. First: there is no cover for where my fuses are. There isn't supposed to be. 2nd: I don't need the book, the fuses are listed right there. 3rd: I'm missing 2 fuses. Not a bunch like she claimed. 4th: The 2nd thing of fuses she said I needed, are not needed and don't go anywhere. WTF?  Also, she saw that I had no stereo. She laughed at me thinking I was installing one myself. Um, RUDE. Just because she thinks she knows so much about vehicles, which she clearly DOES NOT, doesn't mean I don't know about electronics and car stereos. Which, I don't, but she doesn't know this. My friend was installing it for me. But to laugh at me and question me. Really?  The people who work here know nothing about vehicles. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them to sell me the right things needed for a vehicle or to ever diagnose any kind of issues with a vehicle.  They are rude, not very helpful, and have no knowledge of their jobs. Sad.

I never crave Chinese food. It just isn't something I think about.  But I love this place. I've never had bad food from here. I've had it probably 20 times. And I do crave this place.  Yeah, they're a bit rude over the phone. And you can't eat in or get it delivered. So, you have to pick it up, and wait outside until your food is done.  1 times out of the 20, they messed up my order.  I got another friend that comes to my house so we can order from here. Everyone I know that has eaten their food, loves it.  Huge portions. 1 meal is usually 3 meals for me.

I live pretty close to Ace. I would rather go here then to Lowes or Home Depot. I was at another Ace in Scottsdale last week and was pretty disappointed with service there as they were not helpful at all.  This Ace though, they are very helpful, every time I have ever gone in there. Today I was there to buy stuff to put an above ground pool up that I had just bought. So I needed a tarp, sand, chlorine and a few other thing. I wish I had got the gentlemans name, but he was so helpful. He walked around the entire store with me, showing me everything I needed, doing math, figuring how much of this I needed, etc. GREAT service!!  The only thing bad about this shopping trip was that I purchased a new propane tank and then found out they had none. On Memorial Day weekend. Uh ohs. They gave me my money back and told me Frys would have it. That was another trip I really didn't want to make, but it turned out to be ok because I wanted cucumbers and asparagus.   All in all, I will keep going back. There prices are also way better for chlorine, tarps and propane then other places I shopped at. There propane price is $7 less than the Ace off of Scottsdale Rd next to the post office.

Great food, wonderful service, fair prices. Always hot fresh chips and delicious salsa waiting for you. Drinks are always refilled. Attentive staff. What could be better?   I love the decor, but my kitchen is also decorated with the chili peppers. :)   I've eaten here 3 times now, each time has completely satisfied my tummy, taste buds and my dislike for bad service. This means, I will keep going back and bring new people to try it out!!

I love this place. I used to live right by Mi Pueblo. Now I don't get to eat here often because I live so far away.   The food is great. The service is great. I have never had a bad experience in the 7 or 8 years I have been going here. I have brought a bunch of friends to this place if we happen to be looking for something to eat in the area, and they have always enjoyed their meals as well.

I used to really enjoy this place and have had tons of fun here. Cheap drinks, enjoy some of the staff, good specials, trashy and divey. I enjoy all those things. After the last couple visits, but especially tonight, I'm sure I won't be back.  Me and one of my girlfriends wanted to go get a beer and a bite to eat after work tonight. I suggested Dos Gringos. She got there first and said they didn't appear to be open. Hm, weird. So I said the Vine. We used to frequent this place often, but now its once in a blue moon.  It was pretty dead inside, which we were ok with. We sat at the bar. We ordered our beers and asked for menus. She ordered the special of chicken fingers and fries, I got a 1/2 order of nachos with chicken added. The food came out pretty fast, which was nice. We were hungry. My friend seemed to enjoy her food. Mine, oh man... These have got to be the worst nachos I've ever seen in my entire life. It was basically chips with big pieces of chewy, dry, bland chicken on top with salsa and sour cream on the side. Very  little chips and salsa on the side. To find a chip with cheese or refried beans on it was very rare. How can you fuck up nachos??? I'm not sure, but they did. Badly.  So yeah, food totally sucked. I ate it. What sucks worse then having terrible food when this hungry? Shit service. In a dead bar. Yes, that happened as well.  Absolutely awful service tonight. I didn't even want to tip the guy, but I did. Yes, I ate my food (or a quarter of it), but I did feel it necessary to mention how much I didn't enjoy it, he didn't give 2 shits. He said with a smartass voice that he was sorry with his back turned and walking away from me. Ugh. I'm so angry at The Vine for allowing such low standards when it used to be a great place to go. $13 with tip for 1 beer and the worst nachos I've ever put in my mouth is way too much money!!!! I've decided at the end, right now, me returning won't happen for sure. I don't deal well with bad service like that!

I love Fry's. I really do. Way better then Best Buy for so many reasons. I can spend hours in the store and I'm not even that big of a nerd. Started my trip tonight by looking at video games. Almost bought one, but I decided not to. I was here for a reason.  Next stop is car stereos. I've been wanting a new one with an aux connection. Now they have aux connections and usb in stereos? Amazing! Where have I been? Took about 15 minutes for someone to come and assist me with looking at the car stereos and tell me which one would work best. I know these employees have to make commission, but I was impressed that he did not try to sell me something I didn't need or want. He actually recommended a very low cost stereo for me.  Satisfied.  Next, networking. I needed a few items. I needed a wireless router. Well I was told by a friend beforehand which router I should get  (I sure love knowing lots of nerds). This guy is trying to sell me something else that is $40 more. I live in a fairly small house. I'm typically in the living room. I have no need for a huge router. Then he tries to sell me another brand, because its sells more. He couldn't explain to me why it is better, it has the same specs, its just a better seller. Then he starts to tell me about his at home. Still can't explain why it could be better. Ok, no thanks, I will stick with the one that has already been recommended to me by someone who knows what they are talking about. Next, I need a cord. A VGA to a RGB with audio. He starts searching in a bunch of aisles, asking other people for help. He can't find it. I show him a link and picture from their website, searches some more. Nope, not happening.  Asks me if I've looked in some other part of the store. No, I haven't. Maybe he should help me with that. Probably not.  Next, I would like an external hard drive. Simple enough. Ok. go over there. Starts showing me one that is $170. Its 500 gigs. Well, look, there's the same brand, same gigs for $100, just smaller, thinner, cuter. What's different mister employee? Why such a price difference. He has no idea. Whatever, I will just pick this one. His answer to almost everything is that I can return it if I need to. Why should I have to waste my time bringing something back and returning it? Shouldn't I just get the right answers right now?  Ok, I'm done shopping. I could spend more in this wonderful store, but I should be getting home. He brings me up front to check out, and so I don't have to wait in line. He's gonna make sure he gets his commission and no one else tries to take it.  Almost done checking out when another employee, obviously a friend of his walks up and starts laughing about selling something. It sounds as if they are mocking a customer for buying something ridiculous and overpriced perhaps. They are talking about the money they are making and how cute the lady customer was. They walk away, I mention to the cashier how rude, inappropriate and unprofessional all that was to do in front of a customer. She didn't give 2 shits what I had to say either.  I will return, because it is one of the most amazing places ever, however, beware of the employees. They suck. They are commissioned. They will try to sell you things you don't need, don't want and are too pricey. Try and go in there knowing what you want already. You won't get very good answers because the employees have no idea what they are talking about. I'm hoping you will  have a nerdy friend. Do research online first, ask a friend, or shop somewhere else if you truly have no idea.

I don't understand the great reviews for this place. I went here on a nice evening and decided to sit outside. The atmosphere outside is alright. Cute little old house set up. Big deal.  The service is horrible and our waitress didn't seem to listen at all. We ordered some bruschetta. It was ok at best. We then said we were probably interested in trying the lasagna, but to come back in a few more minutes. We told her we changed our minds on the lasagna and wanted to share a four cheese pizza. About 5 minutes later, we get lasagna. She said sorry it came out so fast and the pizza would be out in 10 minutes. We decided it wasn't such a huge deal and we could take that home. However, it is totally rude for one person to get their food and not the other person. Who does that?? We then get our pizza.  On to the awful food. Like I said, the bruschetta was ok. Postinos is 100 times better. The lasagna, we just boxed. My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was horrible. I make much better at home, and this was some extra special dish they had. The pizza.......oh my. It SERIOUSLY tasted like I took a bunch of cheese and melted it in the microwave. It was some of the worst pizza I have ever had.  I will never go back. Horrible service and horrible food. I don't get why they have such good reviews. Maybe because it is in downtown and its a cool place to go hang out. Go to Angels Trumpet.

Decided to try this place with a girlfriend and have some dinner and drinks. I've heard a lot about the place and I work really close to it, although I didn't know exactly where it was.  It is really confusing getting there when looking at GPS. You kind of already have to know where this place is to go there. Whichever, we found it.  I had the spicy chicken breast sandwich. It was really good. My french fries were cold when they came out. A bit disappointing for how pricey a sandwich is. I told my server and he ran straight back and got me some hot fries. My girlfriend had the chicken tortilla soup. I tried a bite. Oh, the flavors in this were amazing. So good. She also had an asada street taco. Smallest taco with the biggest price! It was too spicy for her until she took the peppers off. But otherwise, she thought it was pretty tasty.  The beer, oh the beer. I love beer. The beer menu and the beers on tap is the amazing part of this place. Over 130 beers on tap! Love it. I was feeling fruity so I tried a Four Peaks Arizona Peach and a Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Bluberry. Both were very good. My girlfriend got a House Honey Blonde and a House Belgian Amber Tripel. Both of those were delicious as well. That is the best part of this place.  They did have sports going on, but I'm not into basketball, so that didn't do it for me at the moment. Maybe if it was some hockey going, I would have been into staying longer.  The service was excellent. Our server was always there asking if we needed anything else. Totally on top of it.  Too highly priced. A sandwich and 2 beers for over $30 with tip is too rich for my blood. I'm sure I will visit again. It was a pleasant experience. Great beers, good food and great service, just way too expensive.

This is my all time favorite restaurant of all times. If I were on death row, my last meal would be from here. If I were ever going to get married, I would  have them cater for me. I never went to Bobby McGees unfortunately, but I have been eating at Bobby Qs since it became Bobby Qs. I have never had a bad meal, nor have I seen anyone else not enjoy their meal. I have never had bad service, or even mediocre service. The food and service have always been excellent, above average, wonderful.  I can't say how many times I have been here over the past many years. I used to go at least once a month as it was me and someones date restaurant for a long time. Every time someone visits from out of town, I bring them there. They always request to go back when they are visiting again. I've brought dates to this place, they have always loved it. When I talk to someone else about Bobby Qs, and they've had it in the past, they always say they love it too. I even met someone from out of town that said they go all over the country to eat BBQ and Bobby Qs had their favorite ribs of anywhere they've ever been to!  I've been to going away parties, birthday parties, tons of stuff, and I've still never met anyone to complain about this place.  The only complaints I've ever heard is of the club. Who cares about the club? This is about the restaurant, the food, the service. Not some dance club where some teeny bopper got in a fight with her boyfriend so they had a bad night so they are going to complain about Bobby Qs. Come on now!  Try the amazing, phenomenal food that Bobby Qs is!! The cornbread is great, the nice donuts they give you as you're leaving are delicious and the spicy bbq sauce is my favorite. I like that they sell their bbq sauce so I can have it at home too! It feels comfortable inside as well, the decor is nice. The outside patio is a great spot when the weather is nice. My dad lives 1800 miles away and is always asking me if I've eaten there recently and to take pictures of the outside water chains so he can replicate that at his house.

I have been going to Wag N Wash since they opened. They have always been so helpful and kind. They are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. I have other resources to buy toys and beds, but I will always buy my pets food there. They carry high quality foods, which is what your pets should be eating!!!  I love the bakery they have where you can buy fresh treats for the pups. I don't give my dogs many treats, but I do spoil them at times with treats from Wag N Wash. I even got my lab a birthday cake there once. He loved it. And so did the other pups at his birthday party. Nerdy, yes. But it was fun either way.  I have used the bathing area a few times for my lab. Its kept very clean, they have great products and the staff has always been willing to help out. The only bad experience I had with that is they wouldn't let me do my dogs nails. They wanted me to pay the groomer. Well, I am a groomer, I'm not going to pay someone else. But I understand, that is their policy.  I am always greeted warmly when coming in, helped while I am in the store, and always asked if I need help to my car. They even stayed open 5 minutes late for me once since I live so far away from them. You will not find that at ANY corporate store.  I love this place and will recommend it to anyone!

I have been going to the Cornish Pasty Co since they opened, years and years ago. When they were still serving your pasty in a basket, cheap tables and chairs, no liquor license, you always saw the owner there working and the menu was so short.   Oh, how its grown, and I love it even more now. The new expansion is awesome! The beer they have on tap is fantastic, the staff is always welcoming and friendly! They've done such a great job. I recommend this place to everyone and I try to visit at least every couple months or so. Every time someone visits from out of town, I make sure to bring them there. If someone has never heard of it before, I tell them all about it. Many people have been pleased by going after I tell them about it! I've never heard any complaints. I only have 1 of my own, and its never stopped me from returning. I had one bad pasty, too much garlic. I can't say how many times I've visited, but its always been a very enjoyable experience. I will keep returning, keep talking them up and still bring in new visitors with me!!   I love the Royale with Cheese, Cajun Chicken, Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, Pesto Chicken and Rosemary Chicken. I always want to try new ones, but I love getting the ones I know I already love! Oh, and you must try the banoffee pie! I'm not a sweets or dessert person, but oh my, it is to die for!

I can't say enough good things about this vet! As you see with all the other amazing reviews.   I unfortunately had to put my really old kitty to sleep. I work right near this vet office. After doing some research, checking reviews, calling around and stopping in some places, they seemed the most caring and loving. And let me be honest, as a single mom to a toddler, I couldn't afford the in home vet like I had wanted. Their prices are very reasonable!   Dr. Heather and Megan are very wonderful, caring and thorough. As I saw one person mention that their cats hated being there, my cat loved it. She didn't mind the smells or sounds or anything. She was a really chilled out kitty though. But, she wasn't scared being there or anything. They don't rush you. They went on and on about how wonderful my kitty was. They did mention some other options for my really old kitty, but knowing her, I knew it was her time to go. It was a very devastating time to lose a kitty I had for 13 years. They were very kind and loving to me. They even had me come back in to pick up a clay paw print they made for me with my kitties name on it!!   While they were putting her to sleep though, they were just wonderful. Gave me all the time I needed before and after. And she just had the kindest words to speak about my kitty and me. To make the most devastating experience, at least tolerable.   Thank you ladies for being amazing!

I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 1 star. My last experience at Stax was awful! The food is still good. The service was HORRIBLE! There were 4 servers working. If you've been here, the place is pretty small. 4 servers aren't necessary and if there are that many people working, I should be getting waited on hand and foot. That didn't happen. The servers were completely rude and were too busy talking to one of their friends to bother with paying customers. This is totally unacceptable.   We sat down, ordered a beer. We eventually got our order taken. Our food came out and we asked for new beers. I was done eating and still didn't have my beer. I am a slow eater. Yet the friend of the wait staff came in and got a drink and our server was sitting at the table with her, chatting. So was the bartender. I again asked for new drinks and got dirty looks, like I was being rude asking for a drink, at a restaurant. Got my beer. Drank it. Never got my check brought to me. I had to ask for that as well. I excused myself and used the restroom. It was filthy and disgusting. There were no paper towels or toilet paper in the womens restroom. I work a block away from this place. I would love to go in there after work and have some food and beer, but that won't happen. I really do enjoy their food, but I will never spend another penny here. I won't tolerate service this rude and bad.

This place is amazing. Great, friendly service which is the most important in my eyes.  The food is fantastic. Their bruschetta board is so delicious. So many different ones to choose from and they are all great! I've also shared a sandwich with someone and that was amazing as well. Great selection of beers on tap.  My little shih tzu is always welcome too with their dog friendly back porch.  Great ambiance.  They only downside is the parking situation when they are busy.

I would prefer to give 3 1/2 stars.   They have a great beer selection. I ordered the Jive Turkey sandwich. It was really good.   Very cute, intimate place. Which brings me to my biggest complaint. The music was so loud I could barley have a conversation. The nice candles and mood lighting, but blaring music in such a small place just doesn't work.   The service was ok. Not great. Not bad. It seemed to take awhile to get refills on the drinks.   I would definitely go back to try some other food.

Delicious!! I've tried Treehouse Bakery's scrumptious treats many times and I've never been disappointed! I'm so happy they have a shop now where I can go in and grab some cupcakes. I went in on Monday to get some to share with everyone at work on Tuesday. I got churro, vanilla, chocolate and pineapple upside down cupcakes.We decided at work to cut them up and split them so everyone could try them all. We started with the chocolate. Before everyone tried that one, someone was already digging into the churro. Everyone absolutely loved them, as did I. I love the churro, as well as the french toast cupcakes. I'm not vegan or vegetarian. Neither is anyone at work. Doesn't matter. These are so moist and delicious. Love them!!!

Just an update!  Still love this place. I need to visit more often.  But, they did make my daughters very first birthday cake!!!!! It was so yummy and she absolutely loved it.  I didn't want a sugar filled cake for my daughter as I don't think a 1 year old needs to eat that much sugar. They listened to all my concerns and made such an amazing, customized, delicious cake for her!  Completely satisfied customers of Treehouse Bakery and their delicious treats!!

Amazing food. Have no complaints about any of the 10 different things we tried.  Went there for my birthday. Great beer selection!  Pretty good service. Not perfect. But not bad. It was pretty empty in there, so really no excuse.  No military discounts.

DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!!   The worst possible customer service I have ever received.   So, I was told to get an ecig from this place by someone who had recently bought one from them. Been looking to quit smoking and my husband wanted one too.  So, I went to the kiosk they have set up at AZ Mills Mall. I talked to the guy working there. We discussed what would work best for us and talked about prices. The one he was selling me was their most basic model. He told me they are normally $85 but would sell me 2 of them for $80. He said their juices are normally $10 but would sell me some for $5 each. And in the ecigs there is a heating element that needs to be replaced sometimes. I wanted to get a bunch of those since I have to send my husband his ecig overseas and wanted him to have plenty and not run out. So he told me since I was buying in bulk he would give them to me for $2.99 each instead of $5.99 each.   I purchased the stuff, totaling out to $120.00.   The next day, I decided to check out their website to see if they had any different liquids there that they didn't have at the kiosk. I see my ecig I just purchased and clicked on it to see what other colors they had that they didn't have at the kiosk. AND TO MY SURPRISE, they were only $20 a piece on the website. Yes, you read that right. He charged me DOUBLE the price that they sell it for online. This is a LOCAL, SMALL company. I completely understand being able to purchase some things cheaper online and the convenience of being able to view, touch and check a product out in person. But DOUBLE the price????? The liquids are only $5 online and the heating elements are only $1.99. So, once again, got charged more and ripped off there too.   *****Don't worry, the story gets better still*****  So, I call the kiosk number listed on my receipt. I ask to speak to a manager.  I get Frank on the phone and I tell him my situation. His response was (very rudely with tons of attitude in his voice) "And what does that have to do with me?" Excuse me? You are the manager, same company, etc. He told me online you are buying wholesale and this is retail. Um. Bullshit. But ok. So I asked him if I should call the online customer support. Again, very, very rudely he replies "You can do whatever you want." WOW! I then proceeded to tell him how much he sucks at doing his job.   Soooooo, I call the main phone number listed on the website. *Ring, ring....* "Hello?"  Yes, a company listing this number online for a business answers the phone Hello, not the company name. So I asked if this was Vapor Tech, he tells me yes. So, I proceed to tell him about being charged double, blah, blah. He explains that online, you don't get a lifetime warranty and at stores you do. So, I get charged double the price because I get a lifetime warranty? A lifetime warranty for a company that most likely won't be around that long, but ok.   Now, here's the real kicker. So, online you can buy 2 of those ecigs for $40. But I paid that price for 1 because I get a lifetime warranty, right? WELL, the funny part is, if you try to use that lifetime warranty, there is a restocking fee of $19.99. So, for $60, I could buy 3 ecigs online, but instead, I get 1 at the kiosk for $40, then if it breaks I have that awesome lifetime warranty, but I have to pay $20 restocking fee???????????????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?   So, continuing, this guy I'm talking to is the owner of the company. And then I tell him about his rude manager at the kiosk. Yeah, he doesn't give 2 shits. He tells me if I buy any liquids online to let him know and he'd throw a few bottles in there free for me. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and call BULLSHIT right now. If he wanted to resolve the situation, he would have asked for my address right then and shipped some stuff to me.   HORRIBLE, SCAM, PRICE GOUGING, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!
