service was great.  Awesome happy hour that goes everyday until 10pm. $5 drinks $6 wines and all full size appetizers are under ten dollars. Try the guacamole. Crowd a little on the older side few people under 40

Being in the food service industry I definitely overlook things most wouldn't. I've been there on more then a few occasions after work and after tonight i won't go back!  Sat at bar the service was less then mediocre.  Our appetizer came out cold (ravioli)  sent it back it came out more then hot.. microwave?  And when a customer orders decaf coffee you give them decaf.  i clearly got 2 cups of regular because its 5 am and i am wide awake and mad as all get out.  suck service food and staff!  Never ever ever going back. so unacceptable
