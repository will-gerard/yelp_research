I have been to all the RA's in the Valley and this one has been the best by far!!! Went with a friend on Friday night for happy hour, had amazing sushi and drink specials and ended up staying way past happy hour was over because we had the BEST waiter ever!! Our Waiter Shad made our experience at RA so much fun and the service he provided has been some of the best I have experienced in the Valley!! If you go to RA, ask for Shad, you won't be disapointed!!!

Horrible customer service, 3 young guys working tonight one employee says to the other in front of 5 customers that he hates his job. The other kid wouldn't even look at me, he set my sandwich on the counter I said thank you and have a good night...no response and didn't even look in my direction!!! It doesn't kill you to be pleasant to people, have a smile on your face and say thank you!!! So RUDE!!!

I have known Adam for 3 years through a business networking group and he has always demonstrated excellent knowledge on his field. It is hard to find an insurance agent that cares about his clients versus just getting the sale! I highly recommend him if you need life ins or long term care ins!

Every single time I come here they don't have garlic knots, don't have it on your menu if your not going to have them...annoying!!!

Being from WI the dairyland, their product is legit!! I had a scoop of the Vanilla ice cream and the Salted Caramel gelato...heaven!! So creamy and flavorful, reminded me of summers in WI!! Price is absolutely correct for such a premium product!!!
