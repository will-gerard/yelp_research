The food is average to slightly above average. That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.  The problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.  So in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.

It took me over a year and then allowed my wife to convince me to give it a try again. Completely improved experience. I have been there about five times in the last 5 weeks and am happy to say that the service here is vastly improved in every way. I have not seen the incompetent server that ruined my last experience here but the servers we have since then had have all been perfect. Keep it up Cherry Blossom and I'll keep coming back!

My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made.   The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!

Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!

It's been about a year since I last dined here and things have changed and not necessarily for the better.   My wife and I both remembered their burritos as quite enjoyable, with fresh tasty ingredients, sizable without being too much and properly assembled (which makes a big difference if you plan to not eat it with a fork and knife). Well this time, we were in for an awakening when we finally got our burritos (which took about 10 minutes for them to prepare on a not-so-busy afternoon). I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito and my wife ordered the fish burrito. Both burritos were enormous, overstuffed and so poorly wrapped that after one bite, both our burritos fell apart revealing the inner contents to both be lukewarm with unmelted cheese and rather tasteless beans, rice, tons of cabbage and average at best tasting fish. In order to eat our meals, we had do scoop out at least half the contents in order to properly fold the bland tasting tortillas holding this mess together. Neither of us could fathom why Two Hippies hires cooks apparently residing in southern Arizona who don't seem to have a clue as to how a burrito is supposed to be wrapped so I suppose that is an achievement, The whole affair turned out to be a completely unsatisfying sloppy mess, and not one we are likely to repeat at any time soon.  It should be stated in fairness that the counterperson who took our order was enthusiastic and friendly. And the specialty lemonade drinks were good.

I have been going to the Parlor since it first opened and I consider myself a big fan of their food, service and decor all of which is in the upper echelon of the food scene here in Phoenix.   Being a born and bred New Yorker, it is not an easy thing to make me excited about pizza here in the southwest but the pizza at the Parlor makes me a little less homesick for my NYC pizza faves. Simply put, they make a really satisfying pie with a nice thin crust, flavorful cheeses and other fresh ingredients. My only criticism is that sometimes their pie makers do not always find that sweet spot in the oven that allows the bottom of the pizza crust to cook more evenly and insure even crispiness. But this is a minor criticism. I also recommend the ceasar salad and the spinach salad which are both excellent. And their burgers and fries are also of the best in Phoenix. As for dessert, I've had the tiramisu and the chocolate cake and am very impressed with both.  The service has always been consistently good. I've been to Parlor both at peak and off hours and their staff has always been attentive, friendly and prompt. My only criticism has been that they are some times a little too eager to get you the check at the end of the meal. I would rather leisurely sip my coffee and nibble at a dessert without having the server lay down the check next to me while I just begin to do so. But this is a very small issue and considering how unbelievably poor restaurant service can be in this town, I'll take Parlor's overpromptness any day over bad service.  The decor at the Parlor is also worth mentioning. Modern, using some of the old beauty salon features like the barber stools at the pizza bar adds a warm and unpretentious touch.   All in all, the Parlor is always a happy experience which I always look forward to coming back to.

Toast Breakfast Boutique makes me happy in many ways.   First the coffee. There are so many caf√©s around the valley and while some are better than others, none better the quality of the coffee at Toast. It stands above the rest because the beans they use have better depth and complexity of flavor without a hint of bitterness. If you order it hot, it's served with the proper amount of heat without being scalding or tepid. And mind you, it is no real achievement in serving a strong, hot cup of coffee, it is an achievement when it has such rich complex character and is served at the proper temperature without lingering harshness as served at Toast.   Now for the food. I really enjoy their simple yet sophisticated breakfast offerings. Many places can churn out quick egg sandwiches but they usually turn out lacking in something, more often than not, because of substandard ingredients and sloppy preparation. The New York City Egg Sandwich uses fresh ingredients and is served on the best bread in town (choice of ciabatta, croissant or engish muffin) from MJ's. So it's always perfectly prepared and simply delicious. They also serve toast (also from MJ's) with a variety of choices like nutella, or fig jam and mascarpone cheese or English style with egg and baked beans. My current favorite has tomato, cream cheese, gravlax, olive oil and diced onions on sliced ciabatta bread. It's just too good.  The vibe at Toast is hip and relaxed without being pretentious. Any time you walk in you might see hip young students, business professionals, or families with young children or infants. Modern and minimalist but still casual and cozy, it's a great place to stop by, chill out with friends or alone to a great cup of coffee and light breakfast or lunch entrees .   I will be back often.

The food was wonderful! Nothing trendy, not a chain, or anything remotely like one. The atmosphere was a little quirky but who cares? The food was like a Scandinavian grandma would make. Absolutely delicious!  And the chicken schnitzel was to-die-for!

A simple review. Based on two breakfast experiences at Joe's.  Pros:  - The pancakes were very good.  - Croissant egg sandwich was also quite good. Same for the bacon.  Cons:  - Home fried potatoes are so salty, they're inedible. No excuse for this.  - I waited about 20 minutes for a two egg plate with potatoes and toast. The food was fine but the problem was when I received the meal, everything on the plate was luke warm which meant it sat for a while before being brought to me. Not good.  Which brings me too...  - Service and vibe are just plain weird. When you walk in, there's no sign to seat yourself or a hostess to seat you. Are you supposed to read their minds and figure it out yourself? Joe's really doesn't seem to get the customer service thing that professional restaurant owners understand. They seem to have no sense of their customers when they walk in. Both times, I did not feel welcome there by the staff or that my business was appreciated in any way or that they cared if I came back or not. I wouldn't describe the staff there as surly. Just indifferent. To me, Joe's Diner comes across as a business not run by experienced or successful restaurant owners.  Conclusion: I see no overwhelming reason to return. I sooner stand in line for an hour at Matt's than to walk right in and seat myself at Joe's.

A nouveau style of cuisines, Chaka Chaka is a simple restaurant that blends the flavors and textures of Caribbean, New Orleans, and Latin American styles and runs with it. Just go and try the jerk chicken and banana sandwich. Or the egg and chorizo sandwich or their black bean soup or their fried rice. All I can say is that I've eaten there almost a dozen times, and I always leave extremely satisfied. And all the sandwiches are $6 or less.  Chaka Chaka is an on-the-go type of place so you probably won't park yourself there for hours at a time. There's just a few counter table seats inside and some out-door seating and that's it. I highly recommend stopping by and sampling their various selections. I'm reasonably certain that after you do, you'll find yourself craving Chaka Chaka again before long and back there for a return visit. It's a real Phoenix treat!

I am ecstatic about Rice Paper. Finally, a place near downtown that serves Vietnamese spring rolls, pho, noodles and sandwiches with a bar as well. It is not a hole-in-the-wall type of establishment like some of those Vietnamese restaurants on the west side that you get hustled in and out before you know it. Yes, those places are utilitarian, authentic and cheap but they are not FUN to eat or be at for more than 20 minutes. Rice Paper is place to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, sample various delicious menu items and just hang out. The structure it is in has been attractively renovated and designed in an old bungalow, clean, modern yet warm so you feel inclined to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.  The menu at Rice Paper is sushi style in that you are given it with a pencil and check off the items you want. If you go with a few people, you can mix and match the different items and have a Vietnamese meal tapas-style which I love because I enjoy the variety. The items I have tasted (a few of the spring rolls, the garlic noodles, shrimp appetizer, salad) were all fresh, prepared immediately after I ordered them and tasted delicious. The prices are not dirt cheap but reasonable as are the beverages. The servers and hostess were very hospitable, helpful and cared about the needs of their patrons. The food was brought out in a timely fashion (not rushed but not slow). I have been there twice in the 10 days since it has opened and am surprised at how functionally operational Rice Paper is and doesn't seem to be filled with the typical glitches that new restaurants have.  The decor at Rice Paper is modern and clean (like the food). It is small and if what I see there continues, it won't be easy getting a table there during the lunch rush or weekend evenings. But I am absolutely thrilled to have Rice Paper to frequent, hopefully for a long time to come.
