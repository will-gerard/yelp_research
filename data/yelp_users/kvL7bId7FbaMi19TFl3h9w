Pane Bianco is to sandwiches what Pizza Bianco is to pizzas, namely heaven on earth.   Both share Chris Bianco's dedication to using only the freshest, locally-sourced ingredients.  Pane Bianco features home-made bread baked in on-site wood ovens, hand made mozzarella, basil and greens out of Chris's own garden, and high quality meats from locally owned Schneider sausage. You can't get more local, or better quality than this.   Pane Bianco has the added benefit of being a sandwich counter, which means you don't have to wait hours for a taste of deliciousness.  Although as others have mentioned at the lunch peak you may have to wait a few minutes; after all quality can't be rushed.  Take the opportunity to grab a coffee next door, or better yet, get to know your fellow sandwich fanatics--this is how community is built.    If you are looking for an infinite selection of sub-par ingredients, or care more about price than quality, there are several other sandwich shops for you. so please don't bother coming here. And if the idea of ordering along side individuals who don't look like suburban clones scare you, this likely isn't your place either.  Check out one of the approximately 1,912 other sandwich shops in strip-malls throughout the Valley that cater to your tastes.  But if the freshest,and highest quality ingredients, knowledgeable service and authentic surroundings are are important to you, Pane Bianco is your type of place.  And if you do value quality over quantity, and authenticity over generica, but still feel that $8 bucks is a little steep for you in the current economic climate, share with a friend. The portions are generous enough to share and still feel satisfied. (although be sure to snap the chocolate treat for yourself!)

Remember those cool glasses you saw your colleague/friend/date/hot waiter wearing the other day that made you rethink your contact lenses?  Chances are they got them at Sassy.  Sassy Glasses is THE place to go if you want unique and cool frames in any style, from 'button down business' to 'far-outfunky', at a variety of price points.  The owners are knowledgeable and attentive, and most importantly, patient, which is nice, because the offer so many styles to choose from.  Even better Sassy is  a locally owned, independent business, so more of your hard earned money stays in town.  The only downside is that they don't take insurance (directly) and have no optometrist on site, or close by, although they will refer you to one)

Authentic Mexican food in an authentic Mexican barrio.  Yes, it's 'dirty' (although it has yet to fail a health inspection), and yes, it's not in a gentrified neighborhood where every building looks the same,  but it is some of the best 'home-cooked' Mexican you'll get this side of the border.  Personal favorites include the machaca, chorizo, and of course the tortillas.  So if you want great street style Mexican food, this is the place for you,  but if you're uptight drone  who value style over substance stick to the tex-mex joints in your generic suburban strip malls.  Remember to pick up a dozen or so of  their home made tortillas you take with you.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are amongst the best tortillas in the world!

Bobby C's is what a neighborhood pub is all about.  The fact that it serves up soul food and hosts some amazing music is icing on the cake.  But what makes the family owned and operated bar & lounge stand out is the fact that, from the minute you walk it, until you leave, you're treated like a member of their family. with in minuted we were joking and kidding around, a few minutes later, we were being given a tour of the facility, including their overflow seating next door.  Until now, it's been a hidden gem with a loyal following of people into live jazz and R&B, or this looking to sate their southern food cravings.  However, with a light rail stop outside, I predict it will be getting a whole lot more attention, (Hint: it is a must stop venue for any Light Rail pub crawls)

As a proud owner and overhauled of a 1951 Ranch home, I'm a connoisseur of hardware stores in the same way a social media fan is a connoisseur of coffee houses.  As my local hardware store, Walt's is my go to place for my home reno needs.  Sure, I still shop at the big box stores for materials, etc,.  But Walt's can't be beat for those last minute items you forgot you needed, ran out of, or broke.  As well, it's small but well stocked shop is much easier to navigate, and the staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and able to make recommendations about what you need.  Moreover as they are located in a mid century neighborhood, they are familiar with the challenges of dealing with older houses in a way that a lot of the staff in big box stores simply aren't.  So if you are tired of the soulless big box experience, give Walt's a  try next time you need to do something around your home. You won't be disappointed.

Great mix of vintage, and new retro/kitchy items with a rockabilly meets tiki meets kustom flair.  A great place to pick up gifts for the hard to please, a unique flourish for your IKEA dominated home, not to mention some funky clothing.  Their inventory continuously changes, so if nothing catches your fancy one visit, be sure to check in again.  A big plus is the fact that it is a locally owned small business featuring artwork and clothing by local artists and designers.

I finally got an opportunity to check out Go-Kat-Go's new location in the Melrose District, and I must say I'm impressed.  While it doesn't look like they have fully 'moved in' yet, the new location is bigger, and it looks like the store is expanding  it's furniture inventory, while maintaining it's great selection of great vintage and kitschy clothes and home accessories.  They are a welcome addition to the M7 strip, and will only enhance the neighborhood's draw as a great place for treasure seekers.

Lux is a place of enigmatic qualities: hip yet welcoming crowd, industrial yet warm decor, crowded yet cozy atmosphere, busy yet relaxing. Tying these together, however, is its straight up authenticity, top quality coffee and baked goods, and friendly service.  Whether you go for your morning jolt, after lunch desert (esp after a  visit to Pane Bianco next door), afternoon work session, or evening meet-up, Lux always welcomes.  Perhaps my favorite part of Lux is it's patio -- one of the best in town, complete with shade and misters in the summer, and , making it a great place to watch Central Ave roll past you.

The Grand Avenue Tavern is a gem in the middle of an industrial wasteland.  Don't be fooled by the location or exterior of the building, as once you step inside, you'll be transported into an urban oasis.  GAT is a cross between a local pub and a trendy nightclub.  Pub wise, they have all the requisites: a long bar with comfy stools, friendly bartenders who remember you name, and a decent beer select, including Blue Moon and Guinness.  The nightclub vibe comes from the sleek cherry wood and polished steel decor and the DJ spinning tracks.    If the interior is an urban oasis, the outdoor patio is an Mediterranean sanctuary.  Complete with shade sails and misters, it is a great place to hang out, even on a hot summer night.  For those venturing here in the cooler months, they have a huge fireplace to help keep you warm.

Carly's is the quintessential Roosevelt Row bar: vibrant, eclectic, friendly, unpretentious.  They have great beer (including a fantastic rotating tap), solid sandwiches and friendly attentive staff.  To top things of, they are steps away from light rail, which comes in handy when you're running for the last train of the evening.    Like First Fridays, what makes the place great are the electric group of people who hang out here.  As a result, Carly's is a great place to people watch, hang out and engage in weird and wonderful conversations with complete strangers who may just become your best friends.

Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?  Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!)   Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.  All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best.

Retro Ranch (aka Retro Redux) is my go-to place for fun, retro finds.    While they may not have the depth or quality of MCM classic and brand name furniture of places like metro Retro or Red Modern, they do have lots of cool and fun 'off-label' mid century furniture for the 1940s through the 80s that you won't find at the other stores.  They also have a stellar selection of period art, clothing, magazines, home/kitchen accessories and tchotchkes for those who dig the vintage vibe.  Their inventory changes regularly, so be sure to return if you didn't find what you were looking for the first time.  The store is are under new ownership/management and is now called Retro Ranch. Not too much change in type and style of inventory, but the store seems better organized and the 'head wrangler,' Indigo Nielsen is outgoing and helpful, making it a bit more enjoyable place to pursue than it's past incarnation.

I can't believe I've waited so long to review the Roosevelt as it is everything I look for in a bar: amazing beers (and a significant wine list),  great food , friendly staff, and a crowded yet comfortable vibe.  The setting is just about perfect.  A historic house that has been renovated with modern/industrial materials, yet still maintains a sense of authenticity and encourages mingling and meeting new,friends (or just as likely, reconnecting with old ones). And, yes it can get crowded on weekend nights (and especially First Friday), so don't expect a table or seat, but to me, that is part of it's intimate charm.  If you insist on a seat, come during the week, or on an weekend afternoon when the D-Backs aren't in town.  Their tap is a craft beer junkies dream line up.  The cover all the bases: ales, lagers, bocks, stouts etc, including a house beer crafted by my favorite local brewery - Four Peaks.  Better yet, they rotate a few taps on a regular basis and  have a unique 'guest tap' so there is always a mix of the familiar and the new.  If, on the odd chance that nothing on tap meets your fancy, they have over 40 bottled beers to choose from.  The food is where the Roosevelt really shines as a bar, which shouldn't be too much of a surprise, given that the bar is owned by Matt Pool.  As with his breakfast joint, the emphasis here is on familiar, yet high quality comfort food - hot pretzels, roast beef sandwiches, franks and beans, grilled cheese and tomato soups, with a gourmet twist.   Staff are friendly and outgoing, and contrary to other reviews, the crowds is diverse and welcoming -- sure there are the requisite downtown hipsters (esp on First Fridays) and the Scottsdale 'slummers' on Saturdays,  but depending on when you're out, there are also T-Gen scientists, downtown professionals, visiting ASU parents, suburbanites on the way to or from a game, visiting conventioneers and local residents just hanging out.

A refreshing old-school record store that reminds us, in the days of iTunes and mp3's,  that music is first and foremost about friends and community.  Sure it is a tad cramped, but that is because it is chock-full of indie music goodness (along with a selection of some high quality mainstream tracks).    However, in my opinion, more important that event the cd's and vinyl for sale, are the knowledgeable staff and patrons, who are sure to steer you to what you are looking for (even if you didn't know it when you walked in).    It is also a great space to find out about, and buy tickets for local live music.  They also have a wide selection of cool magazines (not just music oriented),  t-shirts and posters.

In-N-Out is the hands down best franchise/chain burger joint around.    A simple no-frills menu means that they can concentrate on providing the freshest, highest quality ingredients, such as crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes,  never frozen patties and fresh cut fries cooked in clean oil.   Also the free refills on drinks is great, especially during summer in Phoenix.  Decor wise, In-N-Out keeps it clean and classic, like the burger joints of yore.    Service is quick and friendly, likely because the the staff are paid higher the minimum wage  For those in the know, there is a 'secret' menu that can be used to customize your orders.  4 out of 5 stars because, it is still a chain after all...

Melrose Pharmacy is my go-to pharmacy.  Not only is it in my neighborhood, it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler.  Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community.  The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake.  They are also lightening quick, dispensing most prescriptions while you wait.  Moreover, they are a FULL  service pharmacy, they also offer delivery (handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death) and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non-prescription drugs and vitamins (often recommending the lower priced generic brand).  In addition, you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products, as well as a selection of snacks, books and small gifts.  Even if you don't need to get a prescription filled, it's worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy.  Better yet, stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music, and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex.

This is a long overdue review, but after having attempted to slow grill my own ribs over weekend, I decided I needed to show appreciation for one of the masters in town.  When I first noticed the funky little box of a building on Indian School a little over a year ago, I wasn't sure what it was, let alone what to expect.  After walking in to the no-frills and being ignored for a bit, I was ready to walk out.  I'm glad I changed my mind.  Yes the service can be a bit slow and some times appear surely, and the decor is bare bones... but this is because they are dedicated to putting all their energy into producing the finest bbq this side of the Kansas. One can imagine places like this spread out through along the highways and small towns in the mid-west and southern states, packed with BBQ loving locals.  Once you get to the counter and get down to the business of placing your order, the service is extremely friendly and helpful (especially for a Canadian transplant, who didn't know the first thing about real BBQ culture)  After getting my order home, all I could say is FAN-TAS-TIC. Smoky, tender pork ribs slathered in an amazing barbecue sauce --  sweet, with a deep yet subtle 'tang'. Frankly, I don't remember what sides I ordered, as i was lost in the meat, saucy goodness.  Overall, a great experience, and while I've yet to return, I will be back one of these days.  After having tried Stacy's, all I can say is I'm a BBQ convert.  Since that fateful day, I've been busy checking out other BBQ joints as well as perfecting my own sauces and techniques (which has given me a deeper appreciation for the mastery of what Stacey and his staff do).  I'll be back.

The Tamale Store made me a believer!  Not having grown up in the Valley, I wasn't exposed to tamales until recently, and I must say my initial impressions were not too favorable. I was ready to chalk up tamales under the category of ethnic food that is more about tradition than taste.  Most of the tamales I'd tasted were bland, mealy affairs of corn skimpily 'stuffed' with under seasons fillings.  Then one day, upon a suggestion from a friend,  I tried a Tamale from the Tamale Store at their kiosk at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market.  Now I'm a believer!    Unlike the tamales sold at most other places in the Valley, the Tamale Store's version consist of the perfectly cooked masa that is fluffy AND flavorful, overflowing with scrumptious fillings. They carry a full range of tamales, from the traditional (beef, green chile, pork, etc) to unique vegetarian combos ( green corn and cream cheese, spinach and mushroom) to delicious dessert choices (blueberry, pumpkin...)   I haven't been to the retail store yet, but they are the highlight of my regular trips to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market. I usually have one to eat on the spot, and take a dozen frozen ones to enjoy at home.

If you are interested in an authentic Italian pasta experience,  PastaBar is the place for you.  On the other hand, if you want heaping portions of over-sauced generic pasta pasta dishes, there are plenty of other 'Italian' joints in the city that will meet your craving...  The food was authentic Italian; from the properly cooked (hint Americans take al dente WAY too far) and salted pasta, to the locally source ingredients, to the serving potions.  In addition, there were a few other authentic touches that brought back found memories of osteria's throughout Italy, such as serving cokes and water in glass bottles and the bread sticks in a package.  Overall, the service is friendly and efficient, although their attention to detail has been so-so the times I have been.  Also, given the unique niche that this place is trying to fill, a bit more initiative from the wait staff could go a long way you make newcomers feel welcome.  As well, I found the vibe of the place a tad off -- I dig all the design elements (especially the paintings!) and what they are trying to achieve, but when they are pulled together, something feels lacking.  (perhaps it is the building itself, as I feel the same way about Turf and Sens)

I've been a few more times since my initial review, and they seem to have he service kinks worked out.  In addition, the vibe seems to be 'working' much better.  I've upgraded my review to reflect this.  PastaBAR is now my favorite downtown restaurant!

I've been on a bit sushi kick lately, after finding that Hana didn't live up to the hype. I was a tad skeptical of the better reviews of Moira, but decided to give it a try, especially since it's in one of my favorite mixed use buildings in downtown Phoenix.  And  I'm glad I did.  From the decor, to the service and most importantly, the quality of the food Moira is a great addition to the downtown scene.  Hana may be a bit more 'traditional' in its approach to sushi, but it holds nothing on Moira in terms of freshness, quality or creativity.   While it isn't the best sushi that I've ever had (need to travel to Vancouver for that) it is the best I've had in Phoenix.   Fresh products prepared with attention and creativity.  The tempura is great, light batted and cooked to let the vegetables stand out, and reflects what is being done in Vancouver, Tokyo, NYC, Hong Kong and other sushi mecca's. Also they have a nice beer selection, including a few from Japanese micro-brewery Hitachino Nest, which makes for a refreshing change from the (Budweser equivalent) Sapparo and Asahi that most Japanese restaurants serve.   A bit of advice for those contemplating ordering sashimi or nigri -- always ask the sushi chef (and not the wait staff) what they recommend that evening -- sushi restaurants are at the mercy of their suppliers in terms of the quality of the daily deliveries,  and the toro that tasted divine last week, may not make the 'cut' this week.

Gallo Blanco, is plain and simply my favorite restaurant in town.  the combination of AMAZING food for breakfast, lunch. dinner or late night nosh, organic modern decor, attentive service and laid back vibe.  The elote callajero (cob of grilled corn topped with paprika & cotija cheese) is close to gastronomic perfection as I've tasted in a long while. The chicharron de queso, (basically a lattice of fried cheese) if further proof of perfection in simplicity.  Their tacos are amazing as well.. basically two bite morsels of deliciousness.  While small, they are also cheap at $2-3 a piece.  3 or 4 of them make a great meal, especially when paired with the elote.  To me however, where Gall Blanco shines is the tortas.  Don't be surprised by their rather plain presentation.  The Naco Torta (roast beef and fried egg), is my favorite, although the Conchinita (braised pork) is a close second.    Breakfast/brunch is also amazing.  The huevo rancheros is the best I've ever had, and their Chilaqules verde is divinity on a plate according to my wife. I haven't tried their entrees/house specials or desserts yet, but if the rest of their menu is any indication, you won't be disappointed  I would be remiss if I didn't mention their bar as well, as this is a great place to hang out.   The inside bar is adjacent to the restaurant and shares that same organic modern decor.    Where Gallo Blanco (and the Clarendon)really shines, however, is their pool and rooftop area. Sitting poolside, you are transported to another world, with soothing waterfalls surrounding a pool decked out in modern multicolored tile mosaics.  The rooftop brings you back to midtown Phoenix in a hurry, as it is nested behind the mid tower high rise corridor, but offers great views of the city skyline with the mountains in the background.  if you time it right, it is a great place place to watch a sunset, or during monsoon season, the storms that ring the valley.   Whether you are sitting by the pool, or taking in the sunsets on the rooftop, be sure to order a Michalada, a refreshing combination of Tecate beer, fresh lime juice with a spiced salted rim.  If wine is more you style, the sangrias (both white and red) are among the best in the valley.  In addition to the food and drinks, Gallo Blanco offers live music a few times a week, as well as an amazing modern take on mariachi/flamenco music and dancing every second Wednesday evening. They also have a pretty amazing Halloween party and a great New Years bash..  all in all, Gallo Blanco has taken the Claredon's cool midtown vibe from a fun place to visit once in a while, to a weekly haunt -- no mean feat in an area with it's share of funky restaurants and cool places to hang out.

I was underwhelmed.  I went for lunch with a friend an sat on the patio. While some of the bohemian 'charm' of Palette was definitely gone, the shaded patio is still a comfortable, welcoming space, even on a 95 degree day. (and perhaps more so, with some of the 'clutter' gone.)  What got to me was the slow and somewhat rude service.  Despite several empty tables, we waited well over 30 minutes for our food, after waiting at least 10 minutes for our order to be taken.  When we asked after our food, we were abruptly told it was coming, only to wait another 10 minutes.  This is unacceptable for a weekday lunch when you have to get back to work.  When the food finally arrived, I was disappointed.  I had the Cola Ham Sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was mediocre and the fries were tepid and greasy.  My colleague had the salad which he seemed to enjoy (although not enough to warrant any comments)  I understand everybody has off days, etc, , so I'll be back, especially to check out the brunch.   It is great to have a locally owned non-corporate restaurant in an historic house with a great patio in downtown Phoenix, so I have high hopes my experience next time will match some of the better reviews on this site.

Lola's is a fantastic addition to the uptown Phoenix community.  The coffee is solid, and the baked goods are stellar, thanks to Danielle from Sweet Pea.  Given their lineage and proximity, comparisons between Lux and Lola and inevitable. Based on my experience and observations,  Lux is the place of choice for Gen Y'ers and Lola is the place for Gen Xers. and Boomers.  As I fit into the second category, my preference is for Lola's.  I find it slightly more relaxed and open -- the windows on the two sides create a light an airy atmosphere, and the layout feels less cluttered.    The music also seems suited to a thirty something crowd... The furniture is a great fit with the mid-century bones of its locations, and the have a great reading selection, including books, magazines and, most importantly, the NYT!  Overall a great place to spend some time working, contemplating the universe, or getting caught up with a friend. 4.45 stars.

Went last night with a table of 6. Had a great time -- got to sample several different pizza's and were impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the toppings -- I loved the sage and sausage combo, and that fact that the pepperoni was actually spicy! Can't say we were blown away by the crust, but it's inauspiciousness allowed the amazing toppings to shine.    We were also impressed with the remodel of the space, in particular the desire to stay true to the mid century bones of the space, while adding a modern, yet organic edge. I loved the reuse of the salon chairs as bar stools, and the vintage photos of the salon next to the washrooms...   One last thing, not sure it was intentional or not, but we enjoyed the $7 pitchers ($2 pints) of PBR -- it brought back fond memories of college.

Awesome location, average coffee, poor ambiance.     While I've never been a huge fan of the original Fair Trade, I was glad to see that at least a locally owned shop was opening up in the Civic Space, but after my first two visits I'm underwhelmed.  Same average coffee and food as the original (although I do give high marks to their Italian Sodas), but ZERO ambiance.  Sorry but patio furniture (uncomfortable at that), does not belong inside a coffee shop.   Hopefully they are waiting for real furniture to arrive, and will migrate the patio furniture outside where it belongs.    Another downside is the fact that the don't seem well set up for studying and co-working. While I'm not a huge fan of computers in coffee shops, they are now ubiquitous and should be well accommodated (especially in a place that will be frequented by university students). As it is, several of the outlets are near the ceiling (sorry but Shaq is no longer in town). Moreover, they don't seem to have their own wifi, but are relying on ASU's connections.  I'll chalk this initial impression up to opening week chaos, and hope that in a few weeks they'll have finished decorating and added some art to warm the place up as well as couches, easy chairs and loungers and some decent bistro tables.

Color me convinced.  When I first heard about the concept of a modern tiki restaurant, I was skeptical.  When I saw the early demo/renovations to the classic uptown building, while hanging out at neighboring Lola's, I was worried.  After stepping inside today, however,  I realized that my skepticism and worries were unwarranted. Hula's Modern Tiki is a great addition to the uptown dining and lounge scene. They have effortlessly matched an uptown modern vibe with a retro tiki kitsch.  The cocktail menu is quite extensive, with a lot of fun options, including Dr. Funk, served in a Fun Man Chu mug and the Tiki Bastard.  They also have a variety of bottle beers, including some choices from the Caribbean and Hawa'ii. Their food is all island inspired, with a hearty collection for seafood based appetizers (pupus) and mains, as well as some other island inspired selections, such as Duke's Luau Pork Plate.  Our food was well flavored, especially my wife's fish tacos.  On the down side, my pork was on the dry side.  To their credit, after mentioning this to the owner, Dana, he took 50% off the entree price).  The servers and staff,  were extremely friendly and attentive, perhaps a little too much so, although i chalk it up to opening night jitters and a full staff fort a less than full house.   Give the cool vibe, great seafood and wide drink selection, Hula's Modern Tiki is set to become an uptown classic, especially as they work out a few remaining kinks in the kitchen.  As you begin migrating out to the patios with the cooler weather, be sure to stop by Hula's-- it's patio, complete with fire pit is a great place to hang out over a cocktail or two, or even more,  given its proximately to the light rail.

Giant Coffee is a welcome addition to the caffeine scene in central Phoenix.  After visiting Matt's Big Breakfast and The Roosevelt, I knew the atmosphere at Giant would be sublime, and I was right. While I had already been inside for a few Merz events and art shows, it was nice to actually sit down with a book and a coffee and experience a cafe like it is meant to be.  The coffees I've had were decent, but no threat to Cartel or Royal (and there is something about importing it from a CA roasters that sits wrong with me), but at least they are making the effort to raise the bar in the central city. However, decent coffee is fine with me, as to me, the drinks themselves are only an excuse to hang out with friends or a good book in cool place.  From the other reviews,It sounds like I may have to give the honey vanilla latte a try... if only they had a loyalty card ;-) Although I could do without the 'price premium' for a toddy (if anything it's easier to make that a regular).    While it won't be my 'go to' coffee joint, it will be a regular stop while visiting the library or Art Museum, freeing myself from the teen scene and blue hair beat crowds of  their respective cafes.  Oh, and shut up already about the 'cash only.' It's quirks like this that remind us we're actually living in a city and not and endless sprawl-topia.  If you only carry cards, there are plenty of Starbucks around.

My favorite coffee in town. While other places may have the speciality beans that wow you every now and then, Royal's self-roasted blend is consistently great--whether it is their hot pour overs or iced toddy.    Hayes and his staff go the extra mile to serve you without the indifference or even worse,coffee talk gobbledygook or condescension of some other places.    I love the urban, adaptive-use nature of the place with  modern yet organic, custom made furniture.  Best yet, it has become a hub for downtown denizens and urbanites. I never fail to see a familiar face when I stop by. It's a great way to remain connected with the who what when and where of downtown Phoenix.

After a few visits to CityScape, Phoenix's supposedly 'exciting urban infill' development, i must say it is even worse that I expected.  Far from being an authentic urban development that takes into account the surrounding urban fabric, it is yet another suburban development dropped on our city's downtown core.  I guess I was naive to expect anything different from a project conceived in a Scottsdale business park.  Some observations:  * CityScape's idea of urban form is to place a large-scale suburban pharmacy on one corner of the development and an elevator lobby on another corner. So much for encouraging an active street life or pedestrian activity downtown.  * The supposed 'park' to replace the publicly owned Patriots Park, is not really a park, but an outdoor arcade on private property surrounded by buildings. Basically, this 'park' is designed for the office dwellers and patrons of the complex, NOT the citizens and residents of downtown Phoenix.    * While I don't have a problem with Oakville Grocery per se (especially if it keeps its promise to stock locally produced goods), I do take issue with is the conceit that it is a 'grocery store' that will meet the needs of downtown residents.  There is only so much demand for handmade cheeses and gourmet sandwiches in downtown (and besides the Phoenix Public Market already offers these items and more.)  CityScape represents yet another failed attempt to revitalize downtown. It is basically a morphing of downtown's last two failed 'urban infill' attempts:  Collier Center and Arizona Center. Both these were supposed to enhance downtown's urban fabric. Both failed miserably at this goal.  The various civic 'leaders' who continue to push such misguided projects need to wake up. Instead of facilitating a downtown that ALL residents can enjoy, they have continued on the futile quest to keep suburbanites and tourists downtown after ball games or conventions by creating a suburban haven in the middle of the city.  These so-called leaders need to realize that what's needed downtown isn't foisting another new mega-project on us.  Rather, we as a broad-based community need to radically rethink how we approach development. Until that happen, Phoenix will never realize the potential of being 'Arizona's Urban Heart."  Developments such as Cityscape don't take us closer to a true downtown; they move us further away.  In Phoenix's desperate attempt to attract suburban tourists, downtown is morphing into a suburb itself.

Cityscape continues to represent all that is wrong with Phoenix: artificial, ignorant of its site and isolated from it's surroundings. Despite being promoted as the centerpiece of downtowns re-re-re-revitalization, the development has yet to deliver. Hopes of residential units have been delayed--if not dashed, the anticipated grocery store (high-end or otherwise) has yet to open, high-profile local businesses have pulled out and national chains have reduced hours or laid off staff.  Not only is Cityscape blatantly anti-city and anti-urban; it doesn't even compare well with its suburban competition. From the inside there is no there there. Patriots Square is still a concrete mess, the exterior windows are still covered and the few businesses have minimal signage, their glazed windows make it difficult to see what's inside (particularly on the upper levels).  Boosters of CityScape may like the convenience of the parking, the sterility cleanliness, the security (read homeless patrol) and the excitement that occurs during peak moments. What they don't comment on is the emptiness that pervades the development between these rare events. They also seem to be immune to the banal architecture and it's isolation from the rest of downtown, highlighted by the contemptuously blank walls facing large swathes of Jefferson and Washington. Sure, CityScape may be better than 'nothing,' but do we really want to set the bar so low?  To be fair, I do like a few of the tenants especially the newly opened Arrogant Butcher and even the franchised Jimmy Johns. I'm happy that downtown finally has a pharmacy. However they are not enough. Indeed, I wish that they were the exception that proves the rule, and not the rule themselves.  These type of businesses should be the lures to get people excited and drawn downtown where they discover locally owner businesses and begin frequenting them. Instead, customers of Jimmy's get to see a competing chain; and Arrogant Butcher diners get a panoramic view of parking lots.  To make things worse for downtown as a whole, the few business that have opened, and several of the office tower tenants could have easily found space. Instead of using public funds (which now make up about half the project's funding) to lure business to CityScape, the city could have helped these businesses settle in downtown's existing urban fabric.  Imagine the Arrogant Butcher and CVS on the ground floor of the incredible Luhr's complex, or Lucky Strike reusing the under appreciated McGinnis Building across from the Duce on South Central? The remaining stores and restraints could have easily fit in the empty store fronts of the Collier Center, Cronkite Building or several other nearby buildings The office tenants could have stayed in the previous downtown locations, or moved to the Luhr's buildingor the former Phelps Dodge offices.  By going this route we now have MORE empty offices and store fronts downtown than ever before. Indeed, CityScape is looking more and more like the Collier Center, with Lucky Strike filling the role of Hard rock; Arrogant Butcher playing Kincaid's and Banner Health acting as Bank of America.  Phoenix needs to learn that while mixed-use is important, a mixed used mega development will never be a substitute for the authentic diversity that grows out of several smaller-scale densely organized projects.  CityScape is a paradox. It was intended to be a bold new form of development downtown, but ended up being a lesser facsimile of the nearby Arizona and Collier Centers.   Perhaps the biggest irony is that while it's name and marketing scream their urban ambitions, CityScape is almost without a sense of urbanism.

The Icehouse is a great example of adaptive use in downtown Phoenix.  From it's origins producing ice used to ship produce farmed in the Valley by rail to eastern consumers, it has be resurrected as a multi-use space.  While first and foremost an art  gallery -- and it's diversity of interior and exterior spaces make it a great place for large scale installation work as well as more intimate showings -- it is also a unique space for all sorts of events from indie rock concerts to corporate fundraisers (and would make an AMAZING place for a wedding ceremony and reception!)
