I have been to Shogun twice in the last 2 months, and love the quality an portions.  Last night they had a classic rock band and threw the happy hour into full force for it..  This was the first night that I ordered anything other than "The cold stuff", and got a teriyaki bowl along with a few pieces of nigiri.  The bowl was great...but once again the big pieces of nigiri style sushi were fantastic.  I have been to Sushi Brokers (good), RA (also good) as well as Satori and a Stingray etc...  Quality wise, Shogun is the best.    BUT  And I love this...but the atmosphere is completely different than any of these other "Trendy" sushi choices.  There isnt a whole lot of ZEN floating around and I think that it used to be a Hibachi style grill in the past.  Still...the bar area is a completely non-pretentious, regular bar.  They also have a sushi bar in the center...but I have just stayed at the bar the two times that I have been there.  Both times I have made great friends up there and the bartender is on top of everything.  It's dimly lit and feels like a regular working class bar with the added gift of the best sushi I have had.   They definitely take their sushi seriously.  Thats a good thing...cause so do I!  See you soon!

Welcome to the only restaurant in the state of AZ that doesn't allow a patron a glass of water with their meal when requested.   "We only have bottled water" I was told. Nice scambo guys. It backfired here this time though.  I left the slice that the cook prepared for me there and found another place to spend my money.   Out of principle, I think I'd stay away from these goofs. They don't deserve your hard earned money.  To further end, I think its the law in Arizona that an establishment must give you a glass of water when asked even if you're not buying anything.  That's part of owning a restaurant in the desert...especially in July.  The manager who instructed employees to do this should be fired.  No questions asked, do not pass go, do not collect $200.   And the young girl with braces who shared this policy with me in such a smug and irreverent manner should be let go too until she learns to question the integrity of a directive.  Would she also "short change a customer" if she'd been instructed to?  Would she do it with the same arrogant demeanor and panache?  I worry that she might.  She didn't flinch when I took my business elsewhere.  She knew beyond question that she was far better than me.  And I shutter to think of the message it sends.  They don't have tap water back there?  How the heck do they wash all of the equipment and utensils when making the food they are serving.  Obviously they didn't think through that response too well???  Look at the bad P.R. you just received for thinking its clever to refuse a paying customer a cup of water in hopes of getting them to pay $2.49 for a .20 cent bottle.  I'd be willing to bet that either you'll have changed this ludicrous policy by the next time I stop next door to get barbecue, tacos or a pretzel OR you'll be closing up shop shortly thereafter.  You guys don't deserve to have my business.  Nor anybody I can share this story with.

The "Five for six til seven" is out of this world.  Enjoy the class of this wonderful restaurant without breaking the bank or go for a sit down dinner or brunch any other time of the day.  This place never lets you down no matter what sort of dining experience you are seeking.    The staff is great and very personalized and have a way of always making you feel special.  The deep wood bar is warm and inviting.

4 words sum it up.  Chicago Style Deep Dish.  This is as close as it gets in this town and you've gotta give them 5 stars for that alone.  I've never understood why nobody does it right out here.  Its not the water no matter what they say.    They don't have sausage patty but the crust is great and the za is super tasty.  If you're done with the artisan style or you just need a good old fashioned "comfort food meal" than go with the Chicago style.  It'll do the trick.

Love love LOVE IT!  I first went here with a friend when I was visiting Scottsdale and now that I live here I go here regularly.  The service is great and they always remember you.  I hadnt been there for a year and the guy bartender welcomed me and even remembered my drink (maybe I drink too much) lol.    Ray is a wonderful host and his band is just great.  Sure enough...I went home and looked at the back of my Lyle Lovett CD's and I think he's on each and every one of them!  How cool!  The music is great and if you like to dance country this is the place.  Lots of sweet people here too and if you are looking to meet new friends, Handlebar J is great for that.  Lastly...the food is awesome.  The BBQ is out of this world and even though the pricing isnt great, the quality is.    See you soon new friends.  Thanks for being exactly what I was looking for in AZ.

Everybody at Horizon is just wonderful.  Stephanie is about the sweetest receptionist in the world with Sonia being a close second.  But the compassion and level of care is what makes them second to none.  I never feel gouged when I leave and have gotten to the point that I don't even ask what its going to cost before any procedures (not that I am advising that).  Its just the level of trust that I have in them.  I have a diabetic Maine Coon that they have taken such care with as well as my other cats.  When I call, I feel like they know me by voice.  In the rare occasions when I missed an appointment there wasn't a question about them charging me.  Its people treating people the way that they'd like to be treated.    What could be more important than having a clinic that treats your family like it was their own?  Nothing.  They are open on Sundays too!  I couldn't ask for a better place to have around the corner.  Thanks!

Authentic street signs!  The guys working here seem like tough south side guys which is sort of weird but thats alright. Still... I've got news for ya. The pizza isn't even close. We can say it's the water or whatever but they even call a pizza "the UNO" and it's a pizza hut special on a bad day. Not even close.  Skimpy crumbled sausage as opposed to patty and a nothing crust. The advertising might fool ya to come there once thinking it's chi style but you won't come back.    I'm not saying that its the worst pizza ever, because its not.  But it certainly isnt Chicago style and its simply mediocre mid-size crust pizza.

These guys have nothing but 5 stars for a reason.    My biggest fear is always getting taken advantage of with services that I know very little about.  When my AC stopped running as expected I feared the worst.  Matt came out and was super low key.  Nice, young guy with a great disposition.  He showed me the part that had blown and showed me what it should look like.  Then 10 minutes later it was fixed.    He still went into my attic and looked at the condenser coil and made certain that the line was blown out properly.  Even when I was getting ready to pay him, he said that he wanted to check the levels first before he was done.    I have little doubt that I could have had my AC fixed any less expensively by anybody else...especially to have it done right the first time.  They've got a future client in me for sure.

I was never excited about bagels before in my life until Big City.  Now I look forward to sneaking over there a few times a week for one of their freshly made delicacies.  BCB is family owned and family run and the kids are just wonderful, hard working people.    I know that they have specials after two for a dozen bagels and they look like they wonderful sandwiches.  All that I know thus far is that the quality of their bagels is second to none.  They are larger than the competitors and prepared better.  The coffee is great, and is self serve.  The store is clean and has about 5 or 6 tables outside so you may enjoy your day or take your dog along for a bite.  I never thought I'd be raving about something as "blah" as a bagel.  But BCB is so much more than that.  Enjoy!

20 years ago I probably would have gone with five stars, but its important that people understand what this is.  First of all, the scenery is wonderful.  I saw wild horses and eagles etc...  But I went on a hot Saturday afternoon, and the wildlife that I saw in the tubes was far more extreme than the wildlife that was on the banks and in the air.  Beware if you bring kids.  I don't have any, so this is seldom a concern of mine but the swearing, cussing, crude behavior (everybody brags about just peeing where they stand) and just out and out "trashy" behavior would really turn off the average guy.    One out of every 50 girls should be wearing the bikini's that are everywhere.  The other 49 should really just wear a normal suit.  Really ladies...there's nothing wrong with a normal bathing suit.  You don't need to compete.  We don't really need to see every one of the tatoos that you have.   But if you keep your eyes open you may see something rarer than a red-headed mockingbird.  There are some very attractive people hidden in the masses.  But some of them may still fool you and you'll realize its a disguise when they open their mouths and you hear "Hey @$$H073...where's the M07&%FU3&I@G cooler at?" Or any one of a number of profanities that really just kind ruin everything.  Plus, its packed.  You can be wrapped up on the river with 50 other tubes on a Saturday.  And if you're not enjoying the company of the people around you, you're kinda stuck with them for a bit.    So beware.  If you're all about being crude and pissing in the water and getting into a fight because some drunk guy didnt like the way that you looked in his direction, then its a great time.  I had a decent time.  I don't have problems with people and I live and let live.  But I wouldnt want to take my niece and nephew.  There's a time and a place for this kind of fun.  If its your kinda thing, do it.  Its a frat party on the river.  Just don't drink the water.

OK...let me start by telling you that I am not done entirely with courses nor have I passed the state exam or anything BUT I am almost done with a 6 week course.  I hadnt been in school for over 20 years...so this whole process is a bit scary for me.  Still...these guys are the best.  I cannot emphasize enough how pleased I am that I chose this school...even to just re-aquaint myself with the entire educational process.  The location is great...the school itself is wonderfully functional.  They have break rooms and stuff which I have no real interest in, but the little things are all in place.  The seats are comfortable and the rooms temperature controlled well.  Lighting is good and visually all is just right...which can be important when you have 70 people or more all sitting in the same room for a session.  Nevertheless, the thing that is most appreciated by me is the teachers.  Each teacher that I have had seems to be a true expert in their field.  I worried that people teaching these courses to subsidize their incomes might not be the most successful of real estate agents since my mistaken philosophy wondered why a successful realtor would bother teaching this crap.  Heres why.  Because they enjoy helping others.  Now isnt that the type of realtor that you would want assisting you with your home purchase of sale anyways?  So before you even realize it you are already being mentored by somebody whom you wish to "do business with"...and the business for this six weeks is learning this exciting field and all the laws, policies, standards and practices associated with it.  And I have news for ya...its fascinating.    I cannot imagine being more impressed with the teaching practices of anybody else more than each and every one of the instructors that I have had.  I can stay alert despite my fears that I wouldnt be able to.  I'm not intimidated to ask questions and participate and there is no fear that "I wont get enough out of" any of the sessions in the 90 hours because I can always just take it again if I like with no added charges.  All that they seem to care about is making sure that I become as well versed an agent as possible.  The course is worth three times what I paid for it, even if I had no intention of using the license for which these classes are intended.  I have learned more about this new and wonderful region of the country than I ever would have otherwise as well as things pertaining to water rights and EPA issues out here.  Plus...I've made some good friends in the process.  I cannot recommend this facility enough!  Once again...I havent cracked a book open in over 20 years but I feel like I am learning and excelling every day here.  Thanks guys!

Greatest sushi find in Scottsdale. Pricing is unbelievable not even taking into account the great location. Nigiri orders $3 for two pieces?  Where do you see that?  Quality is awesome and the staff is great. Atmosphere is...well let's just say retro and if you see it with those eyes your gonna walk out with a five star experience.   I'm so sick of walking out of sushi places feeling like I've just been taken advantage of. You will never walk out of Kyota with that in mind. And the have teppen yaki tables too!  Maybe next time, but as for now I just keep going in for the sushi.

Don't get fooled by their "open ended" pricing.    We had used their service once before (although not sure which franchise) and decided to use them again because they did a decent job.  I have a modest home (2000 SF) which I keep fairly neat and clean.  My folks were coming in town and I wanted it professionally done.  Three girls came out and they were friendly.  They were a half hour late.  They said hello to my cats and I spoke to the "crew captain" (who I later found out has not authority to do anything whatsoever).  I wanted to tie down the price before I wound up with a rotten surprise at the end.  This obviously didnt help.    She said "It looks like about an hour job" to which I told her that the last time I paid "A hundred something..."  She in turn told me that it must have been two hours.  I said "Great...but if you can do it in an hour that would even be better!".  She smiled.    I headed out for some errands so that I could get out of their hair and when I came back in 45 minutes they were proud as peacocks!  "Were done with that whole half of the house!"  They told me.  "You're free to be over there while we finish up."  They pointed to my three bedrooms, den and both of my bathrooms.  They were done with every bedroom and every bathroom that I had!  All that they had left was my kitchen and living room.  I figured that if I pushed they could have been done in the hour, but I was happy to pay that $150 or so that I expected to have the home finished perfectly.  So I went in my office and worked.  I came out 4 or 5 times during the next half hour...figuring that they must be finished by now.  Nope.  They were doing stuff (I didnt pry...its their job).  After they mopped one of the girls kept going around with a backpack thing revacuuming.  I doubt it needed it, but I knew that they were just re-tidying things up despite the fact that they were done.    Finally, I came out and was quite happy with the service.  It looked quite nice.  I got out my checkbook and she told me that it was going to be $198.    I said "What?  I didnt think it was going to be almost $200!"  She seemed accustom to my surprise.  When I told her what I paid last time, she immediately said "Oh.  That must have been a 2 person crew."  Her boss told me two days later that they do not have two person crews!  She was also very well practiced at telling me to call the office if I have any questions.  When I did, the supervisor (Wanda Foss) was gone for the day.  Now I was upset.  I cannot pay $200 to have a well kept 2000 SF house cleaned.  Wanda called be back about 1:30 the following day.  Wanda seemed from the onset to have one goal in mind.  To find where Merry Maids was totally and 100% in the right to keep the full amount charged.  She went back and forth and insisted that unless I had a complaint about the quality of the work that I had no grounds to feel badly.  I wasnt going to lie.  They did a decent job but the price was way out of line ESPECIALLY when I had told the crew chief what I had anticipated paying.  I was then told that the crew chief has nothing to do with it...that they do not quote prices.  She surely had no problem quoting the price at the end of their time at my home!  There was never any logical reason given as to why they were more than half way done with my home after 45 minutes yet it took them another 1:15 to just do the remaining kitchen and living room.  When I suggested that "they must have been dragging their feet in order to take advantage of the time" she was quick to retort that the girls "knew I was in my office that whole time so how would I know that they were dragging their feet?"  If I had my eyes closed and felt the sun shining wouldnt I know that without seeing it Wanda?  OF course I would.  Why?  Because its obvious.  I could tell after "Adversarial Wanda" kept finding faults in my questioning that her role was simply to tell me that they werent about to part with a cent of that money that their fists clenched onto so fiercely.  Merry Maids trying to save a customer by giving back 1/4 of what they collected was out of the question.    She finally conceded that "It must have been a communication breakdown".  I asked if I was to be the only one to suffer because of that.  Still...no chance of her suggesting that they give me $50 back OR EVEN a $50 credit towards next time!    Now we all know that I could (and should) stop payment on that check.  What would you do?  Rather than ponder that question...dont use these crooks.  Worse than getting ripped off is when you get ripped off by an arrogant person.  The last words that Wanda Foss said to me when I told her that there are only three things for certain in this world...death, taxes and that I wont use Merry Maids again was "For somebody who acts so educated, you are sure acting like a big baby."  A big baby because I felt duped and wanted to make things right?  Stay away and do business with people that appreciate you.

OK...I've gotta give it up for G&S.  I finally tried it after I had heard from a few reliable sources that it was the place.  They were sure right.  But before you plan your Saturday night around the place I've gotta be clear that the atmosphere isnt going to blow you away when you walk in the door.  It sits in a strip mall between a pool supply store and a Blockbuster and there isnt any of that fancy new Zen asian stuff going on.  Well...at least not well done.  There are a few tacky fountains and some circa 1985 booths and chairs...but that's not what you're going to be going there for anyway.  So we sit down and and inquire about a Happy Hour.  I guess that they dont do that anymore.  OK.  So our first 5 minutes made us think that maybe we should have done Flo's instead despite the fact that we wanted to finally give this place a try.  So I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that we've gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot.  Two minutes later our waitress tells me that they are out of the noodles so I am already doubting the recommendation.  So I ordered the beef noodles (chow fun) and sat back and waited.  5 minutes later the food comes out.  That was when I figured out why I had heard such magnificent things about George and Sons.  Wow!  The food was amazing!  The portions were wonderful and despite the fact that it tasted so fantastic I still have leftovers for tomorrow (or maybe when I am done with this review tonight!).  Just wonderful!  It was so fresh and so unique in flavor.  You could tell that their "citrus sauce" was the real deal.  It was created there by a cooking genius.  The chow fun was fantastic and although the service was simple...it was wonderful.  No attitude, no ego and very little trendy atmosphere.  Just awesome food in a low key environment.  I will be back!  Oh yeah....I will be back!

First of all, let me start by saying that I have not actually used this company for Scorpion control and hope that I never have to.  Nonetheless, this didn't stop Georgia from spending a good 20 minutes educating me on "how scorpions think" and gave me some GREAT advice.  For free...that's right, for free!  SOS has a database that can give them information on your subdivision pest problems and give you a good idea of what you can expect.  They can even do this before somebody buys a home in an area.  What a great thing!  And from what the reviews obviously share, they can solve your scorpion problem.    I will recommend them, but hopefully never need them.  But if I do, there is little doubt that I won't feel a need to shop around.  Thanks Georgia!

I walked in not really knowing what "California Greek" meant.  My understanding of the definition is "Greek food with an attitude problem".  I tried it last night since I'd tried everything else within a 5 mile radius so it was time to try Daphne's.  I perused the menu and decided to keep it safe on my first visit.  I ordered the Gyros, but I am a little picky with Gyros having enjoyed it all of my life in Chicago.  I made certain to emphasize to the host (who seemed preoccupied with a lot of things) "NO TAZIKI.  Just onions".  I could tell that I might wind up with a sandwich that wasn't right so when he repeated my order I reminded him "No Taziki...only onions."  He replied "no tomatoes or lettuce?"  Hmmm I thought.  They have a pita burger, maybe lettuce would be good on a Gyros, so I told him to put lettuce on there like it were a buger or taco or something like that.  It came out with lettuce with some sort of a Greek, vinagary style salad dressing on it.  This was the last addition I wanted to a Gyros, and you'd think he'd of told me seeing as I obviously didnt want creamy sauces on my sandwich.  It ruined the whole thing...was about as non-traditional as you could imagine and I already felt like an outsider with this guy talking it up with his cook and running all around like he was on speed or something.  Normally I would have addressed it and gotten a new sandwich but for some reason I just didnt even feel like it here.  I ate the Gyros and part of the pita and walked.  I just had a feeling this guy wouldnt be receptive to my problem and frankly, for $6 it wasnt worth it.  It's not like I wanted the place to be good after the aura surrounding me.  It's clean though.  The menu seemed varied and the prices didnt seem bad, but the food didnt seem that good either.  They did have whole wheat pita, but they serve it cold...like right out of the baggie.  It's not toasted or grilled.    At least now I can say that I've tried it, and that I know what California Greek is.  Next time I'm with friends and they say "Hey...that place say's its California Greek.  Should we check it out?" now I know the answer.  So the meal wasnt a total waste.

As far as fast food goes, this place is at the top of my list.  Its always fresh and it is a treat compared to other food choices.  I'd never really had Hawaiian food before and didn't quite know what to expect the first time I went here.  But its really pretty much like comfort food.  And I love it.    But the real reason that I'm throwing 4 stars out is because today is the first day that I went there for lunch and the special is a screaming deal.  I got the Katsu Chicken and the portion was huge for $5.49.  My only regret is that I haven't tried more on the menu because the few things that I stick with are always wonderful.

ALWAYS, always a wait at the pharmacy. No effort to accommodate customers. Seldom do they open the 2nd of 3 stations that they have back there.  I don't even know why they set 3 up???  They only use 1.    Getting eye contact is next to impossible. So is a sincere apology for the lack of customer service in place.  Its not due to shortage of staffing either.  There are usually plenty of people back there and despite a lineup of people, they always seem to prioritize the driveup.  Its frustrating, because you know that whomever just pulled up isnt waiting yet if you are in the makeshift waiting area they take precedence.    I need to figure out where to go.  There is no shortage of pharmacies to choose from.

Looks like I have a new favorite local hangout.  Great atmosphere, and for those of you that are looking to make new friends, this is the place.  I left 4 hours after having arrived feeling like family.  Everybody was raving about the food so I dove in and was sure glad that I did.  It was great.  I had the sliders which came exactly as I had requested (I am a little bit of a picky eater) and the sweet potato fries were awesome.  It was a football game night so drinks were cheap but wonderful.  I ordered a house special Jack and Coke and it was served generously in a large rocks glass and the ice was great.  I dont think it was machine cut!  It seemed like somebody took an ice pick to a chunk like the old days or something...how classy.    So just when I'm thinking how great this place is and how many new friends I've made and that the night cannot possibly get any better...a band comes on!  And a good classic rock band too!  I made it home by midnight, but I hear that they serve there wonderful food till 1.  Friday and Saturdays they have prime rib which looked wonderful and Fridays I guess it is "all you can eat" fish fry.    When the bill came my buddy looked over and said "Thats it?  We've been here all this time and that's all we owe?"  Now that's my kinda place!!!  See you soon guys!

I've gotta tell ya that this was (I think) the last in the list of pizza places that I needed to try in the area.  In many respects, I saved one of the best for last.  In fact, this is going to fill in beside Grimaldi's as my fave.  They are so different and so good.  The place is small and there isn't much of a bar but our server was attentive and sweet.  My friends ordered a 20 pie and they just bring out half of the pizza so that we have enough room and they keep the other half warm.  Great move.  I ordered one of their Rustica pizzas.  I was very surprised at the delivery.  It was like a HUGE triangular slice.  They call it personal size, but they are being generous.  Its big.  The waitress talked me into the "Spaghetti and Meatballs Rustica.  WOW!  They put noodles on the pizza itself!  It was awesome.  There was so much else to try.  Being a wine cafe I would guess that they have good vino but I don't care too much about that.  Based on the quality of the za I must think that everything is good.  Plus, they have wheat crust or gluten free!   The music was a little loud.  Nobody was really into the music.  It wasn't that kinda crowd but whatever.  It wasn't horrible and I can live with it for the service and the pizza.

What a gift to have around the corner!  I agree with one of the previous reviewers....from the outside it doesnt look like anything special.  But the inside is wonderfully appointed with tasteful furnishing and artwork.  Tranquil and peaceful.  The bar too is unassuming yet refined and classy.  The waitstaff is all wonderful.  You'll feel like you've been transported to another state of mind where customer service is once again important.  The guys are great!  Such professional courtesy.    The menu is great.  They have pictures for people so that they know what they are ordering, yet the staff is eager to offer suggestions.  Everything is a speciality.  They have 7 or 8 different types of specialty rices.  The lamb shank is incredible as are all the kabobs and the kebodah!    No matter what you order, they bring out the softest, fresh hot pita with butter and raw onions.  May sound like a strange combo, but you won't feel that way after trying it.    And no matter how awesome your meal is (and I promise you will be shocked at how great it tastes) I challenge you to find a way to finish it all.  The portions are wonderfully huge and your mouth will be watering the next day waiting for lunch to arrive so you can finish it.    Best of all...despite the fact that this feels like a "Saturday night special place", its affordable enough to enjoy any night of the week almost.  Especially because most of you will get two meals out of it!!!  I have learned to love The Persian Room also.  But PARS is so much classier...so much more romantic...so much more "approachable" for those of us not from the middle east.  And the food is better here too.    Gotta check this place out!!!!

I am a realtor and had a showing a few blocks from Oscars.  So afterwards I did a Yelp search and thought to myself, "Hey...this could be good."  It had low dollar signs and 4 and a half stars so I figured it had to be a winner.  I was wrong.  Now I'll be honest.  I probably didnt order the right thing....although the guy taking my order acted like what I was ordering was off the charts.  It wasnt close.  I wanted something that wasnt fried so my selections were limited and they were all really expensive for a fast food "Order at a counter" kinda place.  I had the trout.  It came with a strange macaroni salad which I wouldn't touch if my life depended on it, but I am strange that way.  No other options were offered and I walked out $14 poorer and hungrier than when I arrived.    I would guess that the combo platters would have been more satisfying or even just the straight up fried cod with fries.  But I wasnt looking to feel like a walking grease pit on my way home so I wanted to stick with something fairly healthy.    Once again...with the reviews the way that they were I figured I'd give this place a shot even when I saw the menu.  I mean it seemed like it had to be awesome.  But what I ordered really left me unsatisfied.    I figured I'd at least head over to the yogurt place at the other end of the strip mall for dessert.  Darned if it wasn't out of business!  I think it just "Wasn't my night..."  Oh well!  So like I said...the two reasons I went there were a "fail"  I thought it was gonna be inexpensive and awesome.  Instead it was pricey and "blah".    I guess a fast food fish place in the desert is sort of a novelty anyway.  But it sure isnt worth going to again.

Wow!  I had been planning on hitting Bryans up for quite awhile.  I'd heard great things and was always bummed out when I was in CC on a Sunday and "remembered" that they were closed.  But not today...my phone says it Saturday so I am all good.  Wonderful.  The brisket and pulled pork were awesome.  Yes....that's the way I roll.  Tried both and they were out of this world.  Both came with a side, and the fries were a huge order and tasted great.  They have warm BBQ sauce to use and the buns were buttery and fresh.  I cannot imagine a better tasting BBQ than this.  I just can't.    Its a small place.  Really a lunch place (to me) more than anything else.  Maybe a weeknight dinner but not a Saturday night kinda joint.    But once you go you'll be back.  I know I will.  YUM!!!

What a find!!!    We went there for lunch on a Saturday, and normally I don't really go "all out" in the middle of the day.  This really was no exception.  I tried to keep it light, but even the light side was out of this Frickin world!    First of all, the atmosphere is awesome.  It truly is.  It is like an ultra modern Palapa.  I must've spelled that wrong because I got a red squiggly line under it, but you know what I mean.  The vibe was very cool.  Sort of Zen and the porch was part of the bar area and vice-versa.  There was a good crowd and everybody seemed to be having fun.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and just as described it was "heaven on a bun".  My girlfriend ordered fish tacos that she raved about.  Sweet potato fries were killer.    We sat at a community table because it seemed like the happiest place to be.  Down the table some people ordered the scorpion drink which was like a mai tai with 10 straws.  It was huge and didnt seem overpriced...especially when I saw the happy hour menu.    There were a ton of things on the menu that Ive gotta try for dinner one night soon.  Everything seemed so yummy.  Service was really friendly too.    I am dying to do happy hour here.  The bar area seems awesome!!!  Gotta  check this place out!

Beware.    This is how I perceived my experience with Hot Spring Spa Service located in Mesa (Not to be confused with Hot SPRINGS Spa).  These are my opinions, and may or may not be representative of other peoples experiences or facts relative to Hot Spring Spa:  I wanted to get a quote to get my spa fixed so I called these guys.  Sadly, they had been recommended by the guy that did the electrical for my spa, and he was great.    I called and had a nice conversation with Linda and she seems sincerely concerned about my issues.  I described my problem, and it seemed that she was listening with interest.   At the end of our conversation I was told that in order for a "technician" to come out, she needs for me to fill out a couple of pages of information (like I am going to a new doctor for the first time).    SInce this puzzled me, I told her that printing and faxing was not an easy task.  I explained that I didnt have a fax currently set up at home and that  I hoped that this "formality" could be avoided since no other contractor that I know of has required me to fill out this sort of information for a quote.  Nevertheless, she insisted that she could not send anybody out unless I did so.  It was "company policy" and since I wanted the entire process to be smooth and easy, I agreed to figure out how to arrange this.  So I fill it out....  They wanted authorization to enter my yard.  Do I have a dog?  Stuff like this...but the purpose for the forms I came to believe afterwards is simply in order to get your credit card number for them to assess $119 for them to come out.  And like the trusting person that I am, I filled out the forms and send them to Linda so I can get my spa fixed.   The only time available is 9 days away, so I wait.  The day before I asked Linda to please give me a window if she can of when he'll be there so I can be around.   She says she'll get back to me.  So the next day she did call me and she gives me a 4 hour window.  I tell her that I will be there waiting.  She acknowledges this and says she will inform the "technician" and we hang up.  Paul shows up and just marches into my yard un-announced.  My music is on in my open windows, open patio as well as the back yard.  When I saw him I was surprised since he was supposed to ring the doorbell.   So I run out to my backyard he say's "Oh...I didn't know anyone was home."    My presumption (with hindsight) is that it's easier when you don't have to actually talk to a consumer.  But of course I could be reading that wrong. :-)  So we look at the spa and I tell him what its doing.  And at this point I still have faith that he'll do something "techy" or mechanical and either fix it or take it apart to see if there is a short or something.  Silly me.    Paul shrugs his shoulders and says "Yeah...it looks like you need a whole new control panel."  I ask if its expensive and he says "Yes, about $510" BUT he will have Linda look up the part and call me to confirm the cost.  This is a "walk and talk", as he is on his way out of my yard having spent no more than 5 minutes at my home.  So I am upset that it's going to cost this much, and sure enough Linda and Paul had their story straight so she called to confirm that price.  Still...before I'm gonna bite the bullet on this I do a simple 30 second google search and see I can buy one  NEW for considerably less than what they said the part cost.   Now that I am set up for faxing since our previous conversation, I print and fax to Linda the printout for the part and ask if I can simply order it?  Understanding that this may not allow me a warranty for the work they'll be doing I also state that if it needs to be ordered by them, that's fine, but at least show me the invoice so that I know that they are charging the price for the part that they are quoting me.  I explain that I do want to do this with them, but I need to know that the part cost what they told me that it does, as they are still charging me labor etc...  Please realize.  This is ONLY the part cost that I wish to verify.  LABOR IS CERTAINLY EXTRA, and paid for handsomely.  Rather than addressing it professionally, they "CUT ME OFF".  That's right.  They "BREAK UP WITH ME" because I wanted to get some clarification of the facts they'd stated,  taking my $119 that I paid them for giving them the honor of being able to come out and quote my project.  $119 for nothing!!!  After an exchange of two emails, Paul called me PRIVATE (no caller ID) and acknowledged with raised voice that they "do make profit on the parts"  "Why should he have to furnish me with the cost?".  "When a client questions us about such things, then they have gone outside of our relationship and we are done with them", he says.  He then, hangs up on me with no provocation.    I did dispute the charge for only $99.  Giving them $20 for coming out to my home. I contacted another company.  They let me order the part myself.  They fixed my spa and it runs just f

Worst Saturday night service I've had in ages. It's a shame, because I really like this place normally and the atmosphere is kinda cool if you are in a "sports mood".  The problem tonight seems that although there are employees literally everywhere, for some reason there is only one bartender.  I could throw my theories out there...that the bartenders that work here get upset if management puts more than one on a shift because it eats into tips but other than that, I really have no idea why somebody wouldnt pitch in OR that the bartender wouldnt step up and insist on a hand because we all sat there for 20 minutes with empty glasses in front of us while she ran back and forth and forth and back.    At one point I said to her "Wow!  You really seem overwhelmed back there...I can't believe that nobody else would be helping you back there".  I could not believe that she had no clue as to what I was implying.  She said sweetly "Oh...I dont mind...really I dont.  It makes the day go by quicker."  I said tongue in cheek that maybe you dont mind but I have a hunch that your customers do.  She just smiled.    The owner was milling around too witnessing it all and doing less than nothing about it.  It was obvious.  The whole bar felt it.  I finally left without ordering another drink or a bite to eat as did my buddy.  I've gotta believe that this equation equals less money in tips at the end of the day than if two or three good bartenders ran it like a machine.  She sure didnt get much from me.  Sorry dear!  You're sweet...but you really shouldnt be hogging that tip jar at the expense of your patrons.  I'll try ya again.  Lets see if things adjust as the season approaches.

OK...  Well I will boost ya back up a couple of notches as I just received a call from my pal telling me "That all is good over at All American."  Apparently the owner was on top of my previous Yelp review and vowed that there will be two bartenders taking care of patrons from here on out on Saturday nights.  Like I said before, I'll be back.  I have always liked your place.  The view of the fountain, the TV's for sports buffs.  The friendly staff (especially Lauren) who knows more about rock and roll than most anybody I know...so I really would've missed you guys!    Glad that you jumped on it.  That's the way professionals do it.  See ya soon.

Hands down the best pulled pork I've ever had.  What a find to stumble onto. Just mouthwatering and fresh. The bun was perfect before they toasted it but toasting it just made it better. Lightly sauced, but plenty of sauce dispensers if you want more. I thought I would, but I didn't. Didn't feel the need to mess with perfection.    No atmosphere really, but we sat outside and it was really nice. The girl taking our order at the counter, which is how they do it like fast food, still came out with our food and even checked on us. She was awesome too. Pleasant experience on all fronts and worth going out of my way the next time to or from Sedona.

Update since writing.  I've gotta downgrade to one star.  I had an itch to start calling around to see if the practice described below was common in the industry.  It was not.  I called 3 other places (that didn't have the Scottsdale address) and pricing ranged from $125-$175 with a 3 year warranty.  There was no talk of needing to remove stationary doors or anything else.  They explained what they did properly without deception.   I am open to talking to the owner if he cares to discuss this matter further with me.  Their practices are deceptive no matter how you slice it.  Their competitors are not.  From here below is my original review:  These guys are around the corner from me so I figured I'd keep it local if I could.  Kinda wish I'd shopped it around instead.  Woulda, shoulda, coulda...  I called and spoke to a gentleman hoping to get somebody to come out and look at my patio slider.  It was sticking quite a bit and had gotten so bad that it was a struggle to open or close.  Instead of them simply having somebody come out to diagnose it, the representative seemed to have it all figured out.  He explained that they need to take the stationary door out first and then take the slider out.  After that they need to inspect the rollers and the track before replacing whatever was broken.  He made sure that I knew that "this is normally a two man job to take these 8 foot doors out,  but that Nick was well versed and strong and could do it alone."    I think you'll agree that this sounds like a pretty serious project.  And I was impressed that this guy knew all of the nuances required in order to get this slider moving freely again.  And to need to physically take out 2-8 foot high doors is a heck of a lot of work.  Certainly more than my usual handyman could take on...so despite my frustration at the cost ($275), I agreed.  I really had no idea that it would be so involved and even dangerous!  So the next day Nick rolls out at 8am (Nick was a great guy BTW) and we hit it off right away.  He comes in, and I run out for 5 minutes to get a cup of coffee at Circle K and by the time I get back he's pretty much done.  No doors needed to come out.  No 2 man job.  The whole pitch was seemingly just a way for the consumer to not feel so badly about this exorbitant cost for a 10-15 minute job.    Nick unscrewed the frame at the bottom of the sliding door and was able to then maneuver the rollers to come out under that side and put new ones in.  He did use the big suction cups that you see glass people use in order to assist in this.  But other than that, he and I talked a bit but he was gone by 8:15.  Unlike most consumers, I did call the office and spoke to the receptionist Tiffany.  She assured me that Pat would get back to me which he did not.  When I called the following Monday I had to refresh her memory about everything pertaining to my issue and she finally connected me to somebody else who dropped my price to $225...so $50 reduction for a 15 minute job.  Its obvious that they realize that if they charged an $85 trip charge which comes off of the first half hour of labor (the way that most repair companies do out here), that they'd never collect that kind of dough.    My gripe is this.  If you'd said that it costs $275 for us to fix your door regardless of whats wrong and a guy agrees, so be it.  But most consumers don't just bend over without knowing what they are bending over for.  That's why they were so proficient in outlining the extensive effort that goes into fixing my problem....truth is that the guy doesn't really know.  They don't want somebody to come out to diagnose it.  Heck...it could've been a rock stuck in the track.    They describe a fictional strategy for how they NEED to repair your issue and gain agreement based on this grandiose story on the phone.  Once the consumer is overwhelmed with what "the expert" tells them is required, they gain agreement on the price.  Only problem is that the work involved that they described was a big lie.  What if my agreement to pay you was also a lie?  Wouldn't that then be a wash?  Deceptive practices are why I am slamming these guys.  There are a million ways that you can do what you do without compromising your integrity.  And lets face it, diagnosing over the phone isn't the answer.  Maybe you thought that it would require all of the stuff you said?  I really don't know.  But if you were wrong, don't ramrod the consumer when it was really a simple fix.   I'm a Realtor.  I'd give you referrals rather than a blasting.  Honesty and integrity go a long way out here.  I've built my business model on it.

I went to Wolfleys tonight for a change of pace.  I had been there once before for drinks on a Saturday night and recall having one before leaving as there wasnt anything close to a "special" or even a tavern priced beer that night.  But tonight was a Tuesday and I wasnt looking to drink.  I recalled the bartender raving about the grub that night a few months back so I figured I'd give it a shot.  We got seated outside and soon regretted it.  Surely we could have been re-seated, but it wasnt that big of a deal.  The tables seemed somehow lower than they should have been in relation to the bar nearby and there were a ton of kids playing bags nearby.  Oh well...not the end of the world.  I seem to recall that I was a kid once too...so I am cool with that most of the time.  Waitress came.  She was OK.  Nothing too personable, but good enough I suppose.  I was trying to lay low on the carbs, so I asked her which she might suggest.  I was torn between some sort of a flat iron steak (which is more than I normally do on a weeknight) or the highlighted specialty beef sandwich.  She told me that the beef was on some sort of a salty pretzel roll.  She almost made it seem like that was the drawback but that the beef was awesome.  I said "That bun sounds great...I'll just stick with the bottom half" as a joke.  Once again, she knew I was laying low on the carbs because I told her in order to solicit her input.    Well this thing comes out open faced.  The bun was something.  It was probably far too salty for the average Joe but you could always brush some of the sea salt off.  But when I tell you that the amount meat on this open faced presentation was less than you would find on a $1.29 Arbys junior, I am not kidding.  Half of the bottom bun was even showing.  I could tell that when she set it down it was probably the first time she'd seen our order because she sort of looked like she was a little ashamed.  But obviously not ashamed enough to take it back to the kitchen and say to the boys "WTF!  Are you trying to get me shut out of a tip here?"    Truth is it had been a really long day and I didnt need to have the monster specialty sandwich that they seemed to describe in the menu, so I just let it slide.  It took about two minutes to polish it off so its no wonder that it seemed like forever for her to come back and realize that we were ready for the check.    Not the end of the world.  I'll live.  There is so much good dining here in town that its almost a shame that there is no time to give a place a second chance.  But I suppose that thats all the more reason that they should get it right each and every time.  They knew that this was a BS presentation of the sandwich that they were touting as their specialty.    My date said as we left "Now we know why they call it Wolfleys..."  I asked why?  She said "Because you leave hungry like the Wolfley..."  I didnt even know she was around when Duran Duran was around!  Good one though.  Steer clear.of this place.  I wouldnt even go back on a fool moon....Ooops!  I meant full moon.

Nice Chicago guy (Tony) owns the place and seems to run it right.  Drink and food specials are wonderful and now that Tony got the proper ovens, the deep dish is very, very good.  As close to Chicago style as I've found since I got here.    I'm a fan...the games are great if you are into video stuff and the staff seems real friendly.

What a shame...  Like so many of my failed relationships I fell for something that looked attractive, only to find out that beauty is sadly often only skin deep.  Such was my relationship with Venues today.  It looked great.  The location is cool, right near the sundial and the stone work and rustic/contemporary feel really pulled me in.  We grabbed a table outside and the waitress handed us some menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  She brought an iced tea and then we watched.  We watched the staff walk around seemingly in a New Years Day daze.  After about 15 minutes I told my friend to put down her menu, thinking that her still holding the menu was preventing the waitress from thinking we were ready.  Five minutes later I finally succeeded at getting that precious eye contact and she took our order.  Then...once again...we waited.  Now another fifteen or even twenty minutes passed and this time when I gained that eye contact I must have triggered her memory that we still hadnt been served so she went and checked.  Nothing.  Another five and she says "I'm going to see whats going on!"  She came back and acknowledged that she forgot to put our order in and offered to buy me a beer.  It was too early so I declined, but no other compensation whatsoever was made for this screw up.  She then came back again and told us that it shouldnt be much longer...there was only one order ahead of us.  How could anybody be ahead of us?  Wouldnt the kitchen drop everything to take care of the salad (thats right...thats all we ordered).  Nope.  Another five.  "Its almost done...there are just finishing the chicken."  We stopped her and said "Thats OK now...just bring the lettuce...we dont need the chicken".  "OK...are you sure?"  "Yes!!!" we told her"  We expected her right back now...no such luck.  Another five and she finally came back with the salad with the chicken.    Now she didnt try to bluff us and took fault for the error.  I'll give her that but the check came without any favors.  Didnt offer dessert.  I wasnt drinking and hadnt even hinted that I do so it was surprising that the only offer she made was for a beer?    She joked and even tongue in cheek made fun of the situation and it did add some levity.  She acknowledged "The shitty service" (her words) which I did laugh at.  But who would go back when they didnt even say "Hey....its on us...just please give us a second chance".    I dont think I will ever go back.  Maybe for a drink but I really felt bad for everybody waiting on their meal.  I think that one table left without waiting for their food while we were there.  Great atmosphere and unlimited potential I might guess but as for right now the "New Ownership" sign isnt winning over any patrons.  It couldnt have been any worse before.  Good luck.  Its a tough business!

Invariably the conversation of "good pizza" comes up when you are speaking to new friends in this wonderful city.  I can say without hesitation that I have yet to have anybody not agree with me that Grimaldi's is fantastic.  I have been to three of them and the atmosphere is good at all of them but the pizza is great.  The only reason that I can truly give as to why their pizza tastes so darned good is the ingredients.   It seems like everything is not only fresh as can be, but also the best possible quality.  From the cheese to the vegetables to the meats that they use...they all seem to be the best of the best.  If you have one choice for pizza, try this coal fired creation.  It is truly worth the trip.  As good as a New York styled gets unless you need the grease, and lets face it....that can be good too but this one lets you walk out feeling good about yourself.

Its tough to find a pool guy that you feel good about after he's done.  My experience has shown that there are plenty of companies that say one thing and do a lot different.  And it always seems to affect my wallet at the end of the day.  But no with Gerald.  My pool looks wonderful and his pricing was fantastic.  He is personable and professional.  And it seems as though his integrity is a rare find the pool business.  He credited me for something that I wouldn't have even known about.  Gerald is my pool guy from here on out.  He should be yours too.

I am half tempted to throw five stars out there because when I looked to Yelp today in hopes of determining whether or not to give this place a shot, it only had 2.5 stars.  It deserves far, far more.  I moved here from Chicago a few months back and knew that there were only a few things that I was going to miss.  Water and pizza were on the top of that list.  Now I can cross one of them off.  I have found that Scottsdale has no shortage of great, great pizza and Sclafanis is one of them.  I became a Grimaldis fan out of the box once I got here and didnt think that I could find a competitor but this place is right there.  The ingredients were quite fresh and the meatballs were wonderful.  The za was ready in 20 minutes and tasted just wonderful.  And it was priced right too.  We had heard from the bartender at Twisted Lizard that this was the pizza to try.  I think it might be his place too.  I am glad that I gave it a shot.  It is much closer to home than Grimaldis and it 's a quick answer to any pizza craving that hits.  Give it a shot when you want one at home.  It will hit the spot.

What a great place.   You don't even need to buy anything to feel good about being here.  Nice people and very interesting selection of local produce, beer, wine, etc...  Great music even!  Everytime I go here the music is wonderful.  Neat Dylan collage in the back too...I heard the story on it.  I think it was the owners album collection or something.   The best part of all however is the BBQ!  Wonderful selection of breakfast stuff and lunch/dinner.  You can buy the brisket, pulled pork etc...by the pound too which would be great to take home one night for dinner.  It is heavenly BBQ.  Really just great.    I feel like I am on vacation everytime I walk in this place and havent been disappointed yet.  Its so nice to see an independently owned gas station with an owner that takes every opportunity to share all of his passions with his patrons.  This is certainly not your ordinary gas station.  They have taken it to a whole new level and I admire anybody who "re-invents" something that we all thought that we knew everything there was to know about.  To call this a gas station is like calling Fashion Square a strip mall.  Its so much more and its worth the trip.

I'm shocked that this place has gotten such good reviews.  Its fun, I suppose to watch the food going around and around.  I've enjoyed places like this in Hawaii, but for me its the quality at the end of the day that makes or breaks it.    The quality was horrible.  And I'm not really a sushi snob.  But this was really pretty darned bad.  Every single item that I tried tasted exactly the same.  It was only the texture that changed with each new item, and lets face it...the texture on seared tuna isnt really all that appetizing.    Yes, it was cheap.  Yes, it could be fun and yes, the staff was very sweet.  But I can't go back...at least not in this town where there is good sushi at almost any corner.

Great GREAT food and wonderful atmosphere.  The bartender Jenna was awesome and fun to chat with.  We split the rare roast beef sandwich and some sort of a pot roast style entree.  Both were insane!  Of course we did the fries which were decadent as can be and split a caramel custard for dessert.  Everything exceeded our expectations.  We'd tried going here once before but it was too crowded.  We like to sit at the bar and you can catch them at a time when there isn't room but that's obviously the sign of a great place.  Wonderful open concept kitchen where you can see them cooking everything and the deck has heaters and a WONDERFUL fireplace.    Love this place.  You will too.

I should've known it was going to be a problem when I walked into the half empty restaurant on a Sunday morning and had to fight to gain eye contact with anybody that worked there to get seated.  But at that point, when you say "There are two of us", you are sorta committed to the place.  A few minutes later another person came and seated us.  This turned out to then be our waitress also.  It seems that maybe they each seat people as they desire in their sections?  Not sure.  But there were 4 people waiting tables and 11 tables with people.  So I cannot fathom how service could be so incredibly poor.    And when I say that the service was poor, please don't mis-interpret that the staff was rude or otherwise because they were not.  Everybody was fairly friendly and courteous etc...  But they just seemed to be running around aimlessly.   It became comical to a certain extent because we didn't really have anyplace else to be.  But all the tables of people seemed to be rolling eyes at one another at how long it could possibly be to get the check.  Or to order their food or even get a refill of iced tea.    There were tables that had still been left uncleaned from gosh knows how long before we arrived that were still that way after we left.  Our waitress was quick to explain that "They had been crazy" before we got there.  But for the entire hour or more that we were there all four servers were acting like they were in the midst of a "rush", but there was no crowd there.  They ran around and around once in awhile bringing food out with them or something.  I waited 15 minutes for the check after they'd taken my dates plate and left mine empty (so they knew we were done), but our waitress was somehow MIA.  I had to ask one of the other servers.  I give them two stars because it wasn't entirely unpleasant.  Once again, all nice people.  But if you've gotta be somewhere...anywhere else that day make sure you think twice before hitting this place up.    Also, the food really was very good.  Almost worth the rest.  As I said to my date "I do have to admit that this is probably the best French Toast I've had in ages", because it was.  But when you spend $13 for two pieces of Toast with no sides it damned well better be the best you've ever had.  And if you want to split anything they charge $3 for that.  Who really does this anymore?  My date ordered the salmon BLT and that was $17.  So the pricing is a little outta whack for breakfast too.  Anywhoo...food quite good but too expensive and the service just ridiculous.  Probably not heading back anytime soon.  Sorry guys.

I got introduced the JBAC&H like most people.  Because they were the service provider for my warranty company.  At first I was skeptical and didn't look forward to the process.  Initially, the circuit board went out for my air handler, and Joe came out to diagnose it.  He ordered the part and intended to return the following week to replace it.  Then, water started leaking into my guest bath and went up to take a look.  It was a mess.  The condensor coils had rusted out and the safety pan had rusted through.  YUCK.  When Joe came out he diagnosed what was wrong.  And it was a pretty big deal.  So his supervisor came out to diagnose the new problem in its entirety.    The supervisor did what a lot of other reviews claimed, but I'm not sure that he was wrong...he was probably right.  He said that the system is a sub-standard system...it never should have been installed in my home.  Even through the home is less than 20 years old, this system is out-dated etc...  He explained that the warranty company would only replace "Like to like" and that this could prove to be a problem.  With that I did some research and I let him know that I appreciated his advice but I only wanted to replace what was currently being used...basically, I didn't wish to be out of pocket any more than I already was (Warranty wasn't going to cover $350 of the repair).  He agreed...but I was still quite skeptical.  Finally yesterday Dan came out to replace the coils and told me that my washer/dryer needed to be moved for the install, and that he couldn't do it.  He explained that "His boss told him that I knew...".  Nobody ever said word 1 to me about it and I went into orbit.  Finally he agreed that if I held them harmless that he would move them which he did.  But it started the whole day off on a bad note.  Then...about half way through he tells me that the new condensor coil is too big to get in my access area and they will need to cut the walls/ceiling.  The drywall etc...won't be covered by my warranty again.  Once again, I am not happy but I can see what he's talking about.  So I finally concede and say "As long as you can verify for me that they don't make the size that I had, I guess that I am fine with it.".  Plus...I know that the last thing that they wanted to do was cut holes etc...  Low and behold, Dan and Joe find the same sized condensor coil that I had, get it up there, install it and don't make a mess.  They solved the problem and were at my house from 8:30 am til 6pm making sure that it was done right.  Now I've gotta believe that what the supervisor told me is probably correct.  I am sure that with many HVAC units a pro walks in and spots faults in the design from the previous person or the builder.  I'd guess its like a painter looking at another painters work and seeing where the lines weren't quite right and there's too much texture from the brush.  And if they were a perfectionist they'd probably suggest that the home be repainted.  But money is an issue, and modifying the HVAC isn't something I care to do even if it would mean saving $20 a month on electric.  But he got that, and he just did the replacement.  And Dan and Joe solved the problems as they arose.    All and all, I'm saying that they are damn good.  And I looked at Yelp after our first meeting.  These guys could use a decent review.  They are a 4 star place and in my book thats quite good.

I'd been putting off going to Bogeys for awhile.  As we all know, it had some turnover.  It had been Redondo's and then NY 51 or something.  So when it switched again I didn't think much of it.  It had been off my radar for awhile anyways and despite the fact that it was around the corner from my home, I didn't much care that another "Pizza place" was resurrecting the previous places mediocre food.  Finally I gave it shot.  And I am so glad that I did.    The service is great and you will feel like you're at Cheers if that's what you want.  If not, thats fine too.  There are plenty of places to sit down and watch a game or listen to good music on their huge selection Juke Box.  There are a couple of minor "themes" running through the place.  Naturally Bogeys paints a golf image and they seem to be pushing a little bit of the Irish Pub thing too along with plenty of TV's for sports, but the real draw is the good people there and the wonderful beer and food.  I had possibly one of the best burgers in the Valley last night.  The menu is extensive.  The BBQ Pork sandwich was also out of this world and the fries are the best around.  They have garlic, rosemary, waffle and one or two other great alternatives.  And I have been putting off the Killer Steak Sandwich which I have heard from a few is the Shiznit.  So if you are looking for a local place with regular people and great food, give Bogeys a shot.  You'll be back, I am sure.  Its sort of hidden behind the Jiffy Lube in the strip mall...so don't go judging a book by its cover.  The beer selection and food blows away all the other local bars in the hood.

I hate to do this to you guys, as the grub is pretty darned good.  But I've got a few issues that I think need to be shared.  I've been to both Bottleggers, and on all occasions walked out feeling somewhat depleted despite having a full belly.  And the last time made me feel that Yelp was a good vehicle to let you know why.  I took two friends for dinner at Bootleggers the other night.  We walked into the fairly empty restaurant (it was a Tuesday) only to wait in excess of 7 minutes for anybody to seat us.  First the waitress looked the other way, then finally needed to address it with a "sorry...we'll be right with you".  Then a manager type walked by and said the same.  Finally that same waitress sat us at a table out in the open without offering other options.  It was fine, and the music was too loud but we took it without issue.  Then we perused the menu to find that they have seemingly eliminated any moderately priced options.  There is no "Pulled Pork Sandwich" or "Brisket Sandwich" and even the renowned burgers seemed to be absent.  It seems to be all platters now starting at $16 but most are $18.  They come with either a bun or tortilla's, although when we ordered them our waitress didn't ask so we just got tortillas.  We had to then request buns.    So we get our $60 worth of food and there is no additional BBQ sauce.  It takes 10 minutes to get eye contact with anyone despite many of them walking by the table.  I assure you that we're not shy.  Its just that they are very good at avoiding it.  Finally, the three of us ask for some more sauce and it comes out in basically a shot glass...for 3 people.  Now another few minutes while she gets us more.    Once again, the food was great.  It was obvious that they were disorganized, but once again it was a Tuesday night and there were plenty of staff.  They just seemed to be on drugs or something.    I hope they can get things together.  Once again, the music is a little loud for a dinner place (and take it from me...I am a rocker...I don't normally say that) but it was tough to carry on conversation.  Food is good.  Very good...but its obvious that they are doing everything that they can to maximize their average ticket.  The shame is, that yes...they did get us that one time.  But I don't think I'm coming back anytime soon.  Its not longer a place to get a good pulled pork sandwich.  Its a place that you've gotta drop a lot of coin for BBQ.  I'll do the atmosphere across the street  at Bandera or even the Mission if I want that.

I was so excited to give this place 5 stars but couldn't begin to pull the trigger.  The food is worthy of it, but the service and atmosphere insists that I kick it down a notch.  Sorry!  The pizza was fantastic.  I ordered The Boss and it was huge.  Crust was wonderful and ingredients were abundant and fresh.  It tasted great and the texture was awesome.  Really just a wonderful Za.  We also ordered the pear salad which was fantastic.  We saw other orders coming out and they all looked equally as special.  The slices available for a quick grab and go looked great too.    But the acoustics were horrible.  I couldn't carry on a conversation once a few people got there after their movie got out.  I couldn't even understand the waitress when she was explaining something about the gelato.  She was new, so I don't wanna rattle the cage too much but after our pizza came she was overly occupied with small talk with other tables it seemed.  The place is small, so there can't be more than 20 tables but she seemed a little overwhelmed.  Plus, the tables are way too close.  Another couple came in and sat down next to us and I felt as though I was obligated to have a conversation with them.  That's too close.    Lastly, that darned Western exposure is a killer at dusk and between having the sun glaring in our faces, the couple almost on top of us and the fact that we couldn't hear ourselves over the rest of the noise in the place really undid so much of the quality that we would've enjoyed otherwise.  But if you want a great pizza, I'd have to say that this is on the top of the list.  I hope that they can cozy it up a little bit and put some padding on the ceiling or something.  If I was in a comfy booth facing away from the sun I think that it would have been there.  Right now I am just happy that I've got 3 slices left over for the week!!!

Quite possibly the biggest rip off in town.  Small patties not even cooked to order since they're so thin. Nothing buns. Big, big prices. To make matters worse it's louder than loud. Probably all the 4-6 year olds coming from the children's pottery store next door.   Nice waitresses though. But man are these price tags a joke. Plus, fries or onion rings are $5-7 extra.  Why?  I guess it's because they can.   But not to me. At least not again.
