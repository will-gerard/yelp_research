We ordered the mixed seafood platter but found that it had been "too" deep fried and therefore too heavy for us. We should have ordered something like a grilled fish. Friends of ours rave about this restaurant so we'll have to try it again and next time be more selective about what we order.

Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.

Food is good, great location, relaxed and comfortable. The potatoes were the best I've had in a long time.
