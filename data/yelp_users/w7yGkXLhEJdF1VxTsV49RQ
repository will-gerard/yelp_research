I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the horrible service I had on Saturday.    My bf and I decided to have a date day filled with sushi and a movie.  We arrived at Moto and were seated promptly at a table by the bar.  The restaurant wasn't packed at all and we seemed to arrive at just the right time.  Our server, Lilia didn't great us for nearly 5 minutes then she took almost 10 minutes to bring us our iced teas.  She took our order of the all you can eat sushi and it wasn't too long before our sushi came out.  She never once came back in the middle of our meal to see how the sushi was and showed up as I was consuming my last piece of sushi.  Normally, the servers will come back a few minutes after dropping off the first round of sushi and from there they will take your next order to make sure you get prompt service.  Just as I was eating my last piece of sushi she showed up and took our second order.  Our ice teas were low and she never offered to refill them.  We were watching the time and noticed our movie was starting within 40 minutes so we were a little concerned.  After sitting there for 20 minutes after putting in our second order, we asked the bartender if we had an order waiting for us.  He informed us she put it in but it wasn't up yet.  Lilia was literally wondering around aimlessly and didn't look that busy so we were a little upset that she was giving us horrible service.  She finally decided to come over and give us an ETA of when our last order would be up and we asked for our bill so we could pay and leave after we ate.  We let her know we still wanted our last order but we were just trying to make a movie.  She grabbed us our bill then came back and took our plates and cleaned off the table.  We were absolutely confused and asked the bartender about our order.  He told us that she cancelled our last sushi order and we informed the bartender that we didn't tell her to do that.  At this point we were fuming mad and just ready to leave because I knew if I had spoken to the manager I would've blown up.  On top of that we missed our movie and just decided to go home.  We spent $49.70 on sushi and that included a 20% gratuity tip that they automatically put on for the all you can eat sushi.  She honestly wasn't worth the $8.28 tip that I was forced to pay.  I seriously feel like I've been ripped off and the server received a 20% tip for pretty much doing nothing.  I come here all the time and I've never had bad service like this before.  The girls are normally attentive and want to turn their tables so they make more money, which makes sense.  This was the second time Lilia was our server and both times we had horrible service.  The first time we let slide because it was a Friday night and they were doing their local brews so they were slammed.  I just thought she was overwhelmed the first time and I didn't let it bother me.  But to have poor service from the same girl twice in a row is unacceptable.    Overall, the food was excellent, the bartender was more attentive to us than our server, I just wish I could've enjoyed more.

This place only gets one star for our server who was the only redeeming factor of this establishment.  The bad attitude started via phone from who I am going to assume is the manager.  A coworker of mine made a phone call to give a heads up that a possible group of 30 people were coming in at 4:30 for happy hour and she just wanted to make sure this was alright.  The manager (tall, skinny blonde chick) said to her on the phone in an annoyed voice that Thursday's are their busiest happy hours and they start filling up at 3:30.  She went on to state that we should've called the events coordinator because they handle large groups.  We weren't aware we had to call an events coordinator just for a happy hour get together.  Furthermore, I'm pretty sure a large group of people have randomly shown up for drinks without calling the events coordinator and I'm sure all was fine in The Vig world with no hiccups or bumps.  Two people from our group showed up a little bit before 4:30 on a Thursday (01/21/2016) and  they were informed that they had a table set up for us on the patio that could accommodate our group.  Miss Sunshine (the manager) came over to sternly go over the check policy and made it very clear that they could not split checks because it would crash their server.  Umm ok, if splitting checks makes your server crash then it's time to upgrade to a new server.  On top of that the place was dead.  There was one table inside and two (not including our group) on the patio so I'm not sure where this 3:30 rush of people were but they certainly weren't at The Vig.      I showed up shortly after they did and decided to go to the bar to grab a beer along with a coworker.  Miss Sunshine was by the bar when she rudely stopped me to ask, "Are you with the big party on the patio?" I replied "yes" and she put on her best Mean Girl voice and said, "You have a server out there."  I let her know that I was just grabbing one drink and cashing out.  As my coworker was looking over the menu she (my coworker) asked if I planned on ordering food, I told her that I wasn't.  Miss Sunshine chimed in, "Umm, just so you know if you want to order food you need to order it from your server" which that statement was accompanied by an eye roll.  At this point I had had it with her attitude and decided to give a little bit back to her and reiterated to her that I wasn't ordering food, but thanks for the friendly reminder.  I paid for my drink and rejoined my group.  I was facing the bar from my seat on the patio and during my stay I watched the manager check on every single table on the patio but ours.  Any time she was near our table she would roll her eyes and scoff but she was chummy with the other tables.  Her body language, her tone, her facial expressions made it very clear that she was annoyed by us (not sure why) and that she looked down on us.  It wasn't just me who got that impression because more than one person in our group picked up on it.  I think it's safe to say that a great deal of us have all worked in the food industry in one way or another, but I have never treated anyone the way she treated us.  When I was a server I never made any of my customers feel like they were a burden to me or that I thought less of them.  Because of her sparkling personality I will never return to this Vig but the others will have my business.  The other Vig's know how to treat their customers, they know how to make them feel welcomed and they never seemed bothered by a group of people wanting to spend money in their establishment.  This was my first and last time at this location, which is sad because it's so close to my work.  So thank you little Miss Sunshine for reminding me that kindness goes a long way.  Next time check your Mean Girl attitude at the door and slap on a smile even if you don't feel like it.  You know the old saying, "fake it til you make it!"

Where do I begin with how wonderful this place is?  Oh Urban Cookies, you are messing with my waistline and I like it!    By far the best cookies and cupcakes I have ever had in my life.  I literally have to fight myself from not going here on a weekly basis.  Their double chocolate sea salt cookies are too die for as well as their Chocolate X2 Cupcakes.    Everyone raves about Sprinkles but I won't give them the time of day.  They seem to be overpriced and on top of that they're not local.    The staff at Urban Cookies are so friendly and they make the tastiest cupcakes yet!

Great thin crust!  The boneless wings are delicious and you can tell they're not frozen.  The dough nugget are alright, I personally think they could use more garlic butter sauce, but they give you a lot of them.  Delivery took a little bit over an hour, but they redeemed themselves with their delicious pizza.  We can't wait to go there and try their deep dish pizza.  We will definitely be repeat customers, maybe not for delivery because it takes too long, but we'll definitely be back for more.

This is by far the best denitist I have ever been to.  Everyone in the office is super friendly, well educated and very helpful.  You can tell that everyone really gets along and they work well with each other.  After years of shopping around for quotes and advice on getting Lumineers, I finally decided to give it one more whirl with Dr. Cook.  I loved his honest approach as to what would work for me and what wouldn't.  I had had several dentists agree to only do the top 4 and promised me I wouldn't walk away unhappy.  When I talked this over with Dr. Cook he advised me that only doing 4 wouldn't satisfy me and I would most likely walk away hating my new smile.    I decided to go ahead and get the Lumineers after my consultation with Dr. Cook.  It was the best decision ever!  Words cannot describe how much I love my new teeth.  They look completely natural and they feel natural as well.  Dr. Cook really knows what he's doing and he wants to make sure his patients are satisified with his work.  Getting Lumineers was the best decision and investment I have ever made.  I will now refer everyone I know to Dr. Cook and I always praise his work for friends, family & coworkers.

This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I went there on Saturday with my boyfriend and two other friends of ours for lunch. We arrived around 12:30 and the place was already busy and had a 20-30 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink while we waited for our table. I couldn't believe their pitchers of beer were only $5 and they had my favorite, Hoegaarden.   When our table was ready the server came over promptly and grabbed us two more pitchers of beer. We started out with the bruschetta however we let the server choose what bruschetta we would be eating that day. If you know me then you know that I'm a snobby/picky eater but I was blown away with the Roasted Peppers and Goat Cheese bruschetta. I would have never tried goat cheese but I'm glad that I did. It was so creamy and flavorful. Also on the plate were: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. We gulped down the last of our pitcher, ordered around round and had another round of their delicious bruschetta. This time the server brought us: Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (I'm begging you to try this one), Salami with Pesto and Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. They were all so mouth watering that I highly recommend all of them.   At the end of our lunch the server brought over a complimentary desert for us, a salted caramel sundae: vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nut's, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. By far the best dessert I've ever had in my life.   Postino's left such an impression on my boyfriend and I that we ordered takeout the next evening. We both decided on the Turkey Panini with a side of salad and the organic chips. They make their own lemon honey dijon salad dressing which tastes great on everything.   I will definitely be a repeat customer at Postino's and I am demanding you to try it out this week/weekend. I promise you will not be disappointed.

I absolutely loooooooove this place!  I was hesistant to try a new nail salon since I had been so faithful to mine for over 10 years but I'm glad I did.  It truly does feel like a spa and the customer care is top notch.   After each pedicare & manicure they give you a complimentary 2-3 minute massage on your neck.  The nail techs are very friendly and helpful.  It may be a few dollars ($3 to be exact) more than your normal nail shop but it's worth it.

Some of the best food in town.  The Charley 2NA is too die for and so is their Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  I will definitely go back for some more deliciousness.

Such a cool, cozy place to hang out with friends and have some drinks.  They're food is rather tasty and the staff is super hip with a bit of a 'tude.    We ordered the Loaded Chips as an appetizer and I couldn't pry myself away from them.  They were too die for!  I ordered the Crab Cake BLT with a side of Mac n' Cheese and it did not disappoint.    Someone at the table had a side of Charlie Potatoes and they blew me away.  They are pretty much handmade au grautin cheesey potatoes and they are the tastiest things I have ever had in my life.

I was heading east on Thomas right by 16th street this morning when a Dent Wizard van started to get over in my lane (middle lane) without using a turn signal and almost hitting my car.  I honked my horn to alert them and they veered back over in their lane.  When they transitioned over into the middle lane now driving behind me, there was a lady in the passenger seat with long curly hair (brunette) wearing glasses who then flipped me off.  Once we passed the light at Thomas I headed towards N-51 and they were continuing to head east on Thomas.  The gentleman driving the van, heavy set, glasses and an Amish beard stared me down and was screaming at me through the rolled up window.  Probably not the smartest idea to do something like this when you're representing a company.  Very unprofessional! And now because of this incident I will view Dent Wizard as an unprofessional company.  If he and that woman treated me like this then who is to say they won't treat customer's like this.  First impressions are everything and you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

I've been to many mechanics over the years for various things and I cannot put into words how awesome C.A.R.S. is at professional service.  Tim definitely knows his stuff, and he will not mislead you or try to gouge your pocketbook.  He is very honest, efficient, trustworthy and reasonably priced.  I feel very fortunate to have found someone to work on my car that I know will treat it as if it were his own vehicle.  I will definitely return for future repairs.  Thanks, Tim!

Once again Tim doesn't disappoint.  I had a bit of an emergency with my vehicle and Tim was so kind and told me to bring it in.  He was very efficient, quick and affordable.  I love knowing that I have found someone who is trustworthy and honest to work on my car.  Thanks Tim!  I really, really appreciate the hardwork you do.

I come here for Kara Montoya and I find her to be absolutely fabulous.  I've been going to her since 2008/2009 and I just love her!  She's super quick with waxing and her facials are too die for.  Not only that, she's funny, witty, and adorable.  If you're in the market for a wax, facial, spray tan or lashes then Kara is your girl.

Definitely one of the best burritos that I have had in a long time.  We had the carne asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla and it was perfection!  I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu.

I used to like this bakery until last night.  I stopped here to pick up some treats for my fiancé and I, two cannoli's and two carrot cupcakes. The cannoli's were decent but my carrot cupcake was a different story.  The first bite was delicious but my second bite stabbed the roof of my mouth, literally.  I stopped in mid bite, spit it out and noticed that I had bitten into a toothpick.  I pulled the cupcake apart and there was the rest of the toothpick.  I understand this was a mistake but it could've been a very dangerous mistake.  After spending $15 on average treats and almost ingesting a toothpick I will never come back.

Hands down THE best wings that I've had.  They have the perfect crisp to them and the honey BBQ sauce is amazing.  I haven't had much luck finding decent wings but these are better than decent.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their delicious wing sauces.

I love everything about this place!  Lisa's barre class is where it's at.  She's funny, upbeat, and gives you a great workout.  She's quick to help you with your form and pushes you when you feel like you can't keep going.  I can honestly say that I've never done the same workout twice in Lisa's class.  Overall, everyone is great at CoreBalance and they are super friendly.  I'm so glad that I found this gym!

After catching wind that a new coffee shop was in my neighborhood I decided to give it a whirl.  I had a deep craving for a delicious pastry to start my week off with so I headed on over to Smooth Brew Coffee.  Everyone in my neighborhood has been raving about how delicious this place is so I figured I'd support a local business and satisfy my taste buds.  I pulled right around to the drive-thru and the parking lot was pretty empty.  I was glad to see this so I didn't have to fight the Monday crowd.  I asked the nice cashier at the window what pastries they had and he had me at cheese danish.  Score!  However, when he told me the price was $2.98 I about choked.  Then I figured that I would get a decent size danish for that price.  Boy, was I wrong.    From just looking at it I noticed that it was small and there wasn't enough filling in it, especially for the price I just paid.  I only took one bite out of it because it was really dry and it was stale tasting, even the filling.  The danish tasted like it was a day old and not freshly made, which does not make me happy considering I was really hoping to like this place.  My $2.98 cheese danish went into the trash after one bite because it was very dry and lacked flavor.      I really wanted to like this place because it's located near my home and pretty much everyone in my neighborhood likes this place, but after my overpriced dry danish I won't be going back.  I was going to give their coffee a whirl but I think I'll stick with my Dutch Bros. and I'll stick with Karl's Bakery for their pastries.   I understand this place is fairly new and they're probably still working out some kinks, so maybe one day I'll go back.  But as of now my taste buds are scarred and sad from the disappointing danish that I subjected them to this morning.

I absolutely love Orangetheory!  In the past I never enjoyed working out but OTF changed that for me.  At first I was intimidated and didn't know what I was getting myself into, but after the first workout I was hooked.  I love the idea of monitoring your heart rate because it holds me accountable. If you're looking for a challenge then sign up for a class. You won't regret it and you'll come back for more!
