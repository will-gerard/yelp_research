Less than impressed with the service I just received. After having serviced more than 6 cars here... Never have I had over a 1 1/2 hour time expressed. I understand being busy... But there wasn't anyone even there. The agent assisting me with my car could careless if I left. Didn't say sorry or anything- just said I could call and book an apt. Nahh-- I'll take all my cars somewhere else. ( not looking for special treatment, just looking to not be clearly rushed off ) see ya discount!

Jose B in the meat department is very knowledgeable. Cut up the chicken just as I requested- made some great recommendations on how to prep and even did a nice marinade on the side for me. It was more than I expected from a service stand point and I wanted to prop him out. Great service ! Thanks guys!

Absolutely positively one of the best dinning experience I have had in Vegas in ... forever. The food is AMAZING and its comes out so damn fast.   SUPER Big Props to the Manager Jason Pietrantoni- This guy is outstanding. Very friendly- has some great recommendations and is one of the reasons we will be coming back with a very large group.   Do NOT mess with or listen to the negatives comments on here-- they don't know what they are talking about. This place is a notch above the rest.

Are you staying at the Palazzo? Scratch that, are you staying in VEGAS ? Wait no--- Do you live in NEVADA ???  This place is a MUST. I've been 3 times now and cant wait to go back. Is it a little expensive? maybe, but  you're in Vegas... Listen this place has it all-- The staff is amazing. They go above and beyond here- you get what you pay for- they are fast with the food- the drinks are AWESOME. HUGE Props to the restaurant manager Jason. Very professional- checked in on us often and even made some recommendations that were jaw dropping. I understand that this is what a normal place should be like but coming from the industry myself- many places aren't. The music was upbeat- the bartenders were having a great time with their customers at the bar-- All in All, I love this place. I cant stay in Vegas and NOT come here. Ask for Ryan as your server- Tell Jason that I sent you :)   Thank you Jason and Ryan for the great time- another amazing Vegas trip with our friends and good memories to last as long as we can remember.

The customer service at this place is beyond ridiculous. I get it, you're busy. If you hate your job... Quit. There is no reason to be passive aggressive assholes. From one customer service person to another--- there is no room for this behavior in a location as great as this. I'm not ranting about just ONE person- it was all THREE of the bartenders tonight. I will never be coming back. I'm sure the 2 different ladies trying to order drinks next to used feel the same way.!

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This place is great. It's rare you find great food AND great service. Awesome dining area-- great location. Prices could be higher. I can't say enough good things. The owner pays attention to detail and it doesn't go unnoticed. Hopefully they can start delivering =]]

I've been here two times now. The staff are very nice. They had a huge back log on the tailoring and they were able to sneak me in. The buy 1 get 18 free is also nice.
