Been coming to Dalfalcos for years and it never disappoints! If you are looking for speedy service you are probably not going to get it because they are busy making their food with sweet love! My go-to item is the Cheesesteak (better than any cheesesteak you will get in Philly.) The Mac and Cheese is out of this world, seriously the best I've ever had. Their homemade pastas and pizzas are super legit too. Not to mention they have a great Italian grocery selection. I like to grab their pre made pizza crust and toppings for pizza night at home. Did I mention they have amazing deserts too? Only downfall is you are immediately going to need to renew your gym membership once you leave.

I love how they recently changed the food court pita jungle to a fast casual "chipotle style" concept. In fact I like it more than the regular Pita Jungle. So many options and at a great price. It makes eating healthy tasty and affordable. Highly recommend!

Was excited to check this place out based on the reviews...maybe I have a different idea of what good food is because this was some of the worst food I've ever had at a restaurant. It was pretty much inedible. I got the blueberry pancake stack with a side of sausage snd a latte. The "sausage" was a homemade patty of ground beef with raisins and other random crap in it. It's was cooked to the point of being pulverized. The pancakes on the other hand were undercooked and gummy tasting and that buttermilk syrup was disgusting. The latte was the only good thing I had there and the pastries in the case looked good. I hate ragging on mom and pop businesses but this was a total fail and waste of money. I will admit that I am not on the gluten free bandwagon but I do know there are plenty of ways to make it taste good, this was not one of them.

I would advise everyone not to check this place out...because you will most likely start making it a habit. Seriously some of the best doughnuts I've ever had! This spot has been a few different doughnut shops but this one is by far the best. Today when we were standing in line they even handed out free hot fresh glazed doughnuts. So good! They have a great selection and some fun flavors! Definitely a great addition to the scottsdale food scene!
