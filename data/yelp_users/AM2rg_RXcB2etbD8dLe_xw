This was my first visit to Liberty Market and  I was not disappointed. You order at a deli counter and as we moved through the line, we convinced each other to get a slice of their carrot and red velvet cakes since we were going to be yelping, we just had to try desert too! The display cases showcased all the delicious, pastries, cakes, and salads and I like the fact you can watch the cooks make all the sandwiches, flatbread pizza, etc right in front of you. The slices of cake were huge and with the extra calories. I had the egg salad sandwich and out was simple and delicious. My favorite part was the bread, so fresh and delicious. I've had so many chicken and egg salads that are over flavored, but this one was just right. So good and next time I'd love to try their breakfast and espresso.

I hold a place in my heart for restaurants like Marcello's.  The food is homemade Italian with some of the best sauces around.  In mentioning their sauces, I must bring up their fall-off-the-bone Pork Osso Bucco- Muah!  That and an appetizer of their stuffed eggplant and a glass of wine, I'm in heaven!   I've been going here for years and the service is as exceptional as the food.  You are always warmly greeted here by either the owner Tony or one of the other long-time employees. This straight from New York restaurant is awesome!  For those yelpers who did not have a great experience, it was a rare, one-time miss-hape, as I've been going here for years and have never had one bad experience!

Yum! I'd give it a five if they sold beer.

This place has a pattern for bad service, which is unfortunate since the food is excellent.  The cooks never make a mistake, however whoever staffs this place is way too conservative.  It's always packed, but the servers are running around crazy trying to services their 10 tables each.  If I have a craving for flatbread sandwiches, soups, and salads, I'm going to have to go with Kokopelis in downtown Chandler or one of the other dime-a-dozen artisan bistros/wine bars out there :(

Great little down town Phoenix lunch spot. There are a heap of creatively named sandwiches, breads, soups, cookies. You can choose any sammy and make it a half with a side. I ordered half of The Tame with a cup of their tortilla soup. It was all fresh and tasty. I took my lunch to go in a little brown bag, but they have a cute little outside dining area with, of course, lady bug table clothes. Adorable!

At this moment, I'm on a frozen yogurt kick and have tried a ton of these trendy shops. So far, Orange Leaf has been the best.  The flavors don't have that diet-yogurty after taste that some others do. I typically stick with the peanut butter and cookies and cream and they are yum! Plus the toppings are the best, including peanut butter cookie dough. Major plus.  I do love the Oatmeal flavor that Yogurtology and Zoyo have, so I'm hoping they bring it in.  Other than that, it's perfect!
