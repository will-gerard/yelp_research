What a great little place. Had the Pad Thai Noodles with chicken and medium heat for lunch. The little bowl of soup I had looked unassuming and was a fantastic blend of flavor. I usually just look and take a bite of egg rolls as they are usually just not my thing AGAIN these were great. and The noodles were perfect. best meal in a long time for such an out of the way little place. We will go back!

I love the camarones mojo de ajo! or .... garlic shrimp ;) the guacamole is fresh and plentiful as the free chips and salsa they do most of their dish justice and the happy hour is truly HAPPY!. kicking back with a few margaritas doesn't hurt either

The Abacus Inn was very clean and the customer service was excellent. On the other hand the food was terrible it tasted as if it came from the freezer or out of a package. I have had better chinese food from the grocery store. The tea had to be Lipton and lacked all the flavor normal tea has in Chinese restaurants.

I have always loved Manuel's but never reviewed it before. We have always had a great time with excellent margaritas. The food is good I have probably tried most everything on the menu and would recommend ... The Pollo Especial, the spinach enchiladas and the cheese crisps are great with chips and salsa when you just want to drink, chat and munch.

Cindy is awesome! She squeezed me right in for a full set and a spa pedicure. my hands and feet look and feel amazing. she was great at know exactly what I want my nails to look like and it is a week later now that I am looking and they still look wonderful.  This place is a local little find for me.

I ran over here in need of a birthday cake for my dad. I don't think I will ever look anywhere else and will always recommend this place. The people are as great as the cakes are delicious!

I was wanting to come here for awhile and we finally made it in! THe food and service was great. The place was busy but our service was fantastic and never really had to wait or want for anything. We dined upstairs with a view down that still felt intimate and fun. The salmon was excellent. Plan on going back very soon.

After much looking for authentic Italian Gelato in Arizona I must say That's Amore Gelato nailed it!!!  I have just gotten back from Bologna Italy and actually took a course in making Gelato and craving some good gelato away from Italy is a tough order to fill. I had the chocolate and the whiskey creme. IT was a little cold but the flavor was perfect. the texture was creamy and the presentation was beautiful.  Beyond all that..... I have to say the people working there made it fun to be there. they are as passionate about their gelato as I was about eating it! I will be back and bringing friends! (GREAT FIND)

We enjoy lunches here. The tilapia is good but the broccoli is usually under cooked. Today.... well, it's a holiday! so forget the healthy stuff :)  I had a fried cheese and bacon burger! OMG.... I should say it slowly... F R I E D CHEEEESEEE & BaCoN burger. I didn't want to do it but I was talking to the waitress who was VERY friendly and telling her my love of burgers, she recommended it to me and the sweet Tea which was peach and had a good healthy amount of vodka in it. DELISH.  The burger was better than I had hoped it was moist, dripping creamy fried cheese with nice thick sliced bacon and shoe string fries on the side with ranch dressing.   You no longer throw peanuts on the floor they have lil buckets at the tables for that and THAT makes me very happy. never was a fan of walking on peanuts... sounds like egg shells.   I have been here several times and it was over due for a review and this one needs to go on my love of burgers page. :)

I loved this tea house. it was warm and charming the menu and options were vast and the tea was delicious and graciously given. I ended up purchasing a few items from here as gifts and I do plan to come back again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. It was a true treat!

I went here on a recommendation from a friend. I am a HUGE fan. loved the hummus app. and the noodle shrimp dish was excellent. The staff ran like a well oiled machine moving, serving, smiling without missing a beat. the decor and staff attire gave a soothing and updated feel. Topped it off with the most excellent bannana pistachio nut muffin that I am going back for any time I am even in the area! GOOD IS GOOD!  I also tried the True Food Kitchen on Scottsdale road and loved it too but if I had to choose between the two of them I would make my way to this one first.

We eat here all the time. So far in Phoenix it has our favorite Turkey Burgers. I love the way everyone is in same color uniform, super clean and excellent food. Amazingly well-run restaurant. They also have muffins that make you wanna slap your mamma.

This place gets real busy at lunch time but the food and the staff are excellent! I am all about the chicken. soft corn chicken taco and chicken salad. they never go east on the guacamole either and I could kiss them for that. The avocados, chicken, salsa..... heck EVERYTHING is fresh, healthy and delicious!

This place was actually in it's last days when we came in to try a turkey burger, they are actually just becoming part of Our Gang Cafe. It really is just a small buger joint. Not memberable, not bad, just meh.   I actually asked for a salad with my burger. I guess that must have been a first cuz the guy asked if I just want some lettuce and tomato chopped up on the side, that made me smile! Served on paper plates and not a fork to be seen.  I might have gone back just because I like supporting small businesses and they was nothing too offensive about the food.   RIP, Burger Studio good effort sorry you are going.

I have ended up a regular here for lunch. Love the salads, the sandwiches and the Caesar Pizza is a guilty pleasure!! The tangerine/strawberry black ice tea is refreshing and they always give me a togo cup when I leave. :) (its the little things that count!)  Nice place to chill have a beer and some fresh food. I was surprised at the beer selection I really wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised!    I enjoy the staff and have always gotten good service.  and YUP.... I'll be back! ;)

Great little lunch place I love that southwest wrap and the fact they have sprouts. great place to eat and I definitely will be going back. Boars head meat is the best we bring it home all the time.

I saw so many great review on Zinburger we had to come and give the turkey burger a try. YUCK!!!!!!!!! I mean it was so disgusting we had grease running down our hands ( how do you get so much grease in a lean meat like turkey, what's the point!). then my husband had to catch a flight where he ended up belching the entire time with an upset stomach.  I know the review sounds harsh and I really hate to give such a low rating but honestly, it was the worst by far I have had for turkey burgers and a total disappointment. I thought it was also in poor taste to see some of the wait staff two tables away laughing and counting their tips and playing around. I wont be coming back. Just not worth the effort.

We came in for the reviews and almost left for lack of service. What a shame... I was excited to try something new. the waitress actually was just sitting up front wrapping silverware for a good 15 min before I finally hollered her over to take my order (never done that before, next time I will leave first) the only reason I bothered was because the reviews lead me to think it might be worth it. NOT!!!  only thing good was my beer 4 peaks solo, not really a compliment to this place but 4 peaks.   I ordered a burger med-well.... thing was cold and raw in the middle. the truffle fries were good but not enough to make me come back or recommend to anyone. A real shame.

After all the great reviews I thought this would be a fun place to take some friends for a night out. Over priced, not even average food. pretentious atmosphere and pretty cruddy service. HUGE disappointment which just leaves me wondering if people think just because a place is in Scottsdale it's good.   I honestly wanted to love it since I built the place up and was excited to try it out with my friends.    Good points.... the area, they have great location.

This is our all time favorite place for breakfast! The staff is excellent and runs like clockwork, never a need to ask for a refill.... They are on it. Great management and from the protein pancakes to omelets, burgers, salads and even chili. Good food and great place!

We come here ofter, I don't recommend the bison burger but I can highly recommend the turkey and the angus burgers. I get worried they won't last long since it never seems real busy but the veggies are fresh, the have a great balsamic as well as special sauces. All wonderful with a good beer. Cheers
