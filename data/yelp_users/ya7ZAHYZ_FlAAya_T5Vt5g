I used to work at Red Robin and, every once in a while, I get a craving for their burgers. I have been to this location a few times and it has always been fine but this is the first time I have returned since the branding has changed to try to reflect a more upscale atmosphere. The changes are, sadly, not good. I already groaned when they insisted on now calling their "chipotle mayo" "chipotle aoli." Clearly "aoil" costs more than "mayo" so that's a reason why the prices have gone up. In addition, the "garlic fries" that come with an upcharge used to have real garlic on them but now come with a simple seasoning. Additionally, our fries that came with the burger were cold, so we asked for fresh fries. When we received those, they were cold, as well. When we followed up they insisted thay they were taken out fresh. If that is he case, there is something seriously wrong with the equipment. We spoke with the manager but he did not seem to care and did not offer any real consolation and treated us as if we were just being difficult. Needless to say, when I need to get my Red Robin fix in the future, it will be elsewhere.

I saw Romeo's on "Check Please" with my parents and they wanted to give it a try. Based on the Yelp reviews and the massive menu I was a bit skeptical, but I am so glad that we took the plunge.   We went for lunch and we all split an appetizer, 2 pitas, and fries for the 3 of us. The appetizer, the Feta Dill Fritters (gyro meat, dill, and feta deep fried and served with a yogurt sauce) were sublime. They make their own gyro meat and it shows. The feta gyro pita (gyro, feta, and artichoke hearts) was similarly exceptional as was the pastrami cream pita (cream cheese, pastrami, avocado, and provolone). What shocked me, however, was how good the fries were. They were double fried steak fries that had the perfect balance between crispiness with a little potato flavor on the inside. Served with feta dressing and big enough to share, they were a surprising star. Finally, while we were too stuffed, there is a massive dessert case that tempted us to change our mind and try to fit it in, but we couldn't do it. I highly recommend sharing due to the large portion sizes so that you can have room.  Overall,  it was a great experience and we will definitely be back!

I had to get fingerprints done for an FBI background clearance. The process was efficient, the staff was excellent, and it was nice to not have to deal with ink. Overall, a good value for the procedure.

Checked it out during the soft open. They have 15 beers on tap (they will slowly be incorporating their own beers) and an impressive menu featuring southwest fare. I only dropped in for a drink, but I will be back to check out the SW poutine (fries, cheese, gravy, and machaca...what could go wrong?!?).

Went back after they opened to try their beer and food. The beer was solid, but nothing jumped out. It looks like they are trying different things and getting feedback so don't expect to always have the same options.  The food was phenominal. I had the green chili mac and cheese with machaca. It needed a little more kick for me but, after adding a little hot sauce, it was pure perfection. They make all of their food from scratch (except the bread and one other item, but they will be doing thay soon, as well) and it shows.
