I have gone here since I was a little girl. This place holds a lot of nostalgia for me! I love the setting, an old house filled with unique antiques. It makes for interesting conversation pieces. The food is good. I usually get the "Managers Special" which is pasta with your choice of 2 sauces. I always get half clam sauce and half mizithra cheese with brown butter. Yum! All of their dinners include fresh baked bread, salad or soup and a scoop of ice cream. The prices are great, but the service can be hit or miss. Great for large parties or kids! There's even a real trolley inside. The food is good, not great, but good. 4 stars for good food, great atmosphere and reasonable prices!

Oh how I love their green machaca burro! So good! I get it double wrapped because it's messy and their tortillas are so good. I've had other things here too and all have been very good, but my heart (and stomach) belong to the green machaca burro. The place is a dive, however. Do not come here for atmosphere! I order ahead and pick it up to eat somewhere else. They often get special orders wrong, so I've learned to check everything before I go. I overlook the atmosphere and inaccuracies because the food is just so darn good! Also you can buy tamales or tortillas by the dozen. Yummmmmm

We have gone to Dr. Laws for at least 13 years. We love it there! I know I can trust him to be honest and conservative in his approach. Laurie is an excellent dental hygenest, we've been seeing her for at least 13 years too! Everyone is very friendly. We have always received excellent care. I've referred many friends and family members here over the years and all of them have been happy too. I highly recommend!

I love ordering clothes online on clearance! Awesome prices. If they don't fit right or I don't like them I simply return them to my local Macy's. It's an easy and, admittedly a lazy, way to shop but I love it! I took one star away because I find their women's plus size clothing to be very hit or miss in terms of sizing and fit. However that's not a big deal for me since I have a Macy's near by. I have also purchased purses and shoes on clearance online at a great price!

I enjoy going here to explore. There's always neat kitchen gadgets, unique food and drink, neat bath soaps, lotions and salts, cool furniture, candles, decor, baskets, blankets, jewelry, nicknacks and so much more! Great store to find gifts and they have greeting cards, wrapping and baskets there to make your gift look really special. We have a tradition of shopping here for unique stocking stuffers and Easter baskets for our children. Some of the furniture and decor seems overpriced to me and their bathrooms are not so great so I took off a star. However they frequently have sales, so if you like something but it's pricey, sign up for their emails and wait for a coupon or sale. We bought a pair of sold wood end tables here years ago and they are still in our livingroom looking great so the quality is good.

Love getting food from here for lunch! I usually call ahead and they have my order ready for me. They are always friendly, they pack chips and salsa for me and the food is very tasty. Plus their prices can't be beat! I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and have always gotten great service. They are always really good about keeping drinks, chips and salsa filled. This is a great little restaurant!

Oh how I love Sacks! It's near my work and I come by frequently for lunch. Everything I've tried is fantastic! Favorites include the Remington, the pulled pork on a pretzel bun, Caesar salad with Cajun chicken and I can't leave without an overload cookie! Best place for sandwiches! Fresh bread. Delicious ingredients. Relatively fast. Always friendly.

I have adopted one dog and one cat from here. Also my mom adopted a dog from here too. This is a great place. They do a good job screening owners and take good care of their animals. They really seem to care.

Stopped here because my check engine light came on and I heard a radio commercial that they can do a quick diagnostic. I waited a very long time to get help. There was only one guy helping customers. Another employee walked through and apologized that he couldn't help because he had to take care of a delivery. We were told the manager was on the phone and couldn't help customers either. I was one of 3 people in there with the same "check engine" issue. I guess their ads are working, but they are ill prepared to handle the customers. I left irritated and grumpy.

My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here! It's a bit of an odd location but we found it ok. We started with vegetarian tostadas which were delicious. For my main entree I got the Chile relleno  which has seafood in it and is topped with a creamy lobster sauce. It was amazing. My husband and I agreed that mine was the better dinner of the two (he got the pernil asado). For a side dish I got the green chile cornbread casserole which is very tasty. I also got a small fuego salad which isn't small. It had a delicious dressing on it and was a very good salad. For a drink I got the pomegranate mojito which was ok. It had salt on the rim instead of sugar which I thought was odd. I also got a chocolate espresso drink which was very good. For dessert we got a banana burrito. It is a tortilla wrapped around a banana and chocolate and deep fried. It was served with chocolate malt ice cream, candied nuts and whipped creme. It was very delicious I highly recommend. The only downsides are that the atmosphere could use some improvement. We were outside and our table was dirty. Things appear kind of run down. Also the wait staff isn't dressed very professionally although we received good service. I think it's a little high priced considering those things, but the food is top notch!

We have come here many many times over the years. I love their food! Love the salsa bar. My favorite is the Pollo asado burrito. Yum! Always friendly and fast. I took one star away because I wish they had larger bowls for salsa since the little cups they offer are so small. It's hard to dip the chip in. I also wish they offered free refills on drinks.

This is a great place! The coffee is second to none. Today I got a no sugar added iced mocha. I love it when they shake iced coffee so the bottom half isn't still warm, yuck. Thankfully my iced coffee was icy cold throughout and delicious! We stayed for awhile assembling Easter baskets for our children at one of their tables and all the people working there were very nice.

I really love Ulta, especially this location.  Have always had good luck with helpful, curtious employees.  They are also great at returns.  I took back some eye shadow and eyeliner that I didn't like once I got it home.  One lady there helped me find the best foundation I've ever had and she found the exact correct shade to match my skin tone.  I rely on the employees recommendation a lot of the time and they have great input and are knowledgeable about the products.  Very happy!

Friendly staff. Convenient appointments. Great work. My daughter has been going here for about 15 months now. Her teeth are looking great. She is always greeted by a friendly staff member who takes great care of her. I love that making appointments is very convenient. Appointments are on time and usually quick. The office is comfortable for parents who are waiting. I did have a billing issue, but the Office Manager addressed it and was able to come to a fair resolution.

Love this place! We've come here for years. Love the sourdough bread, sometimes we buy a loaf to take home. My favorite is the Hells kitchen, I also love the pastrami on rye, the crab cakes are great...  So many great sandwiches. Always friendly service.

I usually choose this restaurant for my birthday dinner. Their food is absolutely delicious! Tonight they did not disappoint. We started with the crab and spinach dip. I had the Pasta New Orleans which is fettuccini noodles in a pink Cajun creme sauce with lump crab, grilled shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes. My husband had Mississippi Catfish Opelasoosas which was Cajun grilled catfish with lump crab, mussels and shrimp with a creme sauce and dirty rice. Their dirty rice is amazing! We both took left overs home and we are pretty big eaters. We both got a cocktail and my husband got a Caesar salad. The total was ~$106 before gratuity. The service was great. I loved the atmosphere, such a beautiful patio. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful but can be pretty loud. There is usually live music on the patio on the weekends too. Also they take reservations!

This is our favorite theater. We live in surprise and do not like Ultra Star, so we drive to this theater instead. It's usually not as busy as the Arrowhead location and parking is better. We love Harkins because we get the refill cups and a shirt which makes movie snacks much cheaper. We always bring our cups for $1.50 drinks and wear the t shirt for free popcorn (we upgrade it to a large for $1.50 which also comes with a free refill). $7.50 for movie snacks for 4 isn't bad at all! The theaters are clean and comfortable. Great theater!

I have been here many times over the years. In fact, we had our office Christmas party here one year. This is a great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner. The food is fantastic! I love the pasta rustico or the pasta valducci. Yum! Also I love the spring mix salad and the zeppoli for dessert. Their bread is freshly made and delicious. I took one star away because service can be inconsistent.

We used to come here a lot because we liked their subs however I just can't get past the meat slicer not being clean. I always get the cheese mix sub and I find it gross that they slice my cheese on the same slicer that they slice the meat on so I end up with scraps of mystery meat stuck to my cheese. Yuck. Plus the slicer just looks dirty. We have started going to Jimmy Johns instead.

Trader Joe's is awesome. Great produce, bread, beer, wine, cookies... all kinds of stuff! Also fresh flowers and the best chocolate. Great prices. Unique stuff. My favorite is the arrabiatta sauce. It's the only pasta sauce we will use! I just discovered the cookie butter cheesecake which is to die for. You can find it in the frozen section for ~$7 for a whole cheesecake (is small but we cut it into 8 pieces). I love that they have seasonal offerings like the variety of pumpkin spice things in the fall! I also go here every year for Christmas gifts, they have a unique selection of chocolates and other treats that are always popular... and won't break the bank.

This is a great location. We stop here on our way to the Anthem Outlet Mall. I like to get the grilled cheese which is a burger without the meat. Their fries are so good. If you like them crispier you can ask for them well done. This restaurant is always clean and the people are always friendly and helpful. Food comes out fast and fresh.

Chipotle what is up with your new radio advertisements? I love eating at chipotle. The food is always fresh and tasty but with the recent bad press you've gotten I don't understand why you would choose to run the radio advertisements I have been hearing lately. The advertisement I'm talking about is the one where the narrator explains chicken or beans to the listener as though we are stupid. This does not seem like a very smart marketing strategy. I do not appreciate being talked down to and I'm pretty sure other people feel the same way. I'm disappointed in this decision because I love eating at chipotle restaurants . I have been concerned because I have heard rumors that chipotle may be shutting down due to recent bad press . I don't think this new marketing campaign is going to help the situation . Your customers are intelligent we are not idiots and I do not appreciate the tone of your new commercials. Please get some better marketing and stay in business . I do not like to imagine a world where I cannot buy your chips and guacamole!

Inconsistent. The food is good IF you get what you ordered and they made it right, however you can't depend on it. I have had several breakfast burros where I bite into an eggshell piece. Yuck! Also they tend to not get my order quite right about half of the time or leaving off ingredients when I've asked them to or finding something in my food that I wasn't expecting. Usually the nachos are pretty safe. I would go here more if it was consistently good.

I took my little Chloe here today to get her teeth cleaned. The office is very nice and clean,  very professional. Loved the artwork on the walls! The Receptionist was friendly and helpful. Dr. Katz was friendly and obviously cares about her patients and their comfort. She informed me that she may have to pull a few loose teeth but would do so only if necessary. She said she would treat Chloe as if she were her own dog when making decisions. She assured me that Chloe would be comfortable and even carried her back in the blanket I brought for her to keep with her for comfort. I received a call from the doctor in the afternoon letting me know that Chloe did well and she did not need to remove any teeth. I was relieved to hear this (I had worried about my doggie all day). When I picked Chloe up, the receptionist was friendly and gave me information. She answered my questions. The price was very reasonable and the care we received was top notch! Chloe's teeth are pearly white and her breath is (thankfully) much improved! She can give kisses again without the recipient recoiling in disgust. I am very pleased and will surely be back! Thank you Dr. Katz and your staff for taking good care of my fur baby!

A new favorite! The food was amazing! I had the surf and turf shaken beef and shrimp. The beef was delicious. It came in a skillet like fajitas but in this amazing sauce with mushrooms and caramelized onions. It also came with a bowl of broth which was out of this world amazing. Super flavorful. It also had rice and a salad with it. The salad was delicious! I can't say enough about how delicious all of the food was. The service was a little lacking. BUT the food was so good I didn't care so much about the service.

We had a really good experience here. The food was very good. I loved the barbecue sauce so much that we took a bottle of it home. We told the person at the counter that this was or first time and she gave us some samples to try so we could decide what we wanted. We ordered the chopped barbecue and a whole sausage, corn, potato salad and beans. My husband and I shared.  Everything was delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the atmosphere, it's cafeteria style seating. I prefer a sit down restaurant, but no big deal. We met friends here and everyone enjoyed themselves.

I really like the coffee here but they are often too slow for me. If I'm not in a hurry I may come here. I would come more if the service was faster like at Dutch Bros. The people here are usually nice, but I think they need more people and maybe a drive through speaker so you can order before you get to the window. It would speed things up.

I just tried this place for the first time today after hearing my co-workers Rave about it. I have to say I agree. I got 3 tacos made with the flour and corn tortillas which are delicious. Fresh home made Tortillas are to-die-for! I had one with the corn bread stuffing filling which was recommended by a friend otherwise I may not have tried it. It was so delicious!  It is very tasty and a little spicy. I also tried the smashed potato filling which was more mild but still good. And the third taco was with the spinach and mushroom filling which was my least favorite. The spinach and mushroom was a little limp for my tastes. I topped them all with pico and guacamole and a mixture of their two cheeses. I had them top it all with the crema sauce and their gadzooks buttermilk sauce. So so good! I will definitely be back. A couple of suggestions for the owners though. The spinach and mushroom filling seems a little lacking and a little wilted. Also the largest soda available for purchase is only about 16 ounces which is not enough for us in Phoenix who are usually hot and thirsty and want a large ice cold beverage. Overall this place is great and very unique!

I had a great experience here! I felt more like I was at a spa than a medical office. I found the decor and atmosphere very relaxing. The employees were professional and tried to get me in and out quickly. I got 4 tests out of the way and kind of enjoyed my time there. The lights in the test rooms are dimmed which is nice, no bright white lights here. Definitely not the cold sterile feel of a lot of medical practices. I took one star off because I still think they could have been a little more organized as far as the order of my tests, but that's pretty minor. Also I called 3 times to get my appointment. The first two times I hung up because I was tired of waiting on hold. They need to improve this to make it easier to make an appointment.

I have been to this location before and have always been happy. I appreciate the relaxing atmosphere. However, I was surprised by a HIPAA violation I observed and I am concerned about my privacy if I were to return to a Simon Med because of it.   After a test, the technician left the room for about 5 minutes to consult with the doctor. During that time I noticed that the screen on the computer (right next to me in plain view) was displaying what appeared to be her schedule for the day which listed patient information including name, time of appointment and what they are being seen for. I can imagine that the patients before and after me probably saw the same information and I felt this was a violation of my privacy as well as the other patients on the list. I didn't say anything because it was a stressful event for me already.   The doctor who spoke with me about the results was obviously not interested in explaining them to me. I asked some questions but he just gave very simple answers which really didn't answer the question. It is scary to get some test results, but he didn't even explain it enough to where I could Google it. It was awkward that the technician stood there and stared at me while the doctor was talking with me about my results and the door to the room was wide open (I think the doctor intended to make a quick getaway). Another violation of privacy. I will be asking my primary care doctor to explain the results to me like I'm an adult instead of a child because I want to be involved in my healthcare and to understand.  I think they have some major privacy issues to resolve. I really feel that the employees at this location need to be taught to be sensitive to patient confidentiality.

We have gone here many many times. My kids love it and we love it too. The food is great, always great service, clean, fast and the custard is very good. My only complaint is I'm not a huge fan of the old fashioned music they play rather loudly. However, my son loves the music so I guess it's just me. Love it here!

We really wanted to like this place. My husband is an avid road cyclist and he currently has to drive 30 minutes to get his bike worked on. So we thought we would try the local shop since we live in surprise. The first time we went in was a couple of years ago and there were two people working in the store but we were the only customers. Not one of them said anything to us which was awkward so we left. We gave it another chance a few weeks ago and had them do a tune up and repair on my husband's bike. They didn't call when the bike was ready. When my husband got the bike back it had greasy hand prints all over it and on his handle bar tape which he had just replaced. This can't be cleaned off so he will have to replace it. Also the parts they used to repair the bike were not the quality he had asked for and the bike doesn't shift smoothly as a result. We will need to take it elsewhere and have it redone. Very disappointed.

I work nearby and this is a favorite place to get lunch! The people who work there are always friendly. The food is always amazing. I love their pizza! They are, of course wood fired, as the name suggests, so the crust is delicious. I've done pesto and red sauce as a base and then I load my pie up with all of my favorite toppings. Chicken, meatball, fresh mozzarella, artichokes, Sun dried tomatoes, peppers, kalamata olives, fresh garlic.... I could go on and on. Their salads are also wonderful! There is a choice of romaine, spring mix, iceberg and other lettuce which is nice, add your favorite toppings and they will toss the dressing on it for you if you want. The chipotle ranch is my favorite. I love the salads as much as the pizza! This place is great, only thing is that it gets VERY busy during lunch time. I always show up around 11 to avoid a long line. Problem solved!

LOVE IT HERE! This place is my fave. I used to be a Starbucks fan but not anymore. Dutch Bros has knocked them to second place. The people who work there are always friendly and eager to please. The coffee is great. I also love their tea. I love when they do special days like 9 stamp days. Makes me happy.

I just got a new bike today for Mother's Day and I am so excited! I started looking for a beach cruiser here and rode their Halo and Stomper beach cruisers. LOVE them both! Then my husband and I drove all over town so I could try a variety of beach cruisers to be sure I was getting what I wanted. We ended up back where we started because their bikes can't be beat! They are quality and comfort, plus it's very cute too. I decided on the Halo model 3 speed in pink and white. I also had them put colored lights on the wheels which look super cool at night. My husband fell in love with the fat tire Stomper bike. I have a feeling we will be returning for one of those... I have to say that the guy who helped us was very friendly and knowledgeable. Also we noticed that a lot of the customers were returning to buy more bikes for all of their family members. One guy was buying his family's 8th Soul beach cruiser! That's a good sign, happy customers coming back for more. I also noticed they had sold many bikes in the few hours we were gone looking at other bikes. Their prices are very reasonable and the bikes come with a great warranty. Great experience! Now I'm gonna get to cruisin' on my new bike...

We love it here! On our first visit in, we were so impressed with how friendly the staff is. They welcome you right off and make you feel at home. My husband and 2 kids are enjoying classes and my daughter just earned her next belt. Lots of families here. Parents taking classes with their children. We feel that the price is reasonable, it's very family oriented, very positive atmosphere and everyone is friendly and encouraging. Highly recommend!

My son is a blue belt and my daughter is a brown belt. I've noticed an increase in their self esteem and in their confidence. I feel good knowing my daughter is learning self defense as a teenager. I've noticed a more respectful attitude from my son. The instructor helps them set goals in their life and teaches them to be better people. Not to mention is a great workout! This is valuable family time too.

We really enjoyed the doughnuts here! My favorites were the apple pie doughnut and the salted caramel. My husband liked the bacon bomb. My son liked the death by chocolate. We didn't like the key lime doughnut. I got an iced coffee which was good. Service was a bit slow. I would have expected more than 2 people to be working on a Saturday morning. We will definitely go back. I hope the service is a bit quicker next time.

I really wanted to like this place. We are kind of tired of our normal pizza places around here. They were very friendly on the phone. I ordered a large white pizza and a large cheese pizza. It was done when they said it would be. We just weren't happy with the taste. The crust wasn't very flavorful and had a strange texture. Also the pizzas seemed very greasy. The sauce wasn't very flavorful. We just didn't like it. In fact we ended up throwing away about half of a pizza because no one wanted the left overs. Also I think their large is smaller than what we normally get somewhere else. I'm so sorry to write this because I want to encourage small business! They were nice. I have to be honest though, we weren't impressed.

We tried Daniel's for the first time today. I have to say I think we've discovered a new favorite Mexican food restaurant! Everything was very fresh. The chips are freshly made and delicious, love the salsa and the guacamole was awesome. I'm somewhat picky when it comes to guacamole. My daughter got the chicken burrito. She loved it. I tasted the chicken and it was well seasoned and very flavorful on its own. My son had two beef tacos which he said were the best tacos he's had. The shells are freshly made, not sure if they're grilled or fried but they were amazing. My husband and I had the carnitas burrito. The meat was very good and it was topped with more yummy guacamole. We had a little sticker shock when we paid, it was $60 for all 4 meals, chips and guac and 4 drinks. This seems a little pricy for the atmosphere since it isn't a sit down restaurant. However my daughter says they support her media club at school and of course the food was delicious so we will be back. One note: because the food is freshly prepared everyone's food comes out at slightly different times. We didn't find it an issue but some people might. All the people who worked there were very nice and helpful too!

This place is a well kept secret. You check in at the pharmacy counter. I only waited about 15 minutes. They have their own room with a comfortable chair to do the blood draw. My doctor recommended it because it is faster than Sonora Quest and their process are better if there is any test that isn't covered by insurance. The phlebotomist was very good, very professional and I had my results in 24 hours. I asked if I can bring in lab orders written on Sonora Quest forms and she said absolutely. I'm definitely going here for blood draws from now on. They are even open on Saturdays and Sundays.

Great food but overpriced. $16.99 for a sandwich, fries and coleslaw?? The dessert selection is phenomenal! Their Ruben sandwiches are amazing. Egg salad sandwich is very good. The Monte Cristo is very tasty. I suggest splitting a sandwich since the portions are huge. We are big eaters and were happy sharing. My kids both love it here. Would come here more if the prices were better.
