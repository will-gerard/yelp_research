Grabbing lunch with my wife.....bbq sauce everywhere! I love a good steak and although this is a chain style restaurant their steaks are consistent as is the rest of the meal! My favorite location is at Metro Center, although we do stop in at the Arrowhead location from time to time.

What can I say, this place is awesome! Live entertainment and adults enjoying themselves. My wife and I are in our late 30's so it's nice to go somewhere that's laid back and is filled with like minded people, so many times have we went out to dance and the DJ loses their mind and starts playing Tejano, hardcore rap or just starts to mix so much the song loses all meaning. The only negative I could point out is the size....but that's what makes this place feel like home! If you don't know someone when you get there, by the time you step off the dance floor you'll be on a first name basis! On another note I love the diversity of people that come out to Char's, it gives me hope for the planet!

I love this place, they should open a location on the West side of Phoenix then I could enjoy their food on a more consistent basis! I Love It!

I love this place! The food is great and feels like your eating authentic Mexican food not like Chipotle! I prefer the El Mirage location over the Surprise location because of its authenticy and the fact that its the original! If you go try the El Rico burrito in beef or chicken, or half and half you won't be disappointed! Only drawback is it that during our cooler Arizona months its packed with snowbirds!

This place is awesome!  It's comfort food prepared with a fancy flair. I would give it a higher rating but the menu basically consists of sandwiches and salads. Do one thing and do it well. I love it! #Fezburger #Goodeats

I'm never disappointed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they are always wearing a smile, if you want a real deli experience show up and place an order. (Hint) try the New Yorker.

My wife and I share an equal admiration for this place! I generally order the trio sampler which goes well with salad and bread sticks and my wife gets an order of mussels. This is our little get away from the kids on a Friday night secret! Great service even when they are busy!

I'm drunk but I feel that I have a duty to rate this place! Tex-Mex hip hop! This place is not a regular hang for me but when I do stop in it seems to be very "dude heavy", the music always seems to be to loud and you have to yell at the person sitting across from you. I'm not really feeling this place!

These guys always go above and beyond. Their customer service is always top notch even when there is a two hour back log. I don't mind spending my money and waiting when I'm treated with respect, thanks guys.

Stopped in to have lunch with my wife and we did not have a five star experience; however, upon our second visit we were impressed and would gladly return there to eat again. The staff and service are always great!

Stopped in for some Mediterranean comfort food and boy were me and my wife impressed! Our first couple of experiences eating here where so so which left me apprehensive about eating here again. Today's customer service and food where absolutely fantastic and I commend them for the excellent presentation of their dishes and the overall taste. I love Cane's (especially the Cane's sauce) so I will have some tough decisions to make in the future.

This place is at best OK..I've only had the burgers but there is nothing that distinguishes them from any other burger joint. Their prices are a bit steep, twelve bucks for a burger, fries and drink! Also the fries were soggy...not a plus in my book!

Awesome food. I was not disappointed and enjoyed every bite. The atmosphere was great and I'm a big fan of the Chipotle Cherry Steak tacos! Perfect spot to hang out smash a couple of tacos and have a beer.

What can I say? Somehow the Firehouse brainiacs have reinvented the sandwich! My favorite the beef and cheddar brisket (large of course) is a sweet symphony of flavor with a hint of spice at the end. Bottom line is that you can't go wrong with Firehouse because what they have done better than their competitors is the use of quality meats and customer service. I'm not gonna lie I eat at Subway but only because Firehouse doesn't have the same number of locations and at one time I was a faithful customer at Quiznos until the switched their meat supplier (ruined my fav sandwich). All in all the food is great and so is the customer service which makes it easier to lay down my hard earned cash for a great lunch experience. One more thing, always go large! You'll be angry at yourself if you settle for a smaller sandwich.

Firehouse is always great but the staff needs to work on the consistency of ingredients (too much or to little) I've found this to be true at other locations as well, especially in Maricopa.

Well I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and was underwhelmed with my experience. I expected a little more than the ho-hum barely there remodel that obviously had zero thought put into it, I really didn't see "The Cabin" look they were going for. Let's move on to the food my wife had the grilled pork chops and garlic mashed potatoes which the chops were slightly overcooked but the potatoes were good. I had the bbq pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw with a baked potato. I figure when eating at a bar stick to bar food. My sandwich was extremely dry and flavorless, shredded cardboard covered in bbq sauce would have tasted better! Thank god for the coleslaw and baked potato. We did have the stuffed jalape√±os which were good but the limp bacon they were wrapped in seemed to be under cooked. All in all it sucked but I gave it two stars because the new waitress was attentive and  friendly; however I will try it out one more time but if I have the same experience I won't be back.

The food was great. I played it safe with a chicken sandwich and onion rings but next time I'm all in on the Italian beef!

My wife and I have eaten here twice and we have been disappointed both times. We live here in Surprise and would love to make this our local hang but the quality of their food has left us wondering what's going on in the kitchen.  We love Texas Roadhouse but we will continue to drive to the I17 and Peoria location.
