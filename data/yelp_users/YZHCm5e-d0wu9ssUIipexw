Slightly awkward... But decent.. kinda over priced, kinda over hyped...but thats what i expected. Went here for my Beautyface's birthday dinner. I think we would try to visit the lounge next time, but I doubt we would return for the whole dinner thing. Should have sit on the patio instead of the stuffy dining area... Just not our cup of tea... the mansion is nice though.

Really enjoyed myself! We went here for dinner and a drinky. Tuesday special is chicken fried steak. It was pretty good, 8 out of 10. Reverse happy hour starts at 8. Half off appetizers and dollar off drafts. Had a house merlot for 2.50 that was pretty dlish. I will definitely be back here!  Happy hour starts at 8 PM... Awesome! Food is Awesome! My new favorite place! Go there...NOW!

Brought my bike in to get it repaired and left with both tires flat told that they are dry rotted even though they are less than 2 months old.  I don't believe that my bike was stored in the correct way.  I recommend fixing your bike yourself if you have the tools or the ability which I should have done in the first place I guess

LOVED THE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK!!! I will be honest, as long as a place has a good C.F.S, I'm in!! Been here plenty of times growing up. Check the website, maybe even call, but find out the specials that way you know what your gonna get... Next time Im gonna try the Apple Pie topped with a SLICE OF CHEESE???.....

I want to say thank you to the staff!  You guys were great!  I cant for the life of me get that gooey butter cake out of my mind, possibly the best thing I have ever had!   Can't wait to come back and try one of your famous steaks!

I really like this place a lot.  They have a great happy hour menu with a lot of small plate choices.  It looks small from the front, but it is quite large.  I really enjoy the patio out back.  Plenty of heaters for cold nights.  Food was very delicious!  Can't wait till the next time I hide my bike to rula bula.  Also patio is ultra dog friendly so that is an extra point for me!

Awesome after 10! REVERSE HAPPY HOUR.  The food they serve for H/H is HUGE portions. UFC is also shown here, no cover, but they kinda rape you on the drinks during the fight... 4.50 for a blue moon.... BUT they also discount the burgers half price... Do the research. call or check the site or fb for specials, or sign up for the email list.  I say, CHECK IT OUT!!!

Pretty annoyed with this place.  Only reason I am ok with giving them any stars, is they had Kiltlifter on tap, otherwise i would strongly campaign for a zero star review.  I got the "Miss Priss" it tasted like sour garbage. Mushy, warm, sour garbage. How do you mess up a turkey sandwich???  YUCK.  My friend got the "Hawaii chicken", he quickly named to vomity badness. the chicken breast was brown.... not dark meat, BROWN. I was going to take my leftover 3/4 of a sandwich and give it to a homeless person or something, but i didn't want to make they're day any worse... So long story short, if you wanna go spend 13.50....17.00 with tip, spend that money somewhere else because mill is popping off with waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy better places than this. chronic tacos next door looks interesting and the munchies deli as well.

kinda pretentious staff...the kind of, "i know they started a convo about me as soon as I left" vibe... Tthe food was pretty dang good...Happy Hour specials were pretty awesome as well...just kinda felt uncomfortable, as the wait staff were overly annoyed that people were using Groupons..I have to say Rare Earth just is not worth the drive...

In my opinion, the taco bowl is not good food at all.made my tummy very sad. . Not bad enough to make me rant about it. They did advertise happy hour a lot earlier i guess it starts at 3 or 4, they advertised it as 1... bartender picked up the first round for the confusion.

Well... ha ha.. it was ok... the food was really good until my second chicken fried steak "nugget"... like a giant piece of deepfried fat. Mashed potatoes were good had the horseradish flavor. delicious house salad, and my Lady Friend got the steak salad which she enjoyed.  fried ravioli was pretty original.. would have given more stars if the service was a little better, but i did come in at 9 pm on a friday night so... prob would not ever say "Hey lets all go to Cadillac Ranch" just not my type of place..

Well we returned to caddy ranch for dinner, as the management really does care about the reviews, we were invited back for a "make up" dinner...   BLOWN AWAY.  Like I said before, the food was phenomenal my  chicken fried steak was AMAZING.. I'm sure the reason for inviting us back was not to pad the review or get me to change what i said, just to change my outlook on the establishment, which they did indeed.. prob would just take my own advice and realize the food is AWESOME and original , and above all they really do care about whether you would return or suggest them to friends. I will definitely do both now!!!    Good Job Caddy Ranch!!

This place was awesome!!  Took my lady to Satara for our 2 year anny.  VERY ROMANTIC!  Tons of wine to choose from, we are more lovers of beer, which they had a great selection of as well. Food was fantastic.  scenery was nice. Water wall is a very nice touch. And i almost forgot, my new favorite thing : cucumber slices in the ice water!!! great idea!    Wanna make her happy???   Make a reservation to Satara!

Decent place to get drinks. Do a little homework on the drink specials. football is better now that it is not a gaytriots (patriots) bar.  You will have an awesome time as long as you go when there is a special on your poison. i like fridays... 2.50 kiltlifters.

Went here for lunch... used a coupon i had for a 1cent beer...not too shabby. tasted the newly unveiled pumpkin hefe...very good. tamales were pretty delish. main thing i wanna comment on is the one liter growlers... AWESOME!!!!!  i love the opportunity to take a beer home for later, and the fact i can take two well packaged growlers for the price of one normal growler...BTW 2  one liter growlers do equal 1 normal sized.  they do an awesome bottling job, first removing oxygen from the bottle, then filling the bottle with co2 to preserve the freshness... cant wait to get home and crack open my Red Rover....yummy

omg i wish i could put zero stars.  "rose" was rude to me from the moment i walked in...  my appointment was at noon.  upon arrival "rose" ,assumed,  "well, if your dog has never been groomed he is gonna give the groomer trouble".  i asked if they could try while i was still there so that i didnt leave him and get a call two hours later saying that they cant do it....  they put him on the table to try, and pig behaved like a gentleman.  they then shoved him back into the tiny cage.  so i asked what time they would be starting with him, and they said  they had three dogs ahead of him.  all i said was that i wish i knew how they did the appointments because i could have kept him in a normal sized cage at home until they were ready for him, not in a tiny cage.. "rose" then replied "well, you can just take your dog somewhere else".....damn straight i will rose... your customer service is horrible!!!   i will definitely not suggest anyone to let her around your pups.  the whole thing seemed a little shady.  even the other employee told "rose" that she shouldn't speak to me the way she did...if you love your dog ,please don't take your baby here!!

Arizona Balloon Safaris is the worst.  My balloon got cancelled due to rain.  There was no rain on Sunday.  I was treated with disrespect by the owner and when asked about rescheduling, was told "I have openings in mid April".  I told him that was unreasonable, as I reserved the ride at the very beginning of Feb, and he hung up on me.  I definitely recommend not wasting your time on a company that has that little respect for its customers.
