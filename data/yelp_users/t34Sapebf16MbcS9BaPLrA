I give this place a 5 star for food, but 1 star for service.   We ordered 4 different tapas, as well as alcoholic beverages. The Sparkling Sangria was nice, lots of fresh fruit inside.  The stuffed dates are a must. Tuna Peppers were quite tasty with just the right amount of spice. The fish sticks were delicious with a nice sauce for dipping.  And the Lamb Skewers were also very good, cooked to perfection.    However, once the waiter dropped off our food, he never checked in on us again. I expect a waiter to come by within at least 10 minutes of getting your food.  If he had, we would have ended up ordering another order of the stuffed dates, as well as another round or two of drinks.  But instead, 20 minutes after dropping off our food, we had to flag him down just to get our check.  It was not busy inside at all, so there was really no excuse for such crap service.  He had 0 personality, which was surprising considering his very exciting hair.   But like I said, the food was amazing, but our waiter ruined the whole experience.  I would come back, as long as I don't have him again.

This place is a hidden gem!  Disregard the shady looking casino. The prime rib is where it's at!   We really wanted a prime rib dinner without the hefty price tag of places on the strip. I found this on yelp, and I'm so glad I did!   $13.99 for a big ass prime rib, cooked to perfection, served with your choice of soup or salad, baked potato with all the fixin's, tasty green beans, ajus and horseradish, and a big beer to wash it all down.   Such a great deal and such a good meal! would definitely return on our next Vegas excursion.

I enjoy staying here on Vegas visits. I've stayed at a handful of other hotels, and for the price you pay, it's not bad. I stay here when it's cheap. I won't pay more than $50 for a hotel there. Rooms come with a keurig, chick is great because it's the only Vegas hotel I've been to that has a coffee maker, that saves me easily $5 a day.  The rooms are clean, and simple. The beds are comfy. I like the seating area with a table and couch. Self parking is among the easiest compared to other hotels.   I did too much day drinking last time and stayed in for the night while the man went out to play. I was too lazy/sick to go get food for myself so opted for room service. $15 for a sandwich is ridiculous but it was so convenient I didn't even care. And it was tasty and cured me.   The pool is fun. Crowded. But I like floating around in the lazy river and hope people don't pee in it. They also have a jacuzzi. I don't think I've ever seen another hotel that has a jacuzzi. Something about liability with the mixture of booze and heat. But I'm glad they have one.   They have tons of restaurants and a food court which is very easy. The pub was a good place to hit up for happy hour. Nice priced well drinks and food. Neat decor. No complaints really.

Stopped here for dinner twice on our 3 night stay at The Hard Rock.  I got the pink taco plate both times, that is how much I liked it the first time.  Perfect, delicious little tacos.  The rice and beans were also very good.  Most times they just taste like canned beans, and old dry, or overcooked rice.  Both of these were perfect.

Stopped in here late night during our stay at the Hard Rock. Got a couple sets of their shooters, which were so delicious.  Had the club sandwich to eat. You can't really go wrong with a club sandwich. Staff was nice, facility was clean. But it is all about those shooters.

Be prepared to get down and dirty here!!!!!  This place was so yummy!! Maybe even TOO yummy.  Definitely ate more than my little tummy could handle.   Had the shrimp with potatoes and corn.  So tasty.  Our waitress was nice, our service was great. I enjoy these kinds of places.  And I am glad that there is one near where I live.

This place was BLAH. From our blah waiter to our blah food.  Had the taco combo, came on a single thin street style tortilla, they seriously need to double the tortillas because it gave out midway through.  The pork was dry, the chicken was dry, the beef was ok.  Our waiter was nice, just a little awkward and lacking personality.

DEEEEEEEEEEEEElicious!! Ordered the BLT bloody mary. A little bit lost on how exactly to drink/eat it.  Also ordered the BLT to eat. (BLT kick??) Very good to both.  Bread was really good.   Ate off the man's plate too. He got scrambled eggs, which were overly cheesy so ask for less cheese if you don't like having equal parts egg to cheese.  They have really good biscuits and home made jelly.

Stopped by for their $5 shots a few times.  LOVE the $5 Cherry Bombs.  Didn't get anything to eat, but I would try it for food next time.   I thought the ladies serving booze were fun.. Even blew a whistle when we took our shots that made it seem more exciting and Vegas-like.

The theme to our trip seemed to be nothing but crappy service, until we went here!  Our waiter was so nice and helpful.  I liked that they tied the bibs on you, it is the little things that make a difference. Kept our glasses full, and checked in on us regularly.  We got a pound of shrimp, two orders of corn and potatoes in the Whole She Bang sauce, mild spicy, which was the way to go. As well as a bowl of gumbo with rice.  The gumbo was SO good.  Packed full with okra, shrimp and sausage.   I have been to that other place people compare this one too. And I will say, I liked this one more. I wasn't over loaded with TVs showing sports.  And it was as if they were playing my iPod, which I loved.   I was disappointed that they don't open until 3. We pulled up at 2, found out they weren't open but were starving, so drove through and grabbed a taco at el pollo loco next door, then wasted some time at a store then returned.  I am very excited that there are several of these around where I live in CA, and will be going to one of them out here to get my fill before my next trip to Vegas.

BRUSCHETTA! Whatever you do here, get the bruschetta. In fact, that's all we got!   Stopped in around 3 after our flight, being slightly hungry but not wanting to spoil our dinner. We also ordered cucumber lemonade ... Soooo good and refreshing. The outside area is fabulous. The waitstaff is pleasant and attentive. Huge fan of this place. If I lived in the area I would visit frequently.

This was so much fun!!!! I'm not much of a KISS fan, but not because I don't like them, just because I have never listened to them other than Detroit Rock City as a kid, and now with my KISS loving boyfriend.   This place was nothing like I was expecting inside, much smaller than I imagined, but surprisingly it is really well laid out, they really make it work.    You can also request any KISS song you want to hear.   Stop in the Liquor store right across the way and stock up on some booze to really get the fun started.   I lost miserably... but got a coupon for a free round of golf next time.

Staying at the Hard Rock, I wanted to check this place out.  It looked really cool inside, and their menu looked good and reasonably priced.   The inside was in fact really cool.  I liked that you could see all their fresh fish right there. We got a nice cozy booth.  I ordered the fish and chips.  The cod was very tasty, moist, flaky perfection. The chips AKA french fries were cold...bummer.   Overall it was good.  If you're staying in the Hard Rock, it is worth going to for dinner.

I had a lot of fun here. We did the day and night tour.  Had a little bit of time before it started, so we grabbed the best bloody mary I think I have ever had.   I am super gullible and super skiddish.  So I was glad we did the day tour before going back for the night tour, so I could actually look around and enjoy the bloody sights.  For awhile I thought it was actually REAL/true. hahaha but that's me being gullible.   We returned at night and it was SO creepy!  The characters were all very into it.  And they could tell I was skiddish and took full advantage of that.    Not sure if I would do it again, but it was fun, and amusing.

I wanted Howard Johnson to get my vote because my one night stay here was so nice.  The customer service, the rooms, and continental breakfast was very nice.  Seeing as I was here with Anthony A I will save your eyes from reading and just have you refer to his review, since he's a much better writer :)
