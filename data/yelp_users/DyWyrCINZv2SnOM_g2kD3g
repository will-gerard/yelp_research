Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!

I feel very comfortable and open with both Madison and Rachel Rhodes. I have received therapy and acupuncture. Their homeopathic approach to medicine is very reassuring. I have noticed a positive change in my health. I would recommend Mental wellness Naturally to my friends and family.
