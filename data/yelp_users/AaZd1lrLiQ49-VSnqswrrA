I have lived in AZ for over a decade. Dined at many sushi establishments. I luv sushi and sake! To my surprise Sushi Brokers is the worse establishment I've dined at; since I've eaten sushi- 10 years.  First, I wonder if the waiter has a memory bank the size of a split pea. He over charged my credit card. Simple fix right! No.The rude manager Devan behaved and treated me as if it was my fault. Seriouly? The Manger nor the waiter apologized for this mishap. So they void the charge. Then tried to charge my card again. I have fraud protection on my account. So the bank declined a new charge on my account for the correct amount. So I had to call my bank to confirm the purchase was good. The customer service rep at the bank said, "We apologize Ms. B, charges too fast and/frequent from the same establishment set off an alert to our system.  When a customer calls in we release the card.". Not a big deal right. Wrong! Its all about customer service,  the tone of the employees to its customers and how they treat them. This is where Sushi Brokers failed tonight. No apologies. To treat a paying customer rudely during an easy and fixable mistake is bad for business. I will tell my experience at Sushi Brokers to 10 people and they will tell many more. The cycle of storytelling regardless of the experience is powerful and never ends!

Best Japanese restaurant to go to at Westgate. Zane is the greatest bartender ever. I've gone to Kabuki's for the last 4 yrs and the customer service has never changed, always excellent and on point.  Key B's Recommendation: 100% yes, try Kabuki's!
