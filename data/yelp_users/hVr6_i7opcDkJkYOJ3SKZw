I tried this restaurant once.  They used so much MSG that my mouth hurt afterwards.  I won't go back.

Great Asian-style cakes with fruit topping -- not too sweet.  Awesome pastries, e.g. BBQ pork bun, coffee bun.  It is probably the best Asian bakery in Chandler, AZ.

Best Szechwan (Sichuan in Mandarin) restaurant in AZ.  Being Chinese and having lived in China for 2 years, this is the real deal.  My family dines at this restaurant almost weekly.   Our favorite dishes are Tong Qing Spicy Chicken, Crispy Onion Pancakes, Hot & Spicy Fish Fillet (aka fish fillet with hot chili peppers), Yu Xiang Rou Si (forgot the English name; it's pork strips with bamboo shoot).  Almost every Szechwanese dish that we have tried is good.  Other non-Szechwanese dishes may not be that great, e.g. beef noodle soup (niu rou mian), little dragon buns (xiao long bao).  My only complaint is the occasional sewage smell outside the restaurant.  I think it's fixed now.

I found this new Vietnamese restaurant on Yelp.  My family ordered 3 dishes: - Beef Noodle Soup with Beef Meatballs -Special House Broken Rice (Shredded pork, Steamed Pork Cake, BBQ Pork, Grilled Pork Patties) -Rice Vermicelli with Grilled Pork and Egg Rolls.  All dishes tasted awesome.  I think this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chandler, AZ.
