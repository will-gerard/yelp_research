I used to love this place! It's the only car wash i can drive in that won't scrape my wheels! The last five times I've been, my debit car wouldn't work (2 debit cards from different banks). Two times I didn't have cash on me and had to back out with high traffic behind me. The last time 12/30 the cash machine wasn't accepting my cash. I again, had to back out and leave. After 5 times of bad experience with their systems, I won't go back. Super embarrassing trying to back out. I've left messages with them to contact me, so I could make them aware but I've not received a call back. Hate to give bad reviews too.

The owner, Brad, is great!! Kept making suggestions to better my experience there. Food is good too! The first time I went they were a little slow but seems as if they've picked it up and are starting get people through the line quicker. Overall, I was pleased!
