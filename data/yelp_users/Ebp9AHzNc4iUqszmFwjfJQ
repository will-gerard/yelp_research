Phoenix airport (Sky Harbor) is one of the better airports to fly through.  Mainly because there's quite a few selections for bars / restaurants, as well as the weather there (hot / dry) means less chance of weather related lay overs.  = awesome.  Plus the "people-movers" are fantastic.

It's Vegas...   it has just about everything you would expect.  Slots, tons of food options, tourists thrilled to have arrived in Vegas, and those with broken spirits and empty wallets leaving Vegas... Definitely one of the better airports for people watching as well.

So I was in Phoenix for work, and had a chance to meet up with an old friend for dinner / drinks on a Thursday night.  After dinner, we stopped at Sandbar for a quick drink to catch up around 10'ish.  First off... outdoor bar in January?  Awesome.  Coming from CA, I'm used to the warmer-than-usual winters, but having 70-degrees at 10pm?  sweeeet.    The bar itself was average, the staff virtually non-existent besides the bartenders flirting with a few patrons.  ...and the patrons?  pretty much a mix of everything you could imagine.  Blue-collar workers, business men/women, scantily-clad women whose provocative nature screamed of low self-esteem, and jersey shore wanna-be's.  So yeah, they have a bit of everything.  Decent bar for people watching, but I doubt I'd return there unless forced.
