I adore this salon- it's the only one I will go to for nails. Very hygienic, and I never worry that my time will be cut short due to people waiting. I am always satisfied with my nails and the quality of service is exemplary. Don't listen to the people saying the nail technicians are unfriendly - they are all sweet and very accommodating. The salon atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, which is the way I like it. Sorry, but I don't come to the salon to be annoyed with loud noises and talking, I come to get pampered!

They have the grumpiest drive thru cashiers of all time. I drive out of my way to Broadway/32nd which is supremely slow service to avoid the grumps!
