My old man always said if you wanted to get rich you'd buy a Texan for what he was worth and sell him for what he thought he was worth. That about summarizes my feelings about TexAZ Grill. This is the most overrated place I've been to in a while.   I'd never been to TexAZ before today because I always seem to crave chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the place doesn't open until 11:00 a.m. Well, today I was craving chicken fried steak for lunch, so I thought I'd try out TexAZ out.   The size of the chicken fried steak is enormous, there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends. Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let's face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn't flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don't remember much about my mashed potatoes.   In summary: "Meh. I've experienced better." In fact, I enjoy the chicken fried steak at the JB's on 19th Ave. and Missouri more than the one here. I won't be returning.

Mediocre food.  Mediocre service. Sometimes you can, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and this place proves it.  I was going to write a long, detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today, but I'll let the fact that this is my first one-star review (and I've reviewed some real dives) speak for itself.

This business exudes "Customer Service."  Murphy's Law being what it is, I broke my glasses the week before I had to fly out of the country for my wedding. After poor experiences trying to remedy the situation at Optical Shop of Aspen and LensCrafters, I went to Ray Eyewear at my fianc√©e's suggestion. Ray, the business's namesake, and his wife walked me off the ledge I was on, helped me select a new frame, and rush ordered some lenses so that I would have the new glasses before I left for the wedding.  THEN, because the lenses in the pair I had broken were intact (I had broken the frame), Ray mounted them in a "loaner" frame so that I would have functional glasses while I waited for my new pair! Ray's selection of frames is great, the store is very cool, and you can't beat their customer service. I'm now a loyal customer.

I have had two dealings with Scott's Coach Works, and both were what I would call five-star experiences.  The first involves an unfortunate incident with a pillar in a parking garage last year.  Scott's was recommended by two friends whose opinions I value, and it's not far from where I live, so I chose them sight unseen.  I was not disappointed.  To begin with, Scott's workmanship impeccable - you'd never know how badly the car was damaged.  Moreover, Matt, the guy who was helping me out at Scott's, made dealing with my insurance company a breeze.  When I called the insurance company, they tried to steer me to one of their "preferred" body shops.  Matt made it clear to me that Arizona law does not allow the insurance company to mandate where I could have my vehicle repaired, and he handled communications with the insurance company after I had filed my claim.  My experience from beginning to end was professional and pleasant.  I had my second experience with Scott's last week. As I pulled into my parking garage at work, I rolled down my power window and then the window would not roll up. I was left with no choice but to carry my valuables up to my office, as I left my car with its window permanently rolled down.  I got to my office and called four repair shops, including my dealer, to ascertain what it would cost to fix the window.  They all identified the same problem and the quotes they gave me ranged from $500-$600.  I decided to go with Scott's based on my first experience there.  I again spoke with Matt, who told me to bring my car in the next morning.  I did so, and not only did they have it fixed by 2:00 that afternoon, but the total cost was well below their initial quote.  The service was top notch, and the car is as good as new.    Based on those two experiences, I wholeheartedly recommend Scott's Coach Works.

This place really hits the spot.  It's everything a hamburger place should be and nothing it shouldn't.  Their burgers are good-sized and delicious.  I attribute their scrumptiousness to the bread in the buns, but their meat is phenomenal as well; add some cheese and green chiles, and it's like a bunch of awesome ingredients decided to get together to take part in creating one of the best burgers in town with a little help from the grill.  The fries are effing good too.  The pitchers of beer are cheap and cold, and if you want to feed your inner hipster they also have bottles of PBR and cans of Schlitz.  Not a lot to feast the eyes on - the place has a real old-school "bar" feel - but the food compensates for what it may lack in elegance.

Really, I can describe this place only in superlatives. I've been here multiple times now, and it has never disappointed. Everything is cooked fresh, the flavors blend beautifully, and the owner is pleasant and informative.

This place is solid.  In fact, their corned beef hash is my gold-standard for judgment: with poached eggs and a little Tabasco, there are very few comparable meals as far as deliciousness goes.  The menu is pretty comprehnsive, and features, for instance, flapjacks.  Flapjacks, people ... flapjacks.  Name me another place in town that you can order flapjacks and I'll be impressed.  Anyway, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star joint in my book is the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of here for less than $20.  Maybe I'm crazy, but for a traditional American breakfast, I think that's expensive.  That doesn't seem to keep people - including myself - from frequenting the place, but on general principle I need to dock a star.

According to the adage, fools rush in where angels fear to tread. And so, only after my girlfriend and I suddenly found ourselves the new owners of a 6-week old Shih-Tzu puppy at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, did we begin to realize the magnitude of our predicament.  Wag N' Wash is on our drive home, so we called them to see if they were still open, and they informed us that they would be closing at 6:00.  We hurried there, hoping we could make it before they closed.  Our experience was top-notch.  Although we got there a few minutes before 6:00, nobody raised an eyebrow.  Employees at many places would resent having to help a customer who showed up at closing time, and would rush that customer.  Not here.  There were four employees cleaning and tidying up.  They all came over to meet our new family addition, and were genuinely happy to help us put together a "puppy starter kit."  Their suggestions were particularly helpful to me, as a first-time dog owner.  Even the groomer who was still there came out to meet her, and offered up a "sanitary" clipping and wash.    On Sunday, we commented several times about how much harder it would have been to have gotten through the first night if the good folks at Wag N' Wash hadn't been so awesome.  So we went back!

I've been on a Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) kick for the past month or so.  My banh mi bellwether is definitely Lee's Sandwiches, but Chandler is quite the trek for me, so I've been on the lookout for good banh mi in CenPho.  I read about Thao's Sandwiches here on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch yesterday.  By far, the best part of my Thao's experience was the price.  I ordered a grilled pork (thit nuong) banh mi, and it cost me all of $2.71.  It's hard to complain about anything if you're out less than $5.00.  The sandwich's innards were all delicious.  The vegetables were fresh and pleasing to the eye, and the grilled pork was thinly sliced, as I like it.  As far as the inside of my sandwich, I'd give it 4 stars.    But my favorite part of bahn mi is the bread, and the bread at Thaos did not meet expectation yesterday.  I want my banh mi bread crispy on the outside and soft below the crunchy crust.  The Thao bread was uniformly soft - it was like a Vietnamese torta or something.  And that made me sad.  I really wanted to look past that, but it was impossible for me.  Also, the customer service left a lot to be desired.  It seems like Vietnamese establishments sometimes get a pass on this criteria, but they shouldn't.  I ordered my sandwich, and when I told the woman at the cash register that I was planning on eating it on site, she gave an exasperated sigh, and looked across the restaurant, scanning - it was evident there were several four tops available, but it was almost lunch time, and I think she felt like I'd take up space better used by a group larger than my one-man party.  I didn't want to disappoint her, so I told her I'd take the sandwich to go, and brought it home instead.  Oh well.  So overall, I give Thao's two stars - if the bread were better, I suppose I could have given it a third. But I'll keep on my quest for the best banh mi in town, and likely not return.

I have to get all of my dress shirts tailored, and I've been taking them to Brothers Tailors since 2001. In that time, they've tailored everything for me from jeans to shirts to suits. Their tailoring is top-notch. I think of a good tailor the way I think of a good barber - you really need to be able to trust him/her, and through-and-through Brothers has earned my trust. Nice folks and reasonable prices, too.

After driving by this place countless times, I finally stopped by today. I eat cheesesteaks maybe twice a year, but I do enjoy a good one.  Well, Ricky's delivers a delicious cheesesteak. In fact, If I were using Corleone's as a competitor, Ricky's would leave them in the dust. The meat is good, and they don't overdo it on the cheese. The highlight, however, is the bread - the best cheesteak bread I've had in the Valley. It's not too soft, and not too hard - it's just right and gave me enough of a grip to make this one of the cleanest-eating cheesesteaks I've ever had.

This place gets two stars from me, and one of them is for its design.  It's the kind of place that I really, really, wanted to like and didn't.  It's inviting from outside and the inside does "spartan-chic"  very well.    The eating, experince, however, was nothing short of disappointing.  My dining companion commented that it felt like a cafeteria.  There was no service to speak of, and I had to fetch my drink out of a refrigerator.  You'd think that would keep the price down, wouldn't you?  Well, it didn't.  I ordered the pigs-in-a-blanket, and the blanket was awful.  I ended up eating the pigs, which were uncanny in appearance and taste to the sausage links that my high-school band sold as a fund-raiser.   A downer of a place in more ways than one, not the least of which is that its decor is writing checks that its food isn't cashing.

I'm a little stingy with the five star rating, but three words describe how I feel about Gallo Blanco: "F*ck yeah, Jesus!"  I eat at Gallo Blanco at least twice a week, and I think they serve the best tacos and tortas in Phoenix.  Hands down.  On this past Monday night, I went on a taco bender and ate nine tacos in a row - three cochinita pibil and six carne asada.  I really couldn't get enough of them.  And they have Negra Modelo on tap; I don't know why I ever eat anywhere else.  Gallo Blanco is a Mexico City style taqueria, and based on my visits to the D.F., it succeeds in its authenticity.  But Gallo Blanco is also a pretty cool place to eat in good ole Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A.  Good food transcends ethnic boundaries.  While the tacos are delicious, Gallo Blanco is more than just tacos - a standout on their menu is the elote - a cotija cheese and paprika spiced cob of corn.  And the guac; where to start with the guac . . . whoever came up with the recipe was a culinary genius.  Did I mention that Gallo Blanco is a great value, too?  Their chorizo and egg breakfast weighs in at an easy-on-the-wallet $5.00.  The tacos hover in the $2.00 price range depending on the ingredient.  Dinner for two, with drinks, can be had for a very reasonable price tag.  Even the drinks are kick ass: I had the opportunity to sample Gallo Blanco's margarita ($7.00) one Thursday evening, and then Barrio Caf√©'s "Cadillac" margarita ($12.00) the next day.  Edge: Gallo Blanco.   Here's a tip: try Gallo Blanco's chilaquiles for breakfast.  Chilaquiles are best described as "breakfast nachos;" they are basically corn tortilla pieces cooked in salsa, and sprinkled with cheese, served for breakfast with eggs.  They're very popular as a breakfast in Mexico, and I think there's a good reason for that: they're damn tasty.

I have to admit . . . I'm sort of pissed off that I seem to have become addicted to this place.  The last thing I need is another $3.00 per day habit.  However, as far as drive-through coffee goes, this place is about as good as it gets.  The coffee is so piping hot that they offer an ice cube should you need one; it smells heavenly and sips smoothly.  The cup-lid is strange at first - like a child's sippy cup - but it's part of their shtick and doesn't interfere with one's enjoyment.  I've only had their Dutch Coffee, but do so a few times a week now, and I must say it knocks the socks off of any drive-through Americano.

I was never really a big fan of Fate, although I do like Asian foods in their various incarnations.  So, when I heard that Matt Carter was doing an Asian restaurant in it's place, I was cautiously optimistic.    I got to try Nine|05 for dinner during its soft opening this week.  I was pleasantly surprised to see Jay Bagsinske as the chef, and the place continued to positively impress me from there.  First, the menu promises to bring some of my Asian favorites together in one place: kimchi and banh mi?  Together?  I'm drooling as I type this.  Neither of those was available during the soft opening, but I'm going back next week to try them.    What I did eat was nothing short of delicious:  I'm not usually a fan of duck, but the duck confit appetizer was scrumptious, and left me wanting more; the menu repeatedly features pork-belly (delicious soft bacon-like chunks of pork in no way related to or similar to menudo), and I have to say that the the pork belly fried rice was awesome.  I could go on and on . . . plus the service was great.  Moreover, the dining environment is a BIG improvement on Fate's.  I never liked Fate's darkness, or decor, which always struck me as just sort of thrown-together haphazardly.  Nine|05 makes big use of hard-wood to give it a vaguely Asian sense without being kitschy.  Lastly, the prices at Nine|05 were surprisingly reasonable.  Matt and Jay, I will be back.

I do like a good torta. Currently, in my book the king of tortas in Phoenix is Gallo Blanco. However, sometimes I don't want such a fine dining experience. There are days when I want quick and cheap; and when I want a quick, cheap, and good torta, there's one place that has not let me down: Tortas Paquim√©.  As a biographical aside, I actually visited Paquim√©, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua back in the spring of 1995. My first torta was prepared by a Tarahumaran Indian over a wood fire at Copper Canyon nearby there.  But I digress...  A buddy of mine who is originally from Ciudad Chihuahua turned me on to Tortas Paquim√© when I asked him what he thought was a good, authentic torta place in the Valley. He noted, and I must agree, that the fact that they bake their own bread on-site makes all the difference.  I've had a few of their numerous tortas, and have not had a bad one.  Nor have I heard any of my co-workers who have accompanied me there complain.  The place is spotlessly clean. In fact, the cleanliness and order there is a little jarring at first visit. The staff is very nice, and completely bilingual. And the tortas are not only good, but they are also pretty cheap. All in all, this is delicious food at a great value in a clean, friendly place.

I love Vietnamese food.  On the Asian-cuisine spectrum, it's pretty close to my favorite.  I was a long-time fan of Pho Bang, which occupied the same spot as Pho Thanh for as long as I lived in Phoenix.  Pho Bang had definitely seen some better days by the end of its run in early 2009: the place smelled like stale cigarettes, the restroom was perpetually out-of-order, and the staff ambled around in a sort of dissociative fugue.  Regardless of all that, I never stopped liking their food.  I was saddened when they closed, and hadn't a chance to try out their replacement until tonight.  Pho Thanh finally put its sign up; I think that's what drew me in.  I barely recognized the place.  The former Pho Bang had received a complete makeover - gone is the stale cigarette smell; new flooring and bright lighting now greet you upon entering.  A wall-mounted wide-screen TV has replaced the old 27-inch Magnavox surrounded by pirated videocassettes that was a fixture at Pho Bang.  In one word, Pho Thanh is clean.  For a Monday night at 8:00, the place was pretty full.  To pass the time, I picked up a copy of Phuong Hoang - the Arizona Vietnamese Magazine - and sat down to explore what it would be like to be illiterate.  As this was my inaugural Pho Thanh run, I decided to size the place up by its bun thit nuong - rice vermicelli noodles with grilled pork.  I've found that it's easier to judge a Vietnamese restaurant by its bun than by its pho, as the component ingredients can be evaluated individually.  I was happy to see that the cleanliness had not come with a higher price tag; the bun dishes all fall in the $5.00 price range.  My server seemed genuinely happy to be working, and his alacrity was a welcome change from the service I had been accustomed to at Pho Bang, as was his promptness in bussing tables as guests left.  I had my fingers crossed, hoping that the food would not let me down.  It didn't.  My serving of bun thit nuong was enormous - bigger than my head.  I tend to like my thit nuong (grilled pork) thinly sliced, as Pho Bang used to do, but Pho Thanh prepares it as Da Vang does - on the thick side.  That's my only "complaint," and it's still delicious.  I found the nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) particularly tasty at Pho Thanh.  Better than Da Vang's and Maxim's in my opinion.  They also add pickled daikon radishes to the dish, which takes the deliciousness up a notch.  Pho Thanh serves no alcohol, which is actually all right with me, since I never really crave a beer with my nuoc mam anyway.  At any rate, I wish I had tried this place earlier.  It turns out I don't miss Pho Bang as much as I thought I did.  I look forward to exploring Pho Thanh's menu in earnest, now that I've given them a shot.

Who am I kidding, sticking to my 4-Star rating? I come to this place several times a week and it's ALWAYS delicious.  I've tried their pho, their banh mi, their bun bo hue, and it's all top-notch. When it comes to Vietnamese cuisine in Phoenix, this is as good as it gets!

I've been to Petit Fromage twice in the last six days, and it has resulted in two marvelous cheese plates.  Petit Fromage has a great cheese selection - a definite tribute to Lara Hardwick's taste in cheese - without a trace of pretentiousness.  The world of cheese is well represented, but not overwhelming.  The charcuterie is almost as impressive as the fromagerie, with multiple selections of jam√≥n, prosciutto, salumi, and chorizo.  Add a healthy selection of sundries from around the cheese-eating world, and you can easily walk out spending more than you would in a fancy restaurant.  And I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  Four stars on the first week, with definite potential for five once the place finds its equilibrium.

Well, after a mere month, I'm updating my review of Petit Fromage to reflect that they are the Five-Star shop I knew they could be.  I just stopped in for lunch and hade one of Lara's "Petite Snacks" for lunch, and am radiating happiness for having done so.  I can only refer to Petit Fromage in superlatives based on my experiences there over the past month.  Customer service is tip-top, the selection is great, and the shop really fosters a sense of community.  Life is good with a cheese shop such as this in the neighborhood.

Best. Manhattan. In Arizona.  This is a place for the discerning drinker -- for someone who appreciates the craft of the cocktail, a minimum amount of pretension for a "Scottsdale" bar, and a great atmosphere.

For those of you who fancy yourselves urban adventurers, if you find yourselves in the vicinity of 27th Ave. and Van Buren you could do a lot worse than Taqueria Guadalajara.  That may sound like damnation by faint praise, but it's really not.  What I mean to say is that at the end of the day I'd rather have a taco at Gallo Blanco, America's, or La Condesa.  But those places are playing in a whole other ballpark - hell, a whole other game - and they're catering to a whole other demographic than Taqueria Guadalajara is.  I first heard about this place at a "taquiza" first-birthday party that I attended in one of Phoenix's historic neighborhoods.  The kid's folks are lawyers, and I guess they wanted to bring a bit of authenticity to their Mexican-themed party (to compliment their custom-made robot shaped pi√±ata - very authentic).  The Taqueria Guadalajara van was parked outside their house, and a very nice Mexican woman had set up a grill in the back yard and was making tacos to order - carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas - along with a full condiment bar.  It was pretty f'n cool.  I ate eight tacos, and was stuffed.  I thought the "taquiza" was a brilliant idea, took their card, and told my girlfriend and her family about it.  They thought it was a great idea too, and thought it might be good for an upcoming party they'll be having at their house.  I decided to do some due diligence before I gave that idea my blessing.    I checked Taqueria Guadalajara's license with Maricopa County's Environmental Services Department (I often do this with restaurants, and that's how I knew about True Food Kitchen's critical health code violations a while back).  Taqueria Guadalajara had no red flags on their report.  Today, my girlfriend, her mother, and I sojourned down Van Buren to check out the actual digs.  The place was very clean and easy on the eyes in every sort of way.  As my lady said: "I shouldn't like these baby-poo colored walls, but I do."  Among the three of us, we ordered four tacos al pastor, four carne asada tacos, two carnitas tacos, a quesadilla, two Diet Cokes and an horchata, and our bill was $21.00.  All the tacos were savory.  Nothing really stood-out about them, but then again, nothing about them was bad.  The condiment bar was fully-stocked with the typical Mexican taco-goodies (salsas, pickled carrots, radishes, onions, etc.).  The food was ready quickly, and we were served with a smile.  Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.  As I said, I don't foresee myself making the trip to 27th Ave. and Van Buren for this stuff, but if you're in the neighborhood, you can stop by and expect a good experience.  If you're looking for someone to use for an authentic "taquiza" at your place, look no further.

I had lunch at Sekong by Night with a couple of foodnik friends on its second day of business.  Overall the experience was worthy of four-stars.   First, the design - it appears to have formerly been a Mexican restaurant and an Italian eatery of sorts, and vestiges of both decors abound, though the owners have gone to great lengths to give it an Indochine feel. All around a pleasant dining atmosphere with spacious booths flanking a long table that would be suitable for a large group.  The food was great; it was like Vietnamese food's understated cousin, which I guess it technically is.  The menu offered a handy guide to the meals, and often compared a dish to it's Vietnamese counterpart.  I had a spring roll, which was large and delicious. The fish sauce it came with appeared to be nuoc mam, but was a little sweeter than the nuoc mam at other places around town. Katheaw is the Cambodian cousin of pho, and in presentation looks exactly  like pho (vermicelli noodles in a broth with meats and vegetables); the broth, however, bore no taste resemblence to pho broth, and if anything tasted more like chicken noodle soup than pho. I opted for the Katheaw Phnom Pehn, and while I found it delicious, be aware that it is offal-heavy, and if you don't like the taste of liver, you won't like the amount they put in it.    My lunch companions' meals looked delicious, and I had a taste of one of their sandwiches.  Again, the sandwich was very similar to banh mi (those French made inroads on the local Southeast Asian cuisine, I'll tell you), but featuring beef rather than pork, and heavy with the taste of lemongrass, which I'd never noticed in the banh mi I've had.  I'm a junkie for Pho Thanh, but I suspect I'm going to put Sekong by Night into the rotation.

Talk about bang for your buck! I've now been to Sinbad's twice, and both times I left stuffed to the gills, and eagerly awaiting my next visit, and thinking about what I'll order when I return.   The menu has all the standard Middle Eastern staples; the clientele in my two visits has been almost exclusively Arabic-speaking; the location is "hole-in-the-wall." The entrees are big enough to share, and are served with free appetizers of hummus, Arabic pickles, and jajeek.  All in all, worth the drive to the West side.

I drove by this place last week, and it looked inviting, so I swung by today. Overall it was delicious. You know when people say meat "falls off the bone"? The meat on the ribs here literally fell off the bone; I had do ask for a fork as a result. The sauce was very tasty; its in a squeeze bottle and I wanted it to have been warm, rather than room temperature, but my tastebuds didn't seem to care. It was very clean, reasonably priced, and the service was friendly. I'd return by myself, and with others.
