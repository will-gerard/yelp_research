I hold many fond memories of the Phoenix Zoo.   We've been a zoo member family for a long time. My first homecoming dance in high school was held in the gorgeous ballroom here. I remember back in the day coming and watching Ruby the elephant paint.  My favorite thing about this zoo is that it's non-profit. I've heard rumors that they don't treat their animals very well which breaks my heart but honestly the animals here seem a lot happier than animals I've seen at other zoos.   Zoolights is always a fun family event too. We look forward to it every year.

There are seriously some mornings in my house where my family will look at eachother ...say, "Donuts?" and we all magically know that this donut craving can't be satiated by simply Dunkin. Though these mornings are few and far between because my family has more of a convenience over quality attitude, they do occur.   My mother discovered Rainbow donuts because she works in Phoenix and before Dunkin had its viral takeover of Arizona, it was the only place to get donuts on the way to the office.  As far as donuts go I honestly don't think there's a way that Rainbows donuts could be any better. Maybe if they were covered in diamonds and had reverse calories. Everything they have tastes fresh even if it's bought at closing time. The prices are so cheap that I wonder how they even stay in business. The employees are always super friendly.   Convert your donut religion to Rainbow donuts today. See the light. Repent!

I wish I could give this place less than one star. It was easily the worst experience of my life!   Let me just start by saying that I had completely virgin hair. I had NEVER dyed it before in my life. I went here because my mother claimed it was a great place. It was very posh. They served me iced tea in a wine glass. I just wish they had used the money for that to hire better stylists.   Wendy, was younger than I was, and had an attitude with me from the start. I told her that I wanted to go light blonde (think lady gaga or christina aguilera). I'm a natural brunette. She instantly told me that it would look terrible and that she refused to do it. Then she continued to have every single stylist in the place back her up and tell me how stupid I was for wanting it. Finally she said she would do me a few shades lighter and since my mother suggested her, I decided to just go with it. Instead of making me a few shades lighter she proceeded to give me orange and yellow streaks in my dark brown hair.  Halfway through she started cutting and styling another womans hair (even though I had an appointment and she didn't.) I had to sit for about an hour reading (not under a dryer) while she finished up the other woman. By the time she was done with me I was devastated. She asked me what was wrong and i said "Well it's not blonde enough and I don't really like highlights. I told you this." She took a piece of the yellow she made and said,  "THIS ISNT BLONDE TO YOU? ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS ISNT BLONDE!?"  Then took me around the entire salon and had every stylist tell me that it looked amazing and I was a "hot blonde". Every single stylist then told me how horrible what I wanted would have looked and that I should be thankful that Wendy did what she wanted instead of listening to me.  I felt horribly bullied and left there 200 dollars poorer and covered in embarrassing orange and yellow stripes. I spent weeks wearings hats and headbands to cover up the horrible mistake.   It wasn't just the bad hair job, because I could have understood that. But it was the fact that she insulted me and bullied me the entire time and then proceeded to give me the opposite of what I asked for. Why didn't she just tell me from the beginning that she couldn't help me? It would have saved me the $400+ that it cost to correct the mistake she made.

So yeah the manager of this store printed out my review to show my mother last time she went in. LMAO SERIOUSLY WHO DOES THIS?  Basically I get bullied through the entire hair experience and then my mother comes home complaining that now she feels uncomfortable because they were unhappy with my review. So I'm assuming they were trying to bully me into taking this down? Well, take that as you will. Any company that tries to bully you into taking down a poor review is completely unprofessional in MY opinion.  As for Wendy apparently she feels really bad about the job and showed remorse (I would too after reading my review) so I'm posting my UPDATE to say that my hair actually wasn't VIRGIN. I had some box color and that might be why it came out so yellow. That still has nothing to do with the fact that I didn't want streaks or that kind of dye job. She still should have just told me no. She has since apologized for it which is very respectable and professional on her part.  But of course those are such tiny details that are now corrected but overshadowed by the fact that the owner printed out my review as if he was in high school and tried to bully me into taking it down by showing my mother. Hello, I'm an adult and I'm entitled to my opinion. I may be a lot of things but I am not a liar. The owner has also told my mothers friend who recommended her to the place trying to pit them against each other. I seriously can't believe that the owner of a business would pull this high school drama and embarrass two of his long term customers like this.   I feel horrible for my mother because she should be able to retain a business relationship as a paying customer without being hassled about her daughters opinion of the place.

I feel that I'm cursed with the fact that I'm a small girl who has a boyfriend with a large appetite. He always wants to go to buffets and I always feel like it's a waste because I usually can barely finish off one plate.  We came into Kopper Kettle since it's right next to one of our other favorite restaurants. The service was extraordinary. The manager/owner asked us if we had ever eaten there before. We told him it was our first time and I had eaten indian food before but he was new to it. He then took us around the buffet and explained each dish to us, what was in it...the level of spicy...and what it goes best with. It was the nicest thing ever because my biggest fear in restaurants is mystery meat since I can't eat pork or shellfish.   The owners wife was our waitress and she kept our drinks filled and was constantly asking if everything was good or not. Which by the way IT WAS. I've had a lot of indian food but their buffet really took the cake. It was wonderful.   At the end of our meal we were surprised however, because the total for two buffet dinners was almost forty bucks! The food and service were amazing but forty bucks seemed a little steep to me. Maybe if I was a normal American who could wolf down four plates and then go back for dessert it would be worth it...but whenever I go to buffets I feel sort of ripped off since I can't take anything home and I barely eat.     Overall~ Food: Amazing Service: Amazing Atmosphere: Amazing Price: Disappointing

As horrible as this sounds, I'm used to Korean restaurants on the east coast. Translation: Amazingly authentic food + terrible service if you're white. Not that I blame them.  This place was amazing. Easily the best Korean food that I've ever had. The service was so wonderful and quick that I almost forgot I was a white person in a Korean restaurant. It was a very classy experience even though the place is sort of set up like a cafeteria.  My only complaint is that I wish they had more Bibimbap options. There were only two. But I suppose that's because there is an emphasis on the BBQ portion of the menu.   The price to me was worth it.

The employees here are always so polite. Maybe they're just playing the part but they're always really overtalkative silly old japanese men.   As a retarded American, I fall for this every time and am overwhelmed by an adorable experience.  Plus they have Mr Pibb, so I'm a happy camper whenever I pass by.

I always wonder how this place has stayed in business so long. Greg must be loaded and just do this for the passion of it. Last time I came in here the man working gladly helped me find what I needed and ordered what I wanted. He even had them waiting for me when I went in again.   He was also really knowledgeable on his stuff. He wasn't some breathy creepy neckbeard working in a comic shop. As a girl I'm usually terrified to take the adventure into one of these lion dens to pick up what I want because it can be pretty scary. He was simply a nice old man.   I'll continue to come here for all of my comic book needs :}

My boyfriend and I have been going to IchiBan constantly for sushi for the past two years. We love it. They know us and always greet us with complimentary edamame and sometimes even soup. At the end they even bring us fruit!  Ever since half price sushi, there's just no reason for us to ever go anywhere else for sushi. We love it.  As far as the cooking tables, I'm not a fan. I like cooking tables at other places but IchiBan is a much better sushi restaurant. The cooks are friendly and creative and entertaining but the food itself is just sub-par and the prices are a little high.   All in all an AMAZING sushi place but I wouldn't suggest going for the hibachi tables.

This is my favorite sushi restaurant. I'm always completely blown away by the sushis presentation, taste, and well...everything. Theyve been replaced by a much cheaper sushi restaurant but I still think fondly of Sakana. Easily the best sushi in Arizona. Just too pricey for me to frequent ;{

I don't even know where to begin. If you need a costume, come here. The employees are so friendly and very helpful. The rental fees are very reasonable considering their costumes are stage quality.   The store used to be an old bank and the way they transformed it is just way cool. It's fun to come here even just to look around.   Actually, even if you don't need a costume go check it out. It's a fun experience no matter what.

I've always been a fan of Mimis but it had been about three years since my last visit. My mother and grandpa decided they wanted to do lunch there and I was happy about it. I remembered the location in Mesa being better but since I used to live in Scottsdale, that was the one I frequented.   The menu was basically the exact same as it was three years ago. That could be good or bad. Take it as you will. It was SO crowded. Apparently every single person over 65 decided to go to lunch that Friday afternoon. The food was good but kind of expensive. My mother and I shared a sandwich since we're both small eaters and my grandpa ordered his own. The bill was still about forty bucks for two meals and three iced teas. Even if the food was good that was still YIKES!  But the service was what made me decide to stick to the Mesa location if I ever go again. The waiter took our orders, brought us our drinks once and then vanished off the face of the earth. Maybe he's Superman, IDK!  A busboy brought us our food and we had to ask another busboy for our bill. Our waiter made his final appearance just as we'd paid to thank us for coming in. It was awful nice of him to return after being absent for thirty minutes and making the busboy do his job.

After reading reviews I was a little afraid to return to this store after their revamp. I hadn't been for years. I was pleasantly surprised though. The employees were very helpful and knowledgeable.   They had a great selection of fish and reptiles. The prices were a little higher than the prices would be at petsmart but I'm sure that has something to do with the fact that it's smaller and family owned (also their fish aren't covered in ick) So I'm okay with the prices. :}

Mal is my stylist. She fixed a horrible mistake of a mess that someone at another salon made and always gives me what I want. She's a blast to talk to and never overcharges me. I always get what I go in for and never leave unsatisfied. I won't ever go to another stylist :}  Everyone else in the salon seems really cool too. They understand what I want and never talk down to me or overcharge me.

As an avid lover of the ocean and fish, I live a very sad life here in land-locked Arizona.   For our anniversary my boyfriend surprised me by taking me here. It was the best aquarium experience of my life. I've been to many aquariums in more aquatic states and I still prefer this one. It was small enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed and big enough that I felt satisfied.   It appears that they treat their animals VERY well. Everything we saw looked happy and healthy. We didn't check out the zoo section because we came later in the day when it was closed but I would love to check it out next time. We did see giraffes peeking at us though!   It was a very pleasant nice quiet date. Seriously, way less crowded than any other zoo.

I don't like bagels at all but I came here because my boyfriend made me and seriously I fell in love. These bagels are SO good you don't need cream cheese or butter or anything. But just in case you want some, they have it. I'm pretty sure their cream cheese is homemade and they offer all sorts of toppings including hummus.   I haven't eaten lunch there but they also have a very wide variety of bagels. Their rosemary bagel is amazing! I've had nothing but good experiences here. It's strange to me that this place has such a low rating but I guess everyone has off days.  My ONLY complaint is the prices are a little steep for bagels but then again...they are amazing bagels.

Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts. It's my first choice of healthy grocery stores!  They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes. Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice. Seriously I can't stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts. They're such pretentious jerks sometimes.   Whether I need lamb or bison meat, coconut milk ice cream, or almonds...this is always my first choice. They're also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese. Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random. I will never stray from Sunflower again!

I've been coming here since I was in high school. The employees are always super helpful and the selection is great. One time my boyfriend purchased salmon sashimi from there that was less than desirable. He didn't have to bring it back or even have a receipt. The manager apologized to him and let him come back for a free slab of salmon. That's a rare find in a business.   Today we bought sashimi and they included a block of ice so it didn't thaw on the drive home. Super cute :}

I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to Mexican food since I was raised on the good stuff.   The other day I had to have a burrito. I don't know why but NOTHING else would satisfy me. It had to be a bean burrito.   I made myself fresh tortillas for this purpose alone but I realized we didn't have any beans!! Frantically I called my grandma to ask if she had some and she said she just ran out. I didn't have all day to make fresh beans. I wanted a burrito now!  So finally I sucked it up and drove down the road to fiesta burrito. I thought to myself that as long as it was better than Taco Bell, I'd be able to satisfy my craving.  FOUR BUCKS FOR A DRIVE THROUGH BEAN BURRITO!?  I thought to myself that this was kind of expensive but I got it anyways. After all, I needed a burrito. What I got was worth it's weight in mexican gold.  What I was given was the biggest burrito that I'd ever seen in my life. Seriously this burrito could have ended me if it chose to. It was the best bean burrito that I'd ever had. Maybe even more than my grandmas homemade ones. I can't even begin to describe the joy I felt while eating this thing. I couldn't even eat half of it in one sitting. It actually became THREE separate meals for me. Each time I reheated it, it was still just as good as the first.   I know my mexican food, and this is probably the most authentic in the valley.

This is my favorite antique store ever. The first time I went with my 16 year old cousin and she had so much fun seeing all the vintage fashion. I took my mother the following week and she was almost in tears from all the nostalgic things she saw. Then when I took my Grandfather he literally looked like a child in a toy shop upon seeing all the war memorabilia. Even my 13 year old brother had fun there seeing all the Star Wars and Simpsons stuff. I plan to take my bf there eventually to check out the Beatles things.   Basically what I'm saying is that there isn't a person in the world who could be bored in this place! I love it.   The staff was very friendly and helpful. At first they didn't take me too seriously because I look really young but Im an avid Dr Seuss collector and after they realized I actually wanted to buy stuff the lady literally walked me through the entire store digging for things.

I'm convinced that this is the smallest Peter Piper in existence. A little cousin of mine had his 11th birthday party here and it was embarrassing. There are like four games and there isn't a ballpit at all.  When we first got there they hadn't even set up for the party yet and we were on time. I asked one of the employees if there was a party schedule for 2pm and she snaps, "I HAVE NO IDEA" and gave me the dirtiest look ever. It was so rude. I get that you work at Peter Piper and you're probably upset about that but don't take it out on me.   I tried to play Deal or No Deal with my cousin to just try to have fun and was bombarded by unsupervised Mexican children begging me for tokens and tickets and screaming at me how to play the game. Where were their parents at?   The location in Mesa is much better! It's bigger than a Chuck E Cheese and the staff is way friendlier. Avoid this location at all costs.

Very authentic!  What I mean is, authentic enough that if you don't know some spanish you're going to have a very hard time ordering here. This is the only place my family goes for mexican meat or baked goods.   Seriously, walking into this store is like taking a little trip to Mexico itself.  A little scary at first, but totally worth it.

What an adorable little idea. I was afraid they would go out of business when BevMo started getting big in Arizona but I'm glad to see it's still doing well.   It used to be a must hit stop for me when I was a teen. Now that I'm a little older my tummy and teeth can't handle all that stuff but I still have fond memories of it. Does anyone else remember when it was a TINY little nook? Their new location is much nicer.

The owner contacted me about my review and offered me a free sub card to make up for the veggie sub that I wasn't satisfied with. This was so incredibly professional of him. I will definitely give them another shot for that reason alone. It takes a very caring and professional owner to do something like that.

The new owner is doing something very right because when I was in high school everybody knew this place as the filthy 'dive' of Hookah Bars. It was the one that you went to if all the others were busy and the easiest one to sneak underage kids into.   I miss the old art and Alice in Wonderland type chairs, but everything else has been improved GREATLY. The music isn't too loud or soft, the girl at the front was so friendly and helpful (it was my friends first time with hookah), and they had a wide variety of flavors.   The ONLY problem I have is that they don't serve drinks or food. Even if they aren't going to have food they should at least do fountain drinks. People get thirsty!  Edit: The owner actually contacted me to tell me that due to some stupid rules they can't do fountain drinks but they do sell bottled drinks at the front. That alone shows an owner that cares!  Five stars all around!

This is my absolute favorite place to hunt for first edition Dr Seuss books. The owners are so very kind and everytime I go they have no problem helping me dig through the childrens books and they always know off the top of their head just how many Dr Seuss books they have so we aren't looking for no apparent reason.   I'll always have fond memories of this place providing me with my very first 1st edition Dr Seuss book ;}

I won't take my dog anywhere else!  Lola is a pretty unhealthy 3 year old Lhasa Apso. She was a rescue that came from a puppy mill and and an abusive master. I love her with all my heart but I swear you can look at her wrong and she'll fall deathly ill.   Last year I took her in when she was very sick and they diagnosed her with pyrometra. The doctor was so helpful and informative and even let me set up a payment plan because I couldn't afford the surgery up front.   By now they know her and her various issues. A few months back I took her in because she was starting to growl in the dark at the foot of my bed. They checked her for night blindness and her hearing then determined that she's just a grumpy old lady. They didn't charge me for the visit like most vets would have.   They've also been very good about keeping me from having to visit. Before I came here I would have to take Lola to the vet at least once a month, but now our visits are few and far between.   The receptionists and nurses are sweet as pie and made me feel very comfortable when I was bawling my eyes out waiting for my dogs surgery to be finished.   Alright so, in the end...I love it here

Seriously, even if you never plan on buying a cookie bouquet for someone...  go into Cookies by Design and buy an "oops cookie". These are cookies that came out a little misshapen and therefore they can't use them. They frost them and sell these gems for one dollar. ONE DOLLAR.   I'm not even joking. Once you eat this cookie, you won't ever want another cookie in your life. Or at least, you will constantly be unsatisfied with other sugar cookies.  I've never ordered a bouquet from them but I've seen a lot on display since I used to come here every single day after school when I was in high school. They always look beautiful and I'm sure they taste even better than the oops cookies do.

I'm kind of a snob when it comes to Mexican food. I was raised on the homemade stuff all my life so generally I don't bother to go to a mexican restaurant. Why would I when I can get much better stuff at home?  Anyways, I was so pleased with Los Dos Molinos mexican food that it's now the place I suggest when our family is celebrating something.  Their stuff is HOT HOT HOT, but if you don't like hot you can let them know and they'll help you find something that isn't spicy. The prices are a little up there but in my opinion its worth it. I imagine that their kitchen is full of Mexican grandmothers...that's how authentic it feels. (Don't tell me otherwise because I really like this fantasy)  Their margaritas are really good too. You can tell it doesn't just come from a mix.   and OH MY GOD THE SOPAPILLAS!!!!    My dad works for a company that inspects the top of gas ranges and he serviced this restaurant and said that it was the cleanest restaurant kitchen he'd ever seen. (Believe me he has some horror stories)  My only problem is that it didn't feel like they had the air on at all. They have ceiling fans but come on...it's 115 outside.

Wow! This place was so great. I've been searching for a way to seal a mural that I inked in permanent marker and then painted with acrylic paint for over a year now. Every place I went sold me things that they promised would work but they all made the marker bleed. Of course they wouldn't take them back either.   I came into Wet Paint and the girl was SO helpful. She didn't look at me like I was retarded because I used markers in the first place and she actually opened up something and tested it on her own piece of art to make sure it wouldn't bleed. I couldn't believe how helpful she was. I was going to buy two big bottles of the sealer but she told me that I would be fine with just one. I really appreciated the honesty.   I will be coming here for all of my future art supplies.

I'd imagine if I were a dog, this dog park would be like the Disneyland of Dog Parks.   They have tons of toys and even pools and water for the dogs to play in when it's getting hot. Public balls and tug toys are scattered about. There are two giant sides, one for active dogs and one for passive dogs. Etiquette here is good. I've never had a problem with another dog or owner here.   That being said, it's just like Disneyland and almost always very crowded. This could be good or bad. I have two dogs, one who gets overwhelmed by crowded places and one who loves the excitement of it. Really it just depends on your dogs personality and what he/she likes.   Also be prepared to see lots of Scottsdale moms with their fluffy dogs in bows and dresses. It's kind of like the Hollywood strip of dog parks.

I'm so happy that FYE still exists. Last time I went I was looking for two pretty obscure movies. Baseketball and Orgazmo. The computer said that they had both but I couldn't find them in the store. Even though they were completely packed because of some stupid Twilight release, the employee walked me through the store looking for where they could be. We found Baseketball on some random end cap and Orgazmo at the bottom of a bin. I never would have been able to find those on my own and considering the fact they were both just really cheap used movies, I appreciated all the extra help.   Whenever I want a DVD that I know I won't be able to find and I just can't wait to order it online, this is my first choice.   The only reason it's getting four instead of five is because the store was slammed and they only had one register open. The line took forever but there was another functioning register so I'm not sure why they didn't have it open. There were more than enough employees.

I'm not a fan of buffets at all, but for Pink Pepper I always make an exception. The food is amazing and even worth the lunch price if you only get one plate!  Dinner is a little expensive but the food is still just as wonderful. The service is nice and the family always recognizes us. Big fan :}   Give them your business!!

What a great restaurant! It has lots of conversational pieces on the walls without being really tacky. The building has a ton of history and it's really interesting. The waitresses are always super sweet. I've never had one that wasn't funny and nice and very attentive.   My family comes here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's rare that a restaurant has great food in all three categories.    The only problem I have is that EVERY single time I ask for something without cheese...it comes with cheese anyways. I'm not one for sending food back so then I'm forced to take medicine and bear a stomachache. Bill Johnsons just really wants me to endure dairy I guess.

Why all the hate? I used to frequent here for lunch all the time. The prices were cheap and the food was always amazing. Every soup on the menu was good and the service was wonderful. I can't imagine giving this place any less than five stars.  This place is never busy. I think every time I've gone I was like...one of the only people in the restaurant.

I like Chick-Fil-A but it's too expensive for fast food. There isn't anything about their food that makes me think a single chicken sandwich should be that price. Their fries need a ton of salt for me to enjoy them. I'd be lying if I said that their chicken wasn't good but I rarely come here unless I have one of those GET A FREE SANDWICH coupons. Otherwise I always feel like I'm getting ripped off.  Also   PS: Chick-Fil-A, being closed on Sunday does not make this Utah. You're still in Arizona where employees usually don't mind working on Sundays and customers get frustrated if a place is closed all day.

I go to the Sallys on Scottsdale road and in Mesa often and have never really had any complaints.   When I came to this location I was with my mother looking for a product to tame my younger brothers wild jewfro. The other Sallys stores suggested multiple products and none of them worked. We were getting kind of desperate and now our bathroom is full of "ethnic-grade" taming product meant for african american hair that didn't work.   The salesgirl here was very helpful and gave us a product that she said worked on her boyfriends jewfro. She explained to us why the african products we bought werent working and then told us that if for any reason the one she suggested didn't work we could bring it back. The other Sallys stores have always told us that there is a no return policy on opened product. We were so thankful!  The best part was that the product DID actually work on his hair!  The store is the same size and carries the same products as any other Sallys but I'll forever hold this one dear in my heart for the return policy and helpfulness of the salespeople.

This place seriously has the most authentic tasting tacos outside of Mexico. In case you don't know (which I'm assuming you don't), a real mexican taco comes in a floppy yet thick delicious corn tortilla shell with meat, cilantro, and onions. They do it PERFECT.  The bean burritos are great but I wouldn't say they're the best. Their salsa is extraordinary. My Poppy is really picky with his salsa because he was raised by a mexican indian mother who made it fresh homemade every morning and he swears that this is the only place he'll buy salsa from. But still, the stars of this show are definitely the tacos, meat, and rice.   Be prepared for service from people who don't speak very much English. They know about enough to take your order politely but don't try to ask too many questions or make conversation. Oh and the menus are totally in Spanish. I promise you the confusion and frustration will be worth it. Learn a couple words. That's the price you pay for authentic Mexican food.   Last time I came here the cashier had her baby with her in a stroller. He was screaming and crying the entire time throwing toys and begging for attention from his busy mother. I probably wouldn't ever want to dine in here. I always do take-out.

This is only place that I'll ever go for my pedicures and manicures. I've had some pretty horrible experiences before but this place is amazing.   The prices are fair and worth it and the people are so nice. I've never had someone actually talk to me while doing my nails/toes before. They actually hold conversation with you and remember you too. I only go about once every five months but they always remember who I am!  I suggest requesting Stephen or Tiffany. They both are very experienced and friendly. Stephen could have charged me a lot for an acrylic nail to replace one of my toenails that had fallen off but he told me that I should just wait for it to grow back and painted it so it looked like I had a nail there. I really appreciated his honesty! There's also another girl who has an accent (but isn't asian) that is very good and I haven't had a chance to get her name.  There are about two people there that have worked on my friends and they were unhappy with it. I think they were new. So just be careful about who you get. Those two are the only reason I didn't give four stars!

I've always been a fan of Claim Jumper. Someone called it Cracker Barrel on steroids and I laughed so hard because that's exactly what you will experience.  Their food is amazing. That isn't an argument at all. Be prepared to have leftovers that will last you until the next rainy season, seriously. The prices are really expensive because you're not buying a meal, you're investing in a series of meals.   My problem the last time I came here was the service. The waitress was kind of rude and kept giving us dirty looks. Then when the food came out my mashed potatoes had gravy on them. The menu didn't say they came with gravy and she never asked me if I wanted gravy. I am physically incapable of eating gravy. Is it just me or is gravy the kind of thing you're supposed to ask if someone wants before just assuming? If it had been on the menu I would have asked for none. I was really sad about this because I love their mashed potatoes.   My mom ordered a piece of chocolate cake the size of a whale. I was both terrified and astounded by this beast. I don't eat chocolate but they all said it was great. I'll have to believe them.  I wish I could pick 3.5 but whatever.

I just don't get it! The burgers are empty with barely any taste, the fries are always cold and leave a disgusting greasy film in my mouth, and the grilled onions taste like slimy slugs.  I want to like this place, I really do. I'm forced to eat it at least once every six months because every single person I know loves it and acts like it's Gods gift to fast food. (hence the psalms on the cups) This place is like fast food for elitists. "I won't step foot into a McDonalds but In&Out is so indie and different that I'll allow them to serve me~"  The hidden menu is what really gets me. Having "secret items" on your menu doesn't make you cool. It doesn't make your customers feel special or exclusive (unless they're idiots). It just makes me feel like you're too cheap to update the menu that you've had since the dawn of time.  Did I mention that there is ALWAYS a giant line? Both in the drive through and the dine in. Theres never a good place to sit and it's always packed. If I didn't know any better I'd think it was Club In&Out.  That being said, when I'm forced to eat it I'm unhappy but never physically ill like I am with another extremely popular place that I hate (chipotle). Also the employees are really friendly and service is pretty quick considering how long the lines always are.   I know I'll most likely continue going here with people close to me for the rest of my life but I would never pick it on my own or suggest it to outsiders.

I love their food. It's probably the best jewish deli food I've had since I left the east coast. (I actually prefer it here)  That being said I have a bias and hatred for New York and I can't stand the NY style atmosphere. That's an unfair bias but take it as it is.  They have the best greek omelet that I've ever had and their pastries are to die for. Everything tastes authentic and I'm willing to deal with the crowds of loud college students just to have their matzo soup and blintzes. Mmmmm.

Just went there yesterday and the guy behind the counter was so helpful and nice. My mom and dad had never had Jewish food before so he explained very politely what was in Knishes and even let us try things that we weren't sure about. Absolutely excellent customer service.  At first I thought that 8 bucks was a little much for take out soup but it was a generous serving and since it was the end of the day they threw in a matzo ball just because. It also came with an entire bag of bagel chips.

I love the World Market! It's the only place where I can find gummi cola and coffeecrisp bars in the same store! Yum!  The holiday season is the best time to visit. They always have bins full of stocking stuffers that range from all sorts of really cute things from all over the world. It's a must hit place for me since I send out a lot of little packages to friends across the US for the holidays.  The only bad experience I had was last year when I was searching for a menorah. I asked if they sold them since I saw they had menorah candles. The guy I asked looked at me like I was from mars and then finally said, "Oh that Hannukah thing?" and rolled his eyes. It was kind of rude! But I haven't seen that employee back there since. Maybe he was seasonal.  A week later I asked the same question to another employee and she was really friendly and helpful.   I hear a lot of people come here for the wine selection. I don't know about that but as far as the candy and toys and cute Christmas ornaments... I'm a fan!

I'm so surprised to see all the bad reviews of this place. The parking could be better but considering the closest alternative is Mill Ave...I'd say the parking is great in comparison.   The idea of an outdoor mall in Arizona sort of bothers me at first. In the summer this place isn't exactly a prime spot but any other season it's perfect. What other outdoor malls do we have? There's Desert Ridge which personally I can't stand. It's full of loud preteens and ridiculous Scottsdale moms. We used to have the Pavillions but may it RIP. The people you find in the Marketplace are a pretty even mixture. You don't see too many college kids or tons of old people. It's equal all around.  I don't mind that everythings spread out. When the weathers nice I enjoy walking around (especially at night with all the lights). During the summer you just drive from one spot to another. It's really not that hard.   As far as the music goes...it's never really bothered me that much unless it's the holidays.  But I think everyone can relate to getting annoyed by hearing ITS THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR, over and over and over again. It's not like they play it that loud anyways unless you're in the parking lot.  Overall I think it's a pretty solid shopping center. During the summer, stick to Fiesta Mall. But if it's nice out, enjoy yourself. It's gorgeous and fun!

I love YC's so my friend suggested that I try Genghis Grill out. We went on a double date and I was less than pleased. First off the recipes were sort of hidden and the line was moving way too fast so I couldn't search for them. Instead I ended up frantically putting on random spices and hoping it would taste good.   The waitress was really rude to us when we asked her questions about the location and restaurant. Since I didn't use an actual recipe my food was kind of gross.  If you want good mongolion go to YCs. If you're in Tempe Marketplace, skip this place and get some Slices or something.

This is like seriously the best Bevmo in the world. I've been to other Bevmos and they don't compare.   The selection is giant (although they DON'T HAVE RASPBERRY GINGERALE! ... I'll forgive them.) Chances are that if you want something related to alcohol, they'll have it. The prices are kind of high but still way cheaper than they would be at some snobby pretentious import liquor store. I like my shopping carts thank you very much!!  I've never had a question go unanswered here. Their employees are very knowledgeable. The only problem I have is that sometimes they don't card me and uh...I seriously look like I'm 14. That worries me greatly since it's so close to the college.

I think I'm seriously missing something here. Am I the only person in the world that thinks Chipotle sucks? There isn't one thing on the menu that I enjoy. Not even the chips and salsa. How can you mess up chips and salsa??  EVERYONE I know loves this place. I feel like I'm an alien. Maybe they put something in their food that not only makes you bleed when you go the bathroom, but also hypnotizes you to think they have the best food when really its the worst.  My two most recent experiences are as follows:  A friend of mine insisted we go before a movie. I asked him if he really wanted to eat that garbage and then sit for two hours but he said yes. I watched him eat a burrito while I ate stale chips and the cashier made fun of me (YES HE MADE FUN OF ME! WHO DOES THIS?) for not ordering something. He actually asked me if I was watching my figure. I'm a skinny girl so it was really insulting to the bigger girls behind me in line. I could tell they were visibly offended.  Another time my boyfriend got a coupon for a free burrito for selling his books back to the school. I guess they figure that if you're stupid enough to sell your books back to the school instead of online then you're stupid enough to eat Chipotle. I went with him even if I didn't want anything. I just wanted to spend time with him. Well apparently everyone and their mother wanted Chipotle that day because the line was so long it went outside. The door was open so it was hot. Imagine every possible thing that could go wrong in a line happening at once. That's what it was. Sweaty people all over, screaming kids, crying babies, loud cell phone talkers, cutters.... Ugh. When we finally reached the front of the human labyrinth they almost didn't take his coupon even though it was completely valid.     In the end. Not a fan of the food, the experience, the staff, the building. No. Please someone tell me what I'm missing here!!

I honestly think that I'm like one of the only straight girls in the world who likes this place. I love the sports bar atmosphere and their food is really good. I used to order the take-out wings all the time back in the day.  The waitresses are always really nice. I went to a Hooters in California once and our waitress was so rude. You could tell she was a frustrated and annoyed failed actress and was taking it out on her customers. The girls who work at this location are mostly college girls and don't have a bad attitude.   The last time I came here was with my family for my little brothers 13th birthday. The waitress was really nice and attentive. When we asked her if the fried pickles were good (since we hadn't been in years) she said, "If you like pickles the fried pickles are good."  It was the silliest response ever and she instantly realized it and laughed with us. It was just a pleasant atmosphere in general.  They took my brother to the front and made him stand on a chair with balloons stuffed in his shirt while the girls sing him happy birthday. It was really nice of them to go above and beyond the average ice cream with a birthday song. They also gave him a calendar that all the waitresses signed for him.  I have this theory that the only people who don't like Hooters are jealous girls and/or men who would rather be at strip club but their wives won't let them go.  Could have done without the upstairs location though. I'd imagine after having a few drinks it would suck to get out. (Maybe thats the point!)

My parents love this place. They ranted and raved about how great it was so when my mom invited me to go there for a girls night, I was happy to try it out.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Fake trees covered in lights...the whole nine yards. I hear they have live music on the weekends. The stage was beautiful.  Everything was pretty expensive but I don't mind spending $15 on a meal if it's worth it. I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and a margarita.   The margarita was alright. Nothing too special. Definitely not a twelve dollar margarita. As for the food, well it was horrible. My enchilada had cinnamon on it. CINNAMON. It didn't say that it would have cinnamon on the menu. I HATE cinnamon. I was really polite about it when I mentioned it to the waitress and she said, "Well AUTHENTIC mexican food usually has cinnamon on the main dishes."  Excuse me? My last name is Montoya and I was running around in diapers eating fresh tortillas before this waitress was even born. My family visits Mexico multiple times a year and I was raised on homemade mexican food. Not once EVER has there been cinnamon in it. I wouldn't have been mad about the cinnamon if she hadn't said that. It is NOT authentic mexican food. I have no idea what she was thinking.  If you like overpriced 'mexican' food that tastes nothing like mexican food and love dessert spices on your enchiladas, then I'd suggest coming here!  Stick to the bar for the atmosphere because it's lovely but avoid the food at all costs.

Jersey Mikes has GREAT subs but still isn't a replacement for Subway.   While I love their turkey sub, they don't have a very wide variety of sandwich toppings and I don't like their tuna. (I need black olives and spinach! Maybe I'm just spoiled.)  I'll come here for a turkey sub but if I feel like tuna I'll stick to subway.  When I came with my cousin she ordered a sub with nothing but mayo and lettuce on it and after some laughter the guy behind the counter refused to let her pay for such a measly sandwich. When she ordered the same thing at Subway they charged her for a veggie anyways. It was pretty cool of him.

I searched forever to find someone to help me. The store wasn't even that busy! All I had was a very simple question, "Where are your tablets located?"  That was it! Nobody would help me. I felt like I was a leper.  I came again yesterday with my sixteen year old cousin to pick up a cord for my ipod and the employees at the front literally cat called to us. It was beyond unprofessional.  The people at checkout are always friendly (maybe a little too friendly) I wonder if I can ever go to Best Buy without being sexually harassed.  But after working there my teenage years, I've come to believe that it won't ever change.

Another really popular place I just don't understand. It was crowded and the service wasn't that great. My grape leaves tasted like rubber and had tomatoes in them even though I asked for none.  The hummus tasted like it was made from powder and the pitas were hard.

With the internet as big as it is now, how is Gamestop still even in business? If you want to get ripped off on your trades/purchases on new/used games then go ahead and come here. It's Scottsdale! Anything goes!

I'm not even a big fan of sports and this is easily my favorite bar. The prices are really cheap for a bar and the food is good considering it's just bar food. They have daily specials including a day where you can get a two dollar hamburger with fries. This means its a real hamburger, not a tiny little thing. My mom and I can share it.   Pool, Shuffleboard and Darts are available as well as other games. Electronic cards and racing. The service is always amazing even if theyre very busy. I've never had a bad waitress here.   The best part is that they have a giant private room and guess how much it is to rent it out? It's completely free. You just have to book it in advance. They could have easily charged a lot for that private room since it includes its own shuffleboard and pool table.   Also they have a FREE designated driver who will take you home. All they ask is that you tip them. There's no reason to ever go anywhere else.

I live near here and have watched this space turn into a different restaurant every four or so years. It's an unfortunate place for a semi-fancy eatery to be. It's squeezed in between Food City and Big Lots which are big places for lower income shoppers. I doubt they ever get any walk-by customers.   It was really nice inside. I love what they did with the place. It felt very authentic and honestly I was suprised when I walked in because it was so big and decorative on the inside but the outside is kind of plain.  Anyways, the food was great. The waitress was real polite with my boyfriend whos new to indian food and explained to him the levels of spicy and what came in what. They had complementary appetizers and the portions were very large.   The vegetarian selection was great. As a part time vegetarian I can always appreciate a place that has meals without meat that actually fill you up.   By the way they were playing indian music. Not the classical stuff but newer pop music that you might hear actual indian people listening to. I don't care how cheesy it sounds but that alone won me over.

Ruby Tuesdays is stuck in a tragic location in my opinion. It's right next to Red Robin which is my all time favorite American chain. So naturally I never go there since I'd much rather have Red Robin. I'm glad my parents convinced me to come with them though.  Everybody was satisfied with their meal and their salad bar looked very fresh. My grandfather took part in it and each time he came back I was surprised at the abundance of things he managed to find there.   My meal was smoked salmon with broccoli and there weren't any complains there. The server was polite and attentive. Honestly I don't have any complaints. The prices were a little higher than I'd expected but well worth it. The atmosphere was nice and quiet and relaxed. I can always appreciate that.   Great place for a classy simple American meal.

Finally a Paradise Bakery near me! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for them anymore! No longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because I hate real cake!   Right?  Wrong. This Paradise Bakery just plain sucks. I still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but I would never eat their food. I've tried eating here twice. Once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). The second time was just pasta salad. How do you mess up pasta salad? TELL ME. Another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. How does that even happen? Are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup?  This location is always packed. I've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. That and the employees (besides ONE old lady who works there) are total jerks. I'm serious. Dude you work at Paradise Bakery for a living. Don't talk down to me when I'm trying to order a cookie.   I only come here to get my Mr Pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. Their cookies are just as good as any other Paradise. I have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees.

I heard someone call Applebees the Walmart of restaurants and I couldn't agree more.   Everybody assumes I would love this place because it has apple in the name and I really like apple themed things. But no. Ugh. Gross. Nothing on the menu is good and the prices aren't even cheap!! I can understand cheap prices for cheap food but the prices are the same as Chilis or TGI Fridays. Except they have good food.  The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever come here is because my boyfriends parents love it. No idea why.

The owners of this store are truly businessmen that I would trust.   On top of the wonderful products they always have, they also offer great advice when decorating your home.  I recommend their business to anyone. At least stop by and check out what they have to offer.

My family loves this place. The food is amazing and you can pretty much create anything you want if you order it right.  Mac and cheese w/feta cheese spinach and olives? YES PLEASE  Also their loosemeat sandwiches are to DIE for. I never thought I'd find one here in Arizona!  The staff is always very friendly. Bar is a little pricey but that's to be expected.I've never gone and had it be too busy and my family says they have the best pies around (I don't like sweet stuff).  I hear theres a lot of drama going on about the owner and his employees. Hopefully they get that all fixed up because the food is amazing and it would be a shame to lose this restaurant.

This rating is based on the sushi alone. My boyfriend ate the cooked food but I was really just in the mood for sushi that night.   Basically they have a sushi guy there making sushi nonstop at random. I was completely satisfied with the variety and the taste. Very delicious! The price is right too. All you can eat sushi is hard to come across. Yum yum!  As far as the buffet and cooked food went there was a huge variety but my boyfriend said it was just standard buffet food. I'll come here again just for the sushi :}

Maggies Pita Palace has the best hummus in the state. It's always fresh and tastes amazing. They cook the pitas right in front of you. The prices are fair and the staff is really friendly. They always remember me and exactly what I want.   Not just their hummus but their greek salads and falafels are wonderful too. The portions are big enough that me and my boyfriend (who likes to eat) can share a platter and both be satisfied.   Give them your business!! Why rot in a jungle when you can relax in a palace? ;}  THIS is how Greek and Mediterranean food should be done!

I feel like I went to a completely different place than other reviewers. Perhaps it was just an off day but I won't risk it again.  First off the air wasn't working and it was summer. The place was packed with loud children screaming everywhere and the server didn't refill our drinks once.   That alone would have been okay if the food was good but it wasn't. While there was a wide variety of it...nothing was actually good. Most of it was cold and looked like it had been sitting out forever even though it was the middle of lunch. After one tiny plate my boyfriend and I paid and left because it just wasn't worth staying.
