I. love. this. restaurant.  Seriously.  When my wife and I were first dating she asked me to surprise her for dinner. Her one condition for this date was that they needed to have good bread. Two restaurants ran through my head: Texas Roadhouse and Olive Garden.  My wife is Italian and at the time I didn't know about her fiery distain for Olive Garden. Boy am I glad that I chose Texas Roadhouse.  The first thing served is a basket of hot, fresh-baked bread with some of the best cinnamon butter ever. After that bread basket everything else was just additional. My wife and I split the Filet Medallions (a regular dish that we order now) with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. Heaven on earth.

My favorite place to eat in Tempe!  The atmosphere is always perfect; not too loud, but still noisy enough with the good music to be enjoyable. I love the rotating art collection, because it gives me something new to look at every time I come.  The food is so good. I've only ever had one thing that I didn't like (the chicken pasta salad), but It's been a 10 for me every other time. The Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza is my favorite dish with the Fruit Fantasia at a close second.

I love this restaurant.  The above statement comes easily and without any sort of hesitation.  Their pizzas are phenomenal, the appetizers are great, the wait staff is very helpful, and the ambiance is great.  After looking at my budget, I noticed that my only expense for the last two months in my restaurants category is LGO.  Seriously, go there, order the artichoke appetizer, iced tea, a margarita pizza, and gelato to finish it off. Amazing!

I honestly don't know if the previous reviewers have actually ever tasted proper Chinese food, but this place is disgusting. My wife and I came here solely on recommendations from Yelp! We have never been steered wrong before but I think the reviewers of this establishment have NO idea what they are talking about.  Not only was everything slathered in grease and corn syrup (if you've cut High Fructose Corn Syrup out of your diet you will know exactly what I mean), but it was either overcooked or completely devoid of anything edible. I tried a little bit of everything to make sure it wasn't just one dish, but everything was consistently terrible.  Their teriyaki chicken had nothing but sugar-coated skin and fat in the pieces served (Gross!!!)  Everything was bland and had no flavor other than the horribly sweet sauces they poured on everything. The sushi bar was adequate for an all-you-can-eat establishment, but that did not save the $13/person meal (not including drinks) that we unfortunately had to pay for.   I also have to say that basing a restaurant's overall rating on that amount of seating available is just absurd. If I'm going to shell out my hard-earned money I could care less if there are lots of booths to sit at. The food needs to be good and anyone who considers this food anywhere close to enjoyable should have their Yelp! accounts deactivated (if that's possible).  DO NOT GO HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY! There's a YCs Mongolian Grill down the street if you want decent food.

I can't tell you how much I appreciate this business. The owner and staff are extremely helpful, they are pleasant and down-to-earth, they know their trade well, and I have never felt pressured to do something that I didn't need to.  I regularly visit them for my auto maintenance from oil changes to more heavy stuff. I had the stupid idea to visit a dealership to get my services done and felt completely ripped off. After visiting the C&R the next day, they went through leaps and bounds to make sure my car was road-ready...far better than a certain Toyota dealership near Mesa Riverview.  I can't recommend them enough. Great prices, honest staff, and the willingness to go the extra mile makes me a happy customer.

This location scares the bejesus out of me. There's always armed policeman patrolling the store, the lights are dim, and for some reasons it always smells when I walk in.  The clientele don't help either, but that has nothing to do with the store...just its proximity to a particularly poor part of town.

This location is always clean, well-stocked, and the gentleman with the British accent is so nice! My wife and I are both in school, so finding the best prices for healthy food was terribly difficult before we discovered Fresh & Easy.  The staff in this store is awesome! They are always very friendly and they have coupons on hand just in case I forget mine. It seems silly because it's usually only a couple of bucks, but it makes us feel like they are looking out for our budget.  We both love to cook, so getting the freshest ingredients is important to us. We love the small, cozy atmosphere of the stores and how easy it is to find what we are looking for. Your deals on meat, cheese, and breads are awesome and your fruit section has become my favorite place in the store.  The only complaint that I have about this location is that it's a bit difficult to get into because of it's placement near the intersection. That con in not nearly enough to dissuade me from shopping here because everything else has been fantastic.

Perfect street tacos. I couldn't stop ordering them.  The carnitas, el pastor, and carne asada tacos were awesome, tender and crispy.  Pretty easy to find and I had no problem conversing in English (although I chose to practice the small amount of Spanish I know).  Totally worth the drive.

This is a great business. I've always had good service and its really affordable.  Three tiers: $5 - Basic wash $8 - A little bit better $10 - Full clean with tires, spotless, and wax  Plus, unlimited vacuum usage. Sweet.

Chipotle is definitely one of my favorite quick meal establishments, but this location always seems to make everything far too spicy. I don't know if they are putting too much seasoning on or what, but I've come out of here gasping on some occasions.  I do also agree with Bryan S. that the employees are of a lower caliber than usual and the servings sizes are all wrong. I've never come out of a Chipotle hungry until I started visiting this location.

Unfortunately I did not have the best experience at this location. Let me first say that my wife and I are HUGE Fresh & Easy fans and have been avidly shopping at the chain for over three years now. A majority of our grocery budget goes to these stores because of their fantastic selection, prices, and amount of healthier products (no added hormones, coloring, HFCS, etc.).  My wife and I used to visit the Tempe location religiously when we both had apartments near Arizona State, but since we've moved in together at our new place in Phoenix this is the most convenient location because of its proximity to work and home. I don't know what the difference is between the two other than location, but every time we have gone into the Phoenix location we have always dealt with very grumpy employees. We usually write off the experience because we are happy enough to be shopping in our favorite store, but the caliber of employee interaction is FAR better at the Kyrene & Baseline location than here. Our interaction with the employees the other night is what finally pushed me over the edge to write a review.  My wife and I are both students and I work all day, so most of our shopping is done at night. We went to this location as usual to pick up our weekly supply of groceries. When we reached checkout I brought out my coupon which I receive from the e-newsletter and proceeded to scan it. I have been told on many occasions from employees at that location to try and scan the coupon multiple time to make sure I get the best savings. Since there is no condition on the coupon itself that says we can't use it more than once on a transaction and we spend over $120 per trip it has always been nice to save $20 here and there (it's actually one of the reasons we stopped going to Fry's and Safeway).   I was confronted by a very rude Justin Bieber look-a-like who bluntly told me that we weren't allowed to do that. This was a bit puzzling because we had done it before, so I had mentioned that it makes no sense. In a rude, sarcastic tone he told me that "Actually, it makes perfect sense", meanwhile not actually talking to me but walking around with his head down tending to other things, as he moved on while completely disregarding my issue. The Tempe location knew who my wife and I were when we would come in, greet us by name, and even had an extra coupon in case we forgot ours. I understand that your company is trying not to give money away, but as a customer for quite some time now, saving a few bucks on our $150 grocery stop really isn't putting you out of business. Not only that but I have said nothing but good things to everyone I know in order to gain your stores more business.  When he awkwardly asked us if we wanted to speak with a manager he got on his radio and asked if they accept more than one coupon per transaction. He held up his radio and turned the volume up as some disembodied voice called out "No!". That was it. No customer-facing help, no compromise for regular customers, he didn't even look at me while he was talking.  This experience will not keep me from visiting Fresh & Easy stores, but I won't shop at this location again. This may seem like a pretty trivial matter, but the employees at this store need to learn some customer experience skills. I will be posting a positive review for the store in Tempe, since I have never had a bad experience there.

This is a really awesome UO!  The store is clean, well-stocked, and huge. The staff was really helpful and friendly, the sale section had some awesome deals ($50 button-up shirt for $20...just saying), and I love the little books and toys.  I think once City Scape gets filled out a little more it will be a great place to go on a regular basis since its right near the light rail.

I have to first say that I have eaten at Coal Burger before and my first experience was a good one.  Since my last visit, probably over a year ago, I have become a Pescatarian. It has been just over 7 months since I've eaten a burger and one night I really had a hankering. I appreciate Coal Burger's grass-fed beef and healthy options, but unfortunately it didn't save my last trip to the restaurant.  My wife and I went in late at night about an hour-and-a-half before they closed to order a grass-fed burger; My wife ended up going with the vegetarian since she doesn't eat meat at all. The first experience at the register was getting incorrectly charged by the cashier. I figured that since it was late, there really wasn't any reason for me to throw a fit. I ordered my burger medium-rare with fries.  What came out was a completely well-done burger and cold French fries. On top of that, my wife's vegetarian burger was burnt and dry. I sent my burger back to have them cook up another one which came back the same, dry and burnt. On top of that, the buns were cold and untoasted, my vegetables were limp, and the soda was way too sweet.  For a company whose claim to fame is their grass-fed beef, they sure know how to over cook it. If their cook paid half as much attention to my food as he was the cute waitresses, we might not have had such a lousy experience.  It's a shame that the food quality has degraded over time...  I will say that the manager did reach out to me and offer another burger. At that point, with a pound of meat already ruined, I decided against another burger and requested a refund. She did give me a refund which I appreciated, but I went home hungry and frustrated with a business that I once enjoyed.  I can easily say that this will probably be my last time to Coal Burger unless something drastic changes to raise the quality of the meal.

Meh  I can imagine going here for the game, but breakfast with family is bit exhausting. First off, if your into watching tv during your meals, then you'll enjoy this place. I'm a bit old-fashioned because I like to talk my family during breakfast; that's pretty difficult with the sports blasting everywhere.   The service is hit-or-miss. We've had one guy who's a really great server and another who seems like special requests annoy the bejesus out of him.   Food. It's ok. I don't think I've had a single thing over the several times we've been there that has made me say, "that was really good".   Overall, it's a mediocre brunch experience that leaves much to be desired.
