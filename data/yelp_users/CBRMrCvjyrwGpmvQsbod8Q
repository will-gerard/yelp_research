I visited the Deja Vu Adult Emporium, last Sunday on a weekend get-a-way with my boyfriend. I was so surprised at how big the store was and how busy it was so late at night. We walked in and immediately headed to the the sex toy area, where we were greeted by a lovely girl named CARSUN. she provided a great atmosphere for us to indulge in splurging on a toy that I have had my eye on for a while. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. I highly recommend this store  cant wait to go back on our next visit and buy another toy!!!

By far the best barbecue joint in Phoenix. My family has been coming here for years ever since I was in a high chair. Every time me or one of my friends has a hankering for barbecue, we make the drive to mesa for waldos. I highly recommend this place, you wont be sorry! Don't forget to try the cornbread or the horsey potatoes! (mashed potatoes with horseradish )

this is a pleasant joint tucked behind Saks 5th Ave, the atmosphere is perfect for a work meeting or casual lunch with old girlfriends. I had the House Smoked Salmon with Cr√®me Fraiche on an Edible Spoon, with a glass of Chardonnay. it was a fresh dish with a nice light taste of salmon. the edible spoon wasn't my favorite idea. it tasted like a slightly saltier communion wafer.   the best part of my experience was the staff, the manager sat down with me at the bar and we chatted over what wines we liked with salmon and the bartender  Josh had a very calming attitude and made me feel very welcome as i sat alone. The chef came out and chatted with me about his experiences and other low key restaurants he enjoyed in the area.  I would recommend this place for anyone, alone or in a group

for the area and the price of each item I expected a lot more. this was a second choice for me because the Wright Restaurant didn't open until after 5, i ordered the short rib mac and cheese and it was nothing less then short, there was no taste to it at all, i had to add hot sauce just to get flavor an di am not even a fan of hot sauce,  i would say to avoid this joint, Denny's would be better

The name says it all, culinary dropout, food and service both worthy of expulsion.   I have never been so disappointed or disrespected in a restaurant as I was at culinary dropout.  I placed an order for pickup and when I arrived, the food was sitting by the cash register at the bar in the open. It wasn't under a heat lamp or in anything to keep it warm, I even made a comment to the rude bartender who wanted to finish drying his wine glasses before approaching me asking why the food wasn't being kept warm and that it would be cold before getting home and his response was that it was warm. Then he printed out the check and all he said was "cheers!"   I ordered the steak, fish and chips and soft pretzel, all of which were cold and soggy, the steak was already cut up and half of it was fat. Not just marbled with fat, pure  yellow fat! The fries were soggy, fondue dipping sauce was solidified, fish and chips were cold and limp.   Giving the restaurant one star is generous, they can bet their bottom dollar I won't be returning,

The best way to describe Blanco Tacos without the risk of insult is to say it is a white boys Mexican restaurant. The food was lacking in flavor and very dry. We started with the Nachos con queso with short ribs, and the meat was tasty, but everything was wrong. There was no sauce on it only black beans, chunks of bland cheese pretending to be crema fresca, and a few cubes of avocados.   Two minutes after the Nachos arrived our entrees were delivered. I ordered the tacos believing if it's in the name of the restaurant they must be good, boy was I wrong. I ordered two traditional carnitas tacos, and one crispy shrimp taco. I had to doctor up both versions by adding tomatillo salsa and limes. The carnitas was very bland and lukewarm. Rubio's had a much better discontinued carnitas taco. The crispy shrimp taco wasn't crispy at all, it tasted like reheated frozen shrimp you buy at a grocery store. It came with pickled onions and Fresno chili, both flavorless. And sadly on the way home the shrimp wanted one last chance at freedom and erupted all over the side of the road.   My boyfriend ordered the Green Chili Pork burrito enchilada style (smothered in green sauce, which oddly enough wasn't even green) he wasn't impressed at all with the overall appearance/taste/experience. Not to mention, the rice is actually a sweet corn rice mix which they failed to list on the menu, and the Charro beans tasted like dirt.   I gave them One last chance to seduce me by ordering the sopapillas with local honey. Sadly, they were dense and stacked like a dessert jenga, so you have to use your fingers to catch them as they topple over with every try.   In my opinion I would bypass this restaurant and go to Filibertos, it's honestly much more of a decent Mexican restaurant then Blancos will ever be.

We went to Pink Pony last night for my birthday dinner, made a reservation for 8pm and told them we were celebrating a birthday. I loved the food at Pink Pony, by far the best fillet I have ever had, it was a juicy thick slab of meat that cut like butter and melted in your mouth. The fillet was perfectly seasoned and cooked.   The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bartender Ashley. We were sat in her section of the bar in a booth. When she came over I asked about wines and asked to try a few before making my decision since they were out of my usual choice, and she seemed quite annoyed with having to serve a drink as bartenders do. Then halfway through the appetizer she was too busy drying wine glasses that my date had to go up to the bar and order another drink. She forgot part of my meal because she admittedly "grabbed it to fast before making sure it was done". So, throughout all of dinner she only came to the table a total of 3 times start to finish.   Then there was a group in the back of the restaurant singing along to the radio  loudly and out of tune. You would think adults would be better behaved in a nice expensive restaurant. They along with Ashley put a damper on my birthday dinner.   In my opinion if I am spending over $100 on dinner for two, I better get $100 dollar service. Luckily we had a coupon for 25% off orherwise it wouldn't have been worth the bad service, to say the least the food was Pink Ponys saving grace. I would recommend trying this place but do not sit in Ashley's section.   Also don't go for a birthday celebration expecting a song or a free dessert. They wouldn't dare charge $50/person and give away a $6 piece of cake.
