I loved this place. I went alone one day while doing some house searching in downtown Phoenix. I just picked this place randomly not knowing it'd be so yummy! I ordered the salad with chicken, strawberries and panko-crusted goat cheese. It was SO delicious! I ate every bit of it. The chicken was so tender and moist...and sometimes grilled chicken can be quite dry. Not here. The portion size was more than enough for me and the service was great. It was a such a lovely day to boot. I definitely will go back.

Very cozy little place. Good service and fairly good food for a good price. And you get to shop Vintage clothing afterwards! My Mom adores this place, I take her here on Sundays for lunch sometimes, it always makes her day. :) Which makes mine!

Oh CherryBlossom, where have you been my whole life!?? Discovered this spot by looking for restaurants nearby my workplace. Checked it out online, seemed decent enough. Loved the feeling upon walking, very "homely" an authentic. I was confused by the italian/asian menu, but intrigued as well. Should I mentioned I've been 3 times since I first went there only 1 week ago? I've ordered their bento box (which changes daily), a steal at only $10! I've had their sushi twice. Everything is very cheap and VERY tasty. Servers are very friendly and pretty quick. In and out in 45 minutes during lunch. I think I will be frequenting this place very often.

Went in for an oil change, to get my tires rotated, and to see if I needed new brake pads since they've been squeaking lately. From the moment I walked in, service was quick and very friendly. Everyone seemed eager to help. There was a little bit of a wait, but I did go on a Friday just a few hours before they closed. Still, even with the number of customers they had, I didn't have to wait a very long time. Their prices were very reasonable and the service was professional and fast. They were able to fix my brake pads, which luckily was a super minor issue. They didn't try to badger me or sell me on more things, as auto repair places tend to do. They were very honest, gave me some advice about my vehicle, and sent me on my way. Overall a really pleasant, easy experience. I'd definitely go back.

I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me.

This place is literally 2 miles from my house, I see it almost everyday. Well, finally after months of it teasing me, my boyfriend surprised me and took me here for my birthday last night. I absolutely loved it! I must admit, I'm a sucker for small, cozy restaurants. So that was an already added bonus.  We started the night off with Escargot, which I have never had. I gotta say, it's worth trying. Very unique...tasted unlike anything I've ever had. For our entrees I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the Lobster Risotto. My lamb was so tender! It came out nice and warm paired with couscous. Extremely flavorful! The lobster risotto was yummy too. Very cheesy. Risotto can be tough to make just right, but theirs was perfect.  We finished it off with their chocolate tart. Chocolate ganache topped with whipped cream and toasted hazelnuts, it was the perfect ending of a perfect evening. Service was great and the ambience was low-key and cozy. Definitely a great date spot.  Oh, this is a BYOB restaurant which unfortunately we did not know. The do charge a $9 uncorking fee, but it's cool to sip on your own wine during dinner.  Great spot. Expect to end up with about a $90 bill for 2 people though.

My first time here. We went for Father's Day. The food was good and plentiful, none of us could  finish our meal! But this place gets 2 stars for the service and experience. I was there for 5 minutes and our server spilled a huge cup of water all over my dress. I was soaked, embarrassed, and cold. An accident, yes, but she's (and I) lucky it was just water. Even more so, lucky I had just put my phone and away and moved my dad's present. My dress would've been ruined. When we told the manager at the end of our meal, she just said "oh, I'm sorry." Really? Just sorry? No compensation? I sat here soaking with wet underwear until I dried and you're sorry? LOL. A GOOD manager would've immediately offered something - anything! On top of that, I think our server was deaf. Seemed to ignore us half the time. Again, food was decent but the manager's reaction sealed the deal on my choice to return. You suck, lady.

I prefer the quality of AlphaGraphics over Kinkos for a printer when you're in a hurry, but wtf are people talking about with the "stellar customer service"? I went there today and everyone looked like they'd rather be dead than at work. An older woman barely helped me. At least at Kinkos they do everything for you. I have never been to a print store that required you to figure shit out on your own. She pointed to a computer (an old one at that) and I had to figure out which printer to send it to and how to adjust the settings to fit what I was trying to print. I am very computer savvy, but it just seemed lazy of them/her. She kept walking away and I kept hollering across the entire fucking store asking questions. Seriously!? Just take my thumb drive, plug it in, print the files, and be done with it. Isn't that so much easier than me bugging you 10 times? It's one thing if I request a self-service setup, but I didn't. I was just very unimpressed. No one was particularly mean or rude, just not the least bit happy or helpful. It's frustrating and I'd rather go to Kinkos.  I big MEH from me

Holy sweet tiny baby Jesus wrapped in swaddling clothes, this was one good-ass breakfast joint. I had their crab omelet... O_o it was fabulous! One of those "I feel so full but I will continue to eat this" type moments. You keep shoveling it in, pausing briefly for digestion, then shovel more in so you can finish it. I admittedly fell into a food coma about 3 hours later, but soo worth it. I really enjoyed their food and everyone else's food that I sampled from while they weren't looking. My only complaint was that it was ridiculously freezing in there, but no matter. My chattering teeth made it easier for me to eat faster.

This was only my second Yelp Elite event. Once again, I have nothing but amazing things to say. Dining at the cozy Capital Grille on a sunny afternoon was just delightful. The food was delicious, the staff attentive, the lemonade was perfect! I love my little grab bag and box of truffle chocolate goodness. I brought my friend with me and she praised Yelp and Capital Grille up and down. I can't wait to go back and make use of my free drink coupon!

Picked up my new imac today. Everyone is just super friendly and upbeat. I love good customer service. I did have to wait a bit, but everyone is just so nice I really didn't mind! Plus, I got to chat while I waited with Quinton who was sexy (and he knows it). I'm just sayin'. He carried my computer to my car for me and wished me a very genuine happy christmas. Very pleasant experience with every employee I encountered. I love those nerds!

I've lived here my whole life (28 years, dude) and strangely enough have never been to this place. Well, I finally went here last night with my sexy-pants boyfriend. His pants are sexy.  So, it takes a few minutes to get to the actual restaurant. You drive higher and higher and higher and then directly into outer space. Finally, when you arrive to the top, complimentary valet is waiting for you. Which I zipped right past because I refuse to valet my expensive 2011 standard Golf. I probably should've valeted though, because then I was forced to walk up a slanted hill in 6" heels and had to cling to sexy-pants boyfriend like an old lady with brittle bones. Once inside, you then go up yet another flight of stairs (don't worry, there's an elevator) where you are finally greeted by the hostess. The restaurant itself is interesting - large, glass windows so you can enjoy the view, said Captain Obvious. Aside from that, it's rather plain and even on the drab side. I'm not saying that's a negative. It could be purposeful to not retract from the view? I dunno. The view is seriously spectacular though! I love the desert and this only amplified my love for it. I know there's a lot of haters in Phoenix who talk shit about how ugly this city is. You shut your damn mouth. If you're one of these haters, I encourage you to visit places like this that give you a profound appreciation of how neat mountains and clear skies really are.  Onto the food: Pretty good! Expensive, as one would expect, but not outrageous. I ordered a "micro greens" salad with pistachios, pears, and some type of cheese I'd never heard of it. The salad was truly micro and was almost deconstructed, which I'm not a fan of. I'm lazy and don't want to put my food together. It came out on an overly-HUGE plate and I nearly guffawed at it! Hahaha! It looked really silly and even tinier. Overall though it was pretty good. I also had a side of fingerling potatoes and those were GREAT! S.P. Boyfriend had the chef's special, which was shrimp with kidney beans (I think, can't remember). It was very tasty. We followed all of that up with the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake - definitely the highlight of the evening. The entire bill came to $76 - not bad! Afterward we went outside to check out the rest of the restaurant and made the treacherous trek back down to my baller car, where my boyfriend literally piggybacked me so I didn't have to break my ankles.  Overall, pretty cool place! Friendly staff, great views. Clearly I have run out of things to say.

I've been to this bar multiple times. And I have to admit, it's a smashing good time - every time. I brought my black and Mexican girlfriends here and they were like, "oooh my God we're so out of place." But honestly, they weren't. Yeah it's in Scottsdale. But the patrons are nothing like the typical folk around those parts. They're out to have a damned good time. From the girls swinging from the rafters to the awesome Bad Boys 2 quotes (move bitch!), you can't NOT have a good time here. By the end of the night, my friends had changed their tone about the seemingly white trash bar. Ok ok, it's still a bit white trashy, but whatever. It's FUN white trashy. And I'm white so I can say that. shhh.  Expect to leave drunk and satisfied.

Ok, I'm a bit delayed in this review. But give a girl a break. I'm super busy yo! Anyway, I went here on a Saturday about 3 weeks ago. My bosses generously footed the bill for an ENTIRE SPA DAY as a holiday gift for myself and the only other female that works in our office. We gladly accepted this fantastical gift and scheduled our all-encompassing spa day a few months later.  Upon arriving, I naturally chose to valet. Because I'm stubborn as Hell. And my car is dirty. I parked waaay in back with all the other mediocre vehicles and hoofed it to the spa. Yeah, it's a trek! But a beautiful one. I greeted my fellow female coworkers and we anxiously sat in the main entrance/lounge area awaiting our turn for the aerial yoga.  The Aerial Yoga So, for me, this was the highlight of the day. The class is very small and the teacher takes you through all the appropriate steps of how to be a successful yoga aerialist. It seems intimidating at first, but if you just pay attention and take your time, it's easy enough. More importantly, I got to hang upside down like a damn bat and say "I am DRACULA (rolled R)." At some point, we split into groups of three and flew like freaking Superman! Being the obnoxious person that I am, my goal was to get as high as possible. To be honest I scared myself a little. The class was fully enjoyable except for one thing - which knocked off that coveted 5th star for me - there was a comment made during the class that kinda rubbed me the wrong way. One of the people in the class said, "next we'll be doing pole dancing classes!" and the white snooty Scottsdale teacher said, "oh no, that's a different part of town." Oh, you mean the part of town I live in? Alrighty then. Whatever, it's all good. Keep livin' up to that Scottsdale milk-toast white lady stereotype sister.  The locker rooms / lounging / pool / lunch After the yoga, we basically did nothing but sit around until our lunch was delivered. It was hard for me to accept this since I am NOT a spa person and had a lot of work waiting for me back home, but eventually I was able to shut it down mentally and just enjoy the day. We got a tour of the whole facility, which is really lovely. You get your own little locker, a giant robe, and some sandals that kind of look like Crocs. I opted for my own flip flops. They have 2 saunas (one that's all steamy? I dunno), a waterfall spa, a hot + cold spa, and a bunch of free stuff that poor people like myself find really amazing. I kept putting on free lotion, just 'cause it was free. At one point I was blowdrying my hair and putting on fancy deodorant for no real reason. If I had a mustache, I would've twirled it and laughed like a rich person. I threw on my Gameboy one-piece swimsuit and we headed upstairs to enjoy our delicious lunch by the beautiful pool. Damn Phoenix weather, why you so good to us?  After lunch, we basically just did more lounging. I attempted to use the sauna but felt really suffocated and was like, "you guys I don't think saunas are for me" and decided to do handstands in the jacuzzi instead. Totally fitting in at this point.  The massage HOLY RELAXATION BATMAN. I haven't had a massage in years, maybe only like 5 in my entire life. I got a 90 minute full-body massage and it was GLORIOUS. The masseuse was really good and I think I drooled at some point. Sorry about that. She questioned why I didn't get massages more often and I was like umm because money? I suppose I could afford at least one a year or something, but I would just rather spend my money on art supplies and make my boyfriend do it for free y'know?  The end I was basically a slug at this point. Just dragging my limbs around like a wavy wacky inflatable tube man. I sleepily said goodbye to my girly girlfriends and drove home. Where I felt like accomplishing aboslutely nothing for the rest of the day.  The service is impeccable by the way! I don't like people waiting on me hand and foot, so I probably thanked everyone way too much. But people seemed genuinely happy to be there.

The great thing about this location is the fact that it's near ASU, so a lot of stylish things come through here. The bad part is, everything is slightly more expensive than the one on Missouri and 7th St. I frequent both locations very often and I always get way better bargains at the one in Central Phx. This one does have a better and bigger clothing selection, but the one in Phoenix has a better shoe selection in my opinion. It's good to go to both often really.  My favorite thing about this spot? The sexy, sexy man who works the counter with the bull-ring piercing. I had a difficult time not staring. Whoa! I'm just saying.

Honestly, I don't care for the ambience of this place at all. It's always WAY too noisy, I can barely have a conversation. But my 4 star rating is based SOLELY on their happy hour sushi prices. I seriously cannot find a place with cheaper sushi prices during happy hour. And you know what? Their sushi is pretty damn good. Not the best, but I like it. The Las Vegas roll is very yummy. Always comes out nice and toasty! If you're a sushi lover like me, this is the place to go for happy hour. You simply can't beat $4 for a LV roll anywhere. Service is quick and the staff is always friendly. If you can ignore the loud music and typical Scottsdale crowd, you'll love it.

After living here for 25 years, I finally got around to trying Oregano's. After so much build up, it was honestly a huge let down. I admit, I didn't order any pizza, so if that's what you should go there for, I'll have to make another visit.  But I've heard good things about their food in general and I was completely unimpressed. I ordered the beefstro salad with a "LARGE" amount of shaved rib-eye. There was nothing of the sort. Yeah, there was meat, but let's not go overboard by saying a LARGE amount in all caps. It was mediocre at best. Plus, my boyfriend's meatball sandwich came out literally 10 minutes before my food. He was almost done when I got my meal. That's a huge no-no at a restaurant. I was extremely annoyed. His meatball sandwich was nothing special. Seems no restaurant makes legit meatballs, just some canned bullshit that tastes generic. To top it all off, when my boyfriend was offered sweet potato fries or waffle fries, the server failed to tell him it was a $1 more for sweet potato fries. I guess it's on the menu, but if you're going to make it sound like it's an equivalent choice of sides, how should we know? You have to make that clear when offering. Duh.  The server was friendly and the overall atmosphere seemed nice, but that was a fairly lame experience. I doubt I'll even go back to give the pizza a try, too many delicious pizza places around to waste my time.

I could go here any time, any day. I love this place and have been multiple times. Many times while going to school at AiPx. They have quick service and hot food! I love the jade red chicken. I don't even like beans and still, theirs tastes magical! Top it off with a free tasty snickerdoodle and I'd be baffled if you DIDN'T love it. I really never get any of the Mexican dishes, not sure why, but I've scavenged stuff off my friend's plates and of course, it tastes just as good. Quick service, cheap price, tasty food. Go here if you haven't. Right now. GO!

Went here for a friend's bday and had a great time. They plugged in the lights outside as it got dark and it was so lovely. We ordered a few different salads and 3 different pizzas, along with a breaded mozzarella/rice ball paired with marina sauce as an appetizer. Everything was delicious! The salads were huge and not overly expensive considering the size. Our server (who I think was the manager possibly) was very friendly and the service was relatively fast. They brought out a massive Nutella crepe for the bday girl and the entire table promptly consumed it. Overall, wonderful evening and will definitely go back.

Tonight I finally tried this place. I went during happy hour (unknowingly) so I was VERY happy to see that drinks were 2-4-1. WOOT! What a great deal. I ordered a half and half order of their spicy and cinnamon fries. My God they were tasty! I LOVED the decor here too. Only 4 stars because I didn't really get to try the food, but it definitely had me intrigued. I will be back, Fez!

This might be my longest review ever. You don't have to read it, but you probably should.   How this place has over 700 reviews to begin with is beyond me. Not even Amy's Baking Company has that many reviews and, as you might know, was heavily trolled after it aired on Kitchen Nightmares. They must be handing out money to folks for writing this shit. Or they're planted reviews. What's even more baffling is that it has a solid 4 stars. Methinks something is not quite right, but whatevs. Let's move on, shall we?  This place is truly bizarre. I've been here maybe a total of 3-4 times since it first opened many years ago. It's a BBQ restaurant / club-lounge thingy. And as I learned for the first time at happy hour yesterday, it's apparently two different restaurants. At least, that's how everyone acted. My boss had made reservations for us in the Q Lounge for their Friday happy hour. Apparently you can just walk in (provided you're 21) and eat a buffet spread for free. But not until you get past the LAUNDRY LIST of dress code rules. Yes, a restaurant that serves BBQ, near Ghettrocenter, has a fucking idiotic dress code. Seriously some of the dumbest shit I have ever seen. I thought I was in metro Phoenix at a BBQ restaurant, not a Scottsdale nightclub. The list includes asinine things such as: No white t-shirts, no hats, no sunglasses, no sandals, and must be a cougar. I wanted to be like, mo' fucker, do you know this is PHOENIX? We wear sunglasses upon walking up. We wear hats to shade our faces from the blazing sun. We wear sandals, often times fashionable ones, so our feet don't get all sweaty. And white t-shirts? Now you're just acting foolish. Of course, my boyfriend whom I invited, was wearing a white t-shirt, with a nice button-up collared dress shirt (it was unbuttoned), a hat (a nice one, like derby style), and sunglasses because um, to shield your eyes? He was asked to button up his shirt, remove his sunglasses (no shit Sherlock, don't we all once we get inside?), and remove his hat. Mind you, he's a nice dresser, not some hobo with tattered clothes (usually). Had I not been invited by my boss to this happy hour, I would've bounced right then and there. It all just seemed like some giant, corny joke.  Time for a paragraph break. It helps your eyeballs if you break things up. I'd like to point out that the actual restaurant portion does not honor said happy hour. That's right, you must go to the 21+ side with the fun dress code rules to have happy hour, even though it gets insanely crowded with nowhere to sit. Oh wait, you CAN order a happy hour beverage, but you have to get up from the table and walk your ass to the bar. If you order a beverage at your table, it'll be full price.  I will now talk about the redeeming qualities which merited that killer 2-star review. The food is very good. The mac and cheese is the cheesiest, and all of the meat is incredibly tender. A wee bit overpriced, but not awful. They also give you free freshly-made donuts when you leave instead of a damn dinner mint. That's pretty dope. The staff is very kind. Our sever, Alicia (sp?), was very sweet and accommodating. Kudos to her.  Lastly, it's confusing as shit to get into this place. The parking lot is weird, and if you've never been, you'll have no idea where to enter. The Q Lounge vs the restaurant portion. Two different places, remember. Even though...it's...not.  Note: Just don't dress like you live in Phoenix. You might not get inside to the dopest dance club in all of metro Phoenix.

I have no idea how this place got 4.5 stars. Their food is possibly some of the worst food I have ever had. Ever. And that's pretty bad, as I'm not super picky. I've been to two of their locations and both times I was completely unimpressed.  First time I had a burger. I requested it rare, and of course it came out well done. Like damned rubber. Anyone knows that once you go rare, you don't dare...go...well done. Ok I was trying to be funny and I failed, but you get my point. And the food came in some crazy picnic-type containers. Shit you'd see if you bought it at the Fair or your neighbor's BBQ.  Second time was a salad. Trying to be healthy!!@#! The "greens" were pretty much ALL iceberg lettuce. REALLY you guys? REALLY? Too expensive for such a lousy salad. If I wanted to munch on what was basically water I would've ordered a free water! The one I created myself at Old Country Buffet tasted far far better.   The only thing it has going for it is decent drink selections/prices and a nice bar-like atmosphere. But tons of other bars have that too AND good food to boot. Like Santisi Brothers. Yeah, count this place out.  Oh, their logo is kinda nice. Makes me think the buffalo just drank Red Bull though.

I adore this particular Fox Restaurant. The decor is truly beautiful. They have empty jars hanging upside with lights inside that remind me of fireflies. Something about it makes me feel very cozy - and makes me want to steal the idea for my own house! They have an awesome happy hour and the food has been perfection every time I've been. Admittedly, I think I most look forward to their free bread though. Ha! I just love that oily pesto sauce! No one is looking to make out with me after I eat it, but it's totally worth it. The staff is friendly, knowledgable and quick. I especially liked the bartender, Justin. It feels upscale yet everything on the menu is affordable. Great spot to either take a date or to just chill out at the bar.

Found out the DJ there on Saturdays spins trip hop! RJD2, Pretty Lights, Bonobo, Kill Paris, Layo & Bushwacka and so much more. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go check it out. You will kick yourself for not knowing about this genre of music earlier.

So many pros about this place! Cheap prices, especially for gel nails. You get a free hot rock massage with you get a pedicure! That's what brought me here in the first place. The lady who works up front took me last minute right before they closed and stayed late just for me. She did a great job and was extremely sweet.

I went here ages ago and accidentally left my rant on their other page...you know, the separate restaurant that is literally physically connected but somehow a totally separate business entity. If you have to explain to your customers on your OTHER Yelp page that they've left a review at "the wrong restaurant", you done messed up on your branding, yo.  Anyway, you'd think after all these rants about your dumbass dress code bullshit you'd try to loosen up a bit. After all, you're located near Ghettrocenter. But nah, you stick to those guns! Bring that 2-star review down to 1! You can do it!

My home away from home! Bar Smith's number one best feature is its DJs. The music is ALWAYS on point. Whether it's the hip hop downstairs or the House upstairs. I always go here when I need to really get my dance on. The club is well known for it's resident DJs - Senbad and Pete Salaz. These guys are true Disc Jockeys. For real.  This spot is awesome if you're looking to spot some legit bboys and bgirls as well as a myriad of other awesome dancers. The drink prices are among average, similar to any other Phoenix bar I'd say. It's just always a good time, even when it's not that packed.  Forget Axis Radius or whatever, this is where the real music is.

I LOVE this place. When I lived over here I would go here constantly, like every week. It's very small and the service isn't the fastest, but the people barely speak English, so I'm not complaining too much.  It's definitely a legit Vietnamese place. The menu is huge! My favorite item is the rolls. They bring out a forest of garnishes - mint leaves, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. I always get the spicy pork. It's got nuts and chili flakes on it. Yum! They bring out the moist rice paper and away you go! The absolute best part is their peanut sauce. It's to die for. I asked for the recipe once and the little old lady (the owner) just laughed and shook her head and said, "haha no no...no." She reminded me of Superman's Hispanic maid on Family Guy.  Only con is their awful bathroom set up where you have to wait until the cooks are ready for you to walk back there. Kind of annoying. And they also can't accept credit cards for less than a $10 charge.

Yep, there's one in Phoenix my Flagstaff friends! So many people do not know we have one here too! The Place is always packed for breakfast - as it should be. The food is great! The portions are HUGE and fairly cheap. Even my glass of milk was just massive. But alas, so are most of the people who eat here. Service is mediocre, but the food does came out fairly fast, even when busy.

I love this place. It's 2 legit 2 quit. No but I'm seriously you guys, you should really check this place out. It's in a prime spot, has great "bar food" (it's way better) and a good drink selection. Prices are good and the atmosphere is great. The owner is one cool mofo and seems like the kind of person who would gladly sit down and have a beer with you. Service is quick and very friendly. My drinks are always long and strong and down to get the friction on.  Yeah!

GREAT Irish pub! i went on a Friday during the live music performance. I can't remember the name of the band, but they were awesome! The lead singer/guitarist was way into the crowd and got everyone hyped. I only had a few drinks, but a Sailor Jerry was only $3.50 and was very strong! I like cheap strong drinks! Definitely a good time. Will have to go back and try the food.

As a person on a budget, this place gets an extra star for their prices. Their constant Happy Hour menu is great. $7 for some tasty rolls? Sold. I'm not much of a sushi snob either, so they can probably get away with being somewhat mediocre and I probably won't even notice. I don't notice much anyway except for shiny objects.  Anyway, I went here last night for the 4th time and finally am giving it a review. Particularly because they're doing this neat thing for Christmas - the amount of money you donate to a family you receive back in a giftcard for Pearl Sushi. Donate $5, get $5 to spend there. Good concept, I dig that type of generosity. I don't think their food is outstanding, hence the rating. Particularly their Mango Summer roll was bland. The dipping sauce was good, but the rice paper and noodles were a little dry. This is really the only dish I can truly complain about though. The staff is very very friendly and you'll always win points with me for that no matter what.   I can easily get my cheap sushi fix here without spending very much. So I'm all like Hell yeah! To Pearl Sushi.

Had a really pleasant time here last night for dinner. It was popping when we arrived at 7:30, but luckily we had reservations. Started off with their bread/dip trio which was fabulous! The hummus and cheese were extremely tasty. I didn't try the olive mixture since I dislike olives, but I'm sure it was just as good. They continually brought out more delicious bread while we waited for our main course. After a solid 45 minutes of waiting, we realized...damn, where the hell is our food!? A few minutes later the manager came over and apologized for the long wait, he offered to get us anything and he himself delivered our food when it was finished. I had the chicken & prosciutto which was amazing! The chicken wasn't dry and the prosciutto added a nice salty flavor to the meal. The potatoes were great too, soft but crispy on the outside. I scavenged off my friend's plate to taste the mushroom risotto - BOMB! Yum. Our server was a doll too. Very sweet, fast and cute too! She gave us 2 free desserts and we sucked them down quickly. A Nutella crepe? Yes please. The sour cherry bread pudding was quite tasty as well.  I ate my leftover chicken about 10 minutes ago, not gonna lie.  Overall great night. Friendliness truly does make a difference. Thank you to our server Emily for being a gem. We'll be back.

How people can love this restaurant is beyond me. I've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because I thought their breakfast was OK.  Every time I go here I am unimpressed. My food comes out cold, overcooked and overall very bland. The only good thing are the biscuits you get to munch on beforehand. Even the cornbread tastes bland. I didn't think that was possible!  Boring and bland. I'd rather spend my money on The Waffle House.

I go here all the time. Very reasonable prices and I've only ever had 1 bad experience with one of the students - and they fixed it for free right away! I would definitely go here over Empire. Empire is cheaper but the students made me feel frightened for my hairdo. Kohler is friendly, accommodating and the students seem knowledgeable. I recommend this place all the time to my friends. I even had my makeup done here once and the girl did an amazing job! Great specials every month.

Went here for the first time last night. It was a Sunday night at 7:30, so a little dead, but very lovely nonetheless. The restaurant seemed very clean and modern. I loved the layout of the bar and all the glass windows.  We started off with the sea salt bread. It was a little too salty for my liking and I wished they had brought out butter. Then suddenly, for free, we got to try some little bruschettas. 3 each for each person. The olive one was way too olive-y for me, the tomato basil was fine, but the fig one was just right! I could eat many of those. We then had bacon-wrapped dates with maple syrup. If you're a sucker for sweet and salty like myself, you must try these. The sweetness was offset by the salty bacon, making for a very delicious appetizer. For my main course I had the spinach salad with strawberries, goat cheese, almonds and poppy seed vinaigrette. It was VERY tasty! I cleaned my very modern-looking plate/bowl. For dessert they give you free cotton candy! Not the first time I've seen this, but still, uncommon at least.   The drinks were a bit steep, but the staff was very friendly, professional and easy to talk to. Or server, Alexis, was funny and sweet.   Definitely will go back for lunch.

So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, "top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'". Or something like that.  This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).  My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.  Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, "I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.  So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.  You're welcome.

Been here twice, loved it both times! Had some type of thai pizza the first time. Very tasty! Second time had a salad, plenty of food for a decent price. And the service was fast! The staff is very very friendly and makes you feel welcome. I brought my dog both times and both times they gave her water. They weren't even scared of her (Great Dane). It's that kind of thing that makes me go back. Probably not my favorite pizza joint, but a good variety of pizza and great location for sure.

WTF? I thought for sure I had reviewed this place. Whoops. Ok, I really love Hanny's. Like for real, it's almost creepy. You instantly feel cool as fuck upon walking into this bar. A huge part of that is the AWESOME FUCKING MUSIC playing on Friday's and Saturday's, but the other part is the lighting and interesting layout of the place. It's very unique and almost secretive. There's a weird basement downstairs that you can't get into, then upstairs is where the DJ spins incredible electronic music. There's another upstairs section with a separate bar and dining area, nice little spot to chill. You can overlook the restaurant, make sexual eye contact with the DJ, and flick water onto unsuspecting patrons. What! I have never done that. The bathrooms are kinda weird, at first I struggled on where I was supposed to go and how to open the door. It's even more difficult when you're hammered, but usually there's someone else up there wandering around wondering the same thing. Together, you'll probably figure it out. The drinks are very unique and strong. A good variety to choose from. A tad bit pricey, but it goes with the style of the bar. The food is great too. I've had their sandwiches, salads and pizzas. All were just delicious! I get very excited every time the suggestion of going to Hanny's come up during the weekend. I highly recommend this spot. :)  *Side note - only reason for 4 stars instead of the 5 - sometimes the staff can be a little snotty. At least 3 separate times I've had both bartenders and servers act kind of rude. Not anything terrible, especially for a person like me who isn't bothered by much, but just a tinge of an attitude. Eh, maybe it's a coincidence. I've also have several pleasant experiences, clearly. Hopefully it was just a bad day for these folks.

I should really go here a lot more considering I'm giving it 5 stars, but for the handful of times I have been here, I've just always had such a great time that it warrants 5 stars. It's usually pretty crowded the times I've been (weekends), but every time service has been really great. Bartenders are quick and attentive, the majority of the crowd is pretty chill, the drinks are decently strong and the few menu items I've had were pretty decent for bar food! But my favorite thing though, yes here it comes, wait for you know I'm gonna say OMFG WTF BRB: I love the music. It's clearly just a mashup from an iPod, no DJ I was told. But whoever is picking the music (the owner? manager?) I love you. I love you because you played old school Incubus (Summer Romance!? Wow). I love you because you played Bop Gun by Ice Cube. I love you because you played Ghostwriter by RJD2. I think we're musical soul mates AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS!  Anyway, nice chill spot. Can definitely get a little rowdy, and you'll for sure witness some run-of-the-mill Scottsdale nerds if you go at 11pm on a Saturday night, but it's still fun.

Only a 20 min. wait on a very crowded Sunday, that's much better than most breakfast spots around town. Really liked the small, unique feeling inside. We got seated at the bar and service was very attentive and fast.  I had the turkey sausage omelette and ordered a chocolate strawberry pancake on the side. I literally could not inhale my main meal fast enough to get to that pancake. I was watching the whipped cream melt into warm chocolatey GOODNESS. Ok wait, let me point out that the turkey sausage omelette was very tasty. Melted mozzarella cheese with creme fraiche...mmm. But the pancake was tops. Soft, fluffy with yummy strawberries throughout. I don't know if it was anything special really, but it was quite tasty. Washed it all down with some orange juice and was one satisfied lady. Need to go back!

Possibly the most unique restaurant I've ever been to. This place is definitely for the open minded and willing to try new things.  I enjoyed everything I had. We had the 7 course meal. The portions are small, but by the end of the meal you're full enough. I think our portions are too large anyway in general. The homemade custard ice cream suckers were just delicious though!  Great ambience and concept. I've only been once, so I'll have to go again and see if it's equally good. The service was great and the chef was very friendly. As usual, customer service is key and is what earned this place 4 stars and not 3.

Dug it. Had the soyrizo burrito, very tasty. The potato hash I didn't like so much, sweet potatoes with vegetables tasted a little weird to me personally. Felt like the service could've been a wee bit faster as it wasn't terribly busy, but I liked everything overall. Will go back again to try something different! Dug the contemporary feel of everything.

I've only been to the W twice. Once was for a bachelorette party during the summer and we had cabana. It was fairly lush (I didn't pay) so I quite enjoyed it. But all I did was swim and tan, so can't really give a review off that.  But, I went again last night to their lounge. First of all, had we not known the DJ I doubt we would've been let in. We're not from Snobsdale, and we certainly stuck out. We were dressed fairly nice, just not wearing bizarre prom-like dresses and stripper heels. Anyway, once we managed to make our way upstairs, we were greeted with a wave of snobbery and ice cold glances. I thought American Junkie had the worst Scottsdale crowd. Nope. It's this place, folks. Some people were literally just standing there, not even talking. wtf? Do something! The only fun part of the night was dancing to the great music. *I* single-handedly got a fairly big dance party started. If it wasn't for me and my mad dancing skills, everyone would've continued to stand around like statues, afraid to move and mess up their hair or break a nail.   Meh. $9 drinks and boring crowd. No thanks.

I've never done CrossFit in my life, and thanks to Core, I am now obsessed. Everyone that works there is a BAMF. The coaches are extremely knowledgeable, friendly and patient. It surely is an intimidating thing at fist sight - everyone is in beast mode throwing massive weights around like teeny tiny babies. But the whole staff makes you feel immediately welcome and unafraid. Prior to Core, my strength was equivalent to that of a small child. But in just 2.5 months I'm faster, leaner and stronger. I can now confidently fight children. I know there's a lot of incorrect lifting and shitty "trainers" out there, but Core does not fall into that category whatsoever. Megan will roundhouse kick you if you deadlift incorrectly. Santana will answer any questions you have with great accuracy and swiftness whilst providing killer workout music. Preston, who is in fact the human version of Gumby, teaches core, stretch, mobility and HIIT classes that will make you sweat out of your eye sockets. Tupac is straight-up the nicest person in the history of people and Kristi makes you feel like you can tell her your deepest secrets during the brief 10 seconds it takes to sign in for class.  I could say a lot more, but like usual, I'm waxing poetic for absolutely no reason. I've never been to any other CrossFit gyms around town, so I don't really have a slew of opinions to give. But when something clicks, there's really no need to go elsewhere. A concept my ex-boyfriend never seemed to grasp.

I've been here 4 times. The first time I got their egg pizza. At first I was like, what? This is going to be weird...but it wasn't. It was absolutely delicious. Breakfast on a pizza? Soo tasty! And their beer selection is impressive! I just went there tonight and got their tasty reasonably-priced steak salad. As I expected it was quite good. The decor, ambience, food, people...really a great place.  But the real reason it gets 5 stars? Because of Tom, the manager. Our steak salads came out well done instead of our requested "rare." Not only did he sit and chat with us for about 5 minutes, he comped the salad and gave us a coupon for next time! We were super impressed. We didn't expect that at all nor even think it was necessary since we're not the complaining-type of patrons. But Tom showed us that he cared about his customers and wants us to come back again and again. And we will! Groovy.

I REALLY like this place. I've been twice for dinner and both times had a fantastic time. I've only ordered 2 different types of salad, but both were just amazing. All the items on their menu are totally unique and each one sounds more delicious than the next. Portion sizes are just right and the staff is very friendly and fast. I love the ambiance too. Of course I'm gonna say it, the music was right up my alley. Nice and chill, catchy. I dance a little whilst ingesting my meal. That is most excellent. I will keep going back and ordering new menu items until it is 5 motha fuckin' stars.

Dude.  I love this place. It's walking distance from my house, that is baaaad news for my thighs. I've driven past it multiple times and it never caught my eye. Finally, I did notice their large statue thingy outside of the establishment. It was all lit up as I drove by during the evening. When I realized it was a gourmet taco shop, I knew I had to go asap.   I went with my boyfriend and we both went to TOWN on their chips and assorted salsas. My favorite was the pecan salsa. Sweet and spicy! For our meals, he ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2. The pork tacos were slightly bland and made me worry at first that I was going to be let down, but then came the chicken mole taco - oh my! Delicious! Sweet and savory, it was perfect. I know that sauce is difficult to make too, so, well done. Most of the tacos actually don't come with cheese - you know why? Because the tacos are so bomb you don't even need the cheese really. Their flavors are very carefully picked to taste a certain way. Save the cheese and salsa for the chips! You'll enjoy the tacos just as they are.  YUM!

Damn, look at how many stars this place has out of 140 reviews. Nearly a 5 star rating. That's fucking phenomenal. And rightly so, as this place is truly a treasure among a trove of mediocre chain restaurants. Why on earth would you go to Carrabba's when this place is next door? First of all, cheese. Second of all, moar cheese. No seriously, if you like cheese, this is the place for you. And I. Love. Cheese. In case I was unclear earlier. If you don't like cheese, gtfo. You're dead to me. Not really, but this place is definitely all about some cheesy goodness. I ordered a savory crepe called "Roquefort". It's melted blue cheese, swiss cheese, sour cream, crushed walnuts and caramelized apples. DEAR GOD. I inhaled it. My friends both got some amazing-looking grilled cheese thing. There was cheese ON TOP of the bread. Wow! The food truly was unique, authentic and appropriately priced. I clearly enjoyed it to an extreme degree.  As for the service - great! Very friendly and inviting. The owner, Alain, was a complete sweetheart as well. He came over to our table and chatted us up. We asked him a ton of questions about his heritage and the restaurant itself. He was so genuine and kind-hearted, I could not wait to write my review about Le Chalet. And I certainly will be telling people to go there. He deserves the business, as I'd never expect such a gem of a restaurant to be located 56th Ave and Bell.  Holla

I had the most pleasant time here on Father's Day. I've been to The Vig plenty of times, but never on a Sunday during lunch and never the one Uptown. The food is always fabulous, and all Fathers got a free lunch on Father's Day! But the icing on the cake? The DJ. I love trip hop and it's really rare for a DJ these days to spin chill music like that. Not only that, but he had a live trumpet player keeping in time. He even busted out the bass. The fact that my Dad is a killer trumpet player and the fact that the DJ was spinning Mushroom Jazz (Mark Farina) seriously made my day. I could barely hold a conversation because I was grooving to the smoove tunes so much. Wrote about it on Facebook and got at least 3 people to check it out simply because I was raving about the chill vibe. And if you don't know what Mushroom Jazz is, you should.

Holy hipster Batman!  How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. The service is absolutely terrible. And if there's one thing you should focus on above all, it's the service. It gets 2 stars simply for being unique and interesting. It's a very large place and has a ton of knick knacks everywhere. They also fresh-squeeze all of their juices, which is pretty awesome to watch. The drinks are all unique, but slightly overpriced in my eyes. But the bartenders - oh the bartenders. Seriously, pick the pace up. I waited for 25 minutes just to even order my drink. Most bartenders will ask you want you want to drink WHILE making the previous customer's drink to help move things along more quickly. Not these guys. Nope. They have all the time in the world apparently. And it gets to the point to where you just simply want to leave because you're growing tired of just standing at the bar, waiting to order a damned drink. I'm a fairly patient person and I understand things get busy and you have to wait your turn, but this was just annoying and frustrating. My friend did order the sliders and they were rather tasty, although incredibly greasy. Nevertheless, I have no desire to spend a ton of time standing at the bar waiting for a frou frou drink that's costing me $11 when I could just go elsewhere and get a vodka cran for $4 in 5 minutes or less. Pick up the pace and I'd love to come back.

Super impressed by this place. I've been going to Central Nails on 30th St and Indian School Rd, but haven't really enjoyed it. Their facility smells and the nail techs always burn my nail beds with their tools. That's a big no-no. But for the same price and just a few miles further, I can get the same deal for a full set of acrylic nails ($25) at a much nicer facility. I walked in around 5:30 today and it was packed, yet they still managed to take me in less than 10 minutes. I can't recall the girl's name, but she was extremely friendly and fast. She was very gentle on my hands, which is huge for me because I'm not terribly fond of having my nails poked and prodded. Many nail techs just yank hangnails out or are just super rough. I requested very natural looking artificial nails and got exactly what I asked for. She finished up in about 50 minutes flat. The establishment was really nice, complete with a mini waterfall upfront. It felt very relaxing and didn't have that typical nail salon smell. Made me wanna go back for a pedicure.  Will definitely be back!

I don't think anyone loves going to the post office. Ever. It's crowded, slow and the employees always seems annoyed by everyone (rightly so). But the guy with the long curly hair - you are a gem my friend. I've been here 3 times now and have only actually interacted with you once, but you've been upbeat and positive every single time. Whether you think so or not, that positivity can have an impact on a random person's day. You are a stellar human. Keep smiling.

Went here for the first time for dinner tonight with my family and my best friend's family who were visiting from Pittsburgh. Was looking for a place to hopefully impress them. Turned out to be a great choice! Loved the menu selection, every single item was just slightly different. The menu was small, but not too small. Enough choices without it being terribly difficult to choose. Started off with a ton of appetizers. The pretzel bread, sweet potato chips, shoestring vinegar fries and 2 different types of wings. Every single appetizers was delicious. I think my favorite was the sweet potato chips. Nice and crispy. Each item was paired perfectly with a special dip. By the time our food came around we were already getting full! I had the shrimp soft tacos - amazing! The shrimp was crispy and perfect. I only could get one down, but it will serve as my lunch tomorrow. Tried the loaded mac and cheese too - rich and savory. I could eat that shit right now! Service was quick and friendly, no problems at all.  Would love to go back and try some of the other dishes on the menu. They serve brunch as well which also looked fabulous of course. Great spot and awesome location to sit outside on a sunny day.

I like this place. It gets hated on a lot by people, but I have a great time every time! The music is always great. Hardly any top 40 and tons of classics. Stuff I can get down to! Afterhours and only $5 cover if you get there late. Really, not a bad deal. I saw Beetlejuice from Howard Stern here last Saturday and was like HOLY SHIT. No one seemed to notice him but me. Whatever, good times!

I'm upping my starrage here. Starrage is a word. Do not argue with me.  I now know one of the partners/owners here, and he is a cool-ass mofo. And recently, the DJ was bumping Pharcyde and A. SKILLZ OMFG. Yeah, I have been known to give 4-5 star reviews solely because of the DJ. So what! Good music is such a rare thing that when I hear it, it brings complete joy to my very soul. That's deep, yo. But everyone is friendly here, unlike other Scottsdale spots. Dranks are strong, although I think the prices were upped recently. Oh well, still relatively cheap. I have never eaten here weirdly enough. I've never even been during daylight. Can't speak for their food, guess I'll have to try it someday.  Good service, nice people, no cover, good music, ROAR!  Thank you.

Completely unimpressed. Went here on Friday for my birthday expecting good things. I was pretty disappointed at the end. I was with quite a few people and they all concurred. The sushi was boring and bland, very small rolls especially considering the price. Our server was sweet but not very fast and took forever to come back and take our food orders. Our food came out staggered with huge gaps in between (a big no no at restaurants, timing is everything). One of my friend's beers came out completely warm - WTF? The only good thing was that the drinks were strong and the staff was friendly. This place was a miss for me.

I have nothing bad to say about this place. Absolutely nothing. Went here for my birthday yesterday afternoon with my family. Based on the location I was unsure of what it would look like, but it was just beautiful. They seated us in a quiet cozy corner in the back of the restaurant. Started off with the Golden Polenta Fries which were AMAZING. They came out piping hot and cutely displayed. The spicy aioli sauce paired perfectly with it! Extremely tasty. I ordered the grilled chicken salad, which was also displayed very nicely. Dates, goat cheese, nuts...a great mixture of flavors. The service was very friendly and polite. It was really a treat on such a lovely day in Phoenix. Would love to go back again and try some of the other items. Truly a gem of a restaurant in South Phoenix.

Their delivery quickness is almost mutant-like. You order and BAM, they're here in 10 minutes. Ridiculous! Their sandwiches are pretty good too. Nothing amazing, but for a $4 Slim with mustard/mayo packets on the side and I don't have to move my ass from my seat all in 10 minutes flat? That sandwich suddenly tastes like a million bucks. Or like $8. Whatever.

I went here for ladies night last night and was pretty happy. 50% of all drinks and cute little $3 appetizers. I had french fries, a chicken salad slider and 2 glasses of Sangria. Bill was $14. That's pretty cheap, especially considering the location.  I really LOVE the decor and branding. It's not often a company is willing to spend the money on making their brand unique and consistent. They really play on the "narcisse" aspect. A huge mirror on the wall to mirrored bathroom stalls, I was thoroughly impressed. And as a graphic designer, that can be hard to do sometimes.  I also met Tom, one of the owners. He was very pleasant. I don't hang out in N Scottsdale often since it's not really my cup of tea, but everyone was very nice at this cute lounge and made me feel very comfortable. If I walk away with a cheap bill and a smile on my face, I'm a fan.

Went here for bubbles & brunch last Sunday. What a great deal! Truly is bottomless bubbles. We got orange juice and sipped mimosas for hours. A wee bit tipsy by the end, but what a good time. Had the banana nut bread as a starter, SUPERB. Delicious fig spread and the bread was moist with a slightly crunchy outer edge. Had the spinach and goat cheese omelet - was a smidge bland, but still tasty nonetheless. Service was excellent and it was refreshing to see the decor in daylight. I felt very relaxed and a little girly. :)

Food was amazing! The grilled beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly rare for me. I especially loved the bleu cheese sauce. The black truffle hummus is delicious. But what I most loved was the Fromage - the crispy goat cheese was amazing. Crispy on the outside, warm on the inside. Perfection with the tomato marmalade.    Staff is incredibly friendly and happy. They all seem to genuinely enjoy working there. This type of service makes me want to come back. I appreciate that above all.  The decor is stunning - very mod. I love the entire concept - from the branding to the interior design. It all meshes very well. I was digging the DJ too. Great mix of music. I have high hopes for Scottsdale Quarter's latest addition.  Be sure to try the Lola Martini. Delicious.

I love this place! It's very cozy and unique. The food was great - I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious! The apple slaw was so yummy and I normally don't like slaw. My friend had their New York Steak and the onion jam was very tasty. I couldn't decide if I wanted to keep eating mine or steal theirs!   Small menu, but it makes ordering short and simple. This works well for some people. All of the food came out very quickly and the staff was very friendly. I really dug the way they did the orders. The owner is a genius. The most appealing thing is their prices - equivalent to that of a TGI Friday's-type restaurant, but with far far better quality food. This is unusual for scottsdale price-wise. Great for people like me who don't have a huge wallet!  Will definitely go back to try their salads. Love the design of everything! Great branding and wonderful concept overall.

I was skeptical at first upon going here. Their sign was seriously hand-written. I love hole in the walls, but sometimes it's too hole-in-the-wallish and downright bad. Not so with this gem. The owner of the place was running the cash register and looked totally out of place. Tall white dude serving Mexican food? He spoke Spanish too. He was extremely nice and funny. He had his son running around serving everyone - I loved that family vibe.  After we ordered a ton of food for all of like $14 we sat down and patiently waited. It was a bit of wait, but it was also fairly crowded. I could see the people hard at work in the back. They were legit hand-rolling the tamales. Impressed! I ordered something called a "Molote" which I've never had before. It was like a potato thing stuffed with chorizo. Awesome. I had 2 of them and literally inhaled them. I also inhaled a bunch of carne asada tacos and a shrimp taco as well. They come with some very tasty salsa and unknown green sauce. There was a fish taco in the mix which wasn't as good as the rest of the food, but no matter. For the price we paid, I was a happy camper.   It was weird, when I left I felt "meh" about that place, but now sitting here typing this I seriously crave it. That's good food! I still prefer La Condesa, but they're more for gourmet tacos. This is your $2 taco fix right here, boys and girls.

Finally, a Vietnamese place that gets pretty close to Pho Avina's. This is a first!  Went here with a friend for lunch Sunday and really loved it. The menu items were decently-priced and service was snappy. I started with a spring roll. It was quite large and unlike many Vietnamese places, not at all dry, sticky or flavorless. The peanut sauce was perfect! I had some type of pork salad as my entree (I can't recall the name!) and it was very tasty as well. Serving size was quite large and the dressing was very good. The pork was cooked perfectly with a nice crisp to it. Overall, VERY satisfied and pleased to finally find a Vietnamese place near me that isn't mediocre.  Only tiny complaint is I didn't care for the bathroom setup. Seemed overly hipster-ish and pointless. Sinks were separate from the bathroom and in the open. Kinda awkward? There was a chair and 3 cushions in the bathroom...in case I wanted to sit down and watch someone? Lol.

Our office goes here like once a week. It's retarded, but we love it. But when you're VIP ballers, this place is awesome. You jealous?

My first time here. I got a $20 coupon in the mail, so I figured eh, free meal. I went here with my boyfriend and we were instantly greeted with friendliness from the staff. We ate at the bar and our bartender, Nate, couldn't have been more pleasant. He was chatty while still paying attention to all the other customers. Service was quick and the food was great! My boyfriend had the meatloaf - DAMN! That's some good shit. Even the rice and beans tasted unusual. I can always appreciate when a restaurant attempts to make ordinary, normal Mexican side dishes taste spectacular. It was truly a savory dish. I had the Tomatillo Salad with carne asada, it was very delicious. But honestly it paled in comparison to my boyfriend's meatloaf. I wanted to eat his entire meal!  Overall, great first impression. We'll be back.

Well, they definitely enforce the dress code. Ladies, don't rely on your looks! If you aren't wearing the shortest dress ever, forget it. The club felt like a cheesy version of Vegas and everything was totally overpriced. If not for the good company of friends, I would've peaced out to a more comfortable club.  What bothers me most about this club is the entire attitude. On their Facebook page they happily say Scottsdale is "going downhill" and credit themselves with bringing them out of it by having a retarded dress code. They think the "upper class" should remain the upper class. Right, you charge $10 for a cover in Arizona. Go to LA where they charge $45 or more for a mediocre club and get back to me about that upper class.    Only pros - the bathroom was interesting. Bizarre really. Not bad, not good, just different. Good place for hitting on people. The staff was actually strangely nice to people in line. One guy was particularly hot and funky.

Really like this bar. It's very hipster, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just some information for those who think Yelp is God. I love the setup of this place. Nice little patio outside on both sides, average-sized bar area, and then a separate room for shows. I really like seeing shows here. The sound system is great and they even have an area to sit if you don't feel like standing. The drinks are cheap and strong. I've only had their salsa (very good) so can't say much about the food, but I've heard good things. The music is always popping here and Sean Watson makes me smile when he goes on. He played Chromeo's "Tenderoni" one time when I was there and I danced so hard I nearly vomited.  If there's a spot you should hit when downtown, it's Crescent.

This place was dead on a Saturday night at 11 PM. How does that even happen? I only visited the top and bottom floors. The bar itself was rather drab and had no personality. I could care a less that it was more of a "dive" bar, I love dive bars. But this wasn't a dive, it was just boring. The bartender at the top level was cool at first, until he got other customers. Then he started straight-up ignoring us. We asked for our bill 5 times and he continued to serve everyone else ahead of us. Get your flirt on, bro, I'm not mad about that. Just try to serve people in order and we'll be happy campers.  Bottom floor had a sweetie bartender named Pam. Liked her. The DJ also threw on some Groove Armada and made me extremely happy. I was drunk and satisfied, but the ambience of the bar was severely lacking, making me not really want to visit again.

4.5 stars? That's ridiculous. This place deserves 5 solid stars. Period. Don't argue with me. A friend of mine introduced me to this place about 3 or 4 months ago and I have since gone back an embarrassingly amount of times. Actually, fuck that. I'm not embarrassed, it's tasty as HAIL. Hands down, the best street tacos in AZ. Not even joking. Every single person I introduce to this place becomes just as obsessed as I do. I go about every other week at this point on Thursday or Sunday. I honestly do not order anything other than the $1 tacos. I have no doubt their other items are really amazing as well, but I have no desire to cram anything into my mouth other than those sweet, sweet tacos. I usually order a mix of carne asada, pollo and "vegetarian" tacos, which is just black beans. I have never once been disappointed. They do have weird hours and are located next to Charlie's, so if you go here during peak hours (i.e., when the club lets out at 2am), you'll will be faced with a very large line. Things can get a little slow when it's busy. But hey, these people are creating ART. So you shut your pie hole and wait in line. The lovely lady who runs the register is extremely sweet and is a damn pro at dealing with the drunk fashionable men and random hobos who stroll in off the street looking for a handout.  But really, you haven't had a legit taco in AZ unless you've been here. America's Taco Shop? Nah. Gallo Blanco? Puh-leez. Dig the loose change out of the bottom of your purse/car cup holder and hit this place up for a taco or 5.

I have the exact same complaint as Marsella M. below me. I was also invited to what I thought was "complimentary" food and appetizers. I saw nothing of the sort. Nope, a server told me there was a $25 VIP fee for a fixed menu that you could order off of. Myself and 2 friends were starving. We decided to stay and just order some food and drinks, at least give it a try. After about 40 minutes of waiting, our server informed us that the order couldn't even be put in until 8PM (20 min. later), which is when the full menu would open up to the non-VIP people. We lamented for a bit and contemplated going to Ra Sushi instead. But our server was clearly making a good effort to keep us there by giving us a round of free drinks and a free appetizer, so we stayed. While the drinks were good, the appetizer was boring and cold. It was little tiny grilled cheeses with a slice of tomato on top. They were a little stale actually and the sauce on the tomatoes was unpleasant. I was the only one who ate them, but mostly because I was so incredibly hungry I couldn't help myself! I order their grilled chicken salad which was $10. The price was good, but the salad was filled with mostly iceberg lettuce. I freaking HATE iceberg lettuce. It's like the garbage of lettuce. I picked around it and basically ate all the other ingredients. It wasn't bad necessarily, just overall not an impressive salad whatsoever. Furthermore, their appetizer/snack selection was so bizarre. Nothing but their $9 french fries sounded good, which is way too expensive. I don't want fried pig ear, brussel sprouts, fried cauliflower or whatever other wannabe-eclectic shit you're offering. It's totally fine to put unusual things on the menu, but every single snack item sounded horribly unappetizing. Lastly, there were like a bazillion flies outside. Quote: "I have to squint so I don't get flies in my eyes."  The entire event was honestly a waste of my time. I really doubt I'll be going back to try anything, not with sushi right next door. I do thank our server lookalike Anne Hathaway for the effort though.  Oh, and whoever designed your menu needs to find a damned high-res version of your logo. Shit was REAL grainy.

First time there last night for a special event. So far, I am digging it. I really enjoyed the decor. It felt cozy and spacious, which is hard to find in Scottsdale. Things tend to get crowded quickly, but I felt there were tons of places for me to stand or sit down without getting smooshed (I'm a shawty). I went during Happy Hour so the drink specials were great. $4 for a well drink. Normal hours seemed to have slightly expensive cocktails for my taste, but nothing horribly overpriced. My friend and I split the chicken sandwich which had a delicious fig spread on it. The chicken was very tender and there was enough food to fill both of us. We migrated to the patio where I had a cider beer for only $6, very tasty. My friend had their strawberry shamrock which was BOMB. Whoa! I barely got a sip in before she sucked it down. Damn Vanessa! It was actually a fairly nice, breezy night last night, which made for that much nicer of an evening. I had a great time and would love to come back and try the full menu. Good luck guys!

Just had breakfast here today and am already planning my next trip back. Bam! The decor is very interesting and allows a lot of natural light into the place, which I always love. Staff was immediately friendly and happily answered any questions we had. I had some egg strata thing that was pretty amazing, but my friend had a meal that was better than mine! Damn it! Don't you hate when you try your friend's food and you wish you had ordered that instead? Bastard! He had some pita thing with sausage (sorry I suck at remembering meal names) and it was soo damn tasty. I loved the seasoned potatoes on the side as well. I do not drink coffee, but according to my friend his iced vanilla latte was amazing. We finished our meal off with their blueberry coffee cake. Pretty good! Slightly dry, but my mom's a baker so I'm biased ;) (yeah Ugly Cakes!). They are VERY decently priced with no meals over $9! Great little spot, can't wait to try the other menu items.

The Banging Pocket is by far one of the best breakfast items in Phoenix. No joke. I get cravings for it. That smoked gouda, man. It makes all the difference.

Have been twice and so far, so good. I've only been on Saturdays and both times, the DJ blew my mind. He played some Big Boi and Philippians Remix of "Runnin'" which made my night. I get so excited over awesome music. My only issue though - it's not very crowded. :( I love to dance but when the dance floor is only half full, it's just not as fun. The gogo dancers are fantastic though. Scottsdale girls - take a note from these ladies. They tear it up! The drinks were very strong (yay alcoholism!) and the crowd is diverse. It seems so promising, but they need to draw in a larger crowd or it won't last.

I've only been here once, recently, and I really enjoyed it! I like that they go for the fitness/health angle, offering protein shakes and coconut water. Right up my alley. But even better, is that it's affordable. A good-sized salad for $7, $9 with chicken? Oh snap! That's a great price. Fresh, warm chicken and just the right amount of dressing. I inhaled that thing in like 5 min. My boyfriend had a salad as well, but him being a 6'2" man, the salad didn't really fill him up. But whatever, it's all about us, right ladies? Haaay! Totally kidding, that's really bitchy. He ended up ordering a strawberry/banana protein shake that was very good to satisfy his manly tummy. Too bad it's a little far from my house, about 15-20 min. But if I'm in the area or have time, it's totally worth it.   Only complaint is that I feel they should have nutritional facts about their items listed somewhere. It's a health-conscious restaurant, after all. That type of crowd tends to want to know that stuff. I know I did when I was there. Please open a downtown Phoenix location! :)

I really dig this place. But honestly, I just love the atmosphere. It's a perfect spot to go to on a nice day in Phoenix. It's admittedly VERY crowded during lunch and brunch (on weekends), but so far I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. So, no complaints there. I do think it's overpriced for both drinks and food. $10 for most cocktails and $15 for a salad? Kinda steep, but it's a Fox Restaurant so not shocking. The food is above average like all his other restaurants, but nothing to write home about. The staff was very friendly, attention and tattooed! Holla! But like I said, it's the actual structure of this place that I really enjoy. Lovely natural light shining into the building, kick back with my $10 beverage and watch people play cornhole. Yeah, I'm good with that.

Hit this place up last week with my boyfriend. First of all, I love that they're open until 10pm on weekdays. Most restaurants like this are closed by 9pm. First impression on menu items is that they're fairly cheap. Items are around $9 on average. Chips and salsa are free! Score. Since it's the same owner/chef as Gallo Blanco, the food is very similar. But I think the prices are much more reasonable. I had the asado chicken salad - portion size was good, I couldn't finish it. It was extremely tasty and I promptly inhaled it. Boyfriend had the pollo asado. Also quite tasty and he ate the entire thing like a fat kid. Our server was extremely pleasant and pretty funny too. Overall, we had a great evening and intend on returning!

My boyfriend and I love Vietnamese food and were in downtown Phx for First Friday, we saw this place and figured we'd give it a go. First of all, they clearly have an underage drinking problem as we had to get wristbands in order to drink any alcohol. Strange at a restaurant. The DJ was spinning decent music, but he was not a good DJ in terms of skills. Kept fucking up transitions - I thought Serato made that shit easy? Anyway, we're seated right away, but for a good 10 - 15 min. no one brings us any water or acknowledges us. Finally we flag someone down and just go ahead and put our orders in. It seriously takes like another 5 minutes just to bring us water. It was busy at the bar, but the dining area itself was not packed, mind you. My boyfriend orders Pho, I order a pork vermicelli dish of some sort, something I get often at Viet places. I request peanut sauce instead of the fish sauce, because, well, I fucking love peanut sauce. I will seriously BATHE in that stuff. If I see something has peanut sauce in it, I will order it solely for that reason. So anyway, I make this clear to the server. Our food comes out at a reasonable pace, but I receive fish sauce. I kindly ask for peanut sauce, and the server alerts me it's going to be 15 minutes before I can get peanut sauce. Wait, hold up. You're a Vietnamese restaurant that is out of peanut sauce!? That has literally never happened to me. And I frequent Vietnamese places A LOT. I luh me some noodles and whatnot. I said fine, I'll wait for the peanut sauce and use hoisin sauce in the meantime. 15-20 min. go by and I remind our server I am still waiting. He disappears and comes back to let me know that they are out of it for the evening. So, you lied initially? Alrighty then. I guess you thought I wouldn't want it because of the wait? Did I mention I worship the peanut sauce God? Should've just been honest in the first place. Although, dude, Vietnamese restaurants don't run out of peanut sauce. C'mon now.  The food itself was mediocre. My noodles were cooked beyond al dente and my boyfriend told me his Pho was mediocre as well. Prices were about average for that type of food and the servers were nice, plus location is great for people watching, hence it's 2 stars instead of 1.  Overall, if something stood out here I would've mentioned it and given it a better rating. However, a very bland and irritating experience overall. Especially when PHO motha fuckin' THANH is not far away on 17th Ave and Camelback and is far, far more awesome. Cheaper prices and better food. And they have an endless supply of peanut sauce. Amen.

I've been stalking Taco Guild for months now. Every time I'd go to Starbucks next door, I'd creep on Taco Guild, snapping pics of the structure and the dope typography on the wall. Being sure, of course, to upload it on Instagram and hash-tag it with things like #omgtacos #imadesigner #typographynerd #wheredemtacos. So as you can imagine, when they finally opened, I was quite excited and had high hopes for the restaurant.  First of all, there was a lot of meticulous thought put into this entire concept. Being a designer/art director, I know what it takes to maintain a level of consistency throughout a restaurant. This place was just excellent in terms of execution and aesthetic. The actual building itself was gorgeous, and I'm a huge sucker for stained glass windows. Everything from the logo, to the murals, to the design of the menu - color me impressed. Which is the color of chartreuse, I heard. Anyway, we all know why I really went - to stuff my chipmunk cheeks with savory tacos. You can have awesome design, but the food is key (duh). I started off with the chips and salsa - pretty standard, good salsa. Whatevs. I was particularly hungry, so I ordered 3 tacos and 2 sides. I had the peking duck, molida lamb, and guild chicken with a side of red beans and grilled corn. The tacos were very delicious, I loved the unique toppings and flavors to all 3. My favorite however was definitely the lamb. The sides didn't disappoint either, both were packed with flavor and by the time I had consumed everything, I was quite plump and happy. There was no way I could eat any more food and...oh what's that? You have a prickly pear sorbet? Sure I'll take that as well. This turned out to be an excellent idea, as it was the perfect amount of sweetness to satisfy my sweet tooth.   So why the 4 stars instead of 5, Lindi K.? Cause I felt like it yo! Just kidding. It's because I felt the food was a wee bit overpriced (but not surprised by this) and because the tacos weren't as good as Taqueria Los Yaquis, which is literally $1 for a taco. Although, Taco Guild does have a bar...bonus. No matter though, the entire concept was impressive and I had a lovely time there. I think this place will do very well.

I went to Snooze several months ago, around when it first opened. I totally spaced on writing a review. D'oh! But I remember everything so well, I'll just go ahead and write one anyway. 4 months later. Gonna be super accurate.  I went here with 2 other friends of mine during peak brunch hour. i.e., when yo' ass rolls out of bed on a Saturday around 10:30AM. It was pretty crowded, but we only ended up waiting about 20 minutes or so. I just stood outside and snapped pictures of their awesome sign. Such pretty typography + signage (insert nerdy laugh-snort). Once inside and seated, I became increasingly impressed by their fantastic brand consistency. Everything felt so...cool and retro. What the Hell guys, why didn't you hire me as your graphic designer!? I would've traded my work for food. Anyway, our orders were promptly taken by extremely friendly staff. It DID take an overly long time for our food to arrive, but they hadn't been open very long and it was ridiculously busy, so I wasn't too surprised by that. Once the food came, I snarfed it down and washed food particles away with some delicious mimosas. I don't have a massive appetite usually, but I felt their dishes were perfectly proportionate. Just enough food to fill you up, but not too much to put you into a brunch food coma for the rest of the afternoon. I wish I could recall exactly what I ate, but I'm writing this review 4 months later, so my memory is a bit wonky. Oh, remember a few sentences ago when I said our food took a while to arrive? They felt the need to make up for that by gifting us a free pancake that tasted like A FREAKIN' SAMOA. Yeah, I forgive you. Like immediately. Overall, everything was really tasty and appropriately priced. Staff was genuinely kind and really easy to interact with. It gave me the opportunity to crack a bunch of cheesy jokes with our server.   I haven't been back since, mostly because I just eat a banana for breakfast when I wake up in the morning. But next time I get HONGRAY for some brunch, I'll definitely hit this place up. Plus, I can ride my bicycle there! Wow dude!  bye

My sister and I ate dinner here for the first time last night and were completely impressed in every aspect! We were immediately greeted by cordial staff and didn't have to wait very long to be seated (although we did have a reservation). Our server was Shane, a guy who is clearly a baller. He was sweet, funny and answered all of my asinine questions about the myriad of items I didn't recognize on the menu. He happily recommended we get this cray cray drink that had ROCK CANDY in it. Like a stick of rock candy. It was fucking adorable! Naturally I took several pictures of this drink like a badass nerd. I would post it on here, but I am super lazy. Anyway, we ended up ordering the duck ramen soup and the blue cheese steak salad with a side of fries for our meals. It all came out pretty quickly, which was good, because those rock candy dranks were quite strong and I needed food in my belly. The duck ramen soup was amazing! It was spicy, flavorful, and made me feel like a warm toasty marshmallow. I loved it. My sister's salad was also really bomb. Hey, did you know they make their own ketchup? Well now you do. You can tell too, it tastes amazing! We finished off our meals with the ice cream cones. You get 2 little ones that are perfect for sharing. We got the bourbon cherry ice cream with dried cherries on the side. Not surprisingly, it too tasted great. Everything was moderately priced and I felt the portion sizes were proportionate to the cost. Overall, it was a really great evening. Everyone was super upbeat and friendly and the vibe of the place is very chill. Not too staunch, not too laid back, just right. Well done, friends.  Oh and the music? Whoever is selecting that, I love you. Is that awkward? Please play more Wagon Christ. :) It makes me click my heels together in mid-air.

Alright. I've been here twice and had 2 slices each time. I think 4 slices of pizza merits a review now.  I really don't eat pizza all that often, it's way too glorious and I can't control myself. I end up eating an absurd amount for a 5'2" girl, and I do it in record time. BUT, I make an exception for Grand Ave Pizza. This place is just...delightfully delightful. It is full of delightfulness. They keep things quite simple - it's small, cozy, and the menu is easy. You either order cheese, pepperoni, or the special (which changes often). On both my visits I had a slice of pepperoni and the special that day. That pepperoni pizza is no regular pizza. It's a perfect tender mix of crunchy softness. The crust isn't hard and overcooked, but it's not overly-doughy either. I noticed some people soaking up the grease with their napkins...haha! You sissies. I'll take ALL OF IT. The first special I had was the pork verde salsa - I found this slightly awkward to eat because of the large chunks of pork, but it was still very delicious. I have to say, it didn't top the pepperoni though. HOWEVER, on my second visit, the special that day DID blow my God damn mind. It was like...feta cheese (I think?), mozzarella, pineapples, balsamic vinegar, and fairy dust. I don't ever want fruit on my pizza, but holy Hell. What a great combo. Had my belly not been so full like a small Buddha, I would've gladly had another slice.  Their prices per slice average right around $3-$4 and they're pretty big. They're open super late AND deliver! I am sadly not within their delivery radius, but I would gladly go out of my way to pick up a pie. According to my east coast friends, pizza by the slice is not too common in Arizona. I'm glad that Grand Ave Pizza is filing that void. Dig the artwork too. Great spot, I think it'll be around for a long time.

Staff is super friendly and beers are real tasty and affordable. My only 2 quarrels: It's so damn HOT in there! It's like a SAWNA! (sauna). Not sure if it's because the doors are always open or what, but good Lord, Ima just bring my workout gear in the future and do some hot yoga. Secondly, when you blow that paper confetti everywhere, people slip and fall on it! Seems like a good way for someone to create an injury issue. But wtf do I know. I'm just a nice kid with some nice dreams.

My boyfriend and I had heard about Eklectic Pie via Facebook because pizza. And even though we live in downtown Phoenix, we decided to endure the insane 20 min. drive to see what the fuss was all about. We got there an hour before closing time on a Thursday. Things were pretty quiet, which meant no line and faster pizza into my mouth. Everything about this place is really slick. The logo outside is a super bright yellow and eye-catching in the evening. Inside, things are cool, industrial, and unusual. It felt thought-out and meticulous. Once in line, you get the option of 1. choosing your pizza size (7" or 11"), 2. picking your sauce and 3. mixing up a variety of awesome ingredients at no extra charge. Shut the front door! No extra charge! A part of me wanted to go nuts, but the other part of me was lazy and really hungry, so we chose to go with 2 different pre-made pies from the "wall of fame". The "Meaty Italiano" and "Besto Pesto Chicken". No dessert this go around, but next time for sure. I don't drink soda, but my boyfriend commented on how the soda was really good and not a corporate brand like Coke or Pepsi, but instead a brand I had never heard of called "Boylan". He was a fan.  Anyway, we waited for what felt like about 8 minutes and BAM. Pizza was all up in my grill. Being the meat-lover that I am, I definitely favored the Meaty Italiano. The Besto Pesto Chicken was great too - I think in the future I'd ask for more pesto sauce though. I would've loved to try one of the spicy options, but my boyfriend is a white kid from Vermont. So clearly that'll have to be a solo visit next go-around. All around, the staff was super friendly and made the ordering process very clear and easy. Prices are affordable, pizzas were crisp and fresh. If you live in Mesa or want to hang out with the new pizza kid on the block, go check out Eklectic Pie!
