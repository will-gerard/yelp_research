I called Steve last week after just getting back from a week and a half long road trip. I'll be honest, my car looked like shit before the road trip however, it was unbearable after the road trip especially considering I took my dog along with me.  Having spoken with a few other detailers I was worried it was going to be a 1-2 week long wait or extremely expensive for just an interior/exterior clean. Steve was awesome though and booked me time a few days later at a reasonable price.   Three guys showed up (on time which I feel like never happens) and did a great job. They took a little longer than expected but that was due to construction next door getting dust in my car whenever they opened my doors. I'm sure they could have just left and blamed it on the construction but they asked me to move my car to a different spot and continued working. Real pros!

Gill was a regular at University down in Tempe but only because that's where the rescue I adopted him from got him vaccinated. After 6 months or so I realized it was time to find a new vet that is much closer.   I did some browsing on Yelp and found Dr Ryan. The man is pure class. I've only been here twice but both times went as smoothly as they could possibly go. The staff is sweet and Dr Ryan knows his shit. He explains everything and does his best to educate you on how to keep your pet healthy.   If Gill is a fan then so am I!

I just moved out recently after spending a year at this small complex. I liked to call it my oasis. It's a very small complex with about 20 units all owned by a few investors from Canada. Sean was the property manager and was on point with everything. There really wasn't anything not to like. Units are fairly updated, great size, very affordable, decent location (in terms of distance to old town, not the actual surrounding neighborhood), dog friendly, and a cute little courtyard with a well kept pool.   I was ready to give these guys 5 stars up until I received notice that I would be getting none of my security deposit back. By no means do I claim to be the cleanest guy this side of the Mississippi. The bathrooms needed a cleaning but I'm hoping you clean those after every tenant anyways. Yeah, the carpets were a mess but they replace the carpets after every tenant. On top of that, the owner mentioned that they were now switching to hardwood (or maybe laminate) so carpets were no longer needed. Despite that I was still deducted a hefty amount due to the carpets? If this is standard protocol why are you charging me for it?   I get it, you own a real estate property and want to squeeze every penny out of it. But this will be the first time in 8 years of renting that I receive not a single penny of my deposit.   I'm reasonable so I'll give them 2 stars. But I'm still very very upset.
