Last meal in Vegas before flying home. Fabulous food and outstanding service. The goat cheese fundido was scrumptious as an appetizer. I had grilled mahi mahi which was very flavorful and had a spicy twist. I love spicy so it was right up my alley. Wife had smoked shrimp tacos which were excellent as well. If in Vegas this is a must meal!

My wife and I ate a late dinner here after arriving in Vegas. Beautiful restaurant. Took us immediately to table even though we didn't have reservation. Because of the late hour we split a large New York strip and potatoes au gratin. Excellent steak, potatoes were awesome. Server was highly attentive. This restaurant is definitely on our list when we return to Vegas next month.

Went here with business group while in Vegas. My wife and I split the larger filet and Mac n cheese. My wife and I both had to diplomatically remove large pieces if gristle from our mouths. Didn't want to send back because our host was sitting across table. Steak lacked flavor and was not an excellent piece of meat.   Waiter up sold the sides as plenty to share. While the Mac n cheese was good it was a small portion that I could have easily finished by myself.   Only reason this is not one star is because of good service.   Travel to Vegas on regular basis. Will not eat here again.

American Express is redefining airport lounges with Centurion. While our favorite is still DFW (free massages) Vegas Centurion is fabulous. Comfortable, upscale setting. Excellent freshly made food. Great bar with top shelf liquor. Customer service fabulous!  Amex treats its customers fantastic!

This place was just ok compared to other airport lounges. Since it was free for us it was better than sitting in crowded terminal. If you had to pay $35 entry fee you would probably not be happy. Very limited snack selection and very small bar with limited choices. The bartender was the same person assigned to clean up and replenish snacks. Very small facility. If it's free go. If not, save your $$$.
