Pane Bianco is like the kid that people like because he's related to his "cool" older brother.  Overall it's a nice restaurant.  The prices are a tad expensive, but reasonable and the menu is small but adequate.  It won't blow your socks off, as evident by the fact I can't remember what sandwich I ate there.  I won't go out of my way to eat here again, but it's conveniently located next to a great coffee shop so I'm sure I'll be back.  Bottom line: if you come here you will enjoy it, and you won't be shocked at your check.  But don't expect to be amazed by the food

Coffee is a little more expensive than starbucks, but not as noisy or crowded (so it's a better place to study).  Free wi-fi and big windows.  Employees are nice.  For those of you that go to Coffee bean a lot: if you are a costco member you can go to costco.com and buy $100 worth of gift cards for $80.  Unfortunately they don't have much for food beyond pastries, but there are several restaurants in the same strip mall if you want to grab a bite.

Living on the west side (especially the NW side) of phoenix, you will soon discover the splendors of a suburban, mostly caucasian demographic.  In other words, lots of chain stores and restaurants with most of the food tasting about the same.  That being said Abuelo's is a step above the rest around here.  If you're looking for authentic, high quality mexican food this isn't the place.  You'd be better served going to somewhere in Scottsdale, Phoenix or Tempe.  If you're trying to decide between Macayo's, Abuelo's, salsa blanca, top shelf, and carramba...then this is the place to go.  It can get a bit busy, so come here on the earlier side or expect to wait.  They got a great happy hour menu, and the food is pretty decent tex-mex.  Their salsas are pretty good.  Nothing you eat here will knock your socks off, but you won't be running home with diarrhea either.  If this place were located closer to better mexican options then I'd probably give them 3 stars, but since its the best in the area I'll grant them another one.    TL;DR: Eat here if you're on the NW side and want tex-mex.

Not a bad store, but they don't open until 8am.  Wtf?  If you need to pick anything up in the morning before you go to work, make sure you go to wal-mart instead.  Everything else is pretty standard for Target.  Fairly clean, staff is nicer than wal-mart.  Never shop here for food.  Go to Sprouts or Safeway instead.

Probably the best restaurant I've found in Glendale.  It is a nice change of pace from the chain restaurants in the area.  I've been here 4 or 5 times since I moved here and always had the same thing.  I keep telling myself I'll eat something other than the empanadas, tamales, and arepas; but they're so good that I can't stop myself from ordering them.    I wasn't very impressed with the ceviche.  You get a huge serving of it, but there was way too much acidity for my taste.    The restaurant is small, and service isn't very fast.  But it's owned by a husband and wife with the husband taking care of the front of house and the wife cooking, and they are super nice.  I will definitely be back!

Expensive, but good.  Go for the ambiance, but stay for the food.  The patio is wonderful, it never got too hot even though it was the middle of the afternoon; but then again I didnt come in the middle of july when being outside is the equivalent of living in an oven.  If it gets too hot, just order another drink.  They come in a nice sized glass and are plenty strong.  Bring friends, drink a lot, and have a good time.

Everytime I'm in Tempe I have to stop here.  The white bread is delicious.  The flan is amazing.  The curry-pan (curry filled bread) is almost as good as what you buy in Japan.  The cakes are expensive, but the quality is so much better than what you get at a grocery store.  If you're traveling within 10 miles of this place, do yourself a favor and stop here.  Your stomach will thank you =)

Good, quick, reasonably priced Thai food on the west side of Phoenix.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a thai restaurant.  Service is nice, food is pretty standard Thai with all the classics.  This restaurant is more of a convenience factor for me than anything, but if you live on the west side and crave Thai food then you could definitely do worse.

Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.    It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.

My girlfriend and I came to Binkley's during restaurant week to celebrate our 3 year anniversary, and see if Binkley's lived up to everything we've heard about it.  Binkley's exceeded my already high expectations.  Incredible food, knowledgeable and friendly service, and an intimate atmosphere make Binkley's a visit to remember.  The restaurant week menu provided a multi-course (7 or 8 dishes) menu that delights the palette.  The foam pea vichyssoise with wasabi infused salmon roe was particularly delicious.  Binkley's takes a refined, modern approach to classic dishes and uses molecular gastronomy in exciting ways to play with textures and flavors.  The small restaurant only has about 8 or 9 tables inside, as well as a small patio outside so you definitely want to make reservations.  If you can't make it during restaurant week, then the tasting menu is probably the way to go since you can experience all that Binkley's has to offer.  While expensive, the food and service is well worth the money; and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special night out, or any foodie who enjoys molecular gastronomy at its best.  I will most definitely be back!

Good coffee, decent prices, love the atmosphere.  Only complaint was that the Wi-Fi is a bit spotty.  I found a new study spot =)

I've been coming here pretty regularly for the past couple months. I've only had my suit dry cleaned here so I can't speak about anything else, but they've always done a good with that. They have a discount for Midwestern students, which brings the price down to $2.25 per item. They charge $0.50 for debit so make sure you bring cash.

Great portion sizes for the price.  Buy one gyro or dinner plate here and you got food for 2 meals.  The food is decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  I come here mostly because its convenient.  Value = 3 stars Taste = 2.5 stars +1 star because they give a discount to students from Midwestern University

I'd give 5 stars to this place just for the sloppy joe.  It is probably the best sloppy joe I've had in my life.  I had the opportunity to sample their sloppy joe at Binkley's and I was hooked after trying the tiny baby sized portion they gave me there.  When I learned that Cafe Bink served a full size portion, I knew I'd be visiting.    I came to Cafe Bink for happy hour, and being the only patrons at the bar my girlfriend and I got wonderful service, and the food came out real quick.  The french fries were good, but I don't know that the truffle ketchup was as good as others on here have made it out to be.  I'm pretty sure we ordered everything on the happy hour menu, and it was all pretty tasty.  But that damn sloppy joe was soo good, I even ordered a second one for dessert.  I'm pretty sure that just makes me a fat@ss, and I was really straining to finish that second one, but it was worth the pain.    My advice: come for the sloppy joe, stay for the sloppy joe, and leave with a sloppy joe.  It's worth it.

I can't really compare this to other filipino food, because I haven't really eaten any.  The extent of my knowledge on filipino food is what I've learned from filipino nurses at the hospital, and Balut is not on my bucket list of things to try....But anytime I get grilled spam with eggs and rice, served on styrofoam plates and TV's showing a filipino beauty pagent you know this food is either going to taste freakin delicious or give you diarrhea for a week.  Luckily for me it was the former.  Great food, and the halo-halo special for dessert shouldn't be passed up.  One day I'll work up the courage to try the food by the checkout counter, but....baby steps.  Don't worry I'll be back.  P.S. They got karaoke is the back.

I was new to yoga and decided to buy a 10 class pass to attend yoga since this studio is right across the street from my school.  At the time I purchased the package they never informed me that the classes expired.  I got really busy with the school year and was only able to attend a few of the classes.  It had been several months since the last time I attended a class, and when I showed up they informed me that I did not have any classes remaining.  I assured them that I did, in fact I should have 6 classes remaining, but they were extremely dismissive and told me the pass must have expired.  I will never go to this studio again, and I intend to tell everyone at my school that they steal your money.  With as much school loans as I have, I cant afford to give my money to a sleazy yoga studio.

After looking at air duct cleaning deals on groupon and living social, I noticed that everyone that has used those services complained of a really hard upsell and poor quality of work.  I opted to look for a different company that would clean the air ducts and dryer vent and would be upfront about their prices.  That search brought me to honest air duct.  They were very accommodating with my schedule (willing to come after 5 pm) and are very upfront about the costs.  $10 per vent, $35 for the dryer, and a slight travel charge.  The cleaning process took a bit over 2 hours and lance did a great job; going out of his way to make sure all the air vents were properly positioned and the house was maximizing airflow.  There was no upsell and lance was very professional.  I'm glad I decided to pay a little more to make sure the job was done right.  I would recommend this service to my friends and family.

I came here during my lunch break to check out the lunch buffet.  For $7.99 this place is a great deal.  It's very typical for what you expect from a chinese buffet, most everything I had was decent with nothing being particularly memorable.  A couple things I didn't like, but it's a buffet...you just leave it on the plate.  The food quality gets 3 stars.  The cheap price gives it another star.  If you're in the mood for a chinese buffet, you can't go wrong at this place.

Since I live pretty close by and I've been to most of the sushi places in the area, I thought I'd pop in and give M sushi bar a try.  The place just opened up a week or two ago, so they are still figuring out the logistics.  The ambiance is really nice, its not fancy and its not a big restaurant; but it is well thought out.  I liked the Japanese paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  The service wasn't great; they only had one girl that was acting as the hostess, waitress, and busser for the whole place when we came in.  A second waitress came in later before we left. But because the place is new and they're still figuring things out; I'm willing to give them a pass on the service considering it was just her and she was running around all over the place.    *FYI: their liquor license hasn't come in yet, so you can't get an alcoholic drink there for at least a couple weeks.    The food was pretty good.  The sushi chefs were nice, and the fish was a pretty good quality.  The rolls are reasonably priced compared to the other places in this area, and the chicken cutlet dinner entree was tasty.  I'm a bit picky about my sushi, especially the quality of the fish; and M's is some of the better fish in the area.    I didn't notice any problems with the bathroom like one of the previous reviewers.  All in all it is a nice restaurant and well worth checking out if you are in the mood for some Japanese food.  I will definitely come back to try it out again, but I plan on waiting a few weeks until they get their liquor license and they get a few more staff.

Chef Johnny Chu knows how to make asian fusion.  The dumplings are some of the best dumplings I've had, either in the states or in Asia.  I love the tapas menu, and while its not all good; for the money it's hard to miss.  They do groupons pretty regularly so keep an eye out for that.  The drinks are overpriced, but strong.  I had one martini and felt pretty good by the time I left.    The service could use a little work.  It took the servers a long time to refill drinks or just stop by our table so we could place our order.  The restaurant has never been busy when I've been there, so I'm not sure why the service is so slow.    I would definitely recommend this place to my friends, and be sure to get the dumplings!

This was my first time visiting both the market and the cafe.  I loved the atmosphere of the place.  A bit hipster in design, but not obnoxious.  The staff is super friendly and they let you sample the beer they have on tap before you buy!  The food was great.  I got the pork chile verde pot pie, and it was delicious. Just eating the crust of that pie will hit your calorie limit for the day, but damn its worth it.  I wish phoenix had more places like this.  Being able to walk around the farmers market afterwards was a definite bonus.

This is one of those places that you walk in, look at their menu, and think "everything looks freakin amazing."  But then you eat the food and you realize you've been lied to. This is essentially the same concept as paradise bakery or panera bread, and you'd be better off going to either of those. The soup was bland, the salad dressings too sweet, and the sandwiches are slightly better than subway.    The service was great though.  Very nice employees.  But still...go somewhere else

My roommate told me I had to try Nepal food, and apparently this is the place to do it.  Holy crap is this place a great value.  If Nepali food isn't your cup of tea, they have chinese and indian food as well (I haven't had a chance to try those yet).  As other people have said the momo dumplings are worth trying (you get around 10-12 for $5) and you could probably make your meal out of just that.  The mango lassi might be the best lassi I've ever had.   The decor could use a little updating, but you're here for the food. Service was good and the food came out very quickly.  The place is also BYOB.  Subba is a hidden gem and worth checking out.

Holy crap...good pizza in northwest Phoenix.     It figures that this place opens just a few months before I leave the state.  We've been a fan of Pomo every since we tried them at their downtown location, and I've been anxiously waiting for Pomo to open ever since my girlfriend told me they were adding a location here.  Pomo is only the second pizza place in Phoenix (that I've seen) that serves authentic certified Neapolitan style pizza.  That means the dough is crispy on the outside and a bit wet on the inside. Absolutely delightful.  We got the parmigiana pizza and the carbonara pizza. Both were exceptional.  The eggplant was perfectly fried and the balance between the cheese and sauce and meat was perfect. The egg on the carbonara made it taste like a very delicate quiche.  But not all good stories can be perfect. While the pizza was exceptional and I love the ambiance of the restaurant, the appetizers left a little to be desired. The fried calamari and shrimp was decent but overpriced, and the Caesar salad was just "meh."  They have a nice beer selection, but the wine selection could stand to be expanded a little bit.  All that ending said, no one goes to a pizzeria for the Caesar salad.  Come for the pizza, and you won't regret your decision. It makes me happy that we're getting good, non-chain restaurants on this side of the valley, and it's clear that I'm not the only one with this sentiment because this place was packed.
