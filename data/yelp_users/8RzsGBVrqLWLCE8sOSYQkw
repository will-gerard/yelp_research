Somewhere, beneath layers of flacid, white skin, I am a black man.   Though I cannot readily identify with years of oppression, white women crossing the street when I pass for no good reason and the spectre of slavery, I think that my love of motown, broad-hipped women and soul food makes me, at the least, an honorary brother.     Strangely, and perhaps because of hunger, the best BBQ pork sandwich I ever had was dolled out to me as I hurriedly boarded a plane in Nasville, TN.   I've dined all across America and even in Memphis itself and I've tasted some fine BBQ and contrary to other reviewers here, I thought HB BBQ was a-ok.     I was feeling depressed last night, the unfortunate consequence of some protracted litigation I'm involved in and I got a hankering for slow-cooked meat slathered in tangy bbq sauce and my craving guided the wheel as I drove to HB's.      It still looks like an IHOP.  They've changed the booths and moved some things around, but the decor has a definite "International House of Barbeque" feel to it.   I must also admit that I was more than a little dismayed when 3 hispanic guys made my bbq pork sandwich.  What in all the red tamales do hispanic folks know about BBQ?  Call me picky, but when I get something called Honey Bear BBQ with a song of the south lookin bear on the sign, I expect a large black man or woman with a disarming smile to sling my pork and slaw together on a paper plate--the way god intended.   Perhaps I'm missing out on all the great latin BBQ, but I've long believed that after all the suffering God forced upon my brothers, he tried to make penance by imbuing them with rhythm, soul and bbq knowledge.  Nonetheless, the sandwich was tasty.  I would have liked a spicy sauce option, but I'll take what I can get.  It's not deep south bbq and it's probably not even like Mom's, even if your mom was irish and grew up in poughkipsie, but it's at least pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  It's Phoenixand 50 degrees in the dead of winter.  We take what we can get.

Normally pithy nicknames and a vegetarian friendly mission statement scares this carniverous reviewer off.   Usually the wit bespeaks hippy cliche and the veggy-weirdo friendly menu ensures I'll struggle to find anything that once moo'd and if I do, it will taste like processed rubber.  Not so at "That's a Wrap."  My wife describes this adorable wrap shop as being one which makes both her inner slut and inner fat girl happy.  It allowed her to eat good food until she was full without feeling guilty about ruining her diet.   She enjoyed the my sherry amore.  I enjoyed the Rocky VII, basically a cheesesteak wrap.  Both were excellent.  The pasta salad was pedestrian but decent and the fresh fruit salad was spectacularly fresh.     Very reasonably priced and an aesthetically pleasing interior.   Parking is a bitch though a serious problem if you go during a busy time like the lunch hour.  Have someone who can parralel park do the driving.

Prior to dining there, I was unaware that they are the same company as the Good Egg.   Of course, had I known, I would have driven a stake through my eye rather than dine here.   This is because, as the previous reviewer noted, dining at the good egg is like playing chess with yourself:  The sort of thing you do only in times of absolute desperation.  Given that, my expectations withered to McDonalds levels once I sat down and figured out about its nefarious affiliation.   However, I was mostly pleasantly surprised, a feat which isn't hard since the bar was set somewhere below sea level.   I had a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  The cheese was a tasty brie and the bread a thick and fluffy sourdough.   The eggs were bland and shitty (read: from a can) but the bacon and cheese made up for it.     At 7.50 for the sandwich, it's far from a bargain but it wasn't a complete waste of money.  The service sucked as my server struggled to refill my soda just once.   When she finally did (well after dropping our check) she did at least put it in a to-go cup.  I like the message implicit there--"get the fuck out," don't you?  Skip this one and go to Denny's at least the suckage won't surprise you there.

I judge a restaurant by its burger.   The burger is a perfect measuring stick for every-day dining establishments; It is sold almost everywhere and does not rely on special ingredients and is always a good barometer of a kitchen's capacity for meeting your temperature needs.    That said, I have enjoyed the American Kobe burger here several times and it is consistently above-average and frequently quite excellent.   My wife has enjoyed the wrap and several other sandwiches and remains pleased.   We also enjoy the spinach and artichoke appetizer.   The wings are average at best but the kettle chips with chipotle ketchup rules.    Oh, and they have 1000 island.  But what matters is the beer and the porter and cream ale are both splendid if a bit  too sharp initially.  The server are pleasant and the place has a small, family atmosphere.   It's also reasonably priced.

I am a fan of Luke's from my youth in Tucson, where they provided a nearby source of yummu chicago dogs and bigger-than-average burgers.   Let's be honest, the burgers are decent but unremarkable.  They are, at least, consistent in their mediocrity.  Luke's can't hold a candle to Delux or the Sonora Brewery, but they are definitely cheaper, likely closer and they've a down-home feel.  The customer service was fantastic and incredibly friendly.  I definitely felt very welcome and the atmosphere was warm, even if they muttered about my Red Sox stomping the White Sox on the t.v. and changed it because they couldn't bear to watch.  hah!

This is the dirtiest and mostly disorganized Best Buy I've ever been to.   Today it took some girl in customer service 10 minutes to look up whether they had a PC game I wanted.  As it turns out, the game hits shelves tomorrow, not today, but I had to go to 5 stores to figure that out.  The folks at Best Buy said they would not carry it, which is hilarious since I know they'll carry it since it's an expansion pack for a top-selling game they have on the shelves.  In the words of Napolean Dynamite: "Gosh, idiot."

I've never seen so many fat, ugly people working in one place and all of them doing nothing.  Yet another store that claims to carry PC games but couldn't tell me when or if ever they would carry a major-market PC game expansion.  This is my 2nd trip there, the last time they tried to sell me a laptop with Vista despite a quick explanation that we were just trying to see if they had any XP inventory.    Ug.

Jamba juice would be the happist place on earth but for two problems:  1.) The sound of six blenders working in overdrive simultaneously makes my brain bleed and,  2.) The Bunny Ranch is the happiest place on earth.   As JJ's go, this one is typically clean and staffed with the typical compliment of perky teen-agers all reeking of over-ripe fruit.   Is it expensive for a smoothie?  Hell yeah.  Is it probably out of your way in the morning? Yeah (unless you're a poor shmuck and work at the McDonalds next door).  Are you going to make smoothies on your own using  4 different fruits and orange sherbert complete with nebulously defined "boosts?"    Fuck no.     Drop the $5 and get a smoothie from Jamba.   Jambo means hello, but Jamba means corporate health-craze capitalism.  Hip, Hip.....hooray.

My heart is mostly hard, particularly in places where the arteries have closed and the ventricles seized around a blockage of unknown fatty matter.   I'm fairly certain that I will die before age 40, of some hard-hearted condition related to my perpetual consumption of fatty foods.   For this reason it is perhaps ironic that the one soft spot in my otherwise much-maligned heart is for hot dogs and burgers cooked over an open flame.   It's no surprise then that I'll be going back to Ted's.  Like a phillistine, I had a chesseburger but it was tasty.  The onion rings are also good, much more to my taste than traditional O-rings.     Long lines and no ranch makes for 4, rather than 5 stars.  But the staff was friendly, the food priced right and the ambiance fun and lively.  I definitely recommend Ted's.

The Orange Blossom Papago micro-brew is a pint-sized orgasm complete with violent shaking, left leg twitching and screaming out the Lord's name.   If I were doing marketing for Papago, I would adopt an ad campaign centered around the orange blossom:  "Orange Blossom, it'll keep you coming (back)."  I also enjoyed the Oregon-made Rogue Brown Ale.   I've never had it on draft, but it rules.  Papago is very reasonably priced and has some tasty, high-carb appetizers.  I enjoyed the wings, pretzels and beer bites.   They were all good but not amazing.  Four stars rather than five since they don't serve burgers.  What brewery doesn't serve burgers?  I don't know the answer...because I'm still hung-over.  God bless the orange blossom, my legs are weak still.

Honest to god the best beef cheese steak in America.  Philly has nothing on DeFalco's.    Superb chicken caesar pasta salad.    Friendly, competent staff.   Great grocery.  All three color Chimay beers for sale.  Gnocchi is excellent.

I was a sushi virgin and based on the reviews this was probably the wrong place to pop my cherry.  But I did and it was simply alright.  I had the california rolls which were edible and I ate the entire thing.  I smothered them in soy sauce and focused on the rice.   The only problem was it was really dark and I thought the dollop of wasabi was a stray slice of avocado so my first bite was an entire mouthful of wasabi which made me nearly double over in mouth-searing agony.  I flailed frantically until I found my beer which I promptly inhaled as a means of quenching the tartar-esque inferno raging in my mouth.   After I quenched it, I managed to choke down the rest of the rice, avocado and partially uncooked fish.  The sum of my experience is the unshakable notion that people don't really like sushi.  It's not as good as real fish and it's dangerous and more than a little creepy.  I think this is one of those foods you pretend to like in order to seem cool.  But, hey, I'm just a burger guy.  The service was great, my waittress pleasant and the vibe pretty cool for a cheesey college scene.  Plus the Sunday happy hour is very reasonably priced.

Wraps and Smoothies! There's a novel concept!!! **slams head into table**.   A so-so wrap with so-so customer service and no bathrooms.   With all the gitchy colors it looked like a set from the production of the 90s T.V. show "Parker Lewis Can't Lose."    Try again.

What the hell is a Dilly?  Dill is a pickle, and there's Piccadilly, both the circus and the old folks buffet.  Is Dilly a person?  Is Dilly some ante-bellum dance?   Whatever a dilly is, it's also a very high quality restaurant.   Dilly's features exceptionally fine bread and Boar's head meats.   Admittedly, the sandwiches and wraps they offer really aren't my cup of tea, but the southwestern club I had was chock-full of quality ingredients and service was prompt and cheerful.   I also enjoyed the cream of broccoli soup in a breadbowl.   I've had better breadbowls and definitely had better soup, but everything seemed fresh and the place was packed so I'm tempted to think my pallete may just be unrefined.      With wraps, sandwiches, 4 kinds of sides (namely ridiculously fresh and tasty fruit) and half sandwich/salad/soup options Dilly's is a great lunch tim get-away.

I'm giving CM's two stars because despite the fact that the beer was decent and the food mostly tasty, I was so immensely turned off when I had to listen to the "we really don't do separate checks" speech from our server.   We were a party of 8 engaging in light drinking and mostly appetizers.   This was not culinary calculus.    I've served.  I've served parties ranging in size from 1-63.   Never, ever has it been a problem giving people separate checks, even 63 of them.   You teach your party to be patient but give them what they want.  "We aren't really supposed to do separate checks" is your way or signifying to me that you're lazy or stupid, with neither being a quality I want from a server.     Fried food, burgers, wraps and seafood are a dime a dozen.  What makes a restaurant standout is how welcoming it is, pardon the cheesey reference, but how much like Cheers it is.   The first step in the journey to earning loyal customers if service and whining about separate checks is no step forward--it's a backflip.

The Barrio Cafe is a fucking unreal dining experience; But at first glance, you'd never know it.   Barrio is a tastefully decorated, two-room restaurant located in a predominately hispanic area in central Phoenix just off of Thomas and 16th St.    Normally I would never recommend a restaurant located next to a 99-cent store, but Barrio Cafe is a rare and treasured exception.    My wife and I went with friends who were regulars and gracious enough to pick up the hefty tab.   Our friends described the cuisine as French-Mexican fusion cuisine, a term I happily blended into the cheerily trite "Frexican."   In realty, I'm not sure that I detected the French elements.  Sufficed to say, the food does adopt a central Mexican, colonial flair.   If I were liken the type of cuisine to any previous experience, it is most like that of the Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson though with a less traditional feel.     Barrio has an extensive and seemingly well-formed wine list which I did not personally avail myself of.  I enjoyed a smooth and tasty import beer called Sol.   As a side note, I strongly recommend Sol to anyone who likes Tecate but feels bad about drinking Mexican swill.   Sol is to Tecate as Allison Krauss is to Dolly Parton--All the same fun without the white trash guilty feeling when you're done.   We enjoyed a delightful Guacamole and chips appetizer.  Though still chock-full of advocados and the accompanying calories, Barrio's guac-fare also boasts nuts and apples and some other unexpected ingredients which lend the guac a sweet and light flavor that makes you feel like you're eating healthy whilst clogging your arteries, a ruse I always appreciate.      For dinner I enjoyed their filet mingon which was served with a goat cheese and crab meat topping on a bed of well-prepared red peppers and other ingredients I just cannot recall.  In addition to preparing the meat as ordered (MR), Barrios beef was flavorful and tender as one would expect from the Filet.   I devoured this.   I was hungry and it was so incredibly tasty I didn't do a good job of savoring, I just inhaled it.    We enjoyed a churro with whipped cream for dessert.   A churro.   Yes, a churro.   What can I say except: Churro?  Fuck Yeah!  Seriously...go.   But, bring your credit card because you'll average $30/head without even drinking.   Budget on 50-60/head if you're drinking.

Raspberry Lambic.   Did you hear me?  Raspberry Lambic?  It's a burger joint with all the class and style of a downtown jazz club located in a strip mall across the street from a gelato shop.  It's a marriage of convenience to an ugly girl who really knows how to work it.    The best things about Delux are its burgers and fries.  The fries, sweet potato and regular, are crisp, salty and delicious.  They are served in miniature shopping carts with the D for Delux emblazoned on the front.  Our server adorably quipped "Fries A La Cart."  Heh...heh....ehhhhh.....they still tasted good.   The burgers are properly cooked to order and the meat is flavorful and satisfying.   I've been twice now and have yet to be disappointed.   My only beef (pun intended) with Delux is the lack of 1000 island dressing for my burger (I'm white trash like that).   However, the aioli which is spicy but still smooth makes up for the lack of 1000 as a substitute condiment.     The beer list is extensive and the menus are adorable.  The outside patio is misted and looks out onto a nice view...well, for a road-side strip mall at least.  If you go during peak hours, expect a wait.   It's reasonably priced but still a $15/head trip.

I've been two Pie-Zanos twice now and I think my wife did the best job of describing the format of this unique dining experience:  Subway for Pizza.  Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing "pizza artists" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this "Subway of Pizza" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza.   Pie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings you'll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you don't go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.     I have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto.   My only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow children's birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheese's.

It's McDonald's: How do you fuck up McDonald's?  Easy--hire no one who speaks English, consistently serve cold and stale french fries and generally let the store be filthy.   I'm so glad I live in the quasi-ghetto!

I once had an ex-girlfriend (a series, really) who told me that she couldn't love me because some things are just too small to satisfy you.   I'm not sure what she meant, but it definitely wasn't the burgers at Stax.   Stax's 3oz slider-style burgers are a 2-bite size slice of burger heaven.   Being able to choose from Salmon, Beef, Turkey, Buffalo, Lamb and other meats is amazing.  You can put anything you want and the burgers are small enough that you can try a couple of different combinations.     For the record, I figured out why the white man killed all of the buffaloes as he swept across the plaints:  It's goddamned tasty!  Seriously, if I'd known buffalo was this good I would've rented dances with wolves like 2 weeks ago.     The service rocked and the bar is nicely stocked.   Well done.....chic Scottsdale crowd but if you can stand the hokey wanna be rich and cool vibe of the crowd you'll be rewarded with a great meal.
