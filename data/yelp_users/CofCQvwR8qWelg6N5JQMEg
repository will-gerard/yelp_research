My coworkers highly recommended this delivery service, so I had to try it. I must say, I was not disappointed. I ordered the Turkey Panini, and it arrived to me still steaming. As a side, I tried the potato salad-- which was also very tasty. Next time, I'm ordering breakfast. The omelets look delicious!

Best Mexican food on the West side, hands down. I usually order the chicken tacos and they never disappoint.

Great food, fast service! Love this place. We originally came here for ropa vieja and ended up ordering a few things of of their menu--- all of which were delicious! FIVE STARS.

We've been meaning to try this place for a while and are really disappointed. Right off the bat, we were sat at the tiniest table, which happened to be next to a large table full of people, and were extremely cramped. We let that go and went on to look at the menu. My girlfriend ended up ordering a chicken sandwich, which was the worst chicken sandwich either of us had ever had. I'm not sure if they use frozen chicken or really what happened, but this was so rubbery that it was practically inedible. I, on the other hand, had the Cajun burger which was pretty good (hence, the two star and not one star rating). We will not be going back.

**UPDATE** After the owner of Hula's reached out and asked us to give it another go, we went back and had a much better experience. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and the Cajun burger, which were both delicious. Big thanks to Hula's for taking the time to contact us :)

Yum!! We came here after reading other good reviews, and it did not disappoint. I had a veggie Hola Amigo (avocado, cream cheese, special sauce and jalape√±os) and a beef Cowboy (their version of a chili cheese dog) and they were supreme. Definitely coming back!
