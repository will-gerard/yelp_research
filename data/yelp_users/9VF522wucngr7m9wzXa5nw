Living in Scottsdale and commuting to Chandler for work everyday, I think I have eaten from the nices Latin restaurants (Distrito) to the hole in the ground (yes, not wall) ones.    Los Taquitos has to be my favorite of all from top to bottom.  Walking in, I got the feeling I was in San Luis RC or Rocky point joint.  There's enough seating for a lunch crowd and a few outdoor seats when it gets crowded (or too cold inside).    I ordered the Combo plate which came with three meats, beans, and rice.  I also got a side salsa, and I made a quick grab for the usual red salsa in a bottle.    The three meats were flavorful and distinct.  I liked the beef which had a nice char to it.  The beans were the usual, but the rice was amazing.  It looks normal, but it was buttery, soft, and melted in your mouth.  The side salsa they give you is also a standout.  It was very fresh with a hint of sweetness to it which I'm wondering if it could be a pickled melon?  Hands down it's the place to go when I get a craving for Mexican food in the East Valley.

What happened Baja Fresh??  There was a time where I couldn't fully distinguish between Rubio's and Baja Fresh other than the green salsa they had.  I liked both equally well.  I grabbed a quick lunch from Baja fresh a few days ago.. and was immediately shocked as I came in.  They covered up all the calorie numbers on the menu, suspect. Also, the mahi fish tacos were now called "wahoo" fish tacos.  I usually ordered two crispy fish tacos, so I did the same.  The dread I felt when I saw them.  The fish used to be the size of something you would get at a pub when you ordered fish and chips.  It's now the size of a fish stick.  Yes.. a fish stick!!!  Looks like a fish stick, tastes like a fish stick.. It was ridiculous.  I'm now a Rubio's guy for life now when looking for some quick fish tacos.

Cowboy Ciao used to be a spot I went to about 8 or 9 years ago.  I decided to go there again due to nostalgia reasons, and it didn't live up to my expectations at all.    To start off, the food was not as great as it used to be.  The scallops had a sour after taste to them which I attributed to being in the smoker way too long, and they needed a better sear.  The wild boar meatballs needed more seasoning. The duck confit relleno was pretty good, but the batter was oily and fell right off the chile.  Next off, we got seated in the brightly lit room to the left as you walk in.  The room resembles nothing of the ambiance of the rest of the place.  I was turned off by the faux wall artwork.  The waitress seemed rush every time she came to us, and it showed with her missing our mushroom pan fry order.  It's hard to explain what it was like being there.  Have you ever gone to a restaurant, and you just wanted to leave after being there for 10 minutes?  Bad service, so so food, and being in a room that reminded me of the olive garden leads to wholly bad experience.  With so many other good restaurants such as NOCA, FNB, Herb Box near by, I won't ever recommend this place to anyone again.

Dropped in on a Saturday night and ate indoors.  I understand when people say about getting a table,  but I am used to this service at Asian places.  I just flagged down the first person I saw and asked where I could sit.  There have been lots of reviews on what the restaurant looks like, so I'm going straight to the food.  We ordered the chimichangas and enchiladas.  The salsa that came with the chips was okay.  It could've used some cilantro to brighten it up.  The two entrees was nothing special.  Rice was a little dry, beans okay.  The chimi had a lot of beef in it, but the sauce was not that great.  The enchiladas were flimsy and drenched in this forgettable poblano cream sauce.  I thought the food was.. well like the rating says meh.  I wouldn't recommend anyone going there if they have a kick for Mexican food.  There are plenty of other places around that taste better.  For upscale, I'd try Spotted Donkey or Mission.  For something a little more relaxed, just take scottsdale south, and there'll be Los Sombreros on the right side.

Armed with my groupon I scoured the Yelp reviews.  Some was positive and a lot was negative.  Walking into the place, I feel like I'm in somebody's home... Just somebodys home I didn't want to be.  Gordon Ramsey would have a field day on Kitchen Nightmares with the place.  The best part is walking in and to the left is the dining room, and to the right had a handwritten sign that said VIP ROOM.  The older lady was very nice.  She seated us in a mostly empty restaurant but greeted with a warm smile.  I wish she would've gone over the menu a little more.  We ordered larb na, curry noodles, and yellow curry.  We didn't realize the curry noodles and yellow curry were the same thing except one had noodles and the other rice.  The larb na was fresh and full of flavor.  I really enjoyed it.  I wish they would've added toasted rice like most place would.  Also, I was hoping for cabbage used to scoop the larb na into.  Instead, there was this soggy lettuce underneath the larb that was drenched in lime & fish sauce.  The curry was okay.  I know I could make a better curry at home and in about 5 minutes too which was a shame.    What really weirded me out like other yelpers was the tv.  She had wheel of fortune on one tv.  At another table, there was this portable dvd player playing kenny g.  The best part was the older lady was sitting there browsing the web.  I hope groupon doesn't slay this place, but even if I had another one, I think I will pass.

Love love the service at Eddie's House.  We came in here on a Friday night around 7 expecting to wait for a seat at the bar but was surprised it was at quarter capacity.  As we sat down, the bartender gave us a great run through of their every day happy hour specials.  We got the stuffed shrimp, hummus, charred calamari, and tuna tartare nachos.  The shrimp and hummus was delicious.  The charred calamari was not what I was expecting, but it was spicy and tender.    The only downfall was the tartare.  It had this weird texture to it, and I didn't like the tortilla strips embedded in it.  Their happy hour is $5 vodka drinks, $6 wines, and half off all appetizers except for the steak tartare.  The service was exemplary with the staff giving us suggestions and constantly checking on us without being overbearing.  I really enjoyed my night here and will definitely be back.

I've been here a lot, but I've always had the broken rice dish.  I brought my parents here while they were visiting to get their take on it.    The broken rice dishes are all great.  The menu might look giant, but all the dishes are just slight variations of each other.  If you had broken rice with about 11 different things you can get on it... just imagine the different variations of menu items you can write.    My dad had the bi suon ta hu ky which is shredded pork, pork chop, and a tofu skin wrap filled with shrimp.  He really liked it and said it reminded him of something that he would get in northern cali.  My mom and I ordered dishes that are really hard to find at other restaurants.  She had these little rice vermicelli pattie noodles with some pork and a fish sauce topping.  She said the vermicelli was a little dry, but the pork was really good.  I had the banh canh which is an udon like noodle in a  a light pork broth.  The broth was really good.  I think it's better than the one next door (unphogettable).  If you look at the broth, it's crystal clear which is something that's hard to do.    Pricing is really fair with around 7.99 a dish that would have anyone walking away really full.  I give it only 4 stars, because the tea situation really weirds me out.  They pour tea in a tall glass that would be used for water.  The glass was really hot, and it cooled down really quickly.  My mom even asked if they had a pot of tea, and they said no.  She said a pot of tea would stay warm longer and taste a lot better.  Overall I would definitely come here and eat anytime while I'm grocery shopping.  I've actually made my way to this place after a long night of drinking to cure the blues.

Hands down, the best Pho in Arizona.  Do I dare say that it's better than my mom's???? (dodging lightning strikes now)  My friends and I call it Taco Bell Pho, since it looks like an old taco bell.  The food is amazing, the service is horrible, and the prices are awesome.  I've been going here, since I moved from Chicago ten years ago.    What to order?  Look at the Pho list and pick the most expensive thing, and you'll know your pho will have every thing and more in it.  If you're afraid of tripe or some other ingredients, go with the Bo Vien.  The true test was when my parents came here to visit me, and she also told me this was the best pho she's had in AZ.

I have been craving for a Carribean restaurant near my work place for a while.  I've heard of Ocean Blue for a while but never made it there.  My friend Howie tried the buffet and said it was okay.  We decided to come back and order off the menu.   We got one of each Jamaican pattie on the menu: curry chicken, jerk chicken, beef, and spinach.  They were flaky but sitting in the warmer for a while.  The curry chicken was the most flavorful of the bunch.  Next we got the jerk chicken sandwich and jerk turkey burger.  Howie mentioned the turkey burger tasted like it was homemade.  My burger was okay, but the chicken was dry.  For the price of $5.95 / burger, it seems a bit steep for lunch.  The owner did give us festivals on the side for free.  We weren't really sure what a festival was, but it seemed to be deep friend semi-sweet dough.  Service was a bit slow with us waiting for refills and the check.  Overall, the meal was okay.  I've had better, especially at Breadfruit in downtown Phoenix.  I probably won't be back unless I get a deep craving for jerk chicken at work.

I went here for dim sum with my parents who are visiting from northern cali on a Sunday.  I wanted to get their take on it.  Before this place, China King down in Chandler was always my favorite dim sum place.  They had a great variety, the dim sum was not greasy, and the service was decent.  Mekong Palace does what China King does but even better.  There are more varieties of dim sum to choose from.  The restaurant is also a lot bigger and much cleaner with their tile floor.  China King's carpet has gotten really dirty over the past few years.  The usual chicken feet, har gow, siu mai, chow fun, and congee, which are my standards, are excellent here.  Also every time I go, I always seem to find some new item I've never tried before.  Price wise, it's as cheap as it can get.  With 4 people eating all the dim sum they can and hot tea, I think the bill is usually $40-$50 total.  To top it off, you can go grocery shopping next door after you're done or grab a boba tea at the taiwan cafe in the mall.  My parents said the dim sum was pretty close, if not equal, to what they get in the bay.  Definitely my favorite dim sum place in the valley, and I've been to  cfu, china king, phoenix palace, golden buddha, and great wall.

I am usually a person who sticks to Old Town or Arcadia/Biltmore when it comes to going out to eat due to where all my friends and I live.  I had to go north to run some errands, and a friend and I decided to check out the McCormick Ranch plaza.  I have to say it's changed a lot, since I've last been here.  There's Butters breakfast spot, busters, Zipps, and I think Jade Palace got replaced by TCBY.  My friend already ate at Busters, so we decided to go to Spotted Donkey.  I was amazed by the decor when I first stepped in.  It felt like the first time I walked into Modern Steak or J & G Steakhouse.  It was different, modern, yet had a nice casual vibe to it.  A modern latin decor with hints of burnt orange surrounded the area.  We decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by a pleasant bartender.  We had a couple of beers and tried out the ceviche which was fresh and vibrant.  We also split the nachos which was not the kind I was expecting.  The nachos had a lot of flavor on large tortilla chips.  I wish it had a more spicy kick to it, but I usually lean towards spicy than others.  The beers were around $6, but they were giant size.  We had a great time sitting around and catching up with some other friends who joined later.  I really like the service, scenery, and food.  I'll definitely do another followup review when I come back to try out the dinner entrees.

We came to Casablanca on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday.  We thought it would be a good starting place, since it was more a lounge then a lounge/nightclub and somewhere new.  The positives were being able to talk to my friends without yelling.  The staff almost had a pin-up style look to them which gave a unique style to the place.  Drink prices are average, but the selection of Scotch's were spectacular.  The music was great playing a lot of classics we haven't heard in a while.  It was busy, but not packed. The menus had a nice lit up LCD screen that made them unique.  With that in mind, it couldn't keep us there for a long time.  The bar was very bright making the cozy atmosphere almost seem sterile.  The bar staff took forever to serve my friends, and it just wasn't one person.  A guy friend had to go to one side of the bar and a girl friend had to go to another to see who could get service first, and it wasn't even busy.  The music, albeit great, was old school hip-hop played in a classy bar with the staff dressed to form.  It'd be like going to a Chinese restaurant and listening to salsa music.  For now, I think I'd rather just hang out at Olive and Ivy and look over to see if Casablanca has gotten any better.

Found Flict on Yelp about 6 months back.  It's been great ever since.  The staff is really nice.  I come here every two weeks to get a haircut from Brandi.  She somehow got me a hipster haircut that was okay for my corporate job.  Finally decided to put in a review.  I was stuck in Austria for work for over 6 weeks.  I love my hair and trying to get a haircut and only knowing enough German to order food was daunting.  First thing I did after coming back was seeing Brandi for a cut!

I tried asking some other Yelpers one morning if they liked this place more than Tao Garden.  I've always liked Tao Garden the most in Chandler area, but the Long John Silvers decore of old was a little too much to handle after a while.  I came to Szechwan Garden with a friend, and I saw the noticeable change in the decor.  It was previously iKitchen (korean/ramen).  iKitchen didn't do much to change the look from the TOGO that was there before them.  Szechwan Garden added touches of red with lanterns.  They changed the tables into the classic round table with red cloth we see at most asian restaurants.  Though there were plenty of free tables, we somehow got stuck with the two seater next to the bathroom.  I wish we could've sat elsewhere, but I assumed they were expecting a massive lunch crowd and didn't want to have wasted seating.. I could deal with that.  Prices were in three tiers: 4.98, 5.98, and 6.98 for their lunch specials that included the entree, soup, and a mini tub of rice.  The distinction between Szechwan Garden and other places is that lunch comes out family style.  You have your own place, there are the entrees in the middle, and you pass around a tub of rice.  It allows sharing of others dishes which you usually wouldn't do.    I was really happy with this too.  I ordered the fillet in black bean sauce with tofu, and my friend ordered the orange chicken.  The orange chicken was tangy, crispy, and not overly deepfriend with a nice underlying orange taste from the zest.  The fillet was hot, tender, not dry, and hot (i know its sad when "hot" is a criteria).  My dish also had a nice spice to it from the black pepper, but it wasn't too bad that my friend couldn't eat it.  Service was fast.  Water was refilled often.  I liked this, but then I also thought it was too fast.  By the time our entree was on the table, she already laid the check next to my arm.  They kept repeatedly coming by asking if everything was okay and turning and leaving before I could really answer.  I felt like they wanted us to leave as quickly as possible so they could turn the table.  I don't get it, since there were still plenty of tables open.  Service aside, I would've given the place 5 stars, but the food is too good.  It's definitely my go to spot in Chandler for Chinese from now on.

Came here after I got my groupon with a friend for lunch.  I was pleasantly surprised the south east valley had a sushi place with such a trendy ambiance.  Prices may be a bit higher than other places, but you're paying for great ambiance and extremely fresh sushi.  I ordered nigiri and sashimi, so I can't comment on the rolls they make.  The salmon I had was buttery, and the tuna was fresh.  Service was fine for us at lunch, but I can see it would be slower at night being a new restaurant.  Our server Heather was friendly and outgoing and refilled our drinks in a timely manner.  I think given some time this place can work out the kinks.  It really depends on what you're looking for at dinner.  It's more upscale than Kona Grill yet still having a relaxed vibe.  I would consider the Sushi Room similar to a Stingray of the south east valley.  If I'm ever back in the area.. I'd definitely drop in for lunch again.

I've been to OHSO once with a friend and another time with a date.  I was excited to first go there due to their large arizona beer selection on tap.  Walking in, the place has a very industrial Arcadia look to it.  You could think of it as the Vig but with exposed cement board in the ceilings.    The crowd is a nice mix, but I never got passed the vibe.  It feels like a neighborhood bar where everyone knows each others name, but I don't know anyone.  There doesn't feel like there's any energy to the place.  Looking at the food menu, it's uninspired.  My friend ate lunch there and said it was nothing that great.    The thing I don't get is no happy hour.  Okay okay.. there's happy hour.. but it's until 5pm.  I don't work dental office hours and neither do most of my friends.  With so many other places offering a better vibe, food, and happy hour within a mile, I just don't think I'll be going back again.  I can sum up the whole experience to what happened on our way out.  OHSO is like the candy jar my date and I saw when we walked out.  She was excited to see it and grabbed one.  A few seconds later she made this sour face when she found out it was black licorice.

Gyros King is located in Chandler Fashion Mall in the food court.  It replaced what used to be Hot Dog on a Stick there.  Prices range around 6.95-9.95 for an entree.  The ambiance is the mall pretty much.  I went here for lunch with a few friends today.  Another friend of mine was raving about the hummus there.  I went with a standard Gyros Sandwich + Side Salad + Drink for 6.95.  It was a great price.  The salad was large with olives, peppers, feta, and beets.  The dressing was a balsamic.  Out of all the greek restaurants I've been to in Chandler, I was shocked to find this place had such a good salad.  The beets were an unexpected surprise, and the dressing was tangy.  The gyros had salad and tomatoes topped with gyros meat and tzatziki sauce.  The pita bread was warm and there was a lot of meat.  I think a few more sliced onions could've made it spectacular, but it was better than a lot of sandwiches I've had elsewhere.  It wasn't 5 stars because the gyros could've used just a little bit of onions and maybe something else, but it was fantastic nonetheless.  It's my favorite greek spot in Chandler now to go to.

Tried out the place today for lunch with a group of friends.  We have all been to star of india, pasands, copper kettle, kebab palace, etc etc.  From those places, I always liked Kebab Palace the most.  It's a little on the expensive side but clean and very flavorful.  India grill is in a great location on Kyrene and Elliot.  The space is very new and clean.  There are high ceilings and a lot of walking space between tables that lends to an open feel.  Service was impeccable.  They refilled our waters many times and asked if we wanted more naan.  They also to be genuinely attentive asking if we needed anything.  The price point was about $11 / person.  Kebab is around $13 and most other places are $9.  The variety was the same amount as Kebab Palace, but there were a few more dessert items.  I would say there are maybe 9 or 10 different lunch items to choose from split half between veggie and meat.  I took a taste of each of them, and the butter chicken was my favorite.  The lamb was a bit too gamey.  The tikka masala wasn't as good as other places either.  The veggies was nothing to write about.  My favorites was the garlic naan that comes with the meal, and the veggie pakoras which had an awesome seasoned filling that I have not seen at other places.  I wish the other items had the same seasoning level as the veggie pakoras.  It would have made this place better than kebab palace.  Overall, I loved a few items they served here.  I think they fell short on seasoning, but the service and space they have make up for it a little bit.  It'd be a toss up for me between this place and Kebab, but I think you can't go wrong with India Grill.

First thing people will probably want to know is how long the wait is.  At 11:30, the wait was about 15 minutes, and my gf was already in line at the doorjam of the entrance.  If you get there at 12:30 (when we left), I noticed the line was inside near the breakfast tacos area.    Next off, I don't have any nostalgia from eating at Rudy's from when I was young (I'm from Chicago).  I also recently ate at the Texas BBQ house up in Scottsdale which makes me feel like I'm a bit of a Texas BBQ expert.  Imagine if you watched a bunch of travel documentaries about London.  Two weeks later, you travel to London and get off the plane.  That's how I feel when I walked into Rudy's.  We ordered brisket (moist), turkey, cream of corn, and new potatoes.  The brisket was awesome.  Very moist compared to other BBQ I've had.    The turkey was also not dry at all, and it was well flavored.  Cream of corn was excellent and not too sweet.  The new potatoes were quartered boiled potatoes with butter drenched on them (yes delicious).  You get some bread with your meal and everything comes on wax paper which is supposed to be shiny side up.  I like their condiments area with the different peppers.  Their sweet tea was also great, and I especially liked how it wasn't as cloyingly sweet as I've had at other places.  The only downfall is that I wish their sauces tasted better.  They have their bbq and their sissy.  It's probably a personal preference, but I like a sauce with some major kick to it.  I mixed in the hot sauce into the Rudy's sauce which made it taste better.  I also think the brisket needed some sauce to it.  Even though it was moist, it lacked on salt.  Those reasons aside, I found the food to be the best Texas BBQ I've had.  Long lines may be there, but it moves pretty quickly and gives you time to figure out what you want.  I'll definitely be back here when I have another BBQ kick.

If you're looking for some Vietnamese cuisine near Chandler Blvd & Rural Rd, take your first immediately available u-turn and head to Pho Dalat.  My review is based on Sage being a restaurant  Sage had so much potential.  Its located near Cafe Krishna on the southeast corner of Rural and Chandler.  A perfect location to get the Intel crowd for lunch.  Sage is housed in what used to be a few failed bars, but it has been completely remodeled.  There are garage doors ala Postino style that open out to the front.  The patio has been expanded with more contemporary furniture, but my compliments stop there.  Walking in, there's a dart machine, golden tee, and jukebox to the right.  In the middle of the restaurant is a pool table.  There's large rectangular hightops and a few low tops.  A weird mix?  Wait until you look over and see a couch meant for a patio that is cream colored with brown stripes.  The large built in seating on the side is in red.  The floor is a dark exposed concrete.  The walls are this odd green/blue tinge that reminded me of avatar skin.  We also were listening to some country music, which turned to hip hop, which turned to some top 40.   To start off, we ordered tea.  Why is this important?  They ran out of tea.  We ordered the pork spring rolls.  They were nice size, but the peanut sauce came in a plastic cup.  The pork was super dry, and I had to lace a lot of sauce on it.  The spring rolls were lacking something crisp.  It could've used more mint.  We got the Sage House Special and Rare Steak Pho.  The broth was a murky brown that was too sweet with a very salty undertone.  I think the chef added too much salt so tried to balance with sugar.  Then added too much sugar and added more salt.  Rinse and repeat.  The meat was very well done and chewy.  The rice noodles were undercooked.   The worse part was after we were done.  I stared at the middle of the table, and I didn't say anything for a few minutes,  I was trying to decide if I had to throw up or not.  The only redeeming quality of the place was the staff.  They were attentive and friendly.   Sage has the location... and it might be a great bar ... but when it comes to food, I could put something better together with a package of instant pho and some beef.  Drop the Vietnamese Cuisine off the name and add on Asian Fusion, and we'll all forgive the food.

One month!  Why didn't I follow my one month rule?  I usually wait a month after a restaurant opens up before going there for dinner, but I haven't been to Binkley's or Cafe Bink before.  With all the great things I heard, I had to go to Bink's Midtown as soon as I could. I regretted it.  My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night and waited to talk to the hostess.  We waited a while, and I started to see what was happening up front.  The guy ahead of me said.. "hey, what's going on? do we have a table or should i wait outside.. what do you want me to do?" they finally told him his table was ready.    My turn came up and I sat there for 5 minutes watching them take one page after another and clip them together.  Why didn't they do this before hand? We were seated right next to the front door, but I would have rather been in the more inviting living room.  At least I wasn't seated outside where it was freezing.  Our water came out promptly, but we waited 10 minutes before the server came.  We ordered a carafe of wine and waited another 15 minutes before that came out.  Service aside, I was excited by the menu.  We ordered the beets, leeks, risotto, mussels, parsnip soup, sweetbreads, beignets, squash, and brussel sprouts.  The waiter's eyes went a little wide, and he grabbed the table next to us to make more room.  Five minutes later the hostess came by and asked if we were expecting more people and why we didn't tell them?  I felt offended that they thought I pulled over a table and didn't say anything to them.  I explained the situation, they paused, and he walked away.  20 minutes later. yes, 20 minutes later. our food finally arrived.  Of course, as they were putting the food on the table, they knocked over a glass of wine on to my girlfriend.  She somehow ninja'ed her way from getting anything spilled on her.  The worse of it all though, was she had to ask 2 different people to replace her glass of wine.  The food was some highs and lows.  The foei gras donuts and mussels were okay.  The leaks, beets, and risotto were great.  We especially loved the cheeks in the leaks.  Overall though, I just wasn't happy with the place.  The service was horrible, and the staff had no energy or personality.  With all the waits we endured, I just can't recommend this place to anyone at all.  What's worse is I give the valet my ticket and watch him almost stall out my car 3 or 4 times while trying to back up.  My two cents. Stay away for a few months.  Maybe then things will get better.
