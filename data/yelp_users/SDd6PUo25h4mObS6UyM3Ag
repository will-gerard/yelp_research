Professional, clean, trustworthy folks.  Love this place so much better than autozone down the road.  Always get my batteries done here.

My wife and I use to love this place but the past few times we have visited, it's definitely not what it use to be. The sounds didn't work on the tv at our booth.  We use to come in almost every Sunday to watch football but now they severely reduced their usual menu till 1 pm in Sunday since they share a kitchen with the place next door. There is usually open seating so it's nice not having to wait, but definitely not the same great experience we use to have.

Came here for a car wash and was pleasantly surprised at everything they have to offer inside.  When I first pulled up, the guy was polite and guided me through the process of selecting what j wanted to get.  It was his first day but he called over a guy to help answer a few questions, no biggie.  He was professional. I went inside the store front and got some bbq while I waited. The food was ok but was overpriced for what you got. There were a lot of cool nick knacks in the shop ranging from cards, to signs, to glassware, to books to clothing.  It seemed a little overwhelmed up front where the main cashier is also the one making the coffee drinks. The back seating area where I waited for my car was nice. I watched my car go through the tunnel on a video screen.  Overall, a cool vibe to the whole place.  Unlike any other car wash or gas station I've ever been to. I was also definitely pleased with the quality of the car wash I got.
