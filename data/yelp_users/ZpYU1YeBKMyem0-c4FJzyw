This place is awesome... it makes me forget that I'm in Phoenix sometimes.  While I can't review the whole menu, I know their yogurt, orange juice, and coffee is awesome!  Service is usually really good and friendly, and the fact that you see a lot of the same people there a lot means that they're probably keeping more than just me happy.  Check it out next time you're in the area... driving, cycling, or walking.

If you need anything powdercoated, this is the place to go.  Hugo and the guys that work there are professional and their work is right on.  I've had a couple of bicycle frames, and a set of wheels powdercoated and couldn't be any happier.  They look great and turn-around time was about a week.  Their color selection is very extensive as well... check'em out next time you need something done.

After two years of living less than 2 miles away from this place, I finally decided to stop in.  I'm glad I did... I love how low key it is, the selection of produce, the prices, and the older folks shopping are way more pleasant than those at that Fry's on Indian School and Miller (I don't go there unless I have to).  If you live close and you've never been, stop on by next time you need to go to the grocery store.  You'll probably like quite a bit over the Fry's, Safeway, and Bashas around the corner.

We've brought our dogs here the last few times and they've been excellent.  Unfortunately sometimes we have to leave our two little ones in the doggy hotel, but we know they're in good hands which makes it a lot less hard.  Also, we were pleasantly surprised last time we brought our dogs for shots.  One of them seemed to have had a reaction to the shot so they asked us to drop him off and they kept him for observation through the day to make sure everything was OK.    This is the Clinic by Einsteins on Scottsdale and Thomas, the one with the dog statues facing the street!

So this Starbucks gets 1 star for convenience (even though sometimes it's not).  Every time I drive-through, I'm reminded of that Monster.com commercial with the monkeys.  Monkeys could probably run this place better than the current crew.    Between messed up orders, over-filled coffee cups (didn't you read about that mcdonald's customer who sued for spilled coffee?), and slow service (a cup of coffee should be ready by the time I get to the window) my not-so-frequent-anymore trips to this starbucks are always an adventure.  I guess at least they keep me guessing... how will we mess up next time?

Except for the one lady "Ashley" (she's only messed up once), this place is a mess... I really need to stop going here instead of writing bad Yelp reviews.

I've gone to this place a couple of times over the last month or so, and unfortunately it wasn't as good of an experience as it should have been.  I really like the lady with the Italian accent, she's been great to deal with.  However, there's two other employees that weren't too eager to help and didn't seem to be so excited to be there.   I don't know anything about tailoring, altering, sewing, needles, etc. so that's why when I go there, I expect to talk to someone that does know, and when they're not very helpful, it makes me scratch my head and not want to come back.

This place is great... parking is so easy since the renovation and of course everything in the store is why I come.  Granted I don't live too far, so it's fairly convenient, but I look forward to as I tend to find something new and delicious every time.  The staff is also super friendly, and typically you'll find the same folks working (a huge plus).  If you haven't tried their Falafel and Tatziki sauce, it's a must for any vegetarian or someone looking for Arab food!

I've had a couple of bad experiences at this store over the last 6 months and will not be returning.  In particular, the last time I was there, I dropped off a battery to see if it could be re-charged.  It was late on a Saturday so they told me I'd have to leave it overnight and that they would call me the next day as it could take as long as a few hours.  After half of Sunday had gone by, I hadn't heard from them so I gave them a call... it turns out, nobody put the battery in the charger so they assured me in 2 hours I could come pick it up.    I didn't want to drive down tot he store unless the battery was done, so when I called, the very unfriendly person on the phone didn't know what the status was, and that they would call once they found out.  Another 2 hours went by and nothing... by this point, I was going to have to go on Monday to pick up my battery.  Anyway, when I finally was told the battery was done, it turned out the battery couldn't hold a charge anyway.  They were smart enough to not ask me if I wanted to buy a new one.

I was referred to this Discount Tire by the guys at LeSueur Car Company when I needed new tires.  Mitch was helpful over the phone answering questions, quoting me prices, and scheduling an appointment for the next day.    When I arrived the next day, I was not very happy that the tires they had told me were going to be in stock hadn't arrived yet from their warehouse.  Brian wanted to make sure I was satisfied so he made a couple of suggestions and we ended up picking a different set of tires.  The tires he suggested were a bit more, but he sold them at the same price for the inconvenience.  He even gave me a 30day return period if I'm not happy with the tires.  Overall, it would have been great for this trip to have gone 100% smoothly, but sh*t happens and at least they cared enough to want to make things right.  I'll keep coming back and I'll recommend others go there as well.

We had one car in mind from the beginning and went to check it out.  We're not huge fans of the "dealership experience", but it was actually pretty good at AT from the start.  The sales process wasn't awkward, they weren't pushy, and I would say their "one price/one person" policy is probably a good idea.  I don't know whether this is an AT policy or if it's Toyota across the board, regardless, I would encourage you to check out AT if it's got the car you're looking for.  They offered us a fair price for our trade, and made us not "hate" going to a big dealership.

Has most of what we need, however I'd rather go to the safeway up the street. The pizza at bashas is inexpensive and pretty decent, regular groceries and butchery stuff seams to be a bit more than the safeway but quality is always good.  Except for the one check-out lady who was grumpy once, this place hasn't disappointed me since.  Well they don't carry blue bunny ice cream sandwiches which is a shame.

Went in last week as a customer for the first time.  I've always known that when it comes to tennis, there's probably not many (if any) stores like this in the valley.  My first impression, as is probably everyone's, was how much of a selection they have.  Clothing and equipment wise, they have a lot of stuff in stock.   The store was busy, which is a good sign.  Though the staff seemed to be busy, we were asked if we needed help, and one of the people working even answered a few questions we had.  This person was helpful in helping me pick a good string to do my racket with.  My racket was strung while I waited, which was unexpected.  It took about 25 minutes, but it saved me a trip later on that week.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  I'll keep coming back for some of my needs as I get back into playing tennis.  It's got a good "local business" feel, and they seem to not take that lightly or for granted.

I know this could have all been avoided had I thought about "What if I get a flat?" before riding.  Anyway, I didn't think that and rode down to South Mountain anyway.  On the way back, I flatted and couldn't fix it.  I called a Taxi to drive me home... First strike was "where is Siesta and Central?"  Silly me for assuming that VIP Taxi might have Google or something along those lines where you can just type what I just said and it gives you an exact location.    Second strike: "we'll have a Taxi out to you shortly"... Ok, can you be a bit more specific? Shortly is relative.  Shortly can be 5 minutes or it can be 3 days depending on the context.  I'll never know as the cab didn't show up for 1:25 minutes.    Luckily someone else was able to pick me up.  I'll more than happy to spend the $40 I would have spend on the taxi on lunch as a "Thank You".

I need to write an update as I was very pleased with the way they handled a complaint.  This sure can't be the same VIP taxi I initially had a bad experience with.    Anyway, the story goes like this: I complaint on Yelp about a really bad experience, they apologized, sent a gift card, and said please give us another shot... so I did.    Friday night in Old Town Scottsdale after a few cocktails we decided to call it a night.  We called VIP, and within 15 minutes the taxi showed up.  Not only that, but while we were waiting, I received a text that my taxi was on the way (this never happened the first time around!).  The driver was very friendly, and actually used the meter (if you've ever been out in Old Town, you know cabbies never use it, and use it as a way to rip you off once the bars close). I apologized for the short trip, and he told us not to worry about it, "it's my job, and sometimes it's a short ride" he said.  Anyway, overall I was extremely pleased and I'm glad I gave them a second shot.  I will definitely call them first next time I need to get home via taxi.

I picked Miguel from Flores Air Conditioning solely on his feedback on Yelp and I'm glad I did.  He showed up when he said he would (I know, he's supposed to but not everyone does!), was very courteous and fixed what was a little issue without trying to sell me anything that I didn't need.  I highly recommend this company, from the service to the professional appearance, it was a great experience.  I will be doing all of my servicing with Mr. Flores from now on!

I didn't know you could even review a Post Office... but since you can, I figured I would.  Though I don't come here very often, it seems as if every time I have some sort of issue.  I do want to clarify that the times (only a couple) that I've gone to the customer counter, they've treated me well.  So about those issues... in the last 3 times I came after hours to use their automated machines, one time the machines were out of order, the second time they were out of all flat rate packaging, and the third, the drop box was jammed and therefore I couldn't drop off what I went to drop off... yeah very frustrating!!!

Probably the worst bagel I've ever eaten... granted, I should know better for ordering a bagel at an airport Starbucks, however I was starving, I was super late to my gate, and it was right in front of it.  I'll wait for peanuts next time.
