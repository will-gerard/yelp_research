I heard about this place for a moms distribution list I'm on.  Apparently, it's been there for a long time, and it now has new owners.  I took my daughter there today for a play date. It's essentially a mini town, with all the fixings.  There was a police/fire station, complete with items to try on and play dress up. There was a dress shop for girls, and it had lots of cute items too.  Dominoes Pizza (a kitchen), and there was even a mini road for the kids to drive the little push cars.  My daughter had  GREAT time, and burned off a lot of energy. They even had free WiFi.  =0  Of course, I found that I needed to watch my daughter to ensure that she was sharing, as some items were very popular.  I suspect that the 2-10 crowd will LOVE this place.  I will be back.

Decided to give them another try. Food was tasty as always. This time, the service was much improved. =) On this trip, the manager did come by and check on us.  I did want to add that I was in contact with the district manager after our last visit with horrible service. He thanked me for the feedback, and said he would send us out a discount. To date, no discount received.

I've been seeing Dr B for three years now for all of my animals (3 cats and a dog).  My dog is very scared at the vet, and Dr B handles her like a pro.  I've taken my family members there for basic check ups, testing, shots, and grooming.  The only thing that I've noticed is that there always seems to be new techs.  Several of the staff members have been there seemingly a long time.  In any case, I've been very happy with Dr B, and would recommend him to others.  As to the comments on his religion, I don't see how that matters.  It's a personal thing and he has done an excellent job with my fur-friends.

Lunch out today with a group of former coworkers, and we decided on Cyclo. Two of us had been before and loved it. Justina is always so funny and entertaining. Decor is modern. Today, I decided to try the lemongrass chicken, and was it ever good. =) I do wish that I had ordered a side of the green beans, as another table had them and they looked delish. We will certainly be back.   I also really loved the addition of fruit to the water. It made it taste fresh like the food.   Great job Justina! Keep it up.

It's been quite a while since I came to CPK. I came (somewhat) resistantly for dinner to meet friends. My last visit to this location provided medocure service (at best) and a gummy under cooked pizza and a somewhat wilted salad. I have to say that this trip that both the service and the food were markedly improved. Funny, but I went to a pizza place but strangly enough I typically don't seem to order pizza. I decided to try one of their new salads, the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken. I totally loved the combination of (roasted) butternut squash, dates, avocado, almonds, beets, egg and cranberries. It was such a wonderful blend of flavors. I think that I may have a favorite salad there now.

Have heard about this place for a very long time, and decided to give it a try. It certainly lives up to the hype I've heard.  I got the "Best Chicken Sandwich" and decided to upgrade from the chips. The sandwich was excellent, moist chicken breast, spicy avocado & chipolte vinaigrette providing amazing flavors! I asked for the much talked about roasted sweet potatoe salad, but had to exchange it. It had pecans in it, and I'm allergic. I switched and got the chilled caprese pasta salad. Was a good offering, but wish it had a bit more flavor kick.  I'd certainly recommemd checking them out!

We are big fans of this restaurant, although we usually go to the Mesa location. Since we were meeting friends from Gilbert for dinner, we decided to try out the Gilbert location.   We got there about 6pm on a Sunday night. They were busy, but did not look packed. Even with a party of 6, we were seated within 15 minutes. We had a friend waitress, and she quickly took or order and got drinks. My friend noticed that the menu called out draft, so he asked about beers on tap. We were told that only the Mesa has beer on tap. =( We decided to order a kids mac & cheese, two different pizza's, a burger, and a salad. We were told that the pizza's took about 25 minutes, and that was fine, since we had ordered a salad as an appetizer.   Now...the waiting began...about 30 minutes after we were there, the waitress came back to tell us that the kitchen was out of the hatch green chile that goes on their "The Match with Hatch" burger. My friend loves spicy food, so was disappointed on this and said to do jalapenos instead. We asked if the food was in process, and was told that it was and they would come back with an estimate. Around 45 minutes, the kids meal, salad, and burger showed up, followed very quickly by 1 of the 2 pizzas. The wagon wheel spinach salad was its typical tasty self. Typically my child LOVES the mac & cheese from here, and dives in. This time, it took a lot of encouragement to get her to eat it. It was a lot drier than usual and didn't seem to have the same cheesy flavor compared to what she usually has at the Mesa location. I typically love their pizza's; however, the Veg Out that we ordered was not up to the usual quality. My 1st slice was burned black on the bottom and tasted burned. At least only 1/2 of the pizza was burned. Our friends told us that their pizza wasn't like what they usually get back in Chicago, but described it as "edible" so I wasn't sure if that was their way of saying that they didn't like it?  The waitress did appologize for the slow service and issues. She did also give us a discount to make up for the long wait times. My impression was that something was off the night of the May 4th for dinner service. I wondered if they were short staffed? We've never had that slow of service at Flancer's or such unimpressive  food. I doubt that I will be able to talk my Chicago friends into giving them another try. =(  This being said, I really hope that this isn't typical for Gilbert location, and that we just caught them on a bad night. We've always loved the service and great food from Mesa.

In the past, I have always been a huge fan. My last dining experience left a lot to be desired. Since it was lunch, we decided to do the slices. We ordered a slice of pesto, slice of peperoni, slice of mushroom, and a slice of cheese. When the order was read back, I corrected the cashier, and thought she corrected. I will say that the eye roll when I said the order was incorrect was a bit much.  When the food came out, it was not corrected. My child will only eat cheese, so no cheese was an issue. The couter person did rush us a cheese slice for us, which was very much appreciated. I found the pesto to have a lot more oil/grease than usual. The peperoni was pretty much well done. Nothing tasted fresh...  The one redeaming item was that the antipasta salad was excellent. I have never had a bad salad from there.  I do love that they updated the dining room with more seating!

One of my girlfriends picked Kokopelli Winery in downtown Chandler for our monthy get together.  When I walked in on a Wednesday night, there was a very small crowd, so I was a little concerned.  I've always been told that the AZ wines are just ok, but I decided to give them a try.  Our waitress brought me a sample of their reserve Chianti.  I'm not usually a fan, but this one has a pretty smooth finish.    I was looking over the menu, and having a hard time deciding. A friend of mine had HIGHLY recommended the garlic chicken. When I saw the menu said 40 cloves of garlic, I has some serious 2nd thoughts.  I decided to give it a try.  WOOOO was it ever good.  The chicken was litterally fall off the bone and super juicy!  I finished things off with their EXCELLENT bread pudding.  Wow.  Was it ever good.  Their brandy sauce totally makes it.  I'd actually love to go back and have this again.

I recently have team members in town from out of state.  I used to eat here all the time, so suggested it for the team dinner location.  I used to make the drive from Chandler to have dinner here, and was always impressed with the food.  The chicken or beef koobideh is always a favorite of mine, and another is Ghormeh sabzy but I always ask for it to be served with crispy rice.  Yum.  I honestly think that you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!

This is the only work of his that I have seen in person. After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting. The house was amazing and beautiful. I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty.

I've always loved spinach on my pizza, but my typical complaint at other places was the tiny amount that was used.  NOT SO AT SPINATO'S.  This spinach loving pizza fan was in HEAVEN!    This was honestly the best pizza that I've had in a while...thin light crust, tasty tomato sauce, cooked to perfection.  We also got the anti-pasta salad, and their house Italian dressing was awesome.    My only complaint was the lack of alcohol.  Would have loved a nice glass of wine to go with the supper yummy pizza.

We used to be big fans of AHR, but our recent experience with them says that something changed. We were helping out a family member and arranged to get their A/C unit looked at, as it had been cooling inconsistently since she moved into her new place. We called, and got the appointment pretty easily. The tech was on-time. They came out, we paid the service fee. I was there for a while with the tech while they tried to trouble shoot. After several phone calls to someone else (?), we were presented with what they thought the issue was and a quote for the repair.   Moving on to the repair: The tech trouble shooting and running up a 700 bill, we were then told that the unit needed to be replaced. We were given a hand written quote for two units. There was no statement of work (IE what that price included), just simply a unit and a price. We were told that they had a special financing deal, but that we had to decide quickly. With a 10K quote, we wanted to compare. The next three companies that came in where all significantly UNDER their quote. Our lowest quote was 4K UNDER their quote (same mft, same size). The tech told us that IF we did the replacement unit with them, that the cost of the repair would go toward the new unit. The numbers just did not match up for us, so we went with another contractor. What I find funny about all of this is that we NEVER heard from AHR. Nothing. No inquiry. No any questions. No nothing. The higher cost and the no interest on their side apparently on winning the business basically lost us as customers.

I love to come in and get my fix for some yummy Thai food.  One of my favorite dishes to get here is the Drunken Noodles, and it has to be one of the more spicy dishes on the menu.  I also really like the red curry dishes.  I've tried so many things on the menu, and have liked everything.

I have seen this place several times when we were out in the area, but we never seemed to be out there during open hours. We FINALLY made it out there during serving hours, and we were NOT disappointed. I love to try spinach omelet, and this one was so flavorful and tasty. Even my husband commented on how good it was. He went with the blueberry pancakes, and said that they were very good. Even with his full stack, he commented that he didn't feel like a carb overload. Our mom got the corned beef hash, and she said that it was really good. We all agreed that this was a breakfast/lunch place to keep on our top tier list.

We've take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.  I've seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.  Our daughter loves the themed rooms.  With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.  My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.  Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!

I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.

I was so excited to be in the neighborhood and drop in here. It's been a while since we've been there, but always loved it. Tonight, I walked in and caught the end of happy hour. Decided to order a glass of wine (excellent) and the garlic bread, since I thought my daughter would like it. The drinks came out quick...then...the "rush" hit, and .the wait game begin. After seemingly like forever, our appetizer came out, but only not the garlic bread but the warm brie. I should have taken that as providence and kept it...but...didn't. Much later, the garlic bread came out. Honestly, it was so not worth the wait. it was for the most part totally unmemorable. It needed more garlic or some flavor. Waited. Waited. Waited. Finally our dinner came out. My pizza was just short of cold, on the luke warm side, so i'm guessing that it had been in the window for a while. My daughter's pizza was super steaming hot. She did the kids Hawaiian, and that was pretty tasty. Mine had a good taste, but cold pizza just wasn't overly appealing. Saw our waiter several times, but never seemed to be able to get his attention, so the wait game begin. I finally asked on of the other servers if i could get our bill. I'm really hoping that I caught them on an off-night. I love having something organic and gluten free, and I'm even willing to pay more for it. i just wish that the taste and service were like they were the last time I was there (believe was Buon Gusto then).

Quaint small place to grad a drink and a bite to eat. We've eaten there a couple of times, and never been disappointed. Last night, we decided to try the chicken pesto pizza. YUM! Super tasty pesto without being oily (ie greasy pizza), mixed with the sun dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, and chicken was so tasty! In fact, the leftovers will be dinner tonight. =) Generous pours on the wine are nice too. My friend got the portobello mushroom sandwich, and it also looked super tasty. My daughter enjoyed her hot dog and ate the whole thing. She then played 20 questions with our waiters, who graciously played along. We'll certainly be back. Did see that they do live music too!

Having lunch with a girlfriend, and came to the another place to eat in the same area  that had closed.  We decided to walk down and check out Firehouse subs.  We walked into the place, and the very 1st thing I noticed was the YUMMY smell.  The staff was very friendly, and happy to suggest their favorites.  I decided to give the turkey sandwich a try.  I have to say that it's the first time in a while that I had turkey on a sandwich that actually tasted like turkey.  Most places it has a generic vague flavor and all the meats basically taste alike.  NOT HERE.  Both of us throughly loved our sandwiches.  I also checked out the super cool soda machine.  Couldn't believe all the options.  Plan on eating here again!

I'm a fan of this small family place. My husband and I love to go here and have dinner. Their special hummus is always impressive.  My husband tells me that their lamb cannot be beat. I've had a bite of his, and always found it to be very tasty.  I've tried so many things on the menu, and have never had something that I didn't enjoy.  They offer a wonderful happy hour, and one weekend a month they have a belly dancer in.

Was so sad we we moved father away from this little gem. We always try to have lunch or dinner here when we are back in the area. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Tuesday night gyro special is awesome, of course I add in a Greek salad for myself. The shrimp appetizer is always great, and I believe that it's on the happy hour menu too. My favorite, is the Greek Chef salad. For some reason, I always seem to come back to it. My husband loves the lamb and typically gets a lamb dish. I can't think of a single thing that we've ordered that we didn't like.

If you are looking for a fine or finer dining experience, then move along. This place keeps me coming back by being inexpensive, tasty, and FAST! I love that I can sit down, and start getting myself tasty items off the line. Plates are $1 to $3 each, so you can afford to get a lot of variety. Plates are typically 2 or 4 pieces. They are also more than happy to make something for you if nothing on the belt tempts your fancy. WARNING: The longer you sit there the more inclined you might be to add another plate.

All I can say is YUM!  Nothing starts my day like a cup of nectar-of-the-gods from Dutch.  It's got a great taste without the burned taste of Starbucks.  The carmelizer is probably my favorite, but the black & white mocha is a close second.  Be sure to sign up for the text club, as they email out deals every week.  Tuesday is also double stamp day.  =)

Daughter is out busy today, so we decided to get sushi for lunch. Started looking for good recommended family places (ie not chains) to try out. Happened upon this little gem, and just so happens to be really close by (bonus).  Husband ordered the special (CA roll, goya, & miso soup), and then we decided to split Alaska Roll, Rainbow Roll, & Spicy Salmon. Everything tasted fresh and very tasty! Snuck a taste of the miso soup, and it was very nice.  We both liked the that it was a great, small neighborhood sushi restaurant. Nice background music, and the owner was behind the sushi bar making the roles. He was very accommodating on my "no mayo" request. =)   The one thing that I will note is that the hours showing on here are incorrect. Yelp says 12, but the door says 11:30. Also, this place is CLOSED on Sunday

Love to check out the local owned/opperated places.  We had heard wonderful things about the Gilbert location, and decided to try the one in Mesa.  We ordered food for my daughter basically right when we sat down, so that she would be eatting fast.  Was shocked at how fast her food came out.  Our food took a bit longer, as they were rather busy.  For the most part, everyone liked their selections.  My only comment is to be sure and read the beans that come with dinner.  I'm not a fan or refriend, and when I realized that...requested to change them.  Before they could switch, the food runner brought out our food.

The night started off with so much promise.  Trying a new place that is hosting a Jazz Jam.  The drinks arrived and were very good.  Next up were the apptizers, which were on happy hour for 1/2 price.  =)  We started with sliders and a cheese plate.  The sliders were ok.  Nothing really stood out about them.  I thought that the cheese plate was excellent; however, it wasn't something that my husband likes (he wants "real" food as he says).  For dinner, we ordered the baked rotol and a side salad.  WOW.  The portion size was huge, and this was by far the best dinner on the table.  Our two friends ordered an ahi tuna salad and a salmon pasta dish.  The Ahi was huge chunks, and was basically flavorless.  The salmon pasta tasted like the salmon was a bit old, and the pasta was over salted.  I'd certainly recommend the baked rotol.  We also got a baked cookie / ice cream desert that was really tasty.  The atmosphere was really nice, and the live music was awesome.  I'll be back probably for drinks.

What can I say, but I have a "Dutch" problem.  It's so nice to have good coffee without the over-roasted bitter taste of a well known competitor (yuckbucks).  Go for the Dutch Brothers awesomness.  The employees are always very friendly.  The lady that does the early morning shift knows my drink and it is always consistently great.  =)  My one complaint, and this is a yelp one...is that for some reason this location always comes up several screens down even with me sitting in front of them.  Why do locations farther away come up 1st?

My husband and I had tried doing a studio shoot for our family, and our dramatic young child had other ideas.  I decided that maybe a location shoot would work better.    I contacted Eric to negotiate arrangements. Between my husbands work schedule and mine, we were somewhat limited in what we could do, and we were hoping to get the pictures done in time for the holidays (December 2011).  Eric worked with us to come up with a date/time that worked.  We decided to meet at the Tempe Center for the Arts.    I had given Eric a quick idea on what we wanted (ie family group picture in a natural environment).  When we met, our two year old wanted nothing doing with "posed" images.  Eric was very flexible, and we started doing active shots.  As an additional surprise, we also brought along our dog, and he was able to incorporate her into some of the shots.    He was great to work with, and we ended up spending over an hour taking many different photos.  We had a lot great photos to choose from, and it took us a while to narrow it down to favorites.  We also got them in time to do a holiday newsletter and include pictures.  Thanks again!

Local place that we finally got over to try. We liked all of the flavors that we tried, but I especially LOVED that they have TWO non-dairy flavors that they offer every day!  =)  It's a great neighborhood spot. Loved that the owner was so nice and friendly, and that he brought his dog with him (outside on the patio with a big water). I love to support local businesses.

I've seen both Dr Glenn and Dr Schmidt, and think that they both provided excellent service. It was obvious to me that they both care for animals. I 1st met them when my senior dog had (basically) been misdiagnosed at another vet. I took her somewhere else for a 2nd opinion, and did a lot of asking for recommendations. This was the only vet clinic that I had several friends recommend. We live in Tempe, but still did the drive to their office. They have impressed me with the level of service and committment to my furry-family on every visit. I would highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a doctor for their 4-legged family members.  With four senior pets, they have worked us in with short notice.

Office staff can make or break your practice. I found this office through my benefits (ie doctors in an area). I called and make the appointment, expressed at that point that I was looking for BOTH medical and vision, and that there were a provider (in-network) for both. Got a call back later asking for my benefits. I provided both, and was then told that I would need seperate appointments. I said that was fine, and asked for two back-to-back appointments. Apparently, that is a cardinal sin and I was told not possible. Needless to say, I canceled the appointment and will be finding another doctor to try out. I don't see the issue with back-to-back appointments. Anyone else see why this should have been an issue?

We were over in this area visiting family, and decided to order take out so that we could watch the game. I always like to try pesto pizza from different places. The pizza was good, but a lot more oily than I like. The salad and the boneless wings were very good. I still really like their pizza, but probably won't get the pesto one again.  Love their thin crust.

It's been a while since we got to do a kid free date night, so we decided to try DC Steakhouse. I had heard some nice feedback from friends on them. We decided to go on a Sunday night thinking that it would be slower (and easier to find a baby sitter), and made a reservation for 5 pm. When we arrived, we were shocked at the full house. Yeah, that means that they must be good, right?  They had one table left, basically right in front of the door, and we were fine taking it.   We had originally planned to get an appetizer to split; however, nothing offered really appealed to either of us. We decided to get a beer (no draft) and a glass of wine. I almost always get a filet at a steak place, so I went with the medium size one so my husband could get a chunk of it too. He was so thrilled to see lamb chops on the menu, and quickly decided up it.  About the time our salads arrived, our waiter came back to tell us that they were out of lamb.  =/ Hubby was very disappointed, and changed his order to the smaller NY Strip. The salad were average...standard iceberg type mix with romaine. When our meal arrived, I was a bit surprised to see the potatoes wrapped in foil, but just quickly peeled it off. My filet was AMAZINGLY fantastic...perfect medium rare and so tender it was like butter! An item worth returning for without a doubt!  My husband's Ny was ok. He ordered his medium, so it had a heavier char taste (smoky) and was no where near as tender. He happily scarfed my exterior pieces that were more done, and we brought about 1/2 of his home. We decided to try one of the desserts, and when with the key lime pie. I was a bit surprised with the first bite to taste coconut.  Overall, I'd rate the desert simply ok. We'll certainly be back, but neither the NY or the key lime pie will make the menu. Again, the filet was amazing and totally worth a return trip.

We had heard about this place from a coworker. Since we were in the area, I decided to pick up treats for later. The staff was very helpful, and even looked up the recipe for the two that we wanted (Black Raspberry & Moose Tracks). My daughter insisted on eating some of hers right there on the spot. While I really liked the ice cream; the eating area not so much. Most of the tables were dirty, and several of them appeared to have been that way for a while. We sat at the cleanest of the available dirty tables. My original thought was a 3* rating; however, after my husband ate his ice cream I bumped it up a star. He said that it was the best he has had outside of New England.

What a shocking surprise to find meeting space hidden behind a gas station. I've driven by here so many times, and wondered what it was. We were just invited to an event here, so I got to see the inside. The facilities seemed to be really nice, but as I walked to the bathroom, I remember thinking that the walls must not have a lot of insulation, as you could hear activity in the rooms. The rooms seem to be fairly plain, and can be dressed up or down based up on the decor. Certainly a nice space for an event or dinner where you need more space.

Working makes it hard sometimes to get into the doctor when you are sick. After decided that it was past the time to go, I did a quick search to find someplace nearby that was open. I've seen this one while in the grocery store, but never seemed to be there when they were open.I came in, did the sign in. I was happy to hear that it should be only 30 minutes. Lucky for me, hubby got off work and was able to swing in and pick up our daughter. Needless to say, I was impressed by the two ladies working that night.

Had lunch here with a friend on what I think was maybe their second day open. We knew they were open, as my friend had called; however, there wasn't any signage to indicate name, that they were open, etc.  I ordered the turkey/brie sandwich with sweet potato fries along with a fresh squeezed lemon-aid. I wasn't able to eat the bread that the menu indicated that the sandwich came with; however, they were out of it.  Seemed strange to be out of something on the 2nd day, but the sourdough was ok. Next time I know to specifically ask for wheat.  One note, I had assumed that the turkey would be white meat; however, it was mixed.  Not a huge issue, but it was something that I would have liked to know as I'm not really a huge fan of dark meat.   My friend ordered the iced green tea and the grilled portabella salad.  She seemed to really enjoy it, so I think I'll have to try it next time.  We went during lunch, but we were also given the breakfast menu.  I will certainly have to go back to try their breakfast items.  It looked YUMMY.

Remembered that the have a drive thru window, so decided to swing by & see if they had good stuff. I got the nonfat white mocha, & it is nice w/out the bitter over roasted coffee. Hubby got the nonfat mocha. Friend tried their irish nut, basically hazlenut with irish cream.They both said the were good, but the irish one disappeared quickly!  Nice to get a great cup of fluffy coffee that did not have a burned over-roasted coffee taste.

Love visiting and supporting a local family owned restaurant. =) The staff is always very welcoming and friendly. =) My daughter LOVES their fruit cup, and it is so much better than the typical fruit cup.  Their eggs Benedict have to be my favorite, with the CA Benedict probably my most favorite. Yum!

I went into Coach and Willies with very low expectations of it basically being typical bad (greasy) bar food.  Wow, was I ever shocked and surprised.  We started with the Italian Nachos, and they were super tasty.  Even my two year old daughter got in on the fun.  Lots of yummy mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce.  My main course was the full size Sherry's Spinach & Chicken Salad.  My first thought when they brought it out was that it was the 1/2 size portion, but when I checked it was the full size.  The salad was excellent, but the portion size seemed smaller than other restaurants especially for the $11 price.  My girlfriend got the lobster bisque, and wow was that ever amazingly tasty.  We had decided to share so that we could get both.  While this was incredibly tasty, the full bowl was a very rich and large serving so in the future think a cup would do.  The other thing we tried were their sliders.  Tuesday nights they have a $2 slider special.  WOW.  Were those things every amazingly tasty.  We ordered two of each of the meat/cheese and jalapeno ones.  We ended up with the pizza and jalapeno ones, but wow they were both amazingly tasty and not greasy.  If you are looking for great food with a slightly higher price where you can watch sports, this is certainly the place.  I do suspect when there are things going on downtown Chandler, that parking will be an issue.  I only had two complaints.  1.  Most of the tables they had were the tall bar tables.  If you have smaller kids, this translates into longer wait times.  Even thought they had tables open, we had to wait for a short table.  A fidgety two year old has no business in a boaster seat in a high bar chair with hard tile under it.  2.  While the food was exceptional, they didn't seem to be staffed for the amount of crowd that they had.  Our server mentioned that they had to call in extra people to handle the rush.  I always remember the week of a holiday being busy...

Carmelizer or Black/white mocha are favorites.Dutch Brothers has to be one of my favorite places for pickup coffee in the valley. I'm SO happy to see additional locations opening!  They have a great dark roast coffee, but unlike a well known competitor theirs doesn't taste bitter and burned. =)  I seem to order the skinny Carmelizer or the skinny Black/White. My daughter recognizes the locations, and asks for one of their tasty smoothies. We seriously cannot drive by one without her asking.

We decided to give this place a try.  When the people coordinating the line found out I had never been there before, they gave me the intro. Sounds like a meat out.  They had lots of choices for meats all smoked.  We got there about noon, and it had a line to the front door.  Interestingly enough, the line did seem to move pretty. At the register, they asked me if I wanted to sample anything (since I hadn't been before).  I went with the smoked turkey.  Wow.  I have to say that this is the 1st time that I've gotten turkey that was not bone dry. The turkey was charred on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Color me happily surprised.  =)  After reading the reviews on here, I decided to skip all the sides, but did get a sample of the green chili soup.  I think that would be a winner. That taste was most excellent, and it had veggies.  Most of the sides seemed to be a mayo fest, so it was a good call on the skip.  My co-worker, got the prime rib - apparently they offer it on the weekend.  I was less impressed with his prime rib.  My key takeaway from this visit was to go with someone and share. I found 1/2 pound of turkey just WAY too much.  My co-worker was happy to finish it off for me.  My one only slight complaint is that this is must more of a family ho-down type place than a nice dinner out.  I'd suggest getting it to go and doing your own sides at home to go with the excellent smoked turkey.  =)

I had my 1st La Fonda experience with the daughter's location that opened down in Chandler. LOVED their salsa and the fajitas. Yum! We used to eat there a couple of times a month. When I moved to Tempe, I remembered that the original location was somewhere nearby...then...I saw the coming soon sign go up. I hate to admit it, but I would drive by and look for sign updates.  I was so happy to see it finally open. We stopped by around a 5:30 on a Friday night, but ended up leaving. The wait was approaching an hour and a 2 year old will NOT wait an hour for dinner. We came back a week or so later for lunch. The chicken fajitas were just as yummy as I remembered them. I got the cheese crisp and beans for my daughter; however, she was less than eager for either. I was less than eager to see the bowl of beans on top of her cheese crisp?  Would have rather had it served off to the side rather than the bowl on top of the cheese.  Quite a bit of the cheese stuck to the bottom of the bowl when I removed it.  =/  .

Since I moved to Phoenix, I've found that I tend to avoid the whole Scottsdale "salon" experience, as I prefer my "do" without the "tude." After doing research and checking out Rodney's experience, I decided to give him a try, and scheduled a Brazilian Blow out.  I was very pleasantly surprised with my visit with Rodney in the Jo Paris Salon. When I scheduled my appointment, he was specific and told me that HE ran on time so for me to please run on time. I heard this, and thought...Yeah - right.  In my entire life, I don't think I've had a single hair appointment that started and ended as scheduled.  My appointment was for 3:30, and Rodney took me back AT 3:30.  Color me surprised.  =)  From there, Rodney impressed me with his professionalism and service.  As promised, my Brazilion Blow out took 1.5 hours! I left with beautiful, straight hair!  Wow. I scheduled an appointment to come back for a hair cut.   Rodney's great service is a motivator for me to come to Scottsdale to get my hair done.  I'd highly recommend that if you are looking for someone for your hair, I'd look no farther!

My girlfriend has been telling me about Rita's for years it seems. She told me a while ago that they were coming here. I swear that she was doing the happy dance. I've been driving by this location for a while...waiting for them to open. The other day I happened to notice the umbrella out in front, and pulled in. They are OPEN, and the grand opening is still a couple of weeks out.  I LOVE coffee ice cream and feel compelled to try it whenever I see it.  Rita's coffee frozen custard did NOT disappoint. It was SO rich and creamy. I got a cup and brought it home, as I know it is one flavor that my husband will not sneak and eat up on me. I also picked up a Mango with vanilla custard (was told that it is one of the big favorites).  The three of us shared the large, with my two year old constantly clamoring for her bite. Needless to say, Rita's will be our local desert place.  They offered milk shakes, frozen custard, and lots of variety.

My favorite item on the menu so far has been Brussel sprouts. Seriously YUM! I love that everything is fresh made, locally sourced, etc. Love to go here with the girls. =)

This is probably one of our favorite of the fast food places. It is just about the only chain place that I will order chicken nuggets from, as are chunks of chicken instead of pressed/molded. Each location has a kids night, and my daughter regularly asks to go to these.  I went on line to view their menu, and found out all the offerings they do to help you ordering. Needless to say, now that I know protein-style is an option, it's the way that I order their grilled chicken sandwiches. =)

My mother had a ladies lunch here, and recommended it. We decided to give it a try for dinner. We started with the Eggplant Rollatini, and even my 5 year old child tried it. It was super good, and tells me that next trip I'll be trying an eggplant dinner. I tried the Alfredo pasta, with the special Gorgonzola Alfredo sauce. My daughter loved the kids spaghetti. =) The best recommendation was the Lemonchello cake - had a real lemon taste. Yum.

I did a lot of research and visited a lot of schools checking out places to send my daughter for preschool. Inspire was one of a very few schools to impress us.   I waited to do my review until I had adequate experience to comment upon, and she has attended there for a complete school year. I am amazed at the development and progress that she has made in the one year. She loves her teachers, and every day when we pick her up, she is so excited to tell us about what she learned. Most days, I feel (almost) like I have to drag her out since she wants to stay.  Their new campus provides a really nice outdoor space, and outdoor space is a key part of montessori. I was glad to see the kids starting seedlings. My friends are all impressed with the development that this program has provided my daughter. This location allows them to also include toddler students (starting at 14 months). This will be great for us if our family grows.  I find Ms Diana to be a professional that is very much interested in the growth and development of my daughter, and she has told me multiple times that her door is always open for me. Any issues or concerns that I have, had been quickly addressed to my satisfaction. All of the teachers seem to have the same philosophy, and have been happy to talk to me about anything. My daughter loves her teacher, Ms Ashley, and looks forward to coming and being in her class.  I know that we made the right decision. Our daughter has grown and developed at this school. All of our family and friends agree that she has grown and developed. If anyone has questions, I'm happy to chat with them on my experiences with Inspire Kids. I truly believe that this is an excellent school, and highly recommend them.

I am still very happy with our choice on IKM for a school for our daughter. We have been with IKM since 2011, and we have been so very happy with how she has grown and developed. I love that Ms Diana knows all the kids names, and that so many of the kids hug her. It tells me that she loves the kids and that they love her too.  Routinely when we go to leave, I have to wait for my daughter to give all her teachers hugs. My friends routinely tell us that she is doing work above her age.

LOVE this place. The family that runs the place is super friendly and nice. They have a chair for your little princess to get her pedicure too. That allows me to get a nice one too. Always have a great mani/pedi experience here!

Took my vehicle in today for a full detail - interior, exterior, & engine. I decided to drop off rather than wait, since I expected a time quote of 4 hours. They surprised me with a 2 hour quote. Showed up at quoted time, but car wasn't ready. Since I was dropped off, I had to wait. I waited, & decided to try the free popcorn. I have to say, that when my 8 year old car came out it was worth the wait. They did an excellent job! It looked almost brand new. It was the 1st detail EVER where they cleaned the glove box, the between seat storage, & removed the car seat. After 3 years installed, a bit afraid of the evil under it! It was nice to also have the manager say they were sorry for the wait. :-) I will be back for our other car!

A friend introduced me to this quaint family restaurant a year or so ago. It's a bit off the beaten path. We've been stopping in to eat when we are out in this area. It's also good enough to make a special drive out there.  We've tried the lamb, chicken, and most recently the sirloin. Wow. All of the meat kabbob's were tender and delicious. I ALWAYS get the spinach rice, as it is beyond amazing. Of course, I do love spinach too. My daughter has gotten several different items off the kiddo menu. Honestly, typically these offerings I find a bit gross, but I've tried everything she has gotten and it is far above and beyond most. =)   On our last trip, they has Pistachio ice cream...oh...wow...was that ever good. Hubby and daughter polished it off before I could get more than 2-3 small bites.   We will certainly be back. =)

We tried for dinner, & enjoyed. Even our picky eater LOVED the chicken souvlaki. Today, we tried breakfast. Very tasty strawberry smoothie, based on how fast my child sacked it down. :-P I did manage to get a taste, & it was nice & refreshing. I tried the bacon paninni w/ bacon, egg, spinach, sun-dried Tomatoes. YUM!   I noticed one review commented on tea setup. That is now fixed & available for self serve.

We decided to try this place last weekend. The reviews were really good. My husband decided to try the burger, and chose his specifically because of bacon on it. When the food arrived, after a couple of bites he asked the waitress about the bacon. Come to find out, the kitchen was out of bacon. He would have ordered something different knowing that. The "bacon" topic has come up ever time this place has come up. That being said, the waitress did her best to make up for it, after he told her about it.  We ordered the chicken tender basket for our daughter. SO nice to get freshly breaded and made chicken. More amazing, is that my child ate it all. My cobb salad was really tasty, but I think I want to come back on Sunday for the fried chicken. =) The only downside was that service was a bit slow, and it took forever to get the check, pay, and leave.

We recently discovered this little gem. I love how fresh everything is. Order a slice special, and it is made for you (not re-heated). The food has been outstanding. Service has been a bit hit or miss, but I suspect it depends on the time you get there. That being said, we have enjoyed everything we have tried there and will be back!
