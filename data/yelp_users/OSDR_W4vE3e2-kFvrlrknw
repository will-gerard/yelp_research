I love this place. I do all my postal needs at the UPS store. The employees are so friendly and helpful. If you go in enough they will start to know you by name. They are also pretty quick - I rarely ever have to wait in line.   Fun things you can do here: ship packages, buy stamps, copy paper, buy cards, get things notarized, they have PO Boxes, fax stuff and the list goes on and on....

This Flowershop is amazing & dangerous at the same time. Watch out because once you step in this place you will want to go back every week. I love the variety of succulents and pots. It's the perfect place to go when looking for gifts! They have an awesome section for cards as well. Stop by - you won't be disappointed!

I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!

Your mother always taught you 'never judge a book by it's cover!' San Antigua looks are deceiving! Looks nice on the outside but once you open it up and look inside....  First time moving to Scottsdale and I wanted to find a sweet place to live... I drove up to San Antigua and it looked amazing! I decided to look no further... This was the place for me!   I moved in! I loved it for a while.... Until a loud motorcycle owner lived below me... He would crank his engine every morning at 5:45! Annoying.... Lived on a corner spot & cars would race around the corner and if I had my windows open my place would be covered in dust! I hate that theirs carpet especially with all the dust - it's white and never look clean!   Also, the installation was horrible! I swear a was paying for the APS bill for the unit below me because when it was empty my APS bill would be reasonable BUT when it was occupied it was RIDICULOUS!   They pride theirselves with their two pools! However, for the longest time the back pool was closed! And they decided to fix it right when summer started! And during the hottest months they decided to close the front pool to fix that one! It seems like one of the pools is always closed - so annoying... And the pool furniture needs to be up graded - it's so old and worn...   SA needs to do a makeover! They need to remodel and get rid off all the rats they have running around. It needs a deep clean and a major renovation!

This place is great! I found this place because of YELP... I set up an appointment and got my car in right away...   Now I was a little worried about getting my oil changed because its never cheap.. they usually tell me I need to get my filters changed, things flushed, new breaks, new rotarydirters, etc! It alwasy cost be at least $700+! And it had been a while since I had my oil changed maybe about 5,000+ miles -- I've been slacking....   So I am waiting in the little waiting room and I see the mechanic come in and ask for me... All I am thinking is "Oh Shit!" this can't be good... The mechanic is going to sit me down and tell me everything that needs to be done... This is just terrible.... And it turned out to be the complete opposite! The mechanic was so nice! He said my car looked fine and that in the future I should look into getting things flushed but it wasn't necassary right now. GREAT NEWS! I loved that he was honest! My oil changed cost me about $37! Amazing! I will never go anywhere else for as long as I live in Scottsdale! Whitey's Auto Repair is the place for my little honda!

So I recently moved to Scottsdale, AZ from Saginaw, MI. Before I moved here I had never gotten a pedicure or a manicure! And man was I missing out for 24 years! I recently received my first manicure and pedicure and it was AMAZING! Not only did my toes and nails look amazing - the environment was outstanding.   Michelle is not only the best nail tech - but she is hilarious! I don't think I laughed so hard in a long time. Her and Rhonda - another amazing nail tech - are so friendly and have such a great following. I couldn't believe how busy the salon was! People coming in and out of there every second!   I now get my nails done weekly! I get so many compliments on them and I feel great! I will always be a Michigander at heart but now with great nails! :) thanks to Tangles!!!

All I gotta say is it's a love hate relationship... more love than hate! I can honestly say I'm obsessed! I completely fell in love! It was like an abusive relationship - I go in get beat up but still in LOVE and keep going back for more!  I enjoy working out but I am picky about my workouts. I don't mind paying the money if it is worth it... I do Pure Barre 7 days a week and when my BFF told me about this boxing gym that she found I was a little skeptical. She thought it would be the perfect combo with our current schedule.. PB 7 days and Boxing 3 days a week! I told her I would give it a shot!   HOLY COW! On my first day as I was driving in... I got a little nervous.. Wasn't sure if I was going to last... I was a little intimidated by the whole atmosphere... you know boxing gloves, a boxing ring, punching bags, dumb bells, medicine balls, men with muscles (real muscles) etc. I didn't know what the heck I have gotten myself into. I thought okay just one session and then I can say I tried it... After my first session I was on the floor dying! My lungs hurt, my muscles were cramping, my abs were on fire... I didn't know what hit me! I completely fell in love! It was like that abusive relationship - I go in get beat up but still in LOVE! I signed up for a month right away!   My BFF and I go 3 days a week! It's totally worth every single penny! 3 days a week for 1 month doing a semi-private for 30 minute sessions for $150 each. Honestly, Brendan kicks our ass in those 30 minute sessions that I don't think I could or would want it to be any longer! After each session I feel like I am getting stronger, my punches are getting better and my confidence is raising. I'm not intimidated by walking in there anymore... Everyone is pretty friendly and no one really cares if your punches look pathletic and your ladder climbs looks completely ridiculous... There just there to get their workouts in.   I recommend it to anyone who likes an intense, hardcore workout, where your lungs will be burning, your muscles will be fatigued and the coach will not let you stop. Ask for Brendan.. he's a no nonsense kind of guy!   I found myself driving in now excited... repeating 1 2 1 2! POW!

I enjoy a soy misto.... but I feel like it how much I enjoy it depends on who is making it.... This Starbucks is pretty hit & miss with their baristas! Not everyone can be a barista... There's a guy that works at this location & he should be making the drinks every time because they always turnout out "PERFECT".... I know by who's making the drink if it is going to be good or not... At at $4+ a drink it sucks if its not good..... Come on Starbucks... figure.... it..... out!

A little place I would like to call Heaven!   Daily Dose is amazing. Daily Dose makes me want to be a better person... The consistency of being wonderful every time I go is what brings me back! I have never once had a bad experience there. Friendly, warm, inviting atmosphere & amazing food. I could eat breakfast, lunch & dinner there every day.....   Let's talk about what makes them so great... I know - you want details....  Well to start homemade warm giant pretzels is a go-to every time. Especially during happy hour.   Chicken nachos...... no brainer.... $5 during happy hour and know what's even better DD is extending their happy hour for the summer 4p - till CLOSE!   My go-to is Cobb Salad with a veggie patty on top - dressing on the side please.... The salad is huge! Filled with fresh lettuce, tomato, crispy bacon, egg, etc.. The veggie patty homemade - warm - breaks apart with every bite! Just delicious. If I was on death rode I would choose DD to fill me with my last meal. WHY? Because the fresh, homemade food will definitely bring a smile to your face even if your about to die!   Thank you DD for making life so good....

Nothing like a weenier and a beer to get your weekend started right!   Met some friends at the Brat Haus to try the new place out.... and it was great! I liked it because it was different... brats, fries & beer! What more could you want! Oh yeah - home made pretzels! Everything was delicious!   I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a laid-back, chilled atmosphere with great food and beer of course!
