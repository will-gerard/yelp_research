I've been eating here for 22 years so that should say enough. Best pizza, try the Ellen, to DIE for! I love the vibe here, small, friendly and the kitchen is spotless.

Lunch here yesterday. Service was terrible and my friend was served her lunch without utensils. She asked for utensils and the waitress left and did not return. I got up and asked the hostess and she gave me attitude. I didn't get what I ordered but ate it anyway. The food was good. The fly buzzing our table was not. I'll never go here again. Bad service.

Dinner at Salvadoreno is a real treat. It's all so perfectly wonderful, exciting, delicious "to die for" food.

I had a great breakfast at Scramble and look forward to going again soon. Everything was fresh and delicious. I'm definitely going back to Scramble for breakfast again soon!

Sunny was so friendly and the food was beyond wonderful. It's worth the drive from N. Phoenix to Chandler. Clay pot was divine and I had leftovers for 2 days.

Curry chicken dish was thin and tasted like a little bit of curry in hot water. Chicken was pre-cooked and dry. Spring rolls were ok. Dipping sauce was horrible. It didn't suit the dish at all. Service was difficult as the staff doesn't speak English very well. Also waiter insulted me but I'm sure he didn't mean to (a comment about my weight). Worst part was when I smelled cigarette smoking coming from the kitchen. One guy denied it, the other guy admitted it. Bad food, I won't go there again.

It took me 5 years to notice that there was a restaurant here, it was hidden in plain sight! Love it! Can't wait to go back.
