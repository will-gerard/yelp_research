Flicka's is amazing!!! Flicka's couldn't have been a better setting for my 10 year high school reunion. Flicka helped with getting us all set up from food to drinks. I received so many compliments of the location, the setting, and the food. The food was perfect and all the guys were happy that they could go back for more. And of course our bartenders and waitresses were awesome! Thank you for making it a memorable night!

All I wanted was some grilled chicken after my workout. Was told they were out and only had wings. I was also not impressed with the service at the drive thru.

Came in for a beer before the game and it wasn't crazy busy but it had a good amount of customers. It took about 10 minutes for us to get service. We got water after she had passed our table and made eye contact several times. My water glass had definitely been spilled in the transport as it was half full. The waitress came back several minutes later and asked if we needed anything else. I asked for a ML and she said they didn't have Miller Lite but I could get a Coors Light. I was not offered an option of draft or bottle. It then took about another 10 minutes for me to get my beer. She had walked past our table several times. She finally made eye contact with me and realized that she had not brought me my beer. I watched her walk up to the bar and ask for the beer. This made me think that she had not even put in the order. After drinking the beer and going through water, the heat in the bar finally got to me, and I realized it was time to leave. Let me add that I asked for the check and then she disappeared and finally came around a few minutes later after she had delivered food and drinks to other tables. Finally came back with the check and disappeared again. Waited with my payment and then my boyfriend went to go find her and she took my money but needed to get change and disappeared again. Finally came back several minutes later with the change. I get it was game day but there were plenty of waitresses and what seemed like managers walking around.
