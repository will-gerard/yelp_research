Our granddaughter (she's 5) wanted Chinese food on New Year's Eve. We called and ordered to pick up. We got her fried shrimp and also ordered sweet and sour pork and teriyaki chicken. The shrimp was good, sweet and sour pork ok but the teriyaki chicken was definitely NOT chicken. I have no idea WHAT the meat was and needless to say we didn't eat it. We used to like Golden Wok when they were across the street and hoped this would be as good but I don't think we will be going back.

Our fav, love the margaritas. Shantelle is a great waitress, very attentive. They have a great patio, too.

A friend and I decided to meet for happy hour at this location tonight. We sat at the bar and I could immediately tell that our bartender was very busy. It took a few minutes for our drinks to come and it was very loud in the bar. I understand that when you work in a bar/restaurant that you are busy and not aware of patrons but many times the wait staff literally yelled across my friend and I. We decided to sit outside where it was quieter but once we got out there nobody ever checked on us. I would have purchased another drink but we were left out there a long time with no contact. It would have been very easy to just leave without paying but we came in and stood at the bar for our checks. I do think that the bartender would have been more attentive and friendly if she wasn't running like a maniac to keep up. It seems they need a other bartender. It was way too loud and annoying for a relaxing happy hour and we won't be back.

Using my last prepaid wash today and won't be back. Slow service, rude cashier AND they are blasting country music while I wait. This place has gone way downhill

Terrible service! A group of us came in for lunch today and were seated at small table for 6. Our 7th person came in and we asked if we could move a small table over to give us room to eat. The waitress was going to allow it but the manager (male) came out to say that we could not have an additional table because he would need it for the upcoming U of A game which was starting in an hour and a half. We were going to eat lunch and have cocktails but decided instead to leave since it was such a burden to serve us. Z Tejas was more than happy to take our business.

My hubby and I went to one in Michigan a couple of years ago and were looking forward to trying the new one. He made a reservation for us and when we arrived we were seated right away. Our server, Austin was very attentive and took great care of us. The coconut shrimp was so good, a bit spicy but great flavor. I got the Mahi Mahi and my hubby got the filet mignon. The Mahi was cooked perfectly but my hubby's medium rare filet arrived well done. Austin commented that it wasn't the first time that had happened. They quickly brought another and it was cooked just right. We had chocolate creme brûlée which was really good. Other than the issue with the filet being over cooked the rest of the meal was very good. We ate there on a busy valentines night but were in and out in about an hour. We will be going back soon.
