Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!  We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking.   Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.

Went here today in search of new dog food for my Teddy ... This store is BIG. Lots of different kinds of food, cheaper than most stores I've been to, the staff is super friendly and helpful. It is clean and nice and has toys, collars and meds. They carry other supplies/food for small animals and cats too! I love this store and definitely will be back!!!

FINALLY! ....A groomer that I have returned to the 2nd time and intend on returning to many more times.  I have a 7lb Morkie that I take to her, he has Maltese fur so I grow it out long on his body but i keep everything else short. I don't know why that's so hard to understand at any other groomers, but they keep messing up! Here are the selling points...  1.) Prices range between 15-25 for the trims. This includes nails, sanitary areas, paws and face trims and of course the bath and brush out. 2.) She welcomes constructive criticism and always tells me if there's something I don't like or want done, I have to tell her...she promises after a few times we will get his style just PERFECT for me. 3.) She offers standing grooming appointments (these are trims only) that are 2 weeks apart and charges only $15.  For someone's dog who needs a FULL groom ...the first time will be the more expensive groom then everything afterwards would be to keep up the cut.  Teddy gets so tired by the time he gets picked up he just usually sleeps. She doesn't kennel her dogs so they get to run around and play with toys and other dogs there. I love going to Lori and her daughter. I 1000000% recommend them to EVERYONE who has a pet. So far, I've recommended them to 2 of my neighbors already!  Lori says her business does not advertise so it's all word by mouth referrals.....I say if that's the case, she's doing a pretty damn good job seeing that she's been in the same location for 7 years.   :)  Come visit Lori. She's gonna make you AND your pet very happy.

I love this store. Everything is under $1.00 as promised. They've got tons of canned food and for someone who is single and lives alone, this is the best way to spend your money. The portions are usually single person size. They have everything from spices to bread to tupperware.   I go to this store once a week and get MOST of everything i need and it usually comes out to about $25. This is definitely not possible at Safeway, Walmart, or a CVS store.   It is also pretty clean and big. A bit crowded on the weekends.

Dear Seattle Supersonics and Howard Schultz,  I have forsaken Starbucks coffee since moving to AZ.  For one thing, Mr. Schultz, you suck (for selling the Sonics and for making a Grande latte $4.50).  I have moved on.  I am now--not so secretly--in love with Lux.  I get a "medium", otherwise known as grande to you, for $2.75 AND......ANDDDDD.......and my barista free pours the vanilla syrup.  I mean, it also tastes orgasmic, the coffee, that is.  By the way, I think their pastries are homemade.  Either way, their pastries are a DELIGHT!!  I always get the mixed berry corn bread muffin ($2.75) to go with my latte.    Sincerely,  A serious coffee addict  On a more serious note, they have outside seating with misters when the weather is scorching hot.  Since it's fall, the weather's been a lot nicer and this is a great hang out spot. They have their own parking and accept all major credit cards.  Their baristas are friendly and remember your name. This is a great place to get coffee and breakfast. No, they are not a franchise so you may have to drive a ways if you don't live in central phx...but hey, this is what makes their coffee affordable, orgasmic and worthwhile.  You should try them...at least once.

Let me start off by saying that I only gave 4 stars because I'm not a Gelato expert, I've only had gelato a few times in my life ...but this is the best I've ever had...not necessarily the best out there.  They offer coffee as well as gelato here. Their coffee is always amazing and I WILL say that I am a coffee connoisseur. There must be at least 20 different flavors of gelato to choose from in addition to other ice cream treats such as cakes or banana splits.  They have couches as well as tables located inside where it's air conditioned. Just tables and chairs outside if you want to people watch.    Definitely a good spot to go for dessert maybe after a first date? :)  or just a good hang out spot with friends.

I've always been one to say, "Pass!" to pizza. But since it was my birthday, my friend took me here for dinner...and when someone offers to take you out for your birthday, who says, "hell no, I'm not eating that!"  So I went.  Let me start with the ambiance of the place. The restaurant is actually a house, it looked very homey. We opted to sit outside in front because it was late evening and we saw they had misters...plus, the decorations outside looked so romantic and sweet. Definitely a good choice for a first date! Or ...the 100th date.   Now on to the food.  He ordered for us but I got to choose the dessert, and yes, I asked for it to come out FIRST.  It was a crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.  At first I said, "damn, $12 for a crepe?" Man, that was amazing.  And well worth more than $12.  We got two pizzas, they were about 8 inches around and it can probably feed a party of 2 (but since we had a huge crepe before, we had to take some pizza togo). My pizza had prosciutto topped with fresh, organic arugula. The crust was thin and very tasteful. I couldn't get enough of it. His pizza had salami, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. Also quite delectable.  Our waiter was very nice, he knew we were talkers so he left us alone to do so. After we were done eating, we wanted to get some coffee but it was 10:30pm on a Sunday night and no one was opened.  Again, our waiter came to the rescue and told us about a local coffee house down the street, about 5 minutes away.  We went there and it was amazing too!....but that's a different review.  :)  To say that I recommend Cibo would not express how I really feel about my experience there.  Let's just say, since that day, I've had dreams about my prosciutto topped with arugula pizza EVERY NIGHT!

Pita Jungle, where have you been all my life???....  Grabbed lunch with my Medical Director here the other day, kinda nervous cus you know...it's the MEDICAL DIRECTOR.   They asked if we wanted inside seating, outside seating or first available. I blurted first available and she said she had a table right away. I think the big guy wanted to sit inside cus it was kinda warm outside.  Anyway, I wanted to order the Seared Tuna with Hummas but that was like $10 and his salad was more like $7 so I went with the Hummas with Taboule which was about $7.  Taboule is considered a salad I guess, I was sorta expecting lettuce and whatever but it's actually a bunch of chopped cilantro mixed with onions and lime...?  Then it was piled on top of their AMAZING hummas....OMG.... *drools again just thinking about it*  Served with 2 good sized pita breads, this was a fantastic lunch for me!  I even had enough left overs for dinner. The Taboule was surprisingly delicious and the hummas was orgasmic.  I will definitely come back again!

Just had lunch at Bobby Q. We had the sample platter which came with beef brisket, one side, St. Louis ribs and smoked chicken (which we substituted for more beef brisket) and the beef brisket sandwich. Everything was incredibly GOOD!!! our server saw that we were sharing the strawberry lemonade and ignoring the iced tea so brought out another strawberry lemonade free of charge!!! We were served corn bread as we waited for our food which came out super fast. All that and our bill was only $26!! I definitely recommend this place! And if you tell them you found them on yelp, you get 10% off your bill.

The slice of pizza is as big as my hand...and the toppings were piled so high, i think it touched my nose when I bit down.  I usually get the Slice Special for $3.50. It has 6 toppings and is just delicious!!!  I've also tried their Spaghetti with Meatballs and I'd say this dish is ...alright.  I would prefer a little more sauce and a little more salt but hey....it comes with a 12-inch garlic loaf...and it's huge and only costs $7.25  The restaurant is quite busy Friday and Saturday nights, expect your to go order to take between 25-25 minutes if you aren't ordering just pizza by the slice.  On a regular day, maybe 20 minutes so I'd really call it in.  Sit down orders are faster than the to go orders even on their busy nights.  The staff is very sweet and nice.   My goal:  try the wings next time cus ...man they looked GOOD when the other guy took it to his table!

Based on all the yelp reviews, my Mesa friend and I came here for dinner tonight.  It was a fantastic choice.  Our waiter was super nice and super quick.  The atmosphere was dim and cozy.  Definitely would not recommend this for a big group though, it would be a bit cramped.    Here's what we ordered:  1.) Ika Kara Age (Sweet butter marinated squid breaded to a crunchy finish)  -  This dish was DELICIOUS, the squid was cooked just right! It wasn't chewy, rubbery or overcooked. It was tender, just enough flavor ...and many pieces in one order!  2.)  Agadashi Tofu (Lightly cooked tofu served in tempura sauce with bonito)  -  This dish was a little bland, you'd think that since tofu doesn't have much flavor...the majority of the flavor would be in the sauce. But no.  We had to sprinkle salt into the sauce ..which then made it better.  3.)  Umi No Sachi  (A sashimi salad)  -  A bed of mixed greens, HUGE chunks of sashimi all drizzled with a creamy white sauce.  This was the highlight of our dinner. I've never seen a sashimi salad for $16 that had this much sashimi that was so fresh, cut into such big slices before.  I absolutely give this dish 5stars!!!!!!!  You HAVE TO try this.  4.) Alaskan Roll -  A california roll wrapped with raw salmon.  You think, what's so special right? There must have been a secret sauce they put inside this roll because you got this amazing after taste...that just made you want to take another piece and another piece....and another piece...  5.)  Philadelphia Roll  -  A roll with cream cheese and salmon.  This was average, nothing significant but i was happy.  6.) Spicy Tuna Roll -  REALLY good spicy tuna roll, made me regret not ordering a spicy tuna hand roll....i bet that would have been orgasmic.    All the more reason to revisit!!    :)

This is a chain of the Cheesecake Factory owners.  Didn't know that until we sat down.  I've never had a good experience eating at Cheesecake Factory, their food always gave me....forgive the bluntness ....but runs.  I swear. Ate there 3x ...and got sick all 3x.  I have never eaten there again.  Anyway, I gave Grand Lux Cafe 1 star for its decor and its extensive menu. They have A LOT of choices and they range from sushi to steak to burgers.   We got their buffalo chicken rolls for the appetizer and burgers for entree.  They get 1 more star for the portions, my God....they were HUGE. Shoulda shared the food...  But in the end, that is all they got since..yep, you guessed it....i got sick after I ate there!!! .....  Eat at your own risk, people.

Nails by Tina took my pedicure virginity from me.  And I would keep coming back...even though it hurt.  No seriously, the girl who did my pedicure did a good job with the massage for my legs  and shoulder and painting my toe nails and drawing a beautiful flower on it, but i think she was a little rough on them when she was cutting the nails and cuticle because some of my toes still hurt to the touch.   Anyway, Monica was my nail tech who did my manicure and she was SOOOO good.  She was very gentle and did a phenomenal job of my hands!  I left there looking like a princess who never touched dishwater in her life! She's definitely gonna be doing my pedicure next time!  She doesn't speak much English but lucky for me, I speak Vietnamese so I was able to conversate with her.  If you don't mind not having someone to chat to while you're getting your nails done, DEFINITELY ask for Monica by name!    As for their color choices, there were many but most were not OPI (which lasts much longer on your nails than other brands) and the colors were not particularly my taste.  Next time, i will bring my own color.  :)  But i definitely loved being able to do a mani/pedi at the same time!  Cuts the time I have to sit there in half!  They have 15 nail techs on staff daily so you do  not need to make an appointment, just show up and you'll be helped.  But if you want to be sure, go ahead and call in to set one.

I was craving hummus and my friend almost ripped my head off when I suggested Pita Jungle ...so there we were ..at Pars on a weekday night. We were both Pars virgins but the reviews had been good so we tried.  He ordered the Chef's special --ground beef, chicken filet, and filet mignon on skewers. It was served with basmati rice and grilled tomatoes.  This dish was $30, we shouldn't have been so greedy and ordered a second dish.  My dish was the Beef Shish which also came with basmati rice.  We also ordered the hummus I was so craving for.  Let me start by telling you the Chefs Special could serve a party of 3!!! My god, when the plate came out, I already started my food coma just looking at it.  The 3 meat combo was ...ORGASMIC! The rice was soft and cooked just right. My beef shish was so so, I wish I had just eaten off my friend's plate. :)  The hummus was VERY GOOD...we asked for extra pita bread just to wipe the plate clean.  Now on to the atmosphere. There is a little patio for outside seating if you're interested. The inside has a bar and...well, when I first walked in, I almost choked. The smell was ....overwhelming. In a bad way.  This is a horrible way to describe the smell and I'm sorry....but I thought I was walking in to a rest stop restroom.  /)_(\ SORRY!! My friend tells me that's how Persian food is supposed to smell like!!  But man...it took a good 30 minutes before my nose was accustomed to the smell.  Aside from the smell, cus I know it's just me.......I gave this restaurant 5 stars for the quality of the food, the fast and friendly service as well as price.  I WILL come back....and breathe through my mouth only for the 1st 30 minutes next time.   Just because they're worth it.  hehe.

I'm Vietnamese and recently moved here from Seattle.   I've been looking for a pho joint for weeks, this was my first (and last) time I'll eat here.   The noodles were way too soggy and there was way too much noodles in the bowl. There were literally 5 slices of meat and just broth. I was given only one stem of basil and a piece of lime so small it was insignificant.   The only good thing about my lunch was the waiter - he was polite. But maybe that's bcus I'm Vietnamese. Who knows.

Noble Beast is a small store with limited products. They've got a ton of dog food but only a small wall of toys and a corner for bedding. If you're looking for pet food, chk out Pet Food Depot, if you're looking for dog toys/clothes/beds, chk out Petsmart. Overall, I don't recommend Noble Beast bcus I found nothing interesting and even if I did, it'd be overpriced. I would give this a half star if I could...and only bcus they have a parking lot.

I don't have a sweet tooth, however, I did one day when I pranced into this fabulous ...family owned and operated ...Deli?  I spotted a cute little coconut creme pie about 2 inches in radius and I thought...maybe just today.    Then I tried their Portabello Stuffed Mushroom (LOVE IT!!!) and their Italian Chef Salad.  Barb....(the owner) you make the meanest Italian Chef Salad EVER! I'm so hooked.  If anyone is familiar with my postings, I've been searching high and low for a cobb salad here....forget the cobb. It's ALL about the Italian Chef now.  The salad was $10.50 but well worth it with all the meat that's piled on there. The coconut creme pie was $4 which is a bit pricey but it's delivered ...it's not made there. The Portabello was $4.95 i think...and that was WELL worth it.  D'licious Dishes...you've won my heart....one coconut creme pie at a time....

I've ordered take out here twice.  Both times were very positive.  First time I tried it was when I first moved here in the Spring when it was like 100 degrees already.  I have 2 dogs that I had to leave in the car (with the engine and A/C on) while I ran inside to place my order.  I told the waitress I'd just be outside the door because of my dogs so I'll come in to get my food.  Instead of waiting for me to come in to get it....she came out and handed to me!!  How nice!  Second time I came here was a few days ago when the temperature has cooled down a lot. But, again, I left the dogs in the car with the engine on and the A/C going.  And AGAIN!....she ran out and gave me my food!    I love their service and their Sherwarma gyro is freakin awesome-tastic.

I was in the area one Sunday and decided to have lunch here. I looked at the name and thought....oh my...this is probably gonna be a mistake. Who names their restaurant something that corny and have good food!??  Boy, was I wrong!   The owner was very polite and nice, he was constantly checking up on us while we ate to make sure we got everything. The pho was ....."unphogettable"!!!! .....  I must say this is the best pho I've had since Seattle.  They had the pho out in like, 5 mins also...which is how long pho SHOULD take to make at a restaurant level.  I was very satisfied with the service and the food.

This is my 3rd time in for the $9.99 oil change except this time I needed to get my radiator hoses changed too. The 1st two times I had no problems and service was good and quick.  On 12/3/10 I took my car in, got an estimate of $390 something dollars for an oil change and new radiator hoses. Are you fucking kidding me?! My brother is a mechanic so I called him and made Scott, the manager talk to me. Scott knocked the price down to $125+ tax ($140 total).  The job took an hr. I went home and parked the car until Saturday night and drive it 25 miles to west Phoenix....MY CAR OVER HEATED AND BROKE DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD!!! my car is not new but it sure as hell had no problems before this. I spent 4 hours stranded....good thing a good Samaritan helped me get the car back home. The guy that helped me along with a police officer told me the radiator hoses were either wrong or not put on tight. It didnt look secure.   I had planned to move back home to Seattle on Sunday morning but now that my car wasn't drive-able and they aren't open Sundays (I was told), I had to delay my move until Monday 12/6/10.  First he told me the wait would be 1.5 hours...which turned into 3 hours...then he said my it wasn't his fault that the water hoses busted. It was my fault because my radiator leaked--i have NEVER had ANY issues with my car before this point...EVER. Anyways, he charged me another $200 (his original estimate was $325!!!) for a new radiator. We waited another hour and he said the radiator wasn't the problem, it was the thermostat...then he said it was my head gasket ...and now it would cost me $1000+ to fix.  What kind of bullshit business is this? I come in for an oil change and new water hoses...and ended up with a car that doesn't even drive anymore unless i put in another $1000 on it.    DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE. While we waited, there were 4 other customers who brought their car back to complain about persistent problems after getting their car fixed there.  I am filing a claim with the Better Business Bureau.
