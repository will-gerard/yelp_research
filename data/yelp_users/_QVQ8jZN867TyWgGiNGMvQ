Came here around midnight-ish on a Friday night because as a Purdue student I wanted to hit up some UW Madison college bars.   This place was nice- good crowd, good service, good music, and good specials. No complaints.  I liked the indoor and outdoor seating arrangements with the dance area upstairs.   I'd come back during the day to try the restaurant food here as well.

Yummmy!!!  Last weekend I was visiting Scottsdale with my mom and we met up with a friend of mine here. That was definitely a good choice :)  Pros- - Lots of options on the menu, and they are clearly explained so there is minimal confusion - Every dish has the option to be changed (perfect for picky eaters like myself!) - Generous portion sizes - Fair prices, nothing was over $20 - The staff was very personable! Such nice people who love what they do! - Efficient service  Cons- - I ordered a side of noodles and never got them :(  But above all else DON'T FORGET TO: TRY THEIR NEW SPRING ROLLS BTW. I forgot the name, but it's the Chicken ones on their latest menu. SOOOO good!

If there was a mall in heaven, this would be it!  Whether you are in the mood to splurge or bargain hunt, this mall has absolutely everything. All of the stores also are "full sized" aka plenty of selection!   The mall has a perfect location in Old Town, and has ample parking so even on a packed Saturday when I went, there is no trouble finding a spot!   Concisely (and so I don't ramble, because I totes could--loveee this mall!):  Pros- - EVERY STORE POSSIBLE, perfect for all budgets - Clean, nice atmosphere and good crowd of people - Stores are all full sized with good selection - Convenient location - Many restaurant choices - Easy to navigate and plenty of maps if it is your first time  Cons- - You'll get tired from all the shopping but ummm that's not necessarily a bad thing :)

I came here because I was visiting a friend in Madison and we wanted to go to a place that had good food and a nice atmosphere. The Cannery seemed like a good choice contrary to the negative Yelp reviews. But, we should have listened to Yelp because above all else, the food was not good.  The service surprisingly was- I had no issues at all with it, and the host and our server were great. = One star given above  The atmosphere was nice, as was the convenient location = second star given  But some things were odd- 1. The empty dining room on a Saturday night....this place should be a little more crowded eh?  We shared the cheese curds to start, but honestly it's Wisconsin can anyone really mess those up?  Next, I had a cup of chicken noodle soup, the flavoring was very strange and I didn't really like it. Needed salt and less of whatever they put in it.   For my meal I had the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. THIS WAS NOT GOOD DO NOT GET IT. It was so spicy, and the chicken had a weird consistency, I'm really not sure if it was cooked. The sauce was gross too.   The other people at my table were somewhat satisfied with their food but we won't be back unless it's just to drink or something. Def not for food aside from appetizers though.

I came here with my mom last weekend when I was visiting Scottsdale, and it was awesome. We can early enough, around 8am so there wasn't a wait but when we left at 9ish, the line was out the door.  Here are my pros: - Huge, diverse and well explained menu. There is something for everyone here. I was boring and got the basic eggs and sausage plate, and it was delicious but I should have been adventurous. Mom got the Denver Omelette and she finished it wish a huge grin, loved it! - Pets are allowed! As a dog lover I couldn't be happier that this was a pet friendly place. - Price, very fair! Nothing was really over $12 and the portions were generous. - Healthy and fresh ingredients  Cons: - At times the wait was a little much but it's popular so what can we expect?   Overall, be sure to try it if you're in the area!

This mall- eh  It's not horrible, but it's a waste of time.   I visited from out of town and it was not worth my while.  The stores were your typical "upscale" shops, but good luck finding anything with the pacs of shoppers looking to score "deals".   The only stores worth going to are Gap outlet and J Crew factory. I was excited when I saw H&M but don't be fooled, it's not an outlet store so no "special" deals there.  Avoid the crowds, save the gas $ and go elsewhere.   Pros: - I got 2 dresses at Gap outlet for less than $20  Cons: - Crowded - Lack of selection - Not all stores are outlets even though this is an outlet mall - No food courts and when you put your credit card in the vending machine good luck getting your drink
