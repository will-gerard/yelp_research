Love this place! It's huge, for one, has a great selection of new and used in addition to gifts, etc. Only prob is parking, but that's not really their fault -- it's the stupid  construction that's been going on since the beginning of time. And the staff is great. Recommended.

I LOVE this place! The staff is incredible and so knowledgeable -- not to mention they are actually from Italy. It's definitely a special-occasion place though -- not for the everyday unless you're made of cashola. Great atmosphere, great food. Also you can sign up for their e-mails which tell you about upcoming wine tastings, special menus, etc. Four thumbs up (two from me, two from hubby).

On the small side, but a great collection of modern and vintage racers. It's also air -conditioned and free. Beware if you bring kids - it's tough to keep them from touching cars/ running around, and the lady up front was watching us like a hawk. Bonus: if you're feeling brave, you can take the kiddos outside or to the dealerships next door to see Maseratis, Lamborghinis and Ferraris.

Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi.

I've been to three Pizza Picazzo locations, and this one absolutely blew,. The reason? Service with a capital S. I invited a very large group out to lunch (made reservations the day before).  The waitress was rude, rude, rude and completely incompetent. When someone asked how large the slices were, she answered 'regular." We kept waiting for her to laugh or smile, but she never did. It turned out "regular" was her answer to just about everything -- we now use "regular" as an inside joke at the office. She also kept us waiting AT LEAST an hour and a half for the check and was largely a mirage during the entire meal. Worst service EVER.   Food was good (though I agree that it could be considered overpriced), but that was completely overshadowed by the horrible service.

He has been my and my husband's dentist for about three years, and I definitely recommend.  He and the staff are eternally friendly and helpful, and always remember my name. They even send me birthday cards. The office is very clean and the parking is great. The only reason they don't get five stars is because they keep hounding me about purchasing Invisalign, even though I've made it clear that I simply can't afford it right now (much as I would love to have my teeth fixed -- trust me). I asked them if it was medically necessary, and they said no. If they would just lay off the hard sell, they'd have five stars.

I am extraordinarily disappointed with the recent service my daughter and I have received at Cool Cuts recently. We have been loyal customers for a long time, but are now considering taking our business elsewhere. On our most recent visit, I arrived and was told they had no record of an appointment for us. I had made the appointment a mere 4 hours before at that location, and it was confirmed by an employee on the phone. On on our previous visit, despite again having a confirmed appointment, we were forced to wait 30 minutes before being seen. This is ridiculous.

We ended up leaving Arrowhead after about 3 years. My daughter is extremely afraid of the dentist. Despite her history, they would refuse to let me go back with her until she was already freaking out. THEN they would let me come back. On top of that, I was made to feel like there was a problem with my parenting skills because of her anxiety. We switched to a new dentist who doesn't have a problem letting parents stay with their kids-her first visit went extremely well.

I love this place -- been going here for more than 15 years. The kitschy decor and sense that you've time-warped back to 1983 only add to the appeal. It's a sandwich shop, for heaven's sake, not a gourmet restaurant. Anyway, if your company sucks, at least you can laugh at the bumper stickers and goofy photos of circa-1980s teens.

I LOVE this place. The service is always excellent, the place is eternally clean, and you go home knowing that your arteries aren't turning to steel. And I love that they are usually playing classical music in the background. Plus, you get free refills, free soft serve/yogurt, free soup...love it.   The trick in getting the most for your money is to pile the meat/veggies a couple of inches ABOVE your bowl, because it really cooks down once the guy throws it on the big griller for you.

LOVE IT! The only flaw I saw was that the place is very tiny and the tables are quite limited. So you might have a bit of a wait. Other than that, the food is unique and tasty, and the man who runs the restaurant was extremely affable, friendly and helpful. Everybody eat here!!!

I like this place..cute and neighborly. The food was also tasty and the owners/employees were very friendly and helpful. The problem was that the owner/proprietor/manager couldn't make a chai latte to save her life. (They were on the menu, so it's not like I made a special order). It took her a good 20-30 minutes of me standing there for her to track down the ingredients in the cupboards, then concoct the thing. She was very apologetic, but it was still a bit inconvenient and odd considering it was a coffee shop.  Nevertheless, I'm certainly willing give it a second chance, especially since I haven't tried the food yet...

I really liked this place. Not only is the atmosphere great, so was the paella! Plus they had flamenco dancers shakin' their hips through the place at random moments...how fun is that? Later on they actually performed on a little stage. The best part was when they ask who was having a birthday, and I pointed out my whitebread, farm-boy Minnesota-born husband. They pulled him right up there so he could shake his groove thang. Highlight of the evening.

Fez was wonderful! Went there for a "pre-Valentine's Day" dinner with DH. The atmosphere is very hip and modern, complete with video wall and dance club-ish music. The sweet potato fries with cinnamon were AMAZING. I never knew sweet potatoes could taste that good. The black bean burger was fairly good, although I've had better. Service was competent but not over-the-top great. Love the location too.

LOVE this place! The soup was especially delicious. The best part is, it keeps my husband the meat-eater and his wife the vegetarian equally happy.  And the prices are unbeatable. I have yet to have a bad meal here.

Food was pretty good, service was HORRIBLE. I went to the Scottsdale location. There really isn't a space set aside for pick up and/or ordering. There's just an island with the servers' computers, and a bunch of patrons standing around confused. A disorganized MESS.

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT go here!!!  On weekends, you will be forced to wait a minimum of TWO HOURS just for them to tell you what your stuff is worth, and even then you are likely to get less than $10. I had brand-new clothing and they gave me a whopping $3.50. Horrible customer service. Run, don't walk, from this place.

I love this place! It's one of two Flo's within about five miles (the other is at the Scottsdale Promenade, and from what I understand the menu/focus is somewhat different).  This one is at McDowell Mountain Village (same strip mall as an AJ's)  kind of a corporate hangout for people who work in the area, like myself.   They've recently changed and expanded the menu a bit, and it includes more vegetarian options (yay!) I especially enjoy the Crispy Tofu and Vegetables. Each meals comes with a green salad with the world's most delicious dressing -- kind of spicy, kind of sweet. The wontons with dipping sauce are also delish.   Service is quick and friendly. Parking can be an issue, and the place fills up fast during weekday lunch hours.

The magazine is great. Only one problem: They never paid me for my article. I am owed $300 for an article I wrote in November 2006. The article was huge and took a ton of work and a lot of time to complete. They are in dire financial straits and have left many freelancers high and dry with regard to payment for past work. If you are a freelancer, run, don't walk, away from this magazine. I'm glad Lily A., who posted below got paid, but as of April 2008, I haven't seen one thin dime and the editors have stopped communicating with me. Makes me sick.

I only have two "complaints" about this place: One, it is too far from my house in Surprise. Second, the selection makes it really hard to choose what to buy. That aside, this place is worth the drive if you are looking for "exotic" plants and an owner who is actually willing to help you make an educated decision about what to buy and how to care for it. As a planting  rookie (at least when it comes to edibles), I needed someone who would be willing to take the time to answer questions (even stupid ones) and provide information about how to keep my new plants alive. The owner did not disappoint. One word of advice: The place is outdoors and tends to be very muddy, so wear old shoes and clothes and be prepared to go on a "hunt" to find exactly what you want. It is worth the time.

I really like this place! It's a LITTLE more pricey than I'm used to, but it's worth to get a good cut and help figuring out which cut/style is best. You get what you pay for. I don't think they're outrageous, though. I had Deanna, and she was wonderful. They lost a star bec. the woman at the front desk was not particularly friendly or welcoming when I came in and when I left. But that's being a bit nitpicky. Bonus for the unexpected neck/scalp massage when I got my hair washed. Nice. : ) WIll definitely be back!

LOVE it here! I used to go to the full-size Wal-Mart on 59th and Olive, but it was ALWAYS a madhouse, and let's face it: the neighborhood ain't the hottest, especially in the evening. Not only is this location more convenient for me, it is cleaner and not NEARLY as crowded. Another plus is that if you just need a couple items, you don't have to walk across a massive store to get them (and that's a good thing when you're seven months pregnant). Obviously, they don't have everything a regular Wal-Mart carries, but for your average everyday stuff, they do. Lines -- even on Saturday and Sunday are either very short or non-existent. And the parking is a breeze. Awesome!  One funny thing -- they have those security carts where the wheels lock up if you go over the yellow line -- I wasn't paying attention to where I parked the first time out and I found myself with a locked up cart full of bags. So watch where you park if you have more than a couple bags or something heavy.

This location is at Chauncey Ranch, just south of the 101, in the new Whole Foods plaza. It has not only the Destination Maternity, it has a higher end Mimi Maternity and luxury brand Pea in the Pod at the same location, along with an Edamame Spa.  With that out of the way -- I REALLY wanted to like this place. I went to the old location at Desert Ridge and was pleased with the low cost, big selection and service. The atmosphere was laid back and casual.  Unfortunately, at this location, you will be immediately attacked by salespeople at every turn. In my first visit, I was stopped at least seven or eight times by people asking if I wanted help or wanted to visit the spa. Since it was close to the grand opening, I let it go at overzealousness. However, a few months later I got the same experience. I appreciate the helpfulness, and I understand what it's like to work on commission, but they stick to you like white on rice and make the experience really annoying. I've started either shopping at their online store, visiting other locations or going to different stores. Other than that, the prices are pretty OK as long as you stick to the clearance section at Destination -- the other two places are ridiculously priced considering how long you WON'T be wearing the clothes.

Don't let the location (off in the boonies, in a strip mall) fool you.  I was thrilled with the service I got. Angela did a great job helping me figure out what would work with my fine, limp hair and being honest about what wouldn't. Will definitely go back!

First off, let me say that my experience with the dental staff was excellent. The dentists and hygienists were kind, patient and knowledgeable. My issue is with the front office. They are incommunicado. At other dental practices, I was mailed reminders or called when an appointment was scheduled or needed to be scheduled. Not so here, even when I went a YEAR between visits. When you have only two visits in any given year, this is common courtesy. Secondly, their Web site has a section in which you can request an appointment by noting your preferred day of the week, time, etc. Yet on more than one occasion, the information fell into a black hole, and I never heard back from them. Sorry, Martineau, but I would recommend retraining your front office staff. If you don't care enough to keep in touch with your patients and remind them that you value their business, they will go elsewhere, as I am now doing. Thank you.

Shared the gingerbread fro-yo with my 2-year-old. I LOVED that it was all self-serve! I didn't feel rushed to make up my mind or freak out over getting the "wrong" flavor or toppings. It also allows you to choose just how much you want, rather than be forced to a pick a size. (Even a small is sometimes tough for me to finish at other fro-yo places). I also liked that the flavors and toppings were somewhat unique. It was also very CLEAN. Will definitely be back!

My husband and I loved Saigon Kitchen. Unfortunately, they were out of vegetarian broth (I'm a vegetarian), so a couple of menu items were out for me - pho included. Disappointing. Otherwise we had a great experience and were pleased with the fried rice, salad and salmon. Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We will return.

I used to like this store. However, making a return is now an absolute nightmare. There is either only one person at the counter ( or none), or they have greeters hold you hostage while they put yellow stickers on your returns. Word to the wise: Shop somewhere else if there is any chance you might need to make a return.

If you're buying, you can find plenty of decent deals. However, I wouldn't bother with trying to sell in any children's consignment store. I can bring in boxes of like-new items, and they will consistently only purchase five or six items. You spend an hour organizing and getting the stuff in the car, driving it down there, and then waiting two hours for them to decide what to buy before you drive back again. Not worth the hassle, folks. Put it all on Craigslist and be done with it.

Tried Dutch Bros. for the first time today. Great coffee and very friendly service. This may be beside the point, but what I like about DB is the utter lack of pretentiousness (are you listening, Sbux)? No earth tones, no snobby sizing, no flute-based world music playing, no snootieness about where my coffee beans originated from. The only downsides? I don't understand why they have two drive-through lanes, and I was too embarrassed to ask! I saw two menu boards in my lane, but no actual way to tell them my order. So I just drove up to the window and ordered there. Apparently they have some system where they come out to your car if there is a certain number of cars in line, but I didn't know that. Wish it was a bit more clear about how the process works. LOL. Second, the prices are a bit high. And they make me feel old considering everyone who works there looks like they just came from a casting call on a reality TV show for millennials. But I'm still hooked in spite of all that.

Very, very good. The texture of these donuts is lighter and crispier than a normal donut and they are all made fresh right in front of you. And the flavor combinations are very unique.
