Ever since I moved to the area I've been wanting to try this place.  Since we are now in walking distance, I wanted to make sure that I tried this place ASAP!  So last night, me and my man-friend decided to run out for a quick dinner and decided that Fate was at the top of our list!  We showed up and was a bit confused by the bar outside...but after we sat down, our waiter explained that the bar next door (which plays GREAT dance music) is associated to Fate...but a different "entity".  One more comment about the bar...there is a big patio that is going to be awesome for the quickly approaching summer!  So back to Fate...we tried the Pot Stickers which were really good and some cocktails.  Man-friend tried the Cucumber Kamikaze, which was AWESOME!  For dinner we had the Pad Thai w/Chicken and Szechwan Beef.   Both were good and extra spicy!  The spice here is not for the faint of hearts...it's the real deal.  Bring some tissues to wipe your brow and your nose! ;)  One final great touch with Fate was the little miniature cookies that they give you with your bill.  These airy little cookies taste like vanilla wafers...and I can't wait to go back for more!  The service was good and we had a great time!  I If you are in the neighborhood, you've gotta stop by.  They have a cool outside bar as well.  One final note...our waiter shared with us that Fate is open until 2:30am with full menu service on the weekends...so if you are Downtown after a night of drinking...swing by here and grab a midnight snack.    4/2008 ~Update~   After eating at Wild Thaiger...which isn't too far away, this place definitely seems lacking.  Less flavorful and not as authentic.  If I ever had a choice between the two, I would pick Wild Thaiger in a heartbeat!

One thing to say about this place...You MUST get the Meat & Potatoes appetizer.  Hands down one of the best appetizers I've ever had anywhere, and paired with a salad, I could contemplate just eating this for dinner.  This place is SUPER cute and "romantic".  They offer BYOB service which is great...you can bring your own favorite wine/beer!   The food was wonderful and the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable in what they were serving and made some good recommendations.   I can't wait to go back!

Moto is one of the few sushi places near DT that I know of...on top of it being centrally located, it also has some pretty damn good sushi!  I have not been too adventurous with the menu...I normally always get the standard (a sake bomber, edamame, a roll, and some sashimi) but my co-diner decided to be gutsy and try  "The Exit Wound" is possibly the hottest noodle bowl in the Southwest...so watch out!  After that bowl, cool off with their ice cream sushi...it's two or sometimes three different types of ice cream (it's always a surprise and they won't tell you ahead of time what type of ice cream they are using for the night) and then rolled in rice crispies...definitely yummy.  Two chopsticks up! :)

OK seriously.  This could be one of Arizona's hidden treasures.  I almost don't want to share this, because it will eventually mean long lines for me.  This is a corner store (appropriately on the corner) of 56th Street and Indian School.  It at some time was probably a 7-11 or Circle K.  But they have THE BEST sandwiches in town.  When you walk in, it's a little sketchy.  So don't say you haven't been warned.  It is a convenience store and in a corner of the store they also happen to make sandwiches.    If you aren't scared away, then you are in luck, because this corner of the store is where all the magic happens.  You ask the Asian guy at the counter for a slip and you write down your sandwich order.  He then hands it to the Asian guy in the corner who will then make your sandwich.    They use Boar's Head meats and aren't stingy with it!  I had a roast beef sandwich that had at least 2 inches of meat on it...and with all the toppings, my sandwich was only $6!    Plus, since it's a grocery store/gas station type place, you can grab some chips, nuts, drinks, beer, wine...whatever you need to go with your sammie.  I passed on the beer/wine since I was headed back to work to eat my sandwich at my desk. I recommend that you too get your sandwich and sides "to go"...since it's a corner store, there is no where to "sit and eat" unless you like eating in your car...and I have a really weird aversion to people who eat in their cars.  OR...you can dine in the AZ summer heat at a picnic table that is in the parking lot.  But, the table was taken today by a truck full of construction workers who obviously also learned about this wonderful sandwich shop.  Anyway, if you work or live in the area, you need to give this place a try...it is truly one of the best sandwiches I've had in at least a year or two.  I will be going back...REAL SOON.

Great Italian food and served in a super cute atmosphere.  The service was good and our waiter was very attentive to our table. The food was great...we started with the Gnocchi which was wonderful! I had the Chicken Marsala and also tried some of the Lasagna...both were fantastic.  The best part of the night was the wonderful Chianti that was suggested to us and the shot of Sambuca that was brought to us after our dinner, compliments of the house.  i would give this place a try if you are looking for a great Italian dinner...everyone that has been from my recommendation, LOVED it. :)

Alright...I ventured out for dinner last night in my new area...Portland's was on the top of the list due to it's decent reviews and the extremely close proximity to our home.  We walked in and found the restaurant to be a little "cold" with the decor.  Modern and on the dark side.  The bar area was cute, however we decided to grab a dinner table.  After finally getting someones attention after walking around the entrance for a bit, we were seated and ordered some wine.    We started with Crab cakes which we rated a "5" out of "10".  Not awesome...not horrible.  So far so good.  For entrees I decided on the Chicken Phylo and my co-diner got the Ostrich (don't ask me why...guess he was feeling "wild").  The waiter described the Ostrich as "irony"...boy was it ever.  It literally tasted like blood.  However I do have to say, what the hell do you expect when the description is "irony". Ha!  Either way, it was not appeasing to me...or my co-diner.  My chicken was decent so I don't really have much to complain about there.  I give it a 4.  Luckily we  were able to score some lasagna from my new neighbors when we got home...so we did not have to go to bed hungry.    I wouldn't waste my time going back to this spot with all of the other local places in the area.  If you do decide to go...PASS on the Ostrich. ;)

You must sit at the dining counter.  Chef Nobu is a master at what he does.  He also has a little bit of a devilish look, which I can appreciate.  Or maybe my top was too low cut...hmmm.  The sheer time and care that each dish takes is simply amazing.  Dinner took about 2 hours.  We did the 8 course tasting menu and it was mouthwatering.  Every course built upon another...ending with fois gras.  I'm not a huge fan...but if I liked the texture of chewing on fat, I bet I would have gone bananas for it! :)  The wine list is out of control...it is what I refer to as the wine bible...the most prized bible EVER.  We settled with a  beautiful Pinot and it was excellent with all of the courses.    My favorite dish off  the tasting menu was the white fish carpaccio.  Actually the white fish was tied with the oyster with tomato water.  YUMMY!  Oh and the edamame soup with caviar was delish too!  I seriously dreamt about this place the night that I ate there.  I need to change my "last meal" because Sea Saw is some of the best food I have ever experienced.

OK...in the past I have verbally accosted this place. I used to diss the wine and that stupid overbearing wine list!  I have been to Kaz at least 10 times...and the last 5 times have been great! I used to hate the "Wine Bible" because it was too daunting...I now embrace this sweet deserving book each time I see it. I enjoyed a wonderful glass of Pinot, while Dr. Dave enjoyed a Sazerac. I had no clue what the hell a Sazerac was, however after a sip, I was on board for more!  Basically has obscure booze in it and ends up tasting like a nice scotch.  We shared a couple of nosh plates and enjoyed every single bite. We shared the Cowboy Ciao - Chopped Salad. We had it "traditional" with smoked salmon. However I think my favorite part of the salad was the dehydrated corn. I know that must seem odd...but it gives the salad a "chewy" texture...which is a wonderful compliment to the smokey salmon.   Our next dish was smoked sausages and pretzel bread. If you know me, I'm CRAZY for pretzel bread. This bread was amazing and even out shined the pretzel bread from City Hall. It was served so hot you can barely handle it along with a side with spicy mustard that is nearly too hot to stand...but makes it all the more fun to share. Ha!   The bartenders were really great and put up with our banter...so THANK YOU KAZ! I will be back soon!    I love finding the Truth behind that amazing wooden, unmarked door.

I'm going with 4 stars on this one because I'm torn. My first experience for dinner here a few years ago was terrible. I don't remember what I had and just remember the night being a bit of a blur...quite literally.  Did you know that you can do Vodka flights here?  My recommendation...enjoy the food vs. getting hammered.  Or at least eat your food first...then feel free to get wasted my friends.  But my next trip to this place was AMAZING. Good food, good wine, good company...what more can a girl ask for on a Saturday night?   So we show up on Saturday night with no rezzies. I was talked into "shooting from the hip" and alas how we ended up at a nice place with no reservations on a notorious date night...Saturday. To my pleasant surprise we are sat immediately in at a nice table near the window. After some quick (and quite witty I must say) banter between out waitress and my man-friend over the "Capon Breast", our drinks and Stetson salad were brought immediately.   Oh how I love this salad...so Yummy! For dinner I had the Mushroom Pan Fry and although rich, I did manage to nearly clean my plate...of course after dishing 4 - 5 fork fulls to man-friend. He had the special which was Halibut and it was also delish! I was too full for dessert so my 2nd glass of wine sufficed well.   My second visit here was amazing and I look forward to going back and trying more the menu. Maybe even some of the more exotic game?

I love this place! They have a couple of things going for them...they sell wine by the bottle to take home, they have a cheese/meat case where you can select your own snacks, and the staff is great.   In particular, they have an amazing bottle of Pinot. I would rank it as the best Pinot I have ever had...I can't recall the name, because after 2 bottles, I can rarely recall my man-friend's name. The only thing I know about it is that its sealed with wax...red wax. Sexy right? Just try it...you won't be disappointed.   The last two times that me and my man-friend Dave have been here, we have had some fun discussions with the bartender, who is always more than attentive to our needs. After picking out our favorite piece of brie and some meats, they take it all into the back and serve our treats with fresh olives/olive oil, and lots of bread. Yum! I've not had anything off the menu, and personally prefer to pick out my own cheeses/meats. So I would pass on the menu and hit the case instead.   Beware of the "Scottsdale" type crowd though...some people take themselves too seriously. We have seen some odd things happen at the bar here...anything from what we believe to be "swingers" to again (what we believe to be) female escorts. So mix that with some great cheese and even better wine...does life get more entertaining? I think not!

This restaurant is as good as it gets.  I have changed my last meal on earth to include anything from Atlas Bistro.  Now for my handy tips...this place is BYOB, so bringing your own booze means it's time to splurge on that nice bottle that you have tucked away for a rainy day!  Having a wine store attached to the restaurant is DANGEROUS...but darn convenient when you aren't quite sure what type of wine/champagne you want to commit to until "Game Time".  We started with a 1/2 bottle of champagne freshly purchased from AZ Wine next door.  Then followed with an amazing French Red.    The menu changes daily however there are a few wonderful dishes that stay on the menu, which include the sweetbreads, endive salad, and the delicious duck dish.  I went with a seasonal mushroom starter w/goat cheese (YUM!), procuitto & melon salad, duck, and yikes...I have forgotten what I had for dessert.  Damn French wine!  Needless to say, this was hands down, one of the best meals I've had in my life.  Manfriend says that EVERYTHING here is consistantly good, so I would try anything your palate desires.  Reservations are a MUST, since there are only 7 or 8 tables.  Atlas Bistro has many regulars that go in weekly, so many of their tables are already reserved each Friday or Saturday night.  This is a great place for a romantic date or a birthday or anniversary celebration.  The owners are AWESOME...it's rare that you ever get to meet the owners much less have them serve you and suggest dishes.  Atlas Bistro is a complete treat and I can't wait to go back!

Here is my recommendation, try anything here (it's ALL GOOD!).  However my favorite is brunch here.  You must try a Bloody Mary...they make them with NM Red Chile instead of Tabasco...it's delish.  Foodwise, I recommend the Enchiladas & Eggs...add green Chile, chicken and you have a feast suitable for the Gods.  This is definitely a splurge spot, but it's my favorite.  I have had probably over 50% of the menu and all is good.  This place is tiny...so it can be tough to grab a seat, but well worth the wait if you have your heart set on some Amazing NM food!  Plus, let's care it...with enough Bloody Mary's EVERYTHING tastes awesome!

Upon my 4th visit in which I enjoyed amazing snacks and strong drinks, I've decided to shout my love from the rooftops.   Oh AZ 88 how I love you! You have the best drinks (ok I've only tried one type of drink), wonderful food (ok, ok...I've only tried one sandwich) and excellent people watching (THIS I can attest to)...and the bathrooms are crazy. I personally like the Pink girls bathroom...oh and the Unisex one is cool too!   Apparently a lot of "architects" hang out here...at least I overheard 3 tool-bags say LOUDLY (of course just loud enough for the ladies nearby to overhear) that they were architects. Do women really fall for that? My intellect says the dumb ones do. Ironically enough, I was meeting a friend there who IS an architect...so he and I had some fun with that. The next few times that I went there was a great mix of people...so don't let the architect thing sway you.   Ok...here's the down low. I HAD to order a Grey Goose martini dirty with blue cheese olives...and it was DEE-LISH! Seriously, one of the better martinis I've had in town. And come to think of it, it's the only drink I've had the 4 times I've been there. Ha! I guess I'm a creature of habit.   Now to the food...you must try the AZ 88 Chicken Sandwich. It's a grilled chicken breast smothered in hot wing sauce, blue cheese dressing and sauteed celery (similar to pickles...but not as tangy). I struggle with trying anything new because this sandwich is so good. It is messy and drippy and amazing! I have also had a bit of the Au Poivre burger and that was really good too...but I love my little spicy, drippy sandwich!   Lastly, they have super cute bartenders. They pour strong drinks, give suggestions on the menu (even though I don't listen) and even shared with us the best nights to stop in. Thursdays are apparently not too busy from what I could tell. Oh yes, and they serve dinner late! They are open until 1:30am for drinks every night of the week and the kitchen is open until 12:30 every night. Ha! Check this place out...you will love it!

This place is super cute and have wonderful food.  There are a few things that stand out on this menu...one of them being the wonderful Pinot Nior's that they offer...and the 2nd, is the guacamole.  I know, I know...not the best pairing in the world, but when a girl needs a glass of vino, there are worse things in the world to pair with! ;) Great Carne Asada (my man's favorite) and I LOVE the Green Chile Posole.  Good amount of spice and isn't too hot, if you're not a spicy girl like me!  It's super cute inside and we love going during the week, there's rarely a wait!

I love this place!  The best soup/sand which combo you can find.  You must try their BLT Plus sandwich if you like that type of thing...all of their soups are amazing.  Even the vegetarian ones, which i get mainly...and normally I'm not into the vegetarian thing!  I have not tried the breakfast, but if one were closer to me, I would guarantee you, I would buy stock in the place and throw away my pots and pans!  Plus, they have wonderful sweet treats to put an end to a fabulous lunch!  Their bread for sale is wonderful and makes amazing sandwiches.

OK...I LOVE WINE.  And Yes, I would love some cheese with my wine...but NOT at this place.  YUCKY!  I love to try new places and thought that this place was going to be awesome.  The decor was adorable and set up like a parlor with several different rooms and an ADORABLE St. Bernard that hangs out in the "library". As we sit down eager for cheese and wine I revel in the menu so excited for what is to come.  The wine was wonderful but the cheese platter was HORRIBLE.  The cheeses were so strong that we were not able to eat any of them!  (We weren't lucky enough to get something normal like gouda or even machengo).  I then proceeded to order soup and my manfriend ordered an appetizer.  The soup came out with grease pooling at the top of the bowl...not appetizing to me.  And our appetizer (chicken of some sort) was fried and greasy as well.  We cut our losses at that point and snacked on leftovers at home.  For the price, there are LOTS of better wine bars, I would pass on this one...

If you are looking for an Optometrist in the area, look no more!  I had an appointment yesterday and am thrilled with my new glasses and contacts.  The staff is very knowledgeable and they are all awesome.  Tom fitted me for my new glasses and he was a total laugh riot!  Dr. Maynard was personable and even recommended a few restaurants in the area for me to try!  They have designer frames and the office was nice.  It's in a "strip mall" and looks kinda shabby from the outside, but is very cute and clean inside.

Seriously, this is some of the best pizza I've had in my LIFE.  The crust is puffy and chewy around the entire perimeter...it thins out right under the pizza allowing you to not fill up entirely on crust!   They also have the best hot wings in town...it's all in the sauce...and I'm crazy about it.  They serve these wings in a bowl and it generally comes with a decent amount of extra sauce at the bottom for a spicer wing.  We've requested our wings "swimming" before and boy were they!  Actually I have to be honest...that time "swimming" was a little too much sauce.   This is a special treat for me.  Give me a small pizza to share, an order of wings, and two 1/2 pitchers of beer (cause you can't order a full pitcher WTF?!?)...I'm set!   Seriously...my mouth waters every time I talk or in this case write about Barro's.    One thing to mention...this is NOT a nice place at all.  It's pretty dumpy, but fun on a Saturday or Sunday when you aren't looking for any glitz or glam.

So, I decided on Canal for happy hour this week. The location is great and the venue is very swanky yet comfortable inside. They play obscure videos/fashion runway shows on a giant projection screen in the main dining room. The music was a really good mix from Portishead to Amy Winehouse.  When we showed up it was pretty dead. At 5pm on a Wednesday night I was surprised that there were so little people there.   They make a damn good Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. I also tried a sip of the pear martini and that was also delicious! They have a whole menu of specialty drinks and although I didn't try any, I definitely was tempted...the Goose reigned on a Wednesday night though.   We tried several of the appetizers which I thought were pretty good. My favorite was the Grilled Cheese & Tomato Bisque. The sandwiches came in bite size portions in which you drizzled the Bisque on top...it was lovely. I also really enjoyed the Parmesan Fries. My date ordered the Sweet Corn Cakes which I wasn't a huge fan of. They were a little cold and bland...but I do like lots more flavor than I ever saw that little cake packing.   The service was great and the waiters were very attentive to our needs. Plates were cleared and drinks were filled immediately. It obviously had nothing to do with the fact that the place was dead...Ha!   This is a great date spot...follow my lead and grab a cozy couch on the patio...the view of the sun set was amazing.

After my 4th amazing visit to this spot, I have to write a review.  Every experience here has been wonderful.  The paito is even really nice, however I perfer sitting in the dining room where you can see the chefs at the robata grill.  Here are a couple of things you MUST try: Butterfish Tataki Any of the sushi...especially the Big Eye Tuna and the Tuna Belly Wagyu Beef  Prime Beef Filet **Hiratake Mushroom drizzled with truffle oil and truffle shavings.  This was seriously the best mushroom I have ever had in my life.  I think this was a special, but ask for it...you won't be dissapointed!**  The sake was delicious and they also had a great wine selection.  I chatted with a few men at the bar before we were sat and they boasted the tasting menu.  Once we were sat at an awesome table, we basically ordered enough that it could have been a tasting menu...but loved that we were not limited to certain options.  I would also recommend dessert.  We had the dessert platter and it was insane!  3 or 4 fresh sorbets, fresh fruit, and 3 (I think...dammit the wine!) different desserts.  It came on this cool boat packed with ice and flowers...very cool.  However we mainly picked since we were so full from everything else.    Each time I have been, even on Valentine's Day (with no reservations), the service was amazing and the wait staff is always very attentive.  PLUS, this place is right next to Terrior (check out my review if you aren't familiar).  So you can hit up Terrior before or after for some wine/cheese and swinger action. ;)  Does it get much better Scottsdale?  I think not...

Hanny's ended up saving my entire night! After realizing that a Road Runners hockey game was NOT a productive way to spend my Thursday night, we left mid game and wandered over to Hanny's.   Very chic. My new "bestie" Todd the bartender talked me into trying a lovely Cabernet that was reasonably priced at $8 a glass and was yummy! We also shared the bar plate which was fabulous. Prosciutto, crusty bread and ripe melon. Does life get any better? Pair that with a couple of glasses of wine and wonderful company...what a great Thursday night!   I didn't get to explore too much but I have heard that the bathrooms are amazing and you should check out the elevator shaft! Todd also mentioned something about the basement...unfortunately, I wasn't using my active listening skills.  So you will have to explore that one on your own. Freaky...

I've really tried to like this place.  Great location and they have plenty of mouthwatering items on the menu.    During my two visits it was extremely busy and even with a reservation, we still waited 30 minutes for a table - Issue 1. Issue 2 - this place has terrible staff. The bartenders and hostesses are rude and yes, I understand you are busy...but you can still smile and be nice!  I'm paying to be treated like crap?!? Bah...  After visiting the place twice for dinner I can say that the pretzel fondue is quite good.  I also liked the short rib dish as well as the crab stuffed chicken.  They are certainly onto something with the food, prices are so/so.  The wine options by the glass aren't very good and spendy for the quality that you get.  Besides, opting for a dirti 'tini makes the bar service a wee bit bearable.  I really, really wanted to like this place, but alas, it's another fantasitc idea that is executed sadly in poor downtown Phoenix.  Maybe some of the other options coming to CityScape this fall will fare better?  A girl can dream, can't she?

Terrible impression from the start. Staff are young kids that aren't concerned with happy customers. It's not a traditional restaurant set up, I'd liken it to a McDonalds experience. If you like standing in line and serving yourself a soft drink at the soda fountain then you will love it. I was expecting to be seated and have a waiter...this is NOT that kind of place. Food overall was ok at best. I had a salad and hubby had the Diablo burger and truffle fries. His burger had a good spice. The beef didn't have a good texture. Our fries were hard and not even hot. The kale salad was ok. With all the great burger places in the valley, I wouldn't repeat this mistake.
