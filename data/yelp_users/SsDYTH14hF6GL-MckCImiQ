Three of us stayed here for an event that was happening in Mesa. We appreciated the discounted rate for the weekend but it definitely was not the greatest hotel. The staff at the desk was friendly and check in was very fast. We booked a 2 queenbed room. When we walked in it was really hot and muggy. Smelled funky... But it was pretty clean and definitely a good size. You could easily fit 6 people in one room. I turned the air on cool right away and there was nothing coming out of the vent. We decided to get dinnerand give it some time to cool. We get back 2 hours later and it is even hotter. I called the front desk and the man answered, 'yes?' I said hello again wondering if he was talking to someone else? Answer again was 'yes?' not a 'hi how can I help you?' which would seem more customer friendly and professional but whatever. We asked if we could have the air looked at because it was very hot. He said he would send the maintenance man over. He climbed on a ladder and looked in the ceiling then mumbles about some hot water bottle being on said to give it a minute and left... We thought..ok it will cool down. Opened the windows and went to bed. I woke up drenched in sweat and hearing this loud noise. We discovered it was a cricket insie the room and luckily found it and killed the loud guy. We couldnt sleep from the heat and the noise and put up with it until morning.   Breakfast was free, which is nice since a lot of hotels don't offer that anymore but unfortunately the eggs were instant eggs... for free breakfast it was ok. After breakfast I decided to go to the front desk and ask about the heat in the room. The woman at the front was very nice and explained that in the winter time when the weather is nice in Phoenix the turn the cool air completely off and apologized. It would have been nice to have air conditioning for the room since it was so muggy feeling and even though the weather was cool outside, there was no breeze to bring in that cool weather. I know they must be trying to save a buck but... it would probably make people more comfortable despite the cool weather during the winter.  The next night we turned the air off which helped since it was blowing hot nasty air and were too tired to even care about the temperature. Checkout was easy.

Two words. GOOD MORNING! I lost complete track of time here and ended up walking out around 7am in the bright as sunlight feeling like I was on a walk of shame!! I had a blast and so did all of my girlfriends, the whole club is pretty big and dark and just ... so Vegas!  Don't let the weird and creepy casino that this place is in change your mind about going in. Good times lie inside!

This was a last minute decision for a birthday dinner and wow can I say it was amazing. I ordered the short ribs. Perfectly done! The alcohol selection was great and the service at the bar wonderful. It is definitely spendy...but worth the money if you feel like divulging yourself in an expensive meal. Service in general was great and the view from the restaurant was the icing on the cake!

Delicious!!! This place was definitely an authentic Italian restaurant. I ate here after a wedding for a reception, the service was absolutely spot on and amazing. Professional and friendly. Always were re filling wine and waters, and the food was delightful! The ceasar salad was perfect, the bread and pesto butter was yummy! We also had pasta and a chicken dish. We ended up being so stuffed no one could fit dessert.   Great place to go that is off the strip

YUM-O as Rachel Ray would say. How have all of these little places popped up in downtown Phoenix? Or...how have I not discovered them all until now?? I  LOVE this cafe. The service is fast, quick, and easy. The coffee...strong and sssmmoottthhh. This place is cozy and laid back. Radiohead was playing in the background. I had their veggie egg bake which was delicious though I wish they gave me more bread! It was so good. Brought home peanut butter cookies for my boyfriend and those were devoured right away. The atmosphere is great, decor is unique and has a slight hipster feel. They serve wine also which I found to be interesting. And the employees were friendly. Try this place out. I could really go for some of that coffee right about now. The baked goods in the window all looked decadent and they have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options.   (tried a bite of a vegan doughnut that my friend had.....did not like. I guess I like my butter and eggs deep fried in oil. It was just not the same.)

Decor? Very pleasing to the eye. Service was excellent. Food?? AMAZING. I had the pork tenderloin. I was prepared to see maybe 3 small medallions on  my plate because well that is usually what you get at a restaurant like that. Perfectly cooked, small portions. I was so surprised when my plate arrived. There were huge pieces of this tenderloin just cooked to perfection. Mouthwatering good. I was so very happy. I tried my boyfriend's dish, he ordered the relleno. It was ALSO so delicious. If I go back, I will be ordering that.  Needless to say, I left that place with a giant gourmet food baby.

Had a damn good time here dancing the night away. We got hooked up with a group of guys to join them while they were getting bottle service. Drinks all night. Large danced floor, fire even!  I had a blast and I think my friends did too

I stuffed myself silly twice at this buffet. Such a wide selection of tasty bites. Desserts everywhere. Prime rib, lamb, crab, eggs, sides, salads, etc. I will be back again!

Pretty decently located in Las Vegas. We would have walked more vs. taking cabs but the weather in the beginning of the month there was not fantastic. We took a cab to the middle of the strip for about $15. Not bad at all.  Service was exceptional, the rooms were nice. We just had a king studio sweet but we had a little kitchenette with a microwave, sink, and refrigerator.  One negative was the really weak shower and terrible shower head. Had hardly any flow and felt like it took ages to rinse out my hair. They may use soft water also which would have contributed to the not feeling rinsed off issue. Then the shower curtain liner was really short and definitely did not keep any of the water in the bathtub but that really was a small minute thing.  Their cafe and Starbucks downstairs was always busy of course and they were still quick.   It was quiet which was nice but if you want the true Vegas feel this isn't the place for you. WIFI was free, major plus. No hidden resort fees. Did have to pay for parking, $8 per day. Not horrible.

Yummy hidden gem in downtown Phoenix, though since Food Network has been there, the place has exploded. This is a tiny converted house and boy is it small. The inside is cute though and there are tables packed in along with a counter top bar.  The wait is long, and it is also worth it. The best days to go of course are the weekdays. Just avoid the weekend period. Local eggs, cheeses and milk. Local goods in general. The coffee was to die for! Home made jam! Thick cut delicious BACON! Do stop here.

How frustrating!!!! I wanted to love this place. The items on the menu sounded great. The atmosphere when we walked in was cozy, a definite upscale setting. We had a reservation for a large group, were seated right away no problem there. Immediately had waters for the table and some bread. Our server was great.   Unfortunately, the suggested meal I ordered was horrible! I was debating between the fillet Oscar style, and either a fish or seafood dish. After a suggestion by our waiter  I ended up ordering the Jumbo Gulf White Shrimp dish which is followed by the description "grilled with lemon, garlic, and fresh Jonah crab". By the way, this dish is $29.  I also ordered the crab and corn chowder. Damn the corn chowder was great. Rich, hot, and a good amount of crab. Sadly...my main dish was just awful. My first bite was dry and dry and more dry. I swear there was raw garlic and/or raw shallots on my plate and random crumbs of god knows what sprinkled over all of the shrimp. You would think that there would be a sauce on top of this dried grilled shrimp but there was not. How about a lemon butter sauce? No. I ate two shrimp off of my plate and quickly tried to give them away to everyone else but no one wanted them. This was one time I wish I had sent the plate back and ordered something different but that isn't usually how I roll. I regret that. Spending that much on a dinner for me usually means I liked my dish but this time I hated it. How I wish I sent it back.  The other end of the table had great looking dishes. They all ordered a steak dish. Ribeye, fillet, etc. All looked great and they all said it was delicious. Wish I was on that end.   Overpriced for what you get.   I won't be back,

Happy hour drink prices = AMAZING  Dinner was delicious. Had the baked goat cheese. This was SO good. How can you go wrong with goat cheese though....  Also ate the pork chile verde which was very good and truly the cornbread was some of the best I have had at a restaurant. Usually it is too dry or dense...this bread was light, fluffy, perfectly sweet/salty. My friend had the cauliflower soup and salad. Extremely tasty and satisfying and despite being so full from dinner, we had the cheesecake in a jar to top things off.   Atmosphere is definitely hipster and the building is just tucked away in the most random area in downtown Phoenix. Loved the decor and loved the openness of it all. I didn't necessarily like how loud it was inside. I don't think they can help that though.   Try it out!

Gorgeous hotel and casino. I like how it feels new, and yet it doesn't feel "stuffy" I can still walk around in sweat pants and feel ok! It definitely has an Asian flair to it. There are a bunch of Asian restaurants and the entire design is just sleek and chic.  One downside was probably user error on my part. The high tech rooms with crazy alarm clocks and remote controlled everything was a little frustrating! I accidentally hit the "good night" button and every light turns off, the TV turns off, and the shades automatically close.   The pool was nice and relaxing. We did not go to the "hip" pool. We needed some quiet time if you know what I mean.   Overall, I will stay here at this hotel again.   Valet service was speedy!

I have had quite a bit of Indian food in my life and this has been by far the best. Four of us stuffed ourselves into a food coma. The ingredients were all fresh, the lunch specials such a great deal. The flavors were out of this world. I want to go back soon, I am getting hungry thinking about it.   Great service also by the way. They were attentive, friendly, and quick.

Go here for happy hour.  fundido with veggies an elote 2 fish tacos 1 carne asada taco 1 cochinita taco 1 veggie taco tres leches cake 6 drinks (pear mojitos and margaritas)  $61.00  I think that is a pretty good price for two people who left completely stuffed. Not to mention, all of the flavors in these dishes were spot on!!! The cochinita taco was my absolutely favorite taco. If I could go back I would definitely get the fundido again with veggies, an elote, and more cochinita tacos no questions asked. If I had room...let me rephrase...I would make room for the tres leches cake.  Atmosphere was trendy and modern  I did read that a lot of people had trouble with service. I was just there last week and we had great service. We were attended to right away, had water and drink refills without asking, and our server was really personable and on the ball. I have not one complaint about service.

Yummy restaurant in the middle of the very expensive and very prestigious shopping mall. Random spot for such a tasty place, but it was worth it.   My friend and I shared the Caesar salad and then we each had the same pasta dish and for the life of me I cannot remember what it was called but I was happy.  Perfect last meal in Vegas

Ate here for a late late dinner after an exhausting 60 hours of Vegas. The food was delicious! We ordered off of their carvery portion of their menu. Prime rib and brisket. Both a WOW. I will definitely be going back.   The atmosphere was really laid back..then again we did eat there around 10pm.   Can't comment on any of the beer though it looked like they had a large selection. Next time

Do not consider this a dance club. This is most definitely a lounge. Bottle service was nice. The whole atmosphere is very chill. If you are looking for that, then definitely go here, but the yelp category of dance club...no.   I felt like if I was a man with a cigar I would have fit right on in!

CRAZIEST POOL PARTY! We showed up around 11 and had a hook up to get in. We did not wait in line and when we arrive there were already a ton of people inside the pool. It was hot, and there was no where to store your stuff, but we just shoved everything into a bush. The DJ booth was amazing, and the water felt amazing compared to the hot hot summer sun.   We fell into some people's amazing generosity and were invited up to the top tier VIP cabanas with bottle service and a really great cabana girl. She was pouring shots for everyone and all liquor, mixers, and waters were restocked all of the time. They had this huge bed where you can lay and look over the entire pool from the balcony for some serious people watching, though being in the pool was a better people watching experience.  By the end of the day the pool was PACKED. SOOOO many people. Thank goodness for the generosity of others because if I had to stay in the pool without anywhere to go... I would have left.  Overall this experience: Fun. Fun. Fun.

TASTY! We randomly decided to go here for late lunch the beginning of the month on a little Vegas getaway with my honey.   Made it to Planet Hollywood to find a pretty long line.... We decided to wait it out, and we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes or so which was not terrible. I had the Euro Burger had a number of different flavors which went very well together. My other half had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. I had a bite it was ok.. I was expecting more spice and more intense flavors but it was tasty. The burger patty was seasoned well and of course cooked perfectly to our taste of medium, but In all honesty (i am a true carb lover) the best part of the burger was the bun. We also ordered onion rings and parmesan and truffle french fries. The onion rings were delicious, definitely freshly fried. On top of food we added one drink each and after all of that let me tell you we were very full. We expected a huge bill but it was right around $70 which was not terrible at all considering we had drinks and were leaving absolutely stuffed.   Service was great!

LOVE the new location. It is always delicious, but the new building is much more spacious and can move a lot more customers. It still has the same vibe as the old place, just bigger!

Great service! Tasty little random find. Ate here because we were staying at the Hyatt House. Their sushi was delicious and had hilarious names. Great staff. And tasty drinks. Had the Drunk Monk. Perfectly balanced drink. We all had almost every single roll. All were devoured. Sweet chili edamame so addictive. Pork belly skewers ok. Could have been more melt in your mouth but they were good.
