Able to schedule an apt, pretty quickly--less than 3 days away to have some moles checked out. Will let you know, how the visit goes- demeanor, promptness, cleanliness, etc. But, so far so good. 9-22-09--went to the office, everything was spot on- demeanor, promptness, cleanliness, etc... He said that my moles were fine, but keep an eye for them; and that dermatologist are looking for the "level of sun exposure" that an individual can absorb (for example a fair blue eyed blonde cannot absorb as much as someone with my background- Filipino). Suggested, I use Blue Lizard sunscreen and creates his own comic books. Totally recommend him. Will use him again, no problem.

Okay, I call Verizon 800# to check out WHERE the closest store was when I was out and about. I was directed to this store. So here, I go. Guys are wearing Verizon Shirts, so I think, I am in a Verizon store... NOT! IT's a retailer...BUT that is not the kicker. I walk in, they don't have a ph that I need, but will go pick one up. Nice Customer Service, I think... Well, I pay for my ph; they hook up the ph #, and I walk out. No problem...right? WRONG! I go home and start using my ph..go into the pictures and WTH?!!! There is a pix of a fat woman on my NEW phone that I paid FULL price for... So I figure, it's a refurbished phone GO WIRELESS SOLD TO ME AS BRAND NEW-- Nice work guys. BUT wait, it gets worse! I then take the ph back to an actual Verizon store an THEY tell me, that I have to take it back to the store-Go Wireless, that I bought it from. I drive all the way back out and THEN, return everything, cancel my contract, my ph #, etc... -it's been less than 3 days; and want a credit. Not to mention the time I wasted...Thinking I had it all figured out, it's canceled, right? I go to A REAL Verizon store and asked get a new ph- only to find out Go Wireless NEVER canceled my old number/contract. WTF?!! Geezus, and am told I need to call the Go Wireless Store to have them cancel it... I call the Store again..and they give me the 800 # for Verizon. Lucky, I called because Verizon was going to charge me the $350 for early term fee-- THAT Go Wireless never took care of in the first place.... Geezus guys!  Is this brain surgery because everyone acts like it is. It's a one banana job. My suggestion is--NEVER EVER USE THEM. Now, it will be interesting to see if I ever get a refund from these clowns...

Hey, it's typical Mexican fare, so don't expect gourmet. Atmosphere is family-friendly, gives you nachos to munch on; spicy bean dip--YUM! and salsa--while you are waiting for your food. They pretty much leave you alone to eat, which I am thankful for...One standout is that Raul our server was on time when we wanted anything and had it right to us. Chicken tostado soup to die for. The strawberry margarita was actually pretty good. All in all- a good place to have close by. -- I like it. I'll be baaahhhck. - :)

I went into get a copy of my test and was informed that it would take 7-10 days to get a copy of a test that I DID 7 months ago? Huh? Everthing was fine according to them/result and I offered to wait, until Dr. Mikel was free to review my notes and release them. I was then, told that he might not even get to my chart today.... Geez . Needless to say, I won't be back. But if you have plenty of time to waste, definitely go there.

DON'T get a Cabana at the pool here. Not worth the $300 (doesn't include bottle service) and any drinks you buy is extra. Which I was okay with actually. However,  the door guy is a complete Nazi!  My friend had to get a room to get into the pool area (another 100 bucks) Older people, a few ladies for hire, "interesting" crowd to say the least. I'll take my future  business to El Santo or Maia.

My secretary used them (Jay) and said nothing but good things.  My initial conversation with them, went well and seemed to be pretty straight up, which I can't say for all lawyers, that I have spoken to.

I am not a big fan of thin crusted pizza, but it was very good and the full bar helps.

I first found out about the Korean Bath Houses through a magazine article and about the Korean scrub they will do there. I forget what it's called. A nice older Korean woman will literally scrub/scrape off the first layer of dead skin; which sounds gross, but afterwards, your skin is as soft and pink; as a baby's bottom--but everywhere! (Don't read into that). OMGosh! Sign me up!!  This place did not disappoint. But it's not a "spa" in the American way of thinking. It's a bathouse--very different. So research before you go--- After my scrubbing, she massaged my skin with oil, and a cool yogurt cream, and finally washed my hair. Good gosh. Best 3 hours, I've spent in a while. Check out the co-ed areas...where you can rest and take a nap if you feel like it. Best part---It is very very clean!! Cost about $100 bucks and then $20 for tip. I'll def be back.

In a nutshell, CARMAX did everything they said they would. When I told them, I needed the vehicle sooner, than a week. they said, it would arrive in two days and it did?!! Wow... a car dealership that does what it says it will? .... Then when test driven the transmission was skipping, they said they would have BMW check it out and get back to me in two days and again, CARMAX did get back to me in two days and replaced the sensor. l was comparing two vehicles (one new) MINI Scottsdale and a used one from Carmax. I ended up buying from Carmax cause they did everything they said, they would and super nice on top of it. No "car salesman" type here. Highly reccommend!

Fitness Factory---Gym that is not friendly to special needs kiddos  I know, that we all have enough to do and stress in our lives, as it is, BUT, on top of everything we do. For our kiddo's not be respected by a local company just makes me plain mad and if you choose to join this gym and give them your money, I completely respect your decision. However, I just wanted to let you know that Fitness Factory has made it very clear to me; that special needs kiddos are not really "welcome" to their kids club, since they and I quote "don't have many of "those" kids enter/leave their gym."  All the other gyms (24 hour fitness and I have to especially note that Mountside Fitness- has been OUTSTANDING!) have made an effort, to reasonably accommodate me, BUT, not Fitness Factory.    With the new year starting, I know that is the season of gym memberships is going up. However, I just wanted you to be aware of which gyms really support and help EVERYONE in the community along.   Take care!! And good health.

First, you have to think- where you are. Apache Junction, Gold Canyon, etc. However, for a cafe- basic American food. I gotta say, this place ROCKs it up. In other words, YUMMY! I've eaten here several times and the food is always tasty. Had the cod, had the hamburger, had the breakfast. Always full of flavor and not too greasy. Keep up the good work! Sundays mornings for breakfast are super busy- esp when the blue hairs come back from whatever hell=ish cold climate they live in the rest of the year. Cafe is open at night too, now till 8 or 9pm, so I can work late and get my grub on. YAY!

Just called and left vm. Stay tuned. :) They were great!! Returned my call and was able to get someone out to my house within the day! Kind of important since 1/2 my condo was without electricity--no tv, no dvd, no modem...no lights. Now, I know what the cave men felt like. They diagnosed the problem and fixed it pronto. $200 for service call, but WORTH EVERY penny! Keep up the great work guys. THANKS!

I went to E&C based on the yelp reviews and I was not dissapointed.  They deserve all 5 stars and then some. I had some concerns around child support (ex is acting weird, but that is why they are ex's-correct? ) The office scheduled me a timely manner (immediate) and was flexi when I couldn't make the 1st meeting. Craig was sympathetic, uber professional and def a subject matter expert. He took his time to explain to me, what is what, and even gave me several strategic scenarios of how we could do the needful. All in all, I highly recommend and will def use in the future.

12-14-2012--I'm paranoid about my hair. More than paranoid--freakish to the point that I used to fly to Portland to get the color/cut just PERFECT. As in Super-Model perfect, when I walked out the door. My gf, gets her color done here...so as far as ease of scheduling, I was seen within 1 week. Very cool. 4 stars so far. We shall see how the end result looks. I am hopefully optimistic. Stay tuned.  1-15-2013--Jennifer and THIS PLACE ROCKS!!  Ah-mazing is all I can say. My color/ cut turned out PERFECTLY. Exactly what I wanted and I will NEVER go any other place in Scottsdale...  When you get your hair shampooed ,  you go into a quiet room, with heated neck rests and spa music. You can totally chill. I hate to say how great she is...because I am afraid that she'll be booked up...but can't let this secret remain one. I looked to long and hard for a damn good hair stylist,  after reading many yelp reviews and was sorely disappointed...so now, that, I finally found one, I shall share  the good news with you. Hope this helps!  2015- My hair still gets compliments from random strangers due to Jennifer Andre salon! Amazing work!!

Drivers are charging for time waiting in Phoenix. Supposed to be .09 cents per minute for uber XL. However, I am have found that drivers are charging me $1 to $2.50 PER Fare to drive up their take home $$$. At .09 a minute that means I made them wait 6 min at a minimum!! I know this isn't true, cause I was standing there looking at both drivers last night. 2-3 min max!!! To say goodbye to my friends.... I will be using Chariot & Lyft-- and will download those apps to my friends phones, just like I did uber. One more thing- their GPS always takes the driver to WRONG place & so even though, I am sitting here at my Front door.. Waiting... I GET charged that wait time!
