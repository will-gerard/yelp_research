Always good.  Staff is great.  Very fast when you are just having a quick lunch.  Staff goes out of there way to make sure you are comfortable.   Great for business meetings to overly loud for a bar

Good service.  The burgers where good.   The fries on the other hand did not seem that good this time.  They seemed like they were sitting around for a long time. Other than that everything was good.

Do not trust them Been fighting over a deposit from the tool area for a week now.  They have no problem taking your money but if they make a mistake it takes weeks to try to get it back.  Customer care is just as bad.  Nobody wants to do anything.  Save your money and time and go somewhere else. Don't be a victim like me.  I will never go there again.

First time there.  I can not wait to go back.  My boss took us for cocktails.  I was really suprised on how good the food was there.  You can tell it was all fresh.  The staff where very nice and had knowledge about everything on the menu.  The price was very good for scottsdale.  Even there appetizers where well price with large portions.  Can not wait to go again.

First time there   WAS GREAT.  The waiter was great. It was great food.  I can not wait until I go back.  Must say food was a little slow coming out but, I was not in a hurry.  Still can not stop thinking about the food.  It was so good. Great family environment.   Great job guys.

I have been coming here since I was little.  Some people do not like the mom and pop restaurant because they are not that modern.  I think these are places are great. This is a great place to go.  They have a lot of good old fashioned comfort food.  This place is very simple so if you are looking for a grand place this is not it.  But good food and good people are always here. Very family freindly.
