I was a little hesitant to come to this place, but so glad I did. They were very professional and easy going. It almost felt like I was catching up with an old friend. I have short stubby thumbs, know as club thumbs, and it's hard for nail technicians to work with my thumbs, but QT really took his time and formed a nail tip with acrylic. Thank you QT, you have yourself a loyal customer
