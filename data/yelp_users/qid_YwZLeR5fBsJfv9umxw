the only reason I decided to eat at this place was because they delivered. I unfortunately ordered the green chili burito. It hands down had to be the worst burito I have ever tasted.  I called and they sent me back another burito. At first I was happy then I took a bite and it was the same soup filled burito I had received the first time. The only difference was they toasted the tortilla so it was firmer. The delivery driver was rude and expected a tip when he didn't even bring forks or napkins. I will never go to this establishment again. If your looking for better fast burito service go to new Mexican grill. Worst $9.00 I have ever spent. I guess it good if you like a good deal, because I got two awful burito for the price of one......terrible
