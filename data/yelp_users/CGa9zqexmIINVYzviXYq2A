I've reviewed this spa before but it never hurts to support a good business! I love it when I'm lucky enough to get Wendy! She's delightful!

The absolute worst management. The people are not happy, no one acts like they care if you shop there or not. They carry only the most basic items, as though it were a poorly run 7-11. I tell myself every time I go, that it will be my last trip... And then I forget since its so close to my home. But today they had there last chance at my money. I am done with them and Safeway. No stars. But I had to choose at least one

The worst customer service around. Employees stand around glassy eyed while patrons struggle to locate product or check out. Their stock is not dependable. I've said before I would not take my money and spend it there again - I mean it this time. I'm done. I am only giving one star because that's the least I'm allowed

If you are seeking a top notch facial - look no further than Cindy Sierzchula with Salon Esprit - she is professional, her service is luxurious, the neck and head massage unmatched - I loved her!!!!

I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)
