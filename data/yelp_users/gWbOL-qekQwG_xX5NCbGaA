One of the gems of Ahwatukee! Hidden discreetly in an old strip mall, MWC hits you with an unexpected, fresh dose of casual classiness as soon as you enter. Comfy couches, nice lighting, great little patio overlooking a golf course, suuuper friendly and attentive staff, and a pretty good happy hour make this place awesome in my book. Wine selection exceeds my palate, and they even have an eclectic offering of microbrews for beer drinkers like myself.  Haven't tried the fare, so no opinion on the food. Highly recommended if you find yourself on a date...great place to enjoy conversation and a glass of fermented grapes.

Delux is brilliant in its simplicity: great gourmet burgers and lots of beer in a posh/trendy atmosphere.  The fish sandwich is worthy of 5-stars, and the selection of craft beer on tap is quite impressive.  Great spot for a date, the bathrooms are pretty sweet too.

Trader Joe's is legit in every since of the word. Go here, get some stuff, be happy.    *TIP: my go-to place for flowers on mother's day or when I screw up with the lady friend...nice selection and inexpensive!

I've been coming here since I was a wee lad of about 10, and it's still one of my favorite places in town. The quality of the chips have gone down since they moved to a new building, but the burritos are still awesome. The only other bummer: don't have the free burrito punch cards anymore :(

This business is definitely in the business of ripping people off. My girlfriend took her car there to have the clutch checked out and they ended up removing her transmission without her approval, charging her hundreds for the labor, didn't fix anything, and held her car hostage until she paid them.  While AAMCO said it would cost close to $3000 to fix her transmission, she later found out from a reputable mechanic that her problem was just a bad cable that ended up costing about $100. Boo to you AAMCO for taking advantage of people. I say BOO to you!
