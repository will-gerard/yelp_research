This is my neighborhood stop and as close to what you get for a "china town" here in PHX.  The Ranch Market is my grocery store and the Golden Buddha is the watering hole I am closest to and its been fun to be exposed to something "different" in the neighborhood. Yeah it's a strip mall with a coy pond and garden to those in other more metropolitan back ground or source, but it's what we got! ( I knocked off that last star for a reality check).  Within the center their are doctors offices, apartments and travel agencies that specialize in travel to Asia. Our stops signs are in Chinese too to paint a picture. All nationalities get their fresh fish at the market and you have to try the bakery for arguably the best chau siu bao hands down.  A definite place to go for lunch if you are here. Walking through the gardens is the best attraction to walk off the dum sum. Its ponds and series of bridges and temple type architecture will make you feel less like you are under the flight path of PHX and more like you are on a different latitude and longitude if even for a second...   Adjacent to the airport it represents a grain of cultural sand in a desert of fast food restaurants and Circle K's that is most of phoenix. Short walking distance from the 44th ST Light rail station where one could possible stumble to while on a light rail jaunt Tempe / PHX bound.  Also next to main airport destination and hotels including a "W" and parking to the airport.  It's a pretty industrialized neighborhood outside but it contains some of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley as well Chinese medicine shop and other various shops hardly found anywhere else in AZ.

ARRRGGHHHHHHH@#!@!! I have to say in life I try not to hate things. I think everyone will understand when I say I hate flying this airline.  Mixed messages, rude staff, broken seats are all par for the course. I will avoid saving that few bucks on Price line and pay hard coin to be treated line a paying customer instead something that the overworked humanoids behind the desk have to process and deal with during our sometimes long uncomfortable time together.  Ughh I need to take a shower after writing this I feel gross.

I love this place! You can't beat the all you can eat sushi for a 20 spot. No seriously. A favorite for the price and service. I am a bit of a regular so I will just start by saying I have a TON of bias...There I said it. I can't really speak to the Korean food aspect of it but I have a friend who has a bit of an addiction to the Kim-chi. . The waitresses are very engaging and I have never had even close to a bad experience here.  I always sit at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs are always very entertaining, prompt, and worth mentioning. A good sushi chef brings a sense of atmosphere to any sushi place I place a little gold star next to these guys

Wait how did I get into this place? The non descriptive sign on the uhh front of the building ( or is it the back) is cryptic to say the least.. and no I hadn't even had a glass of the vino yet and I circled around it twice.  Anyway once I had found this place I was impressed by it cavernous old world feel. Cheese plates and red wine are a great way to start or end a night. One of Scottsdale's  gems in old town a must when out on the town.   Your date will appreciate your sensibility and culture in the dimly lit ambiance and may overlook the fact that you spilled fondue on your shirt and don't know the difference between a Malbec and Pinot Grigio, trust me.

Yuck...  Alright I don't complain about much...No really!! Check my posts... it could be construed I am overly positive... That's why this place needed to be reviewed, because I can't be positive about this place. Not even a little... Here is why:  So I get into a little fender-bender and I drop my car off to get it fixed by the insurance company. I pick literally the closest place to the shop because well all car rental places are the same eh?   Not so my friend... I have never seen a more ghetto, backroom operation in my whole life.  So the place is in this non-descript dirty little building in an industrial area in Tempe. That is nothing to bitch about but the dingy little office INSIDE...frankly made me want to take a shower.  There is one person doing everything and it took over an hour to be out the door with the car.   The car I got was not washed. It smelled like someone smoked in it for weeks with the windows rolled up and left burning cigarettes burning in it while they were sleeping at night.   They knew it was through insurance , so I am not sure why they gave me a car that was more than ANY insurance would actually pay leaving me with a bill of over 200 bucks after the insurance.   There was a snag with my insurance initially which has nothing to do with them... but I did get a call from them after I turned in the car, asking me to pay again ( after I paid out of pocket) ... apparently there is no office memos or communication in that office.  Yeah that's it...but for as something as simple a renting a car they sure managed to make it a spectacular screw-up, and probably the worst experience I have ever really had renting a car. I would certainly look to other places if you are forced to rent in that neighborhood.

As liquor stores go this place is aces...   If you can't find your poison here then you need to drink something else.  The guys here are super friendly and are very helpful if you want to try something new. Pick up yer papers, porn and your hooch just like any other circle k...but! Your regular quickie mart does not have the MASSIVE selection this place does. The wine racks are the best in a mile radius and the beer selection is fairly extensive (lotsa exotic stuff to try). Prices are reasonable ...Certainly the best and one of the closest to campus. I think the coolers could be colder but hey maybe it's just me?  Located nearest to the light rail it's probably your best bet for a public transportation detour.   Open late you should certainly check it out the next time you need to refuel.

ahhh  Casey Moore's   Words barely can encapsulate the time spent in and my feelings I have for this Irish bar. If you are from Tempe and have tattoos you perhaps can identify with the culture of Casey Moore's.  Weekend patio excursions are a treat in the Maple-Ash district just spitting distance to Mill Avenue. There is never really a bad time to come to this bar and I have certainly been there enough to know. Casey Moore's oysters and cheap and good. As frequently as I eat oysters I would fully endorse this bars shellfish  The clam chowder is king for a snack. You can get escargot here that is decent and there is not much on the menu that I would not recommend.  Lunch is the perfect weekend after noon in the summer with misters and giant fans  There have been times where I looked for houses with the sole purpose of being "In the neighborhood" More of a lifestyle choice than a restaurant..  We have laughed,.. we have cried,.. we have sometimes gotten kicked out of it. We have always come back. Casey Moore's is certainly a place that needs to be visited while in Tempe.

Yo I don't know about these guys computer skills but all the staff were super knowledgeable geek to geek.. but I went to a Ubuntu release party there..and it was off the hook!  First it was an open bar ..so my many thanks to these great guys for getting me liquored up for free.  Second they were giving away warez of the newest Ubuntu release ..and well that's pretty darn cool.  Third Free prize drawing where the gave away mini net books , computers and of course the usual shwag you may expect.  All and all a great experience.. I uploaded photos of the night. A great time to be had for all you nerds who like to talk about computers/ unix n stuff while gettin yer drink on for free.  They have these things occasionally ..and yes I found out about this event through Yelp.. So check it out next time if you are into all that! I am sure they would love to meet you ...and if you have a computer problem get you back surfing! ..(or whatever you do on a computer when not wasting time on it :)

There is only one reason  why I shouldn't love this pizza.  Waiting an OBSCENE amount of time for a pizza is a pretty big one. If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think.  I would tell you about it ( HERE)...   but you know what its that good. I have had pizza around the world ,its not the best..... but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code. I would love to say don't believe  "the hype" but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4+ hours for a pizza on a Saturday night.   Lets really face the reality of that night though. You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anyway.Its certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either.. Armed with that information you know what to expect. While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central.This is worth it just to know what people are talking about.  This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients. The thin cust is perfect.  The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant. We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us, so I am not sure if that behavior / treatment is normal.   Not a place to pop in and grab a bite to eat with a small group but if you are REALLY not in rush then this place is one of the best in AZ.

Chino bandidos is probably not one of the best restaurants in the valley.....But it is one of the top 3 most delightfully INTERESTING dining combinations I have experienced anywhere on the planet so far.   Mexican & Chinese with a twist of Jamaican is a crazy combo of taste variations to find in the desert. This uniquely American melting pot concept seems to pull it off really against all odds in my mind ....  I can still remember my bewilderment the first time I was exposed to this mexi-nees-ican (?) menu and absolutely friggin LOVE to bring people here to watch their reaction.  Also the 7,500 pound mascot in the dining room has to be mentioned at least once... and maybe photographed several times just be cheesy.    Although I have had EVERYTHING on the menu at least once. My favorite is the Jerk Chicken. Served on a bed of rice and enjoyed with a Red Stripe, it's what I came all the way to the Sunny Slope area for.  Any time I possibly could. That, and the snikerdoodle that was carefully stowed away in the trunk safely for a midnight session.  These days they have 2 locations and the new one is just as far away as the original. I will faithfully drive where ever they are in the valley maybe once a year. The staff will let you try what ever you want.  And I have never taken anyone who didn't like it. Just know that you can combine EVERYTHING so maybe get creative ...on your second or third time...   Don't be demure on asking what other ppl/staff like...Everything's good in my opinion... Neighborhood atmosphere ...Some of it's greasy as all hell but great food none the less.

The Compass room is a favorite of mine for a number of reasons.  Its central location is perfect for a night at the opera or finishing a night out.  Its menu has a fairly sophisticated selection and for the price it's a pretty good deal for a swanky hotel bar place in down town PHX. They have a fairly decent brunch on Sunday morning with generous helping of the mimosas (and they aint shy about pouring) Not an everyday place for sure but a place to take the folks while they visit from out of town and have them wow'ed at the pretty lights as they stand elevated looking at the valley, or to take that special date where you want a memorable quiet night to get to know each other. The service is what you would expect from a place of this caliber and the wine selection is not out of this world...but hey you must remember you are really on top of the Hyatt :P  All and all worth while experience.

Finally we get a light rail!!   I live about a block away from a station. I take it on the weekends sometimes to go out and not have to worry about driving.  It opens up Mill avenue and downtown Phoenix for me and a lot more places to yelp about :)  I wish they would get a line from Scottsdale to Chandler..but baby steps.. I am just glad there is now a start to a real mass transit system here in the valley.  The biggest improvement is they run the trains till 2:30-3ish on the weekends for people to stumble home ..JUST LIKE ME!  My work also covers a transportation pass so its free too! ..

Usually a stop early in the night on Mill Avenue in Tempe  Love the street tacos .. Service is spot on most times depends how busy it is ..  Go before 10 pm on weekends = calm bar ,sports or music videos. playing..After then they take the tables away inside and it is booty shakin with horny college kids with flipped up collars trying to score.  Frequent vendor giva-ways with stuff you may not have tried before..

Alright... I have lived here for almost a year.  Let me quietly reflect on my time here with some insight to anyone who want to live here: The place is brand new and lets face it, the term luxury apartment certainly applies here. My back yard is Tempe Town Lake. There is a roof top lounge, and NIIICE gym that is here for you to use. Your cable, internet and water are included in the hefty price you pay for this luxury.   They make it pretty convenient. Less than a mile and a $7.00 cab ride from Mill Ave, South Scottsdale, Tempe market place, the Light rail is a little closer than that.  Spitting distance to the stadium here in Tempe. Location, location, location ...right?   If you are a 20 something year old ASU rich kid who drives a $60,000 sports car perhaps.   I however am a 30 something professional who is frankly sick of hearing that state of the art sound system that bumps the obnoxious gangsta rap of silver spoon rebellion at 3:30Am on a Tuesday.   I am Also sick of the fire alarm at 5 am goes off both when the same rich kid is drunk and decides this place is just an extension of the dorm room he never had, or when the "state of the art fire system malfunctions" next to your head ( 5 times so far) for no reason and without explanation from the management. I also am not thrilled with the girl who has "Daddy's Little Girl" on her license plate clips my car because she's texting on her Paris Hilton sidekick ( no it's not just one)....and  I swear that soon they will make an O.C. type show out of this place.  I digress and stop the hate.  Unless you are affluent enough (or don't pay the rent yourself) to pay DOUBLE what you should for an apartment with a stunning view and not blink about it. I would find some where else to live.   The facilities are all shiny on the outside and the sales reps will make this place out to be nirvana in the 480...But when it really boils down to it...  The marble top kitchen counters and contemporary living will never help you reach a path to enlightenment...happiness... or a good night sleep.   I have all and all enjoyed living here but I will not be renewing my lease and I am sure going to tell any one that asks about it the perils of living at this gold plated oasis on the Salt River.

This place is the best lunch spot I have been to in a long time. The asparagus sandwich is legendary and the bread is always fresh and tasty. Only been there a few times but everything I have had was worth commenting about ( even the P.B. & J).  Just moved to a new location that is a bit out of the way but worth the journey  One of the finds close to the Arcadia area that is a good Friday work lunch and a place to introduce your friends to. Lots more to try and place worth doing a second review about.

This is what Yelp is for, as I can now fully express my absolute passion for this place.  Now I have been around the block a few times when it comes to sushi and this place is my one of my favorites. The octopus is fresh and cold, the sake is nice and hot and the trance music is sometimes LOUD and somewhat obnoxious. When I think of my fish place, I like to have all three. Events like naked sushi have been known to happen there and in my book that gives a place a character. I might just have to tell someone about it. So here goes:   Now I have to start somewhere so I will start by giving mad props to the sushi chefs. After all that is what you go there for right? (Maybe naked sushi) These guys get fresh fish in the desert and they make it look GOOD( and keep it smelling good too). The squid looks like it was pulled out of the ocean mint accent and decoration included. The detail of the appearance is a big deal to me when I think raw fish. Now we shan't forget we are in Mesa but this is darn good.  Mostly I sit at the sushi bar and the guys have always been top shelf. They occasionally give you stuff to try, and if they see you on a date they made slide you some fruit with whipped cream on it. I feel like I am really taken care of every time I go there. I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience.  Their drink menu is pretty sweet too if you are into mixed booze. Try the signature drink a "Sakitini" :0  I have been here plenty and the service is always swift, sweet and sorta shy. This place is my friend and I's solace at 1am in a Tuesday night for a late night sushi run. For me,  as good as it gets so close to my house and a little better:)

Chandler Arizona is not usually associated with sushi but in my mind it is now! I hold this place somewhat above its strip mall location in the suburbs  It is not often I am taken by a sushi place like this because this one is a little tucked away, all quiet and un-assuming ...  and BAM! great fish .. Just like that out of nowhere..Cheap! Its like a ninja or something?  We got there right before they were closing ( we called and asked them if it was o.k. first) ..things were already being wrapped up. they unwrapped everything and served us with all the patience of a good restaurant.  Octopus fresh , ika decent , squid salad delicious.. Japanese hip hop playing for music .. Japanese crazy game shows on TV..  My New favorite rotating sushi boat type plate place here.. And there were three of us and we got out of there super cheap with beer for less than 12 bucks a piece! Stuffed to the brim too!  I am a total fan of this place .. it did it for me. Check it out its got mad fish skills :P

There are two places in the valley that you should definitely write home to mom about when it comes to wood fire oven pizza.   This is the other one.  This is the one however that you can get into pretty much whenever you want.  This is the one that you know has better pizza than 99.9% of the rest of them.   I would come here if I didn't have all night to get some really first class pizza. I would bring someone here to give them the experience anytime.  Located in what most would consider the fringe of the ghetto... It certainly is a bit out of the way. This small pizza place has limited parking and seating for maybe 20 people max in the entire place. What it lacks in space in certainly makes up for in taste. It's BYOB too if you are into that type of thing... (There is a liquor store with a bad selection next to it... but I certainly would recommend stopping somewhere else).  You need to stop in and have one of there BIG pizzas, for me it set a new standard somewhere in my brain. All the quality of something authentically Italian sans all the hype. Prices are reasonable. Owner/staff world class... Tiny... but I have gotten have there a tad early no problem just sitting down...   Their crust seems a bit mushy I will admit so a fork maybe in order. All and all one of the best places for Italian and pizza hands down.

Ha! This place is funny.. I am only reviewing the Bar at night ..  Having been  here a total of three times now so I think I can fairly evaluate this place with a good average of experiences to formulate  an articulate and befitting summary of my opinion of this establishment:  If you want to get yer drink on and yer swerve on with an assortment of homies and rather drunk frat guys this is yer stop cuzz. Five doodz crowded aroung the one 8-ish ( scale) girl in the room is not my idea of a Part'e.. or even a good time really. I am not into C-low and ladies if you are out to meet a man with gold in his teeth workin on that grillz step up and get yer shake on.  My hat is not twisted to the side, my pants are not at my knees and I certainly did not stumble in from the Mill Avenue cue club. I will give them the fact hey don't over charge for the drinks, but ehh thats about it..   I can remember thinking to my self.. Self why am I here. Self am I and my friend too old to appreciate this? Am I the second oldest guy in the room? Who knows what that other guy was doing there.  I didn't ask him any questions.  The charm and glamor of the 20 something girl who like a sirens song led me into the rocks of this place will not get me again..  Fool me three times shame on you..Anything past that I think I know what I am getting myself into anyway.  Reading the reviews about the restaurant I will try this place again in the day time but avoid it and stumble a few doors down to another place before I get into a cab for the long ride home.

Good after bar food... Good before bar food.. I am in LOVE with the Lamb Vindaloo pie.  Now I don't have much experience with "pastys" in England..( or anywhere else:) but BOTH the locations here serve as good as yer gonna get in the PHX area.   Cool atmosphere to experience..Learn about what a pasty is..and drink from the copious beer selection. (beer snob)  Gotta love the service too.. attentive attractive ..Prolly one of the places to be for World Cup Football fans out there!

So this place is a bit trendy I guess. Neon lights under the bar, mainstream trance playing a bit too loud for my old age and its dark enough to be some club, BUT the food is outstanding. I've been here a few times and with my most recent visit and few others we have requested the sushi chef just make something up and give us a one off type specialty roll and I would recommend it to anyone. The sauces this guy comes up with are really top notch. It has to be the main sushi guy (I think his names Johny?) or else I have had the sushi fall apart with some of the maybe lesser under studies.  A bit pricey sure but when you ask for shtuff off the menu and they play your game you have to play theirs and it's probably going to cost you.  The ambiance in the day time is a little more suited to a quiet sushi dining experience just so you know. Really the only place to grab fish in the down town area and after some event or a stroll around the Roosevelt area it is a welcome addition to our fair city.   I have experience less than perfect service, at times I think I felt forgotten betrayed and lonely, but it was usually busy and I will give them a pass on dinging them for that to a certain degree... O.k., I take away one star.

We got a couples massage for my birthday present!! and the experience was first rate for me.  This is no happy ending establishment type thing BTW so get yer mind outta the gutter..  The two individuals who came to my place were on time and professional. Organized and friendly. they were both early actually and I am pretty sure we went over a bit past our "time". I would recommend the guy I had to anyone.  This guy got tension out of my calf's I didn't even know I had until he got rid of it. His name is "Seth Alifi"  licenced and talented. The price was $75 per person and I have to say the service was certainly worth the price.  Yes great service!!  and if they come to you so its about as easy as ya get. When the people came I was not sorry they came in at all.  I would still take go to a spa if you want to be really pampered but this is a really easy and casual.  My girl friend had a different experience with her lady ..So I would obviously take that into consideration when posting that in the nature of being a good and thorough yelp 'er. Like anything it depends on the individual person doing but this instance I would definitely say I am a fan!

Awesome atmosphere cant best happy hour all day on Mondays.. Looking out at the phoenix megalopolis this phoenix home has been transformed into an oasis near down town.  Its 1940s style gentrified house into a great watering hole and more. Sorta reminds me of the lost leaf wood floors and outside patio n such. Many draft beers to choose from a perfect place to come to for a few drinks and a gourmet style soup , salad sandwich .. and even a all beef hot dog which may make you reconsider your life decision of not eating them. I saw a range of people there from fixed gear tattoo covered hip-sters to people my parents age drinking the Merlot and getting into the mini van after.  The music was some ones very eclectic down tempo electronic chill mix peppered with an assortment of emo ish / mild hip hop rap stuff..  I guess further reinforcing my hypothesis that there indeed may be, some thing for everything here.  We had a range of things from a house made salsa to a meat and cheese dish for appetizers. After 4 beers two hours a basketball game and some salsa I think it was round a 20 spot. Nice. They got a bar.. I guess.. Real limited to what you can order. Plasma TV for all you sports junkies. Certainly a good vibe'd spot to hang out. Certainly a stop next pub crawl I embark on that direction.

So.. I won't repeat the rest of the reviews on here. Take it from me its all the same. Full disclosure: I did actually stay here for close to a month on and off so that says something to their credit.   Anyway straight up, if you can get this place on the cheap and need a place to crash its ok. It is what it is. Its a thrice renovated Days Inn next to the gay bars in central Phoenix. If you go there with that expectation anything past that might pleasantly surprise you. When I actually saw the place and compared it to the picture I had a new appreciation for the photoshop skills of the web guy, just sayin...   The room was clean enough ( except I found remnants of "adult toys" under the bed, yuck) and the water is hot. I was there to sleep and it fit the bill good enough.  The hall ways have that old Days Inn smell from millions of drug fueled parties from back when you could smoke in hotels rooms, and a lot of the clients seems to be there to sleep off a bender that lasted a few days as they walked back to the bus station but it was quiet and the air conditioner worked well.   They charged $59 a night due to the construction and I would say that it was a deal when you factor in the included health club membership across the street and continental breakfast in the morning.   News flash... they are calling it hotel 502 now and seem to be gutting the rooms.  It looks like a complete renovation so who knows maybe they are going to correct the sins of the past?  Last thing: The room pricing seems to be negotiable as quoted me a range of prices and occasionally they tried to adjust the price and I talked them out of it, so you might wanna get your bargaining hat out.
