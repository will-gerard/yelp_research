I was very disappointed.  Let me walk you through it:  1) The restaurant it self needs to be updated.  The ambiance and d√©cor was similar to that of a Black Angus.  Just not very classy.  Tables were pretty small too.  2) The service was slightly lacking in the sense I waited about 20 minutes for my cocktail.  Other than that our server was pleasant and patient with me as a first timer  3) I had the Moscato Mule which tasted like soda.  Barely any vodka in my $15 drink.  My friend had the red sangria which was bitter.  I wanted a glass of champagne which they did not offer.  Just a flat super sweet prosecco.   4)  We started with the Alpine cheese fondue which tasted like pure white wine.  We then switched to the Cheddar fondue which was actually pretty tasty  5) I ordered the Caesar salad which had these weird sweet crunchy things on it which did not compliment the salad at all.  I took a couple of bites and that was enough  6) I ordered the Surf and Turf with the Coq Au Vin cooking style.  The flavor was so bland and disappointing.  For a filet and lobster meal, this fell very short  7) The yin and yang chocolate was our dessert.  The white chocolate portion was delicious.  Best part of the whole night  8) My bill, for just me, was $62 BEFORE tip!  For this kind of money I expect to be wowed not underwhelmed which is exactly what I was   9) After all of this, I ended my night on the toilet!  My stomach was so upset from this!  Maybe this was TMI but seriously!

My sister and I stopped in her after a movie to enjoy some coffee.  I am a frequent flyer of Starbucks and visit them at least 3 times a week.  I had never been to this particular location before and I will NEVER go back!  The barista was so rude, like, unbelievably rude.  And of course she didn't have on a name tag so....She was thin, brunette, mouse-y looking.  I politely asked her for a couple of waters to go along with my order and she ROLLED HER EYES at me and said "Yeah ok".  When I then tried to confirm my order was correct with her, she acted all offended and said "I'm sure it's right ok?" again, with a very rude tone.  I've never been treated this way at a Starbucks.  They should be embarassed.

I am so disappointed.  I stop here 2-3 times a week and today, they screwed my drink up AGAIN for like the 3rd time in the last couple of months.  I had to leave work to go back and have them fix it which is beyond frustrating and super inconvenient.  The kicker is they repeated my order back TWICE and repeated it correctly yet it was still not made right.  I was in the food/bevarage service industry for 10+ years and rarely did a customer have to return something back to me because I screwed it up.  No offense but this is NOT THAT HARD!  It drives me crazy when things like this happen often.  I understand every now and then but 3 times in the last 7-8 weeks is a little excessive.  I just don't think I can come back to this location because if I do and they screw my order up again, I might just lose it lol.

I go to the Wildflower in Gilbert quite often and enjoy the food.  I stopped in here during a shopping trip at Chandler Mall and I won't be going back.  The salad was smaller than I'm used to.  They didn't give my son a cookie with his kid's meal.  The guy taking our order was acting erratic as if he was on drugs or something.  There was another employee walking around who looked like he hadn't showered in a week and his pants were sagging and his underwear was hanging out.  Even the customers were rude!  Very bad experience

Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'm not sure if it's because there's a language barrier or if the staff here just generally does not care about taking care of their customers. I did not like what I ordered which has never happened here before. When I tried to talk to my server about it, she was very standoffish and dismissive. I told her I didn't care for it her only response was didn't you read the description of what you ordered? When I asked for something else she says I don't think so and walked away. I grab the attention of a different server and informed her that I wasn't happy with what I ordered and she says the same thing well didn't you read what you ordered? I've told her it doesn't matter if I read it or not if I order something here and I don't like it I should be able to order something else. She then tells the manager who then tells her to tell me, never even comes up to me to talk about this himself, that we won't be charged.  I wasn't looking for a free meal I just wanted a meal in general! I asked the server again if I could just get something else and she told me I don't think so. So even though I didn't have to pay for my meal, I left there hungry and extremely upset. Never in my life have I dined a restaurant that didn't allow you to order something else if you didn't like your meal. I can't believe I was treated this way. It's as if they were basically telling me we don't like you don't never come back. Because that's exactly what's going to happen I'm never going back. There are way too many places in the Eastvalley that serve great sushi and great service. This place is not worth the headache.

I took my two-year-old son into get his second haircut. We would've taken him to the first place he had been to but they didn't have any openings. So we figured we would give fantastic Sams a try. I do not remember the name of the woman that cut my sons hair but if I remember correctly she had curly blond hair. Long story short she did a terrible job at cutting his hair. Actually she didn't even really cut his hair she just trimmed the bottom half inch of his head and that was it. Extremely disappointed

I've been coming to this Fry's for over two years since I moved to the area. At first I didn't have many complaints everything was just okay. But more recently actually, I've been noticing they run out of things or they have expired items on the shelves or their produce is no good or things don't ring in right I'm constantly having to go back to return items and get refunds or credits. Think I need to start looking for another grocery store.

I stop here on occasion when I'm not feeling lazy and crave a better tasting coffee outside of starbucks drive thru. Always see the same guy working solo which can get a bit annoying if there's a line and I'm in hurry but no big deal. My last visit there will he just that, my LAST. He was more interested in chatting with his wife then he was in serving the 3 or 4 people waiting in line. I probably spent at least 15 minutes just standing there waiting. This to me is unprofessional and uncalled for.

The only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is because it is a really NICE gym.  Lots of amenities IE cafe, salon, classes.  But here are the problems:  1) They charge WAY too much!  I pay $55 a month whereas any other gym I've been a part of is$30 or less  2) The staff SUCKS!  Personal trainers are super FAKE and stuck up.  The coordinators or whatever you call them are also very fake and pushy salespeople.  I tried to cancel my membership and they incented me by saying they would give me $150 LT bucks to use but then I never actually received them!  3) This place is always crowded.  And most of the members are not friendly or polite and will run you down in the hall like you don't even exist!  4) You know those commercials for planet fitness where the guy is shoving his abs in everyone's face?  Yeah, a lot of THOSE types of people come here too  If you are looking for a super expensive, fancy gym and you have a tight tone body and like to stick your nose in the air, this place is for you!  If you are like me and trying to get in shape or maintain your workout regimen and want an easy going no pressure atmosphere, steer clear of Lifetime

I was really craving a steak and didn't feel like waiting over an hour at the keg. I have been here once or twice before and, although it's not the best steak in the world, it was always pretty decent for the price. This night in particular I didn't even get to have a steak. I ordered my steak rare because I prefer it a true medium rare and most places like this tend to over cook the steak. My first steak was almost a medium well and my second steak was literally raw! Like not even cooked would've killed me if I ate it raw! I asked for the dressing on my salad on the side which it was not it was nothing but dressing barely edible. Our server never wrote our order down pretty sure that was part of the problem. Bad service plus bad food = a one star review

Beware! Yogurt here is just as bad as ice cream! Only one fat free flavor! At least that's what the dingbat girl at the counter told me. Don't get me wrong, yogurt was good but I choose frozen yogurt because it's supposed to be a healthier option.

I purchased a Groupon which was 50% off and used it at the sushi bar.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Decent service, tasty sushi, reasonable prices.  If I'm in this area again and crave sushi, I'll stop in.

I've been going to this total wine pretty much since it opened. Although I've never been too big a fan of their customer service, I still continue to stock up on my wine and beer here because they have great prices and an awesome selection. One time, I was told to purchase a certain bottle of Chardonnay by one of the associates and he stated that I should really like it. When I got home and had a glass, it was probably the most disgusting thing I've ever had. On my next visit to total wine, I communicated to the gentleman who suggested it to me that I did not care for it. He had said if I had brought that bottle back rather than throwing it out, they would have replaced it with something else. Knowing this, the next time, and yes there was a next time, I got a bad bottle of wine I returned it to the store and exchanged it with no issues. It almost tasted like it had already been open for days I think the term for that is oxidized? Fast-forward several months later, I had purchased a bottle of Sterling Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley. I've had this wine dozens of times before and I've always enjoyed it. It's not cheap at $27 a bottle. When I got it home, I poured a glass tasted it and it tasted like rubbing alcohol. Again not sure the term but I think it's oxidized. So, I headed back to the store to attempt to exchange it for something else. The manager I spoke to, and of course I can't remember his name, told me "there's nothing we can do". No exchange, no refunds, not even an I'm sorry, nothing literally nothing this guy did nothing. You could've at least give me a coupon or something! I've spent thousands of dollars here and I am completely offended by the way that I was treated. If you buy a $27 a bottle of wine and you take it home and the product is bad  somebody should take care of that and not just brush me off like oh I guess you're just sol very disappointed and probably need to find a different place to shop for my beer and wine

The customer service at this location is atrocious. I was there recently making a purchase when a large sign fell on me ripping my earring out of my ear and cutting my wrist. When I brought this to the attention of the manager his only response was do you want a bandaid? I didn't realize my earring was missing until after I had left. When I went back to retrieve my earring a couple of days later I was greeted with the same terrible customer service. The woman that I spoke with when I was trying to explain the situation to her told me I have no idea what you're talking about and rolled her eyes. I can't keep going back it's just not worth the headache and then treated like this. Next time something may fall on me and actually hurt me and nobody will care. I didn't get a single I'm sorry not a smile nothing.

I've been here hundreds of times and it's always been good, not great but, good. The only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is because they had "name that tune" which was a lot of fun. Outside of that, the service was horrible. It started with my attempt to arrange transportation to Jjs. I contacted mike about 45 minutes before I needed a ride as Jjs provides a courtesy shuttle. He told me they don't really "schedule" rides and to just call back about 5 minutes before I needed to be picked up. Ok....so I call 5 minutes before and then he tells me 15 minutes?!? Wtf?!? So at this point, and after sensing his clear disinterest in helping me, I decide to just take myself there. Now because of this, I've chosen not to drink since I now have to drive. My plan was to spend a ton of money there on drinks for me and my friends so, looks like Jjs just lost money.   Now on to the bartender. 1) slower than molasses 2) never seen her there before, perhaps she is new 3) flat at rude, was ignored twice while clearly waiting for service 4) lied and said she was the manager 5) did not smile once 6) aren't you supposed to personable and friendly of you're a bartender? Someone get this girl a personality! 7) when called out on the above, she rolled her eyes, pouted like a child then walked away!

Everytime I come here there is NO one working and all the fitting rooms are closed.  Last time I came here I had my son in is stroller with me and the only fitting room that was open had the big room LOCKED!!  And then I couldn't find anyone to unlock it!  I had about $400 worth of clothing to try on and ended up not buying anything because I couldn't try anything on.  Not going back

I've been over a size 12 for the majority of my adult life and one thing that's always frustrated me is never being able to find cute affordable clothing in plus sizes. Most of the places you go i.e. Lane Bryant, department stores etc. have not so cute nor flattering outfits for bigger women but also more expensive. Torrid has always been a lifesaver for me their clothes  are cute, prices are reasonable and this particular store has an outstanding retail staff.

I'm an avid BBW shopper.  Never had any problems using my emailed scannable coupons until I came here.  The girl kept saying she was looking for an expiration date??  Funny, I went to a different location a couple days later and they scanned the coupon with no problems.  Customer service must not be a priority at this location for loyal customers

I was told upon entering the store everything was buy one get one half off.  I chose two pairs of earrings.  When I want to purchase them at the register, I was told the sterling silver earrings were NOT part of the promotion.  So apparently NOT everything in the store was buy one get one half off!  And I guess they wanted me to buy a cheaper pair of earrings to give me 50% off the 2nd set.  How does that even make any sense?

I'm a froyo junkie and I'm never too excited about their yogurt but still check it out every now and then to see if they have anything good. I have to say it annoys the crap out of me you have to ask for samples and I'm pretty sure it annoys the people that work there too since that's the attitude they have when you ask. I think I'll drive the extra 7 minutes to yogurtland where the yogurt is better and I can have all the samples I want

Been here a dozen times and its always been just ok. This time I waited an hour for sushi! Pretty sure the waitress didn't ring in half our order. Sat here 20 minutes without water.  Spicy salmon roll was salmon roll with a dollop of sriacha on top? Only reason why I'm Giving it two stars and not one is because the live music was pretty good. Won't be back any time soon.

I've only been in this store a handful of times, mainly with friends as I didn't think they had plus sizes. This last time I went in the store with my sister I noticed they had a plus Sized section. I'm not sure if this is new or what? But I was extremely excited considering the items were cute and reasonably priced. I started grabbing probably about a dozen items and no one came to help me! My arm was about to break and even looking around the store I couldn't see anyone that worked there. I proceeded to go to the dressing room where I quickly found out that there plus sizes were not sized right. I wear size 14 or 16 depending on the brand or an XL or one X some of the items in their store I had to get in a 2x or 3x because they ran so small. After trying on a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and realizing that they didn't have my size in 90% of the things that I wanted to buy I finally proceeded to locate a customer service rep who then had no interest in helping me. She literally just walked around the plus size section moving things around without even looking at them. I then took the three or four items that I wanted to purchase to the checkout line. The line was about five or six people long and they only had one girl working the cash register who is extremely slow. They had security tags on every thing even five dollar tank tops. She also was rude and long story short I highly doubt I will come back to the store.

Yum yum yum!! Is there crack in their yogurt? Seriously crave it and am there at least twice a week. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last time I was there someone screwed up and didn't make cookies n cream!

Ditto to most of what everyone else is saying, too busy, poor parking, rude staff.  I was so excited when this opened since it's the closest Starbucks to my house with a drive-thru.  I have an infant son so it's so much easier than going inside usually but not in this case.  The line is always too long and everyone piles up and blocks everyone in.  My most recent experience here will be my last.  It was Saturday 4/19, around noon.  I pulled in and intended to enter the drive thru on the north side of the lot, where there are no cars parked but everyone else decided to join the line through the parking lot which defeated the purpose of trying to not block anyone in.  I then decided to just park and go inside.  My order was a venti coffee with 2 pumps sugar free cinnamon dolce syrup and a iced venti half caff skinny caramel latte.  It wasn't until later in the day, while shopping at the mall, my sister and I noticed that, per what was written on our cups, we did NOT have the right orders.  They forgot the skinny part of my latte and gave my sister regular cinnamon not sugar free.  Being on a strict diet for health reason, sugar and fat found in 2% milk are big no-no's.    I decided to call the store to discuss this with them.  Normally I wouldn't care but, as mentioned above, with my health issues it's important for the people who make these drinks to know how important it is to NOT screw them up.  Simply repeating the order could help.  I asked for a manager and got Melissa.  I asked Melissa what the coding on the cups meant rather than just assuming they were wrong, I wanted to make sure.  She immediately became frustrated with me and said there are only two people working.  That's not my problem!  You guys screwed up my drink and you need to tell me what you plan to do to fix the problem!  She then said to go ahead and come back and they will make me a new one.  I'm sorry but I'm not going to pack up my infant son back in to the car just to drive all the way back there.  In the past, if my order is messed up, and it happens from time to time, other Starbucks would offer to make me a new one WHENEVER I wanted to come back.  Melissa was not offering this and didn't even give me a chance to finish my discussion with her.  She simply said well I'm trying to make it right and then hung up on me!  I worked as a bartender/waitress for 10 years and in sales/service for another 8 years and I'm sorry but this is not how you treat people!  Corporate needs to fix this store ASAP!  I'm sure they will continue to get business as it's the only Starbucks in a 5 mile radius but that doesn't make it OK.  They should be ashamed of themselves......

I seriously can't stop thinking about their new Oreo flavor! One side is the cookie flavor and the other side is the frosting filling flavor. They're great swirled but the actual filling flavor is so ridiculously good! The girls that work there are always super friendly and the atmosphere is just overall awesome. Can't wait to go back

Stopped in here since my usual spot couldn't get me in.  There was a bit of confusion on the cost of their pedicure service.  They had a sign that said $21 and a banner that said 10% off but apparently you can't combine the two discounts together.  I had a gel manicure, which was pretty good, eyebrow wax which was ok but my pedicure wasn't that great.  The massage was just him lightly rubbing my legs/feet.  He painted my toenails poorly and when he was done they were just a mess.  When I asked someone else to fix it, she seemed uninterested in doing so but, did it anyway.  Not too impressed

I love Dutch Brothers coffee and prices however, this location is a nightmare. It's conveniently located on my way to work but they're been numerous times I've stopped in to get coffee and turned around and drove away. The drive-through line is always at least eight cars long before 9 AM and there's always at least 2 to 4 people in line inside. Normally this wouldn't be so bad except the people that work here like to chitchat 5 to 10 minutes with each person. This location would do a lot better if when they're busy they were just hammer out the drinks.

Nothing bad to say about this place. Always a good time. It is a little expensive though so be warned. Do you go on a Friday or Saturday night it can be pretty busy also. The recline and dine cinemas are probably the best part

I am saddened to have to write this review. My son loves fat cats and we go there 2 to 4 times a month. Each time we are there we get a pizza from Pizzini. The pizza itself isn't bad, I've had better but, not bad. The problem with this restaurant is the staff. 75% of the time I either don't receive something I've ordered or what I've ordered is wrong. My most recent experience we ordered a margarita and received some sort of red drink with basil leaves in it. I ordered a pizza half margarita half pepperoni and received a margarita pizza. I ordered a side salad never received it. The best part is when you ask the staff to fix the problem it's as if they have no interest in doing so. Every other restaurant I've ever been to and mind you I've also been employed in the restaurant industry for several years, if you mess up you own your mistake and you do whatever it takes to put a smile on your customer face. I understand the restaurants can make mistakes but they make them constantly and have no remorse for it. If you're near fat cats and are hungry go to blue lemon, the food is better and the waitstaff is as well
