I normally frequent an old-style barber shop so Estique was a bit out of my norm.  My hair stylist Cyndra was very welcoming and did a superb job; better than my barber whom I've been seeing for 5+ years.  I definitely recommend this salon for men's cuts and highly recommend Cyndra for any work that needs to be done.  I will be booking her for my future visits.

Great 'old school' barber.  My father went to Benny years ago and now I have been going to him.  Straight razor cut and shave is top notch.  Would recommend to anyone who asks.

One star is one too many.   I went on my lunch break, 12pm; granted it's a busy time, took about 40 minutes. I'm okay with that. The cleaning was subpar. The windows looked like they used dirty water and newspaper to clean them.   I deliberately left a commemorative quarter in one of my cup holders, (gold plated state quarter, not worth anything more than .25 cents), to see if it would be there after the wash. It wasn't...   I will never go back to this location nor another location for that matter. I'll save the over priced, $15 and change it cost for the service and use it at one of their competitors.

Best food truck around! If I was were able to rate two thumb up in addition to stars, I would.    I tried the California Burger, very tasty; avocado, pickled red onions, pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli and a sunny side egg to top it all off... If that's not a flavor blast in your mouth I don't know what is.   I invite anyone, whether you have a sophisticated pallet or not, to indulge in the deliciousness that is Aioli Gourmet Burgers.  Great food,  great staff what else could you ask for?
