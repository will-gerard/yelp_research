I shop here often the selection can be some what lacking in the men's department. Beyond that this particular location continues to amazes me with there inability to remove security tags. I've been forced to drive back to the store twice in as many visits to have the security tags removed. PLUS the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing. After this last trip I'm returning everything I purchased, I'm tired of having to go back to the store just to have a tag removed considering how over my shoulder the staff was... Basically Dillard's you suck...

Awesome shop without a doubt, friendly and very informative. I drove 40 minutes because of all of the positive reviews, and I'm happy I did. Thank you Jennifer and Jeff, and a special thank you too the mechanic who did the work. I didn't catch his name but he went out of his way to answer questions for me.
