ZERO if I could! I have been renting cars for employees for well over 10 years, this was my worst experience to date. I rented through a third party like I always do, also got the insurance through them like I always do. The guy at the car rental counter, Thor, up-sold my employee on their insurance for more than the car cost per day. The way that Thor snuck this in was by telling my guy that he was just initialing for the insurance that we had already paid for. My employee had his insurance form with him and showed this to Thor, but he worded it just right and sold him $89 worth of insurance anyways. I called Dollar when I found this out and they said they couldn't take the insurance off over the phone and he would have to go to a dollar location to get it resolved. I let them know that he was working 3 hours away from the nearest Dollar location and I couldn't afford to have him leave the job to go deal with this. Then they told me he could try to have it removed when the car is returned, it would be at the managers discretion, of course that didn't happen. In addition he was an hour late returning the car, they charged him an extra day rental and an extra day of the insurance we didn't want in the first place. The WORST customer service I have ever dealt with on a local and corporate level. Don't be fooled by the low prices they offer, you will pay double what you planned on one way or another. This was supposed to be a $177 rental including insurance, turned out to be a double insured rental costing us over $300. There goes the budget!

More of a joke than their bait-and-switch tactics that Dollar pulled on my employee at the time of the rental is their customer service after the fact. I contacted them on December 8th, 2011 with a complaint and here is the response that I got this morning, January 18th, 2012. Mr. Sparks is my employee, I clearly stated in my communications that I was his boss and the one that set up the reservation. They obviously didn't read my email very carefully, or my huge signature and contact information at the bottom. This is absolutely unacceptable!   Dear Mr. Sparks,  Thank you for notifying us of your recent experience with Dollar Rent A Car in Phoenix.  We appreciate the opportunity to assist.  We disclose all rental charges at the commencement of the rental to inform you of all charges and to explain the benefit of any protection you select.  A review of your rental contract indicates your acceptance of the LDW by your signature acknowledging the charge.  Final review of your rental information confirms all amounts appear to be in order.  Based on the available information, I must respectfully decline your request for a refund of the amount in question.  At Dollar Rent A Car, we strive to provide quality products and friendly, efficient service.  You are a valued customer and your comments are extremely important to us. Thank you once again, Mr. Sparks, for taking the time to notify us of this situation.  We look forward to serving you again soon at Dollar Rent A Car.    Sincerely,  Ebony Harding Customer Service Representative      Case ID: 1728097

This was my first experience buying a vehicle over the internet. Jake and Dylan made it a very easy transaction. Dylan worked to get me a great interest rate on my loan, they took care of all the necessary paperwork for my tax and license fees in Colorado and got me on the road quickly. I would have opted to have the truck delivered to me in CO but I have family in AZ so I took advantage of the opportunity to pick the truck up and have some time to visit with them.  When it comes time to purchase another vehicle, I will start my search with JBA Motors first.
