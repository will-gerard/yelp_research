We're not garden folks. Steven took us around and gave us excellent service! Professional, courteous, and knowledge made this a great experience. We'll be coming here for all of our questions and planting needs. A hidden gem in the South Mountain region. We bought a combination of herbs and done hibiscus. Can't wait to use what we learned today when we get home.

A bit frustrated as we drove all the way over here to meet some friends. Our friends were at the bar waiting for us but there was a lady at the door not allowing us in because they someone was having a 'rehearsal dinner.' They put a sign on the front door, 'we've reached maximum capacity' and that was just tacky. If you're having a private party or special event, turn off the OPEN sign and put a sign up that says Private Event Tonight.

The lox and bagel on an everything bagel was perfect. It hit the spot! Service was superb too - Julia behind the counter had impeccable customer service skills. Fresh coffee and the patio was great at 0730 in the morning.  Coming back soon!

I don't come often at all and Kevin at the counter noticed my military ID in my wallet and asked if I was in the military.  He proceeded to give me a military discount afterwards. His customer service skills were impeccable and he paid attention to details. Five stars for the service of this young man. My peanut butter mooed was also delicious.

Office staff are excellent. religious education personnel are wonderful. I've had nothing but great experiences with this church and the community. I've been to funerals, baptisms, confirmations, Easter and Christmas celebrations and they've always been pleasant and peaceful.

Food was really good. The service today was the best I've had. Angela took excellent care of us and we had a great late lunch. Two merlots and a large pizza. Her recommendations were spot on. Definitely coming back. Mo (socks) was very kind as well.

It was much better than expected. I had the spicy Korean noodle soup with lettuce wraps. They were very good. I can see us returning for take out or delivery. Dining in is less likely because we enjoy uncle bears next door as an option. We'd order again from here until we have a reason not to.  Fast and delicious.

The high reviews of this place are well earned. I'm not comparing their pizza to dine in facilities but to delivery stores and these guys are awesome. Plenty of coupons online, I didn't use any cause I was in a rush and needed food ASAP and they delivered. Fast, earlier than stated, and the dough was delicious for delivery.

This place has good people working there. My personal recommendation is Angie but you really can't go wrong with anyone here. Arlan and Stephanie are also great with the kiddos. The app for the phone is also very convenient.

kentucky fried chicken so what are you expecting? the chicken way is better than what i had expected but what made my experience stand out was the service of one young man. it really seems as if they were short handed today but this young black man named Cuevon? was cool as ice. He not only handled the entire walk in without breaking a sweat but he did so professionally and with pride. If I had any business that was hiring, he'd be exactly what I want as the face of the company.

First time I went here I set the bar low and this place hurdled it easily. This time I had the bar set high after my first experience and it still crushed it. Hands down best restaurant in Arizona. ONLY 5 STAR RESTAURANT and its obvious. The martinis, whoa. Think Matthew McCanaughy from Wolf of Wall St and just keep them coming!

My daughter got in a car accident and Joseph Brown took excellent care of us. He was professional and always forthcoming. Communicated with us every step of the way. He made sure my daughter was taken care of and referred us to the right people. When we had some of our own people to use, he never pushed back. In the last 4 months, I have yet to feel pressured by this law firm. Mr. Brown has been incredible and he'll have our family as clients for life.

Matt from Virginia with 2 kids was one of the best servers I've ever had. He was considerate and excelled at customer service. The food at Z is excellent. I had the achiote chicken Cobb salad. Its my default meal here. Bloody Mary bar is top notch in this area.

The food was good not great. I had the black and blue Burger which was good but smaller than expected. Bloody Mary was good not great. Coffee was good too. The reason why it went from a standard 3 stars to 4 stars was our server Cassie. She was great. Fast, prompt, professional, and just made us feel at home. BJs needs to hire more of her kind.

Hidden GEM. I don't remember how I found this place but I'm glad I did. It's a hidden gem. The food was way better than I expected and the service was great. I had about 45 minutes to burn before a business meeting and happened to pull into this parking lot. Went inside for something to drink and kill time when I decided to eat. Told them I was on a time constraint and they accommodated. I love Chinese food and I'm pretty picky in Arizona but this place was not a disappointment and the prices were fair.

Great place for lunch. Been here a couple of times and I've never been disappointed. Iced Tea with the giant Green Chile Burro. WOW. Place is family friendly, priced perfect, and the service was excellent. Lunch never takes too long and the atmosphere is fun and relaxed. They really make you feel like you're part of a new family here.

I am so disappointed. Look at my previous reviews of other Dos and I am typically very fair. This place had a good server but the manager was lousy to say the least. We visit this place once a month and bring a group of ten to fifteen people with us so you would think they would provide quality service but two guys at the bar wanted to hear the game. I like football so I get it but the speakers were blasting so loud it actually hurt. We moved to another location and it helped a bit but another group came in and had the same complaint, they also moved. Manager insisted and wouldn't lower the volume because of the two gentlemen at the bar. So our group of twelve in a bar with 16 people in it would've been better off going elsewhere.  Customer service by management here was terrible.  We won't be back next month or anytime after that.

My second time with a large group of people and it was just as bad, probably worse. The food tasted great! Green chili burger was fabulous. Service was as good as it could be. Obviously something is terribly disorganized behind the scenes cause it takes forever to get a meal here. Worst of all, we had reservations! It was more than a 2 hour lunch when we had planned for a 1 hour lunch. Needless to say, expectations were far from met. Too many good restaurants in the area to settle for this.

Came to celebrate a special occasion with our family. The Bourbon with Vanilla Beans and Figs was incredible and highly recommended. I had two of those along with the lamb. The food is very expensive as are the drinks but the service is excellent. For a high end expensive restaurant, I give it 4 stars. Not quite 5 stars comparing it to other high end restaurants. I'd definitely come back again.

Pizza is great. Doesn't matter which one either. Grab a recommended bottle of wine. The number one reason this place is a 5 stars is the service. Service and ambiance make this place a must go to place with your family, friends, or business associates.

Whoever took my phone my phone order was incredible. Seems petty but quality customer service is already tough to find, to get it over the phone is just a sigh of relief. The food is great! Got the family package to make it easy for a big birthday dinner. Definitely the best Chinese food in Phoenix!

I don't understand the bad reviews. It's a brand new place in a brand new location that's much bigger and better than what it was before. I love the selection, I actually got more than I expected out of it. And there was a service employee in every aisle so there was no shortage of help. The staff are friendly and available. It would've been five stars if some of the items weren't so expensive. Otherwise its a great place to get party items.

I can't vouch for the rooms because I didn't stay here but I did attend a conference and the service was excellent. Gabriella (Gabby) tended the small bar they had and she was top of the line. If all employees were like Gabby there wouldn't be any bad reviews.

The atmosphere was terrific. Outdoors, birds chirping, colorful foliage all around. The menu is excellent and I had the brisket which was much better than expected. I asked about the chefs special for the day and read that the asparagus omelette was delicious. Unfortunately it was broccoli today so I went with the brisket. My server was Gabriela and she was the icing on the cake. Great recommendations, great service, great atmosphere. Peaceful, and a welcome break during a hectic day. I completed some work while I was there and plan on returning in the future since I work around the corner from this peaceful place.

I'm on a low carb diet and I had the fajitas sans tortilla and rice, added pico and avocado and it was delicious.  I would give the food a 4 but Jen, the bartender, makes this place a 5+. I travel a lot and meet a lot of people. This gal is a quality gal. She catered to my diet and is the epitome of great customer service. This is by far the best Dos Gringos I've ever been to because of the people that work there. I'm not going every day because I don't live nearby but I'll make the visit for those steak and shrimp fajitas and the customer service!

The only reason why this place scored as high as I'm giving it is because of the service of a couple of the ladies there. The food was not what I had come to expect out of this place. I've eaten here probably two or three other times and was satisfied but this was not one of those times. I was by myself waiting for someone to get done with their conference in the back so I sat alone. My server treated me as if I were there with a party of ten and gave me plenty of attention. I had a martini which was excellent seeing it was huge with the shaker on the side. I had an appetizer and the steak with the bread pudding and I'd give it 3 of 5 stars. Pricey? Sure but it's what I expected coming here and I'd come back but these folks need to step it up in the kitchen if they want to compete because there's plenty of competition around.

We got a combo of the fish and chips and soup. It was delicious. Super high carb so we didn't finish all of it but it was excellent and the beer was excellent too. I'd come back if I was craving beer and British-like food.

Easily the best place I've been to in Scottsdale. Food was incredible and to my surprise the service was top notch. Erika took care of our table and she was phenomenal. If every restaurant had an Erika they'd be a hit. Great appetizers, the bar was awesome. I can't complain.

I stuck in bed and needed food other than pizza so I Yelped delivery food and it gave me this place. Very happy. I ordered pot stickers, chicken fried rice, and orange chicken. From best to worst in that order. Orange chicken wasn't bad just the other two were much better. I'd definitely use these guys again!

Tuesday night wings! I don't know the exact promo but I know the parking lot is fully and the place is jumping. I usually get 4 of the 6 rubs for my wings and I'm satisfied. The food is good not great. Service is a hit or miss but overall I'd give it a 4. Lots of work needed to get the 5 star review but I'd default here on Tuesday sans cooking.

Rating only based on customer service as the selection is massive and the stores are clean. 5 of 5 on customer service. I always feel like the most important customer when I'm looking for anything in these stores and that didn't change from one location to the next. I'm definitely a fan.

The food may be good but man the service is horrific. I can't comment on the food because I've been here almost an hour and no food. It took about 20 minutes just to get water. No the place isn't packed and swamped as there are empty seats everywhere.  Put the wait in at Ling Lings cause this place is horrible.  One bright spot, Ann the hostess was awesome! The best last if the place was the hostess named Ann!

The burritos are good enough when you're craving breakfast and can't get away from work. I use them about once every couple of weeks. The service our horrible. Almost every time I call I get put on hold only to never get answered. I call back and finally get my order in. If there was another place that delivered I would go there.

Cold brisket, thick slices, and dry! Over cooked. Not good brisket. I don't even make brisket but when I go to BBQ joints like Rudy's in Austin, or even across the street, it's as close to perfect as possible. This was not good. Diced cold-slaw with no season. Plus - service was pleasant and cheerful. 2 stars for the service, 1 star for the food. I will not return to Rudy's in Chandler.

Our server Brooke was awesome and she did the best job she could. The kitchen was super slow and the drinks were mediocre. The place is trendy and the atmosphere was great but the drinks felt like there was no liquor in it and the food was okay. I was sadly disappointed and probably won't return because there are just too many places to go downtown.

The food was good but they needed more meat in it. the bloody marys are excellent, have a double. Our server Cardi, short for Bacardi, was great! She did an excellent job.  Only thing I would recommend is to have the hostess wipe the tables w a dry napkin prior to sitting folks. Really annoying to sit down on a WET table top!

Best dentistry I've every had. The office folks are awesome! The courtesy call is great but it was the research and homework they did that helped me receive a credit! A credit? who gets a credit at a dentist office? The dentist and the vet are the two places one always walks out lighter in the pocket yet these folks found a way to me money? I didn't even ask for it! I'm a fan and that's not even rating their excellent dentist work. I've shopped around in the past - I stopped shopping when I found Dr. Pulley and his staff.

Paul Cox helped me out with some business legal situations. He was easy to work with and listened to my needs. He asked many questions and advised me well. I didn't even feel like I was dealing with a lawyer, more like a confidante. Really glad I was referred to him and look forward using him in the future.

I've had pretty good experiences at different zipps throughout the valley. Today was a disaster. It wasn't the servers fault or the cooks either. Today was all management. It was empty when we came in, family of 8, and we wanted to see the noon World Cup game. It was empty, I repeat. We sat down and since the table was so small we added another small today to fit our large family. The server came up to us and told us afterwards that we weren't supposed to do this on game day, it was empty, but she'd allow it. So we ordered our first round of food & bloody Mary's because we were starving and thirsty. Then the manager comes up to us and tells us we weren't supposed to move any tables because its game day!? We look around to an empty restaurant and the hungry women state they're 'this' close to leaving since it's empty and we've already been scolded for moving a small table to our large family. He reminds us that's he's just communicating w us and the women had enough and grab their bags. That's six hungry and drinking adults plus to hungry kids, gone over what? Common sense dictates that in en empty restaurant you welcome families. We went to the Garage across the street. Too many good spots nearby to be harassed by a manager in an empty restaurant.

This is one if my favorite places in Ahwatukee. I love this place. The atmosphere and the food are excellent. I'm a low carber and they cater to my type. I almost always order the chili which is awesome. The chili and wings are an inexpensive meal with your choice of beer, golden. Can't go wrong with the burgers, I always ask to hold the bun. My biggest issue and the only reason why I dinged them to two stars was the service. Typically, I've had good service. Never been great but good enough. Tonight we had a young lady (don't remember her name but she had tattoos across her collarbone), she was friendly too but she was super slow. It took forever to get my wings and chili and it wasn't busy! She forgot my father's cocktail order. It was bad.  I'll come back but not for the service and with lower expectations.

Hidden gem. It has some minor work to do but it earned the five starts. Service was excellent, half the food from our big group came out fast, the other half not so fast, but it was still worth the wait. Appetizers were fast and held us through. Very authentic Peruvian food. I had the Chaufa, its Chinese/Peruvian food and excellent! I can't say enough about the Pisco Sour. The best I've ever had including in Peru!!!  Well return for more. Cheat day restaurant for my family.

My dad is old. Needed to use restroom badly. I understand it's a zoo out here during Superbowl weekend but really? Sucks because we ate here and they were friendly but the hostess on Saturday night was pretty mean about it. 1st they couldn't let him in to use the restroom, when I politely asked because he's old, NOT ME OR ANYONE ELSE JUST HIM,  she proceeded to allow him to use the restroom for $10 cover charge! Customer service down the drain.  Out of town elderly can use restrooms here for $10.  Bitter lost a family as customers tonight.

I had a surprisingly good experience at this place. My expectations were very high but I have expectations. As a low carb diet kind of guy I was a little worried but pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very lively and positive. The service was great too I asked for opinions and I got them. I asked for recommendations based off of my diet and received them. Just quality people here and I like that.

I had a great brunch with my 6 relatives here recently. The atmosphere was great. Parking was easy, back dirt lot, and the service was excellent. It was a bit more pricey than I thought it would've been but overall I had a great experience.  The traditional Mexican meals were good and their specialty drinks were excellent. Don't rack too many of those up though cause it's costly! I'm a fan.

I'm pleasantly surprised! My daughter said check out the new sushi place and we didn't even know this existed so we're really happy we came. I recommend the happy hour. Even with the happy hour it can get pricey but that's sushi for you! Much better than Ra across the freeway and competitive with local sushi spots. I'll return!
