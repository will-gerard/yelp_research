If you are looking for authentic goumet Italian food, this is not the place to go! The food is simple but tastes great. Good for large groups as the place is huge with many different rooms to be seated in. They offer a complete dinner: drink, bread, salad, entree, & ice cream for around $11. I had spaghetti & meatballs, pesto ranch on my salad, very tatsy- the hot sourdough was awesome and a scoop of spumoni ice cream. They offer whole wheat pasta, and gluten free pasta options. Full bar and friendly service. Happy Hour M-F 330 6pm. Give this place a try. Cool location, fun atmosphere, cheap prices

Awe man.. This Rainbow led to disappointment.  Stopped in for two dozen Saturday morning to treat my work team. 6am and the place was poppin! The donuts are good looking and the place is clean.. Also, I see they sell sandwiches.. Cool!   Picked out my teams favorites- long chocolate bars, maple iced, strawberry iced, chocolate iced, and a few others. The actual cooked dough is good. Not very sweet which I imagine some people enjoy, but not me! The not so sweet donuts with icing all tasted the same! I am quite certain their icing is just a thick glaze with food coloring! Zero flavor! Yes, even the chocolate!  I was looking forward to that artificial strawberry taste!   I feel this place is cheap with their product but not inexpensive for donut lovers!   Sorry to tell ya my fellow Yelpers! This rainbow has no gold at the end :(

$10 bucks and my Nine West kitten heels are like new! New heels, a buff, and same day service!   I called ahead asking for same day service (because I like to wait till the very last minute for most stuff). He said bring the heels in, no problem!  I was assisted by Nerick and he was friendly telling me about the services offered. Golf shoes, Cowboy Boots, luggage and handbag repair, you can even get keys made here. Alteration work is also offered & completed on site. They never send anything out.  Super convenient location on Central just North of Camelback. Quick, inexpensive and friendly.   I'll be back for several services!

Delivery from here is great! I have been getting pizza from here for a few years and I have not once had a problem. Well, one time they forgot my icing for my chocolate lava cake, but I forgave them quickly.  Quick, accurate, and delicious. Always a friendly delivery person with a smile !   Dominos has a great mobile app. Super easy to use and great coupons.   I'm not a fan of their bone in chicken wings they are too soft my liking. I recommend a thin and crispy crust and always extra sauce! We are also big fans of the Parmesan Bites! Perfect little bites of garlic bread!   If you haven't tried the Philly Cheesesteak pizza, you're missing out! I know! You wouldn't think it would be great, but we loved it!    Love the Chocolate Lava Cake! Soo good!  Ordered the marbled brownie cookie last night and it was bomb, too!   Don't forget to tip your driver!

Don't let online pictures fool you! I was looking for an apartment in the area& looked here because it's a very convenient location. This community looks attractive until you visit and look a little closer. The buildings are in poor condition and the inside of what we saw is even worse. Very outdated, odd color of counter tops, very cheap cabinets, stucco appeared to have water damage, and just an over all very cheap looking place. For the price they are asking there are several better options in the area. 2 stars for the friendly staff who I imagine have to hustle to get people to move in.

Congratulations! You have stumbled upon one of the finest restaurants in Phoenix!   Do not miss this place. Yes, you will see the reviews of the comparison to the sister company Houstons.. But what if you have never been to Houstons? Well let me tell you!   Superb service. Has yet to fail me. Friendly, attentive, efficient. A+. Delicious, top quality, well prepared food. Everything from the sushi, salads, sandwiches and steaks are delectable!    Great martinis. Extensive wine list. Possibly falling short on the selection of beer. Eh- I'm over that small tiny hiccup. Cheers!   I have dined here several times. The most recent time being Valentine's Day. I was sure we would be rushed out as we had a 6:45 reservation. I couldn't have been more wrong! We were seated by 6:55 and were able to enjoy our drinks and starter. This included the best service imaginable! Impressive! A must for any special occasion.   Hawaiian Rib Eye, Thai Steak Noodle Salad, Campfire Ribs, and the Prime Filet are my most favorites. The tuna mango sushi roll is so good!   Hillstone is on my list of favorites! Enjoy!

This place is decent! 2 eggs, potatoes, wheat toast $4.95 add a side of $1 "petite pancakes" (Whole wheat or buttermilk and u can add many different items to your pancakes, fruits, nuts, candy etc) Its a good cheap breakfast.   He had the granola, yogurt & fruit parfait to start which came out super cute with cinnamon sprinkled on top and in between layers.. $4.95 & super good. He added turkey sausage to the 2 egg breakfast & it was yum o!   Decent coffee, many healthy options to choose from, good service, good location with easy parking. Beats Denny's, & IHOP. Its not fancy, trendy, or cool & they don't serve booze. Its just decent food at a great price. Give this spot a try!

One of the best steaks I've ever had! The richest, beefiest, most delicious Ribeye imaginable!   Beautiful location in the fabulous Bellagio. We lucked out and got a killer table that had a view of the fountains. Make a reservation and request the view! Everyone there was dressed to kill! Dark restaurant, plush furnishing, fancy! Fabulous!   Service was A-ok. Knowledgable and friendly enough.   Bread basket was below par. Save calories here.   Martini was disappointing. So very unfortunate.  I took a chance and ordered the black and blue. A vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and a sprig of rosemary. The blue cheese stuffed olives were hanging out at the bottom of the beautiful martini glass. No skewers? How am I supposed to eat the olives? Wait till the end? I hated it. I requested a side of olive juice and made it a filthy martini. Still hated it. 2nd martini- "a dirty martini please". The olive juice came on the side and olives again were sadly hanging out at the bottom. So, I have to mix my own dirty? Hated it. Skip the handcrafted cocktails and play it safe with wine or champagne.   Bacon wrapped shrimp- heavenly. Wedge salad- meh- I've had better. Potato Dauphinoise- to die for. Brussel sprouts with pear- amazing!  The best part of the meal?  The 18oz bone in Rib Eye. Holy hell. Delicious. Cooked perfectly medium rare. So flavorful. Tender! Marbled to perfection.  Looking to splurge on an elegant steak dinner? I highly recommend this place. Skip the handcrafted cocktails. Share an appetizer and salad and be prepared for a premium steak dinner!

The service isn't horrible, it's NON EXISTING!  Walked in to a dead bar Saturday night with Pac-12 Tourneys happening. Order a round of three drinks from the bar. We have a seat in the bar area and I see a couple of servers walking around. Zero acknowledgment. Drinks are going down easy so I get up to get another round, and inform the friendly bar keep we will be on the patio. Ya might think she would send someone to check on us? Clearly we are thirsty. ** hint hint ** Maybe you can make some money tonight in this dead bar?! No way. We sat outside for 30 minutes.  Clearly they were not in the mood to serve customers.   HELLO! Not wanting to serve your customers?! Wake up half ass Half Moon! I paid and told the two bar tenders we would have stayed and imbibed but zero service? I'll headed over to your competition across the street. Twin Peaks. We had great service there and spent good money on drinks and bar food. The group of guys I saw leaving Half Moon had the same idea we had. Looks like they like to spend money where it's wanted too as they closed the place down with us.

I have done the research for you & happy to tell you that Sui Wok is the best Chinese food in Phoenix!   Consistent. Inexpensive. Fast delivery & damn good food!    We have dined in once but have had countless dinners & work lunch delivered over the past 3 years. I even had a party of 20 catered from Sui Wok. Every time it has been great!   Sweet & sour pork, vegetable lo mien, honey walnut prawns, & vegetable chop suey are my go to items. Egg drop soup is good as well as the sizzling rice soup. The combo dinners are enough food for three meals! Can't beat that!  I have recommended this place to a lot of people and always get a good response! Even a picky New Yorker who knows good food from China Town NYC.   Huge delivery area!! 43rd AVE- 40th ST & Northern- Buckeye.  Give Sui Wok a try!!  I guarantee you will have it again!

Super fast, friendly, and most affordable. Locked my keys in my car! $40 bucks cash add $10 if you're paying with plastic. Received receipt in email as promised, and credit card was charged accurately. Number saved- as I tend to lock my keys in my car approximately four times a year!

This place is small and awesome! Limited sushi rolls on the menu, but you can request what you like and they will happily make it! The prices are moderate and its BYOB!   There is a fridge to put your BYOB in, and you will have to get it yourself, so dont be shy!   Try a Philly Roll and add avocado! Good times!   Try this place!

We walked in and were bombarded with a horrible oder of rotting fish. I don't know why we didn't turn and walk out right that very moment.  We made it to the table, were given menus, and decided we just couldn't do it! The restaurant was busy- & I'm curious of how the smell didn't repulse the other patrons! Bad day? Always like this? I'll never know, because I'll never go back!  Oh yea, only reason we went into this place was because Pho Van was randomly closed on a Wednesday night. Disgusting smell as soon as I walk in? 0 stars!!

This place is the shizz.   Best broth in town. Extensive menu. Lots of tables and space. Ultimate hangover cure. The bowl is a huge serving! I have heard that the broth has magical healing powers. Ok, I made that up but Pho always makes me feel so good!   Clean, fast, delicious and inexpensive. Don't miss this joint!!

Just the thought of Thai E Sans Panang Curry makes my mouth water!   I am a huge fan of Panang and its my go to dish at every Thai joint I go. Thai E San does it the best! Creamy and savory with a hint of sweet.  So good!   The level of spice (1-5) is legit. I get level four and it is damn spicy! Hot! I always think "Next time I'll get level 3" but I never do because I crave the heat!   Very clean and great service. The menu offers lots of options with noodles, rice, curry, soups, seafood, and great appetizers like Thai Toast and Chicken Satay.   Definitely the best Thai food in Cen Pho!

Dear Hulas,   You and I have an amazing relationship. You have treated me so well this past year and I will stand by your side!   For those curious.. YOU GOTTA GO.  This place is awesome. Its a different concept than any other in Central Phoenix. The owner Dana is super cool and friendly, and always greets his guests and remembers the loyal ones!   The have a kick ass happy hour $5 drinks and apps. Try a specialty cocktail like the Tiki Bastard. It will knock your socks off! For an appetizer try the Hawaiian Ceviche--White fish like u have never had before, or try the Poke- tuna avocado and macadamia nuts.. its awesome. Lots to choose from and even Vegetarian friendly options.   We have tried the burgers, fish sandwich, steak tacos, fish tacos, tofu tacos grilled hapu, breakfast, wings, jerk chicken, several cocktails and its continually a quality experience.   The patio is killer when its cool out, the staff is awesome, and its a great central location. Hulas, I love you.

I've frequented Hulas for over three years now and I still love it as if it is new! Great food and drinks- awesome service. Lots of variety! Hawaiian Ceviche- grilled wings, coconut shrimp rolls, burgers, salads, black bean burger, tofu tacos, steak tacos. Those are a few of my faves! Just go. Try it. Killer Patio. Definitely one of my favorites!

This place is awesome.   Iced coffee is awesome. Service is awesome. Breakfast sandwich is awesome. Awesome location right off 7th St & Osborne.   A large drink (or what u may know as a "Grande") is gonna run you about $4-$6 so I would say average priced coffee drinks. A nice lady owns the shop and I see her often interacting with her employees and smiling. I bet she's cool.   For Bfast you can choose from egg sandwiches, a few different quiches, scones, and a daily special ( todays was french toast). I've had the Farm egg sandwich (probably 5 times) and the honey salmon salad. Both are tasty! They have beer & wine and on Sundays they offer brunch with a bloody mary or mimosa. I will try that soon & follow up.   They have a stamp card buy 10 get one free. The staff looks like hipster cool kids & that's cool. Its a cool local spot. Try it. You will go back!

Hoping that this will help some ladies.. that "dare to go bare". Won't go into details of course so read between the lines!  I feel both of my experiences at this location are not up to par as I feel the job was not done completely. Both times they "missed a spot" or two. Super painful, and it was rather quick, but I just thought that was "normal". Can not even believe I went through that-  twice!   Now I know it doesn't have to be so painful!  Which inspired this delayed review!   Urban Wax- did a much better job with a lot less pain. Read my review there.   To be fair, I did not advise this location of my concerns as I'm sure they would have been happy to make it right, however- ain't nobody got time for that! I'll take my business elsewhere from now on.

Set in the heart of Paradise Valley, El Chorro is a beautiful place that aims to impress their guests.  Classic Arizona setting with a beautiful view of Camelback mountain.  El Chorro has been our Christmas Dinner destination for the past two years. I was surprised this year when they offered the exact same menu as last. If it ain't broke, don't fix it?  The chef offers beef tenderloin, turkey dinner, or Salmon accompanied by a generous portion of sides. The beef and turkey were good. The sides were good too. Not amazing, but good. The starter salad was my favorite. Arugula, poached pear, candied walnuts and a thick slice of maytag blue cheese. They had me at blue cheese. However, the theme of the food is good. Not amazing.   Dessert however, wasn't good. I chose the Apple cobbler. The apples weren't as tender as they should have been, lack of flavor, and overall not a highlight of the meal. Service was leisurely and I didn't mind, but I could tell my company was getting antsy. Maybe I didn't mind because my excellent dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives kept me calm. Lol!  For the six of us, Christmas dinner and drinks ran about $700.00 including gratuity, which is reasonable for a place like El Chorro where I'm quite certain you pay for the ambiance.     I would like to go back for happy hour and try the famous deep fried lobster to go with the top notch martini.   I would recommend this beautiful location to take your out of state visitors!

Came here for a work team builder and we had a great time! There were 13 of us for a one hour sunset trail ride and a cowboy cook out!   The staff was friendly, knowledgable, and experienced. Made us city slickers feel comfortable and welcomed.   Our group decided on chicken and ribs for the cook out and everyone agreed it was great food.  Although nobody in the party is an experienced rider, we agreed the ride was a little slow. Giddy up pony! Let's get this show going. I imagine I know the reasons why they don't go faster, but it would have been cool to pick up the pace.   Overall, highly recommended. Great for groups!

Fire cracker shrimp- Spicy Asian Spring Roll, Pho Chay (vegetarian) & Sapporo on draft are all the reason I'll go back! Yumm!  Quite a selection of fresh spring rolls and entrees that I would like to try. Our server was a super cool friendly dude.   A little more expensive than I've paid for Pho in the past- ranges from 7-12 bucks- but it's a local spot and super fresh so I'm down to pay that. I think you should try this place :)

I am surprised this joint has 4 stars. I have been wanting to try this spot for a couple years now just hadn't got around to it. Had an invite so of course I was in!  Mediocre food, weak drinks, and weak weak customer service.  Picture it.. A rainy Sunday night, birthday dinner on the covered patio, friends looking to indulge.    Started with apps for the table. The Deviled Egg Dip needs salt and pepper, the loaded chips need more toppings, martinis need more vodka. Not sure how one makes a weak martini, but Windsor sure does. Nothing on the entree menu grabbed my attention so I ordered the corn dog bites & the fried pickle combo. They were pretty good. Everyone agreed that it was just ok food.   I'd like to suggest that the server asks if we need or want anything else before the check just comes to the table.   Do places forget that they should be trying to sell food and drinks?  Skip this joint. Glad to see that I haven't been missing anything.

I can speak from experience that Urban Wax provided a much more pleasant experience than other salons in the area. (EWC)   Amanda was fantastic with getting the job done. The best Brazilian I've had! The least painful- and complete.   Very clean and nice salon. Friendly service and cute panties after your wax.  If your looking for a new place I definitely recommend Urban Wax!

Located in D gate Terminal 4- this place was packed on a Thursday late morning. My girlfriend and I were anxious to get the party started for our girls weekend so we were lucky to snag a seat right at the bar.   I ordered the house Bloody Mary and she had a mimosa. My bloody legit tasted like chipotle in adobo! Talk about over powering. Eek! I hated it. Celine V's drink tasted "soapy" Lol. Yup. The glass still had soap residue.   Barf. We paid $26 plus tip for two shoddy drinks! Bummer. Pickings are slim for a morning cocktail in D gate terminal. I'll just wait till I board the flight  next time.

Daily Dose delivered a dose of disappointment! Customer service is weak! With so many other places in the area this alone ensures I won't be back. Add limited options for vegetarians, ( they do offer tons of sweet carbs), a waitress that doesn't know if you can substitute another side to skip on fatty meat- nor offer to find out (don't worry I can confirm that you CANT substitute any part of the menu), add mediocre food at best, and that my fellow Yelper equals 2 stars. Pass this place.

Looking for good breakfast? Add Melrose Kitchen to your list! Definitely a five star diner.  Found this spot on Yelp. Tried it, and was back the next week. Fast & super friendly service. Inexpensive and good quality food.    The biscuits and gravy are the best I have had.. (except for my moms)!  Fresh homemade biscuit and the gravy is spot on. Not too thick, not to thin. Good job Melrose Kitchen!  They offer an Iced Coffee which is legit cold coffee over ice, and it is so good.   Lots of menu options! Fried bar food, mexican dishes, burgers, sammys, kosher hot dogs.  Ill definitely be back to try lunch. Don't miss this place!!

Don't miss this show!  Not a bad seat in the house! The cast is amazingly talented and you will be entertained for the full 90 minutes.   It's loud! I do not recommend this show for young children. Lots going on and it's pretty intense. 12 and up seems like an appropriate recommendation.  The seats were comfortable and clean. The show was awesome. MJs classic hits! Worth the money. I'd like to see it again!

This place is on point! We went in on a Monday night and it was nice and quiet. The place is clean and the service is friendly.   We both had Pho- mine with shrimp and hers with chicken- the flavors were great and they provided plenty of basil, bean sprouts, and jalapeños. We shared a fresh and a crispy spring roll. The fresh didn't have mint which I thought was different, but it was delish. The crispy is seriously the best crispy Ive ever had!    I will definitely be back to try the fried rice and several other items that look good (they have a menu with pictures for everything) !  I noticed they offer delivery which is awesome. Don't miss this spot!

I hope you already know Chick Fil-A is delicious! This review is to inform you of & recommend their great catering service.   I ordered lunch for 20 people less than 24 hours prior to when needed. Online ordering was super easy. About $6.25 a person for a chicken sandwich, chips, and a cookie. Each meal was individually boxed and included napkins, a wet nap, and up to three sauces.  They offer delivery with their catering meals which is awesome (Although due to my short notice that was not an option). When I arrived at my specified time to pick up lunch, my order was ready to go! They had packed all the meals in a large reusable bag and they even helped me pack up my car! Talk about good customer service!   The food was fresh and tasted great. My team was happy with the lunch.  I will definitely be using Chick Fil-A catering again!

Strolled into this spot on a Friday night after seeing the signs for a few months. Think Chipotle, but for pizza! So damn good.  Set price @ $7.75 for an 11inch-any toppings you would like. Plenty of toppings to choose from.. Thin and crispy crust- damn it's good!! A buddy mentioned it can get busy for the lunch crowd, but it was slow on Friday night. Also thats it's best to eat there vs. Take out which makes sense! You gotta try!

I have been here several times and should have complemented these ladies long ago. I have been to several threaders in the valley and this place is by far the best. Walk in service is awesome and worth the wait on the few occasions it was busy.  I have had 2 different threaders and have been happy every time. They do a great job and can't beat the prices. They offer henna tattoos at this location but no eyes lashes. If you haven't tried threading before I recommend it over waxing. The results last longer and it just has a cleaner look. Hope you're just as happy with your experience here!

Citi on Camelback is a great place to live! I lived at this property for two years. The management staff is friendly, maintenance requests are completed very quickly, and the grounds are always clean. The property offers two swimming pools (in different locations), a decent gym, a clubhouse with a pool table, two outdoor fireplaces and gas grills. My unit was the larger one bedroom and it was a perfect bachelorette pad. Lots of natural light, enough storage, large bedroom and walk in closet, spacious bathroom, great sized patio, and a garage. The location is great. Close to great restaurants, grocery stores, and lots of things to do. When I moved out (June 2016) I had no issues and my full deposit was returned.   I've done the research and happy to tell you that Citi on Camelback is as good as it gets in Central Phoenix for the price point. Definitely check this place out if you're apartment hunting!

Not sure what's more annoying. A lame $17.00 Steak Salad or catty servers talking about another customer as I sip on a $15.00 Titos martini.   Located in terminal 4 Gate C 11-20 a catty bartender and another server were making fun of a customer who sat down with his family ordered 2 beers and 3 Pepsi's and was pissed to find out it was $32.00. Who cares? I didn't. The customer didn't make a big scene. He questioned the bartender paid his bill and left. $32 is a rip off.  The steak was cold.. The lettuce wilting.. Dressing  was nothing noteworthy. Lame. The martini was decent.   Pretty sure I hate catty servers more than a shitty salad. The salad is more likely to improve VS. the staff.   Sure wish I would have looked at the reviews 1st! What was I thinking! *tear.   Keep walking, you little Yelper you! Save your money and appetite for something worth it!

The name isn't kidding! These are the best donuts! Don't miss this place!   Open at 5am super fresh donuts and coffee.  Huge variety of donuts! All of them so delicious and pretty!   I have been several times and whom I assume to be the owners, are always so nice and friendly. They remembered me on my second visit and always thank me for my business. So sweet. Like a donut   I have called a head a couple of times for large orders for the office and they have always been ready to go and generous with a bakers dozen! They even help me load up my car.    It's a local spot and they are doing it right! Go support this great little shop!

Finally got to try this place out for a night cap and a late night snack. They are good for both!   A trendy & hip spot so be sure to look your best!   Lots of fun and different cocktails offered. A handful of late night plates including noodles and burgers and even sweet treats.  I had the Oriental Squeeze with Vodka swapped for Gin and the Lemongrass Colin's. Both had interesting flavors! I really enjoyed both drinks. We shared the Yum Yum noodles with pork belly and I have been craving them ever since!   Handcrafted cocktails aren't cheap so keep that in mind when choosing your destination.   Great service and great ambiance. I'll definitely be back.

What a cool name, right?!   Be sure to look your best! This new cocktail lounge is hip, upscale, and fun! Upstairs from Stock & Stable there are no signs advertising the bar. Our secret for now?   Crowded, we were lucky to score a corner "booth".  We were greeted with "Welcome Shots" (Free)  that tasted like Jaegermeister mixed with root beer! Nice touch! The beautiful server who is so cute and friendly was forgetful and a bit slow, but she was beautiful. Lol  Very loud music, lots of people, great lay out, we had an awesome time here!   Open now just a month, this spot is guaranteed to be a Central Phoenix hot spot, quickly! Decent prices on hand crafted cocktails, a short wine by the glass list, limited beer options, and of course a full bar.   With a friendly enough staff, perfect location, good drinks in a very loud fresh new bar, this place is a great place to party!
