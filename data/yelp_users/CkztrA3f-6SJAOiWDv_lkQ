The food here so delicious, to be quite honest the only thing I've been disappointed by is how bland their shrimp tacos are but otherwise their tacos of all different types are delicious, great nachos, chorizo quesadillas and posole. I love this place and since they got their remodel a couple months ago their beautiful shop matches the amazing food!

I love this place, by far the best spring rolls I've had in Arizona aside from homemade. Their bun bo hue and pho are always delicious; great broths, fresh veggies and perfectly cooked meats. Also, their customer service is always great, every server or counter person you pay with has a smile on their face. Me and my boyfriend come here every now and then, either to sit down or for take out and it's never a disappointment.

I've been here quite a few times over the past 2 years and I've never been let down when it comes to the delicious food and attentive customer service. I've had date nights with the bf, a birthday dinner and just girls night get togethers here and I'm sure I'll be back several times. This location is fantastic.

To start, as soon as you walk up they're charcoal grilling kalbi out front and the aroma is amazing, I ordered the kalbi don and the marinade they use was delicious. My boyfriend got their chirashi bowl which came with a fantastic variety of fish and also came with scqllops, shrimp and octopus which was a beautiful add. We also tried the black pork gyoza skewers and soft shell crab, adorable presentation and absolutely delicious. We'll definitely be coming back!

If I could give less than a star I would. I went to this location because it's right next to my work. I go in and this brown haired female employee with glasses approaches to assist. She pulls up my family plan to verify because I want to do my upgrade and she proceeds to tell me I would need to be the main person on the account. Not listening to the fact that I've reset up my plan for the edge and upgraded every phone I've had without my father there. Then the manager was asked about it, didn't bother to come speak to me himself and she further explain it's "always been like that, I'm not going to argue this", that I'm not aloud to upgrade unless my father is there. Terrible customer service.

The scenery was absolutely beautiful, the customer service was fun and had our food out in a timely manner. And for an outdoor area somehow they've managed to keep a majority of the flys and bees away, definitely a plus. Otherwise the food was fantastic, perfect portion for breakfast and all around delicious. Will definitely be back.

If you're expecting a quick stop in for a mani pedi or expect it to be quick even when you have an appointment, think again because I've waited 15+ minutes after an appointment time.  I've given this place several chances in the fact that their polish wall is great and it was conveniently 2 minutes from my place before I moved. Otherwise, the employees are always distracted, details get looked over and the wait alone is just upsetting. I'll never go back or recommend this place.

The service was great, they took me and my best friend right away for gel manicures and they had a lot of workers today even if being a Sunday which is very convenient! I didn't catch the name of my nail tech but she did a fantastic job and she was very nice. Great first experience, we'll be back!

I've been going here for quite awhile, though I've tried other places this shops prices can't be beat for the quality they give. I've never been disappointed with my manicures, pedicures or eye brows after getting them done here. The customer service is great and typically unless they're quite busy on a Friday or Saturday the wait isn't too long.

If I could I would be here every Saturday for the endless amount of beautiful quality crab, so delicious! Also of course their amazing sorbet bar in their desert section is to die for, especially the blood orange sorbet.

Customer service is awesome, best muffins I've had in a while and the Ghirardelli syrups they use for their flavored drinks puts it over the top as a beautiful touch. Great quality and great environment, not to mention it's less than a 5 minute walk from my office!

Me, my boyfriend and our friends have been here several times over the past 2 years and I've loved every visit. Their appetizers and sushi; rolls, hand rolls, sashimi etc is always delicious well worth any wait, seasonally they'll have fresh uni (sea urchin) and the staff is always very accommodating.

I went for happy hour with the boyfriend and the choice of oysters and the way they cooked their shrimp for their shrimp cocktail was fantastic. The customer service was fantastic and very attentive.

To begin, the only reason they're receiving a single star is because you can't submit with no stars. They're receiving this diminishing review because this was the most horrific nail shop experience I've ever had.  The woman who did my nails was distracted the entire time. When it came to my pedicure paint and my nails being filed, each nail was different and the paint was not cleaned up after so the polish was either lacking on the sides or was on the cuticle.  When it came to my manicure, before we sat down I had explained to her that I had gel on my nails. When we sat down, she started by trying to use basic nail polish remover and then was shocked that it was gel First example of the fact that she had no idea what was going on. From there, she attempted to rush taking off the gel, scraping it after only seconds in the foil and cotton. When it started lifting she got most of it off, key word: most. She proceeded to start cleaning my cuticles and I figured she would clean the rest of the left over polish in a few moments, which never happened. As she was cleaning my cuticles she was very distracted by a co-worker counting her tip money and cut the side of my finger, which a few days later started to become infected. After she used a cleanser on it, which took her more than an appropriate time after I had mentioned it was bleedingbleeding, but she tried to say it was residue from the gel polish she unsuccessfully cleared from my nails.  From there the bleeding stopped and she finished my nails, putting polish over the left over gel polish and I was left with specks under my polish so the coat looked terrible.  I will obviously not be going back, because after ALL of that, I ended up being over charged $5 when my card was taken while I was waiting for my nails to dry in front of an out dated fan. After a long week of work and wanting a relaxing and pampering time this three me through an awful loop. I hope it never happens to someone else.

I've been going here since I moved to AZ about 14 years ago and I've never had such incredible beef and broccoli, fried shrimp or fried rice anywhere else in Arizona. The women that have worked behind the counter for as long as I can remember are the sweetest, funniest and they always have great customer service. Which is hard to find in Metro Center, I love this place so much always 100% perfect!

To begin the decor of this shop is so relaxing and lovely. The wait time was near to nothing because they have plenty of nail techs working which is very nice, the service was so fantastic and while I was choosing my nail polish the walls of polish to look through was very impressive.  I went in for a mani pedi after receiving a devastatingly awful one the day before somewhere else. Coming here was such a breathe of fresh air. Hannah, the nail tech that I sat with was so detailed and gentle, the manicure I was left with was beautiful and flawless.  When it came to my pedicure it was one of the most relaxing experiences I've had, I love when hot stone massages are included. The packages they have are priced fair and beautiful for so much ibcluded!  I left so happy and ready for the day. I'll 100% be going back and mentioning this shop for anyone near the area.

I had come earlier in the day and they were very busy, half hour wait so I left. But I came back later in the day and the employee (Kara) checking people in was great, remembered me and luckily got me help pretty quick this time. Omar then assisted me with my new upgrade, explained my options of extra things to get with it but at the end of it I just decided to get the phone, all in all he was very helpful, good customer service.

I'm happy there's finally a great froyo place near my parent's place now, they always have a couple great flavors and their topping bar is always full of great options.

Though I've only been here a hand full of times, every time I've tried something new and I've yet to be disappointed by anything I've gotten for myself (personally I didn't like the Taro that my boyfriend got though, quite bland). By far the best milk tea I've had in Arizona. The fact that they have several different flavors of popping boba, great and quick customer service and so many incredible combinations to choose from puts them above all the boba places I've tried in Arizona. Well worth the drive.

The homemade noodles were the absolute best I've ever had, the customer service was fantastic and they brought everything out fairly quick! Only complaint is that unffortunately half the meat that came in my ramen was quite dry.

This place is so adorable and great! The customer service was so fantastic, I had mentioned I was allergic to bananas and they mixed my ice cream with new scoops on a clean surface. Me and my best friend came here to satisfy our sweet tooths and we were not disappointed! I especially loved the finishing touch of the torch roasted marshmallow on top of our deserts

This is definitely my new favorite Korean restaurant in arizona.   The service was quick, polite and so helpful. Me and my boyfriend ordered kalbi, mixed soon tofu and bossam (pork belly lettuce wraps). The broth was beautiful and Spicey for the soon tofu, packed with so much protein. The kalbi was deliciously marinated and sizzling hot when it came out. The bossam was tender and the fresh ingredients that came along were so lovely. Also, the 8 side dishes that came first were fantastic, it was my first time seeing spicey marinated squid within the options and it was amazingg.   By the end of it we were so delighted and full but it didn't stop just yet, the awesome waiter brought out a complimentary piece of cake, ahaha. We could not resist! This place was incredible and we'll definitely be back!

I loved the decor of this place as soon as I stepped in, immediately to the right of you will be a case of awesome Totoro and Doromon figures! Then everywhere you looked they have my favorite versions of the lucky cat, with the smiling eyes.  Anywho, on to the food! We ordered calamari, takoyaki, toankatsu ramen and nishikawa black.  The broth for each noodle entree were the best I've had for ramen in Arizona, the noodles how ever were just alright.  The takoyaki was delicious, though watch out because they're VERY hot in temperature with the first bite, I was a bit disappointed that they weren't more crispy on the outside but I'm impressed by a restaurant that even does this well of a job on this appetizer. The calamari however was a different story, the flavor of the calamari itself and the sauce was awfully lackluster and the breading fell off instantly when dipped, the only thing that saved it was their great spice mixture at the table and the lemon that came with it.  Overall it was a lovely experience and most of the food was quite delicious, great customer service also. We'll be back.
