I go to harkins all the time and this is the first time ive been disappointed with this theatre. Me and my friend went to go see a pre screening and we didnt get in. But thats not what im upset about. I dont get to see a movie oh well life goes on but the fact that they were taking ppl out of line from the back of the line for them to see the movie. Im sorry if your target audience is teenagers then you need to say that and not waste peoples time. Get your act together and let people know that you want teens to watch the movies and dont waste other peoples time.

I just ordered this take out tonite and thinking it was going to be amazing i was highly disappointed. The only reason i am giving one star is because the mini chimis were pretty good everything else tasted horrible. The beans tasted like they were from a can and not fresh. The guacamole was bland and also tasted like the chili in it was from a can. I would think it is suppose to be fresh veggies not instant garbage. Wasnt worth the money i spent. I will not be going back anytime soon.

Usually I would give this place 5 stars but tonight I was pretty disappointed with the service. I have gone on Friday nights when it is super busy and I still get 5 star service. Me and my friend went tonight July 15 2013 because she wanted to use her coupon for a free birthday bowl. when we arrived we waited at the front for the hostess to seat us for 10 mins then my friend just grabbed two bowls and napkins herself then we sat ourselves at a table. usually this isn't a big deal but the fact that we waited for 10 mins is ridiculous because it wasn't busy. you would think on a night that it was slow it would have been a good night to go but i guess we were wrong.   then when we tried to use my friends free bowl coupon the server told us that it had already been used even though she showed the server that she just got a email reminder that she needed to use the coupon before it expired on the 26th. I understand when you put a code in and it doesn't work but the fact that the server seemed to get a little rude with us was uncalled for. we weren't being rude to her we were just curious to why it wasn't working. and the fact that there was no onsite manager there was stupid. i just wanted to bring it to someones attention that the hostess was nowhere to be found when we tried to get a table and i'm sorry if you don't want to do your job then why are you working there when there are plenty of people out there that would be able to do you job with a smile on your face.   I just have to say i'm really disappointed with the crew that was there tonight it seemed like there were problems all night while we were there especially with the hostess. very unorganized.   so if your trying to go there on a Monday night because it's not that busy I would say don't because you will get better service on the weekends. I will not be going back there anytime soon.

I have to say i was very happy with the service this time around. They have new owners and i love the new settings inside. It is more personalized where the server actually calls your name instead of a number and it looks alot more organized and cleaner. I will be going back because im once again a fan of the service.

So i went to this location a few weeks ago and when i was just asking questions about costumes/ tshirts the guy gave me attitude and i was even joking with him to get him to laugh but he still was rude. Even checking out i just wanted to make him laugh and still nothing. I was going to let this go until tonite. I went to make a return and they close at 9. I got there at 8:57 and the doors were already locked. When he opened the door o asked if i could do a return and he was very rude and said no we are closed. I have gone to other stores at tempe market place and ive never been turned away. The only reason why i was doing a return so late was because i barely got off work. Im sorry but if ur store closes at 9 then u need to lock ur doors at 9 not 5ml mins til. And they even had one last customer in the store, its not like i was gonna go look around and shop i just wanted to return the items i didnt use. I hope this store doesnt come back next year or if they do, hire some ppl with some damn manners and some customer service experience! I understand you need to clean the store and get it ready for the next day I work retail and we sometimes have ppl inbour store til 20mins after we close be cause we are nice and understand ppl have last min shopping to do. If i get to do my return i will not return to thia store again.

So we went today and we ordered like over $30 worth the food. The guy who took our order was rude as hell! He spoke too softly and when I asked him to repeat himself he did but with an attitude. I'm sorry you have to do your job lazy ass. He didn't even give me our total and snatched the debit card out of my hand and then slammed the window. We complained to the manager and all she said was that's not acceptable. Well then do your job by teaching your employees customer service. If I could give them no stars I would but you have to rank them something so please consider my 1 star a zero. Oh and we ordered large meals and got medium. And they want $15 an hr? How bout you learn how to do your job and some customer service skills first and maybe you can talk about a raise then. Sadly to say I won't be going to this location and neither will my friends that were there with me. I will drive 5miles out of my way to the other location.

I saw that this place was super close to my house and decided to go check it out. Very nice place and excellent service. The day I got my hair cut I noticed that my layers were a little off but I have alot of hair so its hard to get everything lined up lol. But I went back the next day and he fixed my hair for me no problem. :) thanks again!

Kiera was amazing!!! Such a relaxing massage and great experience looking forward to seeing her again. She took the time to make sure to focus on where I was hurting but also helped me relax. Both Keira and Kevin are friendly and professional as well. Can't wait to go back already have my next appointment scheduled with Kevin :)
