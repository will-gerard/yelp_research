Ok... let me warn you... DO NOT BE ALARMED BY THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING. I had just moved into the area and needed a pho place to satisfy my weekly cravings. This one really did not fall short of the reviews I read. The pho was fantastic, and the spring rolls were stuffed full of delicious shrimp and veggies. The price was way less than I would expect, the whole meal was around $6 and I saved most of the spring rolls for dinner.   One thing I do wish about the spring rolls was a better sauce. The sauce they have for it is a bit syrup-y but I can deal.

I came here with some coworkers before the Cardinals game to get some food and drinks. My first impression was how hot it was inside as it seems they didn't have any air conditioning on. All the fans were going which gave it at least some air flow but all of us were sweating and fanning ourselves with the menu. We were sitting right by the door and asked if they could close it since the hot air was blowing in. They closed it, but then eventually opening the other side. Ok...  We ordered the spinach dip, volcano nachos, boneless buffalo wings, and the chicken fajitas. I could have had better food reheated from Applebee's. The food quality is very low and obviously is just reheated from a package. Not worth the money at all.   The manager on duty was apparently stressed out because at one point she was screaming at someone on her radio to get another server to the patio. All the guests were looking at her.   Understandably, it was game day, so I gave two stars in hopes it wouldn't normally be like this but I would prefer any other place around the arena to this one. Sorry jimmy buffet!

This place will be your new go-to neighborhood spot. Their grilled wings are absolutely to die for; perfectly crisp outside, juicy and tender chicken.   A whole carafe of wine is $10 so you can enjoy a low key night for pretty cheap. Try their braised spare rib ravioli... Holy heaven.

I legitimately love this bar. Great place for a meal and great place for late night...and that's tough to do!! All the appetizers are amazing (particularily the mac 'n' cheese, pretzel, and cheese curds) along with the fried chicken wrap. Thinking now about what I like there I'm realizing that everything is pretty bad for you but oh, so sinfully delicious.   Love that you can play bags and pool. Just a homey environment where you feel comfortable. Good crowd not too Scottsdale douchy.

I cannot begin to tell you how much I LOOOOVE this place. I literally go here every weekend for brunch/lunch. On Sundays the wait time for brunch can really get up there so I recommend going on an off day or later into the afternoon. This is a great spot to sip on a mimosa, enjoy brunch with friends, and see where your Saturday/Sunday will go!  Must haves: - Tacos (CHORIZO IS AMAZING, mahi mahi is good too) - Daily Dose burger (I DREAM ABOUT THIS THING... bacon, cheese, basil, chipotle aioli... combination of amazingness but beware you won't have any room to eat anything else for the rest of the day) - Shaved Turkey Melt (carmelized jalepenos and brie... need I say more???) - a healthy alternative = turkey sausage white-out. Amazing breakfast if you're looking for something on the healthy side - Breakfast nachos.... one word = HOLY CRAP. Okay, that's two but whatever. Amazing.

I had never had my eyebrows threaded (let alone waxed!) before so I was a bit nervous going in. My roommate swears by the place and her eyebrows always look perfectly groomed so I decided to give it a go.  Warning - you will definitely get addicted to getting your eyebrows threaded after your first time. They are just so... CLEAN looking. They thread, tweeze the spare hairs, and trim your eyebrows to perfection.   Overall, never a wait and quick, efficient, friendly service.

My friends and I came here as a big group for a birthday dinner. For some reason I thought this was more of a bar, but it is actually a foodie's delight! Our group was quite a handful (the drinks were flowing, therefore we were all very chatty... with everyone around us) but the server was SO nice and accommodating. None of us could decide on anything so we decided to get everything instead. My highlights...  #1: Chopped salad. Doesn't sound like much but literally THE BEST SALAD EVER. It's probably not the healthiest salad in the world, but is so so so worth it.  #2: Pan seared scallops. Perfect seared outside, nice smooth delicate inside. Delicious entree.   Overall, great bar area for mingling/happy hour and a fantastic foodie spot as well.

I had never had a spray tan before so I was really nervous. I wasn't impressed by the outside but I was over the moon by the service and quality of the spray tan I received. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to receive a spray tan. The girl was very friendly and talkative and the results were so great and natural looking.   Don't be intimidated with how dark you get afterwards the shower makes it all better. Also I was worried because I had some streaks from my pants and other things on my legs that I thought would be there with the result but it all ended up blending in.

I've been here twice so far... once for happy hour and once during regular dinner time. The happy hour was really good (the cheese bread was surprisingly DELICIOUS, better than the pizza actually) and great pricing for what you get. We checked in to get the complimentary Fireball shots which ended up being pretty smart on their part because everyone in our party continued to drink, haha.  During dinner, I had the EVO salad and the bolognese pasta. My two friends really loved the salad but it was a bit too balsamic-y for my taste. I would have liked a little bit more of another flavor to balance out. The bolognese though was fantastic (how can you mess up my favorite food though). I would definitely recommend.
