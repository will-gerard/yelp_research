Busy at lunch, but this place is awesome.  Great selection but could do better on the service and speed during lunch hour.   Dragon Eggs for appetizer was good.  I had the catfish with a 1 pepper spice level and it was awesome. Sister said it was the best fried rice she's had in a long time.   Check it out but go on off hours.

Great outdoor seating in the Arizona Center. They open at 11am and have a nice top shelf margarita selection.  You get a shaker full of drink so it's more like three drinks in one.  We all had soup and salads. It was a good lunch with  nice variety of flavors.  The chicken pablano chowder was really nice.  End of the meal comes with a little treat of white chocolate pecan in a tamale husk.  Yelp check in gets you a free dessert with entree. I didn't think the soup and salad would classify but our waitress was awesome and said she surely could do one dessert for our table of three.   Great place for lunch. Plenty of seating. Starting filling up at noon.

Clean, friendly and fast.  There are the occasional crazy people that walk in and raise hell and she was something else on the morning I visited, but that is downtown Phoenix for you.   Menus were a little sticky, the waitress was 10 years past retirement and my breakfast was delish.  IHOP never disappoints.

This place is hot. Great BBQ, not so great Peach Cobbler and I wish I would have noticed the  sign for the catfish special before ordering.  The lady at the register is quick, brash and loud. Food is out fast, serve yourself BBQ sauce and grab a seat in the red-walled dining room.  It gets a bit loud in there between the voices and the TVs but the small space is well lit by windows on all three walls, over looking Central Ave.   Try the catfish, and let me know how it is but skip the peach cobbler.

Umm..... I am glad this is a written review and you can't see my drooling as I recall our visit and take-away treats. This was my first time through the front door.  I have been to the back door to drop off ribbon for a wedding cake.  This time, we were dropping off fresh flowers for my niece's first birthday cake.   Beautiful wedding cake room for client viewing and a tasty take-away bakery case is at the register.  Prices are decent and the items are just as tasty as they are beautiful.   The cake was ready when promised and pickup was nerve-racking but easy.  The only downside to this is that my sister specifically requested that they not to use too much food coloring in the frosting. As you can see from the pictures, the baby's smash cake was completely medium blue, as well as, the top layer of the large cake.   The Cake itself was incredibly impressive.  Outstanding artistry in the details and airbrushing.  The top was chocolate and the bottom was white cake, both with a coordinating filling. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of blue staining the baby and the party guests was a huge turnoff and many people passed on having a piece.  Everything on the cake was edible (except the sunflowers).    I don't know if the design of the theme would have been as impressive if they hadn't used so much food coloring - or if they could have pulled off something just as impressive, but overall, we were happy with the outcome, and laughing at each other's stained teeth and faces.

Not the cheapest donut coffee and water I have ever had, but definitely the best cinnamon honey bun I have ever put in my face.  No joke.   I drooled every time I passed this place, the rest of the week.  If you haven't tried it, you are missing out.

Great service - good food. Love the Wor WonTon soup. Good size place that can accommodate a larger party.  Interior needs updating but good restaurant for a quick dinner or takeout.

Patio seating is great. Waiters are awesome. Food is middle of the road. It's a good place to go with it being close to my family's home.  Fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share.  Specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren't picky.  It's the go-to place for sit down mexican when we are in town.

Jamie is amazing.  He is so creative with his arrangements.  He did my sister's wedding flowers 6 years ago and my mom loved his work so much, we went back for her baby shower flowers.  We ordered one large arrangement, and two smaller, for decoration around the house for the shower.    I picked them up on Saturday and placed them in the house for the shower on Sunday.  The flowers weren't just back ground, they were works of art that smelled just as awesome as they looked and gave the room that extra pop of color and elegance in contrast to the adorable baby decor.  Guests were greeted with a light flower fragrance as they walked it and it set the tone for the whole shower.  Even the next day, walking into my sister's house, the flowers were still bright and fragrant.    Four Seasons is easy to find on the Northeast corner of 67th Ave and Cactus Rd.  They also sell silks, seasonal decor and gifts.  Great prices too. The quality for the price was a steal.

Super fast service! We don't have a Sonic near us in Michigan, but have to stop for Cherry Lime Aide when in AZ.  So good!  The food is typical greasy fast food, but good options and breakfast is available all day.

I visited Macayo's with my family on a visit in early December.  Since I don't live in town anymore, I cannot chalk up my visit to just a bad night, but I can share my experience.    We were hoping to get in for happy hour, but it was packed. Bummer, but not a strike against the restaurant.   We still wanted to stay for some drinks and dinner. We requested a table for 7. Mind you, our party was standing in front of the host stand.  Most of us are about 6' or more with the crowning jewel of height is my step father, clocking in at 7'1".  They stuck us at two tiny, pushed together tables, 7 of us, in the main walk way from the kitchen. Even if we all were at a more comfortable table, or we were smaller people, you don't put people in the walkways from the kitchen.   My sister and I were constantly getting shoved in the back, but chose to sit there so our parents weren't the ones assaulted.  I had to sit with my purse on my lap since I couldn't hang on the chair with the traffic going by and there was no floor space to spare with our tangle of legs.   I grabbed the margarita menu hoping that ordering a couple would help save the quickly falling mood.  DAMN DRINKS WERE $10+. At a bloody restaurant, during happy hour.  Oh but happy hour doesn't apply to the dining side.  A few of us ordered a drink, still.  My mom's came with just a piece of lime rind, my upgraded margarita looked like a regular and came in a smaller glass and I just got excuses from the waiter that they are the same ounces. (Bullshit and we pointed it out with the empties after the fact but he didn't care.)  I was still charged the $12.50 for the shorted drink. The food was ok but not much of a selection.  I shared a meal with my sister to off set the cost of our drinks.   It was very disappointing and my mom was crushed that the only evening we had to visit a Mexican restaurant, during my visit to Arizona, was such crap.

Mom and I hit this place for the tail end of happy hour.  Great choices of happy hour items and beverages.  We pigged out on sushi and appetizers. I had never had real wasabi before and it was served with my sashimi order.    The tempura was good and greasy. Typical selection. Looks like an ok place for quick affordable sushi options.

Visiting family, we had a sitting with a new baby.  The photographer was excellent and patient.  The studio was cool (temperature wise), clean and professional.  You review your proofs in minutes and pick up picture the same day.  I ordered a collage and the photographer ran down all the packages, combos, and discounts based on what we were looking for so it was easy to figure out what to get, than trying to calculate which was the best deal in our heads.  I wish I could recall her name.    My sister has a membership and it seems like a beneficial program if you have a growing family and need professional pictures done throughout the coming years.   Highly recommended *but go early and plan ahead if taking a small one. Earlier appointments, you tend to have the place to yourself.

Darn goods sushi lunch spot. Great service and quality sushi.  Small menu but adequate for what we wanted.  Not the easiest to find in the strip mall but worth the hunt.  Poke Salad is huge and was a special, not on the menu.   Service was excellent, though a little too conversational. Looking forward to our next visit.

Happy hour after 9pm with 99 cent margaritas and half off appetizers is what brought us in to this restaurant after Glendale Glitters.  Waiter was an ass but warmed up to us after a bit.   The flaming queso dip was again; not real cheese.  What is it with restaurant trying to pass off processed cheese food with spice and call it queso.  I would much rather pay more for the good stuff than order something like this crap.    The rest of the meals and dishes were great.  Pretty over priced for what we got, but it was tasty.

My oh My the pie!!!  Stop in, stretch your legs from your long car ride up or down I17.  Walk the dog, grab some lunch and don't forget the pie!  Menu has a great selection of American fare.  I think they are particularly talented with the catfish plate and I have heard praises of their chicken from my teenagers. As we enjoyed our lunch, we discussed the delights of all the different pies available.  Arguing which pie is better between bites, watching the kitchen take pies between the bake shop to the back for boxing.    Coconut cream is a popular favorite. The blueberry crumb came in a close second.  I think there are close to 20 different selections on any given day.  Even if you aren't hungry, stop in a buy a whole pie or two. It's worth it.   We visited in the off season, however, the attached bar is a hot stop for motorcyclists too.  It can get loud and the wait can be long but well worth it.

The best gas station and convienence store I have ever seen.  More than a convienence store; this QT is an indulgence stop.  Hot fresh pretzels to order, fast service, 50 different icy or smoothie flavors, tea station, and any snack you think your stomach can handle.    This place is crazy. I wish they were in Michigan.

They don't honor the 15% coupons on the bag of cookies, even though it does not say 'only valid on return visit'. We won't be back, no Sweet Tomatoes in Michigan. Wouldn't have bought the cookies either, had we known.

Best wings EVER!!!  Ask for extra crispy medium wings, and the pizza well done.  The Italian sausage is salty but the veggies are fresh.  The fried raviolis are just two and are HUGE.  Not what I have in mind when thinking of fried raviolis.  Family side is great for kids and large groups.  Barside is fun and spacious enough.  I have to visit when in town just to pig out on the wings.    So good!

Run down little chinese place that hadn't been to in almost 15 years but I was really excited to find that their GARLIC CHICKEN LUNCH SPECIAL HASN'T CHANGED.    If you were part of the hoards that used to try to cram in at Yin's in the late 90's and remember that deliciously spicy garlic sauce, they are still there.  Check it out.  Cheap as all the others, but this dish they corner the market.

Man!  Every visit to Arizona, I have to visit this place for a breakfast burrito.  Oh Humberto, how I miss you!!  the hot sauce has not flavor to interfer with the fabulous burrito, but it sure brings the heat, and brings out the flavor of the meal itself.  This truly is a most excellent hole-in-the-wall.  Highly recommend Sausage Egg and Cheese burrito, with three doses of hot sauce.  yummmm

Ok, all done with Red Lobster for a good long while now.   Cheddar Bay biscuits no longer has the pull they once did, after this visit.   The 7 of us walked in on a Monday night and we were seated quickly. Host was friendly, waiter Jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles.  What wasn't nice was the off-duty employee hanging out at the hostess station, getting employees to sign a card, while texting on her phone - totally oblivious to guests waiting to get to the hostess stand or that she was being loud and inappropriate. She looked like she was dressed for bed and hanging out at home, rather than a restaurant. I am surprised the manager didn't correct the spectacle.    Mr. Jeremy seemed like he was fast, as he raced around the room, but we waited a long time for drinks, food and refills.  It was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant.  The Mojitos from the bar were really good though.  I used to love the mussels appetizer, but this visit they were awful.  I had the 4-course special. It had all I wanted.... if it was edible.  The shrimp skewer was still a bit raw.  The coconut shrimp was ok.  The rice under the uncooked shrimp wasn't cooked either, so I am glad I asked for a potato and they still gave me the rice.  I told Mr. Jeremy that the rice wasn't cooked and he was on to something else before I could tell him about the uncooked shrimp too.  With the larger party, I didn't want to make a fuss and I couldn't seem to get his attention without on. The caramel cheesecake dessert was tiny and looked like the swirled cheesecake you get from GFS or Sam's club. Eh.  My husband's steak was cooked nicely. Bill was still $80 for the two of us.   I think we'll spend that $80 elsewhere next time, so we can both eat our meals.

This place is great! At 35th and ThunderChicken, look for the Whataburger west of I17; Deer Valley Lanes is tucked back behind the fast food joints on the north side of Thunderbird. Nice clean building, facilities, bar and small kitchen with a small menu but good selection. Huge selection of house balls to fit everyone. 32 lanes with updated tv screen score boards. The bowling is super affordable and you won't find better for these prices. $8.89 after 8pm Mondays, unlimited bowling. Come practice or let off some steam. I don't see a pro shop but I could be wrong.   Great play for family fun.

This is as good as it gets - for cheap, fast, fresh and awesome Mexican food.  I always have to stop at this location for a breakfast burrito with no less than 5 cups of hot sauce and a horchata.  The burrito is enough to eat on for the whole day, but the horchata is gone too quickly.  The early morning staff are always friendly guys just waiting for an order.  I think they are a little tickled to see me (a tall non-Latin lady in business clothes) ordering a honking burrito with tons of hot sauce.    So good.  So cheap.  I miss you Polibertos.  I want to open one in my area.

Food is the same.  Prices are the same.  What this place has that most don't are the people.  The staff always make the difference and the young man that was at the register was soft spoken but patient and smiling.   Glad to stop in at an LJS and not regret it, for once.

Surprisingly, the only place we found that had Karaoke on a Saturday night.  Karaoke used to be on every corner but I guess not anymore.   We found Enoch's had a KJ come on at 9pm and headed over. Ordered a pitcher of beer and watched the football games. Beer was good and cold in the frosted glasses but after my sister complained that her beer was awful, did we discover that he glass was coated with not frosting but what smelled like vomit!  The bartender said that it was probably tomato juice as a lot of people have been ordering beer and tomato juice lately, but it definitely wasn't.  They gave her a fresh glass and fill, but it just ruined the night.  I sang one song and we bounced.   never again.

Gabbi was busy but didn't get flustered at the huge line that almost went out the door. She handled me and my three boxes of stuff, quick as a flash and got us out the door. Emailing labels for collect on account shipment was easy. Very impressed with service and ease of shipping, especially with hiw busy for noon in a Monday, they turned out to be.

Where else can you sit outside for a nice lunch, guaranteed shade, full bar, and feel like you're back in Germany - Haus Murphy's.  We were greeted by a nice German lady who warned us of a couple of sweat bees that were wanting a taste a beer but weren't interested in the people.   No bother.  They left us alone.  Lunch was great!  I had a daily special sandwich that was hackbraten on grilled rye bread.  I can't remember what it was called.  My hubs is a sucker for Sauerbraten.  Also ordered a plate of potato pancakes.    Best pancakes we have found, ever.   My mom and step dad aren't impressed with this place as they used to be and they live in the area but I had to see for myself.  It's too bad their experiences aren't what we had.  We loved it.  Also tried the new Schoffhofer grapefruit beer.  I am on the hunt for this stuff now.  It's so good!   I handed my hubs the keys and ordered another.  Too bad we cannot get the beer here in Michigan.  The bill was a little hefty but we weren't watching it and it was worth the wonderful afternoon of leisurely lunching with the old folks on a weekday afternoon.   There isn't a large selection of German restaurants in the Valley but you don't need anymore more when you have Haus Murphy in downtown Glendale.

Glendale Glitters has blown up since I was last there 16 years ago.  It was a mad house of people, cars, stroller and pets.    I do wish people wouldn't subject their dogs and pets to a crush of people like that.  Even some children were getting overwhelmed.  But the venue was great and well planned.  My favorite discovery was Hey Joe! food truck. Check them out!  good stuff.

Smaller store than most in the Glendale area, but it was clean with a good layout.  We stopped in for a few items before Thanksgiving and it was a madhouse, as expected, but the reason for the two stars was more than that.   My sister caught her eye on a patio set this store had on sale.  She pulled the tag, took it to the front and paid.  As she swiped her card, I realized that she was charged $50 too much.  When pointing it out to the cashier, she couldn't tell which dollar amount was the discount and which the credit card was actually charged.  Either way, it was wrong. The cashier didn't know how to deal with it so she sent us to Customer Service so they could fix the price and pull the patio set.   The customer service guy was super nice and gave her an extra $5 for her trouble, in the refund of the difference and called to have the set brought up.  It was 30 minutes of awaiting, checking with three different people, three different times to find out what was taking so long - only to find out that they didn't have a boxed set, only the floor display.  My SISTER has to ask if they would call another store to find if they have a boxed set available.  (I thought they would have offered or done it already with how long we were waiting)  Another 30 minutes later, they refunded the entire purchase, and set her on to the next store that had a set waiting.    Sheesh!  It shouldn't be so difficult to figure out if something is in stock and if not, who else would have it.  It seemed that whenever we asked someone if someone was bringing the set around - no one knew what was going on or who was working on it until someone in a tie jumped up and went back there himself.   At the second Fry's, with the boxed patio set, of course the price was higher and my sister had to argue with the second store to please call the first one to get it settled.   It was finally settled and she ended up with her set, for the displayed price, but took almost two hours.

Lunch stop during the week, after Mani pedis next door.  Sushi bar meets sports bar!  Great lunch special selections but the selection of beers was equally as impressive.  TV screens abound, so to have a view from every seat.  The waitress was very knowledgeable as to the roll descriptions.  The pictures on the back wall, of all the celebrities and sports icons, were fun to peruse. I bet this place is hopping at night, being just south of the Arrowhead baseball compound and training center.   My mom and I each chose a combo and shared an edamame appetizer.  Service was swift.  Food was fresh.  Glad to have found good sushi spot in the area.

It's kitchy overpriced breakfast spot.  Limited menu, bad service and small portions.  Mom wanted to take us there as something special for Sunday morning.   We ate and thankfully weren't riding together, so we stopped about 3 miles down the road to get something else to eat as we were still hungry.    Staff couldn't keep the coffee carafes full.  Patrons brought their dogs, who didn't like the other dogs so our breakfast time was spent with a ton of barking back and forth.   Self serve beverage is great, if it's free - which it is not and for the prices, should be.   The facilities were upgraded port-o-potties.  At least there was running water and electricity, right.  This place could be so much better.   Oh and PS - staff needs to make a sweep of the grounds/dining area. Huge dead and squashed bugs (yes plural) on the patio blocks in not appetizing and probably bad for all the dogs that visit too.

I stopped in on a Saturday night, and sat at the sushi bar.  Very popular place and I see why. Extensive roll menu, with a roll paired to all 50 states, with pictures.  I don't recall the state, however, the fried tempura salmon that came on top of my roll was unique and made the roll.  I also order the crispy fried shrimp that came in some sweet spicy sauce.  Hand dipped and huge.  De-vein and large portion for $15.    You can't get a better combination of quality and price.  I am glad this restaurant survived.  I have seen it for many years, but this was my first visit.    Check out their happy hour. I will on my trip to the valley.

Hot breakfast spot, just west of 51stAve on Olive. Be prepared to wait on the weekends, they are busy. Huge portions, great omelette selection and the wait staff really hustles. Coffee is always fresh and great for families or groups. Weekday mornings are the slowest.

You can check stock online before heading to the store.  This helps a lot, especially when looking for a hard to find liquor like Damiana.  Since not sold in Michigan, I tracked down the last bottle on my side of town before leaving.  I walked in, early in the morning and a employee was easy to find and eager to help.  I was in and out in 10 minutes - that included my quick check down the Malbec aisle for anything that stuck out at me.    Cashier looked up my membership and I was out the door.  Great visit.

I have a love/hate with Pappadeaux. Their prices are high, the selection is great but not so great.  $20 for a catfish plate is exorbitant; however, what they do, they do it well.  The catfish was perfect, especially with a side of grits and bottle of Louisiana hot sauce.  The platters are huge and enough for two people to share. Not much in the way of non-seafood options - which made it hard for my family members that don't eat seafood to find something. That menu needs to be expanded to more than $40 steaks.    The Mediterranean Calamari appetizer is $20 and the best app on the menu - however, it's a huge plate for a large table.  I wish had a smaller option.  Only 2 people at our table would eat such a thing but no way could we tackle such a huge plate and calamari isn't something you can take home for later.   This restaurant has the best patio in the valley.  Open air, fans and misters, lots of greenery and shade.  I could spend forever on Pappadeaux's patio.   Our waiter was excellent, though the food took a long time. I think it was the stinking steak being cooked.   *So here is your take-way: Only come with seafood lovers (the rest will be uncomfortable), sit on the patio, have plenty of time to hang out, and be prepared for a high bill - but you won't be disappointed by the food or the atmosphere.

Margarita flight is good but mango margaritas are the best.  Stopped in for a drink and the bartender has just made a flight for display.  Perfect for sharing on Valentine's Day.  Bartender didn't keep hounding us and we sat in the little bar area watching people and the fountains.   Great spot!  I will definitely make a point to go there again for the mango margarita.  It was that light, refreshing and easy to drink.

Love this store! This was my first visit. Extensive selection - though of course they didn't have what I was looking for. Young man helped me and was eager to look up my selections to see if they could get what they weren't carrying. No luck but still a great store.   I wish they were nationwide.

Short drive to get out of nature and take a hike.  They have reasonable horseback riding hours and fees. Areas for picnics, camping and trail rides.   If you hike, make sure you check your shoes before going home and leaving cactus burrs all over your sister's shag carpet.  Sorry Lauren.

Visited the Valley again in late November and had to stop in at Lee Lee's.  They have definitely cleaned up!  You still smell fresh fish, but aren't covering your face for the stench.   The European section might as well be taken out totally. It's awful.  If you want any Asia cuisine ingredient, this is the place to go.    Bummed they don't have a German selection or much of a Dutch selection anymore but glad to see they cleaned up.    Great place for inspiration and exploration.

Visited in early December.  We beat cover and got a great table.  They absolutely rake you on food and drinks.  We planned our visit with every intention of eating dinner and drinking there all night, but no go.  I asked about bottle service for our table to avoid having to try to communicate with the waitress when the place started to get loud.  She didn't know nor was she interested in find out for us.  Ich.  Drinks and food were concert venue or amusement park prices.   The Piano players were constantly asking for suggestions but throw your request on the floor if it doesn't come with a tip.  Would be much easier to have some little sign or primer of 'how things work'.    The premise is fun and the guys were really entertaining, but that's it. There is no such thing as comfortable seating in a place like this, and be prepared for the guys on stage to single you out if you catch their attention.  And they won't be nice.

If you know food & wine, and if it's not spot on the experience is ruined, then don't go here.     Best have a reservation. Long wait for the bar even.  Thankfully we did have a res and a booth, as requested in the reservation.  Nice a la carte selections but the wine list was seriously lacking.  Lots of blends and over priced bottles but nothing that struck our fancy.  I settled on a Toso Malbec that was nice.  We both order starters, steaks and sides.   I sent back the lobster bisque. It tasted like starchy baby food.  Worse ever and at $14 for a little cup of it, it was surely going back.  Steaks were cooked perfectly but were unremarkable. The 'generous portion of king crab' atop my steak was a joke for the $14 additional price tag.  It was good but laughable after I specifically asked the waitress about the portion. I really wanted crab with my steak. It was just one bite worth of crab.    We enjoyed the wine, steaks and the Fleming's potatoes.  The bill was about $250 with tip and the waitress brought a box of truffles as a thank you for dining with them on Valentine's Day.   This is supposed to be a high-end steak house and we just didn't get it.  We've had so much better overall elsewhere.  I really wanted to like it but it feel short. I see where they pay attention to detail, push desserts and try to make you feel special but the food quality just wasn't there.

Best Greek and Mediterranean food I have found in Arizona so far.  Sis and her hubs love this place, so we had to try it before leaving.  Falafel is fresh and real!  Prices are very reasonable.  My only bad note would be the garlic sauce. It's not garlic sauce.  It might be garlicy pink runny tarter sauce.  It's not true garlic sauce I was craving it.  But oh well.  the sandwiches, and falafel was excellent.  The staff was so friendly and I commiserated with the counter gal over our purple hair highlights.  It looked like they were really busy too. Thankfully we caught the end of the rush and could get a seat.   I see why they are so popular. Really great place.

We decdied to try out Frontier, as it was the cheapest fare (w/ layover) to Vegas and from PHX for the holiday.  I was super surprised at the leg and hip room you get on these planes.  There are TVs in the headrests (for purchase of course), free earbuds, and bev service and good snacks to purchase available.   Fastest beverage service I have ever had, but the best part was the trip home. Frontier terminals aren't too crowded. The layover at the Denver airport was perfect (walked across the aisle of the terminal to our next gate) and asked for upgrade to exit row for the second leg, if they were available.  They usually cost and extra $40 for the added leg room, but the lady saw that we were pretty tall (I'm 5'10") and I asked nicely. Hell my 7' step father could fit in the exit row!  TVs are free for the planes with the busted units or really short flights. Just depends.  Checking a bag was only $20. We will definitely use them again if their prices stay that competitive.

Dressy hipster spot. Great food and good wine selection.  $5 wine by the glass until 5pm - every day.  Bruschetta is unmatched.  Huge portion so don't let the price deter you.  This is a place for tidbits, small meals, salads and wine. You will be satisfied but it will be costly.    Only downside is the service. It's 50/50 if you get a smile from the Postino staff or an eye roll if asking a question about food or wine. They are slow slow slow.  Refills are not given, you have to ask for them.  Thankfully, the hostess seemed bored and was filling water glasses.  I'd say this place lost 2 glasses of wine from me for being so slow and inattentive.     Food is worth the staff issues.  They are catty hispter jerks.  If you don't mind and can deal with that, check them out.

Visit was 02/10/15  Service was much improved on this visit.  Food is still fantastic as before.  Bruchetta boards are unmatched, anywhere.  I make this a must-stop with my mom when I am in town, now.  They have specials each day, so check the website.  Great place to relax, nosh and socialize.    The atmosphere and decor is open yet shaded.  Great wine, and beer list.  I am not sure if they have cocktails, but I cannot say I care, as I always look forward to the wine.    Very trendy and fun place for 21+.

Cheaper than Whole Foods but great selection of whole food products.  Lots of bulk and raw, healthier options and they don't seem to carry junk.   I always wind up here when travelling because I inventively forgot something.  I wish Sprout was also in Michigan. I love this place.

Drive thru coffee chain with personal service, friendly smiles and good coffee!  Affordable, fast and fresh. I really liked hitting Dutch Bros whenever I could, during my stint in the Valley.   They made the perfect iced coffee.  Not too sweet, but just perfect.

Real Korean food! Finally. I have had a craving all week and just as I am heading to the airport, I checked Yelp on last time and boom! Just around a mile from where I was staying, I find this little gem.  Small nicely decorated dining area but a little hard to find.  Don't let the outside fool you.  The inside is really nice.      Tucked into the northwest corner strip mall at 43rd and Olive; there appears to be a small collection of little south Asian restaurants.  The store front windows are covered in newspaper or some kind of board in the windows, to defuse the direct assault of the afternoon sun.  I was surprised to find this happy little Korean cafe for lunch stop on my way to the airport.  109 degrees outside, nice dark and cool inside.   The prices were normal for Korean BBQ and the menu had everything I craved. It was hard not to try the Seafood pancake, spicy rice cakes and an entree. I wanted to make it quick and kept myself from ordering more than one item.  I am sure the others on the plane would not have appreciated the smell from leftover seafood pancake.   I ordered Duk Mando Guk - Dumpling and rice cake soup.  Huge bowl of tasty rice cakes and dumplings in a light broth with dropped egg, green onion and pieces of carrot.   This restaurant is not a steakhouse or BBQ grill house - the difference is rice cake.  The Korean restaurant that wants to be considered more upscale will not have rice cake in any dish on their menu.  It is considered street food (like french fires) and not worthy.    I love rice cakes.  Spicy rice cakes, rice cake soup, hot pots with rice cakes -  Service was good. Not too crowded. The soup was perfect, as well as, the banchan that can with it.  I was in and out in 45 minutes.

This place got a lot of good reviews.  My last day in town and I needed a mani pedi before heading home.  It was a Friday afternoon about 4pm.  I arrived just ahead of the rush.  The girl that I had must have been newer.  She was sweet and took her time to get it right but I didn't mind the slowness.  She did a good job. Nothing fancy, just a mani buff and pink toes.  As I watched people come in, the other workers were gruff and seemed annoyed but perhaps it was because they knew what they were in for, as the group of customers immediately started complaining about prices and taking over the place.   Haggling wasn't necessary, as the prices are better than reasonable and were posted.  The owner or manager greeted me with a big smile and swapped out my hot water bottle from the car, with a fresh icy one from the back, which showed great customer service.    From the reviews and my experience on this visit; they treat you as a good customer straight-away and will give you good service if you don't try to take advantage of them.  Asking price is one thing, complaining about an extra charge for extra service requested is another.   Service is great.  Only note of improvement would be for the guys not to hangout, out front, smoking and talking on their cell phones.  It gives the place a sketchy feel and they might get better customers if someone isn't haunting around outside.  No woman willing to pay a good price, wants some older man, wreaking of cigarettes to be working on their nails. That is what I expected to be confronted with when walking in but was prepared to speak up if so.  I know the women in my family would just avoid the place and find somewhere else to go.

NE corner of 59th and Olive - tucked in the corner, Shako Mako has a nice little dining room and outdoor patio. They make everything fresh so if you are in a hurry, call ahead. Take out order took 20 minutes. Food was excellent and a great value.   They are not visible from the road.  Pull in behind McDonald's and Jack N the Box and you will find Shako Mako tucked away in the corner of the complex, though you cannot miss them, with the great pictures of their plates.

Very friendly but the not all employees should be doing manicures. My visit was for a simple manicure and I got an older lady that spoke no English. She did a poor job filing, shaping, clipping and painting. I got home and had to clip off the shreds of nail from her horrible filing job. They need more and newer polishes. Not good colors selection. The two I did pick, she kept adding thinner. My polish has bubbles and rough edges. Sloppy color left in skin too. Super cheap service but not worth it. Tools came out of a general box and not sterilization packet.   Going elsewhere tomorrow for a color change. Ridiculous.

My mom and sister's fav nail spot.  We stopped in for services before the weekend activities. They clean and sterilize tools, clearly.  Happy to see it and watch them pull the items out of the plastic and not have to wonder.  They take their time and listen to the customer.  They also have bottled water to offer and take appointments.  Reasonable prices too.  I don't get anything special, so I cannot comment on their work but I liked my buff mani pedi.  Will definitely keep this on my list for when I visit PHX again.

Love that they have a great concession stand. Most drive in concessions suck.  This one doesn't. Pretty dead for a Thursday night but that is what we wanted.  Just to get out of the house.  Bring a radio. Catch a double feature.  Stop at the bathroom before you park or the walk could be pretty far when you really have to go.   Only downside was that we faced our screen, right at the point of a driveway to trailer park.  Every car coming out had headlights right in our faces.  It would benefit the drive-in and patrons to add a tree or shrub there.

This place is a fav now.  This was our first visit and last outing during my most recent visit to AZ.  My sister and I like the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix, for lunch and shopping.  The chalkboard advertising Sangria for happy hour really caught our eye.  It's HAPPY HOUR!!    Great selection of appetizers (Opa...tizers  hehehe) for $4.  Red and white sangria made to order and other drink specials.  The service was super friendly and welcoming.  I can't believe there was no one there on a Friday at 4:30pm during happy hour.  This place is a gem!   The Saganki was great, the service was great, the drinks were the best. Check them out.

Yes yes - I am one of the hoards of people singing the praises and talents of Chef at Le Napoleon.  Here is my story:  My mother and I planned a baby shower for my sister. It was to be LEGENDARY... and it was, of course.  We had to have the best.  Which we did think was Karl's Bakery.  Since their place has been under construction we were referred to La Napoleon.  I never thought about Macaroons for a baby shower and wholly epiphany!  Such beautiful colors and flavors.  Mom tracked the place down and had a sampling.  We were sold.  Ordered 52 pieces of macaroons, mini tortes and chocolate cream puffs.  The shower was this weekend and it was a huge hit!  The location is hard to find but worth the search.  Don't give up!    On my visit, it was a Saturday afternoon and was surprised the pastry case was empty. No macaroons, only a few items.  I picked a little treat and was happy.  The price was reasonable, especially for the quality.  Though if I were to do it again, I would only get macaroons and not the tarts and puffs.  They don't keep well overnight.  Got a little soggy.  Still really good though.

Have you tried Filipino Street food?  I hadn't either but I have a feeling these guys know what they are doing because I am addicted now.  No joke. Small menu choice, and they take their time, but food is hot, fresh and so good!  Did I mention it's tasty?

Three of us getting pedicures took 2 hours, because there was only one gal working on all three of us.  They aren't very well staffed for during week day hours.  Very nice staff and good work.  Clean place and tools. They don't charge extra for a buff, which I appreciate because those tiny buff pads don't cost more than the cost of the OPI polish they put on you and a lot of places will charge you an extra $5.   Call ahead, make an appointment to make sure you have attendants available to get you done, otherwise, you could be waiting a long time.

Great yogurt shop tucked into the strip mall by Barro's.  Have some pizza and visit yogurtini for dessert.  Try all the flavors if you like, then fill your cup and head over to the toppings. Oh my the toppings.  Fresh fruit and bobas, nuts, candy, syrups and cookies are all available.  You pay by weight and it can add up quickly, so be conservative. You really don't need that much anyway.   The store was clean, and bright. Staff was friendly.

Very cute breakfast\lunch spot.  A little over priced but there is something for everyone here.  Lots of great seating, food options, salad bar, sandwich bar and   barista corner.  I ordered a Sumatran chemex and a bagel & lox.  Super friendly and fast service. Manager was always present, approachable and helping out on the floor, engaging customers.   Small specialty food items in the grocery section.  This is an ideal place to pack up for a gourmet picnic, desk lunch or quick bite.

Wow. Fast is an understatement.  Two cashiers, two terminals, handling two customers at once - one on each side.  This is their business model - awesome!  Step up to a terminal by the donuts and order a fresh hot pretzel - done in two mintues  I have seen elaborate coffee stations but I was in love when I saw their elaborate TEA station.  SWEET!  My favorite.  Hot tea, iced tea, flavored tea, brewed tea, boxed jarred and sunned tea.    I think I will quit my professional job and work at a QT if they ever come to Michigan.  :)

Grungy little drive thru, but I have to make this a stop every time I am in Phoenix. Their breakfast burritos with hot sauce - it's what I crave.

It's good food (what the rest of my party had) and great service, but my entree fell short. It wasn't bad just unremarkable. I mark a good Mexican restaurant by how well they make their chile rellenos - this one had the seeds still in it. Which shows lack of attention to details in prep and just ruins the chile. It was flavorless and I pushed it aside. Super attentive servers.  Fast refills. Really good prices for food and drinks, including Margaritas.

Moonshine cocktails are perfect for cooling off after spicy mac, buffalo chips or southwest burger. Love the cherry limeade moonshine drink.    This place is to the left of spicy, so cowboy beware!  It sure could light your campfire if you get too adventurous with the spice level, but oh it's so good!   We visited for my sister's birthday and it was their daughter's first trip out of the house, at 6 days old.  The restaurant was slow, for a Wednesday night, so our food was hot, fresh and fast.  Sis had a birthday coupon for joining their club and it was quite generous at $25 off your meal, no minimum!  (just not on alcohol)  Great place. Glad we went.

I don't know about you, but I like a cozy booth at breakfast time.  They had none at this place.  That is about the only thing I can think of that would have made this place better.   The food is great, the service was bright, attentive and quick. The prices weren't the cheapest but not too bad and worth the quality, for sure.   Mom thinks they ruined their gravy with the abundance of fennel seed, but I didn't mind it.  Thought it was good.  Biscuit was lost under the gravy, so they weren't stingy.  Mom loves the Joe's scramble.  Huge pile of food.  Enough to share.   We will be back.

Menu is extensive, self serve salsa bar. Really clean.  If you have questions be patient while the cashier gets the manager that speaks English.  He's super friendly and will make whatever you want.    Oh how I love a good machaca breakfast burrito and horchata.  I told him to hold the cheese and veg it up.  It was huge and perfection.    Yumm.

I have never come across a shop like this.  Nestled in the strip mall, next to Ollie's at 51st and Olive.  You walk in to an old time candy shop, order your flatbread tacos at the window and grab a table.  All the tables have comfortable chairs and dining room is clean with TVs.   The flatbreads are huge. I didn't have one, just watched my guys try to eat one each and they failed. The food here to too heavy for me but they really like the novelty of it and were happily filled for a day a quad riding in the desert.  We had to visit again before we left the valley - they liked them enough then.   I will have to try a sweet flatbread option sometime. They were calling to me from the menu.  If you go, let me know what you think.

This place sucks.  It's small, and their advertisements all over TV are BS.  They don't have any regular keno machines.  Payouts on the machine games are crap.  Only thing they have going for them is the location.  I was super excited to be able to hit a casino 30 minutes from Glendale instead of having to go out to Casino Arizona or Fort McDowell.    Won't make that mistake again.

I have never dared dream of such a place, let alone hear of this becoming a new tread.  MADE TO ORDER DONUTS WITH CUSTOM TOPPINGS.    Boy am I glad that my husband wanted donuts that morning, on our way up I17.  We saw the sign for Desert Donuts and took the exit.   Friendly welcoming and quick explanation, 5 mins and we were out the door with a box of fresh cake donuts with custom toppings. FANTASTIC!  I am glad we were just visiting though - or I would be here getting donuts for every office birthday, school function, or whatever reason I could come up with to get Desert Donuts.  They aren't cheap but they are affordable and worth it!  Located in the strip mall, a couple doors down from Albertson's. - which is handy if you need a nearby restroom.

Stopped in to find a specific herb for my sis.  Whole foods was the only ones that carried fenugreeek and thankfully, we were in that area.  Found someone to help us straight away, as the vitamin and supplement area is extensive, but had to push through a line of people waiting to see Fabio, who was scheduled to make an appearance for his new drink mix.   It was horrible of me but I giggled my way out of the store, asking my mom if she was sure that she didn't want to stay for Fabio.   Whole foods is a little high priced but consistent and trustworthy.

Oh Karl's!  Your daughter is awesome. The Baker's Daughter runs the place now, at their new location on Central just south of Dunlap.  Excellent and efficient flow of addressing customers.  The in-door puts you in line at the counter, you make your way down the case, choosing your items and pay at the end, exiting a second door.  I got way too much but all my favorites, since I was visiting.  small fruit torte, almond horns, cream puffs, streudel, and had to try a kronut.  I have had one before, just not from Karl's and now I see why for the stellar kronut reputation.  Lemon Basil kronut is amazing!  There are other flavors but this was the one I tried.    True European bakery, and I make a point to stop in when in town.

I helped my sister setup for her daughter's first birthday. First stop, the day before the party, was to White Knight Party Rentals to pickup the bounce house, kids' table, and mini chairs.  Not the easiest place to find but the building is setup to make it easy to pull around back and have your items loaded by the staff there. The guys fit it all in the back the SUV, and gave us great tips on how to fold it up when we are ready to return it.   They were very friendly and easy to work with for pickup and drop off.  Next time, we feel like it would have been worth it to pay the $60 delivery charge for setup and tear down, if your order doesn't meet the minimum. If your order is big enough, delivery, setup, and tear down is included. Even the small bounce house was very large and cumbersome for us. We did it just fine though, thanks to their easy tips on how to fold it back up.     Highly recommended. It was a great experience. We will definitely use them again.

I love love love their white pizza!! It's so good!  The chicken wings are the best around. Pulano's used to hold that title for me but something happened and Barro's stole the spotlight.  My brother in law loves when I come to town because I always want to go get pizza and wings.  There just aren't any good places here in this Michigan area.    Barro's wings are crispy with a great sauce.  The pizza was fresh and good quality cheese and meats. (I added sausage)  Love this place!
