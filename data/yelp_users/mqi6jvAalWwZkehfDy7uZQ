Upon strolling into "LGO" I immediately became confused. This isn't your average wait to be seated, main dining area, server brings you food type of place. At least not in the mornings. Shame on me for expecting that. My comfort zone needs to expand.   As soon as I figured out the ordering process and just how this place operates, it was easy to fall in love... With the food. I have been fortunate enough in my quarter century to dive into the pizza Arizona has to offer. I had no idea LGO offered pizza. It doesn't fit with their hipster market persona you feel in this area of town. I caught a glimpse of a couple of their pizzas as I did my customary 'I'm gonna walk around, and look at people's food so I can make up my mind without making people feel uncomfortable' and ordered "the gladiator" pizza which easily feeds 2 people. Wow. The sweet crispy chewy crust is outstanding and easily rockets to the top 5 of pizza in this town. I also tried their cheese burger on their homemade english muffin. Another fantastic item on their menu.   There is a hectic feel to this place as you scramble from the main counter to finding a seat, and picking up your order from different parts of the market but it all seems to work. I plan on trying their sandwiches next. They looked great as I was creeping on other peoples food.

Orange Table is one of the best spots for breakfast and lunch in Scottsdale. The omelettes are out of this world as well as the sandwiches. Their selection of craft beers and house-made specialty cocktails complement the food very well, especially their bloody Mary.   I found their Flannel dishes to be on the salty side and so far this has been the only negative I've found. The friendly staff, unique to Orange Table and the Old Town Scottsdale scene, are engaging, entertaining, and informative. Orange Table is a truly unique addition to the otherwise competitive breakfast and lunch niches that Old Town is popular for.

I'll start with the end of our evening to save you some time. Me: "We came outside because a roach crawled across my shoulder, and now we're talking because another roach scurried across my girlfriend's feet." "Owner"/manager lady: "You're trying to get free food and it's not going to happen."     Despite the apparent bug problem and the Owner, whom is obviously omniscient, this place is still the worst excuse of a sushi bar. Perhaps it was my confrontation with an ignorant owner that ruined everything else, but you have MUCH BETTER OPTIONS in Old Town. Perhaps pre-gaming in a trash can will get your night rolling better.

Big Eye has grown to be one of my favorite Sushi spots in the valley, not only for its comfortable atmosphere, but for the superior sushi quality and execution. Scottsdale is known for overpriced, low-quality sushi restaurants that cater to the inexperienced sushi goer. Big Eye's sushi is fresh and well made. The atmosphere is hip and comfortable, and far beyond the pretentious spots in Scottsdale. Happy Hour here is all day every day, with a competitive HH Menu that gives you the opportunity to eat cheap and leave more than satisfied.   Yes, wait times can exceed your usual expectations, but when your food is delivered, you will be happy and craving more... I have never, ever, been upset with their sushi.   Big Eye has the potential to become anyone's favorite sushi spot. I always take my friends here and agree with me that the Sushi here is ranks in the upper echelon of Scottsdale Sushi. Come in and get to know the friendly staff. John is an incredibly talented Sushi chef, request anything from him and it will be extraordinary, go ahead and test him, make him sweat. Jason will always make the extra effort to make sure you are happy with your experience, he is very professional and personable. And "Yo," the owner, wants nothing more than to make you happy, get to know him and you'll see why this place is so special.

Since Big Eye opened, I have struggled to  find fresher fish. Alliteration aside, the goods here are top notch and you'd be hard pressed to find better deals elsewhere. Yes, I'm here quite a bit, which is why I am supremely confident in my upcoming recommendation. . . Make Big Eye a regular stop in the ever-growing, ever-competitive sushi gauntlet that is North Scottsdale. I love the atmosphere, the sushi, the beer, and the wonderful staff. Ask  Sushi Chef John for a "Carter Roll," and maybe my incoherent yammering, and incessant nagging will drown out as your taste buds make all the noise.

I was very impressed with Distrito. The overall ambiance caters to the younger crowd, which Old Town Scottsdale is known for, rather infamous for. With a live Dj, low lighting, and modern decor, this place is not for the older patrons wanting to have a quiet chat while dining.  The street style Mexican cuisine is right on point. I tried all five of their tacos, my favorite being the mahi-mahi, the grilled octopus was unlike any flavor or texture I've had before. Very Impressive. The duck dishes were perfectly cooked which shows just what kind of talent is working in the kitchen. I highly recommend trying the cuisine here, but make sure you've brought some money. The prices can get very high for a small amount of food, the only thing holding Distrito from five stars.
