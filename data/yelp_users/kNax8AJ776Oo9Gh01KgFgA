Been getting regular massage for a while and just tried a cranial-sacral to loosen up the muscles in my neck and jaw. Ashleigh works wonders and is very knowledgable on muscle groups and relieving tension. She found a problem with the muscles on one side of my body--something I wasn't even aware of--and recommended some stretches to me after our session. I will definitely be visiting her on a regular basis.   I wish this location had more of a tranquility room, but it's a small space and they're working well with what they've got. Massage rooms could be a little warmer in temperature, so ask your therapist to please turn the heat up if you think it's chilly.

Way better than Plato's Closet. Much bigger supply and more spacious than Plato's layout. Staff is great. Plato's wasn't even giving cash for clothes at the time so I called Buffalo Exchange and an employee cheerfully told me their store ALWAYS exchanges cash for clothes. Definitely the place to go if you're trying to sell.

Taco Tuesday's here are the best, and their margaritas rock! Stale chips and watery salsa need some work, but all their other food is great.

Great food. Great service. The atmosphere is nothing out of this world, but the restaurant looks and feels clean. This is one of the best places to go for authentic Vietnamese food.

The whole restaurant felt very muggy and humid, a little smelly. After 15-20 minutes of being seated, we still hadn't had anyone come take our drink order. We ended up having to ask another waiter if someone would be serving us. Then they forgot to put tequila in the margarita I ordered, so I returned it for a new one, which tasted pretty gross. Bottomless chips and salsa was good, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Just an all around bummer -- not impressed.

Seriously love this place! Service is fantastic. Your glass will never be empty for bottomless mimosas. When my food came out, my dish of sweet potato fries wasn't full to the brim, and my waiter brought me a whole other overflowing order without me even asking. I want to be here every Saturday and Sunday morning!

I went here for laser hair removal. Let me start by saying it's a great product. I loved how quick and painless my sessions were, and the staff were almost always helpful and kind. The problem isn't with the people or the product, it's with the membership model.   I initially bought the Groupon and got talked into switching over to a membership after my first session (they offered me a deal). The model is flawed because they were charging me every month for my membership but I only received treatments once every 6-8 weeks. So even during the months I wasn't getting a treatment, I was getting charged. That's not right.   You can't get out of the membership unless you move far away from any of their locations or can't receive treatments anymore for health reasons.   Also, they applied the $200 from my Groupon purchase to my monthly membership dues in increments so, when I cancelled my membership before all that Groupon money was used, they kept the rest of the money I had remaining in my account.   I would've been happy and would still be going to Simplicity Laser if I had just stuck with the Groupon. Save yourself a ton of money and don't sign up for a membership.

Took my bridesmaid dress here for alterations. Irena is the greatest! She was very accommodating to my schedule and even willing to meet me a little bit after regular store hours. The cost wasn't the cheapest, but I'm happy with the results. Definitely recommend!
