Your chicken fajitas taste like hot dogs and also have a hot dog consistency.  Manager said it was from the new marinade. Do you soak the fajita chicken in hot dog water? Smelled like boiled hot dogs too. GROSS. Won't ever be back.

Had them out to fix my ac....bam ...fixed in about ten minutes. Very efficient and friendly.  Maybe two weeks later we had them back to install a kitchen faucet,  not as fast but super nice. It was more than we expected to pay but my husband is hard of hearing so that was not chas roberts fault. 200 dollars more. But not hearing my husband cussing and complaining and throwing stuff...absolutely worth it.

Yuck....Yuck...YUCK! THE WINGS WERE COLD AND SUPER FATTY! SUPER SUPER FATTY! Virtually no meat. The pizza we ordered was supposed to be a jalape√±o double dough with extra cheese.  There was no extra cheese. The dough was like store bought.  I would have hated to see what the pizza with no extra cheese looked like. Maybe crummy tomato sauce slipped on a piece of cardboard. My daughter liked her chicken and rice soup. She also ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. We had to keep asking for more sauce and just left the rest of the slimy noodles there. We spent over 60.00 today for just the 3 of us. It was the most unappealing unappetizing dinner we have ever had. We used to go there quite a bit and would make the drive to this specific rosatis for a reason. It was always such a treat. So delicious. What did you all change? Besides EVERYTHING.  We will MOST DEFINITELY not be back. Out side it advertised the football games could he seen there.  All the tvs were not working. Our waitress was nice and friendly. We left her an okay tip. Poor girls going to get stiffed if people don't understand it is not her fault the food is not edible.

All 3 of us that ate there yesterday got sick.  Nothing like spending 60 bucks then throwing it all up.  Very over rated.  What a waste. A stomach ache and throwing up while on vacation. How.fun....so very overpriced

I remember back about a year ago this place was good. We used to order delivery all the time. Matter of fact, every party we had...we ordered a huge party pizza and it was so great and tatsy. Last 3 times we went in to the restraunt we got soggy pizza and greasy Italian fries.3rd times a charm. We won't be back

I didn't like that there were people in street clothes going in to the kitchen and walking around and getting their own drinks. There were 3 different cars during the time that we were there that had numerous people in the car with them and they would all go in and visit the workers and get their own food n drinks. Maybe they are employees.  I don't know but it seems very dirty and unsanitary to me to have them in n out. It was about 9 30 - 10 30 pm that we were there. My sisters corn dog came out and it was smashed. It had marks on it like it was stuck in a waffle iron or something. Also...the debit card reader wasn't working.

Only getting 2 stars cause I love their Mexican gumbo.....normally. not this time.  Went in tonight. First of all...they let a boy who was about 5 years old sit on the counter where you receive your food and pay. The girl ringing them out never told the boy to get his butt off the counter.  He sat there for a long while touching all the cups and stuff by the register. Gross. Then he finally jumped off after his mom had finally left the restaurant.  As he stood outside waiting for him and then he jumped down and ran out.  The worker never wiped the counter down. Yuck! Then as we were placing our order, the shredded beef was all dry...what was left of it and it was crusty looking. He still served it to us. Then, they went and got new meat. The guac was brown, the tortilla strip were stale. Ordered chips n salsa too. SUPER STALE. drove 30 miles just for the gumbo.  What a waste.  Would love my gas n food money back. Won't be back.

Loved the food. .. loved the service.  I only gave 4 stars because they forgot to give us silverware even when they brought my husband's salad. So the salad sat there until they brought our food about 5 minutes later. The manager apologized and asked how long the salad sat there but my husband told them not to worry about it. We will definitely be back. The chicken parm was soooo good. The mashed potatoes too. Mozzarella sticks could have come with more marinara but they were crispy and gooey. Yummy! My husband had a steak and really enjoyed it. He asked for a 1 sauce before he got it but after the first bite said it didn't need sauce. Overall....yum!!!

Food is great. Came 2 times in 1 week. Both times though...Juanita has bad customer service. Asked her for some things like chips and water cups and she said ok and never gave them to us. She moved on to the next people so we had to ask someone else. Today we are here again and she brought us our food and didn't say a word. Just flopped it down on the table. Didn't ask whose food was whos. We were flip flopping dishes around giving whoever had that certain food theirs. Not a people person. Maybe she would be best utilized in the kitchen where she doesn't interact with people

I used to Love this place...but when I went recently, it really changed. They seem to be taking shortcuts on the food. My daughter asked for a bean and cheese burrito. Plain...they put some kind of sauce in it and seemed bothered when she went up to get it corrected. The girl pushed the burrito back at her and said, well...you might as well keep it because we are just going to throw it away. We sat there and waited for a little while. As we waited...2 more people's orders were wrong. Wish they would get it right again. I used to love their food

The tea was just brownish water...my husband ordered 2 dozen bone in wings in hot. They were DISGUSTING. We have eaten here for years and he always went there for the wings and said they were THE BEST. Not sure where they get their wings from now but to be honest,  theu tasted lile the frozen tyson ones that we sampled at Costco.  Just more hot wing sauce. There was no meat on them. Just this weird jelly like fat substance. They were greasy and gooey. Disgusting.  We will kever be back. We frequented this place for the wings and baked minestrone soup (which used to also be good). Now it is just brown gravy and stale bread. I saw a half a noodle. Thats it. We tipped our waiter because it is not his fault that the food has gone down hill...SEVERELY.  45 Dollars and an hour of our life we will never get back. You have lost very loyal customers with the shortcuts you guys are taking. Never never EVER AGAIN. If you want fatty weird jelly on a chicken bone though, this is the place for you to go

I don't know where to start! Dave really came through for us. We are a small family owned business and our hard drive went out. OMG!!! Panic set it. We were open for business and we were at a complete loss for what to do. We called softque and Dave drove right over and installed a computer for us. Pulled all of our inventory and customer base out of the old hard drive and put it into our new computer. This is 11 years worth of inventory and customers.  None of us at the store would have had ANY clue on how to do that. He was so professional and prompt. We will semd everyone we know that needs computer work here. Thank you again

Best chips n salsa. I wanna take the whole bottle to myself. When I have parties  at home I order the Fiesta platters. Everything here is good. Only reason I gave 4 stars n not 5 is cause one time I went in n they ran out of Pollo fundido. Gave me a regular chicken burrito. I was looking forward to fundido. Anything fried is better right? Fast service..clean restaurant

I don't even want to give one star. Worst dining experience ever. EVER!! Got there at 700 p.m. ordered 2 waters, and an iced tea. Then the wait began....the waitress. ..rude and overworked...took our orders. There were only 3 of us. At 8:10 we were still sitting waiting for our burgers n fries. The waitresses were not anywhere to be found. I kept asking how much longer and she kept saying...I dont know..like...can you ask the cooks??? People were walking out left and right. The waitresses were meeting people at the door talking people out of staying. They told them to come back early afternoon when it is slower. What are we supposed to do for dinner tonight? They ran out of bacon, shoestring fries, pastrami, diet coke. Finally...we just left. I heard the waitresses apologizing to people with to go orders the whole time we sat there too. Never ever ever would I go here again. We were there for over an hour and in that time...only 1 table got their food. Get it together!  It is quite a drive in the middle of nowhere so I was hoping it would be a hidden gem. NOPE!!! This place has a lot to learn about running a restaurant and customer service. Save your gas!

Never been to a b dubbs before but, despite the reviews on here, my daughter wanted to eat there for her 16th birthday.  It was clean. The food came out hot. Dallas (sorry, forgot how to spell your unique name) Daylus?? Anyhow, she waited on us and was SUPER FRIENDLY!She talked to us like shes known us for years. I love that. She is totally in the right job for her! They had the whole place tell our daughter happy birthday.  It was amazing. The food....AWESOME!!! WE WILL BE BACK!
