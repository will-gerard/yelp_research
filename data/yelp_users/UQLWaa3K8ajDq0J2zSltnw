This is our favorite local restaurant. We've been coming here for dinners (and a Mother's Day brunch) since mid-2009, when I found it on Yelp. It's in a nondescript shopping center, and if not for the constant traffic jam outside, you probably wouldn't even notice it.  I particularly like the lighting inside the restaurant; it's very relaxed and seems classier than it should be, given the location.  The burger is great, but the chicken sandwich is easily the best I've had. I also enjoy the PCG Pasta. And they have a lot of great beers on tap.  We live in Chandler now, but I'll make the drive to PCG any time I get an opportunity!

We went here the other day because my fiancee used to go all the time with her dad when she was a kid. She hadn't been back in 15 years or so. Apparently, it's exactly the same, and the food was still pretty good. The servers were friendly, the food came out fast, and there seemed to be a lot of "regulars" in attendance.  It's pretty standard Chinese food, but a nice, intimate atmosphere.

Long waits. No parking. DELICIOUS food. What else do you need to know?

Kiltlifter: Remains my favorite (and most hangover-inducing) beer.  Waitstaff: Remains the most attractive in the Valley.  Food: Remains the best of any brewery I've visited, although Santan is closing the gap.  I just wish the place hadn't blown up the way it has; you used to be able to just walk in and sit down anywhere you could find a table. Now there's a hostess, a waiting list, those vibrating coaster things, etc. Maybe they'll add a second level. I'm sure the apartment dwellers across the street would love that.

The bartender with the gauged ears makes the world's best Bloody Mary. And the filet mignon is among the best steaks I've had.  That is all.

In my single days, this was my default first-date restaurant: laid-back and casual, cheap, and fast enough that a potentially disastrous first date wouldn't drag on for more than an hour. My fiancee (who, oddly enough, I did not bring here on our first date) and I still come here occasionally. I discovered it back in 2005, shortly after it opened, when a friend told me about it; it's gotten pretty well known now, but with its location, it's not the kind of place you'd just stumble upon.  I've tried many different pasties, and I keep coming back to the Oggie (the "Original Pasty") with the red wine gravy. Paired with a Hoegarden, it's the best meal for the money in Tempe.

This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I worked at the East Valley Tribune down the street. I used to come here a lot with one of my co-workers because she enjoyed ogling the help (and also because the chicken pita with lemon mustard sauce was delicious).  Right before I changed jobs and moved across town, George's turned up in the paper's "Dirty Dining" feature about health code violations. I haven't been back since then, but judging from the reviews, I assume they've cleaned the place up (they would have been shut down if they hadn't). I'll have to go back some time!

I used to come here for work lunches all the time, but I will never come back to this or any Red Robin. Maybe it's completely freaking irrational of me to say that, but I had a bad experience here and I don't want to take the chance that it might reoccur.  I got one of those burgers with the fried onion strings on it, but on this particular burger it was like they fried a whole onion, without slicing it, and slapped it onto the burger. I bit into it and a huge clump of onions ended up in my mouth. Rather than spitting it out and making a huge ass of myself in a crowded restaurant, I chewed on it for about 10 minutes, trying desperately to mince it into smaller pieces so I could swallow it without choking or gagging, while my girlfriend laughed at me. When I finally forced it down, I was so grossed out I didn't even want the rest of the burger.  You may have a better experience! In fact, you very likely will! But I will Red Robin no more forever.

I've been here twice, which was obviously enough. The first time was in 2002, before I was old enough to drink legally. It became obvious to me then that state fairs are only fun for people over 21 or under 12.  In 2008, I came with some friends who bought a $6 hamburger at one of the tents, took one bite, and threw it in the trash. One of them remarked later that it was the only time in his life he'd spit food out in disgust. While this was happening, another friend and I asked a toothless Vietnam veteran manning another tent where we could find the nearest restroom. His reaction suggested that we were insane for asking such a ridiculous question; we surmised that perhaps, due to some bizarre war injury, he had not taken a piss since 1973. Bottom line, customer service is not high on the priority list at the state fair. Nor is edible food.

I'd never been to this place before I moved to Chandler, but I was obviously missing out. The stuffed bacon cheeseburger is one of the best burgers I've had, and the Great Chandler Burger is right up there too. They both go great with a Sunspot Gold or Devil's Ale. We like sitting outside, because our 10-month-old son enjoys it out there. No beer for him until he's at least 8, though.

I can't believe the average rating isn't higher for this place. My only real complaint about it is that it's so far away, especially now that they closed their other location. I got hooked on contemporary Indian food not too long ago, and Bombay Spice does it well.

This place will always be special to me. I took my now-fiancee here on our first real date. About a year later, we came back for dinner, and I proposed at the jellyfish park nearby. That probably doesn't mean a lot to you, but the food and atmosphere are great too. The menu changes a lot, but I've never had anything I didn't enjoy!

For a while, I was usually the only person in here when I came in. Lately I've seen more people eating in the restaurant, which is good. The help is always very nice, and the manager (and owner, I'm assuming) probably sleeps on a cot in the back, because he's ALWAYS there. The food is cheap, and the deals they have for families are a great value. I hope they get a good lunch crowd during the week or something, because I don't want to see this place shut down!

Went down to BDiT yesterday, not really sure what I wanted but knowing I didn't have a lot to spend. Jeff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the selection, and I walked out 20 minutes later with a 40" Sony that looks great in our living room. I will definitely be back here for future TV purchases!

We just purchased our first home with help from Steven James at The Hill Group. We had no idea what we were getting into, but Steven was very helpful and informative every step of the way. We started our search almost six months ago but then had to put it on hold while we sorted out some financial issues. Steven was very patient and understanding, and once we started looking again, he was able to find us a fantastic house that was almost completely move-in ready and within our price range.  Additionally, when our bank began making things difficult regarding mortgage requirements, Steven put us in touch with another lender that provided an equally high level of service, enabling us to get into our house at least two months earlier than would otherwise have been possible.  Buying a house is always stressful, but Steven made it as easy as it could be, and I can't recommend him and The Hill Group highly enough.
