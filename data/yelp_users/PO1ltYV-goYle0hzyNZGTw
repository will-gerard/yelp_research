Really not good service. They were so focused on closing a section down then having customers.  She told me we would have to wait...  We come here more than once a week, well this was the last time for my team...

The service was super, I mean really good and happy.  Their was one little slip up that they caught immediately and as fast as it happened they were on top of it, the manager Jared came to make sure our experience was spectacular and even covered the mistake.    We loved it and will go back again and again.  MJB

I can't say enough about this place.  Junior was really great as well, even though he isn't a fan of the Seahawks:)    The food was as good as it gets, Thank you for a great experience.

I think finally we have a great family friendly bar and restaurant at Tatum and Bell.  The food was absolutely perfect.  The atmosphere was genuine and even with a bit of a Folky feel, they also have a private room for fantasy football drafts or meetings.    But the service really stands out as my favorite, thanks RJ and Micayla, you killed it, MJB
