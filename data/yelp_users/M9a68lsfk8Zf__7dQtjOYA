Wow this place is horrible. You get what you pay for. They try to through on extras and up charge everything. No, I don't want the extra insurance or the GPS. Then they told us we should upgrade from the economy car to something nicer like a Versa. Again we said no thank you. When we went to pick up our car we were given an Elantra. Nicer than even the versa. Go figure. You get a good price, but have to listen to them try to up sell you.

My life was incomplete before I experienced he glory on In N Out Burger. I always wondered what the big deal was and now I know!!! It's amazing, incredible and delicious all at the same time!  I ordered the fries- animal style, which you need to try if you haven't yet. These were the best concoction of fast food fried I have ever had. I wish It were an option on the menu. I almost missed out until I saw it on the yelp page! I also got a cheeseburger and split a small chocolate shake. We were not able to finish all our food!
