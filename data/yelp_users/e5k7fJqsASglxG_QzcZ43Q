.... long story short:  Another brake place? Total screw job.  This brake place? Honest, fair, friendly.   Carl was a fantastic help and I will be returning.

Having arranged our large group in advance, we were given 1/2 the space we needed, the restaurant itself was uncomfortably warm, and the service was awful - to put it nicely.  After not being allowed to sit at one of the four open tables, several of us sat at the bar next to other patrons (not with our group) who were drinking and eating. When we mentioned to the bartender, whose attention it took almost 15 minutes to get, that we would like to order, he was clearly put out at the prospect of having to deal with it.  A few minutes later when I asked for a glass of ice water, the bartender said "NO. Not at the BAR".   When our food came, it was delicious (although one of the orders was wrong).  In general the entire staff at the restaurant seemed put upon by our group.  It's a shame, really, because the food was delicious. Pretty sure I won't be returning to Blue Adobe Grill.

Found these two (thanks to twitter) at the Tet Festival in Mesa. I tried the banana, mango, vanilla cream and crushed meringue crepe. It was unbelievable. Fantastic flavor and texture on a perfectly made crepe.   Delicious food from a sweet couple.. I will be watching their twitter feed tor more locations (hopefully soon!).  Yum!
