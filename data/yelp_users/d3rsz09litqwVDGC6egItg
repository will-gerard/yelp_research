I am a sucker for a good Mojito.  I heard they had good Mojitos so I made a trip.  I enjoyed the food, the environment was pretty nice and of course the drinks we amazing!  I was a little taken aback by the fact that they seat you in cheap plastic lawn chairs however, the rest of the experience was great!  I will be back....

My visit to the FBH was absolutely over the top!  I experienced over the top customer service, the food was over the top good and the portions were over the top huge!  Needless to say there was some serious over indulgence on my part... I'm right there with Dottsy Z.- the Big Red Cream Soda washes the guilt right down! The manager talked with me for a long time and was helpful with making a decision- it all looked so good I almost couldn't imagine picking only a few things... In the end I believe I made the right call because I was so full when I left the I actually pondered unbuttoning my jeans... fortunately I was out with friends and had to keep my dignity about me.   I will definitely be putting this place into my regular rotation of favorites...

I enjoyed the wine and the food but my experiences with the servers have repeatedly left a bad taste in my mouth... I wish that they had some help that didn't treat you like a second class citizen.  I don't go anymore for this reason. If I wanted to be treated like I was nothing but an oxygen sponge I could probably do it much cheaper...

I have to admit that I am a bit of a Mexicanfoodaholic, I could pretty much eat Mexican food 3 times a day and 4 on nights that we go out drinking.  I cannot say enough good things about Humberto's.   I have to say for a "Quick Service" Mexican food experience it doesn't get much better than this.  I have never been disappointed and I have tried quite a few items on the menu.  My personal favorite is the Machaca (it is amazing) and it keeps me coming back again and again.  The staff is very nice and accomodating.  The seating is not the most comfortable but the food is soooo good that you will finish before you have a chance to notice...

I absolutely loved my first experience at Sweet Republic and am already looking for reasons to go back.  I believe I will start taking all of my friends one at a time (this means many more trips for me)!  I loved the customer service, the flavors and the passion that they clearly have for creating wonderful flavor combinations.   Choosing was the hardest part!  I was only able to decide on what to have after I consoled myself with the knowledge that I would be back soon and could have something different...

Humble Pie- Humble is right.  It was not all that I had hoped for... First of all the server took and quite a while to come over initially and was pretty scarce for the rest of the night. Second of all he forgot my glass of wine- which wouldn't be such a horrible faux pas except that when I gently asked if I could get my glass of wine I got a snide and curt "yes"- I just had to hope that he remembered what I had ordered. Fortunately he did and brought it without so much as a word about forgetting it. It just kinda put me off. The food was decent- nothing that I don't think I couldn't get somewhere else. Overall, nothing about the place made me think to myself I can't wait to come back here.
