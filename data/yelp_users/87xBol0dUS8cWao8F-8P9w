O My Gosh! Me and my husband alwasy come here, and we love it! Everytime we go, it's always so packed we can barely move in and out of the crowds of people... but thats what makes it fun... They have three different dance rooms with different styles of music in each one. Me and my guy love the salsa/bachata room. They also have a nice poutdoor patio type thingy... when the weathers nice its ah - mazing! I never pay for our drinks so I couldnt tell you how that goes, but as far as the having fun part its def up to par!  We always run into friends and another plus is theyre open till 4am!!!! Obviously last call is at 2am.... but we dance off all our alchohal and still leave with a nice buzz.... I guess you would have to be into latin style music, but Im telling u... u wont be disappointed if your adventurous.

I have eaten here about 5 to 7 years ago, and was not impressed. I recently wanted a steak and our usual place was closed, it was about 9:30 pm. It was pretty empty, as a matter of fact, everytime we go it's usually empty. But better for us. I always order the filet mignon steak, medium. Everytime, it's perfection. It's always done just to my liking and its still juicy and very tender. Not chewy and hard like other places. The broccolli is to die for, they serve it steamed with parmesean cheese on it. Yum. I haven't ever tried anything else on the menu, (why go to a steak place and not order steak? duh.) but I do always make sure to order the mud pie dessert. I get it to go, the portion is so big I eat a little then take it home and can eat the rest of it a couple days later. They always have coupons floatig around, but even without one, this place is still an affordable steak restraunt.

ok so I work next door at the bead store, we've all had our share of encounters with this horrible place. A couple of times we've gotten bugs in our food... not fun! We have rats coming thru our walls from their place... and we always see them sharpening their tools outside on the cement. Not to mention, the owner is a complete bitch! She is rude and i would NEVER NEVER recommend this place to anyone. We have customers coming in all the time complaining about this place or asking us how their food is, and as soon as we tell them the horrors, they thank us, and we reccomend them to a nicer better place.

HANDS DOWN! BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER! I did go to Chandler High, that was my first of many encounters with Elmer and his yummy food. I usually go about once or twice a month but have been known to hit it up weekly in the past. I've even turned the fam onto it, my kids usually get the bean and cheese burritos... ( I have to say, I am not a fan of bean and cheese burritos, but this place adds their salsa in them. One word. AMAZING!) I always get the cheese enchilada's and the strips. Ah the strips. Even if it is only chips and shredded cheese, the salsa makes it! I think you can even buy their salsa. They have always have specials, and my husband loves theier taco specials. Their bright building helps attract passerbys but if ur not looking u prob wont c it... I love how it's family owned and operated too. Just try it, U wont be sorry.

Ok, so we've been here  a total of two times... the first was a pretty good experience... not memorable, but ok. Then we went again, last night for Mothers Day. My Dad wanted the Trout so bad, so us Mothers gave in. The only positive thing to say about them is how nice they were, we called to see if we could get in at for dinner at 8:30pm, (they closed at 9pm) they said not a problem. I was kinda impressed cuz we've called other restaraunts and they have turned us down in the same senario.... when we sat down, we ordered right away, it took awhile for us to get our food, i finally had to flag our waitress down and ask her to bring whatever was ready whenever it was ready. My salad was probably the best thing I had that night next to the water. Come on tho, how hard is it to mess up salad and a water! My Dad had the trout, he finished it but said it wasnt the best, my Mom had the Chicken Parmesean. She picked around the stuff she didn't like. I ordered a coconut shrimp apetizer, it arrived cold. The bill for two adult entrees and one appetizer a small ceaser salad and one childs meal was $80....  we still tipped $20, but $100 for one of the worst meals in a long time wasn't worth it. We won't be back at least for awhile.

Seriously? Hands down, THE BEST STEAK PLACE EVER!  They have every type of steak a meat lover could want. They also offer chicken and pork, ribs... etc. Their salad bar is decent but don't waste your time. It'll fill you quick, and in my experiences there, wait out for the meat. Its a nice place too, so dress up. It ruins the experience of the ambiance. Its a quick eat, we got in and out of there under an hour. I was very impressed. You can start eating as soon as you sit down. And another plus.... you can eat all you want! It's a bit pricey, at like $50 a person starting off, but well worth it, for the experience alone. Its a perfect fun date place too. They have a nice bar area, too.

I purchased a living social deal from Twenty20 Window Cleaning, and as soon as I called he made time for my appt right away. He was out only a few days later to my salon Hair Ink. He did an awesome job, I will definitely be calling him next time I need my windows all cleaned and pretty.

Let me just start off by saying, I have a serious coffee addiction after finding this place. I never used to drink coffee. I always hated how it tasted, if I did get something it was only ever a Frappuccino from Starb#$!s (shhhhh) but after the very first dutch Bros 3 years ago, I was hooked. Haven't been to a drive thru of the other guys in years! I've only tried a few things on the Dutch menu... 'why fix it if it ain't broke' type of philosophy here. I highly recommend a white zombie. It's not on their menu but some one told me about it and now it's my go to drink. I'm almost ashamed to tell you I go almost every single day. Don't judge me. And on Tuesdays they offer two stamps for every drink you get - yes tis true they have stamp cards. Every 10 stamps you get a free drink of your choice and any size! So naturally Tuesdays I offer to buy coffee for a few friends...  cuz I'm such a good friend like that.  I do have to say if you are not a morning person, beware! The kids behind those windows are quite peppy for such early morning work gigs. I don't mind. As I'm pretty sure the requirement to work there is young, cute, and complimentary.  I swear they are required to give each customer a great compliment. I can't even tell you, heading to that place I'm grumpy (need my coffee fix) and feeling fat or ugly that day ... welp, after I pull up to that window all of a sudden I'm smiling and being told that my 'eyebrows are on point that day' or my 'tattoos are really amazing' and I'm right back to being on top. I would say if I had to complain about anything it would be that too many people know about the amazing place! There's always a dang line! But it's not so bad they're super quick getting us thru it. If they really wanna impress me they'll have my super difficult order remembered as soon as they see me in the back of the line. Actually, I'm on my way for coffee in 10. See you there.

The grounds are nice and the staff is very friendly. Shout out to Grandpa Frank in Prado! But the check in and out staff at the registration desk were short and unfriendly. We purchased a room through Groupon yet still paid 230$ for only one night. My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice resort so I thought, 'why not!?' I booked the room. As soon as we got into our room there were bugs everywhere. Boyfriend killed a spider w babies. There was a dead cockroach, beetles every where and those damn pincher beetles. We had to shake out all our clothes before we packed everything, because we found bugs in our clothes as well. I was so disappointed in our room. The rugs were starting to tear and the walls were dirty. They did have a patio as claimed. But the patio was filthy, ants all over the chairs and spider webs everywhere. You could tell no one had cleaned it in awhile. When I mentioned to the check out girl our awful experience with the room she just kinda shrugged. I feel like if I  gave them our exterminating bill for all the bugs we killed while we were there, they'd owe me money. I would not recommend this resort to anyone that asked. I'm so disappointed I spent over 400$ at this place. I really wish they'd refund me so I could spend my hard earned money somewhere else.
