I've been going to see Scott and Jill for 5 years and have been extremely happy with their services.  Recently, I decided to reset quite a few pieces of jewelry. The suggestions and styles recommended to me were right on. My newly designed  jewelry are pieces I will never want to reset again.  I actually love going in,  not just to see their beautiful jewelry, but seeing everyone's smiling faces.  I recommend them highly  and would never go any where else! You don't know what you're missing.

I've eaten here a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed every meal. The food is fresh and service has been great.  They have take out, too.  Prices are reasonable and they serve drinks. They have a great all day happy hour.

This is the best Italian food I've had to date in Scottsdale. Six of us went for dinner and everyone loved their meal. The service was great, as well. We loved it so much that we had dinner delivered the next evening.  Highly recommended

After seeing Jim on ABC, i called him the same day and set up an appointment  Jim was informative and provided me information regarding state of the art security equipment. He is extremely knowledgeable and gave great recommendations how best to secure my home. he provided me with a free system and a very fair monitoring rate.

I have brought my dog for a previous shear and another time for a bath. The experiences for my puppy were fine.  My puppy does have some fear issues which I told the groomer about.   This time I used a different groomer. He shaved his testicles almost to the point of making them  bleed. I couldn't figure out why he kept flapping his hears  The inside of his ears had scabs on them.  He came home to hide in the closets, bathroom and under tables. I had to take him to the vet who actually told me never to go back to the groomer. He has been so traumatized that he has been put on Prozac and xanax. I have contacted a trainer to work with him at $100 per hour  Today I went back to wag and wash to speak to the manager and tell them what happened and ask to be given back my money for the grooming and costs for the vet and prescriptions. He made copies of the paperwork and told me he would speak to the other manager in another facility and would call me back. Im hoping they will do the right thing and reimburse me.    Needless to say it will be a cold day in hell that I ever go back there again. This whole experience was heartbreaking.

I have heard back from them and they refuse to accept any responsibility and have refused to compensate me for anything I incurred including the grooming fee. What kind of business does that?  One that I will never recommend or step foot in. Not good business practice wag n wash!

My dog, a Spanish Water Dog, was traumatized at the last groomer I went to who didn't listen and without a discussion shaved him in a place that he shouldn't be shaved . These dogs get sheared, no brushing and are air dried. Very few groomers have ever seen them. I decided to stop in See Spot and speak to them and they said Arturo was the groomer for me.   I brought in my SWD and my daughters.  As I walked in Arturo came to greet us.  I was prepared to show him pictures and have a long detailed how to.  Arturo already did his homework and read about the breed.  Well, we picked them up and they were perfect. Really perfect. We are so happy that I am already recommending them to others.  I'm not going anywhere else. Everyone was so nice and helpful!
