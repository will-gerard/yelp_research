A note to whoever is the manager:  When your website information claims that you are open until 10:00 pm, it is bad business to close early for all food items. We arrived at 9:45 pm and after waiting to order at around 9:50, we were told the kitchen closed early at 9:50 pm. The drive through had at least five cars in it and we came specifically because we wanted to order off the food menu. We then were stuck waiting in the drive through for other people to get their food because we could not exit, even though we could not order anything. If your business hours state 10 pm, you should remain open until that time. This is pretty much a given in the restaurant industry, even if you in high school and working at a fast food change. I plan on submitting this information onto corporate as I think they will be interested to know how you are not adhering to your advertised business hours.

Sam was our server today for lunch, she was an example of what every server should strive to be. Knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. I wanted to adopt her. Keep hiring people like Sam and I will continue to come back!!

After not being able to order chicken strips at Dairy Queen down the road (because of how incompetent and generally unpleasant their staff was)... We decided to come get chicken fingers here and while going through the drive through, were presented with Angie. She was absolutely delightful, pleasant and actually understood the concept of customer service. There was also another cheerful male employee singing in the kitchen while cleaning when we pulled up to the window. We are glad Dairy Queen failed so hard tonight because it brought us to making a more solid choice with you guys. Thank you for the positive vibes and proper customer care.
