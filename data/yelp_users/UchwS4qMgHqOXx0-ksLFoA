After seeing a movie at the nearby Harkins, my family and I went there for my cousin's birthday dinner. We picked this place based on the positive online reviews. The place was unimpressive looking, but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign (nobody lines up and waits for bad food...or at least they shouldn't). After half an hour we got seated. They placed us in what looked like an addition to the building and it was freezing! They had the A/C blasting and a ceiling fan going. Our server was very nice, and our drinks and salads came out rather quick. Then it took a turn for the worse. Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food. And the food was pretty mad. We ordered spaghetti, eggplant parmesan, and the manicotti. Ragu tastes better than the sauce that they seemingly have an neverending supply of. And the eggplant was mushy and unflavorful. To add insult to injury, the prices were absurd! They charged prices on par with higher end Italian restaurants...yet this place is a far cry from anything upscale. Maybe this place is only good for the pizza, but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance.

Went there for some late night grubs after First Friday. I've been a couple times before as it's really just a fun place to get some yummy Irish food (oh how I love thee!) and drinks. And they have hard cider which is a total bonus in my book. They had a fantastic live band playing some kickin' Irish tunes and the staff was super friendly. I only wish they had bangers and mash on the menu, but oh well.

I would like to thank IHOP for making my love of this place possible. IHOP you say? Yes, IHOP. I had driven by here on numerous occasions and was intrigued because bakeries not located in grocery stores are few and far between 'round these parts. Luckily I had just the opportunity to try it out when my out-of-state relatives wanted to get together for breakfast at...IHOP. Gag me with a spoon. I talked some sense into them and redirected our gathering to Essence. Of course the pressure was on because I had suggested a place completely foreign to me to a bunch of hungry people. And hungry people = easily irritable people. Thank my lucky stars this place was amazing. The waitstaff was very accommodating to our relatively large party of 8 + 2 babies (the inside is cozy and more meant for parties of 2 or 4) and our server couldn't have been nicer. And the food was drool-worthy. I had the French Crepes and was so sad when I reached the bottom of the dish. Had no one been watching, I would have licked the plate clean. And yes, the macaroons are divine. I actually had no idea they were known for them until I saw those little pieces of heaven in the bakery display case. I ordered a couple to take home along with a box of assorted mini treats...all very tasty. I am now a repeat customer. The only downside is when it's busy it can get a bit chaotic. There are two cash registers, but the line to order food/baked goodies can still get backed up and block the door (and create that whole awkward "strangers hovering by your table" experience), and the coffee/beverage prep area is in a cramped corner so when several people are trying to get straws, napkins, creamer all at the same time the area can turn into human bumper cars.

My husband and I decided to try this place out for one of our date nights. Overall the experience was okay.   Atmosphere - The place was pretty hopping for a Tuesday night, but we got seated almost right away. The atmosphere was very "clubby," not intimate or cozy. Definitely resembled a place you'd go to pick up someone or go with a group of friends.  Service - The hostess and server were friendly enough. Our primary server was nice, but not very attentive. She only checked on us once during our meal. The gal who brought out our food was not very friendly and seamed to be in a rush. She'd run food out, curtly announce what it was, and then shove it onto the table and huff off. It could be that she was short-handed and was really busy, but it was a little off-putting.  Drinks - We ordered a beer and a Wango Mango martini (we were delighted to find out that Tuesdays were Ladies Night with 1/2 price martinis. My husband asked our server if she could believe that he was a lady so he could get in on the deal. She was not amused). While the martini was tasty, it was weak and I could not justify ordering one for regular price. ($9.50 for a martini!? Yikes!) Food - I appreciated the variety of the menu, from appetizers, to signature rolls there was a lot to choose from. Here is what we ordered:        Pork Eggrolls - Yum! Nice and crispy, not greasy, and a delicious dipping sauce        to boot!        Salmon Nigiri - Good portion size, tasted very fresh        Dam Jumper - A little on the small size, a nice change-up of having the roll wrapped in salmon, the least favorite of the three rolls we ordered        Tropic Thunder - Very, very good. Sweet and spicy, the pineapple salsa was an interesting and delicious addition, nice large-sized roll         Philadelphia - Your typical Philly roll, good size, very fresh tasting Price - As mentioned before, martini prices were very steep. As for food, there were many higher priced rolls on the menu and almost everything seemed to be priced a dollar or two more than what's typically at most sushi establishments.   So, overall, the food was good. Only a few things stood out as winners. But definitely not worth the price. As numerous reviewers have mentioned, go for happy hour. Then it may be worth it.

First time eating here and probably won't go back. I am a huge fan of Caprese sandwiches, so I was really excited to see it on the menu. Wish I was excited when the server brought it to the table. Just looking at it, all I saw was bread. They were incredibly stingy with the toppings. Just the bare minimum of mozzarella and tomato. While the ingredients were fresh, there was so little of them that I essentially paid $6.99 for some toasted bread. I felt ripped off.
