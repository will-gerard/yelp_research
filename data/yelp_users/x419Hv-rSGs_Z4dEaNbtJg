This place was great. We enjoyed how small and authentic it was. Low pretense, great food.

Pete has been my dad's barber for over a decade. I make the trip here just to see him.

We have been to other Famous Dave's in the past and were happy. I spent 9 years in St Louis and 3 years in Dallas and have 2 grills and a smoker to show for it.  I never expect incredible barbecue from a chain but this was bad enough to prompt a review.   I am not sure who the pit master was on a Saturday afternoon, but the ribs were dry and the brisket I was served was nothing but a fat cap.   The service was excellent.

I am a new rider. Loved the course. Learned skills that many experienced riders likely lack. Definitely recommend.

My first time here but I love these places. For $7 you get a good exterior was and mostly dry (bring a shami for touch up).  The reason I prefer this to the full service places is that you also get free vacuum and a shaded place to clean out your interior.  YOU will always do a better job in 30 minutes than you would waiting 30 minutes for the full service place.  Bring some simple car care supplies and do a better job for $7 than you get for $25 at most places.

I have purchased a custom couch and two dining sets from Mega Furniture.  The furniture has been great, my biggest problem is with their delivery and warranty services.   I recently ordered more chairs for the dining area and was reminded of their 10 hour delivery window.  Really?  A delivery fee of $100 and you can't give me a window more narrow than 8am-6pm?  I tried at one point to have a warranty repair done on the couch, only to find there was a $150 pickup fee, also with a 10 hour delivery window.   Just negotiate a better delivery prior to your purchase.

A great place.  We have eaten here a few times and it the opportunity to have healthy minimally processed food for not much money. The day they decided to give away free bowls in exchange for donations to anti-bullying campaign sealed the deal.

We like conveyor sushi because it is entertaining for our kids and encourages them to try new things.  This was a pleasant surprise because the quality of the food was high and the prices were still relatively low for North Scottsdale sushi.  The kids loved the interesting bathrooms!

I can not speak to other reviews but I can say I dropped my iPhone 6 in the parking lot of my Casa Grande office and shattered the screen.  I carry insurance only to find out they would not repair it but would only replace it with a refurbished phone at a cost of $199.  So much for my insurance.  I found Tony using Google.  He replaced the screen on my iPhone 6 for $120 in about 20 minutes.  I know the glass is a little different from the original, but it looks great and was done quickly.

I have used Sergio for two moves of Craigslist purchases.  He and a helper (Sergio and Anthony) have shown up on time, moved items with care and been completely professional.  This is far more efficient for most small moves than trying to rent a Uhaul or gather friends.
