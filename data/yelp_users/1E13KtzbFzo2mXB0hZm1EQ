On the way to an afternoon conference with a coworker, we decided to make a convenient turn into the parking lot of In-N-Out to grab a quick bite (he had never had In-N-Out and I couldn't let him leave without trying it). We each got our burgers (animal style) and fries, sat down, and devoured everything.   I'm not a fast food kinda gal, and I never order burgers anywhere- unless they are known for them- these burgers are some of the best! Everything is homemade here, down the the hand cut fries, so don't expect to get your food before the blink of an eye (like you might at the golden arches).   Learn from others and order the burger animal style (grilled onions, special spread, etc.) or protein style (lettuce instead of a bun)!

This rating is based soley on their soup and chopped liver. On my recent visit, my mom suggested we make a stop here on the way home to get some sweet and sour cabbage soup- and that we would get some chopped liver for my dad since he really liked it the last time. The sweet and sour soup was good but didn't have a lot of flavor. I actually prefer the soup I make myself. The chopped liver came with a choice of bread (we got the challah which was okay), and the liver itself was very tasty. I'd love to come back and try a sandwich, as the meat looked really good...so there is potential for a much higher rating after that happens!!

A friend who went to school at ASU told me that Four Peaks is on her list to eat at every time she returns to AZ. Since she has well trusted culinary instincts (in my book, at least), I insisted that we try it out the next time I was there...and we have been going every time since!  I don't like beer (even though I keep trying to convince myself), but will never stop me from coming here! The food is absolutely delish! My go-to is the chicken beer bread sandwich. While the beer bread is actually more like a flat bread and doesn't have a strong beer flavor, I cannot get enough of it! They should cut it up in triangles and serve it as an app!! They have enormous hearty salads and other really good dishes too, but I still can't veer from that sandwich- which is easily big enough for 2 to share.  Oh, and how could I forget about dessert? There is an oatmeal stout milkshake that is different, yet oh-so-good, even for those that despise beer (this has been tested out).  If you're ever around ASU- and even if you have to drive a half hour (or more) to get here, it is worth it. Sit on the patio to catch some rays while you eat/drink, or in the brewery to admire the beer being made while you guzzle some down yourself....

Don't let the looks of this place deceive you. A friend who lived in the area took me here Monday night for happy hour, and I have to admit I was a little skeptical. He raved about the food, but I wasn't too sure what his standards were.  Upon walking in, we scoped out the place and decided to sit at the bar, but there were plenty of tables elsewhere and seating outside, as well. The owner, Greg, greeted us as we Sat down and got us drinks right away. He also offered to change the channel on one if the TVs if we wanted.  We took advantage of happy hour prices ($5 well drinks) and ordered a few beverages. Then, we perused the huge menu....they have a lot of choices sure to please all- even a "skinny" menu! The chicken teriyaki sliders and BBQ chicken cheese quesadilla (you must try- it really works!) were the winners. Greg continued to talk to us, making us feel welcome. He's really into making the customers happy and putting out the best food (not "bar food"). Both goals were achieved on this visit!  The chicken teriyaki sliders were tasty- small grilled chicken breasts topped with cheddar cheese and served on mini slider buns, with a cup of teriyaki sauce to dip. We opted for the whole order (6 sliders) since we were sharing, but a half order is available, too.   The BBQ chicken cheese quesadilla was my favorite. The BBQ sauce sneaking out of the quesadilla was smoking hot and yummy, as was the cheesy goodness inside. This is definitely large enough for 2 to split as a meal, or several people to share as an appetizer. I would order this again in a heartbeat!  If you're in the mood for great food in a bar atmosphere, this is the place for you. Don't come in looking for college kids or a younger crowd (at least not on a Monday night). There is plenty to keep you occupied here, too- whether it be the several TVs, pool tables, or a live band, which was just starting to play as we left around 8:30. And, don't forget to say hi to Greg!

I stumbled across this gem while looking for another store...I guess my lack of direction can pay off sometimes! If you are looking for some beautiful unique chocolates that are made locally, this is your place. Visiting from out of state, I was looking for a gift for somebody to bring back. What a perfect gift, and who doesn't like chocolate?! (You can't be my friend if the answer is you).  Julia offers a small selection of homemade chocolates, truffles and cake balls. The selection isn't enormous, so the indecisive (like myself) won't be too challenged. I easily filled a box with an assortment sure to please anybody. The prices are a tad on the high side but worth it in my opinion- especially with the excellent service and samples I was so graciously given!  The other half of the store will satisfy your sweet tooth if you are looking to sit down for a dessert or specialty drink. That may just have to happen the next time I'm in the area!

Alright, I should start this review with a warning that I hate casinos, unless I'm in Vegas. However, I was dragged here by my family and only agreed to go because I was told of this really cool Coke machine they supposedly had. So after some negotiating, I agreed to go.  Thanks to the Coke machine, I was easily entertained the whole time I was there. This thing has just about every Coke product made in the USA (Coke, Sprite, Fanta, Dasani, Powerade etc.) and then around 5-7 flavors of each product. It was pretty cool. And I have to admit I tried more combinations than I could count.  Oh yeah, this review is about the casino. The moment I walked in the door, I felt like I needed a gas mask. I've been in many casinos and bars (and am usually not the one to complain of the person smoking next to me), but this one reeked of cigarettes. I thanked my family for poisoning me when we left.  The bingo room is huge, and people claim their spot long before bingo starts- these people are serious. And the buffet must be a popular hot spot here if it forms a line of people almost back to the entrance of the casino. Don't worry about getting a babysitter for the kids- they are welcome run around the place, too; apparently they don't card anybody here?  Obviously, I would have given this casino 1 star, but due to the sweet Coke machine, it gets upgraded to 2.

When I was introduced to this Vietnamese restaurant last year, it was hard to forget. The restaurant is clean, service is friendly, and food is awesome! Oh, and how could I forget the extremely reasonable prices? The only complaint I have is that they don't have a website...but I'll try to remember what I've had!  We usually start with the fresh spring rolls. They aren't anything special, but the peanut dipping sauce...mmmm. I could eat that by the spoon if it came in a jar!  The pho is near perfect in my books. It's a huge portion, and the broth is well seasoned- I can't stand it when I order pho and it comes with what tastes like chicken broth. If I wanted chicken noodle soup I could open a can! There is a good ratio of noodles to broth, and there has a decent amount of meat. You can't go wrong ordering pho here.  The last time I was here, I tried some sort of chicken curry "soup" that came with the option of noodles or bread (we opted for the noodles). It was excellent but very spicy. However, that didn't keep me from eating more and more; in fact, it was near impossible to stop eating. It'll be hard to pass that down when returning to Pho Van for my fix of pho!  It's hard not to give Pho Van 5 stars, but I'll have to stick with 4 for now.

I wish more restaurants could be like this. We came here for brunch this weekend and enjoyed everything about this place! The service is top notch, more healthy options than not, VERY reasonable prices, and fresh ingredients. What more could you ask for?  The place was shockingly empty at around 10am Saturday morning, but that just meant faster service for us! We were pretty hungry so opted to split the banana, espresso, pistachio, date muffin. It was the just the right size and oh so delicious. I need to figure out how to make those suckers!  I shared the huevos rancheros and the market vegetable scramble. What a perfect combo! The scramble was chock full of veggies and laid on top of a sweet potato hash (basically some finely diced sweet potatoes that seemed to have been saut√©ed. The huevos was two sunny side up eggs on top of corn tortillas and served with a side of freshly made salsa. There was a light sprinkling of cheese but just enough to see. The spice from the salsa was not too heavy and worked well with the ranchero sauce. I was surprised not to see a side of beans or something. Regardless, it was really good.  We decided to try a quinoa Johnny cake because the server was telling us how good they were. He wasn't kidding. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was plenty big and I couldn't even tell there was quinoa in it...it tasted just like a pancake! On top was a decent sized dollop of Greek yogurt and a few fresh blueberries.  I left stuffed but not in a food coma like way, like i would have felt eating breakfast out somewhere else. I would definitely return for brunch and can't wait to try lunch or dinner there! This restaurant proves you can eat really good food that's HEALTHY! And you can watch them prepare the food from your table to prove it!

This is my parent's favorite froyo place, and with a pretty convenient location, we tend to automatically go to Kokomo when we want frozen yogurt. The atmosphere is fun, with a modern vibe and the frozen yogurt is pretty good. While I usually have to taste all the flavors they have (gotta weigh my options!), I tend to only find a few that are above average and worth making it into my cup. They also have the typical toppings you'd expect. Prices are consistent with other local frozen yogurt places.

I honestly don't know how this place could get one bad review. After discovering Yogurtland on a recent trip to LA, I was so excited to see there was one in Chandler. It's officially my fav froyo place. They have so many unique flavors that can't be found anywhere else, and I can always count on taro being there! There are a lot of flavors in the rotation, so everybody is bound to find something they like (although I challenge you to find one you DON'T like). Even better- it's a little cheaper than a few others around!  Now all they need is a rewards program...

Coming from a city who has some of the best ice cream in the country (aka Jeni's), I have high standards when it comes to this cool treat. When I heard about Paletas Betty I knew I had to try it, as the flavors and concept reminded me a lot of Jeni's. While at the Chandler farmer's market last week, they had a stand there and I couldn't pass down the opportunity to taste one...even if it was right before going to dinner!  They only had 4 options at their cart that day, but I went with the calabaza (creamy pumpkin pie) because I'm a sucker for anything pumpkin. It was absolutely delicious and refreshing on the hot day it was. Nice and creamy, with the perfect amount of pumpkin flavor that wasn't overpowering. They offer a lot of other unique flavors that I can't wait to go back and taste...this might be added to the "must go" list when I'm in town!

My parents took me here for lunch on my recent visit because they were offering special $4 gyros and they said they were really good. Apparently a lot of others got the text about the special too, as the place was pretty busy! They seem to know how to control the lunch crowd- the line went pretty quick. We ordered 3 to go and went home to eat them.  These gyros were VERY good. The pita was warm, soft and fluffy. There was crisp leafy green lettuce and a diced cucumber/tomato mixture in it that I wish I could have had as a side! The meat was very flavorful and not too greasy, which I appreciated. The gyro was big enough for my dad and I to split (we weren't extremely hungry), but one would definitely fill you up.  I would love to return to Cyprus Grill to try an entree...if their other food is as good as the gyro, this place could be dangerous!

This restaurant came highly recommended by a couple of friends, so when I was in town I suggested we come here to celebrate my mom's birthday. Upon pulling up, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was a cute little house with tables on the front patio.   As we walked in, we were asked if we wanted to sit on the back patio, which apparently is the most requested- and now I see why! The entire back patio was full tables and umbrellas. Tall trees hung overhead, and there was relaxing music playing quietly in the background...it was the perfect atmosphere for an afternoon lunch.  My mom and I split the strawberry chicken salad and the chicken, wild mushroom and leek crepes. It was a good balance, as the salad was a little plain on it's own-  but was full of the most DELICIOUS strawberries I've EVER eaten.   The crepes were not exactly what I expected, but they were mouth watering- not one complaint! The crepe wasn't your typical shape and had a crispy outside. I couldn't get enough of the filling! The chicken, wild mushroom, and leek mixture was just too good. The basil beurre blanc was a nice touch but not even needed. Ask for a side of their homemade bread (which is only available upon request) to help soak up the extra sauce.  It was a perfect birthday brunch for my mom, who can't wait to come back...and it may be come a special request for every time I come to visit! The atmosphere was relaxing, the service was wonderful, and the food was delicious. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the mouth watering items on the menu!

After lunching at Arcadia Farms, we decided to take a walk, as we heard the Marketplace where they sell their baked goods was not too far. Little did we know, all we had to do was cross the street!  Arcadia Farms Marketplace has several pre-made sandwiches and salads to choose from if you want to pick up a quick lunch. The case is full of some scrumptious looking baked goods, which I will definitely need to save room for next time!  We didn't buy anything this time, since we had just eaten, but what a convenient little place to pick up a quick yummy meal...and even better, most items are a few $$ less than on the menu across the street!

I stumbled upon Modern Mommy Boutique after a trip for "something cold" a few doors down. I needed to find a gift for a baby shower, so I'm glad I blindly found this store! Upon walking in, I noticed the cute and super soft clothes. After I walked around a bit more, I realized they had everything you could possibly think of and more for a  newborn (or older) baby! I also noticed a huge wall full of nursing bras. Whether your a new mom (or to-be) or shopping for a gift, you will surely be able to find something here!

I heard there was a new froyo place around and started researching so I could make a visit. I wasn't sure if Yollipop was going to be anything special since it didn't have many reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised- in fact, it may just be my favorite frozen yogurt place (that says a lot)!  You won't see Yollipop if you're just driving around; it's hidden in the corner of The Falls at Ocotillo, right around the corner from Paradise Bakery, Keegans, and Pei Wei (make sure to save room for dessert here after your lunch/dinner at one of these restaurants!). It may take a little searching to find, but it's well worth it, I promise.  Upon walking in, a friendly employee greets you and introduces you to what they have to offer. Usually I find the "introductions" annoying, but this one is actually helpful, so listen well- especially if you plan on sampling. Make sure they tell you how to get the froyo into the sample cups without getting it all over yourself...it takes some practice!  Now onto the frozen yogurt- there are multiple flavor choices, which I like. All of their flavors are homemade, and they offer sugar free, gluten free, lactose free, AND fat free options. This will surely accommodate all of those with health concerns/allergies! There were so many good flavors, it was hard to narrow down to what I was going to fill my cup with! However, they do have taro which is my absolute favorite flavor and impossible to find anywhere else, so they'll definitely be seeing me again (and again)!  Next, onto the toppings. They must have around 50 different toppings to choose from. More than I've ever see at any other frozen yogurt place. I'm personally not a toppings person, but I was impressed by the number of options.   When you check out, make sure to give them your phone number. That's right, no more loyalty cards to lose in your wallet or attach to your keys. This is nice and easy. Each time you go, they give you a percentage of what you spend (I can't remember they exact number). You can then turn around and spend your accumulated amount whenever you want! As mentioned in another review, it is $0.39 and ounce, but as far as I know that is what all the other frozen yogurt places around charge, so I don't think this is pricey at all...  Check this place out. Between the multiple flavor and topping options, along with the friendly employees, you won't be disappointed!

My friends have been raving about Pita Jungle forever. I don't know how it's taken me so long to get here! We went for happy hour recently and ordered quite the spread...how can you not when everything is less than $3?!  The hummus trio ($1) was much less than expected but nonetheless, really good. It was basically a teaspoon of each hummus; even our server agreed it was very little and brought us a second. The jalapeno was my favorite. The baba ganoosh ($1) was soooo good- and there was plenty of that to go around- although I may have eaten most of it myself! We enjoyed the dolmades (2 for $2), and the falafel (2 for $1 were delicious). I ordered the garlic lemon chicken ($2) for myself, and had to shoo away random forks that kept landing it in- it was a very generous portion, so I was nice enough to share a few pieces. Other than the happy hour dishes we ordered, we got a cup of the cocunut curry soup (?) which did not disappoint- in fact, it was so good, we got a second cup!  The restaurant itself is quite large inside, but opted to sit outside. The patio is also a nice size and is shaded, which was perfect on this unusually hot winter day.  Happy hour is definitely worth the trip, and I can't wait to come back and try some of the amazing looking salads and pitas I saw!

Simply put, this store is amazing. Stylish, classy, and comfortable clothing at VERY reasonable prices. They have a lot of workout gear, in addition to everyday clothing. My parents sent me several things from here for my birthday last month, and my mom wanted to take me on my recent visit since I loved everything they sent. They had a great sale going on, and I can tell you I did not leave empty handed (good thing I had half of an empty suitcase to fill)!! All of the clothing sold here is incredibly comfortable and is good for the young and not-so-young. The employees are super friendly and give honest opinions on what looks good- or not.  I hope they open more of these stores across the country!

Cute name, cute store, and cute, moist, DELICIOUS bundt cakes...nothing more could make me happier! I found out about Nothing Bundt Cakes when my cousin picked out a lemon cake with cream cheese icing for a family gathering. Not only is that one of my favorite cake combinations, but it was one of the best cakes I have ever eaten. It was incredibly moist and very addicting- I could not stop going back for more!  You MUST try a bundt cake from here; you don't know what you're missing! They even have small bundtlets so you can enjoy a single size bundt cake!
