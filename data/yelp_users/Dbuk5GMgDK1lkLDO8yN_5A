All you can eat greens.  Get your rabbit on here!  To put my review in context, I love Sweet Tomatoes.  So it wouldn't bother me if one food container is spilling or if the cabbage isn't the freshest.   I just wouldn't eat cabbage that day.  There are so many options (and 2 sides to the salad bar!).  Super delicious, healthy lunch for around $10.

Been here twice.  First time they were out of everything I wanted on the menu.  Granola on the yogurt parfait was soggy.  The staff is so grumpy... they need some sleep.  Skip this place if you want some food at PHX.
