The other reviews are pretty accurate.  These guys don't take the time to do anything more than push the dirt around.  Definitely won't be going back here.

Don't go on Taco Tuesday.  Stood in line for 15 minutes and then waited 30 minutes for our order.  They couldn't handle the volume and were more focused on the phone orders (you could see the orders piling up on the back counter) than the 15 customers standing in front of them waiting for their food.

Let me start by saying that I love playing golf and I have probably played nearly 50 different tracks in AZ. I love playing at Dobson Ranch, it is a great course. For the money, it doesn't get much better.   The reason why I am giving them one star is pure and simple because of customer service. The guys that work in the pro shop are ridiculously rude, every time, no exceptions. I called to try and set up a tournament for my work with over 50 players. The total cost was going to exceed $60!!! That included the round, range balls, lunch and a gift card of some sort, plus the ridiculous $1 cart fee. It didn't matter if we didn't want lunch or the gift card, it was non negotiable.  This was more expensive that courses such as Legacy, The Raven and The Foothills.    For someone who works in the customer service industry, there is nothing more important that treating customers the right way and Dobson Ranch failed miserably in my book.

I live right down the street from Western Skies and played it quite often in my early golfing years (18-22) and found it as an OK course then.  It is wide open, so even if you spray it off the tee, its no big deal.  Its relatively cheap in the summer, but there are better deals.  In the winter, I won't go near the course, too overpriced.  However, as I have grown in my game, I find Western Skies to be sub par in many areas.  Worst bunkers in all of golf.  If, and that is a big IF, there is any sand in the bunkers it is rock hard.  The grass is patchy at best and never in good shape.  The fairways are rock hard and I would have to agree that the greens are extremely inconsistent.  If you read my other post about Dobson Ranch, you will know the other thing I covet is great customer service.  When I come into the clubhouse to complain that a round of golf took 6 hours, I don't want to hear excuses, I want apologies.  Western Skies usually books tee times ever 7 minutes as opposed to the standard 8 or even 9.  The rangers are never out on the course and they over book their tournaments.  This is just another course where the primary concern is not how can we provide a world class golfing experience, but how can we get one extra group on so we can make a few more dollars.  Needless to say, I haven't played this track in years and have no plans on doing so in the near future.

I mother effin love this place.  I have been eating there since they opened back in 2000 or 2001.    The breakfast burritos are the bomb, the california carne asada is unbelievable and the rolled tacos are always good.  The staff is always nice.  I love seeing this place packed, they deserve it.

My dog, Kahuna, absolutely loves this place.  He is a yellow lab and as if that weren't enough, being named Kahuna you can imagine how much he loves the water.  He loves jumping off the dock after his tennis balls.    I would have to agree that if there were more shade and grass, it would make it even that much better, but its hard to complain.    I have never had any problems with other dogs at the park and the owners seem to be with it for the most part.  No real complaints here, you can see Kahuna jumping off the dock just about every weekend.

I am actually giving Boston's a 2.5 Star rating here, let me tell you why.  While the food isn't the best I've had, its pretty darn good and its reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is good and its usually not that busy.  The one consistent problem I have here, is the service.  They are slow and half the times I've been there it seems as if they forget they have tables to service.    I sat in the bar a couple of Friday's ago at about 6 pm while waiting for some friends.  I grabbed a booth (it was seat yourself) and three different waitresses walked by my table multiple times without acknowledging me.  Once my friends arrived, our waitress promptly asked if we had been served yet and took our orders.  Our food was good, but slow to come out.  Our drinks were cold, but slow to be refilled.  Come on Boston's!!!!! You can do better than this!  Update:  And they've gone out of business... not surprising.

I love this place! Great food and "It's always a beautiful day at Chik-Fil-A"!!  I love that every time I go through the drive thru, they give my dog a dog biscuit.

OHHHHHHHHHH BABY!!!! I love me some InNOut Burger.  Growing up in Arizona we didn't have InNOut Burger, so when we went to So Cal to visit family, the daily trips to InNOut were like mini vacations within our vacation.  You can imagine how happy I was when they started opening them in the Valley.  I absolutely love this place.  Try something off the secret menu.  3x3, 4x4, animal style, well done fries... grilled cheese! yup!  The service is always good, the restaurants are always clean, and the food is always fresh.  Can't ask for much more.

My truck needed to be washed inside and out in a bad way.  I have a yellow lab that rides in my truck every day and sheds his hair horribly.  I dropped my truck off at 7:30 am to do inside detail with a wash and wax.  I was so happy with the results.  For the money I paid, I couldn't have asked for much more.  They shampooed the floors and seats and got 98% of the dog hair out.   It was a little pricey, but they were able to do the detail, an oil change and a radiator flush for $170 out the door.  Well done fellas!  You have earned repeat business from me and my family.
