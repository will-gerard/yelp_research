I've been to a lot of nail salons and know exactly what kind of service I want from my tech. I am a perpetual walk-in. I never make an appointment and I don't like to wait. When I come here, I always receive a friendly greeting and never have to wait more than 5-10 minutes to receive service.   I almost don't want to share this great review, because I want to keep Kevin all to myself, but they deserve the high rating. He is fast and does a great job. Even with a back-fill on my pink & whites, he's done in less than 30 min. He's not the kind of nail tech that has to add little bits of acrylic over and over to even things out, and he makes my nails thin enough to look natural but thick enough they don't crack or break. My cuticles are carefully cared for - never been hurt once by the drill. (none of those "oops" situations where your nail is burning hot or your cuticle is left torn & bloody!) My nails are even, sharp, and no bulky build up.  The pedicures are decent, too. They keep the tubs super clean, don't wash/float the tools in the water (gross!) and are reasonably priced. No pushy nail tech trying to upsell you into nail design, callous remover, etc. The deluxe pedi is $30 and includes everything I need. The leg/foot massage is basic, not great, but still relaxing. It's more about getting your feet looking pretty again, than a spa-like massage. Overall, I'm very happy with City Nails. I've left once to try another and was sadly disappointed. Not again. This is my go-to place.

Love Hippie Gypsy! Cute clothes, that you wouldn't find in chain stores. Lots of tie dye, matchstick skirts, peasant tops, paisley designs, hats, etc. Stuff for guys, too. Yes, it's a smoke shop, but that's in the back of the store, so even if you're not into that there's plenty of unique jewelry, clothing, gifts, and fun stuff to look at. The staff is always super nice. One time we walked off and had gone a block down Mill, and saw one of the cashiers running down the street (barefoot! lol) to catch us because we'd left a piece to an incense burner on the counter. I thought that was going above & beyond. Always make it a point to stop in here when I'm browsing around Mill!

Okay, okay...so, we went back, and we were convinced. A couple friends and I were looking for a place to watch Sunday football, and we came here for the first games of the season. It was a quiet morning, but probably just because it was the first game. It has definitely picked up since then.  Justin, the Manager, was kind enough to lure us back with an offer to try the California Carver pizza. Hooked! ! Comes with a spicy southwest sauce, turkey, pepper jack & mozzarella, then topped with pico, avocado & crisp onion strings. You won't be sorry you tried it. We went back the following week and ordered the same thing!  We've gone back a couple times now and it feels like we're visiting with old friends when we come in. Justin, the bartender, is a riot and knows how to keep his customers smiling even when he's got a full bar - plus it helps he's also rooting for DaBears!   The service really has been excellent, everyone is on top of things and makes sure we have everything we need. They probably don't remember this, but I also hosted a dinner for my Meetup group in the private room upstairs a few months ago, and we had great service then too. I was just so busy entertaining, that I didn't get a chance to really talk to the staff that night...but we'll probably host another event here soon!  Thanks Justin1 for convincing us we needed to come back, and Justin2 for making it fun to stay. See you for the next Bears game! ;)

Very fresh sushi. The Rainbow roll is delicious!  Just be prepared to be there awhile,  because the service is not that great. Every time I've eaten here the food comes out late. We ordered spring rolls & gyochi (also delish) as appetizers. They brought out the gyochi which comes with a special house dipping sauce,  but not the spring rolls. We used our dipping trays for that sauce,  Then when our sushi was brought out, the waitress didn't bring clean ones for us to use for soy sauce & wasabi. We waited for her to come back, not able to start digging in...but she never did.  I stopped another waitress & asked her to bring two clean ones,  she brought one.  After completely done with our sushi,  They finally brought the spring rolls we'd ordered as an appetizer. We would have ordered dessert,  but dreaded the wait once again.  Great sushi, rolls are pretty big,  but not the fastest service if you don't have a lot of time.

We were on the Yelp Holiday Scavenger Hunt and stopped in here to have a drink. It's a cute little place, has a few outdoor tables, and good selection of liquor. The bartender seemed bothered that we stopped in to ask if they were participating in the scavenger hunt, and when we sat down to actually give her some business, she seemed more interested in the guys in the band setting up their equipment.   We ordered a couple drinks, that were ok, but the diet soda was on the flat side. When she brought back my debit card & receipt for me to sign, she never even looked at me or thanked me, she actually set MY card on the corner of the bar where she was talking to the guys in the band and walked away. I cocktailed and worked with female bartenders for over 6 yrs. You would be wise to treat your lady customers just as well as your male. We understand the business and tip well to those who deserve it.

The atmosphere is dark, and drip candles flowing down Jameson bottles, light your table. Lots of hipsters, but mostly just relaxed, chill people. The booths are set up as long tables, so you may end up making new friends, if your party is not 12 or more. The bar is usually packed out, and during the cooler months, expect the patio to be the same.   I haven't had a pasty I didn't like, yet. The crusts are thick but flaky. My favorite, by far, is the Spicy Cajun Chicken. The sauce really makes it and adds to the heat! The desserts look delicious, but I am perpetually on a diet, so I only tease myself. If I were to choose one to cheat with, it would definitely be the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Looks gooey sweet!  Great selection of beers and a full bar. Go early to avoid crowds.

This was my first time here and it will be my last.  I came here with a damaged nail on my big toe. I'd been told by everyone before this that I'd hurt it & it would heal. Here they had someone come over to tell me it was a fungus. They then started talking in Vietnamese & started snickering & laughing. This went on for a good 5 min before I looked up & caught one of them by the eyes.  If by the small chance it was not about me, I still find it incredibly rude & tacky to speak in another language the whole time your being paid to service your clients. I also found it gross that she washed the tools used to remove calluses in the water my feet were still in. I would never recommend this salon.

I've only been here once and I'll never go back. Earlier in the day my hands had become swollen and I had forgotten I'd taken off a small diamond ring & left it in the console of my car...didn't realize it was missing until later. So rude! Have some consideration...just because somebody forgot something in their car, they didn't leave it for you!

UPDATE - My daughter went here (after I told her not to - when will they learn??), when she got there she realized a pair of her swimsuit bottoms had fallen out of her bag after swimming at my house. She didn't want to leave them out, so she put them in the glove compartment to avoid anyone taking or touching them. When she drove off she forgot to check if they were there, but sure enough, when she remembered the next day and checked...they were gone! GROSS! What kind of perv takes a woman's swimsuit bottoms? Nasty!  DO NOT GO HERE!!

You always know when you come across someone that loves what they do. After 14+ years in the industry, Blanca's passion for hair styling still shines through in everything she does, and makes it a pleasure to work with. She gets just as excited as you do about your new cut and color, so you can feel safe, knowing she wants to see amazing results too!  I shared a few pics I'd saved on Pinterest to show her, gave her an idea of what I liked and didn't like, and she took it from there. My color turned out just as I expected, with a bright vibrant and fiery red, to match my personality! Ha! :)   Honestly, you will love being in Blanca's chair. She's personable, talented, and makes the time fly by. (Also has great pricing!)

This Smashburger is right up the street from me so I go here often when I can't think of anything to have for dinner... or have a craving for their Arizona burger, which is amazing, with the jalape√±os and guac.    It wasn't much of a wait today but I've been there before where there is a good long line. The wait staff is always very friendly and helpful. My order came out within 5 minutes. I usually get the sweet potato fries but I opted for the regular fries this time, next time I'll stick with the sweet potato.  Because everything is ordered separately it's a little pricier than some burger joints. I paid $9 for hamburger and french fries, but it's worth it because everything is fresh & they're always juicy.

Met some friends here for happy hour and fundraiser. Prices were good & we had great service the whole time we were there. Started out sitting on the patio on a semi-chilly night. The lit up the heaters for us, as soon as they saw us getting cold, and without us asking. It got really windy, so we asked our waitress if we could move inside. She was very helpful and got us a table right away, no attitude about closing out our bills, at all.   The setting both indoors & out is very casual. Love the big open booths with the cushy seating...more like comfy conversation areas. I've heard they take some of the tables out & have dancing there later. We left early, but will have to come back to see what that's all about next time!

Whatever you do, DON'T make your reservation with the hostess. Made a reservation for their private room on Monday morning, for our monthly Meetup dinner on Friday, for a party of 30. She took everything down, said she had it, and that a manager would follow up to get any further details.   The manager, Kevin, called the following day while I was at work and left a voicemail to call him back & touch base. Called again, he wasn't there again. Spoke to Coop, the other manager, and he informed me that the room had already been booked by a private dinner party. He said he didn't know about it, that it must've just come in. Hmm, but MY reservation was made on MONDAY. There was no mention of the possibility of losing my reservation if I didn't call back that day. I was under the assumption the room was ours after making the initial reservation, since that's what was expressed.   After several phone calls, and Coop going back & forth to talk to Kevin (no, Kevin never had the professional courtesy to speak to me himself) , Coop suggested splitting the "private" room with the other party or that they could put US in the lounge. HELLO? I have a Meetup group and this is an "event" not just some dinner party. I'd explained that we need room away from the noise, where we can get up and speak, but said I'd swing by tonight to see if it'd work.    Coop called back again to inform me the ONLY way they could accommodate us, was if I moved my dinner time, because the lounge wouldn't work for us. I asked why they couldn't put the other party in the lounge. He said he'd love to. When I said "Make it happen, then!!"....I think I heard the faint sound of cajones shriveling up. Choke. They were totally unwilling to work with us & save a monthly repeat business customer, with a Meetup group of over 700 ladies in the Phoenix metro area...and growing.  I will NEVER visit this establishment again. Now, on a Weds evening, I have to start a brand new search to accommodate my party of 30 women all expecting to be at Coach & Willie's on Friday night. It was also one of the lady's birthdays, so we were planning on sticking around a bit to party, too. Lots of bar tabs you just missed out on. Your bartenders and servers thank you, Kevin.

I originally came to Body Renewal from a BuyWithMe voucher.  I've been back 3 times since then because my therapist is the by far the best I've ever had. Tony makes you feel very relaxed from the start. Although the studio is quite small, it is decorated & lit in a way to provide a calming & peaceful ambiance to go along with the soft music in the background.   Tony is professional and courteous. He takes his time and knew to pay attention to where all my tension was built up without me saying a word. I like that he also used several methods of both massaging & stretching the muscles.  Very relaxing.    I almost want to keep it a secret so he doesn't get too busy for me. Either way, it's worth the wait.

Always so yummy! Love the Annihilator, but a little sweet, so I get half the syrup and sometimes throw in an extra shot of espresso. Delish! The baristas are perky and friendly. I'm not a morning person, so it's a struggle to return that energy sometimes, but appreciated none the less.

Went here today because of a Groupon deal I saw for a $20 Deluxe pedicure, but as it turns out they have the same deal painted on the window so you don't need to actually buy the Groupon to get the deal.   I called ahead to make sure there would be no wait and to see how much they charged for a backfill on pink and white acrylics. I was told the back is $35 so I asked how much is a full set and he said 40.. which i think is a little ridiculous to pay $35 for a fill when you can get a brand new full set for $40. I needed a new set so I decided to go that route.  He wasn't wrong about there being no wait. I was the only one in the salon on a Saturday afternoon. That should have been my first clue. They sat me in the chair far in back, closest to the sinks and the bathrooms. Which didn't turn out to be such a great location, because I could hear one of the other nail stylists in the bathroom, hacking and throwing up, the entire time I sat in the chair. Eww.  I was looking forward to a relaxing chair massage while I got my pedicure, but instead they decided to have two girls work on me at one time, to remove my acrylics while I got my pedicure. This is a pet peeve of mine. I come in there to relax and instead I had to twist and turn to put myself in uncomfortable positions for her to reach my nails,  instead of sitting at a table in front of her after my pedicure was complete. I ended up walking out with more back pain than when I walked in.  The stylist removing my old set seemed annoyed and grumpy the entire time, often letting out heavy sighs as she was working to remove them. One of my nails have gotten water under it and had become begun separating from my finger and she said it was a fungus (although there was no discoloration at all) but did not offer to put any medication on it as other salons normally would have. Instead she told me to go buy it at Sally's.   She got all the nails off and put the new ones on and after looking at them I could see that the white tips of acrylic were lopsided on a couple fingers,  probably because of the way I was sitting in that chair,  with her off on the side, so my hands were not straight in front of her. She argued with me about them being lopsided and I stood my ground because it looked like they were slanted across my nail. She came up with a bunch of different excuses of why it was that way because she didn't want to have to fix it but I persisted. She also made the nail that had been separated much shorter than the rest and said it was because of the fungus, then when I told her that didn't make sense,  & should have just made the tip longer, she said it was because that nail bed was shorter than the others. NOT.   I had her fix all of them even with all the arguing, and walked out with halfway decent looking nails, after dealing with attitude. Not a pleasant experience at all or in any way.. I hope others will leave reviews about nail salons when they have bad experiences like this to save us all from having to go through snotty attitude and poor service that we pay for.

I  bought a discounted membership to Fill-a-Seat through Groupon. I'm thankful I at least didn't pay full price for a membership I have yet to use ONCE. They don't let you see what events are going to be available before you purchase, so you really have no clue until you buy the membership as to what kind of shows you'll have access to. There's usually 5-8 choices, but they are all shows that I would never go see, even for free. Comedy shows at Iguana Mack's? I could get in there anytime without paying for some "exclusive" membership. Other shows include Rage in the Cage or Phoenix symphony (but good luck trying to be the one to score those!). That's really been the only choices. Don't waste your money.

This was my first year participating in the New Belgium Tour de Fat parade, and it will definitely NOT be my last! I went with 3 friends and we were all pretty impressed with the turnout! There are quite a few road blocks (obviously) that you'll have to maneuver around if you're driving in vs biking. I parked in the ASU Sun Devils covered stadium parking lot on Rio Salado, and rode over to Ash. It took me less than 10min, so I'll probably make that my go-to parking for upcoming years!   The parade was full of crazy and outrageous costume peeps and bikes! All kinds of bikes turned out, from cruisers to choppers, to unicycles, and everything in between. The ride through Tempe's neighborhood back streets was fun, too. Residents sat out front of their homes watching the tour, and many dressed up themselves (my fave was the guy dressed as a big nut sack LOL!) or played music for us as we rode by.  Back at the festival, it seemed like the stream of bikers coming in the gate would never end! Lots of music, beer, and good times inside the gates. The only thing missing was COLD WATER!! October may be cooler weather in other parts of the country, but we're still rocking the high 90's in AZ! More cold water next year, please!! That's my only reason for not giving 5 stars.  Definitely a must-do with friends and family every year. Can't wait for the next one! :)

This is a little gem tucked away in an established Tempe neighborhood that you'd never expect to be there. I've driven by a few times and saw lots of cars parked outside, but thought it was a private club. When a friend asked me to meet her there for happy hour, I jumped at the chance.   It's a gorgeous setting on the lake. We sat on the patio and watched the sun set while enjoying a glass of wine. (all wine & craft beer 50% ALL day on Monday!) You'll see a few neighborhood boaters wave as they float by on their little electric boats. If you want to join them, there's a boat ride that's only $5, that you pay for inside.   We both had salads that were delicious and fresh. They don't skimp on any of the goodies either (candied pecans..yum!). The service was prompt and courteous. There was a mix of older & younger generations. All seemed welcome and treated equally. Very nice place, and I definitely plan to go many more times, since it's less than 5 min from home!

Went here with my nephew who was in from out of town because I'd had fun here before. We had a two drinks each, shared some chips & salsa, and 3 street tacos. Walked out of there spending nearly $70 on a very small lunch. The chips come with 3 different salsas, but they are not free like other Mexican restaurants, The tacos are decent, but overall, this place is a little pricey.   I don't think the bartender smiled once, although she was nice enough to tell my nephew that old town Scottsdale is the place to hang out. THAT kind of explains the non-existant smile on the pretty little blonde's face the entire time. Probably won't go back here again unless it's HH, because they do have their house margaritas for half-price ($5).
