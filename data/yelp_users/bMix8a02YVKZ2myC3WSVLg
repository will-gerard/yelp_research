After a horrible experience at the Crepe place next door, we ran in and had a some great food. Nice staff, good prices, food and service!

Amazing! This is literally my Go-To spot for every occasion. I work across the street and come in way too often and decided to finally write a review. Don't be scared! Your wait staff will tell you everything you need to know about the menu. I recommend the kale salad with steak please! No bread just cheese . If your not a heal freak, the tacos are great, the chicken sausage pizza and lastly, I highly recommend the spaghetti squash casserole with chicken or steak... So good! Please don't ever go away! #TFK4LIFE

No substitutions!?!?! Your telling me I can't get a side of turkey with my omelet? Or add a buckwheat crepe instead of wheat because the flavors won't taste the same? You have got to be kidding me. I left and will not be back.

I just purchased a home though The House team and they were amazingly efficient! We even closed early! I needed to get into a place as soon as possible and had been looking for the right home for over a year! Finally found a great deal and they quickly processed everything during the holidays. Thank you all so much for all your hard work! You will be getting all my referrals!  Excellent customer service and professional staff made my first time home buying experience easy and stress free. Thanks again!
