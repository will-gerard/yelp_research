Went here for the first time recently with a friend who mentioned it! I had never heard of it before, but then again I don't live in Mesa.  We initially went here to get breakfast since I love breakfast places, but both of us ended up getting lunch. I got a hamburger and it was great, but my only complaint is that the bun was dry. Which is a big no no with burgers, cause if the bun is dry, the whole thing crumbles apart, so hence the minus one star. The fries were freaking delicious though! Great service, too.  They should do a Groupon! I would buy it!

My 2nd time at BJ's was last week. This is a busy business, but has adequate seating between the bar, the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night, but definitely worth it.  Sometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook, which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes, but also a pain because you want to eat everything, as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good, too!   Another great thing is the dessert menu, which has a lot of good options, especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here: http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/menus/desserts). Opted for the Baked Beignet, but they were out of it, so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious. I joined their rewards club and always get e-mails for deals, so I suggest signing up, it's worth it! Cannot wait to go back, just wish it was closer to my place!

I do usually like this store for last minute gifts, even though it's pretty pricey especially compared to online (and they do NOT price match Amazon), but today they made me leave upset today.  I bought two of the same items. The tags read $12.95, but there is no signage on the display that showed a price for this specific item. There are other items on the same rack had display tags with a lower price. When I went to check out with cashier named Vivian M., I asked her if they rang out at $12.95 (MY MISTAKE, apparently!), just in case they were cheaper and she said, "no...9.95". I said maybe they are on sale? She said, "no they're not". She preceded to change the price back up to 12.95, even though they rang out for less. i'm not trying to whine over a couple of dollars for the sake of complaining, but this comes down to pure bad customer service. I asked her, "so if I would not have said anything, you wouldn't of even noticed" and she said yes I would of. No, she wouldn't of. How would she know they were 12.95 had I not verbally asked her?  I went to the customer service lady towards the back of the store, who was much nicer, but after going back up front, she said sorry and that they were $12.95. I've worked retail long enough to know that when something scans with that price, that is the price you give to the customer. I know about weights and measures, and I know some tags get mixed up with others, but this was actually the tag for this item and their mistake shouldn't cost the customer. Giving me both items for $9.95 instead of $12.95 wouldn't have made B&N go under. It would of ensured that they had a happy customer that would return to make more purchases in the future.  Very upset with this store and I won't be coming back if they won't stand by the prices that ring out at the register. It's no wonder they have an F on the BBB website.

I've been to several Streets locations over the years and I've never had a bad experience. I'm picking this one to rate because I've been coming here a lot more lately.  It seems the service is different each time we come. Sometimes they give free bread with sauce, which is a lovely starter while we wait for yummy pizza. We usually come at night and they are always attentive and never get our order wrong.   Today our lunch lacked in service. Our waitress never came around to the table, she never brought us bread. We literally watched this woman bring bread to every table around us, but skip us, it was so weird. A nice man who is usually there finally brought us some after he noticed the woman kept skipping our table. I had to get up to ask someone for our check as well. It happens!  Regardless of today's lackluster service, I do loveee the pizza. Great crust, which is a must for me! I'll still come back for as long as they are open. Also would love more e-club coupons. These days I find myself only going to businesses that send out coupons.

As someone else also wrote on here, I'm only giving them one star because zero stars is not an option. Seriously heed my advice and DO NOT COME HERE. They mark up the prices on everything you mail or purchase. From stamps to first class postage! I shipped something at an actual USPS location and it cost about $2.40 for a first class package. Here, she charged me $4.00 for the exact same kind of package! Come here only if you're desperate to ship and don't mind being ripped off. I'm never coming here again. Seriously, they only stay in business by ripping off the customer. Another example...a sheet of stamps that you can get at the post office or grocery store are less than here.  Also, the lady who owns it is rude and unwelcoming.  I'd rather see an honest business in this building.

I've only been to this location, so I can't speak for any others. I absolutely love their salads. I can make mine the way I like it and it's super good. I have ordered the exact same type from Paradise Bakery and I can say that I'd rather eat Wildflower's each time if given the choice. Always comes with yummy bread that tastes so good with the dressing. They also have a lovely section of baked goods and breakfast foods. Really nice atmosphere and everyone is super nice to me. I love to call in my order and pick it up. Only time I had a problem was when someone put cheese on my salad and they not only re-made it for me, but the manager gave me a giftcard, I love this place, just wish it was cheaper! Still highly recommend. I hope to try their pasta's soon, but they are only available after a certain time so I cannot comment on that yet :)

I have been here probably half a dozen times in the past and I remember liking it. I chose this place for a special day since it was on OpenTable and I was looking for reservations which was nice and convenient on a "holiday". However, after Mother's Day I'm never coming here again.   First off everything is family size now so you cannot order a meal for yourself. You must share with someone else or with many other people. Horrible business model but I'm sure they love it since for just four people it cost over $80 bucks. What a ripoff for an app, chicken and a bowl of pasta. A tiny tray of calamari was $14 and it wasn't as good as other places. Also they had ran out of basil which was a bummer.  Next, the service was severely lacking. our server was extremely inattentive, would ignore requests when we tried to get his attention. He would look at us, wave and go in the other direction. He constantly forgot to bring us drink/water refills, food/bread/sides, seasoning, etc.. after we had kindly asked. We had empty glasses for over 15 minutes.   The worst part though was when the kitchen undercooked the chicken limone. By the time they recooked it, I had already finished my meal and my mom had lost her appetite. Great way to ruin mother's day dinner! there are dozens of better places in old town and Scottsdale in general. Going to avoid this place from now on.

Born and raised in AZ, I've been to a lot of pizza places. I love trying out new pizza places and I'm thankful to live in Scottsdale, where my favorite pizza place lives. Grimaldi's is unlike any pizza I've ever had from anywhere in the valley. And yes, I've been to New York City and had their pizza. I'd pick Grimaldi's pizza over NYC pizza anyday. We've always had fantastic waiter's each time we go and I don't think we've ever had to wait. Parking in Old Town can be really bad at times, but we've never had to park far away either. It's always been a perfect experience. In comparison to say, Olive Garden, it's cheaper! I would recommend Grimaldi's to anyone in AZ, or visiting AZ. There are more locations in the valley and I haven't tried the others, but I'm guessing it's just as good. I haven't been hungry enough after chowing down on pizza to try any of the desserts, but one of these days I'm going to try their cannoli's.  This is spoken from someone who is 100% Italian. I'm choosing Patsy Grimaldi's for my Valentine's Day dinner spot!

I've only been to Frances once and I really liked it, but I didn't buy anything because it's way too expensive for me. It's got tons of cute vintage looks, kind of like Anthropologie. They have a lot of jewelry and cute decor. I look forward to the time when I can go in and actually buy something! Hopefully they have a sale section :)

I love breakfast foods. It's easy to make pancakes, eggs, and bacon at home, but it's fun to go out every once in a while and get something different. I love their whole wheat pancakes. I got strawberry pancakes with eggs and bacon with orange juice. The strawberries were delicious, and they topped the pancakes with lots of whipped cream. Amazing. They also have protein pancakes.  My boyfriend did mention that the coffee wasn't great, but compared to a similar breakfast restaurant (ahem, The Good Egg), it wasn't good there, either. So he didn't hold it against them. He had blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon and he loved it. Even so far as to say that the food was better, albeit more expensive at U.S. Egg.  Also, for a Saturday morning/early afternoon, we were seated right away and our food came out super quickly. All around great service as well.  I will always come back, but not as often as I'd like because our bill was $24. Ouch! Only giving it 4/5 stars because it's more expensive than the competitors. If I could, I'd give it 4.5! :)

Needless to say I was not surprised upon seeing 2.5 stars when I looked this location up on Yelp today! I live in Scottsdale, but my dog was at a vet in the area and I needed something to eat in the meantime. I picked this place because I enjoy a good burger and fries and I know this place has been around for a long time. I haven't been here in probably 10-15 years though. The food was just OK, but the service was awful. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.  I asked for a water with lemon. We put in our order but he didn't bring me a water until almost 10 minutes later. When we put our order in, we also asked for the 1/2 fries/rings combo that they offer. When the food finally came out, they didn't bring our rings/fries. Our waiter disappeared so I couldn't ask him where they were. Also, they never gave us any utensils or napkins. I tried to get the attention of a girl who was serving the table next to us, but she continuously ignored me. We were almost done with our food when I went to find the general manager, who was very nice, but looked like he was 16. Told him we never got our sides or any napkins with our meal and he made sure they finally came out, but we were almost done with the food. The burger was boring. Nothing compared to the delicious burgers elsewhere (I.e. Habit, Portillos). the fries were eh.  the rings were alright, a little too thick for my rings preference. My mom enjoyed her grilled cheese sandwich. The plain fact is that our waiter ignored us most of the time when it wasn't even busy.    When we got our bill, they left the rings/fries combo on there which was about $4. My mom asked the manager if he would take them off since we got them way late. Our server said he thinks there was a mix-up and they gave our side dish to someone else. EVEN if that was the case, it doesn't take a lot of time to put a couple of fries and onion rings on a small plate and toss it on the table. Yeesh.  Not ever coming back here. Only good part was the GM who was very nice and took care of our requests. Waste of money and my taste buds deserve better.

This was my first time at the Golden Spoon, ever! I'm used to going to the other frozen yogurt places, so I didn't even know this existed until I drove by it. I went in thinking it was self serve (like the others) but there's actually someone behind the counter getting it for you, and applying the toppings themselves, which is alright, but I prefer putting my own on for some reason. I thought it was great how they had a lot of different cup sizes and cones. I usually get something strawberry related, but they didn't have anything like that, so I tried the cake batter with fresh cut strawberries and it was actually really good. I also thought the small that I got was a lot! Which is nice to know you're getting your moneys worth.  The employee working was very honest with his customers when someone asked if other frozen yogurt businesses are hurting his business. He said that yes, they are, but at least people are eating yogurt! I will definitely go back and I hope they have different flavors next time. but I still won't stop going to the self serve yogurt places, because sometimes it's fun to mix them and do things yourself. It's all yummy!  Also, he said the Golden Spoon makes their own yogurt and it has more actual yogurt in it than the other places. My favorite froyo place in the valley!

If I was writing this review in October of 2010, I probably would of given this place four stars. Fast forward to now after my second visit, boy has this place gone downhill.  The very first time I came here with my boyfriend, we had a Groupon ($15 for a $30 gift card). He enjoyed his meal, I enjoyed my burger. The burger was delicious and the fries are GREAT. We like the huge TV for football games, and I like when they play country music. We had a few dollars leftover so we got a dessert. They were 'out' of the one I wanted, so I had to get something I didn't really like, but it was still good. Last month we came here again because I got a coupon from LocalDines.com, (another $15 for $30 coupon) and my boyfriend tried something new. He thought it was alright. I had the same thing, a burger and fries. While the fries were delicious, the bun was SUPER dry. It was so gross and pretty much falling apart. I could barely even finish half of it because it wouldn't stay in one piece. We still had some leftover so we got a dessert. We got a cheesecake which turned out to be $7 or $8! What the heck? Shouldn't be that expensive for something so silly. It's cheesecake! Not fondue or something.   The top off comes next. We got our bill, and we were charged 18% gratuity for a party of 2. We had to wait FOREVER for our waitress, who I ended up having to get out of my booth and flag down when it wasn't busy at all. She said that is what the coupon stated, so we said okay, that's fine, not her fault. But then my boyfriend says that he isn't going to give her an extra tip if the tip is already included from the gratuity, and she said, "I wasn't asking you to" in the rudest way possible. You can bet your bottom dollar we didn't give her an extra tip, especially after having to pay all that extra for gratuity. So 2 stars for okay food, rude/lazy employees, overpriced food and extremely overpriced/bad selection of desserts.   Also, like other reviewers have stated, it's overpriced. Go to Chili's instead.

Everything was so delicious here for my first ever visit. The complimentary buttery rolls are huge and I had to force myself to not eat more than two because they are so good. My BBQ ribs fell off the bone and tasted great and fresh. I swear they put cinnamon and sugar on the sweet potato fries because they tasted incredible. even the broccoli tasted amazing! Dipped in some kind of lemon pepper sauce. I was impressed! They took two coupons and we even got a free dessert for a birthday. It can be a little pricey depending on what you get so I wouldn't come back without a coupon, but I'm just cheap like that. They have big screen TVs and a fun country/bar atmosphere. I like throwing peanuts on the ground.

Today was my first visit to this establishment. I thought it was a breakfast-only type place, so when I saw they were open during the late afternoon I was pleased. Got a great parking spot and we were seated right away. It was also randomly happy hour, and the burgers were $2 off. Got a delicious burger with super tasty waffle fries. Love the pretzel bun!! I was stuffed by the end. Didn't have any issues at all. Staff were all very friendly. Would love to try breakfast here! Can't wait to come back and bring the boyfriend next time.

I admit that I've been to this tiny plaza dozens of times and never even knew this place existed, walking right past it many times while going to Stinkweeds. I honestly walked in thinking it was a actually mostly a candy shop, not more of a novelty shop, but I really liked it either way. I didn't buy anything, but next time I'm going gift shopping, I'm definitely going to stop in. I thought the bags of candy that were $4 were priced a little high for such small bags, but you can fill your own little box, which is great. It's definitely a cute store and I say support your local businesses and stop in!

What can I say about Five Guys other than I'm so glad it finally made its way to Arizona. The burger is tasty, the fries are delicious, and it's super close to my house. My only beef with this place (haha get it..) is that it's pretty expensive for 2 people. For my boyfriend and I, it came out to almost $20 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 1 drink. That's pretty bad considering we can go to Chili's and spend the exact same amount. If I had to pick between here and In-N-Out, which I also love, I'd probably go to Five Guys even though I don't recommend it often because you'll probably have a heart attack :)

This was my first time at this restaurant. I am Italian and I always prefer my dad's cooking to any restaurant, but I love to try new places! Our server was great, prompt and very cheerful! I got a very basic spaghetti with marinara and I had no problems with it. I like that they include bread, soup or salad, and ice cream with the meal that you purchase. You even get to keep the glass when you buy a cream soda. Overall a great time and I liked the decor. I do wish the menu had some more options, though!

I admit that I have missed out on the gem that is Savers. They opened this location in Scottsdale not many years ago near where I used to work and my mom would tell me how great it is, but I never realized just how cool it is! My boyfriend and I have spent the last few months coming here sometimes daily. The beauty in these stores (like Goodwill) is that they're constantly adding new things to the shelves throughout the day, so if you weren't the early bird and missed something in the morning, you can still find good stuff in the afternoon. There's a Quiznos within walking distance so you can eat beforehand, then burn some calories coming here after and walking around the store for an hour!  Some of the staff are very friendly! They have a good amount of high end brands, if you're into that. I've seen LV and Coach purses, very low priced (there ARE ripoff brand purses, but if you know what to look for you can find the real deal). Same goes for jeans...lots of otherwise expensive jeans and shoes that are high-end brands for less than $20. I often times get stuff that is still sealed. I love how they have daily 50% off color-specific tags and Friday's are club card 25% off days. If you have furniture you want to buy, you can pay for it and have them hold it if you need to arrange for transportation to pick it up. and they will help you load in.  The only things that bum me out:  earlier in the summer, they had a punch-card promo. my BF and I were coming here daily and buying stuff, but no one told us about the card. By the time I found out about it (on here, actually!) and I brought it up to the cashier a few weeks ago, he said the promo had already ended. I'm not sure why no one told us the dozens of times we were in there, but now we know for next summer.  Some things are not fully functional. I wish they could be tested and noted on the product (sometimes they are), but we tend to look at the electronics mostly and an iHome I purchased for $6 was only partially functional (electronics are final sale). Radio works, but the actual dock is broken. I even tried switching it out with another dock of the same kind of iHome, but it didn't work. So now I'm stuck with it.   As some others have stated, yes, some of the prices can be marked up. You just have to know what is worth it, and what isn't. Use your judgement -- I can usually quickly tell if something is overpriced or not. Items that are obviously used and have dirt/stains on them should be marked much lower. Last week I got four nice tank tops for $11 after discounts. Now that's a good deal!  I've found a lot of other good deals at this Savers. So far out of all the other Savers I have been to, this is the only one I've bought anything from. I would come to Savers over Goodwill any day (and I DO like Goodwill). They have something for everyone!

I LOVE this little shop tucked away in Fashion Square. Too often people that I know think that Sprinkles is the best cupcake place that the valley has to offer. Sprinkles is honestly at the bottom of the chain for me. Too pricey for a tiny cupcake with zero flavor. What I love about Caketini is that the cupcakes are much larger in size for a smaller cost, and they taste deeelicious. My favorites are the salted caramel and strawberry. They have a huge selection that you will have no problem finding one you  like and will want to end up buying more than one because you cannot decide! Always generous with the frosting and sometimes you get a surprise in the middle. They also do cakes for events and have cakepops. Haven't tried those...YET!  Last time I went there were 1-2 fruit flies which was pretty gross, but I'll be nice and hope next time they take better care of the problem which I had never seen before. Overall, I recommend it!

This "outlet" mall was not worth the drive from Scottsdale to Glendale. What a letdown!  First stop that I was most excited for was H&M. Come to find out, it's not an outlet store in the least. Same exact items and prices as the location inside Fashion Square. No other stores wooed me. No good restaurants in the actual outlet area, but some decent stuff close by the stadium. I won't ever be visiting that area again. Very crowded, too. Oh well!

I could write a huge review about how much I love Portillo's, but I'm going to write a short review, which doesn't mean I love it any less, just that it's simple...I love this place!  I admit I'm addicted to their burgers and fries. I could easily come here all the time and be content with my life. I don't even think about other fast food joints anymore. Love it!! I have yet to try their desserts and shakes, but they look tasty! The food is so fresh. Burgers are delicious. Crinkle fries are crispy with the right amount of salt, topped off with a coke and I'm in burger heaven! Lucky I don't live too far from this location!

Fired Pie is the Chipotle of the pizza world. I love the concept of this place because I'm picky and I modify my order 99% of the time I dine out. They offer fresh, fast pizza and salads. The BF and I ordered pizzas, of course. You start out with customizing everything from the sauce to the toppings -- a variety of meats, cheeses, veggies, herbs. They also offer alcohol as well as serve yourself fountain drinks (woohoo!) You can even grab your own to-go boxes which is very convenient. Not having someone wait on you is great for those who are lunching and need to get back to work promptly. The staff took our empty pizza trays when we were done.   Mine needed more sauce (I don't eat cheese, so more sauce is needed) and it was a bit burnt, but it was still good pizza. The BF enjoyed it a lot and we will definitely go back. and most of all it's reasonably priced. There are a lot of pizza places that will charge you for the pizza and then per individual topping, which can get pricey. This is all the toppings you could want for $7.75.   I read someone's review on here that says they've never burnt her pizza, so maybe it was a one time thing. Next time I'll ask for more sauce :)

I want to give this location three stars, but I'm trying to be nice in hopes they improve upon being the Barros I know and love. I've loved Barros since they put a location in at the Pavilions in Scottsdale. That location has always been amazing and very well priced. Now that they put one in my neck of the woods, I was very excited to try this new location and also introduce my boyfriend to Barros. I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  The only thing we ordered was a 12" pizza. yup, a small one for us to split. Pizza's don't take that long to cook to begin with.  Finally after 30 minutes of waiting (yes, I timed it), I go up to talk to someone and the girl sweeping helps me out. mind you, it's not busy at all. There's maybe five tables occupied if you count ours, too. She goes to check on it and brings out the pizza. Tells us that they're sorry, they messed up on the first pizza (which could be avoided by following orders) so they had to make another one. Good customer service would mean coming to tell us 15 minutes prior that they made a mistake and it's going to be a little bit for them to remake a pizza. We would have been totally fine if someone would have said something. Here we are thinking they just forgot about us.   The pizza itself was completely unlike the one at the other Scottsdale location. When I think of Barros, I think of crust and how they have the best crust. Very bummed that it wasn't it's usual fluffy cust, but flat and barely anything there. Funny thing, as we finished our pizza, the people that had been sitting next to us for quite a while had an employee ask them if they got their pizza yet and they said, "no".  The pros of this visit are that they have oregano you can use yourself, self-serve fountain drinks and  They did let us keep the pizza they messed up on. At least my boyfriend said he enjoyed it!
