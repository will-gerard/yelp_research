I was recommended by a coworker and this place is great! Won't be going anywhere else! Not only do they do a great job on designs they don't make you feel uncomfortable for asking.

Terrible sportsmanship towards visitors!! They will say anything to make you leave and they don't hesitate to get the sheriff and get you kicked out for no reason!! Unbelievable!!

First time here and I'm already a big fan! Amanda kept my brows the thickness they need to be and not so thin you can't tell u have a brow! Needless to say.. I will definitely be back.
