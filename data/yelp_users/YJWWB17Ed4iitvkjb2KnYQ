I am very happy with the chiropractic care I have been receiving at Platinum wellness. I can see actual changes in my posture and they way I walk. The front office staff are friendly and easy to work with. I am most impressed with their billing department. I usually have to hassle my insurance company to get anything  natural covered. The billing has been stress free and I haven't had to call the insurance company once.  I don't give 5 stars lightly but Dr. Infantino and the Staff at Platinum wellness have certainly earned it.

The portions are small and the service is non existent. If you do end up eating here it might be wise to sit at the sushi bar. It took forever to flag a waitress down when we needed something. At least if you sit at the bar you aren't at the mercy of the waitress. At the end of the meal my husband asked if soup came with the meal (he was still hungry). The waitress said "it's complementary, you have to ask for it". We won't be going back to this place...ever.
