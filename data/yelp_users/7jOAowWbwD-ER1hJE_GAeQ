My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.

Growing up in Arizona I remember the days when this place had a lot going for it. Recently, I ventured back on a visit back home and was less then impressed. It would seem that whoever is managing this place now cares more about what the place looks like then whether or not there is actually anything worthy of shopping or eating at. The slide has been so bad here that I fear it will become a ghost town if the economy gets any worse. Before long it won't be worth the rent for the few retailers that are left occupying it. Shame...

If you haven't travelled much, you'll definitely be impressed by this airport. Your experience will likely be heavily dependant on whether you are coming in or flying out. If you are coming in, the whole pick up situation can be pretty frustrating because there is no waiting area for your ride, so they will have to either park or continue to circle the airport until you are out. Baggage seems to take an incredibly long time here, and I don't quite understand why because they only have one claim. It's all going to the same place... anyways, if you are flying out you probably will think it's a great airport.

Well I've been at this Greek food thing for a little while now and I can say with certainty that this is one of the better places I've eaten. I have not been to any other Pita Jungle location, because this was my first time eating there... but I've had many a chicken schwarma. I was a little put off by the lack of description on the menu of what their items actually had in them. For someone that had no experience with Greek food, my mom was overwhelmed trying to figure out what to eat on the menu. I was kind of annoyed also that they didn't call their food what it is traditionally called really at any other Greek place I've been to. Some of the names were the same, but saying Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita... one would think, WTF is that?  This place was REALLY loud when we went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I don't even want to know what this place is like Friday or Saturday night. Fortunately, there was no wait while I was in but that didn't stop us from being here for longer than I would have liked to. Our waiter wasn't all that attentive. Probably the best part of dining at this location is being able to sit out on the patio by the water and see the ducks floating by. However, the tables and chairs on the patio are rather uncomfortable and you'd think for a place that is doing so well they'd be able to put out a better patio scene. Anyways, I would probably go back if I lived in the area. I've paid less for better.

I spent a lot of time here as a kid. Concerts in the summer are a nice thing to visit for. Would recommend for anyone, young or old; a nice cheap family day.

The concept was nice but this place really didn't live up to expectations. There are some standard type store in it, but it doesn't seem to be a functional type mall as much as a tourist destination. The Rainforest Cafe was the highlight for me, which isn't really saying much. I didn't really find a whole lot of places I actually wanted to go into here.

So there probably isn't anything on the menu that's less than 500 calories, and they don't publish their nutrition facts officially but trust me you don't want to know. This place has decent country style food for an average price. The menu variety isn't the greatest but the service is good and everything is nice and greasy... er... tasty.

Been twice now, both times it was consistant in service and food. The menu isn't huge, but they are always open so you can't expect it to be. Good cheap greasy diner food. The area is kinda scary, and the place could probably use some new decor, but considering the traffic that I am sure it has gotten in the many years it's been open I'm willing to overlook it.

Thematically this place really hits the mark but service wise, I don't think you can even expect the bartenders to remember who ordered what drink. The music was offensively awful and the first room you enter is claustrophobically small. As for the prices I'm sure that the volcano cost more than it should of and despite having little tolerance I didn't get much out of it buzz wise. In fact ordering it was a pretty big pain in the ass. We did not really feel comfortable in the area that this bar is located after the sunset.

HOW CAN YOU NOT GIVE THIS PLACE 5 STARS?  I have been to many many antique shops in a lot of different places and honestly, the sheer size of this place alone should earn it at least 4 stars for the selection. I have a feeling that the people that came here and rated this place low didn't find what they were looking for or something, because I can't for the life of me understand why you would give less than 3.   This place is probably best seen in small doses, because it is so large that the entire experience is rather overwhelming. I didn't have the time though to come back another day since I was only visiting. I went through this entire place and it took me several hours to do so, and I was really impressed by the amount of vendors that had what I was looking for. The prices on some things were really great too. I loved that the staff came by and grabbed things from me to put up front so that I didn't have to carry everything around all day.

Nice to look at, does anyone actually buy anything here? The only time I ever went was to eat at the Italian restaurant. They don't have hardly anything in the way of stores... this place is the perfect example of what happens when someone with loads of money fails to manage their property properly.

The first time I went I was very satisfied. The second time I went it seemed that the prices had been raised and it just wasn't as good as I remembered it being. The atmosphere is cool, but the menu is kind of pricey considering the service and the food. The best part about it all is the wine carafe that is 'free with dinner' so I don't know if you can really call it free or not. The old guy with the accordion is a really great scam, he pretends he's going to play a whole song for you but never actually finishes one and the proceeds to linger for his tip. The second time I used the 'no eye contact' strategy so that he wouldn't come bothering my table for money. Everyone pretended to be busy or on the phone!

There's a pool for private parties, a retractable roof (Heat & AC), fireworks, bars and restaurants. Places for this kids to play, a decent amount of souvenir shops and vendors roaming around. The seating was well planned, and the ticket prices aren't ridiculous; what more can you ask for?!

I've been a few times now, stayed in the hotel and visited the shops; went on the rides. The hotel rooms are cheap, but the place is so far from everything else to do on the strip I think they have to be cheap to attract any customers at all. The concept of the rides on the top of the tower is cool, but if you go up on a windy or cold day it really is not very fun. The tickets to ride things are pretty overpriced like everything else in Las Vegas. I didn't brave the food at any of the restaurants while I was there. The shops don't have traditional stores, I'd say they are best for finding cheapo souvenirs to take home but that's about it. I don't think this place has put money into marketing or decor since they opened in the 90s. Walking around this hotel gives me horrible late 80s early 90s flash backs. Everything was clean though, I'll give the place that. You'll not only pay a pretty penny for the view but you'll spend a good portion of your day in line. IMHO it isn't worth the trouble...

Whoever had the idea to display the glass artwork in the gardens here was a genius. If you are in Pittsburgh and only have time for one attraction this is a must. Their Orchid garden is AMAZING. I agree that the labeling of species could be better, but even if you find plants completely boring you will likely be impressed by the displays. In a place where the sky isn't always blue, this certainly is a bright spot.

I used to go all the time when I was in HS and last trip I noticed some change over of the stores from what I remember. The food court has okay variety, but not a whole lot. I think that the management company neglected this place for too long, it definitely needs its facelift. It's great for its convenience if you need to pick something up real quick but I wouldn't be spending all day there.

I've had In-N-Out in Vegas and LA and this location does not disappoint. This place is guaranteed to actually get your order right unlike most fast food places in the area... and imagine, YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PERSON WHO WORKS THE DRIVE THROUGH IS SAYING because English is their first language!

This place must be used to the crowds, because it really seems like their staff has their service down to a science. Both times I've been in it's been very busy and the place is always clean and the food is always the same. As much as I like In & Out, I've had burgers I enjoy a bit more elsewhere. Something has to be said for the noticeably fresh ingredients. I love that this place is right off the freeway; it's a very convenient stop off. The In & Out company store is right across the parking lot for those looking to load up on In & Out merchandise.

I have been to many a sub shop in many a place and consider myself pretty well versed when it comes to meat, cheese, and bread. This place is a joke. My parents hyped it up saying it was so great and my experience was horrible. Even if I actually lived in the area and it was convenient to go back I would not. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. (Yeah yeah I know... I ordered a wrap at a sub shop... give me a break!) First of all, the description says, 'sliced chicken' so I think, okay great, cool, they have deli style chicken not just a chopped up chicken breast! WRONG. My wrap came with chopped chicken... while I watched them make what was soon to be a very disappointing meal I noticed that they put three slices of cheese on the meat while it was on the grill. Where the cheese went when they transferred it from the grill to my wrap I don't know because I was only able to find one gob of it inside the tortilla once I got my hands on it. Along with the MIA cheese, so too followed the buffalo sauce. How you make a buffalo chicken wrap without buffalo sauce is beyond me, I'm still scratching my head. What was the cherry on the sundae for me was the fact that I didn't realize this before we got all the way back to the house, at which point lost the will to do anything about this pathetic thing that I was charged $7 for. Our total came to around $15 with tax of course, but that was for my wrap and my boyfriend's sandwich. No drink. No chips. No sides. RIDICULOUS. Take my advice and go to Charley's, wouldn't get too attached to a place I don't think will be in business very long. The workers are too busy chatting to get your order right.

If you think that this food is great, you need to seriously re-evaluate your burger standards. I was dragged here by my grandmother because she loves this place and my mother, brother and I left with nothing but regret.   The burgers here are awful, my chicken sandwich was nothing special, and the fries are G-ross with a capital G. My mom told my brother and I after the fact that the last time that she visited this place she was running to the toilet immediately afterwards, and my brother had the same results after our dining experience.   My mom got an earful about not saving us from this place. Seriously, save your money, drive to In-N-Out or something, sure this place has menu variety but that's about the only thing it's got going for it. I feel bad for anyone that is deluded enough to give this place 5 stars because you obviously have no idea what a good burger is.

This is the best Applebee's I've been to in a long time. The service was good and the food was made properly. I usually order the same things so I can tell when the cooks are slacking; they certainly didn't at this place!
