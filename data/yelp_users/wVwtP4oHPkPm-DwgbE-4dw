First Yelp review I've ever left. Because service here was AWFUL. Before here, I had went to Verizon. They told me to come to an Apple store. The Apple store told me in 10 minutes I'd have an appointment with their "Geniuses", and I had to wait for like 30 minutes. Then, when I saw the stupid "Genius" (who was a DUMBASS), he just told me that I'd need to pay to replace my phone, and that it could not be fixed. The GENIUS claimed my phone had water damage and was very rude to me when I insisted it did not - he said he'd "repeat the question" again about the water damage, which I still insisted I had no knowledge of it having. I went back to Verizon and they simply plugged it in, and restarted it, and the phone turned on and was working fine. Verizon said the phone didn't appear to have any problems and was confused about why the Apple Genius would have told me such things. I almost paid $200 to get another phone! In addition, the Apple GENIUS claimed my phone wasn't even registered to me, it was registered to someone in Texas! I've had this phone a year! At Verizon they checked it, via my ACCOUNT, and said the serial number is registered to me! TERRIBLE experience.
