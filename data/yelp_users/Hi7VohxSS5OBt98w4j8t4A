Mouthwatering food.  I have been here a few times, as it is walking distance from my office.   The first time I ordered the vegetarian panang curry. Delicious and spicy. My only issue is I was sweating profusely on the walk back to the office.   The last couple times I ordered the veggie pad thai. So scrumptious! They plate it beautifully. They use a good variety of fresh veggies... not just the standard broccoli and carrots. Lots of zucchini and cauliflower. Yum. The sauce has a lot of fresh garlic. It is so delectable. May be the best pad thai I have had in Phoenix.  Service is prompt and friendly. For lunch I am in and out under 40 minutes. They keep the fresh iced tea flowing...  I can't help but growl when co-workers ask me where I ate for lunch. "Wild Thaiger... rowl!"

This was the hotel my wedding party and I stayed in the weekend of my wedding. We figured it was the best choice since it was right next door to the reception venue and it was very inexpensive. The highs and lows of the hotel equal out to a solid 3.5.  I booked one of the "penthouse" suites. It had 2 queen beds and one sofa bed in the sitting room. For the night before the wedding I thought this would be perfect for my mom, sister, and niece. Except the sofa bed didn't work and was actually a safety hazard. We almost got killed trying to pull it off. We called the front desk trying to get a roll a way for my poor Mama but they said the roll a ways were locked up because house keepers left and they are the only ones that have the keys. ??? My mom ended up sleeping on the couch.   No major problems other than the broken sofa bed. It is not super nice looking, and the decor in boring and outdated. However, it is a good size and very convenient. The bathroom was oddly large and included a huge tub. The balcony was spacious. Our room looked over north Phoenix and was directly above the Irish Cultural Center, which was our reception site. It was great to be able to watch the set up from our balcony.   The staff was very nice. They were also apologetic about some of the conditions of the property. My sisters asked some of the staff to decorate our suite for our wedding night, and after the reception we were surprised by candles everywhere in our room and a bottle of champagne! Very sweet.   Overall I am pleased with our stay at the hotel. It is old, outdated, and definitely not fancy, but when it comes to value, convenience, and location it can't be beat.

What a nicy, cozy way to end a date! My husband and I have rounded out a few date nights here. We have only gone for reverse happy hour, not for dinner. The prices for reverse happy hour are very reasonable.  The mojitos are fantastic, as well as the wine. We have had their cheese plate (fantastic selection of cheeses!), their pizzas, and mac and cheese. Very good. My husband had their goat cheese and chicken phyllo pockets and enjoyed them.   We have always sat at the bar and have gotten very good service from the bartenders.   Highly recommended, especially as a quiet way to wind down a rowdy First Friday night!

I stopped in here during a lunch break at a nearby work conference. It was 10am and I was jonesing for a breakfast burrito. The atmosphere is nothing fancy but it was clean. The lady at the counter was very nice. I ordered a breakfast burrito without meat. It took a little longer than I thought it would, but they make everything super fresh. The potatoes in the burrito tasted freshly cut. The burrito itself was scrumptious and hit the spot, even though it was just a little greasy. If I lived closer I would definitely return for a hangover burrito. ;)

One of the best places for breakfast. We used to live within walking distance and we would have breakfast here frequently. Scott's rivals Chompies with large hearty breakfasts with quicker and better service.  We usually stick to omelets. They are giant, overstuffed, kinda greasy but good. The home fries are some of the best in the city. And all the egg dishes include the option of a bagel with cream cheese. Their bagels are awesome.   After filling your belly with goodness, stop by Karsh's next door to take some pastries home for later.

I miss this place!  We used to live around the corner from Flavors of India and went here at least a couple times a month.  Favorite dishes were Malai Kofta (sp?) and Palak Paneer. My husband loved their lamb dishes.  Their lunch buffet was just okay. Could have a better selection.  Service was always good. They are sooo nice. One time we ordered takeout and my husband who was sick at the time picked it up. The girl at the counter offered him a little baggie of spices to help with his ailment. How sweet and thoughtful!   When we eat in for dinner, we enjoy the Indian beer, and my husband REALLY enjoys the Bollywood music videos. Hmmm... could it be the completely gorgeous Indian women dancing around in saris?

Great happy hour.  This place makes me miss my old neighborhood. My husband and I used to go during happy hour and order tons of food and drinks and get out of there under $30. Our rotation of munchies includes potato skins (sans bacon), hummus, wings, fried mozzarella, and ALWAYS fried pickles. Their fried pickles are soooo good. If you like pickles and fried food, you will LOVE their fried pickles.  Large drafts and wells are reasonably priced. Their bloody marys are probably my favorite in the valley. Ask for a cajun rim!  Service is usually good.

I was browsing Yelp and saw all the bad reviews of Aunt Chiladas. I laughed because of all my bad experiences there myself.   Every time I have gone there for food I have had a horrible experience. They have very limited choices for vegetarians. Now, I understand Mexican food is not vegetarian friendly. I am half Mexican myself. I know refried beans and tamales are traditionally made with lard and sauces and rice often have stock in them. I am usually able to ignore it if I can't taste it. Or a server will be able to offer me vegetarian options.   Every time I have gone there and ordered the vegetable burrito or cheese enchilada combo, the beans tasted horrible. The last time I ordered food there, I was with a very big group of family and friends. I ordered the bean and cheese nachos. The beans tasted and horrible and I asked the server what was in the beans. He said there was bacon in it. I told him I was a vegetarian and ordered the cheese quesadilla. He informed me that there was lard in the tortilla. I told him I would stick to the chips and salsa. He told me there was lard in the chips. I asked him if there was anything without lard and he yelled at me (in front of the whole restaurant) that everything had lard in it. I sarcastically asked him if my margarita had lard in it. He smiled and said no.   To be fair, I have gone there just for drinks in the bar a few times and had a good time. The bartenders were always nice and they had good bands playing.   So imagine my horror when I found out my high school reunion was going to be at Aunt Chiladas. My $40 ticket included a buffet full of lard. At least 2 drink tickets were included. But I wasn't going to let a bad restaurant ruin my night of reuniting with my high school chums. So I had a good meal beforehand and hung out around the bar all night. The bar staff was great and I had a wonderful time. :)

Hmmmm... got a message from a manager/owner of Aunt Chiladas regarding my review. Still not sure how I feel about it.  She informed me of the new vegan/vegetarian options on their menu and told me which items contained animal products. Helpful. I guess...   But then she said their refried beans are made with bacon which is "traditional in Mexican cooking." Maybe traditional in YOUR family. Keep in mind my mother is Mexican. She said growing up her mother would refry beans in lard. But bacon? Nope. Bacon was a luxury. And after several members of the family became vegetarian my grandmother and other family members still made some pretty damn good beans and tortillas, lard-free.   She then went on to say that the menu chosen by my high school reunion committee was not a menu I would have chosen for myself if I would have known the other options. Sigh. I have been a vegetarian my whole life. When I see a Mexican buffet, I can usually count on chips, salsa, beans, and rice. But the waiter who yelled at me said EVERYTHING had a meat product in it. And this was way before their "new" menu came out with vegetarian options, including vegetarian black beans.   Her apology was half-a**ed. She apologized for my "experience".  She didn't even apologize for the unbelievably rude and mean behavior of the server who yelled at me for asking about vegetarian items.  And one more thing I forgot to throw in my previous review. At my reunion, the bartender they had in the banquet room was awful. A rude, angry bitter old man. Just warning anyone who might have an event here. Luckily the party moved to the main bar and the staff there is awesome. See? I give credit where it is due...

Yep. Still sucks.  Went their recently for a friend's birthday. Didn't want to but it was for one of my oldest friends and I didn't want to disappoint her.   I only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa. Drinks were good but the chips and salsa weren't great. The server seemed annoyed I wasn't ordering food, but do you blame me with my past experiences? I had a taste of my friend's cheese enchilada and vegan black beans the staff is so proud of. Not impressed.  Yelpers please keep in mind that some of the 5 star reviews you see posted for Aunt Chiladas quite possibly may be an employee. How do I know this? Because I got a message from an employee after my last update. She said that she knows which bartender I am talking about that was rude at my HS reunion and said "he is really great, just not for banquets." She also said "I do not know why any server would yell at you, that is just ridiculous." And my personal favorite "And yes, there is bacon and lard in our re fried beans. I have no hispanic background, so I am not sure what is traditional. But they are pretty tastey." But then she says " With that said, I really hope you come back."  Direct quotes. And this employee has a glowing 5 star review for Aunt Chiladas and she says nothing about being an employee. Isn't this breaking some sort of Yelp rule? And what business does she have messaging me unless she is a manager?   Sorry but I wouldn't trust any Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area that has less than 4 stars. There are many better choices.

I have been going to Ray's Pizza for almost 20 years. It is a solid dependable place for yummy, thin crust New York style pizza. I am especially fond of their mushroom pizza. Yes, the mushrooms are canned and I usually detest canned food but they season them beautifully. Very reasonable prices too.

I made the mistake of going here once for lunch. Blah. The food wasn't good and the service was bad. They seemed to hate me for some reason.

I basing this rating only on the two types of spinach pizza they have because that is all we have ordered from them. Those pizzas are delicious and absolutely addictive. I usually don't like sweet pizza sauces but their sauce is awesome. I usually don't like spending that much money on pizza (a large spinach is $20) but it is so damn good that they have me wrapped around their finger.   Service is good too. We have only ordered take out but they have always been friendly and accurate with their time. We have shown up early before and ordered a beer at the bar while we wait for our pizza. It seems that they have good beer specials most of the time.   Delicious pizza and worth every penny!

Spinato's has lost my business forever. Yes the pizza is excellent, however something must be done about phone orders. I was bragging to my mother in law, who was visiting from out of town, how incredible their pizza is. I planned on picking up a couple pizzas on the way home from work. I call first at 6:45. An answering system says I'm 3rd in line. After 5 minutes it kicks me off and sends me to voice-mail. I tried again about 8 times within the next hour. Same thing. Except one of the times it said I was 2nd in line but I still got booted off after 5 minutes. Ridiculous! I totally understand that places get crazy busy. But they should have someone actually answer the frickin phone! Hire more people if they have to. I gave up around 7:45. I ordered from Isa's instead. Great pizza and they have the decency to answer their customers phone calls despite how busy they get.

Manuel's has always been a safe, solid choice for Mexican food. It has always done the job. I haven't been in for a couple years so when I went last night, I was pleased that not much has changed.  We started out with the Texas margaritas. They are HUGE. Delicious and worth every cent. But POTENT. I have a high alcohol tolerance, especially when it comes to tequila, but my husband couldn't even finish his because he has a low tolerance for tequila and he was the DD. So I finished his. :)  Salsa and chips were good. Salsa was very fresh tasting. I wish the chips were hotter and crispier. They tasted like the generic chips you buy at the store.  My husband ordered the 3 amigos enchilada plate. He said it was really good. I tasted the spinach enchilada that came with the plate, and I concur that it was really tasty.  I had the chili relleno plate which I'm still scratching my head over. I must have had over a million chili rellenos in my life but never one like this. The chili wasn't dipped in a batter, it was just wrapped in egg. I was disappointed by this dish. I know the that the batter for chili rellenos contains mostly egg, but it's not pure egg. It has a little flour, milk, and sometimes baking powder to make it fluffy. The sauce that covered it wasn't very saucy. It was green chilis and onion basically. The whole thing wasn't terrible, just disappointing. Beans and rice were still delish though.  I am still rounding up to 4 stars because everything else I have had at Manuels has been great. Cheese enchiladas, their gigantic cheese crisps... all delicious and satisfying. And their service is always excellent. I will just avoid the chili relleno from now on.

My regular nail place was closed for a month for vacations so I was looking for a place for my pedicure fix. Capri Nails had decent reviews and cheap prices so I gave them a try.  They did a good job. They were very clean. Foot massage was heavenly. My toenails looked great and the paint job lasted for a couple weeks.   I highly recommend them and they will be my back-up nail place. :)

THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN!   Mi Pueblo has been my favorite Mexican food for years! Forget the chains and the greasy taco places. Mi Pueblo is authentic and fresh tasting. They don't use lard yet their food still tastes so traditional.  It is NOT fancy inside. You order at the counter and help yourself to their delicious hot chips and their zippy fresh salsa. The family that owns the place is so nice. They never mess up an order even complicated ones.   The food is incredible. My husbands favorites include the fish tacos, twin chimis, and the green chili pork. I love the chili relleno, the enchiladas, and the bean tostada. Try them for breakfast too! Huge plates of egg dishes, potatoes, beans and tortillas. Perfect hangover remedy! And I think they serve menudo too!  Everything is reasonably priced. You spend half as much as if you would going to Valle Luna or Macayos and the food is 10x better. We have ordered their party trays before for football parties and for our wedding rehearsal dinner. For under 40 bucks you can get a gigantic tray full of mini tacos, chimis, and quesadillas. They are supposed to feed 8-10 but they are big enough to feed more than that! Mmmmm...

I love Uncle Sams. I grew up in this area and have fond memories of ditching high school to nosh on pizza slices and cheese hoagies.  Now as an adult, I still love their pizza and now love their amazing beer specials. As the financially responsible parent in the family, I love that we can share a large pizza, a couple of small portioned appetizers, a pitcher of beer for the grown ups, and a soda for the kid for under $30. All while watching a game on one of the many TVs.

I have been to Michelinas a couple times in the last 6 years or so. Both times the food was very good.  Last time I had the eggplant Parmesan. Very tasty and a generous portion. My husband had their seafood pasta which he said was delicious.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the steep prices. It's not very often I spend more than $20 on a vegetarian dish. Hence why I only went a couple times. But the service is great and the atmosphere is classy and romantic. It is a good place for a special occasion.

I went to Bella Nails on a suggestion from a friend who told me how good their prices are. $10 for a mani, $16 for a pedi, and $25 for a mani/ pedi. I wasn't expecting much for the price.  The atmosphere isn't great, the location is iffy, but other than that it was amazing! Very nice staff. My nail tech must have spent about 10 minutes massaging my legs and feet. 1 hour later I still feel like melted butter. I spent half as much as I normally spend for a pedicure but my nail tech gave one of the best pedis I have ever had.   I'm hooked. The wait was pretty long so I'm going to start making twice monthly appointments. Highly recommended.

I found Faust a year ago when I was looking for a vet close to my house. I had a really good vet that I went to but it was an hour drive away. I had a friend that took her dog to Faust and said they were great. So, I reluctantly gave them a try...   And I am so glad I did! Both vets there are fantastic. Sympathetic, knowledgeable, and willing to provide lots of options for treatment. They have spent alot of time with me on the phone, answering many questions. They even call me monthly to see how my sickly cat is doing. And they are very patient. My cat is a PILL in the vet's office. He doesn't like anything being done to him. It took 3 of them to hold him down to take blood. But they are sweet and patient and have found ways to work with him.   Tammy and the other office staff are wonderful. After my cat threw himself and his carrier off the chair in the waiting room, the peed all over the floor, Tammy rushed to help me clean it up and minimized my embarrassment and concern.   Ozzy and I love Faust!

I have been going to Saba's for over 10 years now and always had a good experience. Up until today I would rate it 4 stars. Yummy falafel, delicious vegetarian red lentil soup were among my favorites. Their house dressing is lemony goodness.   But today's visit pushed them to a 5 star for me.  While running errands, I stopped in for a quick bite. I intended to keep it light and healthy. Which is very easy to do here. Salads, vegetarian pitas, soups are all healthy choices they have that are also very delicious.   They have added some exciting additions to their menu since I have last been in.  I see the rolled hummus sandwich which I have had before and enjoyed. Pita, hummus (which now you can choose from different kinds- I chose pesto hummus), lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and a pickle. Yum. And I knew I wasn't completely blowing my diet.  Then I see Greek fries and my heart stops. Feta, herbs and spices, and lemon wedges on fries?? Would I like to add them on to my wrap? Um, yes please.  I was kicking myself for doubling my calorie intake while I was waiting for my food.   The food comes out fast and all my guilt and self-loathing are replaced by pure desire for the food I'm about to consume. The portions were ginormous. Big enough for 2. I make a deal with myself to only eat half the fries. The fries covered with the most feta and spices of course. The pita was crunchy, hummus-y yummyness. The fries were so damn tasty.   The prices, especially the sandwiches and salads, are very reasonably priced. I checked out the drink menu and noticed bottled beers were between $3 and $3.50. Not bad at all. They had a couple unique beers by the bottle and by tap.   Service was warm, friendly, and prompt.   Afterwards, I thought "Why I have been away for so long?" But I will be back Sabas. Oh yes, I will be back.

So pleasantly surprised about this place! I have lived nearby for years and heard about it from friends but never been in. I really missed out!  So far we have only been in for happy hour, which has some amazing deals. Wells and beers are dirt cheap. So are appetizers. I ordered the tortilla flat which is gigantic and only a few bucks during HH. It is loaded with green chilis which give it a lot of flavor and zip. The salsa that accompanies it is home made and very fresh and tasty. The guacamole is kind of gross. It's that fake, strangely colored guac. Just skip it. My husband loves their wings and onion rings.   Service is prompt and friendly. The background music is a little too loud... I know its a bar and all but I can barely have a conversation. I understand it is a prime spot for karaoke. Unfortunately, I hate karaoke so I will be sure to leave before it starts up. :)

I'm so happy that Roma Garden is getting so many fantastic reviews! I have been going there for years, even when it used to be located on Bell Rd.  The service is always warm and friendly. The owner is a very sweet Italian man who makes sure everyone is enjoying the food and experience.   It is perfect for a romantic dinner. Nice decor and lighting. And the complimentary amaretto shot at the end of dinner is a nice touch.  My husband has ordered a variety of dishes and loved them all. Especially their specials.   I always order their eggplant parm. It is the BEST I have ever had. It comes with a side of pasta and I order it with pesto sauce. AMAZING pesto. Creamy and delicious.  I work close by and occasionally order take out for lunch. Under $9 and comes with bread. The portion is so huge I have lunch for the next day too!  I haven't had dessert there yet but my friend says they make delicious desserts. I have always been to full to try them!  Knowing that Roma Garden exists makes it a crime to go to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. For just a little more money, you can have a freshly cooked AUTHENTIC Italian meal instead of that pre-prepared crap that OG and MG serves...

I was pleasantly surprised by this location. I wouldn't call Rubio's "authentic" by any means but if you are looking for a quick fix for your taco cravings it will do the trick.  The food is pretty good. I adore their poblano and mushroom tacos. Not many places serve veggie tacos so this makes me happy. These tacos are stuffed with grilled poblanos, portabellas, fresh avocado, cilantro, and queso fresco. Plus the taco shell has cheese crisped on to it. It is a surprising and tasty twist.   I have always liked their beans and before I discovered their tacos I would get a plain old bean burrito.  My husband always gets fish tacos or burritos and always says they are good.  Their salsa isn't the best but they have a few different kind of varieties.  Portion sizes are kinda flimsy especially their side items...  Service at this location is awesome! The lady running the register is sooooo nice and seems extremely competent.    They also sell beer which is nice for a fast food establishment. I haven't imbibed yet because I always order takeout but I saw a sign that said all beer is $2.50 in the evenings. Hmmmm... I might have to come back for that.  Give Rubio's a chance- they might surprise you.

Great little hole in the wall middle eastern deli. I like their grocery store. You can find many unique and hard to find items. There food is great. LOVE their lentil soup. It is so creamy and flavorful. I have never had lentil soup like this anywhere else. I order it often when I'm sick. Great salad and falafel. Service has always been good. The older man that owns the place is very sweet.   I just wish they had expanded hours. Last I checked they closed at 7pm and were closed Sundays.

We are pretty much regulars at Brennans now. It is a reliable place to watch the game with cheap drinks. There is a great view of the TV from almost every spot.  The bartenders are AWESOME. They are quick,  friendly, and really seem to care about providing good service.   The servers are good too. Very sweet and take care of their regulars. There is confusion among them sometimes about who is helping our table but it is usually resolved quickly and they are apologetic.  The food that is good is very good, the food that is bad is pretty bad. Luckily, the number of items on the menu that is good outnumbers the bad. Here is a rundown on the good stuff- the Irish Nachos, Mexican pizza, cheese curds, potato skins, wings, enchiladas. All pretty good. Oh, and salsa too. It's freshly made and very zippy!  I would stay away from the zucchini and mozzarella sticks. Both are too greasy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella stick is ginormous, which seems appealing at first but it is just too much cheese and too little breading.   I wish they had more food specials because the appetizers will set you back 7-10 bucks a plate. But the portions are huge. They do have an amazing mexican night on Tuesday. $1.25 enchiladas and tacos. And we were pleasantly surprised about how tasty the tacos and enchiladas are.   The crowd in Brennans is diverse and interesting. I love a diverse crowd and all but be prepared to listen to either a full hour of country or a full hour of gangsta rap on the jukebox. That can get annoying when the jukebox is completely dominated by a person whose musical tastes are limited to one genre.   Overall, we love Brennans and we can call it our home away from home.

Really, I should know better...  It was late at night, we didn't feel like fast food burger places, and I have driven past this place millions of times.   It's in a dark scary lot too close for comfort to Greenway square. Probably not the best place for a woman to go by herself late at night, but luckily I had the husband with me.  After looking at the extensive menu, I ordered the chili relleno plate and my husband ordered a chicken burrito, beef taco, and a horchata.   I couldn't finish my chili relleno plate. (Quick lesson in Mexican cooking- when preparing anything with chilis, its a good idea to remove the majority of the seeds. Not just because of the heat, but because its NOT fun to have a mouthful of seeds.) Besides the hundreds of chewy seeds in my mouth, the chili rellenos were lukewarm. The whole plate was pretty bland, and with every bite I took I knew my stomach would be paying for it later. So I only ate half, then popped 3 tums and hoped for the best. I ended not having serious food poisoning, but I definitely felt uncomfortable all night.  On the other hand, my husband didn't think his food was too bad. His chicken burrito did  have a couple bones in it. He liked the beef taco.   I might come back for a breakfast burrito. After all, it is hard to screw up an egg and potato burrito. It seems like this food would taste much better while drunk or hungover.

This dark dive has been around for a long time. I have many memories here. After my college graduation, instead of having a big party with lots of people, I chose to go here with my husband and day drink. :)  The bartenders are always very friendly and the drinks are usually very cheap but... I would ask about the price of certain pitchers of beer before purchasing one. Certain brands are shockingly pricey. Other than that great bar to just hang out and have some good times with friends.

I really love Safeways, this one in particular.  Clean, warm, and inviting stores, good selection and quality of food. Their produce is especially good. Unique deli choices.  Their service is phenomenal. Every employee acts like they actually like working there. No one seems like they were just let out on parole, unlike a few other grocery stores... Cashiers are warm and friendly. Even the produce guys ask you how you are doing and will even spontaneously carve up fresh samples of produce for you on the spot. It is like every employee is on happy pills. Kind of remind me of the characters from the move "Pleasantville".  So why only 4 stars instead of 5? The price!! Even their sale items are more expensive than the normally priced items at Fry's, Target, or Wal-Mart. I understand the whole "you get what you pay for" concept and it is great that they attract and keep a good work staff. But I need to stretch my dollar and feed my hungry family on a budget. So, alas, Safeway and I have an on and off relationship.

Have to give a shout out to this place. Although I have only gone to "Cocktails" a few times in the last few years, it will always have a special place in my heart.  Flash back 25 years ago. My Dad used to take me here for happy hour with his work buddies. Some may say that isn't good parenting. Maybe its not. But I have very fond memories of sitting up at the bar getting my cheeks pinched by the bartender and the patrons. The nice, smoky voiced, wrinkly blond female bartender would put a zillion maraschino cherries in my shirley temple. And I would play darts with my Daddy. I feel warm and fuzzy just thinking about it.  Once I would hit adulthood I would stop in every so often. Though my life was constantly changing this bar just felt like home.   Another warm fuzzy memory? My brother proposed to his amazing wife here on New Years Eve a few years ago. I wasn't there at the time, but he text me pictures after the proposal.  Great prices, great service, great memories.

Our favorite Chinese restaurant! Lots of flavor and minimal grease. My husband usually orders beef and broccoli and I always get their veggie egg foo young. Perfect comfort food. Great friendly service too! Slightly pricier than other Chinese restaurants but well worth the quality. And the portions are huge!

I would give Saguaro Family Practice 5 stars if it were based purely on my primary physician.   Dr. Gujrathi has been my doctor for about 8 years and she is absolutely amazing. She is patient, open minded, talented, intuitive, and caring. I used to hate doctors until I started seeing her. She has seen me through the ups and downs of the last 8 years of my medical history. I actually look forward to visits with her (even when I'm feeling like total crap!) just because she is SUCH a pleasure to be around.  I am only knocking off one star because of other staff members. I have had to see other doctors at the practice when she was booked and I did not like their bedside manner and one time I was even misdiagnosed.   Most of the time the office staff is great, but I have had a few experiences where they were rude or impatient. In particular, I went to an after hours appointment recently and thought the only young woman working behind the front counter crossed the line from rude to a little nasty.  Minor annoyances aside, SFP, in particular Dr. G, is fantastic!

I have only had breakfast here a few times, but thought it was great. They have large portioned, country style breakfasts. Very good value since some of the other nearby breakfast places charge much more for smaller portions. Everything tastes fresh (no frozen potatoes!) and the service is friendly. I just wish it was a little bigger inside the restaurant, since its a bit cramped.

Delicioso!  We have been going to Havana Cafe for years. It has been consistently a good experience. Good service and good food.  Dinner itself is always yummy. I always order the ChoCho. Stuffed squash with a mouthwatering curry sauce. Soooo good. My husband has something different every time, usually seafood or pork. He is never disappointed. Last time we went we split a bowl of pumpkin curry soup. OMG! I usually hate pumpkin but this was incredible!  My only complaint is the price for the portion they serve. Don't get me wrong, it is super yummy. But vegetarian entrees run between 15-20 and meat and seafood are usually over 20. They don't include any salad, soup, or bread and the portions are rather small.   What we do more often than dinner is happy hour. Tapas are very inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Black bean fritters, sun chips, Spanish tortilla. Yum. Mojitos and sangria are on special too. Both drinks are really good. Havana Cafe is the ONLY restaurant in Arizona where I like the sangria. The bartender is nice and we usually have the bar to ourselves... what else can you ask for?

This place was really good!  We chose to go here for a romantic date which was a mistake... not that we didn't have a good time but it was not a romantic setting at all. The name sounded romantic to me. But it was the opposite of romantic. Loud, brightly lit, sassy servers, and children running amok. Reminded me instead of a raucous Italian family reunion. But still a good time!  I love that it's BYOB with no corkage fee. That itself is a great value on it's own.   We started with the bruschetta. We weren't planning on getting an appetizer but we were talked into it. Yes, the servers are a bit pushy with the upselling. But the bruschetta was tasty and bursting with fresh flavor so we were glad we did.  I had the eggplant rollettini and my husband had the pork Parmesan. The portions weren't as big as they are in other Italian restaurants. I was expecting leftovers to take home. But still very filling. My eggplant was very tasty but a bit salty. My husband and I both loved the marinara. It was very unique. I detected a warm seasoning to it... cinnamon or nutmeg? I don't know but it was good. My husband thought his pork was delicious. He said it lacked breading but was still excellent.  We will definitely return but we learned our lesson. Expect a casual and energetic good time with delicious food. We see this being a great spot for a double date... each couple bringing a great bottle of wine.

I don't get it. I don't understand how Olive Garden always has a long wait for dinner. Their food tastes like cardboard.  The only reason I went last weekend is because our very kind neighbor gave us a gift card for Christmas that we haven't used. We should have regifted.   Let's start with the breadsticks. Salty and drab. Maybe I just got spoiled with other Italian eateries that give you a loaf of fresh bread and either herb butter or herbed olive oil. These are covered with garlic SALT.   My husband had the salad which was decent, but c'mon. Their dressing is so commercialized now. I had the minestrone soup which was, again, decent. Tastes like it's from a can.  I had the baked ziti which was flavorless. My husband had a chicken garlic pasta dish which is edible but, again, not great.   Service was very good. I feel sorry for the waiter for having to work at Olive Garden. He should take his good food service skills somewhere else.  I must share my experience at the OG from a couple years ago. I ordered the manicotti- which they don't have anymore. While eating I dug out a huge piece of plastic. The server got the manager who explained to me that it was a  plastic bag that the food comes in. She was extremely apathetic about the whole situation and I only got comped for my meal.   People can save alot of money by skipping a trip to the Olive Garden and buying a Stouffers frozen Italian meal. If you do want to spend money on a good Italian meal check out the ma and pop local Italian places. Roma Garden and Aiello's are a good start. They are the same price for real homemade Italian food.

Just okay.  Stopped by for their reverse happy hour.  Salsa was good. Kind of spicy for mild which I liked.  Disappointed that the bean dip AND the queso had chorizo.   We split the Mexican pizza subbing the meat for beans. Greasy but satisfying. It's good if you put tons of salsa on it. About halfway through eating it however, I detected something meaty in their beans. Now, I am not a super strict vegetarian. I will eat refried beans at most Mexican places as long as there is not an overwhelming lard or meaty taste. (On a side note though- I feel it is completely unnecessary to use lard or meat products in beans. My favorite Mexican food place- Mi Pueblo- makes excellent beans with no lard. When beans are a vegetarian staple, why would a restaurant be inconsiderate and make it non-vegetarian? Okay- end rant.) So back to Arriba's beans... It tasted something a bit porkish. It kind of killed my appetite so I was done after two pieces.  My husband also ordered pork taquitos which he was underwhelmed by. Although a big chorizo fan, he said the queso it came with wasn't great.  Our server was good. Charming and accommodating.  But what really turned me off was the bill. My husband didn't tell me until we were in the car, so I didn't have a chance to fight it. $31 total. Hmmmm... happy hour prices on the Mexican pizza should have been $8 and $3. On top of that a draft Bud Light (also on special) and a Corona. $31 does NOT make sense. Our server didn't seem so charming and accommodating anymore.   Yeah, so we won't be back. Way too many good Mexican places to bother with Arriba.

We love Four Peaks!  Good beer. Pitchers are very reasonably priced during HH.  Yummy food with great vegetarian choices. How nice it is to go watch a game, nosh on upgraded vegetarian bar food, and wash it down with local brew...

I crave eggs at lunchtime. Constantly. Luckily the Good Egg is a 5 minute walk from my office.  I usually order the Castroville omelet. Filled with good stuff like artichokes, spinach, and cheese. I like the potatoes it comes with, usually they are hot and perfectly crispy. However last time I was there the potatoes came out lukewarm and slightly undercooked. No bueno.   Service is quick and friendly. I can get in and out of there under 30 minutes. My iced tea is always promptly refilled. (Their iced tea is awesome by the way- order the tea of the day.)  Is the Good Egg the best breakfast I have had in Phoenix? Of course not. It's not fancy or gourmet by any means, but it is satisfying and relieable.

I have gone here off and on for a few years. I am a tomboy who wears her hair in a ponytail 80% of the time, so sometimes I just go to Great Clips or a friend with a steady hand for a trim. But when I splurge on a good haircut and/or color I go to Jorge at Regis. He always does an amazing job even with my difficult texture. When he colored my hair it was soooo luminous and beautiful.  But what I really love is that my mother goes to him. My mother hasn't had her hair professionally done in about 30 years. She is a beautiful woman but never really cared about spending money on herself. After a tough divorce, she decided to get professional cuts and styling advice. Jorge really helped transform her hair and gave her so much confidence! He treated her like she was his own mother.   Thanks Jorge!

I really like Mi Patio. I wish it were closer to my house!  They have a good and unique vegetarian selection. You aren't limited to bean and cheese burritos, chili rellenos, and cheese enchiladas. They have a feta spinach chimichanga I have been dying to try.  Both times I went their I had this enormous combo with a cheese enchilada, chili relleno, and bean tostada. A LOT of food! But really, really good.  My husband had their fish tacos which he loved.  Fresh hot chips and zippy salsa.  Great drink specials too. Really cheap margaritas and beer. Their margaritas aren't the greatest or strongest but you can't complain for the price.

My favorite Mexican restaurant is the Mi Pueblo on Union Hills. My 2nd favorite is this Mi Pueblo located by Metro Center. The only reason it is my 2nd favorite is because it is way out of my neighborhood. But it is delicious.  No, it's not a coincidence that it has the same name and incredibly awesome food just like the north location. They are owned by 2 brothers. Interestingly enough, the food isn't exactly alike, but there are certain flavors and menu items that are similar.   I do like how this location has sit down service AND booze. Contrary to what the yelp description says about alcohol, it does not only have beer and wine. There is a full bar. And the last time I went, their margaritas were on special for only $2! And they were good and very STRONG... My husband was thrilled that he got me drunk for only $4.  They have an expanded seafood menu with all the traditional Mexican seafood cocktails...   Chips and salsa VERY good.  I had the spinach enchiladas which were heavenly. Not too greasy with 2 delicious enchilada sauces. Beans and rice were great too. My husband loved his fish tacos.  Service was perfect. Attentive and friendly.   Highly recommended! Give those big chains a break and try this family run little joint.

After much anticipation my husband and I finally tried Mi Comida last night. I am so glad we did!   We got there about 8:30 and the place was packed with a small group of people waiting for a table outside. (No other place to wait.) We waited for about 15 minutes, while trying not to stare at the what everyone is eating outside.   When we were finally seated we waited another 15 minutes to get our order taken. The only person running the front of the house is a very cute older gentleman with a heavy accent. So service was a bit slow... After he took our order we waited patiently for our beers. For about about another 10 minutes. The man realized he forgot our beers, apologized, and went and grabbed them. But seriously, this man is so damn sweet it is hard to get mad at him. His smile melted any annoyance that was building up inside of us.   Our food finally came. I ordered the green chili and cheese tamale, the plantain and cheese empanada, the vegetable flan, and a side of beans. The tamale and empanada  were excellent. Very flavorful. I didn't like the vegetable flan though. The texture was a bit off, like molded baby food. And I should of asked about the beans, because they had pork in them. (I'm a vegetarian.) My husband happily ate them. He said they were delicious. My husband ordered a ceviche plate and a pork empanada. He said it was great.   We will definitely be back. The menu is huge and we can't wait to try some new dishes!

I have been going to Santisi's for years even though it is a bit out of my way. It is a great place to watch a game, however many people feel the same way so it is often packed, especially during a big game. Finding a table can be difficult. If you are with a group I highly suggest going early and camping out until the game starts.  Drink prices are a little high for a sports bar... but not too obscene. Mixed drinks are nice and strong.   Most of the food is awesome. Pizza is good, so are garlic knots, fried zucchini, and pizza bread. My husband loves their chicken fingers as well. But the BEST item they have are their calzones. OMG!! They are the BEST calzones in the valley. They are great even without any toppings, just cheese. Nice and crispy on the outside, perfectly seasoned, with very fresh tasting ricotta and mozzarella on the inside. Heaven. And they are huge. Can easily feed two people, especially if you share an appetizer or salad also. All their food is reasonably priced, however I wish they had appetizer specials for happy hour. I would drive over there way more often if they did.   Service is good most of the time. At its worst its just decent. One time we waited 45 minutes for our food including an appetizer sampler. It arrived at the same time as our calzone. And it was lukewarm. :(  Um, I think appetizers should take 10 or 15 minutes tops to get to your table and it should be HOT...    That said, Santisis is a perfect place to eat some delicious food while watching a game. Highly recommended.

Dr. Kristi and Dr. Christina saved my beloved cat's life.   My cat was in sudden obvious pain one morning a couple years ago and I took him in immediately. He had a urinary blockage so they had to hospitalize him and insert a catheter.  Both vets were awesome. I was crying my eyes out and they were sensitive and sympathetic.   They helped me work out a reasonable payment plan for the hospitalization.   Two years later my cat is healthy and happy.  I live very far away from this clinic and my cat can't handle long car rides. But I highly recommend AZ avenue clinic for anyone in the Chandler/ Gilbert area!

Ah, Dos.  The old standby. For the last 9 years, it has always been our backup plan when we wanted to escape the newest pretentious old town Scottsdale club.   "I'm bored. And my drink was $10."  "What do you want to do?" "I dunno. What do you want to do?" "Let's go to Dos." "Okay!"  Instantly a mood changer. Cheap drinks, rowdy people, good mix of music. Service is inconsistent. One night it can be great, the next night you can have a total a-hole bartender. Some of my guy friends have had issues with the bouncers.   Food isn't the greatest but it tastes pretty good when it is 1:30 am and you know your only other choice is a long line at a fast food place. Gringo rolls are my favorite.   Great place for the young and the single. My girlfriends and I would have quite the time here before we all became married old ladies.

Ah, Giligins.  A nice refreshing break from the s--t storm called Old Town Scottsdale.   Back in the day I used to get dragged along from one horrid nightclub to another. But on the rare occasion that my friends were feeling like slumming it, we would go to Giligins. And I would rejoice.  Giligins has cheap booze, cheap and tasty greasy bar food, party games, and lots of weirdos. My heart is happy just thinking about it. I have lots of foggy but fun memories of the place. And there was always the Giligins virgin that we got to open the "patio" door. Hehe.  My husband and I dropped by for a lazy Sunday happy hour a while ago. It was dark and cold and had rock bottom prices for beer and munchies. $5 pitchers of PBR! Hells yeah. We were told that dogs are allowed on their recently expanded patio. I guess we will be hanging out there much more often when the weather cools down. :)

I have heard about this place from friends for years and have always wanted to try it. I used Restaurant Week as an excuse.  I wasn't crazy about the atmosphere. And our table was very tiny, cramped, and uncomfortable.  But the food was very good overall. For my starter I got the chopped Stetson salad without salmon. I really wanted the mac and cheese (I'm obsessed)  but it is made with bacon. Maybe they can try putting the bacon on top instead? It's a peeve of mine when restaurants put meat products in their mac and cheese considering it is one of the few veg options. My husband decided to torture me and order it as his starter and he said it was very good. Especially with the spicy tomato sauce on the side. Back to my chopped salad. It was divine! Beautiful presentation, fresh tasting ingredients, delicious dressing. I loved their crunchy "trail mix" in it. Before Cowboy Ciao, Postinos was the only place I would go specifically for their salad. But I might have to make a few trips to Cowboy for this delicious salad.  For the entree my husband got the scallops. He loved them. I got their famous mushroom stir fry. Was it good? Yes. Did I hear angels singing? No. Now, don't get me wrong, I do think it was tasty but not worth the hype. The sauce is what made it good. Delicious, slightly spicy, creamy sauce. Like another Yelper stated, I wish it was served with a little bread, maybe a crostini, to sop up all the leftover sauce.  The mix of mushrooms were nice and the polenta was so-so. A little dry and under seasoned. And I was disappointed with how much avacado and cotija cheese was on top. Barely any, more like a garnish. There needs to be more because it really helps make this dish so delicious!  Desserts were good. Just good. I got the bread pudding. I liked the pine nuts in it. Nice unique touch. My husband got the banana pudding which he enjoyed, however he was a little frustrated he was having issues breaking the chocolate shell it came in. But watching him was quite amusing.  Service was good. Our server was attentive, friendly, and helpful. We will be back, probably for lunch.

Happy hour heaven. What does this vegetarian order from this meat and potatoes place? GREEN CHILI MAC N CHEESE!! That is all I need and all I could ever want. I dream of it.   My hubby and I have never actually eaten in the restaurant area, just the bar. The happy hour is awesome. They have amazing cocktails for about $5 each. The margaritas are so refreshing. They have martinis on special too with decent vodka and gin. I always order a dirty martini and it comes out perfect, with delicious blue cheese olives. And the portion is generous... their is usually enough in the shaker for one and a half martinis.   My husband orders either the Big Ass burger or the green chili pork stew. Both he said are phenomenal with a generous portion but he has a special place in his heart for the Big Ass burger. It is always cooked exactly how he asks for it, which he is picky about. The fries it comes with are tasty. I have stolen many off his plate.  On to the the mac n cheese... it comes out bubbling hot in its own kettle. The top is a layer of crunchy goodness. It is gooey, green, and a bit spicy. It is HEAVEN. I end up scraping the crunchy bits off the side of the kettle. It is THAT good.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the restaurant but the patrons. There is almost always a wait in the bar area of people eager to take advantage of their great happy hour. While some people are nice, some are total A-holes. I don't know if it is the area, after all it is Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, but there is an entitlement issue going on. I have had many people try to snatch a table or bar seats from us when we were waiting longer than they were. We had to stand our ground and things have been unpleasant at times. We are nice people... we have pointed out tables to people who are waiting before us. Unfortunately, most patrons of this bar aren't  nice. I think it would be great if they ran a wait list in the bar area or if the staff stepped in somehow. It sucks having to deal with these snotty and rude people and makes waiting for our table an unpleasant experience.  Once that business is over though, it is a wonderful experience. Delicious grub, perfect cocktails, great service, and nice environment. Minus the A-holes...

My first time here and it did not disappoint!  I never had Ethiopian food before so I had no idea what to expect. First of all, the service was wonderful. Kind and warm and lots of smiles. I love all the authentic decor inside. It is not fancy but it is homey and has some great authentic crafts and pictures to really get a good feel for the Ethiopian culture.  The food was so good. My husband had the fish, lamb, and collard greens. He loved it all but especially the fish. I had the cabbage and potatoes, red lentils, and collard greens. Loved it all as well. The lentils were medium spicy, just right. A little reminiscent of Indian food. The collard greens were mouth watering. Cooked perfectly.  The flatbread thing it came with was definitely unique. Spongy and a bit sour. Takes a little getting used to but its good!   They recommend picking 3 of their "mini" entrees. Each one is a very generous scoop. We each had 3 and we were stuffed. Next time we are just ordering 2 each... it is very filling.   I was disappointed that they only had one Ethiopian beer in stock... the menu said there were 3. I wanted a lighter Ethiopian beer to complement my meal but they only had a dark brew. The selection of other beers they have are limited but good. I settled for an ice cold Stella.  We have to try their tiramisu next time. It is supposed to be the best in the valley.

Much built up anticipation over this place... it's located far from my house and I don't have many veg friends, so I knew it would be awhile before I could try it out. But as a life long veggo I was super excited that there was a comfort food all vegetarian restaurant in the valley, that wasn't too strange. Finally!  It was different than what I expected inside... much more casual I guess. Counter service and fending for yourself over finding a table. I thought the decor was pretty unique and cool though.  I liked the selection of teas and lemonades. The green tea was yummy.  For starters we had the artichoke dip and crab puffs. Both were delicious but we were a little disappointed with the serving size of the crab puffs. 4 little pieces...  3 of us had the Po-Boy sandwiches. I had already tried a piece of the buffalo chicken at Devoured so I knew I would like the sandwich. They did not disappoint! All the components of the sandwich were good. The bread tasted bakery fresh and even the vegan mayo was good! It tasted just like real mayo. The shoestrings were hot and crispy, like upgrades fast food fries. My husband had the no harm chicken parm, which he thought was good but not great. He didn't like the texture of the cheese.  Kinda wish they had a liquor license... a glass of  wine or a brewsky would definitely enhance the meal. It seems like a lot of vegetarian eateries don't serve alcohol. What a shame.  We will definitely be back. There are so many other dishes I want to try!

The only reason I used to come here is one of my favorite bands used to play here.  Thank God they don't anymore.  Overpriced drinks, weird (not in the good way) mix of people.  Never really liked the food.  And not worth the bitchy behavior of some of the more mature female patrons...

The ONLY Mexican chain I like. It seems like Macayos has been around forever. Sort of a Phoenix area landmark.   The salsa is okay. A bit mild and tomatoey for my taste. The "hot" salsa is a joke. It is not even close to spicy. To me authentic salsa ALWAYS has a bite.  Most of the food here is mediocre. What stands out to me and allows me to give it 4 stars are the tamales with the baja sauce. This baja sauce is amazing. Creamy and spicy, the perfect match for their slightly sweet corn tamale.   The margaritas are pretty good too. I like my margaritas strong and was at first disappointed that I couldn't taste the tequila. Halfway through the drink it hit me like a freight train. It must not have been mixed properly.   Macayos is a good place to take out of towners. They will get a kick out of the kitschy, slightly tacky decor. And the food is suitable for gringo tastes.

This place is sexy. Seriously.  The hubs and I were looking for a new happy hour place to drown our sorrows after a particularly rough Cardinals game. Surprisingly Bobby's has a happy hour on Sundays. I was a little apprehensive because the dress code said dressy. We didn't have any clean dress clothes plus I didn't have the energy to get put on anything more than lipgloss. He put on a polo and nice jeans, I put on a sundress and we hoped we wouldn't look too shabby.  Kierland is usually a pain to park in but this day it wasn't bad. Inside was very nice and the lounge upstairs was dark and modern yet had a "Mad Men" vibe to it. If there wasn't a smoking ban in AZ I would imagine alot of cigars would be smoked in this place.  And we weren't shunned because of our casual Friday clothing. There were other sundresses and jeans. It was a late Sunday afternoon though. I imagine it would be much dressier on a late Saturday night. There was a live smoooootthh jazz band playing. Wow. The band was great but I am not much of a jazz fan. Jazz puts me to sleep. Luckily there was great food and drinks to revive me.  I had a dirty martini and a mojito martini. Both were great, especially the mojito martini. Very refreshing.  My husband was delighted they had Moose Drool beer. They had a huge selection of happy hour food. Lots of inexpensive seafood options too. I had a Caesar salad and eggplant rolletini. The salad was good and the eggplant was outstanding. The bread basket had some pretty tasty garlic toast.  My husband had a huge pulled pork sandwich with some awesome sweet potato fries. I don't normally like sweet potato fries but these were fantastic.   Service was great. The bartender seemed to be the only person serving the entire lounge with one runner helping but he was still fast, efficient, and friendly.  Happy hour prices were SUCH a bargain. All that food and drink for under forty.   Here is a tip for all the fellas out here- take your date to the lounge. Even if she is not a jazz fan she will be impressed. It is classy, intimate, and not as pretentious and suffocating as some of the other Scottsdale bars and clubs.  And if you are broke, happy hour is perfect. Buy her a $6 martini, share some oysters and olives. You won't secretly freak out when the bill comes. ;)

My friends have been raving about this place for years so we decided to check them out during happy hour. The interior is beautiful. I normally detest southwest decorating but they pulled it off. The atmosphere was classy yet casual. I had a couple cocktails. The margarita was excellent. Strong and not too sweet. Definitely not a mix. We split the chips, guacamole and salsa. The variety of salsas were great. My husband had the green chili pork and I had the green chili mac and cheese. Both were excellent and large portions for being on the happy hour menu. Service was excellent too. Although it is out of our neighborhood, we will definitely be back.

Rosie's has a great atmosphere, friendly staff,good music, fun locals, and a good selection of ice cold brews. I always have a fun time at Rosie's.   As a vegetarian I have only had a so-so experience with their food. French fries and cheese sticks are all standard, formerly frozen dive bar food. My husband does like their Irish food selection, however.

5 stars for the selection of movies. You can never go wrong with a movie here, they will always be good. I get so sick of the low quality, big budget movies playing at the major theaters. This is the spot for independent and foreign movies!  I am knocking off a star because this theater is in some serious need of renovations! It looks like it hasn't been updated in years.

Eden's grill has very tasty food. Good vegetarian selection.  Delicious rice and falafel. The service is warm and friendly. Its a bit pricey compared to other nearby Mediterranean restaurants but the food tastes like it was made with love.  FYI- You can place orders for their fantastic rice for the holidays. I heard it is amazing with turkey dinners. I plan on it for next Thanksgiving.

I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back.   The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic.  One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day.

I'm pretty angry... I was slightly ticked after our visit last night and fully intended to give Maggiano's a 2 star update. But within the last 5 minutes I went from annoyed to pissed.  Let me start from the beginning...  After a very rough Saturday with a beloved member of our family in the hospital, we were craving some comfort food, and we were in no mood to cook. We had a great experience at Maggiano's last time and we thought the extra meal they provide when you order a classic entree would be perfect the next day, since we knew we would be busy and emotionally drained.  We get there and hear there is an hour wait. Luckily we snagged a bar table and didn't have to wait. We order the overpriced drinks. They take 10 minutes to arrive. My cocktail is pretty watered down. Okay. We understand busy restaurants. Not mad... yet. We order our food. The complimentary bread still hasn't arrived. I thought my starving husband and kid were going to pass out.   20 minutes pass. No server. 40 minutes pass. Our server approaches "Oh, would you like some bread while you wait?" Why, yes. Yes we would.   Another 10 minutes pass. We get our bread. Our cold, stale tasting bread. Luckily olive oil can save even stale bread. My famished teenager ate most of it.  My husband and I both order another round.  Another 20 minutes pass. I got my wine but my husband never got his beer.   A food runner brings out our food. No offered Parmesan or anything. My husband looks around longingly for his beer. We dig into the food. My normally not picky teenage boy said "There's something strange about this food. Can't put my finger on it". He still ate most of it of course. My husband's rigatoni was passable. My eggplant Parmesan on the other hand ... while I appreciate it being hand breaded and not like the formerly frozen discs that the Olive Garden serves, I was disappointed. There were three layers of eggplant. While the bottom 2 layers were warm, the top layer was room temperature. The breading itself was salty and very eggy. It tasted like the first time I attempted making eggplant Parmesan as a college student.  The one slice of mozzarella on top of this mess was not even melted. It had the texture of sliced processed cheese. The sauce was not good ... you know all that garlic that I loved in my previous review? Well, it was still there. But it tasted like stale garlic cloves that were barely cooked. It's like they threw in these awful garlic cloves 5 minutes before the sauce was done cooking. They were actually chewy.   We finally saw our server when she rushed over and threw our to-go entrees at us. Still didn't bring the beer.  A few more minutes pass and she brings the beer and apologizes for her 20 minute delay. My husband said no thanks, that he doesn't want it. She says ok, walks away, then has the good sense to walk back and give it to him saying it's on her.  But don't feel too sorry for us ... the table next to us was seated before we were. They got their food a solid 15 minutes after we did.    I wasn't ready to throw in the towel on Maggiano's. I just figured they had a bad night. After all, my previous visit was so awesome.  Well... after another grueling and emotional day I finally decide to put some food in my belly. Wow, that order of cheese raviolis from Maggiano's sounds pretty good right now. I reach into their fancy to-go paper bag and pull out the entrees. 2 meat lasagnas. One sausage rigatoni. Zero cheese raviolis. I really am ready to call them and scream at them... but it's after 10pm on a Sunday. If I weren't a life long vegetarian I would be tearing into those other entrees. But I'm not. Which is why I ordered cheese ravioli.  No worries. I scanned my near empty refrigerator and pantry. Found some ramen noodles and frozen costco raviolis. Score! I'm sure the Costco ravioli tastes better than their crappy ravioli any day. :(

My husband and I ADORED the Clarendon hotel! What a nice surprise in the heart of Phoenix. Almost a 5 star rating, just a couple of snags.  Customer service was great. We had a couple issues with booking but it was taking care of promptly and professionally. Even on the phone I could tell how friendly the staff was.  Atmosphere is AWESOME! Completely cool blend of retro and modern. I love how they renovated the property. The lobby was cool. The pool area was cool. Even the hallways had cool art and smelled nice. Our room was adorable. Love the decor and the special touches. I know someone else complained about the lighting in the bathroom but I liked it. I got out my tweezers and was able to give myself an amazing eyebrow pluck.   We loved the rooftop deck. We ordered a drink to go from the bar and went up to the roof to watch the sunset. What a great view!  Front desk was wonderful. Most of the bar staff was great too. We went there for happy hour. Our primary bartender wasn't the friendliest and ignored us after we ordered. Our order of chips and salsa never came even after our food arrived. Luckily the other bartender asked us how we were doing and apologized profusely when we told her about our chips and salsa never coming out. They were out within 30 seconds. The food itself was great too. Their salad on their happy hour menu is to die for. I am not a huge salad fan, even as a vegetarian, but I would go back for just for this salad alone. So many yummy unique ingredients. When we finally got our long awaited chips and salsa, we really liked it. But I actually liked their hot sauce more.   The value is really good. Their resort fee is only 20. Now resort fees annoy me just like they annoy anyone else but this one was cheap and included so much.   My only other minor complaint was that we heard a man swearing and cussing someone out on his phone outside our window in the early morning. I guess he was on a construction crew for the street and had nothing to do with the hotel. Still it was annoying. But the front desk was really nice about it and apologized even though it wasn't their fault. They said if we heard him again to let them know and it would be taken care of.  I can't wait to go back for a staycation during the summer and enjoy their pool!!

I finally got to try CPC before an ASU football game last weekend.  When we walked in there were a few other confused looking people crowded in the doorway. We were there about 15 minutes to 6 and apparently there isn't a hostess until 6. So along with the other people we fended for ourselves and my hubby and I found a table for 2. Usually dark and small places make me claustrophobic but I actually liked the atmosphere. It was like a comfy cave. And I loved the fact that I smelled curry in a pub.   It took about 10 minutes to get any service. Which slightly annoyed me because if we would have gotten served earlier we would have gotten happy hour prices on our beers. But luckily the server was great. Really sweet, funny, and informative.   The pasties do take awhile to be made, but that's okay because we had 32 oz beers to enjoy! They have a good, but not huge beer selection.  My husband ordered the oggie which he really enjoyed. He loved the sauce it came with. I ordered the pesto veggie pasty. It was very tasty. The pasty itself it so buttery and flaky. And the filling had Quorn brand veggie chicken which is my favorite brand of vegetarian chicken. So yummy. Next time I definitely want to order a spicier one. Italian style was good but I can imagine a Mexican or Indian one being even better!  Overall, worth the 20 minute trek to Tempe!

Solid, safe, somewhat gringoey Mexican fare... but decent indeed.  I have been coming here for years and usually have a good experience.  We usually hit the Cantina because they have a killer happy hour and lots of TVs with the games on. Lots of nibbles under $5 and cheap beer and well drinks.   Salsa is tasty but absolutely no heat. Even their "hot" sauce doesn't have heat.   My favorite items are the spinach enchiladas ($8 on Wednesdays) and the Mexican pizza ($5 on happy hour).  My husband likes their green chili pork, mini tacos, and the chicken tenders basket ( which drives me crazy that he orders American food in a Mexican restaurant).   Service is usually good but they can get very busy. I think they have one busser for the whole restaurant so sometimes it can take awhile to get dishes cleared or chips and salsa refills. Happy hour seating can be a war zone with crazies ready to kill each other over tables... luckily they started a happy hour wait list in the bar to prevent bloodshed.  I recommend Valle Luna as a place to take out of towners or people scared of Mexican food or spicy food. It is a nice, safe introduction to Mexican food. Or they can commit sacrilege like my husband and order chicken fingers or a burger...

This is our 2nd time at Yasu and we really enjoyed the experience.  It is small, dim, and intimate inside. Decorated very tastefully with unique little touches. Perfect date atmosphere.  Service was very good. Our server was sweet and helpful.  We shared the green beans, miso eggplant,  and avocado roll. Additionally my husband had scallop tempura skewers and the salmon roll. The green beans were phenomenal. I could eat them all day. Eggplant was also very good as well as the avocado roll. Hubby loved his scallops and liked the salmon roll except for how TINY it was.  The only reason we might not return on a regular basis is because of the portion sizes and the prices. The eggplant was around $10. I was expecting a plate full not a tiny bowl full. $40 worth of food and my husband and I were hungry an hour later. I understand that this is a "tapas" place but this is definitely not somewhere to go when you are watching your budget.   But if you do have a little money to burn and you want to experience some delicious morsels of joy prepared by an obviously talented chef, I highly recomend Yasu.

Our fur baby woke up crying in pain and not eating on a Sunday morning. We took him into Vetmed. We usually go to the other emergency vet hospital but Vetmed was slightly less expensive.  The atmosphere is great. Clean, but comforting. They have water and coffee.   The staff is wonderful. They put you at ease and they really do seem to love animals.   Luckily our pup was just fine, it was just a strained muscle. He got some painkillers and we were on our way.  My only complaint is how pricey everything is. It is twice as much as a normal vet's office. And you have to pay up front. I know that it is standard at most emergency vets but it is very unfair for people who are economically disadvantaged. We were able to afford it this time but when we took our pup to a different emergency vet last year we had to borrow money from a relative. What if we didn't have that money to borrow and it was a life or death situation? It makes me sick just to think of it. Just wish emergency vets can think of a solution to help people. Payment plans? Something. Sorry to rant. We really liked Vetmed and we will use them again if there is an emergency... I hope they take this review to heart.

Perfect grocery store for clean eaters!  Whole Foods, although dazzling, is way too expensive for me. I usually wander the aisles aimlessly, picking things off the shelf, then putting them back out of guilt.  At Sunflower, I can stock up on organic bulk items, everything from beans to rice to coffee. I can buy reasonably priced organic milk and humane raised eggs. Decent selection and prices of organic produce. Olives and hummus. Natural and nitrate free meats for my hubby.   And if I'm feeling naughty, yummy bakery items and cheap wine...

TORTILLAS.  You order anything that comes in one of their delicious flour tortillas here and you can't go wrong.  My absolute favorite is their egg and potato breakfast burrito. Eat it with their delicious spicy hot sauce and you can't go wrong. Oh how I wish they were open Sundays. It would be the PERFECT hangover breakfast.  I have had their bean burrito which is okay. I'm not crazy about their beans. I have also had their cheese enchiladas which are not that great.  My husband says their machaca beef is pretty good and their green chili pork.  One of my favorite things to do for dinner for the fam is to order a dozen tortillas, and containers of their beans, rice, and green chili pork to-go, grill or saute some veggies, set out cheese and sour cream and let everyone go crazy. Easy, cheap, and tasty dinner.  I can honestly say that sometimes I just crave their butter tortilla. Yep. Just a warm, soft tortilla smothered in butter and folded up. Excellent snack.

I am writing this review purely on the initial exam I just went to today.  I am 29 and haven't been to the dentist since I was 10. I have felt pain in my gums and teeth for the last year, but I don't have dental and have been putting off a trip to the dentist due to financial reasons. I called a bunch of dentists offices over the weekend and left a message explaining my financial situation and my dire need to see a dentist. Out of the 6 I called only All About Smiles called back. They said their exam (along with x rays) was only $25. They also said they have discounted prices for the uninsured. Score!  The receptionist and dental assistant were very nice. The dentist Dr. Phan was very sweet, gentle, and completely put me at ease. She took her time with me and explained every little detail. She understood my financial situation and ranked my work to be done in priority. I truly felt like she cared.  The prices they have for uninsured are very good, comparable to what they would be if I had dental insurance.   The only downfall is I wish they had more hours! They are only open Monday through Wednesday 9-5 and one Saturday a month. It makes it difficult for me to get in with my work schedule.  Otherwise, I am so happy and relieved I found Dr. Phan.

Sadly, I had to change my review of All About Smiles. I mentioned in my previous review that they have very limited hours. And they are kind of far for me as well.   So I found a dentist closer to me that has early morning hours. Not because of the quality of care I had at All About Smiles. I really liked Dr. Phan. It was just impossible for me to get their with my work schedule.  At my initial exam with my new dentist, he asked if I got X-rays at All About Smiles. I did, so he had his receptionist call them to see if they can email or fax them over to save me some money. They said they could only mail them.   A week later they still didn't receive the X-rays in the mail. They tried another time and still didn't get them. I am tempted to drive over there myself and get them, but instead I am just going to shell out some more dough to get them done at my new dentist's office.   I was going to give one star for this awful customer service but I really like Dr. Phan. She needs to get some better office help. I should have known by how the receptionist was singing along very loudly to the radio in the waiting room that this office lacked professionalism.

Papa murphy's gourmet veggie. I dream about it.  We have ordered other pizzas but this is THE one. My husband has tried their pepperoni and still surprisingly  prefers this veggie pizza. It is piled HIGH with tons of delicious veggies (the good stuff- artichokes, zucchini, etc) and cheese. And it has a tasty, zippy garlic sauce.  Service is always super friendly.  Look for their coupons in the mail. Not drastic savings, but a few bucks off. And tastes better than Dominoes.

I have had the pizza at TJ's a few times in the last few years and always thought the pizza was tasty.  Had it again last night and, yep, still very tasty. Very cheesy, thin crust (not soggy!), foldable yummy slices.  Also had the garlic cheese bread. To die for.  And the biggest surprise... their Greek salad. My friend ordered it and I wasn't excited about trying it. Most pizza joints don't have very good salad. But this was amazing. Very fresh Romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, lots of feta, and olives drenched in delicious tangy Greek dressing. Yum.  Owners are great. Very friendly family run place.

Only reason I am giving Sushi Brokers 2 stars instead of one is the atmosphere. Which is what brought us there. My friend wanted to try it so we dragged our husbands to a date night. It is a fun, lively atmosphere.  That is where the compliments end. Let's start with the food. Ordered a whole bunch of sushi rolls. After 45 minutes they came out. They were mediocre. I ordered fried rice and the veggie lettuce wraps. The fried rice was fried rice. Not bad, not fantastic. The lettuce wraps were the most disgusting things I have tasted. The veggies were SO salty I couldn't even finish them. I was curious about my friend's side of wasabi mashed potatoes. I was sorry I tried them. They were waxy and had a funky sweet taste to them. Everyone was not impressed with the food.  Our server was bitchy and incompetent. She seemed very impatient with us. Didn't bring silverware and ignored us most of the time. The icing on the cake was when we were leaving and heard her bitching out someone on her cellphone in the parking lot. Fun stuff.

I have been to Su Vino twice now and had a great time both times.   Both times we had a tasting and a cheese plate. All the wines are delish. I do agree with other yelpers that they could be a little more generous with the pours. But it's no big deal.   I was pleasantly surprised by the Summer Rain wine. I usually don't like flavored wines, and I loathe wines that are too sweet. And I usually don't like apple flavored drinks. Summer rain was slightly sweet, crisp, and refreshing with just a hint of apple flavor.   The bottles are reasonably priced. So reasonably priced that it's tempting to buy every bottle on the tasting menu! But we exercised self-control and just bought two.  The cheese plate is huge and has a great variety of cheeses and fruit. Everything on the plate is very tasty. They had a wine cheese that my husband adored. They also had delicious olives.  We splurged and also ordered the mascarpone strawberries. Extremely yummy.  Service is great. Our bartender was friendly, down to earth, and extremely knowledgeable. I am picky with my wine pourers because they often can be aloof and pretentious. Not this guy.   Su Vino is a fantastic place for a date night. It is a great way to unwind, taste some yummy wines, share some decadent nibbles, and bond with the person you are with. :)

YUM! I was so pleasantly surprised by this place. I am weary of Mexican food that is smack right in the middle of old town. In many cases they are only places to get drunk or they are super gimmicky.   Cien Agaves had perfect food and drinks while staying reasonably priced.   We were there for happy hour and sat up at the bar. The bartender was completely cool.   I had the tostadas which was an enormous serving and a potato cheese taco. Tostadas were loaded with beans, cheese, lettuce, cabbage and I topped it off with their delicious salsa. When I had their potato taco I thought I had died and went to heaven. My husband had the ceviche and tinga tacos, which he said was excellent.  Their house margarita was on special for happy hour... I'm usually weary of house margaritas. They are either too sweet or not strong enough. But these were great!  We will definitely be back! I want to try their veggie tacos....

Good place to spend a Saturday morning! The organic produce is a little pricey... I usually get mine for half the price at Sunflower market. But the quality is pretty good.  They have some good vendors there. My favorites are...- Dr. Hummus for out of this world delicious but pricey hummus and pita chips. - The Tamale Shop for a unique selection of tamales. Check out their great vegan and vegetarian tamales! - Taste of Taos for yummy and filling breakfast burritos. - the dog treat vendors. I forgot the name but I pick up some pumpkin treats for my pup.  I suggest parking on the street on the north side of the park. We take our dog and enjoy the nice walk across the park to the market.

Soooo good! They used to be located on Greenway and 32nd st, 5 minutes away from my work. I only have a half hour lunch break so I used to rush over their and stuff my face with as much of their delicious food from their lunch buffet as I could in 15 minutes.   But sadly they relocated. We go there for dinner sometimes, not as often as I wish because it is a 15 minute drive. Most of the time the service is very good. The men that work there are very nice but the one lady that works there is kind of grumpy.   The food is mouth watering and delicious. I feel they get the spice levels right. A medium IS a medium. A little bit of heat but you can still taste the food. Favorite dishes are the palak paneer, mali kofta, and the garlic naan. We like to wash it all down with the Indian beer, Taj Mahal.

I am bumping up my rating to 5 stars because this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. We have had a lot of Indian restaurants pop up in our neighborhood but we make the 15 minute drive because the food is so much better than the places close to us. Palak paneer and malai kofta are still my favorites. My husband has recently fell in love with their butter chicken. The last few times we have been there, the service was excellent. My only complaint is I walk out of their stuffed! We buy 3 dishes and have every intention of saving some for leftovers but the food is so good we just keep eating!

5 stars for the basket I got 2 weeks ago. 3 stars for the basket I got today.  My husband and I decided to go mostly organic recently. After braving the Roadrunner Park farmers market (parking a mile away, fighting the crowds, paying a ridiculous amount of money for small bunches of organic produce) and picking through the measly selection of organic produce at the grocery store, I decided to give Bountiful Baskets a try.  I loved the fact that I payed for it in the comfort of my own home ahead of time. It forced me to go pick it up the following Saturday. After waiting a short time in line on Saturday morning at my local park, I was rewarded with a BOUNTY of organic produce. So much I almost didn't have room in my bags. Green leaf lettuce, 2 bags of celery, yellow and red bell pepper, 2 huge heads of broccoli, cherry tomatoes, blueberries, pineapple, bananas, snap peas, mangoes, and kiwis. For $25! All organic! I was giddy the whole way home. Took a picture and boasted on Facebook about my new find. Took my family of 3 almost a week and a half to finish. And it tasted wonderful.  The following Tuesday I tried to order an organic basket, but it wasn't listed as an option. I emailed the organizers and asked why but I never got an answer. And that was almost 2 weeks ago.   Luckily it was available last Tuesday so I ordered it along with a couple of add ons. An Italian pack (onions, garlic, parsley, basil, mushrooms) and 2lbs of granola. I saw the closest local pick up was at 7AM. Yikes. So I asked my husband to pick it up. :)  I woke up to the spread of produce on my counter and was disappointed. Collard greens, a tiny bunch of broccolini, radishes, apples, pineapple, coconut, tomatoes, bananas, grapefruit. Way more fruit than veggies. They claim to have 50/50 fruit and veggies. Hmmmm. On the upside I was impressed with the Italian pack (portobello mushrooms? strange but I will take it) and the granola was PHENOMENAL. Chewy, sweet, crunchy on the outside.    The risk of having a less than stellar basket is worth it. I love the quality and the value of Bountiful Baskets. Don't love waking up before 7AM on a Saturday. But as long as I'm cooking up all this delicious produce, I guess my husband can do his part and pick it up.

Our experience with Chicago Gyros started out a little bumpy but ended up amazing.  After all the rave Yelp reviews I decided to order takeout on a Friday night from Chicago Gyros. I called them. No answer. Hmmmm. I check the phone number and call again. No answer, it just rings and rings. I try calling twice more within 10 minutes. No answer. Any other place I would have given up and ordered somewhere else but I was stubborn and REALLY wanted to try this place. I see on their website they have an online ordering option. I place an order, type in my husband's credit card, click the "ready as soon as possible" option and we start our 10 minute drive there to pick up the food. He gets an email confirmation on the way there, so we assume everything is in order. Well...  I wait in the truck while he goes in to pick up the order. The place is only half full with about 2 people ahead of him in line. I see him talk to the girl at the counter and then come back to the truck with no food and a sour look on his face! He told me they didn't check the online orders and the girl suggested we call in our order instead. My husband explained that we tried calling. Grrrrrrr...   So we wait 10 minutes in our truck for our order and my husband goes back in the pick up the food. The girl was very nice despite everything. He brings the food in the truck and the aroma hits my nose immediately and my stomach begins to growl.    We dug into our hard earned food the moment we walked through the door. I had the vegetarian plate. Yummy! Such a good bargain for all you get. Good hummus and falafel. Amazing babaganoush (sp?). It was so garlicky and delicious. Ok dalmas. I split a side of cheesy fries with my husband. Holy crap they were good! You can't tell by looking at them, but they have amazing fries. My husband had the gyro wrap. It was enormous. He said it was very tasty.   Their food is very good, better than some of the "finer" Mediterranean establishments. And much better value! So good I forgive the whole phone/ email order ordeal.

Good old fashioned Italian.  We had a Groupon, so I made a reservation for a Saturday night. We loved the atmosphere and decor. Service was great. Extremely professional yet warm. We have had bad service before because we had a Groupon but our server was excellent.   The bread before the meal is very good. The foccacia is a bit spongy but very flavorful. I ordered the eggplant parmesean. It was so tasty! The pasta and marinara on the side was good, but not great. My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatball. He LOVED the meatball but had the same lukewarm feelings about the spaghetti.   My husband's beer was reasonably priced but my Reisling was $9 and it was one of less expensive glasses. I wanted a cocktail but was scared away by the price. Their prices on wines and liquor are my only major complaint.   We really, really want to try their Backdoor pizza. It looks amazing!  Overall Aiello's is a perfect restaurant for a date night.

I have been to SRP before for a haircut/ style and had a good experience. I believe Jennifer was my stylist. She did a good job on my hair.  However I am basing this review on a waxing I got last August. I had a groupon for a brazilian and partial leg waxing. The aesthetician didn't have the warmest personality. Her room was nice though. Sometime during the waxing I asked her if she got alot of Groupons and she started talking about how the Groupon people short her out of a tip. A little unprofessional. I assured her I wasn't one of those. After paying her a generous tip and scheduling a follow up, I assessed my hair situation when I got home. She did a fair job, but missed a few small sections.   The real trouble started a few days later when I noticed a few white patches on my legs. I was hoping they would fade but they didn't. Now five months later, I still have those scars.   My friends said I should have contacted the manager about it but instead I am just warning people about their waxing.

Fun, fun, fun.  I am so not a hipster or Scottsdale club hopper. In fact I am most comfortable hitting up dive bars and hole in the wall ethnic places. So it took me along time to try out Geisha even though I have heard about it relentlessly from my "cool" friends.  We had a double date during happy hour, which is perfect for good prices, availability, and people watching.  The atmosphere is pretty cool. It borders on cheesy but it is still pretty fun. I love the pics of the rock starts on the wall. That makes any place cool.   The music they were blasting was a great mix of rock, new and old.   People watching was incredible. Highly entertaining, especially if you are married and in your 30's like me and you want to watch the mating game unfold in front of your eyes.  The sushi was so-so. Can't complain with the half off prices though.  The drinks were really good but I couldn't repeat the names of them to my server without blushing...  Veggie lettuce wraps were good, nothing outstanding. My favorite dish were the vegetable gyozas. They were delicious! Next time I'm skipping the sushi and ordering 2 orders of them. The filling was delicious and they were grilled perfectly. The spicy mustard aioli it came with was perfect.   Service was good. Our server was a typical Scottsdale babe, except she was nice and NOT a pretentious wench like some of them can be.   Management checked on us a couple times to see how we are doing, which is always nice.  We had a blast and will definitely be back...

After seeing some bad reviews I was reluctant to try Bombay Spice. But I am so glad I did!  The food is NOT authentic Indian food. The server even told us when we were sat that it is Americanized Indian food. It is definitely an interpretation. (There was cilantro in my dish...) But as long as you have that understanding before you go, you should be fine.  They had an interesting selection of beer and wine. Unfortunately my husband did not care for his IPA and I didn't love my glass of Pinot Grigio. Luckily, the drinks were the only thing we disliked...  I ordered the mixed veggies entree with spinach sauce. Since the server told me it was Americanized Indian food, I was worried it wouldn't be spicy and I love a little heat. You are able to customize the spice level, thank God, so I ordered it medium. I thought the plating was attractive and enticing. And the food was yummy... Not swimming in ghee so it goes down smoothly. There was a delicious smoky grilled taste to the food that I loved. I wish it came with more naan. The naan was delicious too. Nice and crispy and garlicky. You can definitely taste the olive oil in the food which I wasn't expected to like.   My husband had the chicken biryani. He loved it. The portions are enormous, so I had plenty of food leftover for a yummy lunch the next day.  The service was great. Our server was eager, informative, and just a sweetheart.  Their brunch and happy hour sound amazing. Unfortunately their happy hour ends at 6, so I wouldn't be able to make after work. I might just have to sneak out early...

Beans, beans, beans. Seriously the best beans I have had from someone other than my family.  My carniverous friends rave about the beans here so I was excited to try it for lunch. I ordered the large bean burrito. Duh.   It was everything they described it and more. Tortilla was grilled perfectly and the tasty beans oozed profusely from the burrito. The salsa it came with was okay but kind of bland. But it wasn't really needed. The burrito tastes like the ones my Tio used to make at the restaurant he owned in Santa Ana when I was a little girl. Definitely took me back.  Oh, and the beans are VEGETARIAN. Yes, it is possible to make tasty, authentic refried beans that are not swimming in pig fat!!! Please take note other Mexican restaurants. You can get a whole new clientele by eliminating lard. After tasting America's beans there is no excuse not to make yummy beans without lard.  Last time I went I also ordered their street corn. It was heavenly. Cheesy, buttery goodness with a hint of lime. The hot sauce it comes with is great, but beware, it is a creeper.  Employees are great, and always seem happy to see you.  Why wouldn't you come here? :)

I went here for my birthday a few months ago and was completely floored by the taste of the food. Amazing.  I liked that it was a tapas style restaurant because my Dad and his girlfriend don't (usually) have big appetites, although my husband and I do.  We loved the atmosphere as soon as we walked in. We ordered some delicious sake. And we ordered a little bit of everything. I thought the vegetarian selection was decent.   I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I remember us all ravenously digging into every plate, then greedily waiting for the next. The flavors were phenomenal. We HAD to have more. We ordered another round of tapas and sake. More gluttony followed. My Dad and his girlfriend ate like pigs. But even after about a dozen small plates we weren't filled.  My only complaint is the huge bill at the end. $140. But I do take responsibility for not keeping track of the mounting expense. The small plates seem reasonably priced but you need to order enough to get fill your stomach.   Again we loved the atmosphere. I loved the erotic art by the bathroom. My Dad scoffed, "That's nothing new. Same shit I saw in the '60's." Whatever. My Dad claims he has already seen everything before... at least he was impressed by the food.  I will definitely be back. And give their happy hour a try to relieve some of the burden off my wallet.

Oh Hanny's....  My only experience with Hanny's so far was the after-party of my wedding night. My husband and I, the wedding party, as well as about a dozen additional friends took cab rides from our hotel and somehow ended up there.   Kudos to the staff for opening up the 2nd floor to accommodate our huge, drunk, and obnoxious group of people. The staff was super nice and patient with us. We ordered a few pizzas and I thought they were delicious. They went fast however and they weren't too filling.  I wasn't crazy about some of the patrons. I got quite a few dirty looks on my way to the bathroom from hipster, androgynous females. Maybe it was the veil still attached to my head. Needless to say, they were quite uptight and kept me from mingling beyond my group.

There are so many burger options out there these days. Indulge is another player in the burger bonanza. Worthy player.  First of all the atmosphere. On the corner of an upscale shopping center. A little small and cramped but looked pretty nice inside. We sat outside because we had our dog. They were very accommodating with our dog which always scores points with us.  We had 2 large beers, shared 2 starter/sides, and each had a build your own burger. We started with the french fry/ onion string combo and fried pickles. All were very tasty. I could honestly just be happy with these fried pieces of heaven and a beer.   My husband loved his burger. Said the beef was tasty and cooked perfectly well. Portion was enormous and after eating all the sides he could only finish half.  My burger on the other hand, was just okay. I ordered the black bean burger. My burger was huge as well, but in this case bigger is NOT better. The black bean patty was too big so it was mushy inside. I think if they made the burger a little thinner and crispier it would have made a big difference. The bun and the toppings were really good. I love the wide and unique selection of toppings and sauces.  Everything added up can get kind of pricey. A lot of money for burgers and beers. Almost $50. But they run a lot of specials, Groupons and good happy hours. They have nights when beers are only a couple bucks a piece. And their happy hour has half off appetizers. So if you plan it right it can be reasonable.   We will be back... apps are amazing, service was great, and my husband adored his burger. I think I will give their mac n cheese a try next time.

Hipster alert!  I'm not hating. I'm just jealous.  All joking aside, Sidebar has a chill, dark, modern meets throwback atmosphere. Their drinks are pricey but delicious. I believe the price is fair because the ingredients are high quality and the strength is quite potent. If you want to have a truly good cocktail and some good conversation this is the bar for you. If you just want to get hammered, watch a game, eat greasy yucky food, and crank up the jukebox, (which there is always a time for) there are plenty of those bars within a few miles.   There are very few bars where I can see myself reading a book in a corner by myself... Sidebar is one of them.

Wow! My new favorite happy hour spot!  I was planning on seeing a matinée at Desert Ridge with some girlfriends on a Sunday and we were looking for a place nearby that offered happy hour on a Sunday. Humble Pie has happy hour every day of the week. YAY!  After our movie, we drove across the street to Humble Pie. It is a wee bit smaller than I expected and a little cramped. It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the patio.   We were pleasantly surprised by the HH prices. Bud lights for $2 and ANY other draft for 2.50. And while they don't have an extensive draft selection it is a good one. Specialty drinks were only $4. My friend and I had a cucumber gin/vodka drink that was very refreshing and delicious. My other friend had a cranberry martini. I usually don't like cranberry martinis but I tasted it and it was really good. They sprinkle cinnamon on top which I think is a fantastic touch. It tasted a bit like Christmas!   For food we ordered 2 orders of fries and 2 happy hour pizzas, one margarita and one cheese. Their fries are to die for! They rival the garlic fries at Gordon Biersch. Smothered with garlic, Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Yum. The pizzas were pretty good. Thin crust, flavorful sauce and cheese. We ordered pretty basic pizza so I'm pretty curious about how their more adventurous pizzas taste.  So what was the damage for 4 girls with 4 drinks, 2 pizzas, and 2 orders of fries? Under $40. Such a good deal. And the staff was super nice too. You know how girls can get. Even when the food is gone our mouths keep going and we can sit and talk for hours. But the staff was gracious and patient. They will probably make regulars out of us.

My visits to Pita Jungle consists of mostly hits with a few misses.   The pros- Happy hour is a bargain. $3 for any draft and they have good ones. Tapas are only a few bucks each. Keep in mind these are tapas. The portions are meant to be tiny. But they are perfect for leisurely nibbles. Our absolute favorite among the tapas are the mushrooms. Garlicky lemony mushrooms. Scrumptious. Our second favorite is the garlic dip. We actually prefer it over the hummus. The thyme pita is a good deal. $2 for a giant pita smothered in herbs, feta, and olives.  They have the best coconut curry soup. All their soups are good and usually vegetarian but this one is craveable.   My hubby likes their gyro and their fish dishes.  The cons- Their veggie wrap is not good. I have had it at the other locations and enjoyed it but not so much at this location. Too many carrots and too dry.  My husband didn't care for their chicken. He said it wasn't bad... it just wasn't anything special.  Service can be a bit apathetic. Servers do not look pleased to be there. We prefer the service at the bar. Bartenders are quick, efficient, and pleasant.   Bottom line- we stick to the bar, particularly for happy hour. Cheap booze, tasty nibbles, and a great view of whatever game happens to be on their TV.

My husband and I went to Blue Martini with a few other couples for reverse happy hour on a Wednesday night. We had an interesting time.  The drink and food specials were awesome. Half priced martinis come out to be about 7 bucks but it comes in a huge shaker equivalent to about 2 1/2 martinis. I ordered the mojito martini first, which I wasn't crazy about. And that one didn't come in a shaker for some reason. Hmmmm. But then I ordered the dirty martini. Oh my God. It was probably the most delicious dirty martini I had in a long time. It was topped off with 3 succulent blue cheese stuffed olives. I wanted to lick the glass when I was done.  We ordered some half priced appetizers too which were pretty good. Light and tasty, and went really well with our drinks.  Service was efficient but cold. Our server didn't seem thrilled to be there but she was attentive until towards the end when we lost her for a good 15 minutes when we wanted our tab.   As far as atmosphere... pretty entertaining. Watching drunk middle aged singles interact is always fun. I would not like this place if I were single. Not a really good singles scene for the under 30 crowd.

I went here with my friend and her toddler for lunch a few months ago. It was a Saturday and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Hmmmm. But regardless the food was really amazing. The flavors were very unique. The freshly made pasta melts in your mouth.  This would be a 5 star rating if it weren't for the portion sizes. We only ordered a pasta dish each and no salad, and there is no bread, only those cracker style breadsticks. Which my friend's toddler gobbled up. We were still hungry after our meals. It would be great if they could just get some simple, tasty artisan bread from a local bakery. With the price they charge on their meals, this really shouldn't be a problem.  The service was great, which it should be since we were the only ones. But our server was very nice, helpful, and informative. And didn't mind putting up with the little one.

I was interested in trying this place and was disappointed. The chips were stale. I ordered a berry martini. It came in a lowball glass with ice and tasted like punch. I really did not taste any alcohol. My bean and cheese enchilada was bland as well as the accompanying rice. And the portion was quite small for an $11 entree. My boyfriend thought his seafood combination was okay, however the portion was so small he ordered 2 tacos. This place has potential. I think the decor is interesting and the atmosphere is cool. They just need to liven up their food and actually put alcohol in their drinks.

Great place to go for happy hour and Sunday breakfast. They have $2 build your own Bloody Marys all day Sundays. Breakfast is super cheap and tasty. Chuys also has one of the best strawberry margaritas I have ever tasted.

What a great find! Family ran, homey restaurant. Nothing fancy inside but the food is delicious and the service is warm. And there was belly dancing too!  My husband is on a low carb diet so he had the Greek salad with gyro meat. He said it was delicious and he didn't feel the least bit deprived. I had the falafel sandwich with Greek fries. The falafel was perfect. The seasoning was delicious. And the Greek fries... holy moly. The feta and the sauce that came on them. To. Die. For.   They are BYOB with a $5 corkage fee. Still a great deal compared to the excessive markup of alcohol in restaurants.   Definitely one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in the valley!

This shop makes this tomboy feel so girly.   I am not a big fan of shopping or accessorizing. Other boutiques and department stores are out of my budget and the cheaply made junior clothes found in the malls don't fit my chest or my hips.   Francesca's is my dream come true. A relaxed and unpretentious boutique with clothes of fairly good quality. Tons of cute dresses under $50. Clothes that fit my curves. Lots of accessories. A fun and unique gift section. The salespeople are perfect. Helpful and kind but not pushy.   Woohoo! As good as it gets!

Ooooh, more of a 4.5 rating.  So many wonderful things to say about this place. Thank goodness for living social deals that introduce me to new favorites!  Unassuming from outside. It is located in a run down strip mall with limited parking. But once you go through those doors you are transported to a dia de los muertos paradise. Really cool decor with awesome art on the walls. Love the bathroom doors!  Service was warm, informative, and attentive.   Salsa bar. Wow, what can I say? I consider myself an expert on Mexican food, as a Mexican-American myself and a native of Arizona. But I have never seen these sort of salsas in my life! Peanut salsa? Strawberry salsa? Yum.   My husband had the dogfish shark taco dinner and I had the veggie taco dinner. Yummmmm. Hubby loved his tacos and I had the BEST veggie tacos of my life. The cheese in the tacos is delicious. The beans and rice were great too.   I had their house margarita which was so different and refreshing. It had a hint of grapefruit juice which I loved.  My only (very minor) complaints? They charge for chips. Only a couple bucks but I wish I was warned before I saw it on the receipt.   Also, I saw a tiny bit of unidentifiable meat in my taco. It must have gotten mixed in accidentally on the grill. Hey, it happens, but it can really unnerve a vegetarian.  Love this place. We will definitely be back, preferably during happy hour when I can knock back a couple of their margaritas at a discounted price. :)

Eh. It's a Dunkin Donuts. Luckily I don't go in expecting a lot anyways. The last time we went the girl at the counter was fiddling with the cash register for about 3 whole minutes and didn't even look at us. No "hi" or "just a couple minutes". Nope. Our existence wasn't even acknowledged until she was done messing with the register and looked at us. No greeting. Just looked at us and waited for us to say something first. That's okay. My husband and I are friendly enough for all 3 of us.   I have been over DD donuts for some time now... they have acquired a weird taste. I actually prefer Safeway or Bashas donuts over DD donuts. If I want a REALLY good donut I go to Rainbow Donuts. But DD does have decent breakfast sandwiches. I like their croissant egg sandwich. And I like their coffee.   Meh.

If you can't tell from my other reviews, I'm always skeptical of super trendy restaurants. When the staff looks like something out of an Abercrombie and Fitch ad, I start to worry. In my experience that usually means indifferent service and overly thought out food.  But the food, drinks, and service at RnR won us over.  We went for happy hour. We walked in around 6:30 to pounding house music and gorgeous twenty somethings that were obviously laying around the pool all day. Loud music and food don't usually mix well for me when it is still daylight.  The hostesses were very friendly and our server was great. He was much more down to earth then I thought service here would be. He was wonderful in describing the menu and making suggestions.  My husband had the animal fries and the ahi tacos. His eyes almost bulged out of his head when the fries came. As a vegetarian I was slightly repulsed by this carnivorous mess of a plate, but he was in pig and potato heaven. He liked his tacos too but was slightly annoyed he can eat them in 3 bites.  I had the portabello sandwich. It was good but not great. The bread was too thick and got soggy very quickly by the watery marinade of the mushroom. I definitely want to try something else out next time we go. The parmesean fries it came with were heavenly.   Drinks were good and priced awesome for happy hour. I had a mango pepper margarita. I liked the first few sips but there was something about the flavor I didn't like. My husband thought it was delicious and finished it for me.  If we are in the area we will definitely stop by RnR again. I want to try their boozy Sunday brunch.

Guess who is completely over the Great AZ Picnic? Me!!  My husband and I agreed that this year we would swap our yearly trek to Scottsdale Culinary Festival's Great Arizona Picnic for Devoured. I have heard wonderful things about it. I have been going to the GAP for about 9 years and it has gotten crappier, boozier, and sluttier every year. The first couple years it had up and coming chefs and unique restaurants. Now it has chains and crappy over-hyped restaurants. Is it still fun? Yeah, kind of. If you want to get drunk and people watch and you have a lot of money to do it. One year my friend and I counted the boob jobs. I think we got up to 38... But I digress...  At first we were scared off by the ticket price of Devoured. Then we added up how much we typically spent at the GAP. It turned out to be less and it is in all inclusive price.  When we first got in I was overwhelmed and giddy. It was pretty much a blur after that but lots of fun. Good vegetarian choices, LOTS of wine and booze tastings, Roger Clyne and his delicious tequila, and way less annoying people than GAP. And useful too! We walked out with cards and menus of restaurants we are dying to try.  We got home late afternoon and I immediately fell into a food/wine/bliss coma and didn't wake up till 9pm.

The Vig Uptown has its hits and misses, but the hits definitely outnumber the misses.  First of all, the building and atmosphere is awesome. I think it used to be a Bank of America? They really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor.   The drinks, while pricey, are really good. I had the basil-gin-strawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh. My husband had a tasty IPA he has never had before.   Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant.   When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time.   Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasn't impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo.  Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game...  We do really want to return. Maybe for happy hour or brunch. I want to try their bloody marys and the Amber Scramble. We might even take our kid. But don't worry- he will be well supervised! :)

I am thrilled we found this place. Don't judge this place by its appearance. The stripmall its located in is run down, and the interior is tiny and outdated. But the food is great! I ordered the green curry with tofu which was phenomenal. Perfectly spiced. My bf had the drunken noodles, extra hot, with chicken and shrimp. He loved it too despite the tears running down his face. We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were so fresh tasting and the peanut sauce was soooo good. Our two entrees, two drinks, and appetizer only cost us $22. What an amazing value. And their lunch specials are only $3. The service was great. They are very sweet. Also it is BYOB with no corkage fee. Next time we are taking a bottle of wine or picking up some Thai beer.

Oooooh...  I was a little apprehensive about Rocket. Their vegetarian selection did not look promising. No veggie burger? What?!  We ordered the mushrooms and zucchini to start. Oh-em-geeee! These were home made morsels of joy with a mouthwatering, well seasoned batter.   I ordered a veggie sub and everyone else ordered a burger. The burgers were raved about with every bite. My veggie sub on the other hand? Just so-so. The bread was really good and the quality and variety of veggies was good. Something just didn't work though... I think it didn't have enough mustard/ mayo/ sauce/ dressing. It needed something. And more cheese probably.  We also had fries and cheese curds on the side. Fries were fresh, not frozen. Yay! Cheese curds were tasty.  Soda wall was a bit insane. I'm not a soda person. I was getting a toothache just looking at this wall. I would prefer a beer wall...

Nice, clean updated bowling alley despite the slightly rough neighborhood.  The bowling alleys nearby my house are dirty, outdated, overpriced, and filled with obnoxious teenagers.  I had a Groupon for Let It Roll and went with my husband and son. We only payed $10 for 2 hours of bowling with shoes for an extra person.  We were so pleasantly surprised when we walked in. Nothing fancy but clean and modern. I would rather have something simple and updated then gawdy neon lights and bad upholstery and carpet like my neighborhood bowling alleys.  The front desk employees were friendly and efficient.   They had a great mix of music playing. Hits from every decade mixed with today's top hits.   They have a mexican restaurant inside the bowling alley that actually looks quite tasty. A friendly waitress approached us at our lane asking if we wanted to order. We just ate our dinner so we declined but I definitely want to try the food next time.  As we were leaving they were starting their cosmic bowling with a DJ. We only heard a few songs but the DJ was AWESOME! I was impressed that a bowling alley DJ could be so good. It was practically like being at a club in the middle of Scottsdale. We want to go back with some friends for a fun adults night out.  My only complaint is that the bartender was a bit unfriendly. I understand that sometimes people are having a bad day or moment so I always try to kill them with kindness and most of the time they pull through. Not so in this case. My warm smiles, pleases, thank yous, and good tips did not cheer up this bartender. When I asked for some lemon wedges for our pitcher of Shock Top you would have thought I was asking her for one of her kidneys. But curiously enough, she was friendly with the interesting characters that were obviously regulars at the bar. Hmmmmm...  Overall we had a great time at Let It Roll. I love when I have a Groupon for a place or service and I end up loving it! They made a returning customer out of me.

Eclectic, tiny, delicious, quirky.  We tried Centurion for brunch. I like the cozy atmosphere and how the kitchen was in the same room as the dining area so you can see the chef making his magic.  I was kinda disappointed they didn't have bloody mary's but they did have mimosas. The mimosa had freshly squeezed OJ and was quite refreshing.  My husband had the chorizo skillet which he said was awesome. I had the veggie breakfast sliders. They were kind enough to use scrambled eggs instead of fried, since I don't care for whole yolks on anything. Every component of the breakfast sliders was delicious and expertly prepared. The scones were fluffy and freshly made. The hollondaise sauce, which I am normally very picky about, was perfect. The pesto was bursting with flavor. My only complaint is I wasn't crazy about the combination of all the components together. I didn't dislike it... it just tasted a little odd. And everything except the eggs were cold like they came straight out of the refrigerator. I wish they would have heated the rest of the ingredients up.  Service was friendly, helpful, and laid back.  We are definitely coming back. The chef is very talented and  we met a regular who told us about all the other delicious items on the menu.

I have been to Stand Up Scottsdale 3 times this year and every time we had a lot of fun.   The service is great. The bouncers and the wait staff are very down to earth and friendly. The servers are attentive.   Drinks are good and reasonably priced for a nightclub. They are potent. After your 2 drink minimum you will feel pretty toasty.  Talent is good. Headliners are consistently awesome, my favorite being Fortune Feimster. With the exception of a few duds, the openers are very entertaining. Howard is hilarious. Especially when he tells jokes in Spanish...  My only complaint is the food. The first time we went it was bad. The second time we didn't order food. The third time we went they changed the menu and it looked like it improved. I ordered these fries with a garlic-cheesy topping to it. They had potential to be good but unfortunately they tasted like the frying oil hasn't been changed in days.   Bottom line- Stand Up Scottsdale is a better alternative to the boring date night movie or pretentious neighboring nightclubs. Get ready for your tummy to be aching and your eyes to be watering from all the laughter.

Whhyyyyyy??   Why do I get dragged here at least 3 times a year? The former location off of Shea was a little better but not by much.  Drinks way overpriced. Douchebag factor high. Bartenders and security are rude.   One time I went to the DJ for a request, for some fun 80's hip hop. He gave me a dirty look then ignored me.   I had the food once, and I totally regret it. It was bad, bad, bad.  Ugh.

Nice, sleek, friendly sports bar!  I was pleasantly surprised by the interior. I went a couple of times when it used to be Coppers and I am impressed with the improvements they made inside. It doesn't look like a dive!   Service was fantastic. Super nice servers. However, I do agree the service is slow, which probably isn't the servers fault, rather than a bar and back of the house problem. A beer took 10 minutes to get to me. And our burgers took nearly 40 minutes. (Which is puzzling because the restaurant only had about 6 tables occupied) This would be a problem if you are in a hurry. However, if you are just chilling out and watching a game (on one of their many TVs) it doesn't matter much.   Our food was yummy, much better than the standard bar food. The hubs had a bacon cheeseburger and I had a veggie burger. Both had delish pretzel buns. These buns are sooo good! He had sweet potato fries and I had regular fries. They were also really good. I normally don't like sweet potato fries but these I did like. Nicely seasoned with Parmesan on top.  I had a Groupon so the bill wasn't bad, of course. But the food and drinks are a little pricier than what I would want to spend at a sports bar. And they only have happy hour M-F.   That said, I still will be back! They have a good thing going...

I found another Mexican joint to add to my rotation! Cute atmosphere, cheap booze, friendly service, and tasty food.   I ordered a chili relleno and grilled veggie burro. The chili relleno was good, definitely unique. It was huge and filled with potatoes and cheese and covered in a delicious sauce. As a vegetarian, I love potatoes in Mexican food. They are filling and tasty and I don't see why more places would use potatoes for their Mexican dishes. They are dirt cheap.The grilled veggie burrito was delicious. Filled with beans, rice, grilled veggies (POTATOES!) it was super good. It was a little dry and I would have liked some hot sauce but all the hot sauce bottles were being used by other tables. (Hint, hint... more hot sauce bottles please!) My husband had the bombero burrito which he said was quite spicy but very tasty.   We will be back!

Mmmmmm... mmmmm... mmmmmmm...  That was the sound coming from my husband and I once we got our food at Beckett's Table. Not much conversation after that.  We decided to give BT a try for restaurant week. There weren't too many creative veggie options with the other restaurants and I was intrigued with their dish titled "veggie noshing board". And I knew my husband would have plenty of meaty choices.  First of all, the service was impeccable. Upscale but still warm and friendly. And that is how I could describe every aspect of BT. The environment, the food, the concept. Extremely high quality yet you can still wear jeans. I love the vibe. And all their entrees are under $20.  I started out with the potato/leek soup. It was good. Simple but good. The garnish of pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and roasted cauliflower really made it pop. My husband's starter was a shrimp and black bean dish which he really enjoyed.  My mysterious veggie noshing board ended up being a beet cake with a carrot puree and a medley of veggies with a tomato sauce. I was worried at first. I don't usually like beets and the veggies with tomato sauce looked boring. But the beet cake turned out to be one of the tastiest things I have ever tasted. So delicious. And the flavors of the veggie medley were very good. Clean and tasty. The potatoes in the medley were a little undercooked for my liking, but still very good.   My husband had the pork dish which he was blown away by. He said it was absolutely delicious. The portion size was very generous too. As if he couldn't get enough pork, he also loved the cheddar bacon biscuit it came with.  I had the coconut cake for dessert and my husband had the bacon s'more. Of course, the bacon s'more was a hit with my husband. The coconut cake was good, not too sweet. But I had a hint of a weird aftertaste in the chocolate sauce it comes with. Then I put one and one together when I looked at my husband's chocolate covered bacon. Did they dip the bacon in the same chocolate they used for the coconut cake? Maybe I'm just imagining it but the slightest molecule of bacon can throw a vegetarian off. If they do use the same chocolate I hope they look into changing this... they were so vegetarian friendly in every other way.  They had many other enticing menu items that both my husband and I could enjoy. It was such a pleasant and delicious experience, that we will be back.

I have taken my cat to be spayed and most recently my 6 month old Great Dane to be neutered at PAWS. And I had great experiences with both.  The prices are extremely reasonable. The facility is clean and comfy. The receptionist and the vet himself are warm and informative. No such thing as a stupid question.   They followed up with me the next day, patiently put up with my stupid questions and little freak outs, and left the lines of communication completely open. When I panicked about his incision mark they told me I could text message a picture of it to them and the vet would check it out.   Of course he was just fine, and I am just a neurotic puppy mommy but it was wonderful to have a staff that is so caring and accommodating and doesn't make me feel self conscious at all about my concerns.   Highly recommended!

Yum. Almost perfection.  Intimate, cozy, relaxed atmosphere.  I started with the dirty martini which was very tasty and expertly mixed.  My husband, who is currently on a low carb diet, has a choice of a salad with chicken or the grilled chicken entree. He chose the Greek salad with chicken. He was craving carbs real bad so imagine the mixture of delight and sadness when his salad came in a huge bread bowl. He caved and had some of the bread bowl which I tasted. It was really good-  herbed and buttery.   I had a small house salad and the eggplant rollatini. The salad was nothing extraordinary. Very basic.   But the eggplant rollatini... OMG. Eyes rolling to the back of my head good. Perfect dough... crispy on the outside, brushed with butter and garlic. Filled with breaded eggplant that melted in my mouth. Lots of delicious cheese. And the marinara sauce it comes with may be my favorite marinara sauce in Phoenix. And that's a big deal. The serving size was huge. I could only finish half.  Service was good. Started out a bit slow, probably because they were very busy. But they caught up and were very attentive.  We will definitely be back... I am fantasizing about the rollatini right now as I type...

We had a groupon for Taberna and decided on a whim to use it last night. I was really craving a good margarita.   I didn't know what to expect since the reviews were mixed but I was pleased for the most part.  When we got there on a busy Friday night, there was a 15 minute wait. So we got a couple drinks at the bar. The female bartender wasn't the warm and fuzzy type, but she did make some killer margaritas. My husband had their specialty margarita, served up. It was sooo smooth and delicious and definitely tasted premium. I had a cilantro/jalapeno margarita. It was very good but didn't have as much of the cilantro and  jalapeno flavor that I was expecting. Both margaritas packed a good punch. We were pleasantly buzzed by the time our table was ready. Although they were a bit pricy I would much rather spend $9 on an excellent margarita then $5 on a watered down, crappy one.  Our service started out good. The chips and salsa were very good. The plantains and yucca chips were a unique and tasty touch. After taking our order, our server asked if we want some guacomole along with our chips. We politely declined and I detected a bit of an eyebrow raise from our server. After returning to bring us straws for our water, I placed an order for a glass of sangria and also let her know that we had a groupon. Although the change in her behavior wasn't drastic it was definitely there. We were then often forgotten the rest of the night. We waited about a full 10 minutes for water refills. And my sangria took about 20 minutes. She apologized to me saying that my order was placed last in the big drink order. Whatever.   The food was very good. Portion sizes much smaller than what I'm used too with Mexican food. However, if you imagine most of the entrees as small plates and order a few sides or appetizers, it will be more than enough. I ordered the chili relleno with a side of the poblano potatoes. (Most entrees don't come with sides of anything- another downside.) The chili relleno was stuffed with veggies and cheese. It was much lighter than the cheesy battered rellenos I'm used to. But it was very good. The poblano potatoes were SUBLIME. Everyone must try them! My husband ordered the scallop and pork belly tacos. He was a little thrown off by the size (four bite size tacos) but luckily tacos come with rice and beans. He thought they were very good.   Overall we thought the food was very good. A modern twist on Mexican. However we were disappointed by the service. This has happened before to us with Groupons. I think servers feel that just because we have a Groupon we will be cheap, when we actually tip 25% on average. In fact, when the server brought us our bill she said "Congratulations!" because it was under $1 with our Groupon. Maybe she was just trying to be funny but I wasn't amused. But we still gave her a damn good tip on the original bill, well over 20%.

Yum.  Just got back from Perk Eatery. I wanted to try it since it was new and got some pretty good reviews.  Nice, bright, clean atmosphere. Great service! Very nice and attentive.   My husband and stepson both had the Irishman omelet. They love corned beef and were delighted there was an omelet filled with it.   I had the Mediterranean omelet. So good! Tomatoes, feta, spinach, garlic and a mouthwatering dill sauce on top of it.   The rosemary potatoes that came with omelets were very tasty. Tastes fresh, not frozen. And the rosemary wasn't too overwhelming like they are in other breakfast places. (ahem- Matt's Big Breakfast)   One of our toast options was a daily special, vanilla biscuits. They were sooo good.   Portions were large, so my stepson didn't finish his plate, but my husband happily finished it for him. And I had the rest of his biscuit. :)  Slightly more expensive than the Good Egg, but 10x better in quality. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade.   Now if only they had mimosas and bloody marys...

Fun little place!  We went on a weeknight with our pooch and it was surprisingly busy. I love how they renovated and decorated the place. They have a beautiful patio area. It's nice inside but a bit cramped. A loooong time ago it used to be a coffee shack that I used to go to before I went to high school down the street. Definitely a nostalgic area!   We started out with the bruschetta and some wine. Wine was decent and the bruschetta was awesome. I was a bit disappointed with the portion of the bruschetta though. I'm used to Postinos board of bruschetta with the same price but twice as big. Barely enough for 2 people to share.  We both ordered the entree of the moment which was a shrimp pasta dish, sans shrimp for me. It was delicious. The sauce was so creamy and garlicky. The portion was perfect. However the price isn't listed on the menu and I didn't think to ask. It was a little pricey for a cafe type of environment.   Service was warm and friendly. They were great with my dog which always wins brownie points for me. The food did take a very long time to come out though. The bruschetta took about 40 minutes, entree about an hour. Long time for a weeknight.   Overall we had a great time. I can't wait to come back and have a leisurely brunch with my hubby and pooch. The breakfast items look amazing (reasonably priced too!) and they have mimosas!

Pleasantly surprised.  Nice but casual atmosphere. I like how there were TVs to watch the games but it didn't have that dirty sports bar vibe.   Fast, nice, and efficient service.  Reasonably priced beers. And really good selection of bottled beers. Wish they had a bigger selection of drafts.  We had the fried mozzarella which by husband loved and I thought was okay. I loved the texture of the breading around the cheese but I wish the breading was a bit more seasoned.   My husband had some wings which he thought were really good. And he was happy they made them "extra crispy" for him. I liked that you can order them by the half dozen for just $5. Most places you have to order them in larger quantities which sucks cause I'm a vegetarian.  We ordered a large pizza with Kalamata olives, artichokes, and tomatoes. We liked the pizza for the most part. The cheese tasted delicious on it. I liked the texture of the crust, just wished there was a little more flavor in the sauce. Luckily if you order tasty toppings it makes up for it.  The value of the pizza was amazing. $12 for a large, $2 a topping.   They only had 2 specialty pizzas on the menu, both chicken, which I found puzzling. I was hoping for a few veggie varieties.  Overall, I'm psyched we found this place. We ordered a ton of food and 2 beers for $43. I am looking forward to trying their happy hour.

I really loved FilmBar.  I love the atmosphere... dark and mysterious.  I loved the friendly service.  I love the selection of movies. We saw Rust and Bone which was EXCELLENT.  I love the decent prices of tickets and beverages. The drinks are twice as much at other theaters that serve alcohol.  I love that you can bring in outside food. I recommend something easy to eat if you do this. Carly's Bistro has great sandwiches and they are right around the corner.  Yes there are many hipsters. I have noticed that the Daria/Alanis Morisette angry grunge chick look is coming back... hmmmmmm. But I don't mind the hipsters. It's a movie theater. You don't have to hear them talk. :)  The only thing I don't love about FilmBar? It is too damn far from my house. But it is worth the drive.

Thanks to Humble Monkey, I am now a yoga addict.  I was having issues over the summer with depression and self esteem. I also was having back problems and issues with asthma. I needed something to help and someone suggested yoga. I had been to a small handful of yoga classes before, a couple at Yoga Pura and some at LA Fitness. I didn't have a good experience with either place.  Humble Monkey had a great trial program to see if the studio is right for you. Free first class and only 20 for 2 weeks unlimited. I was definitely hooked after the trial.  The studio is beautiful and intimate. Meghan, my instructor, is patient, helpful, playful, and insightful. Her classic class is perfect for all levels and she makes sure everyone gets an experience customized to their ability.  I am now stronger, more flexible, more peaceful, and have better posture and self esteem then I did before I started yoga classes at Humble Monkey. And I am so grateful...

AZ restaurant week kicked off last night and while there are a few established and well liked restaurants that my husband and I have yet to try, we decided to take a gamble and try Province, which was a little less known.  The decor was minimalist, bright, and trendy but reminiscent of other hotel restaurants. I really liked the bar and loved the outdoor seating. When it cools off a little more I could totally see myself enjoying the beautiful patio.   Service was impeccable. Water refilled constantly, napkins refolded. Our server was great. Professional without being too formal. We were checked on several times by the manager.  The amuse bouche was a very tasty and fresh gazpacho. I appreciate that it was vegetarian since I often miss out with amuse bouches.   For starters I ordered the goat cheese fondue and my husband ordered the corn chowder with crab. The goat cheese fondue was good but not impressive. Honestly it was something I could make in my microwave with just a few ingredients. And I wish they had something different to dip into it, like Crostini or something hardier. Instead they had these cracker/flatbread things. A little too salty. My husband's corn chowder was very light and tasty.   For our entrees I ordered the goat cheese tortellini and my husband ordered a steak dish. My goat cheese tortellini was HEAVENLY. Delicate tortellinis with perfectly cooked vegetables in a mouthwatering broth. Absolutely amazing. My husband enjoyed his medium rare steak but said that one side was cooked more than the other. The artichoke gratin that came with the steak was so good that I kept stealing bites.   The dessert was a chef's tasting of 3 desserts, an apple tart, a squash cupcake with maple cream, and a peanut butter chocolate concoction. I am not a big fan of sweets so squash cupcake and peanut butter chocolate thing was way too rich for me but my husband loved it. If you are a dessert fan you will be in heaven here.   The wine pairings were really good for being house wines.   I thought it was interesting because this woman sitting nearby that was obviously there only for restaurant week was complaining to the poor server about portion size. I was sooo full after this 3 course meal.   Our server told us that they have a happy hour that I'm eager to try in their beautiful bar.

I want a lawyer.  This UPS center has the most APPALLING customer service I have EVER experienced in my 29 years of living.  Let me start from the beginning.  I have had a specific medication mailed to me over the last year or so because it is cheaper than going through the local pharmacies. I have never had a problem. Until last Thursday.  I ordered my medication on Monday. The company said it would definitely get to me by Friday. I have always had it delivered to my work (a school) and it usually gets there 2 or 3 days after I order it. I NEED it by Sunday.   Thursday. No delivery. I'm not worried. Yet.  Friday. Asking my co-workers all day "Any package for me?" Nope. I get out of work in the early evening, rush home, and call the pharmaceutical company. They said it shows that UPS should have delivered it Thursday and someone that works for UPS decided to have it redelivered for Monday. What??? They give me the tracking number and the customer service phone number for UPS.   I call UPS and speak to a very nice man. He says that someone that works for UPS (either the shipping center or the driver- haven't figured it out yet) ASSUMED the school I work for was closed for spring break. They locked up the package.   The person who made this decision is a first class idiot. Guess what bonehead? Every school district has a different spring break! And I work for a private preschool. We have NO spring break! They didn't even ATTEMPT to deliver the package or even call to see if we were open.  Oh the story gets even better.  The nice man I spoke to (not local- national customer service) agreed that this whole situation was f-d up, especially considering this was a medication that I needed. I told him there was no way I could pick it up during there Saturday hours. He said that although the local shipping center was officially closed (this was around 6:30pm Friday night) there are still some employees at the center and I might be able to drive down there (20 miles away) and pick it up afterhours. He said I would get a phone call from the local center within the hour.  After anxiously watching my phone for 40 minutes I get a call from a unknown local number. I answer it immediately after the first ring. "Hello?" Click. They hung up on me as soon as I said hello!!! I call the number back immediately. No answer. I call again. No answer. I do reverse phone number look up just to be sure its them. Yep. It is.  I call the national customer service again. Speak to a nice supervisor this time. Tell her the situation. She puts me on hold to look into it. Comes back on the line and said that the local office said they attempted to call me and had a bad connection. Ummmm... there was no bad connection. The call ended as soon as I said hello. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do about it. I said that was okay, I would rearrange my schedule and pick it up during their Saturday hours. She said I couldn't even pick it up then, because it was going to be locked up and delivered Monday. I went on a major rant. (while still being courteous to her of course- this wasn't her fault) I said I needed the medication by Sunday and this whole situation was terrible, immoral, and unprofessional. She agreed and decided to try calling the local office one more time. She put me on hold.... (this is when it gets REALLY good)  She gets back on the line and tells me they (the local customer service center) hung up on her!!! Yes, the local UPS customer service center hung up on a national UPS customer service supervisor!! By this time I am laughing like a homicidal maniac. She was even shocked by the behavior of her own company. She apologized profusely and assured me she would put a complaint in.   So the medication that was supposed to be delivered to me Thursday won't be until Monday. And I need it by Sunday. And here is another kicker. It has to be refrigerated. Now there are coldpacks in the box. After a 3 day delivery period the coldpacks are still slightly frozen and my medication is fine. But this is almost one week.   Anyone who wants to message me with advice on how to handle this is more than welcome. I don't know where to even start. I feel that if the medication if ruined UPS needs to reimburse me. I am so angry. The laziness and incompetence of these employees are compromising my health.

The hype is true...  Food is incredible, Ninos is awesome, price is on point, atmosphere is clean and pleasant.  We finally trekked over to Good Fellas last night. I do think the name is deceiving... when I think of Good Fellas Grill, I think of an Italian sports bar similar to Santisis Brothers. Not mouthwatering Mediterranean morsels of joy.  Ninos makes you feel like you are stepping into his home. He is warm, friendly, and proud of his food and establishment.  I had a difficult time deciding... I love me some falafel but I was intrigued by the vegetarian plate. I thought I knew a lot about Greek food. I have been to every Greek restaurant in my 10 mile radius and my sister once owned a Greek restaurant. But I have never seen potato cakes or the little stuffed bread things they have. My husband ordered the 2 meat plate which Ninos recommended. Ninos also assured me that the rice and lentil soup were chicken broth free. I love how vegetarian friendly he is.  We were brought the famous soups to start, lentil for me, potato chicken curry for him. I was weary of the consistency at first... the soup looked thin. But it was yummy. I devoured it in about 23 seconds. Hubs loved his soup too.   Dinners were incredible. The potato cake was delicious and slightly spicy. The stuffed bread thing was good and not like anything I have tasted before. I detected a curry taste in them... which I loved. The baba ghanoush and hummus were lick your plate good. The salad it came with was fresh and perfectly dressed. My husband's 2 meat plate had a lot of food for the price. He could barely finish it but he insisted because he said it was so tasty. He said the meat was tender and perfectly cooked.   I can't wait to go back...

Tasty. Unique.   I drive by this location every day and noticed that PV Burger Company replaced 2 Hippies Beach House. I checked out the reviews and my husband and I decided to check it out.  I swear we walked in to a So Cal surfer dive bar. Kitschy decor and ska music blasting. The owner was running the counter and offered us suggestions on the menu. The menu is so ineresting! A variety of burgers, including a country fried one, a parmigiana, and a brioche. All can come with a portabella mushroom or chicken breast instead of hamburger. A few different sandwiches, including a 'pulled veggie' that I'm dying to try. And a bunch of yummy sides.  My husband ordered the brioche burger that includes a fried egg and bacon. I ordered cheese burger with portabella as a replacement. The burgers come with yummy thick cut homemade potato chips but we also ordered fries and sweet potato tots.  Everything was delicious! I love the quality of ingredients, because I believe when it comes to a burger place quality is everything. The brioche buns were delicious, my portabella was juicy and tasty, and my husband was in beef, pork, egg heaven. The fries and tots were good too. The owner let us sample the french toast fries which was quite evil of him because now I want them ALL the time!  The beverage situation was the only issue. They sell soda by the can. They also had fresh brewed iced tea which I enjoyed but I imagine the soda thing could be a bummer for soda drinkers. Would love to see them get a liquor license. If they sold beer (and played some Sunday NFL games) I might never leave!  So glad we found a delicious and reasonably priced funky local joint. I forsee PV Burger Co really taking off!

My husband and I made one of our frequent trips to PVPC tonight and to our delight it was their 1 year anniversary. Yay! A phenomenal local business made it a year and I know it is because of their scrumptious food, super friendly service, and good value.  It's been almost a year since we first visited PVBC and we did expand our horizons a bit. It is so hard to order something new because what you had before was so delicious, you want to order it again! But now I am a fan of their breakfast club, which is a protein packed vegetarian delight. Fluffy eggs, cheese, freshly sliced and fried potato chips, avocado, and mayo all on the recommended whole grain bread. Don't be fooled by the word "breakfast" in this item because this makes the perfect dinner. I have also tried different varieties of their portabella burger. Their gravy is vegetarian and freshly made by the owner... a wonderful addition to a bella burger! They have other great veggie options available... just haven't gotten around to ordering them yet.  Fries are still amazing, french toast fries are decadent.  My carnivore husband obsesses over their weekly burger specials, which they advertise on Facebook. One time we had a burger (me with a bella replacement) with roasted broccoli, carmelized onions, horseradish sauce, and sharp cheddar. Good Lord. Tonight my husband had a burger with apples, cheddar, bacon, and pecan aoli. Really? Their creativity and quality is worth a visit from Guy Fieri.   The owner is wonderful. He is so nice and dedicated to his business that my husband can't hate him even though he is a fan of NY sports. ;)  Next time you want a good burger... or sandwich, taco, salad, etc... don't go to the drive thru, Red Robin, or even the trendy $15 hamburger place. Try PVBC.

This is my 4th time coming to Healing Touch. My previous times I had decent, pleasant massages but today I had a 5 star one!  My therapist was Ginger. I immediately liked her vibe. I have to mesh well with a therapist or I can't completely relax.  I like how Healing Touch has a little card to fill out to indicate your problem areas, goals of massage, and your preferred talking level. I prefer silence so I really appreciate this little added touch.  Ginger reviewed my card with me and reiterated my problem areas. The massage was great. She listened to my preferences exactly. I loved her techniques. She did some stretches on me that felt incredible. She did mostly light pressure but did some deep tissue work on my shoulders as I requested. Boy did that hurt so good! She really seems to be in tune with her clients. Her demeanor is pleasant and positive which is extremely important to me.  The front desk staff is great. Helpful and nice.   The environment is clean, warm, and inviting.  There is also often Groupons and the facility itself runs some good deals.  So why 4 stars and not 5? Similar reasons to the people who gave bad reviews. I understand their frustration. Their hours and availability are bad. I got really lucky when I called to see if there are any openings. The only reason I was able to get in is because I had the day off. They used to be open until 7 and on Saturdays. But they changed their hours at the beginning of the year and are now only open 4 weekdays until 6. Which is great for stay at home wives or someone that works odd hours. But for the average 9-5 person like myself, we would never be able to get in for one of their great massages. I hope they take this to heart. Those 1 star reviews are killing their overall rating which I don't think they deserve. Based on quality they should get 5 stars.  It is a great place with great therapists. I would be there consistently if they had better hours...

Meh.  My husband and I were seeking a super cheap and filling breakfast when we stumbled upon a Hungry Boy's 2 for 1 coupon. How can you beat that?  The layout and building is very strange. I think it used to be a tokyo express or something. Tables are cramped.  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. My coffee was always filled as soon as it was empty.  Unfortunately the coffee sucked and so did the food. The coffee tasted like water and I did not get any sort of a caffeine buzz from it.   The food wasn't terrible tasting but it didn't have any taste to it whatsoever. My husband had the basic egg, hash browns and bacon breakfast. He wasn't impressed. I had the veggie omelet with home fries. The veggies in the omelet consisted of bell pepper, tomato, mushrooms, and onions (which I omitted). Really I think these are the only veggies they probably have in the whole restaurant besides iceberg lettuce. It is that sort of place. Even Denny's has a better veggie selection. I like how they described the mushrooms on the menu as "tender". Haha. That is because they were canned. The omelet had waaay too much cheese in it. I had to pull some out to avoid choking. The home fries had absolutely no flavor.   I did like the wide variety of sides to go with your breakfast. I chose the french toast. Again it had no flavor. And the syrup was watery! Like the coffee.  I never thought I would say this sentence ever in my life but... Denny's is better. I think that (just like the Olive Garden and other mediocre chain restaurants) people who frequent places like this prefer quantity over quality. They are satisfied with overly processed and bland foods. As long as they are supersized.

A couple disclaimers... 1) I despise fast food places and avoid them like the plague. I usually only eat at one on road trips when there is no other food for hundreds of miles. 2) I'm a vegetarian. No burgers or chicken tenders for me. That really limits my choices. 3) I don't really like ice cream. I don't hate it but I'm not obsessed with it like most people are. Yes, I have a pulse.  I leaving PV mall and was trying to get to a pedicure appointment. I saw Culvers and had a weird craving for fries. I pull in their drive thru and see that they have a grilled cheese kids meal. I decide to give it a try despite the sorry excuses for grilled cheese other fast food places have. (Sonic's grilled cheese is a soggy disgusting mess.)   Surprise! The grilled cheese was toasty, buttery, oozy goodness! Don't underestimate the power of a good grilled cheese. This one actually made a crunch sound when I bit into it.   The fries were crispy, salty, and piping hot. Not freshly cut or anything but they did their job.   So even if you are not a vegetarian and don't plan on ordering a grilled cheese from Culvers you can still learn something from my review. I believe you can tell a lot from a restaurant by their grilled cheese... if they can pull that off you are safe to order. I plan on returning with the fam. (Those weirdos are ice cream obsessed.)

Someone pinch me, I think I may be dreaming...  Delicious vegetarian Indian food at a decent price only a quarter mile away from my house???  I can't believe this place has been around for a few months and I never noticed it! Almost perfect, a 4.5 star rating which I will round up because I think it may be the best Indian food in the Phoenix area.  The atmosphere is nothing special. Clean and simple.   Service was good. Attentive and informative. Owner came and talked with us during our meal to welcome us to his restaurant.  We had the palak paneer, one of the crepe things (forgot what its called) filled with potatoes and cheese, and garlic naan.  Everything was delicious and bursting with flavor! Even my carnivore husband was smitten. Our eyes were practically rolling to the backs of our heads.   My only very minor complaints... serving size of the naan could be a little bigger. They only had one combination dinner but it didn't have a curry in the choices. And being the alcoholic vegetarian I am, I really wish they had a liquor license so I could wash down all this delicious food with a Taj Mahal.   Otherwise, excellent. I don't know what the bad reviewers were thinking...  Can't wait to try their lunch buffet!

I was apprehensive of trying this place due to all the poor reviews. However, we were in the neighborhood and I was craving a cold beer and a (veggie) cheeseburger.   We came on a Wednesday night. They had a build-your-own special that night for $11. This is a great deal! I mean, it can get a bit out of control. I wanted to try the mac and cheese but I really wanted a veggie burger. I wasn't going to order both. Soooo guess what I did? I ordered it as one of my toppings! Yes, mac and cheese is an optional topping for the burgers! I loaded up on other good stuff too. Avocado, green chilis, sauteed mushrooms, and a side of tots. Hubby ordered his medium rare burger with lots of goodies too, side of fries.  So of course, my burger was a mess when it came out. That is my own damn fault! A delicious, indulgent mess. I ate the mac and cheese out of it. It was delicious and I noted to myself that I need to come back for build your own mac night. I happily used a fork for the rest of my delicious mess. Their handmade veggie patty was great! And the tots were perfect. Piping hot and well seasoned.  My hubby was pleased his burger was perfectly cooked. He enjoyed his food as much as I did.  The service was great. Absolutely no complaints there. Super friendly. We will be back!

Super comfy place to watch a movie. We come here often because there are many opportunities to get cheap tickets. They often have Groupons for $5 ticket and soda. And any movie after 10pm is only $5.  The food is good but pricey. I had the veggie quesadilla and it was very tasty. But $12. My husband had the burger and said it was good too. Drinks are also very expensive. I guess that's the trade off for being able to drink and eat in a theater. We usually eat beforehand and stick to popcorn and drinks but we are sure to tip our servers well since we aren't ordering a lot of food.   The staff is nice, the seats are comfy and not sardine packed into the theater. If you go on an opening weekend, get your tickets about an hour early and hit a bar or restaurant nearby...

My experience of eating from Luncha Libre was memorable yet foggy ...  I was at a beer festival at Heritage Square last December. After a few hours of countless free beer tastings I was walking sideways and chatting up way too many strangers. My husband went on a mission to find something other than beer to fill my belly.  He comes back with a paper tray and said "Here. Vegetarian quesadillas." I took a bite. 'Angels singing' ... then the heat creeped up. I started devouring it. My friends came over and started tearing pieces off like the rude, ravenous hyenas they are. I turned and ran for cover behind an abandoned beer tent and finished off my quesadillas in a dark corner. Really it was reminiscent of that "Nature " show on PBS. I polished them off and then proceeded to lick my fingers. By the time my husband found me I was in a happy belly trance.  So yes, I will seek Luncha Libra for some more of their delicious food. If they let me after that very un-ladylike behavior...

Instead of seasoned sushi chefs I have been accustomed to, I just got my sushi rolled by a college student. And I liked it.  We had a Groupon for How Do You Roll so we decided to check it out.  The atmosphere is very much a fast food environment, but it's clean and bright. The staff is perky and helpful.  You can create your own rolls, which can be overwhelming or you can choose from some of their specialty rolls. I chose the 2 specialty rolls, one vegan and one vegetarian. Even if you pick a specialty roll they are still customizable and you can substitute, eliminate, or add an ingredient. (One of my rolls came with soy paper instead of seaweed- who would want to lose that salty seaweed wrapper? I asked for seaweed instead.) For drinks, I chose a beer that I picked purely for novelty. The bottle was shaped like a Buddha! I nearly died. We also ordered some miso soup. (I was informed that the soup wasn't vegetarian- it had a seafood broth. I appreciated the heads up but I didn't mind the broth.) My husband had a custom roll with tempura shrimp. We both substituted brown rice for white rice in our rolls.  The servings of the sushi were huge! And the sushi itself was tasty. Not gourmet by any means but decent.   I also love how you can stay on track with your diet. Substituting brown rice and customizing your rolls with healthy fillings keep your rolls under 300 cals. Add some miso soup (only $1) or a side salad and you have a guilt free meal.  How Do You Roll is a very cute concept. I recommend it for a lunch break or a very casual date.

I really love the atmosphere. Cool and unique decor.  We have been here for brunch a couple times and enjoyed ourselves. But we only saw a plane take off once... must not be a very busy airport.  Bloody Marys are awesome here. So tasty, with just the right amount of kick.  Food is pretty good, but the portions are kind of small. I love their veggie omelet with goat cheese. The potatoes would have been good if they were fresh but they taste like they were sitting for a few hours.   They also have a beautiful patio and are dog friendly. When the weather isn't crappy anymore we plan on taking our dog with us for a leisurely brunch.

I panicked when Chuy's went out of business. We were regulars of their happy hours and boozy Sunday breakfasts. But luckily CC's is almost identical to Chuy's with the menu, pricing, and specials.   They still have their free chip and salsa bar, amazing HH specials, dirt cheap breakfasts, and $1.50 build your own bloody marys on Sundays. Woo-hoo!   Food is slightly better but as one reviewer stated portions are slightly smaller.  I think the service is better than Chuy's. They were very warm and friendly.   The strawberry margaritas, while a great bargain, were a little too sugary for me. I miss the mix they had at Chuy's.   Patio is dog friendly! We can watch a game on one of the TV's outside while chilling with our dog at our feet. Order a pitcher or 2 and that is a good time to me.

So happy to see another Indian place pop up by my house!  Bawarchi is a no-frills, very casual, authentic little Indian restaurant. Menu is small but covers most of the basics.  We had naan, aloo gobi, palak paneer, and my hubs had a chicken curry. The aloo gobi was not my favorite. I feel it was mostly onions with very little cauliflower and potatoes. It wasn't bad... but I have had better at most other Indian restaurants. The naan was very good. So was the palak paneer- very yummy. Creamy, spicy, perfect. My husband really liked his chicken dish.   I like that the entrees came with a very generous serving of rice. Some Indian places either make you pay extra for rice or only give you a little bit.  I am disappointed that they recently raised their prices on everything. The picture of the menu you see on Yelp is not accurate. In fact the menu they gave us with our order had the prices crossed out and the raised prices written in. Classy. But the prices are still excellent and a MUCH better value than other local Indian restaurants.   We will be back. Again and again and again....

Just joined YouFit last week. So far, so good.  What drew me in at first was the price. Small registration fee, then only $10 a month. Sweet. Doesn't have the amenities like LA Fitness (which I left a scathing review for below) but I don't really need the amenities. I just need to get my workout on.  I was a little put off my all the purple and green at first, but I got used to it. It is not a huge space but it is efficient and they seem to fit a lot of equipment in without being claustrophobic.   I have yet to wait for a machine. And I usually go during the after work rush.   It is so clean! Yay! I see employees constantly cleaning machines.   The music isn't terrible. Yeah they have some bubblegum pop. But I have also heard some Van Halen as well. The variety is refreshing. Doesn't sound like a middle school dance or a gay club in Tijuana. (Nothing against gay clubs... I have many friends that are gay but the music at gay clubs sucks IMO! Find me a hard rocking gay bar and I'm there.)  Their fast circuit seems cool. I have yet to try it but I love the idea of a full body workout in 30 minutes. The "cardio" portion consists of a step. Hmmmm... would have liked to see some compact cycle machines or something instead.   They don't have paper towels in the bathroom only dryers. I know they are trying to be environmentally friendly and all but I love to cool off with a wet paper towel after working out. My workout towel just doesn't cut it. Just a personal preference.  Staff is nice. They seem to make an effort to be friendly.  Gym goers are not creepy. People of all body types and walks of life. They seem to have the same mentality I do. Just workout and go back to the daily grind. No excessive loitering.  Overall, I'm pretty thrilled to have found YouFit. I dreaded going to my old gym, but actually look forward to working out now.

So much better than Ross. Organized with much better brands. Pleasant atmosphere. Most of the employees are really nice and helpful, with one exception which I won't mention on Yelp...

Filibertos has always been bad but this location is the worst of all. Their service is unfriendly and their food SUCKS.  I have eaten there twice. The first time I ordered a chili relleno combo. The chili relleno was cold. The beans and rice were flavorless.  The second time my husband picked up a couple breakfast burritos. Mine was supposed to be an egg and cheese, no meat. It was loaded with their disgusting pico de gallo (mostly onions) and had bits of meat in it. So frustrating.   Filibertos is bad and they know it. But they will never close down because of the drunk asses that crave bad Mexican food in the middle of the night.  Filibertos is one of those few places in Arizona that give Mexican food a bad name. Shame.

Fun place.  We had heard good things and we had a Groupon, so we decided to give it a try last weekend. A few hiccups but mostly a positive experience.   We walked in to bright colors and loud house music. Hmmmm... not really a fan of either but I kept an open mind.   We were greeted by a friendly guy behind the counter that walked us through the process of ordering. I was impressed by all the options. One thing I found to be particularly annoying was what they called their "Italian flatbread." MALARKEY!! It's a flippin tortilla. Which is fine, I'm sure the wrap still tastes good but they shouldn't try and fool people.   The vast array of meats, sauces, cheeses, and veggies to customize your meal was dazzling.   I had a pasta bowl with both Alfredo and pesto, mozzarella, eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms, and spinach. Yum. My only complaint about the veggie toppings is that they are served salad bar style and either cold or uncooked. Popping the pasta bowl in a toaster oven for a minute or so would solve this issue.   Husband also have a pasta bowl with vodka sauce and meat. He said it was good.  We also had the artichoke dip and the bruschetta. Artichoke dip was not good. Bland and mushy. And it came with also very bland flatbread *cough-tortilla* chips. The bruschetta on the other hand was very flavorful. I was impressed... it tasted like it came from a much fancier Italian joint.   My biggest complaint was that their AC was broken. But we didn't notice until after we payed and my bottle of beer was opened. After we mentioned the heat the guy behind the counter said the AC was broken and they were having issues with the landlord fixing it for awhile. I kind of wish they would have told us earlier or had a sign up for customers. We would have ordered to-go instead. My opened beer couldn't leave the premises so we ate as fast as we could while wiping our sweat off our brow every second.   Despite these minor complaints I really enjoyed eating at Pellinis. Friendly service, reasonably priced, and yummy flavors. We will be back, but we are only eating in if that AC is fixed.

This place is the cat's meow. A delightful experience.  Atmosphere is great. Love what they did with the place. Relaxing and trendy at the same time.  We chose to sit at the bar to skip the wait.  The bartender with the English accent had a great personality ... funny, informative.   We came on a Monday and chose to partake in their awesome $20 pizza and booze special. The wine and beer selection was great and had the same thought and care to it that Postinos has. We had ourselves a refreshing white blend, perfect for a hot and humid night.   We split some polenta sticks to start. They were good but underwhelming. The taste reminded me a bit of the fried macaroni and cheese from TGI Fridays. Can't figure out if that is a good thing... Next time I think we will split a salad to go with our pizza. They look scrumptious.  We chose the pizza with the brussel sprouts and manchego, but without the prosciutto. Yummmmm! Hard to believe I hated brussels as a kid. This pizza can make anyone eat their veggies! The crust was perfect. My husband loved it too and he usually doesn't care for pizza that doesn't have tomato sauce.   Although I loved the wine we were drinking I was insanely curious about their wine coolers. So my husband finished off the wine and I ordered the grapefruit ginger cooler. It went down way too easy. I can see how these can be addictive. And they pack quite the boozy punch.  While sitting at the bar I noticed they have a drive through. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! I almost fell out of my seat. So you are saying I can get one of their delicious pizzas AND their booze to go without even leaving my car? I can enjoy it in my pajamas with my booty planted on my couch while watching my nerdy BBC shows??   We asked if their patio was dog-friendly. Why yes it is. I can picture our dog at our feet on their cute little patio that overlooks Central after the weather isn't hellaciously hot anymore.   So yes, of course we would return. Duh. I would take Federal Pizza over a 3 hour wait and a side of pretentiousness at Pizzeria Bianco any day.

Love the atmosphere. What a cool find. Too bad about the loooong wait for food.  We heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on New Years Day after going to the dog park downtown.   We placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes. Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one, or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary, and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system.   The self seating system can be a little chaotic, and you may have to wait around for people to leave. Many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours. The patio is dog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs, but be warned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.  We polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant. It was perfect. My bloody mary was awesome too, brimming with garden goodness. My only complaint is they are damn expensive. $9. Kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.  The 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait. The staff apologized profusely for the delay. I guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly. Luckily we had the day off and no where else to go, so we didn't mind too much.  My hubby and I both had the egg sandwich, but mine without bacon. It was scrumptious. Every ingredient was top notch. My only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole. The problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion. I DESPISE raw onion. If I would have know I would have skipped the guac. May sound finicky but I scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before I ate it.   We also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum.  The staff is helpful, warm, and a lot of fun. Even with the raw onion issue, the expensive bloody mary, and the long wait for food, the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to sample the rest of the menu.

Yummy! This place is the real deal.  We ordered a large pizza to go. My husband picked it up and said the guy that runs it is really nice and the atmosphere would be good enough for a date night.   The pizza has a perfect thin crust, lots of gooey good quality mozzarella, and a tasty sauce. The "large" is more of a medium compared to other pizza places but well worth the money. I am slightly ashamed to admit that my husband and I polished off the whole thing in one night. It was that good.   I really want to try some of their pasta dishes. If the sauce is an indication of how the pasta entrees are then I am in for a treat!  Look for coupons in the Money Mailer- there are some really good deals.

I'm a dog lover... and a vegetarian. And I think Short Leash is heaven on Earth!!  Stopped here for lunch last week with coworkers who raved about the place. I have heard about their food truck for a long time and couldn't wait to try their veggie dog. I was NOT disappointed!  The atmosphere is great... casual and funky. I love the pictures of the dogs by the bathroom wall. My life's goal is to get my dog's pic up there. Even though we dined inside, the patio looks like a great place to have a couple beers and eat a dog WITH your dog.  The vast array of toppings makes it a bit challenging to order for an indecisive person such as myself. They have a few specialty dogs that take the guesswork out of it, however I'm pretty picky and found things on each dog I didn't like.  I ended up getting *drumroll*... a veg dog with tomatoes, pinto beans, cilantro, and chipotle cream cheese. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!  The naan. *Sigh* As an Indian food lover I have had LOTS of naan in my lifetime. This is the BEST naan I have ever had. Light and fluffy. The dog itself was tasty and all the toppings were fresh and abundant.  The chips that accompanied it were freshly made and tasty.  An eatery that honors people's pooches and gives vegetarians and meat lovers alike a place to get their gourmet hot dogs on? With booze? I think I'm in love.

I adore Crust, and have been anxious to try MyPie. Ironically it is located in the old Sammy Bs location which used to be one of my favorite pizza joints back in the day. They revamped the place with a modern, hip interior. It's a little overwhelming when you first walk in, but the super friendly employees explain the process and make you feel at ease.   I ordered the Greek pizza after much deliberation. I was worried about time because I had less than 30 minutes before I had to be somewhere. But my pizza was cooked freakishly fast. Right after I payed and got my drink my pizza was brought to me.   The pizza was a very good size for a personal. I couldn't finish it. Even though I wanted too because it was deeeelish. The crust was amazing... it rivals a certain pretentious pizza spot with a 4 hour wait. Crispy with just the right amount of chew. The toppings were fresh and plentiful. My only complaint would be that I don't care for the balsamic drizzle on top... it didn't mesh well with the Greek flavors.   This place is going to be put into my rotation. It is a great place to bring anyone... a date, your kids, etc. Also great for a (very) quick lunch. Can't wait to explore more combinations!

I am always SUPER excited when an authentic ethnic eatery pops up in my hood. And Kabab House definitely did not disappoint!  It is right by our house and after passing it countless times we finally decided to pick up some takeout for a late lunch.  I ordered the falafel pita and my husband had the chicken schwarma pita. My husband picked it up and said the family that ran the place is so nice. The guy at the counter even gave my husband a free soda because he felt bad about the short wait for food.  He brought our food home and we were surprised when we opened our food boxes with the enormous serving of french fries that came with the pitas. They were piping hot and sprinkled with a unique seasoning. We were only able to eat about a third of the fries, since our pitas were huge as well. My falafel pita was awesome. Very flavorful. My husband loved his chicken pita and said the seasonings were perfect. They gave us sides of sriracha. That is a restaurant after my own heart.  I highly recommend Kabab House. Lots of delicious food for a reasonable price served by a very nice family.

After much anticipation my husband and I finally tried out the Clever Koi. We had a dinner reservation (which I highly recommend) but we went early to order a couple cocktails and an appetizer during their happy hour.   Cocktails were exquisite. I had the Bees Knees. A gin concoction with lemon, honey, and lavender. It was so smooth and delicious, even my husband who normally hate gin thought it was good. We also had edamame fritters which were very good and paired nicely with our cocktails.   For dinner I had the summer corn ramen and my husband had the Mongolian beef. The hubs was blown away by his dish. He said the steak was cooked perfectly and everything was flavorful. He raved about it for days. I thought my ramen was very good. It had a very light and creamy broth. I prefer spicier dishes and luckily they had a bottle of sriricha on the table. I will try something a little bolder next time. However I work close by and I can totally see myself ordering this for lunch when I'm feeling under the weather and need something comforting.   The service all around was great, from the friendly host who seems to go above and beyond for guests to the easygoing bartenders to our informative server. Although the restaurant was super busy, the staff never seemed to lose their cool and remained friendly and eager to please. We will be back.

I have been to Isa's two times now. I was a big fan of Aiello's and was looking forward to Isa's opening in my hood.  The first time we ordered a pizza for pick up. We ordered the eggplant pizza. It was good yet slightly overcooked on the bottom. And the pizzas are pricey. It was over $20 for a thin crust that wasn't too filling. But still a great tasting pizza. The toppings are high quality.   I ordered their lunch special to-go a few days ago. 2 slices and a drink. They have a good variety of pizzas to choose from for lunch. I had the eggplant and the white. Both mouthwatering. Much better crust this time, not overcooked. There is so much flavor packed into their pizza. Also had one of their garlic knots. They are heavenly.   Great addition to the neighborhood!

I have been anticipating trying this place for awhile and I am so glad we did. It is a really cool concept. It is a bakery and Indian fast food place combined. But good fast food. They have a selection of Indian "chaat" (street food), a couple types of pizza and a couple daily specials which appear to be full meals. We split samosas and their vegetarian tikki masala pizza. My husband also had some sort of chicken hot-pocket sort of thing. The samosas were perfect. Spicy and delicious. The pizza was interesting. It was on flatbread with a masala sauce, covered with bell peppers, onions and paneer cheese. It was good. I wasn't crazy about the flatbread it was on. I think it would be better on Naan. The service was very friendly and helpful. And the prices were amazing.

Hidden gem! I mean, really hidden. It is next to Home Depot hidden behind another building. You would never know it existed. I'm glad I know it exists!  Inside the store, it is a bit cramped. Not much atmosphere. There are many interesting grocery items.  The food menu is small but covers the basics. I ordered a falafel pita for myself and a gyro for my husband to go. We both loved our pitas! I found the pita bread to be very unique. Lighter than most pita bread I have had. Both my falafel and my husband's gyro meat was perfectly seasoned.  The husband and wife that run the place are very nice. The prices are unbelievably low for such delicious food. Highly recommended!

We checked out this place for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. It looks a bit divey but has great food and friendly, attentive service. We started with the spinach dip wontons. These were very tasty. My husband had fish and chips and I had green chili mac and cheese. He enjoyed his fish and chips. I tasted his fries and they were very good. My green chili mac and cheese had excellent flavor. It is not as spicy as I was hoping it would be but I still loved it. I wish they would run it under the broiler a bit to get it a little brown and crispy on the edges. Drinks were good and they had a great selection of beer. My only complaint about the drinks is that I thought they were rather pricey. The nightly specials and happy hour prices of drinks were very reasonable so we are definitely going to return during that time.

This place takes me back in time. In the good way!  We have been there twice now. The atmosphere is laid back and nostalgic. The music is all 70s rock. All they need is a little space for a pinball machine and Ms. Pac Man and it would really be a blast from the past! Service is great too. Both times the person behind the counter was a teenage boy but they were very friendly and helpful.  Both times we went we had the veggie pizza. The toppings are nothing fancy, tomato sauce good but standard. The crust is to die for! Buttery and garlicky. It melts in your mouth.  Last time we went we had a Groupon for a pizza, pasta and Zeppolis. The pasta was good but not as good as an Italian restaurant. I would not kick it out of bed! I put tons of Parmesan and red pepper flakes on top to kick up the flavor.  Then there are the Zeppolis. I am not a big fan of sweets. I rarely order dessert at a restaurant. When these came out I shrugged my shoulders. They were plain balls of dough fried and covered with honey and sugar. They didn't look like they would blow me away. Then I had one. It was delicious! The worst part is they get more delicious the more you eat them. So then you stuff yourself full and feel disgusted with yourself. To avoid this from happening, I suggest you only order these with at least 3-4 people in your party. If I had one suggestion to make, it would be great if it came with a little side of either strawberry sauce or chocolate sauce. Don't get me wrong, they are great by themselves, but this would knock it out of the park.  They have a small but decent selection of draft beers. They have a great special if you get one beer you get the second half price. My kind of place!

Fun, bright hotel with a great staff.  Got a deal for the Saguaro on Sniqueaway and decided to have a staycation with the hubby.   Everyone was so nice, from the front desk to the valet to the pool bartender.  Pool area was rockin'  but not too crazy. Good DJ, good (but pricey) drinks. I love all the bright colors in the pool area.  Our room was tiny but thoughtfully decorated. We loved the little pieces of Arizona history throughout our room. Bathroom was cramped and I wasn't too crazy about the sliding door. I didn't feel like I really had privacy. And the renovations were not that great in the bathrooms. But they had Lather bath products, which was nice.  Like many hotels we had a $20 resort fee tacked on to our bill. But you still have to pay extra for wi-fi. I believe wi-fi should be included in the resort fee.    Overall we had a wonderful time. What a fun way to spend the weekend!

We have been to Haymaker a few times now, once for dinner and a few times for breakfast. I prefer their breakfast over dinner.  We went on a Thursday night for their burger special. My husband thought his burger was tasty. I had the veggie burger and I was underwhelmed. I thought the fries were just average.  We both have never been disappointed in the breakfast. I had their Florentine Benedict every time and I think it is very tasty. I love the hollandaise sauce and the English muffin. Their breakfast potatoes aren't the greatest. Definitely tastes like they were frozen and they have come out undercooked. Not bad, but not good.  Service has always been great. Friendly and attentive. We will be back again and again for breakfast and to try their happy hour.

Eastwind is back in my good graces. The whole fried rice thing was fixed. You can now order half portions of their delicious fried rice, including veggie fried rice! Which leaves room for all their other delectable morsels.  And they have liquor now! Woohoo! I had already ordered my sake bomber before I read that on the menu so I didn't get a chance to order a cocktail. They should create a cocktail menu and throw some cocktail specials on their happy hour menu. (Hint, hint).  A few changes to their menu and food, but all good ones! Still great service as well.

Yikes! I take back my last updated review. They changed ownership and it's NOT good. :(   No more wait service. Instead you awkwardly order at the counter.  Prices have gone up drastically!   Pretty much the same menu but it tastes different. Not nearly as flavorful. My sushi roll was quite sloppy.   No booze! Booooooo. Supposedly they are waiting on a liquor license but if I had a buzz I probably would have been much more forgiving of the experience.   I will still give them 2 stars because the counter guy was nice and the food was edible. But it was a bad experience... Usually when my husband and I hit up their happy hour we pay under $25 for tasty nibbles and a few alcoholic beverages. This time our bill was almost $40 for similar items but not as tasty but without the booze and without table service. Boooooooo!

What a neat little gem! If you would like to take a break from the traditional, greasy Sonoran style Mexican food, give Escobar a try.   Small, unassuming place in a strip mall. Inside casual, yet refined.   We started out with the potato taquito things as an appetizer. Because I'm obsessed with potato tacos and have a hard time finding them in AZ although they are everywhere in California. They were delicious, especially with the trio of hot sauces they bring to your table.  My husband has a combo plate that had steak, a cheese enchilada, beans, rice. He thought it was very tasty. I tasted the cheese enchilada and was blown away about how delicious the sauce was.  I had the chili relleno. It was very good but I'm very picky with my chili rellenos. So it wasn't my favorite. But after tasting my husband's enchilada, I am definitely getting those next time!  Service was great. Warm, laid- back, and friendly. We will defintely be back!
