Checked-in and asked for a cup of coffee. Woman at register was a complete bi!$& and was completely disgruntled and on a huge power trip.  I had to purchase a coffee to go and she threw my card onto the counter.

Wow, the manager's demeanor was brash and he lacks emotional intelligence.  What a cluster trying to get seated at our table. :( On an upside, the food and drinks are yummy, but I always think twice about coming here.

This place is awesome! Honest, reliable, and today when Alton was asleep in the car I called them to see if they would come out and pick up the tire and they totally did. I was able to get my tire fixed favor the transaction all from my car without having to wake Alton up to go inside.

Food is good, not great. Service a bit off and cooks hang at front door smoking until customers come, then prepare food without washing hands.

Horrible care, rude staff.  Receptionist wiped snot from her nose with her hand before handing my ID back to me. Medical assistant doesn't know medical terminology and could barely take a blood pressure. PA seem like you he had a date that he was late for and an x-ray tech handed me my discharge papers and tried to explain how Amoxicillin would help for pain.   Ugh!  Incompetence at its finest. :(
