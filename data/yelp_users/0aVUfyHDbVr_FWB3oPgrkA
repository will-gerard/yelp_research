Last night we ordered take out, chicken Greek salad, Greek fries and the chicken entree. Over all, chicken was very dry/over done. The salad was decent with the amount of vegetables. I knew ordering Greek fries for take out could be a gamble, not as concerned about the disappointment in those, as the other two items. Most likely not to return.

My mother and I visited the spa yesterday for a massage, facial and a wax service.  The environment was very clean, well kept and relaxing. We were offered a beverage before our services, in between and after. I felt very accommodated during my time in the spa and extremely rejuvenated following my services. Suzanne and Heather are amazing in regards to their specific services and their hospitality/service. I recommend this spa for every day maintenance services as well as treat packages and special occasions. We were very satisfied.
