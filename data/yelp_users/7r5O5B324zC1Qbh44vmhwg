Came here with my sister and brother in law for New Year's Eve. What a wonderful decision. We had 7pm reservations and it was nice to arrive and be seated immediately. The place was busy, but very well organized. The food is good, but I have to say it's the overall experience that earns the five stars. Tonight, that experience was facilitated by a very delightful server by the name of Lisa. We had the French onion cheese fondue for starters, I had a Caesar salad. The pine nuts are wonderful, I think they were candied, which added a great sweet and savory component. We went with the coque vin (sp?). It is really a great broth for the entree. We did the cuts and added a couple lobster tails. All wonderful. Then dessert. Oh my yum. We went with the snicker doodle which was chocolate, peanuts, butterscotch schnapps, and baileys. Wow. As if we weren't already full. It was like we were addicts and couldn't stop. Until we realized if we kept going it wasn't going to be pretty. The meal included champagne toast and they gave us each a swag bag which included their wonderful wine salt and a voucher for $25! They also took our picture and we each got a framed copy as a momento. I was very impressed. Usually I like to go all out for New Year's Eve and go out and hit up a party scene. This year I wanted something low key with family and The Melting Pot gave 2012 the perfect send off. I want to give a special thanks to Lisa for being so tremendously awesome. PS - I joined yelp just so I can review this place!!!

I came here the day before Christmas Eve with my family for dinner.  We came in 15 til 5 on a Sunday and were surprised how many tables were open... we were anticipating a possible wait, but my sister who comes here often had prepared us that if there was a wait, it would be worth every minute.  Everything was just so fresh.  My niece and nephew each got  a burger, my father got the spaghetti and meatballs, and my mom and sis got salads.  I had the picnic sandwich with potato salad.  It was awesome!  All homemade, and like I said, very fresh ingredients.  If you're looking for a five dollar footlong, this isn't the place to go.  The desserts looked AMAZING, but are SO big that I didn't have room.  This would be a good place to come with a friend and have coffee and split a dessert.  The environment fits it well too.  Very airy and fresh with a retro jet age feel to it, maybe from all the steel.

I hadn't been back to Liberty Market for quite some time, but every time I'd drive down Gilbert Rd with my friend, I'd point it out and say - UGH! We still need to go there!!  I happened to be off from work one day and we were both up early.  And hungry.  I suggested we go somewhere for breakfast.  Being from California, I remember cinnamon rolls were a big deal, and they seem all that impressive anywhere I've been in AZ.  I did some searches on Yelp and then I just switched it to breakfast, and Liberty Market popped up!  OH SNAP!  The place was busy enough with a long line, but nothing obnoxious and definitely worth the 9 minutes we were in line.  He ordered the breakfast sandwich, I the breakfast quesadilla with chicken, a pitcher of sangria, and a piece of carrot cake to go.  It wasn't cheap.  Tip and all it came out to sixty bucks, but the sangria itself was about 25 - be ready to drop some coin, but don't worry, the place will earn it fa sho!  There was one particular employee who I think was a manager that was better suited for a non customer contact position, like data processing - or worker at DMV.  We didn't let her spoil the morning.  I may have mentioned it on FourSquare and Twitter, but made it clear we were LOVING the experience.  They tweeted back before we even left saying thanks for coming in!  The portions were plenty.  Especially my quesadilla.  It was SO big and SO full I chose to take the other half home so I could tear into it while no one was watching at home. HA!  The carrot cake...  how my hunt went from cinnamon rolls to ending up with a carrot cake, I don't know, but aw lawd it was to die for!  If anything of the desserts or salads on display at Liberty Market are from Cisco, I'd be shocked.  Oh, except for the mixed fruit salad... that looked like it was straight out of a can of Dole.  I can't wait for our next visit.  We left satisfied, not STUFFED, and the whole experience, and sangria, put us in a great mood for the rest of the day.  I recommend this place for coworkers, friends, or even for a fun date before heading to a movie or Golf Land.

Beware of STRICT dress code.  It was really difficult to find this place, it's off a frontage road off I-17 amidst a number of drug infested apartments that have weekly rates as low as $109!  NO JOKE!!  I was wearing jeans, a collared shirt, sweatshirt, and sandals...  My friend and I were meeting a group here to celebrate someone's birthday.  We get to the front and their was no one around, so we stood there for about 5 minutes and some guy with a crooked red tie shows up, looks half awake, mumbles, and in the end says I can't get in because of their strict dresscode.  Meanwhile a guy walks passed me wearing sweats and beat up tennis shoes.  STRICT DRESS CODE??  This place had one chance and they blew it.  The guy was a real jerk.  For that I will NEVER come back, and plus it isn't in a safe neighborhood.  If you come, make sure you have at least beat up shoes and come by cab, you don't want to park your car in this neighborhood.

I wanted so bad to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't, and for one reason: the store bought tortillas.  There are a few things I look for in my Mexican food establishments.  The meat is actually seasoned and flavorful (something two chain operations out here really miss the mark on), the selection of meats offered (let's face it, if lengua, cabeza, pastor, etc are on the menu, you definitely aren't at Fili B's), and I am a sucker for street tacos.  This place hits all three on the head!!  When I read the other reviews I kept noticing yelpers were mentioning the store bought tortillas and I didn't think it was such a big deal...  But it was barely even warmed up!  My burrito felt cold in my hands.  In the future I will probably skip burritos and order a carnitas plate.  The street tacos were probably made with store bought tortillas as well, but they were so yummy and at the perfect temperature, I really can't complain.  Oh, and the two guys on shift when I visited were both very warm and friendly.  I will definitely be back.

I think I found ADF through Yelp! about 9 months ago.  I was looking for a 24 hour grocery store and in the process found this place.  On average, I come to this place about once a week and do the majority of my shopping here.  It's mainly overstock, but they do have a lot of buys that are passed the manufacturers recommended sell by date - NOT to be confused with EXPIRATION.  I actually just got back from a trip now and spent $58.  I filled my freezer with jenny-o lean ground turkey, chicken breasts, and steamer vegetables.  Yes, FILLED.    I also purchased some President brie ($1.99, dated for 8/24/14), artichoke dip ($1.49, dated for 8/20/14), and Carr's table crackers ($.79, dated for 6/11/14).  Of those three items, the date on the crackers is hardly a concern, and all together these alone would have been $13-15 at the local deli section of a major chain.    Their motto says "cut your grocery bill in half," but I'd say I've cut mine about 2/3rd's!!  I give ADF a five star rating based on my experience with the place, but I admit, it is not for everyone.  People who need consistency in their grocery store experiences will go insane here.  What is overstocked and sent here today, may not be available tomorrow.  Also, what is purchased today, might be cheaper tomorrow.  For a minute they had industrial sized ice cream tubs from Swenson's for $13.99 (retail would be about $80!), right now they have lobster tails (4 for about $27).  But it's all always while supplies last.  This place is a perfect go to for people with families.  The prices for snacks, cereals, and lunch items are incredible!    One last thing, I can always tell when a couple is shopping at ADF for the first time.  Their eyes are wide and the expression on their face looks like they are thinking, America really is the land of milk and honey!!

I am a pretty patient guy, and I can understand having to wait when an establishment gets too busy.  I have made genius bar appointments, and I have also just walked into Apple Stores because I was in the neighborhood.  I usually go to the one at Chandler Fashion and have NEVER been disappointed.  I walked into this one at San Tan and I really felt like a number and I felt like I was in need of a personal shopper at Nordstrom's and not in need of a genius bar member at Apple.  I was shoed away because I didn't have a reservation.  Honestly, I was pretty disgusted.  I have a MacBook Pro, I signed up for Beta testing of OS X Yosemite, I have an iPad Air, iPad Mini, and an iPhone 5S.  Well, had an iPhone 5S (long story).  I recently bought a Nokia Lumia Windows 8.1 phone with Cortana, and honestly, after this experience, I might be ready to make a jump from Apple.  The tablet commercials with those cool keyboards have certainly caught my eye.  It's just not a good feeling to walk into a store, see people casually walking around talking to incoming guests, and more or less directing them.  All I needed was to swap out my phone under apple care because of a resin leak.  Anyone could have done it.

I have been to this store twice now.  It isn't the closest to me, but I come here for the service.  In particular, Kelli.  I had a bit of a rocky start with AT&T, received a lot of misinformation and found myself with a substantially lower phone bill than Sprint, but with an iPhone 5S that couldn't be transferred.  I ended up switching to an iPhone 3GS until I'm eligible for an upgrade in 6 months.  The reason I stuck it out is because of the service.  Every encounter I have had with AT&T has been positive.  Kelli in particular impressed me when I walked into the store for the second time yesterday and she remembered who I was.  I showed her my 3GS and we joked about it being a 2009 phone in a 2014 world, and she helped me swap it out to a Nokia Lumia 520.  Something temporary until I can upgrade to iPhone 6.  I really felt like I was being helped by a friend, and working in customer service and sales, that is the ultimate goal.  To establish rapport that will build long lasting relationships.  Even though Kelli will officially be my go-to person at this store, everyone else here that I have encountered has also been very pleasant and they truly work as a cohesive team.  I have only been to one other AT&T store here in AZ, and although the service was excellent, I noticed the service at this store had an organic feel.

This place does no wrong in my eyes.  On a sliding scale of quality versus value, it hits the mark right on target.  Whether it be the lunch or dinner buffet, India Oven has NEVER disappointed.  It appears to be family owned and operated and I have always felt very welcome and comfortable here.  They are very attentive and aim to please.  The naan... it comes with the perfect amount garlic and seasoning and is absolutely scrumptious!  The Tandoori chicken they bring to the table is also not to be missed!  The balance of veg and non veg offerings is also perfect, and the Mango Lassi makes a perfect sipping dessert.  This has become my go to when I crave Indian, and since discovering this place, I can't recall the last time I was at Copper Kettle.  The lunch buffet is $8.95, dinner $10.95.

I bought a same day deal off groupon, $5 for $10.  I went to the venue and ordered a green chile burger combo, upgrading the fries to chili cheese fries and was told my total was $4.08... So, $14.08 for a burger combo in a drive thru??  I asked for a break down just because the last time I had done the same deal my total was less that $10 and I paid a little extra to upsize my drink.  The person at the window was not able to articulate how the charges add up, she just kept saying that groupon doesn't pay tax, groupon doesn't pay tax... it was like dealing with a parrot.  I asked for a receipt and the TOTAL on the receipt was $11.68, minus $10 groupon, $1.68, but then $1.20 in tax, but they ran my card for $4.08, wouldn't that be $14.08!?!?!  Again, "groupon doesn't pay tax, groupon doesn't pay tax, arrr arrr..." Parrot.  I got home and didn't even get chili cheese fries.  I called, spoke with the manager who sighed, said she would refund me and give me the correct order.  No apology.  When I got there my new order was at least ready, but this is unacceptable.  I hate to think how many other people who redeem groupons here are being taken for a ride by their questionable accounting practices.  The chili cheese fries were the most bland I have ever had, and the burger soaked the bun in grease.

This place... Eh.  I found a groupon, $5 for $10.   I called in my phone order, when I arrived I knew to look for the place that had no lit up sign and found it right next to Jamba Juice.  I was quoted a half hour over the phone.  When I arrived they were pretty busy, and looked very disorganized.  My perception was spot on as when I mentioned my name, the guy had to look everywhere for my order.  It was really chaotic.  I don't know what happened, but he said it would be another 10 minutes.  I ordered a medium four cheese pizza and a beef gyro.  The gyro was VERY dry.  Dried out meat and short on tzatziki.  It just was off kilter.  The pizza was okay.  Didn't hit the spot either.  It looked like the large was only 14 inches, the medium is supposedly 12, but I am thinking 10.  I watched one order get called where the guy asked the customer if she had 2 pizzas or 1.  When the lady answered one he began messing with a box and she said, "and it is actually for here, so you can save the box."  He ignored her and slid the box her way and went about her business.  I couldn't help but feel this would be a good candidate for Gordan Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.  Unorganized, poorly cooked, and lacking in customer service skills.  The staff wasn't mean or rude, and the lady that handed me my order gave me a smile.  But they were all just so frazzled.
