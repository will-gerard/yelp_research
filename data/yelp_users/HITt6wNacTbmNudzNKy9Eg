Worth the price! The most amazing, meltin your mouth prime rib and definitely get the chili. My boyfriend was able to cut his porterhouse with a fork. We'll be back!

I have eaten at this location for free the last 8 times I've been there or ordered from them...I think I'm finally done. They can't get an order right to save their lives.  They try, I'll give em that. They've re-fired my order three times to get it right more than once and they've not charges me for to go orders just to get them wrong anyway more than once. Terrible.  If you're looking for a place to eat that doesn't take three hours and three re-fires to get you your food, you're better off staying home and ordering Jimmy Johns.

I loved this place. The food was fresh and delicious. Service was fast and friendly and the prices are fair.  I especially loved the slight crisp to the edges of the corn tortillas. Great addition to my scramble!

Careful! You'll get addicted.  Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.  The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!

I'm a regular at Teakwoods. Great wings, great beer, great service.  I especially love the specials menu, they come up with some really cool dishes.  The atmosphere is really great too, very laid back with peanut shells on the floor. Teakwoods is a place where you can really chill out with friends or even on your own. It's always busy and everyone is in the mood to chat it up.

The best burritos ever.  I get the shredded beef and bean and add extra cheese. These suckers are juicy so make sure you have plenty of napkins. Add red sauce with each bite and you'll be absolutely in burrito heaven!  My babes gets the steak and egg and I hardly ever actually see the thing he mows through it so quick.

Not bad at all, fairly quick service on a Sunday morning if you get in before the after church crowd. Food was fresh and good, prices were fair. Service was fast and friendly.   I had the corned beef breakfast with ranch potatoes, yummy. My boo had a waffle and bacon, awesome.

Cheap, chill, and a total dive. This place rocks.  Definitely the best place for day drinking on a lazy weekend afternoon out on the patio. Save this one for cool weather days.

If you're looking for a good burger, there is no better choice then the Chuck!  I first discovered this gem while attending ASU, and can't get enough. Don't be alarmed by the very old decor, there is no missing when it comes to burgers in this shack with the charbroiled awesomeness and the overflowing toppings bar.  Try the Tijuana Torpedo!

I love this place for their high end spirits selection. Best place to have a smoke and try a good scotch before you invest in a bottle. Their events and tastings are fantastic as well!  The only thing that's a bummer is the cigar selection is sometimes lacking and they don't serve any food.

First of all, if there is any indication that this place might be busy, turn around and find a new place to eat. It's not unusual for the wait for your food to be up to 2hrs!  We ordered a salad and a sandwich to go and waited over an hour for it. The salad came out within 15 minutes, but the sandwich took so long that by the time I was ready to eat my salad it was a wilted, slimy mess. The owner was not helpful at all and we asked her to check on our ticket she just said, "Yeah, it's up there."   This place has a small kitchen and when there is a large crowd it is just possible or them to keep up with the demand.   Crappy service, high prices, and a flaw in organization has lost them a customer.

Most hilarious batch of regulars around! These guys make for an awesome atmosphere.  Not the best selection of sticks, but a nice place to sit back and enjoy what do you find. I dig the boutique brand selection, I just wish there were more to choose from!  BYOB, AC, and good people!

Cheap, fresh, delicious!  A friend of mine introduced me to this little Thai place and it's awesome. I'm definitely coming back. I had the mango chicken and our was so incredibly flavorful! Next time I'll get medium though...mild was too mild.

Sushi delivery!  I know it sounds weird, but these guys are legit when it comes to sushi delivery. They pack the cold stuff in ice and pack the warm stuff separate. All sushi is half off all the time and the minimum for delivery is $20 so you get a ton of food for cheap.  Fresh, delicious, fast, cheap...what more could you possibly want!?

Best BBQ in AZ hands down. The potato salad is incredible and the brisket is tender and moist. They even have amazing veggie options like pulled squash and a seasonal tomato sandwich. Great beer selection too. We'll definitely be back, I want to try everything on the menu!

Great place to relax, have a good beer and a good stick. One of the best stocked humidors in town. Mostly boutique brands, all good quality, fairly priced. Humidor is in pristine condition, no mold or dust. Stock is constantly rotating through with new releases.  Staff is friendly, casual, and helpful. Regulars are awesome. Beer selection is really amazing if you're looking for something that's harder to find or you just want a good variety of craft beers to choose from. If you're not a beer drinker or have a gluten allergy like me there are always additional options. I've seen a moderate selection of wine, mead, champagne, hard cider, saki, and even a selection of wine-based liquors that they will create mixed drinks from. Of course there's always soda, iced tea, and water as well.  The place doesn't serve food, but they have a few snacks for purchase like candy bars, chips, and beef jerky. They also have a book of menus they've collected from the area. You're are welcome to bring in your own food or order delivery right to the shop. I see Jimmy John's guys in here all the time!

Great bar menu. Cheap scotch. Awesome beer selection.  Definitely a great place to have drinks, just make sure you eat before you come. They have the worst food ever. I honestly don't understand how they've received a single award for their food. It's always bland or weird and usually over cooked.  I'd grab a cocktail here any day but I'd get a pizza delivered if I got munchy.

Charming little property. Of the weather is nice it's an awesome outdoor eatery.  Service is great, and prices are good. Food is good quality and testy. Nothing blew me away, but everything was good.  I'll eat here again.

I love this place! Definitely one of my staple lunch spots. I can get my burger wrapped in lettuce and I can add or subtract anything I want so it's always safe for my food allergies.  Highly recommended! Good prices, great food quality, service is friendly, and I have yet to see a mistake!

These are serious donuts.  Hot, fresh, fluffy, delicious...and cheap. I'd recommend any doughnut lover to hit up Golden Donuts. Get a dozen and try a bunch of different stuff.

Bummer...I really tried to love this place. I'm all about supporting local businesses vs. chains, but I won't go back. I've tried this several times and the inconsistency of food quality is a real bummer...  One visit the burnt ends are crispy, delicious, meat candy and the next visit you're served a bowl full of chunks of beef fat. (Brisket varies along these same lines.) One visit the bbq beans are sweat and tangy with robust flavors and the next they taste like ranch style beans from a can. Just not worth it for the price.

The most amazing cinnamon rolls ever. They're huge, super soft, melt in your mouth, served hot topped with icing and butter. Must try!  I also tried the corned beef hash. I was surprised to find that it was real shredded corned beef. I had their red potatoes on the side and they were absolutely delicious. I dunno why they even bother offering hashbrowns, the red potatoes are where it's at!  Service was friendly and quick, no mistakes. Priced were fair, about $30 for two people.

I'm a HUGE fan of this chain, they have the best food. Always fresh, sourced local, and delicious.  Unfortunately this location has repeatedly been a let down with crunchy rice, dry black beans, stale chips, and the guac seems to have been frozen. All watery and grainy. We're gonna have to drive a little further for a better location, which really sucks as this is the closest to our home.  FAIL

The moonshine drinks are great, specials are awesome.  As far as food goes, it's just ok. The garlic fries are alright and the chicken tacos are pretty good.   I'd go back for drinks but I don't think I'd pick this place to eat.

Wow...we finally tried this place and it's phenomenal!  Traditional seafood boils, plastic baggies, no dishes, just ol' bay and big ol' mess. What out for the spices, they can add up and make sure you order one of everything on the menu...at least once!
