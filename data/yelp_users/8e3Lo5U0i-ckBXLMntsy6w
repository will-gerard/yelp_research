I would not even normally write a review for a place like this; you get what you expect normally when going to a chain like this.  I went their recently however and pretty much everything was bad.  The food was so heavy and greasy, the service was terrible, and the waitress was really rude.    On their menu, they have a "Filet Focaccia Sandwich" which is labeled with an asterisk indicating that it is cooked to order with the standard "Undercooked meat could kill you" warning.  I tried to order it medium, and the lady looked at me like I was an idiot, and told me that "It comes how it comes, you don't get to choose".  I don't know if the menu is just wrong or what (I ended up opting for a different dish), but her response was ridiculous.  Even if you like outback, I would certainly not recommend this location...

Let me preface my review with the fact that I did not get an opportunity to try their dim sum because I went on a Saturday.  Their food is fairly average from everything I had; nothing was bad, but nothing was exceptional either.  I went with 4 friends, and had originally ordered a Mango shrimp dish that sounded fantastic.  About 5 minutes before they brought out the rest of the tables food (after bringing appetizers), they told me that they were out of the dish I ordered.  I feel like if they were out of the dish, this could have been told to me much more quickly so I could have updated my order earlier.  This was just one instance of the overall poor service we received.  One of my fellow diners kept trying to get his drink with just a little bit of ice, and only once did he accomplish this throughout the meal.  Every time they brought him a drink with ice packed to the rim of the cup you could see a look of defeat on his face.  Finally toward the end of the meal, he resorted to illustrating about how much ice he wanted using his fingers on the side of the cup.  When the lady returned with a cup full of ice, and Pepsi filled only to the level his finger  had indicated, we all burst into laughter.  To summarize: mediocre food, mediocre at best service...

Let me start with the good.  Their fish seemed fresh, and they have some interesting, well conceived rolls.  Their Scallop Nigiri was fantastic, fresh, and delicious.  Outside of the scallops, their food was 'Meh'.  Had Yakisoba, and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi, because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isn't much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin, it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous, leaving with me mostly full, but unsatisfied.  We were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy, and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning, I don't think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly, but after finishing it, we waited another full hour for the sushi.  Overall I feel they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means, but not worth dealing with the price/service.

OK, this place has always been pretty good, and is great if you know the ingredients/flavors you like, but don't want to cook it yourself (Like at a Hot Pot place).  I have never written a review because I was eating there before I had ever visited Yelp, but recently they added a new "Thai Peanut Chili Sauce" and several seasonings that you can add to your food (IE: lemon pepper, cumin, and some combination spices).  This is a great improvement, and really increased my impression of their overall quality.  With these new improvements, I would say YC's is the best Mongolian BBQ I have personally had.

The sushi here is definitely above average, and very fresh from what i had.  They also have fresh wasabi (Not the food colored horse radish paste); which for me is a huge plus at a sushi place.    My only qualm comes from their roll selection, and 90% of their rolls including imitation crab meat.  It isn't a terrible ingredient, but it should not be in nearly every roll.  What really brought this place up to 4 stars for me though was their service.  Drinks were always filled, people were friendly, and the sushi was made and served as quickly as we could eat it.

This place is pretty fantastic.  Mindfully I have not had much (Read: Any) other Ethiopian food, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but everything I got was very good.  I wasn't in the mood for anything to spicy, so I got the "Mild Combination", which I was very happy with.  Most vegetarian dishes I have had in the past usually have either lacks in texture, or lacks in flavor, but the fosolia I had lacks in neither. It was spiced perfectly, and although it was soft enough to eat similarly to a sauce with Injera, it still had quite a pleasantly solid texture to it.  The Alicha Sega Wat was nice tender meat in a well seasoned sauce.  The only problem one could fault it with was that it was kind of monochromatic if flavor, but that one flavor was delicious, and when eaten with the Injera takes on a layered flavor that made it quite fantastic.  I also got some Kootee (Tea made with leaves from a coffee plant) which was another great new experience for me.  The only thing that wasn't good was the salad, which was made with not the freshest lettuce, but there was so much delicious food, that I was not hungry for it anyway.

Absolutely my favorite Sushi place in AZ.  Everything I have ever had there has been exceptionally fresh, and the staff is always friendly.   They are not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for.

Their Sushi is not exactly the freshest, and the staff looked at me strangely when I asked if they had real wasabi.  I am not sure why you would name your restaurant after something you don't serve :(.

In my opinion the best Thai place in AZ.  Very healthy portions, very flavorful food, very friendly staff.

OK, I HAVE to give this place 5 stars because they server THE BEST Chinese food I have ever had.  Their sushi is mediocre, and so is their service, but their food is brilliant.  Every piece of meat was tender, their shrimp was well cleaned and cooked, and high quality to begin with.  I am definitely going back, I just might get take out next time...

Go there a couple times a week now, and the place is fantastic.  My favorite drink by far to get there is now a Dirty Chai (Chai with a shot of espresso).  Sometimes if I am in the mood for something less sweet I will get just a Latte, or a little less heavy I will get a regular chai.  Everything I have gotten has been great though.  The environment is laid back, and definitely somewhere I would lazily sip my drink over a game of chess if it was closer to home.  It is close to work though, so it is always an in and out run to pickup a pick-me-up.

Pretty good Thai food, although their meat is a tad bit on the bland side.  Their service was prompt and friendly though.

I don't know why but I seem to always crave smoothies on Sundays.  I always enjoy them, but seem to forget until Sunday when most smoothie places are closed; so this place being open on Sunday is a huge plus for me.  I got the Paradise Combo, which is a sandwich/wrap, a smoothie, and a side for $10.  Buffalo wrap and mango/pineapple smoothie were both very good, and at $10 I thought a good deal.  Their smoothies seem to be slightly more on the healthy side with ingredients like non-fat yogurt as opposed to sorbet or ice cream, but the flavor is certainly not lacking.  I am sure I will be returning the next time I have a Sunday smoothie craving.

Really good stuff, although their side selection is limited.   Their fried okra is especially good, because it seemed very fresh, and not like frozen and then fried...

Gigantic menu, tasty food, and good service.  I got a Seafood H Tiu dish, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Not the best I have ever had by any means, but still pretty good.  My only real qualm was the lack of fish balls which normally accompany a seafood Ph/H Tiu.    I know that the fish balls are more of a fusion (Thai/Chinese) cuisine, but whether it is just an Americanized version of the dish that includes them, I really missed them in this dish.

I stopped by at the recommendation of a friend and found the staff friendly, helpful, and expeditious. The coffee I had was just the right mix of strong, and not too sweet.  Their pastries were exceptionally tasty.  They are apparently done by a company called 'Wicked', and Slade Grove (The Owner apparently) was there, and was also exceptionally friendly, and mentioned a Peanut Butter Pudding he was working on.  I am going to have to go back there and try that some time.

It is great that there is a Greek place open 24 hours, but their food is really only mediocre.

I have been there a couple times now, and have enjoyed everything I tried.  I also recently hosted a party and got them to cater it.  Was a hit at the party, and worked out really well.

Tried this place out recently, and had a great experience, partially because of the great service we received.  I ordered Pad Thai, which I ordered mild because of stomach acidity concerns.  The dish ended up having pretty much no spice, and tasted slightly bland.  The flavors that were in the dish were all delicious, but was just kind of bland overall.  I think that if I had ordered it with more spice it would have been more flavorful, but sadly I did not.  Also had an appetizer of fried calamari, which was extremely lightly fried, and tasted like tempura rather than the typical thick batter.  Served with a slightly spicy and sweet sauce it was extremely tasty with or without the garnish.  I think I will go back sometime and try some other dishes, as their menu contains pictures of all their dishes, which all looked very appetizing.

Fresh ingredients, great prices, and hefty portions.  Myself and two other co-workers got sandwiches from here and could all only eat half of the foot-long sandwiches we got because they had so much meat.

Totally forgot to write a review when I initially got my A/C serviced, so I can't remember any details about the experience, but it was a quick, friendly, and relatively cheap (Especially for the weekend) experience.  Will definitely use this service again if I have future A/C problems.

This place is fantastic.  I have tried a couple of things and they were all fantastic, but now I stick to getting a chimichanga filled with machaca because they have the best machaca I have ever had at a restaurant.  The place itself is a small hole in the wall type of place, but maintains a clean and friendly experience.   Luckily this place is down the street from where I work, so whenever I want Mexican food, this is the only place I consider.

I have been to two other locations, but I found out there was a new location opening down the street from where I work, so I decided to try them out.  The food is just as good as the other locations, but the location is nicer, and the people are friendlier.  As good as all their food is, their unique subs are the reason to go (Bobby, Capastrami, Cole-Turkey are my favorites).  They are brilliant combinations of ingredients that I would never have tried otherwise, but they all work out really well.  I also have to disagree with a fellow reviewer that their prices are high.  Their small is indeed $7, but their small is 9 inches, and their large (20 inches) is only like $11.  If you are going with someone else, it is definitely more cost effective to just split a large, but with their level of quality (Fresh shredded 'homemade' turkey), even $7 for a 9 inch I don't think is bad at all.

Random late night craving for burgers led me to this place, and I am glad it did.  They have the best burgers/sandwiches I have ever had from a "fast food" place.  Fresh ingredients, well cooked, and overall a good experience.  I had their BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and also tried their Fresh Albacore Tuna.  Both were delicious, but I was extremely impressed with the latter.  Every ingredient was good on its own, but they really came together in the right proportions in that sandwich.  Lastly I love that they have sweet potato fries, because I am not really a fan of regular fries, and they are a welcome alternative.

This place recently opened near my house, and I love good breakfast food, so I was hoping for it to be excellent.  The first thing I noticed when being seated was that the silverware at our table wasn't entirely clean.  Not a good start.  Overall there weren't too many people in the restaurant (4 or 5 tables while I was there), and there seemed to be quite a few servers.  Our drink order was taken quickly, but took a while to fill.  I got a coffee, and asked for cream when it came out, which also took longer than I would have expected to get.  I ordered "Corned beef hash", and when the food came out, they brought me a "Corn huskers", which is apparently another dish with sausage instead of corned beef.  They took the dish back to resolve the issue and apologized for the mistake.  When it came back out, I am pretty sure they just exchanged the sausage with corned beef on the plate, but since part of the dish was eggs over easy, by this time the eggs were cold.  The dish came with toast, which did not come out with it (Even with the delay), and I feel like if I didn't remind the server, I would not have gotten (Although I could be wrong).  There was also hashbrowns and the corned beef.  Neither were bad per-say, but they were both definitely on the bland side.  I feel like each of the issues I had with this place were small, and could have easily been overlooked on its own (Except maybe the bland food, but I could have tried something different).  The problem was that there were just SO many of them.  The one redeeming factor about the place was that everyone was very friendly.  When the one redeeming factor about a place is not the food, it is hard to justify giving it another try :(.

This place was fantastic; not only is their food great, but you really can't beat the price for meat of this quality especially considering the quantity you get.
