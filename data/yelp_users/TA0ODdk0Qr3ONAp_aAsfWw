What a great place to shop!!  This is not just an antique store. They also sell home decor, jewelry, collectibles and other items as well.  You could spend several hours shopping there and still not see everything.  My 16 year old daughter even likes to come with me.  She always finds something completely unique and personalized as gifts for her friends.  I have read some of the reviews stating that the prices are high and although I have seen a few things on the high-end, I think the majority of merchandise is priced fairly.  It is always clean and the staff is super friendly.  I love this place!!

My husband made reservations for The Compass AZ Grill for our Anniversary dinner.  He planned it so we were sitting just as the sun was going down and the city looked beautiful.  The staff was friendly and our server was top notch.  I had a cocktail called the Compass Pop which was deelish!  I had the Herb Crusted Salmon which was cooked to perfection and my husband enjoyed his Filet Mignon thoroughly.  Our server asked if there was a special occasion we were there for and bought our anniversary dessert for us which was an amazing brûlée banana cannoli dish.  It was a unique, lovely and romantic evening and a place I would definitely visit again!

So thrilled to find a service company that actually puts an emphasis on "SERVICE"!!  Okay, so you won't get a free loaner car, but the cost of repairs for my Beemer was almost half of what I was quoted at Chapman BMW,  so you could rent a car and still be way ahead of the game.  Melissa is an absolute joy to work with. I love paying my bill smiling and actually feeling good about it. Thank you Bills Bimmer/AZ Imports!!

My experience with this dealership was exactly why most people hate dealing with car salesmen!!  My husband and I had been searching for a used MINI Convertible to buy for our Daughter.  I found one online which directed me to Camelback Toyota.  I filled out the online info and was called shortly thereafter by Joseph.  I explained what we were looking for and he assured me this car was in great condition and to come on down.  I said we would be in that afternoon.  Not even 20 minutes later, I received a call from his manager asking if we were coming in or not.  I said I had just gotten off the phone with him a short time ago and that we were going to see several cars that day, but would be in that afternoon.    We decided to go to this dealership first and the second I opened my car door, I saw them coming at me like vultures!  I told them I was looking for Joseph.  They led me to another man (I can't remember his name) because they said Joseph was busy.  So I had to explain all over again what we were looking for.  They led us to the MINI and told my daughter to get in and start it up... She got in and turned the key...it did not turn over.  The battery was dead.  We spent the next 20 minutes watching several of the men try to figure out how pop the hood open and then how to actually open it.  It was comical and aggravating to say the least.  Meanwhile, we noticed how badly scuffed up the rims were and how faded the side panel was.  All while they are telling us that only about 1% of what actually gets traded in makes it to the showroom floor because they have such high standards.  Once they finally jump-started the car we went for a test drive.  Now, no offense to the salesman, but he was a "BIG" guy.  He barely fit into the seat of this car and made the (already tight) ride very uncomfortable.  He spent the entire test-drive (sitting half sideways and crammed) talking and fiddling with all the knobs trying to figure out what everything does.  The car was driving with a lot of vibration and seemed very shaky. My husband was driving and trying to hear the engine etc. (doing his due diligence) and the salesman was cranking up the radio, showing off the "awesome" sound-system.  He was so obnoxious.  My daughter and I were sitting in the back noticing the fine details, like the broken drink holders and missing parts. FINALLY, the test drive ended.  They immediately whisked us into the showroom and asked us what they could do to help us get into the car today?  We explained that we had several other cars to look at and that this was the first one we test drove, and weren't overly thrilled with it, and that we were patient buyers.  The next thing we know, there were 2 men at our table trying to persuade us... and then 3!!  It was ridiculous.  We asked to see the CarFax and saw that it already had 3 owners and was originally from the northwest, insuring that it had seen some years of snow.  That immediately ruled it out for us.  We explained we were not interested and the second we did, the Salesman got an attitude and left the table without saying a word.  We couldn't wait to get out of there!!    My husband and I have bought many cars through the years.  We have dealt with both "Good and Bad" dealers.  This is one I would say stay far, far away from.  I will follow-up to say that the next dealership we went to (BMW North Scottsdale) was a night-and-day comparison... as was the MINI that they had.  It was beautiful and well-kept and drove nicely... and started on the first try.  More importantly, they were low-pressure.  They listened to our questions and answered them too.  And I might add, we got an amazing deal on this (superior) car for THOUSANDS less than what Camelback Toyota was asking.

I have yet to go here without there being a long line/wait... but I suppose that should tell you something about the place, right?  They have a great, fresh menu and I love the seasonal salads!  My daughter is addicted to their chicken strips though I tasted them once and felt they were a bit bland.  The service is good and well organized for such a busy place. The portions are generous and prices are fair.  I always plan on tasting more of what is on their extensive menu, but I end up getting hung up on the salads and never make it much further. :)

I will never understand how the person who pulls in behind me ends up 4 cars in front of me going through the car wash. No worries, I have an hour to waste while I wait for  my car to be washed. Typical day at Danny's car wash. But what do you expect for $20!!!  (Sigh). Wish there were other options nearby but Danny's seems to have the monopoly on car washes... Sadly.  If the job they did was great, I really wouldn't complain, but they are mediocre at best.

I love this place. Every time I order one thing, I see all the other plates coming out and think "oh, next time I will have to try that one!"   Everything is fresh and so tasty!  Service is overall good. My one complaint (keeping me from 5 stars) is sometimes the music is played a bit too loud making conversation difficult.

My first experience with Priority Pet Hospital was at one of the most sad times of pet ownership.  Our 13 year old Shih-Tzu, Oscar, needed to be put to sleep.  Of course, it was not something I was looking forward to, but was dreading even more after several bad experiences in our past.  Just a few days before, I had been talking to a friend, who sadly had to lay her sweet Bella to rest just a few weeks prior, and she told me about Priority Pet Hospital and Dr. Burns.  She said they made the entire experience more bearable and she was right. We were greeted by the friendly staff and led into a private room.  Dr. Burns met us in the room and was incredibly compassionate.  Although emotional, the entire process was night and day to our past experiences.  They proceeded at a pace that was comfortable for us and said we could stay in the room with him as long as we needed to... even after he was gone.   I miss our sweet Oscar so incredibly much.  But I felt the process was very humane and I truly felt like these people cared and at such a heartbreaking time in our lives, that was most important.  They even followed up with a sympathy card where they took to time to hand-write a very sweet message.  I plan on making this our vet hospital of choice.  Our next visit should be a very happy one when we choose to welcome the next puppy into our home.  Thank you Priority Pet Hospital.  Your sympathy and compassion was very much felt and so very much appreciated!!

Wow!  This was honestly the best, easiest and most comfortable car-buying experience I have ever had!! Our son was ready to purchase a new vehicle and take on payments for the first time.  We were actually on our way to another dealership to see something he had liked online, but were sidetracked when we saw all the cars in the Carmax lot.  So we decided to look there first.  My husband and I both let out a sigh when we realized the whole lot was gated and you actually had to go through the main building to access it.  The dread of the "attack of the Salesman" overtook us, but we went in anyway.  To our surprise, we were not trampled by hungry wolves, but instead greeted by a very sweet girl who asked if we had ever been there before.  When we said "no" she explained how everything was set up on their lot, so we would know which section to focus on for what my son was looking for.  She explained that each and every car was unlocked and we could open doors, and sit in them etc.  Each car had a very clean and concise explanation of features on the window which also included the price and then estimates of what a potential payment was based on your downpayment.  We were out there for quite some time, thoroughly enjoying the fact that we were not being pressured, hassled or harassed in any way.  Our son ended up finding something he liked and that he felt he could afford monthly payments on.  We then went inside and were introduced to our Salesman.  His name escapes me at the moment, but if/when I remember, I will update it. He was great.  We sat down to do the application, which was all online and took only a few minutes to complete.  When terms were agreed upon and he said we needed to finish everything up at finance,  I again, was anticipating a long drawn out process.  I asked how long everything would take and his response was "About 20 minutes."  Really?  We are used to this taking hours!!  He was not lying.  We were in and out of there in no time.  Then, when they pulled my son's truck up, they put a huge bow on it which made it seem extra special.  Really satisfied with the whole experience from entry to exit.  They couldn't have made it easier.  I will follow up to say that his truck had two minor issues that we noted when purchasing.  They told us to bring it in during the first 30 days and they would fix them for free... and they did!!  1st rate!

One of my favorite "self-serve" yogurt places!  A good selection, always squeaky clean, super cute decor and a friendly staff to boot.  I'd say more, but I have a sudden craving for some yogurt and am heading out the door! :)

This is the WORST service department I have ever dealt with. Sloppy and poor customer service AND they damaged my car after having it for two weeks!  When it was brought to their attention, they did not acknowledge or deny it  attempted to "repair" it, but it should have been replaced  More than once I have requested they inspect one thing (like the brakes) and have been told they will need to do a full inspection... For a mere $700. This place is a joke... Definitely not the high- end service one would expect with the BMW name. Boooooooo.

Nothing has improved. Every time I have brought my car in for service, I bring it home with the problem not fixed or another problem created. I purchased a new navigation DVD for $200', only to get home and see it wasn't working. They never checked it and it was a defective DVD. That is just one example of many things they have not completed properly. Looks like I am going to take the long route and start bringing my car  to BMW North Scottsdale. Hopefully, I will have better luck.

I would advise you to stay far, far away from here.  My 20 year old son was in need of a rebuilt transmission.  Aamco was the second opinion, and although they were several hundred dollars higher than our previous quote, we figured that these were the "experts" and that the price could be justified.  We were told that a rebuilt transmission should last for quite some time and again we thought the $2300 investment was a good one.  7 months later, on a trip back from California, his car started bleeding red fluid everywhere and he had to be towed to the nearest Aamco which was in Redlands, CA.  They said the transmission had blown up and was no good.  They contacted the Gilbert Aamco because it had been rebuilt so recently, and they were told that he was 2,000 miles over the  12,000 mile warranty and they were not willing to do anything about it. NOTHING.  Really??  7 months on a $2300 repair?  Mike, the guy from the Redlands Aamco, (who by the way was incredibly kind and helpful during this situation) said the only reason this repaired transmission would go out so soon, would be due to shoddy parts, shoddy workmanship or both and that it should've been good for many miles and years to come.  He was shocked that the Gilbert location was not willing to do anything about it.  My son ended up leaving his car there as it would not have been worth the money to put in yet another transmission.  A total loss.  Mike was nice enough to rent him a car to get home.   This place is not practicing good business and is not a good place to trust with your car.  Run.

Rita is absolutely amazing!!  She saved us in a pinch, in a very short time-frame for my daughter's prom dress.  It seems as if she works through the night like a tireless little elf to get everything done and obviously takes great pride in her business.  Her prices are reasonable and her work is impeccable.  She has gained a lifetime client in me.  I love this woman!!

Really, really happy with this place!  The girl I had been using for years at another salon had moved away and then I spent months bouncing around from salon to salon trying to find a place I liked with a technician that would do as well.  I was about giving up hope when I was referred to Angel Touch Nails by Katie.  Both my sister and I have been going there for months now and have been very satisfied with all the services we have received as well as ALL THE TECHNICIANS that we have worked with.  Katie herself, is wonderful!  You can tell she really cares about her business and her customers and she obviously holds her staff to a high standard as they have all been great as well.  Can't say enough good about them. :)

I would give "0" stars if possible.  This company has caused me undue time and undue stress!!  After being a loyal customer for many years, we decided to change our cable and internet providers.  I cancelled our account in February, paid our final invoices and sent back all the equipment.  Last month, I received a new Statement stating that they had made an error and we had a credit on our account of $8 and change.  Ok, I didn't do anything with it figuring they would send me a check eventually.  Yesterday, I received a letter from a Collection Agency stating that we owed Century Link over $200!! WTH?  I called Century Link immediately and spent over an hour on hold being shuffled from representative to representative, as no one could figure out why on earth I was in collections as I did indeed have a credit on my account.  Each time they needed to transfer me to the next "higher" rep, they just dumped me back in the cue where I continued to wait on hold.  I finally got a hold of someone I thought would be helpful only to be informed that their systems went down and he was unable to do anything for me and could not call me back when it was fixed... nope.  They had me start the entire process over!!  I called first thing this morning and went straight to management where they confirmed   I absolutely have a credit and no one has any clue why this is in collections...  And they are guessing maybe someone on their end made an error... ya think!!!!!  They verbally said they would take care of it, but have no way to notify me with a confirmation.  Now I get to spend more time following up with both parties to make sure that everything gets resolved as it is obvious no one has a clue what they are doing and I need to babysit to ensure that they do what they have said they would do in order to protect my credit.  So unprofessional and a very poorly managed company.  In business, the only thing worse than bad customer service is incompetence, this company demonstrates both.  They will never see another dime from me.

My daughter had suggested we stop in here for dinner one night after her friends had told her it was "good pizza".  We ordered a pizza and some mozzarella sticks at the counter and had a seat.  After waiting a bit, we watched our mozzarella sticks get delivered to another table.  They quickly acknowledged their mistake but didn't bother to apologize.  Brought us another order fairly quickly... maybe too quickly as they weren't cooked all the way and were soggy and gross.  The pizza didn't fair much better.  I'm pretty sure everything is frozen not fresh. We left after only a few bites.  Not at all impressed and we won't be back.

Absolutely terrible service.  This place needs a lesson on organization and customer service.  My experience is similar to other reviews, but they have obviously been open for awhile now and you'd think they would have worked the bugs out by now.    While shopping at the outlets with my family we stopped for lunch in the food court and were happy to see there was at least 1 somewhat healthy option.  We waited in a very slow moving line for almost 10 minutes to place our order.  I ordered the chicken panini without avocado, the turkey BLT without avocado and a tuna wrap.  The girl taking our order seemed flustered and a bit rude.  She handed me our receipt but said nothing about how we would be alerted when our order was ready.  Do we just guess?  We waited almost 20 minutes for the order.  The people waiting were in a crowd to the side of the registers where another (older woman) kept asking if we were waiting for a salad.  I told her that we were just waiting for our order and she quickly replied that everything is made fresh so it takes awhile. (This could be remedied by having more than one lone person prepare the orders, no?)   Anyway, after a terribly long wait, we sat down to find that both the sandwiches had avocado, and my tuna salad wrap somehow became a chicken salad wrap with fruit and nuts in it! (Which I dislike!!). But, we had waited so long and were so aggravated we didn't even bother going up to complain...I didn't have another 20 minutes to stand there waiting!  So here I am making sure I YELP about it.  Spare yourself the agony...do not go here! ;)

Went to The Perch on a weekend lunch date with my husband. We sat on the rooftop lounge and were fully enjoying the perfect weather and atmosphere. I had the Salmon Salad which was exceptional and he had the chicken strips which he also said was good. The problem? THE SERVICE WAS PAINFUL!!  I asked for some sweetener when I ordered my iced tea... It took over 10 minutes and 2 more requests to get it. It took a long time to place our order and an even longer time to get it and it's a good thing we enjoyed our food because she did not check on us once. We both could've used refills on our drinks but I left feeling thirsty instead.  The bar could have made a few more bucks too as my husband would have had another beer had she bothered to check. Customer service can make or break an experience... Unfortunately it was the latter in this case.

I have ordered from this place on several occasions.  I can't comment on any other flavor other than the buffalo... We always order them extra crispy and they are delicious!!  The staff is always friendly.  The place is clean and the wings are made fresh while you wait.  Other than fries, my family hasn't tried anything else on the menu, but as far as wings go, they simply couldn't be better!

My review is similar to others I've read for this restaurant.  We went on a Saturday evening to celebrate a Girlfriends Birthday.  There were 12 of us and we didn't have a reservation, so we were happily surprised when they were able to seat us right away.  There was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar.  The waitress took our drink orders fairly quickly, but it took over an hour for her to take our dinner orders and I believe that only happened because one of us asked her to do so.  The food took a considerable amount of time considering there were only a few other people in there.  We were all pretty satisfied with our food.  The appetizers were tasty and my Husband especially loved the egg rolls (which were presented beautifully as well) and we were all pretty happy with our entrees.  Props to the chef!  Sadly however, the service was just awful.  My glass was dry on several occasions and it was difficult getting anyone's attention for a refill and once we were finished eating it took nearly another hour to get our bill.  I just don't understand why there was such a lack of service.  From start to finish over 3 hours had passed which I find unacceptable.  There are some positive changes made to this restaurant decor with the new ownership, I just don't see it lasting if they don't make some radical changes in the staff.  My advice... Keep the cook and fire everyone else!!

Love this place! The American Harvest salad is one of the tastiest salads I have ever eaten! It's chock-full of greens, butternut squash, beats, pecans, pepitas and chicken... Such a great combination of flavor and texture.  My friend is a big fan of the Curry Chicken salad sandwich which I think also looks delicious.. The food  is fresh, the portions are generous, the prices are fair and I love the vintage atmosphere! ... That's a winning combination to me!  I do hope they improve on the speed of service and/or delivery time to table. But the food is so good, it's worth the wait, so I will be patient while they work on that. I have been making this a weekly stop and wish them much success!
