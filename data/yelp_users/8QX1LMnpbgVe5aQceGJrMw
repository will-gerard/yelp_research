I was a little apprehensive about taking my dog here because no one else had reviewed and they were considerably cheaper than other hospitals for the surgery my dog required - while good for my wallet I was afraid that they would skip crucial steps. I was VERY pleasantly surprised by my experience!! My 5 month American bulldog had been in the emergency hospital all night because of a foreign body in his stomach and I was told he absolutely needed surgery. The animal hospital quoted me $2700, a price that I could not even begin to afford. I called around the next day, and when I called the Baseline animal clinic, I accidentally called the veterinarians cellphone! Instead of being angry, he let me explain the situation and informed me that while it was Friday and he was extremely busy, this was something that had to be taken care of and "if he didn't get a lunch that day, he didn't get a lunch." Immediately I felt like this was someone who cared! Then he told me that he wasn't even there yet and would call ahead and tell them I was coming in! When I brought Rommel in, he remembered talking to me from earlier and already knew the problem. He decided to xray before operating and wait it out. I had to leave and he kept Rommel x-raying him every 1/2 hour for 3 hours! They ended up not operating, and when I got my bill, he had only charged me $250 for something that should have been well over $700. Not only did he save my dog from being cut open, but he saved me thousands! I will never send anybody to anybody else! Dr. Finch and his staff gave me by far the best veterinary service that I or my puppy have ever had!

I stayed here with my fiances family over the weekend (again, as we have never before had a similar experience) and I am very disappointed to say that while out of my room briefly, someone came in to our room and stole many items such as my purse, and my clothes as well as my fiances. They also stole our car keys and have our home address which is only 20 min away. Security and the police were called. I am disappointed to hear that they won't do anything for us and don't want to file a claim because it would be a "waste of time." I am really disappointed because we have previously had a great experience here and now we will not be returning...I feel like everyone should know before bringing their family that there are some shady characters that hang out there and if they decide to single your family out you could be out all of your things with no resolution from the hotel.

My dog is being boarded here on Monday. I am an owner of a 5 month old american bulldog and have never left him yet! I was so nervous until I found this place!! They informed me that they had someone on the premises 24 hours and that my dog would never be in a kennel, even at night! I love the idea that I can trust that they will let me dog have fun while i'm gone, it makes a nervous pet owner like me feel better about leaving him!! I'm confident Rommel will have a blast!!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sadly Romeo passed away from a perforated bowel in December. I am so glad that he had a chance to have fun at places like this before it happened. The people here were so good to him and I felt so bad when I moved him away. I am upgrading it to 5 stars because not only did they take excellent care of my Romeo, but I couldn't find anywhere like it in California when I moved.

I lost Rommel but I now have a new dog that I take here since moving back to AZ. I still love Gilbert dogs and all they do for Dottie! I wish they would open a location closer to north Phoenix since it takes me 45 minutes each way.. But it's worth the drive because I can trust that my dog is well cared for!!

My boyfriend and I ate here on Friday night and we had a fantastic experience! We were greeted by friendly people at the front and then guided to our booth which was tiny but intimate. Our server was there right away to greet us and I have to say - it was the best service I have had .. Maybe ever. She was attentive but respectful that we were on a date so she wasn't by every few minutes .. She joked around with us and was knowledgable about the menu selections. I can't remember her name but I know she has a five month old son and her fianc√© works at bww - for any management reading this - she rocks! Our dinner was ok, we weren't thrilled with the duck but the ahi tuna was out of this world! By the time dessert rolled around we could not have had another bite we had had so much food. All in all we had a great night, great service, and the ambiance was perfect for Friday night date night. Oh and we had a groupon , but without it would have been $120 for two of us after tax and tip , not bad for what you get!

This is by far the best donut place I have ever been to! The donuts are fresh and hot and you can chose whatever you want to glaze or garnish them with. So far, I have tried the raspberry filled, maple glazed, cinnamon and sugar, and lemon glazed. Every one has been better than the next!

I haven't had my car detailed since I bought it a few years ago and after two dogs and many road trips my car was DIRTY!! I recently moved to Arizona and decided it was finally time to do something about it. I found Jon here on yelp! And decided to give him a try. I'm so glad I did! Jon was able to fit me in the same week and spent hours detailing my car. He came right to my house which was so convenient for me. After more time than I care to think about because my car was in such bad shape - my car looks better than when I first bought it!! I am so thankful for Jon, his service and his attention to detail! I can't recommend him enough!

Came in during my lunch hour because it was one of those days at work where I needed a little me time to get through the rest of the day! It was very nice, calming music and massage chair pedicure was exactly what I needed. Took a little longer than an hour which is really to be expected, and the lady helping me was very nice, and took attention to detail. $33 for a basic pedicure and french nails. I would definitely go again, maybe when I have more time to enjoy a deluxe pedi!
