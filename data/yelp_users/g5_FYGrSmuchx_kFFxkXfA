We had a flat tire at 6 o'clock at night. We pulled in and even though they were closing, they stayed late and changed our tire for us! These guys were so great!!

Dr is great but staff is awful. Unfriendly at the front desk to say the least. No one smiles and seems like they hate their jobs

The sweet and sour chicken was soggy.... I like it to be crunchy and the fried rice was tasted like cheap uncle bens! Not good... Sad because it's close... Iron chef is way better and more authentic!
