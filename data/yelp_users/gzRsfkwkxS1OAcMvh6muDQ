Other reviews are spot on.  The place looks rather sketchy, and I would not have even tried if not for the positive reviews.  I purchased the deluxe wash for $18 and it turned out to be a great deal.  Basically a full detail with wash/wax.   It took about 30 minutes (a bit longer than I would prefer), but I honestly did not mind because they were literally working on my car the entire time.  I will definitely go back.

I'll make this short but sweet.  LCP has awesome pizza, maybe the best thin crust around.  As good as Grimaldi's, maybe even better.  I just tried the Italian Beef with spicy peppers, and it was really really good.

After a run on the trail on 40th St trail, me and a buddy decided to stop by Bootleggers tonight to recharge with some food and beer.  This was our first time at the restaurant.  It has a pretty cool atmosphere and the staff was friendly,and initially attentive.   Everything seemed promising until 10 minutes passed before anybody took our drink order.  We waited an additional 10 to 15 minutes to order food and then a excessive amount of time for the food to arrive.  I'm not an impatient person when it comes of food service and can also understand long waits if the restaurant is slammed.  Bootleggers was not overly busy and we spotted our waitress talking casually with other staff or doing nothing at all.   She made no attempt to ask for drink refills or provide an apology for the long wait.  Fortunately the wings and nachos we ordered we outstanding, and the beer selection is good.  I wish I could give 4 or 5 stars, but the poor service makes that impossible.  I will give it another chance though.

This place falls in line with the growing trend of made to order and personalized individual entrees. It's the chipotle or subway of pizza restaurants.  Overall, much better than expected and I'd put it up there with any of the better pizza by the slice places around town.  The crust is very thin and crisp, and the ingredients taste fresh.  The red sauce had a nice taste, but did not overpower the pizza.
