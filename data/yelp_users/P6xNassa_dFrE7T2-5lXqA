When I pulled up to this place, I broke my first rule of dining:  Never eat at a place with more wait staff than tables with customers.   I found the food to be between 3.5 to 4.5 stars, depending on the dish, enough points to earn my revisit. However, the customer service was below 1 star. I read similar reviews stating the food is great but the service sucks, which couldn't be more true. My interaction was with one waitress in particular who forgot our drink order, then forgot our food order, then forgot to bring us chips and water (4 times she mentioned she would get the chips before they actually arrived).   For food, I recommend the carne asada tacos which were delicious. I would pass on the nachos or anything that requires chips to eat since they are not freshly prepared.   For service, I recommend not coming at all. Maybe.. Maybe get it to go if it is offered. But I can't stress enough how bad the service is to warrant a 1 star review    Thank you for reading.

What to drink: the iced toddy -- it's one of the best I've ever had  What to eat: the breakfast sandwich, it's completely customizable but I got a biscuit with bacon, Gruyere cheese, avocado and an over medium egg.The biscuit is what sets it a part from over breakfast sandwiches I've had, probably because they specialize in their pastries.  I only stopped by for a bit on my way to work, but they have an awesome playlist and some nice seating (inside and outside). If you're looking for an escape from some of the overcrowded coffee shops like Giant Coffee or Lux, I would definitely try working out of Ollie Vaugh's.
