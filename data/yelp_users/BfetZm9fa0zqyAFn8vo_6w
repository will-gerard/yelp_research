Doesn't get any better than this place. Seriously, I was the nightmare customer. I cancelled last minute TWICE, I showed up an hour late to my appointment, and I had a groupon, and honestly I wasn't expecting much...you know what i got...the works. Seriously for my cheap Yaris auto tinting they treated me like Kim Kardashian walked in to get her Beemer  hooked up. They were fast, professional, and friendly. My only complaint is I only get to go there once. Oh and they also have a great guarantee. Thanks Stewart!!

5 stars for the service and 5 stars for Mike! If you are like me, just the word "insurance" hurts your ears. I don't want to talk about it or think about it, I just want it to magically be there to take care of me and not cost an arm and a leg...and that is why I am so happy I found Mike.  Mike will take care of you. He helped me understand all the really boring details, he explained exactly what types of coverage worked best for me for both my home and my vehicle. It was really painless, very personalized and amazingly affordable. Plus, Mike is a really awesome guy, still a little confused on why he would work in insurance, but I am really glad he does.

Talk about authentic, this is a place I would be excited to take a Vietnamese foreign exchange student, not because I want to impress them, but so they can translate the menu and get the waiter to bring me another $2.50 beer.  I will say, I was a little disappointed that there were no vegetarian pho options, but I don't think authentic pho is vegetarian, so until I learn to say "can I get this without beef" in Vietnamese, I don't deserve it. I will stick with the few veggie options provided, which are delicious, ridiculously cheap, and easily enough for two meals.

Living at Scottsdale Springs is like being in an abusive relationship, and when you break up, finding out they gave you an STD.  Moving in, everyone says the same thing... "It won't happen to me". It will, and the only thing I can say is PROTECT YOURSELF, because Scottsdale Springs will attract you with their low move in costs, inexpensive rent, and great location, and then, once you're committed, they will screw you. They will move a family of 5 Acrobats in to a one bedroom apartment above you, they will tell you there in no "transfer fee" to move apartments, but then when moving day comes and your packed and loading the truck, they will tell you there is a $200 deposit on the new apartment, and a $100 admin fee. Oh, and just an FYI, all the cop cars in the parking lot...that is not on-site security.    So if after reading this you are still the type to fall for the "bad boy," go for it, but remember, when you go in the office, get EVERYTHING in writing, keep your lease paperwork, and please please please, schedule a walk through before you move out, and TAKE PICTURES! Welcome Home

Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I don't have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for "sampling" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!

Bikram yoga is practiced in a 100+ degree room and the point is to sweat. Kudos to this studio for keeping the smell of a bunch of sweating people tolerable. I can't say all the studios I have practiced in have been as successful. I am also thrilled they have 4 early morning classes. I hope this schedule continues.

I love this bar, everyone needs a place they can go in their pajamas and get a jager bomb at 10:00 in the morning with no judgment. Not saying I do that, I am just saying it's nice to have the option.

This review ultimately means nothing since Einstein's has a million locations and probably makes like a buyillion dollars, but I have to say it, because I don't understand why...I find both their bagels & their cream cheese way too "fluffy"! Both feel like they have been overly injected with air, I could eat like 20 of them and still be starving, a bowl of rice crispies gives me more satisfaction.

Keep your expectations low and you can't go wrong with this pub. Don't be put off by the slightly greasy menu with a few items crossed out with sharpie. There are plenty of delicious bar food dishes to choose from. Ignore the fact that the server is wearing an over-sized tank top and her hair looks a bit dirty. She is extremely friendly and will take good care of you. There is live music, and sure, he might be drunk, but he will have you singing along to his version of Tom Petty in no time. And if that isn't enough entertainment for you, they have darts, plenty of TVs, and a pool table, plus, just people watching can keep you laughing and ordering another round for hours.

Best Spinach/Artichoke dip EVER! and when I have company in town this place is a great choice. My family & friends are always super impressed with the food and the beer. The college crowd and the limited parking is a bit annoying, but again, that dip with a pint of Kilt Lifter makes it worth it.

Don't be fooled by the name, or that everything on the menu is vegan, this is not the place for anyone on a diet or "watching what they eat". The food is delicious comfort food with lots of fried things, in large portions, and I love it! Sure there are some things like salads, and rice bowls, if you need to go the healthier route, but no matter what you should be washing it all down with a creamy sinful Soynami. As soon as Green gets their liquor license it will be a 5 star rating for sure.

It would be very hard for me to give any Bikram Studio a bad review, because no matter what, if it is a place you can go and practice, it's good. But I will say this one is a bit different then what I am use to. It's pretty big and well lite, and there is a stage in the front where the instructor stands and they use a microphone to guide the practice. Which again, is all fine, just different, and every class I have attended was still wonderful, and I left sweaty and peaceful....the only drawback is, you never get a foot massage during the back strengthening series, which is understandable in a class of 50+ people.

I was pleasantly surprised, they had very fresh salsa, just wish it was spicier, and my meal was delicious. The service was great and the prices were reasonable.

I think when it comes to wine everyone has very different expectations. So for me, someone who knows almost nothing about wine, and really has no desire to, but knows she really likes to drink it and will never be able to tell the difference between a $20 bottle and a $200 bottle, AZ Wine's selection is a bit too high class for me. BUT! Their wine tasting events on Thursdays, now there is a reason to keep me at least present in the wine world. The wine tastings are perfect, they walk around, give you a little sample, give you a little info on the wine & the maker and then they go away and just let you enjoy. No one watching me to see if I'm swirling it correctly, or if I am sniffing it, or if am making a face and saying "oh wow I get a really nutty oak cherry after taste" just me and my wine and some knowledge that I will not remember the next day.

This review is totally skewed! So after reading this DO NOT sell your car, move closer to a bus stop, or buy a year long bus pass!    I am one of the very lucky few who lives 2 minutes walk to a bus stop, has one connection that arrives 3 minutes after my first bus drops me off, and then gets dropped off directly in front of my work. I also travel through Scottsdale & Tempe, so my fellow commuters are mainly business/student types. And the bus is on average about 1/2 full. It's pretty perfect.   BUT...when I tell other people I take the bus, their face squishes all up like they just sucked on a lemon and they just can't believe that I take the bus willingly.   Here are the reasons that I am assuming 99% of the people I talk to have negative associations with the bus.  -On the majority, the scheduling is HORRIBLE. Buses on major routes might run 15 minutes, but others only run ever 30 or even worse every hour. So if you have to make a connection, you might have a bit of a wait, which can make a trip to a destination 5 miles away an hour ordeal. That would suck  -Buses only have capacity to store 2 bikes. Since bus stops are mainly only on major roads if you live in a big neighborhood, or in a less developed area, most would ride a bike to the bus stop. Well, if the bus pulls up and there are already 2 bikes in the bike rack, what are you suppose to do? Ditch your bike? yeah, I'm guessing that isn't an option, looks like you are waiting for the next bus & hoping it's bike rack isn't full...and I really hope this isn't one of the buses that only runs ever hour, and its the middle of July!    -Your bus route is a popular one. It's great for the environment when lots of people ride the bus, but not so great when you are stuck standing, squished between 6 people, you have no idea where everyone's hands are, AND, we all live in Arizona, not everyone is going to smell of roses.  So for those reasons, I totally understand the lemon face, but not to rub it in, I haven't had that experience yet (knock on wood)

I think all reviews of this place should be time stamped!   11:45 a.m. since it was my lunch hour  I tried to get there a little early and avoid the "lunch rush", which, turns out there wasn't one, and now I know why. Service was ridiculously slow and the food was ridiculously mediocre.   It's too bad I wasn't there at 11:45 p.m. instead, because they do have a really impressive beer selection, which I am guessing is fueling 100% of the good reviews, because food and service really don't matter as much after a couple good beers.   an extra star awarded for color coordinating the menu so all Vegetarian items are Green. I did like that a lot.

I almost feel like I am cheating, but as someone who has been going to YC's for 15 years, and has done her best to stay true to them as their veggies got limp, the floors got dirty, and the staff got sweatier, I just can't do it anymore, not with this hot new Mongolian Grill around the corner. This place takes it to a whole new level, and its so clean, and so many options, nothing can compete...then you throw a $2 pint happy hour special in there and yeah, sorry YCs...can we still be friends?

This place makes me want to order the largest size, eat all of it, lick the cup, spoon, napkin, my fingers, the counter, anyone else in the store who is also indulging and then make out with the owner for creating such delicious cold creamy decadence that not only I can enjoy but also my vegan sister. Added bonus: cute clean restroom

The menu is a vegetarian's nightmare. You are pretty much stuck with either nachos (does not include beans) or a veggie burger (obvious microwaved boca burger). They do have shuffle board, but you have to pay, and its timed, so make sure you pee prior to dropping in your quarters because you got maybe 15 minutes to bust that game out or your screwed.

The best word to sum up my experience would be "IMPRESSED". Upon walking in, the decor is beautiful, I love the authentic looking place settings, and the lighting  just gave an all around warm feel to this small space. And even though the restaurant is very small I didn't feel like they had the tables packed in there, so we were all sitting on top of one another or stuck listening to anyone's conversation. Our server was very nice and informative, and was really helpful when selecting the perfect variety of dishes. When our food arrived it was amazingly flavorful and portion size was more than enough for leftovers. Which were just as delicious the next day.

This place is only awesome if you are one of three things: 1. an Ohio State fan, 2. a metrosexual, or 3. someone trying to hook up with an Ohio State fan or metrosexual...Everyone else, do yourself a favor and go to any one of the many hundreds of awesome bars in old town that will happily accommodate the general public.

When I first saw their hours of operation I thought it was a mistake and they meant to write p.m., instead of a.m., but now that I have eaten there twice it makes more sense. When nothing else is open, and you're wasted, I'm sure this place ROCKS!

Ok, I know, during the hiring process I am sure there is a very limited number of doctors, engineers, or rocket scientists applying, but seriously, do I need to draw you a diagram of what a sandwich with no meat and no onions looks like cause it shouldn't be that hard.

I don't know if I would say Lao Thai is a great Thai restaurant, but i would definitely say Lao Thai is a great restaurant that happens to serve Thai food. The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is fast and friendly, and the past 2 times I was there they were rockin some pretty awesome 80's jams. They have an impressive menu, with plenty of vegetarian options and I thoroughly enjoyed my red curry, even though it wasn't very spicy.

I don't like sweets for breakfast, no pancakes, no french toast, no cinnamon rolls. All the sugar just makes me feel sick the rest of the day.  Then I met the Bosa buttermilk bar. For a breakfast made of those bad boys sign me up for a day of two root canals, pass a kidney stone, and give birth to triplets. It'll be worth it!

I got 3 strikes at Verde, hence...I'm out! Strike 1: Not very vegetarian friendly. Strike 2: They have all the necessary items to make nachos, but when asked if they would make me nachos I got a very quick and blunt "NO". Strike 3: When forced to order a meat dish and request they not include the meat (the most EXPENSIVE ingredient) not only did they make no attempt to substitute the meat with maybe beans, or guac, or extra cheese, they still charged full price! I don't want to eat meat and I sure don't want to pay for it.   And as far as the food, well, they got that part right, for a place that serves fine fast food, when you ask me how my meal was, my response would be "Fine".

I had been shopping for a kitchen table for 6 months and was soooo over being swarmed by sales people as soon as I walked through the door, and then unable to ditch them I was thrown endless sales pitches if I even glanced at a table. So when I walked in to Mod Home and was greeted by a person, far off in the distance, just to say hello and to let to let me know if I had questions to let them know I was seriously relieved. I was instantly in a better mood. I was relaxed. I took my time. I looked at other items that I wasn't even in the market for just because they have some really cool furniture to look at. And when I finally did have a question I was able to quickly locate a person to help. I ended up buying an awesome kitchen table at a great price. The delivery guys were great and the assembly was quick.

I can't believe I have been fooled by all of those horrible commercials "2 pair of lens plus the eye exam for $59.99!" for so many years. I didn't understand what a true optometrist could be until now. Dr. Biglaiser is totally old school, he has been practicing for 50 years, FIFTY YEARS! and he knows what he is doing, PLUS, extra bonus he has frame inventory starting from way back when he first started practicing. So if you are looking for true authentic 50's, 60's, 70's, glasses you should stop by, I had a blast just trying all them on.
