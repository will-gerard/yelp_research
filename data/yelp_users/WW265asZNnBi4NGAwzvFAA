After hearing about this place for months, I just HAD to go try it out. It was a Thursday night and surprisingly really busy. After walking in and not seeing anyone seating, we sat ourselves. The ONE hostess on duty then scolded us for doing so. Then after being confused, within 15 minutes three diff servers approached our table. One with water, one for a drink order and one to take our order. None of them smiled or seemed to care to wait on us, probably bc we weren't drinking wine. If it wasn't for the remarkable bruschetta and proscuttio sandwich, I would have left. The food is incredible and I would go back for takeout but the service really sucked.

FAVORITE restaurant EVER! Lovve the cheesecake flavors and everything I've ever had. I don't feel like this place needs to be reviewed but I had the most amazing meal this weekend and had to rave about it! Delish! Enough said.

In search of the perfect deli? Here it is!! I always get the maple honey turkey full sub with the works: lettuce, tomato, mayo and onion. It's $8 for that, some chips and a pickle. They slice the meat right in front of you it's so fresh! I love it. If you have any room left, go for the cannoli.

This place is PHENOMENAL!!! My boyfriend and I did a staycation for his birthday and bc of that, they upgraded us to a suite to celebrate!! The staff was so helpful and friendly. We were given passes for the BBQ dinner and drink tickets the night we arrived. The room was gorgeous. The view of the pool was beautiful. The bed was so soft and comfortable. It was perfect. The only complaint I have is the bartender, I've been in the service industry and she was not nice or accommodating. I'd think for such a lavish resort they would have someone personable and chatty, she was rude. Everything else was great. The free breakfast was delicious and they carry Starbucks coffee!! The pool is a little small but still pretty and nice to relax at. We will definiately be back!!

My boyfriend kept telling me about this place he had been to a few years ago with a really cool beer flight. Well, the drinks were about the only good thing about this experience. We were sat pretty quick but took 10 min to be greeted. It took another 10 to get the drinks and order. When the food came out, our server was nowhere to be found. All of the few times she came to the table she was pretty friendly and personable. We wanted water and extra sides of sauce and had to stop other people to ask for it. Our food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good enough to want to go back. Our server never once checked on us during our entr√©e. When she finally did come back, we asked for a box bc we wanted to go, another 15 min to get that. I found a manager on the way to the bathroom and told him I was not impressed and probably would not be back. The worst part: he knew who our server was! Before I could even say her name. That. is. awful. If someone messes up that often, she should no longer work there or fill a hostess position.  The manager did take care of our bill, which was extremely nice. But I can't imagine they'll be in business for long if he has to do that for all her tables.

If I could, I would give a 6th star!! I've been meaning to try this place for months and finally went! The waitress was veryy helpful in my decisions to choose the top 3 items on the menu. The french toast (for sure!), huevos rancheros and the biscuits and gravy. It was everything I hoped for and more and if you're a breakfast person like I am then you'll love it too!

A group of came here and the food was amazing. The server was awesome and patient with us, because when the six of us go out, we take a long time and order a lot. Every kind of pancake we shared was delicious, as well as the eggs, bacon, sausage and sandwiches. Great place for a quick brunch/lunch or get together with a location that can't be beat.

TRENDY, PRICEY AND YUMMY are the words that come to mind after my first experience here. I've tried the majority of the sushi places around and I can see why this place gets such good reviews. The prices are a little steep and most rolls are between $9-12. (So go here on a date ;) Get there early because they fill up fast for happy hour. If you want something different, try the Scottsdale or Cougar rolls! Very good!

For being in the heart of old town, surrounded by so many good places, my expectations were high for this place. I was very let down. I ordered takeout and to my surprise, it was nothing special. The burrito was huge and tasty but there are so many phenonmenal Mexican places I don't think I'll be back. The gorgeous bar looked good for happy hour drinks and shots though =)

OMG YUM! My friends and I are on a mission to find some of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix and this one is phenomenal! Where else can you order an omelet with hasbrowns and get a side of pancakes too, for like $10?! I have been back 3x and love trying new things every time. The salmon omelet as well as the spicy chorizo omelet are great, the stuffed friench toast and berry pancakes are amazing and the fresh squeezed orange juice is a must for first time diners! The decor is cheesy but who cares when the food is so good?! Top breakfast place for sure.

I forgot to write a review when I got my haircut last year at this place. Needless to say, from my star rating, I will never be back. HORRIBLE! I had gotten a coupon from work, thinking it would be a great deal. One of the older stylists, I forget her name, took forever to do the cut. I had to request to have it styled. And when I left, my hair was cut unevenly!! I don't typically check to see if my sides are even but this time I did. And not only was one side longer than the other but I had to then pay more money the next week to fix it!! When I called back a few weeks later to redeem the other services on my coupon (massage and manicure), there was never any answer at the front desk. Although the message says they'll call you back, they NEVER DID! This place was unprofessional and a joke. I hope since then something has changed but I doubt it.

Co-workers introduced me to this amazing place last summer and now I bring all my family and friends here every chance I get!! Everything is absolutely delicious, from the cookies to lemon squares to turkey sandwiches to the BEST grilled cheese on the planet. Good prices and the staff is always friendly so I would recommend Chloes for a quick lunch or early dinner =)

When I first moved to Arizona, I wanted to try new establishments I couldn't find back east. My friend who lives in South Scottsdale brought me here, and I'm italian, so I was excited. For being named "Sauce" its sauce wasn't too great. I ordered the caesar and spaghetti and meatballs. It was OK but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't recommend it, and I havent been back, but for italian and good sauces, I would prob go somewhere else.

Let me list the things I've tried at this place: Waffle dogs, the regular AND pecan caramel french toast, the salmon omelet with cream cheese, the Selena omlet wrap and sausage links. The Wolf Pack is one of its staples, with layered eggs, bacon cheese AND hasbrowns...so good!! Everything is amazing and you woud never guess it because of its location in its tiny nook. The service is very friendly and I didn't wait long for any of the food. Great breakfast choice if you live farther south =)

I LOVE this place! This was one of my first foodie finds when I moved to Phoenix. It was everything review sites described and more. The bakery has an endless array of treats, all delicious. The sandwiches are huge and worth every bite. They offer 20 different kinds of cream cheese! I'm a huge food lover and I love this place. I bring all my guests to eat here and it never disappoints.

My friends told me about this place, but I had to see it for myself. The campfire smores ice cream sundae was so perfectly made. I replaced the chocolate ice cream with peanut butter, and then it had hot fudge, marshmellow sauce, whipped cream and a toasted marshmellow block on top. They toast it in front of you! I could barely wait til I got home to eat it! Needless to say, every drop was delectable and it may be better than coldstone.

For a chain restaurant, this one is pretty good. I've had a bunch of items on their menu and are never disappointed. For the friendly service, great food and location, I will gladly spend a few more bucks for a fabulous dining experience. For date night or just a night out, go here!

I've gotten my hair cut twice at this salon using Groupon certificates. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They ask you what you exactly what you want and cut and style your hair the way you tell them to. For $12 coupons the haircut was decent but most of the staff seems a bit older and out of the trend loop. The location is convenient right by the 17 but if you don't live out west it may not be worth the drive.

A few of my friends asked me to tag along to Kona's happy hour and I'm so glad I did. They have margaritas and cosmos for $5 and the Philly roll is included on the list (when it never is). I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fabulous happy hour.

I'm usually not one to drive 35 minutes for brunch, or even to Tempe at all, but this place was well worth it. BEST french toast I've ever had. My friends also got the biscuits and gravy, crepes and eggs. The benedict sauce wasn't my favorite. Our server was nice, ditzy but nice, but the food came out fast and everything was amazing. I will definitely be back.

To be able to sit in a big comfy chair, eat some good food and drink a beer while in a movie theater is an absolutely wonderful idea. I would highly recommend for everyone to try this even once. The price is steep at $18 a ticket but it's well worth a great experience.

I LOVE this place!! One of the best massages I've EVER had! I found this place on WeeklyPlus for $30 for an hour. The owner, Megan, also runs deals all the time, like TWO hour massages for $29!!! Beat that! and Shes the BEST. She's so friendly and is so good at what she does. She's flexible with times, prices and located right in the heart of Old Town. If you want a relaxing, fabulous massage that won't rob your wallet..you've found it.

I can see why this sushi bar constantly makes the top 3 places to get amazing sushi. They have a great happy hour with options that you can't find anywhere else. The spicy tuna crunch is so good. The drinks/martinis are delicious too.  I've been there three times and once on a date. All of the sushi was incredible and the filet my boyfriend got was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. I always love a server who doesn't make a face at all the questions I ask and each time the ladies were awesome. Perfect for any occasion, happy hour or not, I love this place.

This place is adorable! And perfect for meeting friends for breakfast (which I do often). The food smelled and tasted delicious. The server had no trouble exchanging my coffee for a latte, which is a nice change in Old Town. The restaurant has a fresh, comfy feel and everyone is friendly right when you walk in the door. I will be going back for sure to try more on the menu and sit on the patio!

Hands down, the best massage of my life!! And I've had over 20 massages from many other places. Liz is by far the best. I was skeptical of all the rave reviews on here but it rings true, she's amazing. I left feeling so relaxed and pampered. It's quite a drive down to Tempe but well worth it! She has deals all the time, like $40 for 90 minutes, I'm going back next month!!

LOVE THIS PLACE! The food and drinks never disappoint. The mac n cheese app or fondue are amazing! I've also had the fish tacos, a few of the sandwiches and salads. The atmosphere is fun and casual and it's usually very packed. I always bring my friends and out of town guests here bc I enjoy this place so much. It's a must try.
