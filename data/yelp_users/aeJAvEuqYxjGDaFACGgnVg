This place is horrible, we pay 30 dollars a month for 2 years with our dog not needing anything, then when we have an emergency and our dog has blood coming from his butt we called 3 different Banfield animal HOSPITAL and not one of them can help us with our dog because we don't have an appointment. Give me a f#@*ing break.  Didn't know I needed an appointment for a hospital. Why do I pay you guys money again? Is it for the shots that I can pick up at a feed store for 7 bucks a piece?  I will no longer continue to pay this so called "animal hospital" money for doing nothing for my dog when he needs help.  They seem to care more about getting there money than they care about animals. I should of gave him his shots myself and saved the 30 bucks a month so I could afford to take him to a REAL animal hospital when he needs help!

The pizza is absolutely amazing here, so many fresh ingredients and options to choose from I can literally get a new style of pizza every day.  The decor is beautiful,  you can hang out for hours and feel comfortable doing so.  The staff is super friendly and very helpful.   They also have a beautiful inside/outside bar with a delicious drink menu, local brews on draft and yes even wine on tap, which I love. Great prices for the high quality food that your getting.   I will definitely be back to this restaurant
