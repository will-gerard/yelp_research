Dr. Hamberlin and his staff are awesome.  I had to have my first root canal today and I was having a lot of anxiety about it.  I have always heard the horror stories about root canals and I have to say my experience was painless... he is amazing!    In my experience, most dentists will come in, look at the x-ray, roll up their sleeves and get to work with very little explanation.  Dr. Hamberlin is quite the opposite.  He sat with me and explained exactly what he needed to do, including drawing on my x-ray to illustrate the specifics of the procedure.  He put me totally at ease.  Once he started the procedure other than some minor expected twinges it was easy. As he put it "like having a cavity filled".   During the procedure he continues to explain different steps he is taking and lets you know how much time is remaining.  If I ever need any other oral surgery in the future he is the only doctor I will see.  I highly recommend him.

This place is great. The Sushi is always so fresh and they don't skimp on the amount of fish in each roll.  The restaurant has good energy, a must visit for any Sushi lover.

Really enjoy seeing shows here. The acoustics are great, the Phoenix Symphony is filled with such talent.  It is easy to get to by light rail, dropping you right on the corner with a very short walk to Symphony Hall.  There are lots of places to dine nearby before and after the show. Concessions at Symphony Hall are reasonable as well, you can bring your own water.

Without a doubt the worst dining experience I have ever had. I ordered a wedge salad. The salad had all the makings of a wedge salad, but was not. With loads of dressing saturating the whole plate with lettuce in small pieces it was disguising.  The menu is so small you really did not have any healthy choices.  I asked if I could add a protein to the salad and was told they only have fried chicken, ok forget that.  We ended up just leaving and going to another restaurant nearby.

Bevvy is a great hang place. A bar atmosphere with healthy fare on the menu that was not just an after thought, like most bars.   We ordered a salad and it was so fresh and loaded with ingredients. I usually don't prefer field greens because many times they come out wilted, but these tasted fresh picked. The bacon popcorn is a great starter and the hummus was tasty.  The place was packed,  and the service was great.  Lauren, the Owner, was so nice and accommodating. I am hoping they open one in South Tempe soon. A great place after the gym!!

This place is awesome.  Every dish had excellent flavor.   The shrimp tacos are a must have.  The street corn was very good and the horchata was yummy. I encourage anyone looking for authentic Mexican to visit Presidio.
