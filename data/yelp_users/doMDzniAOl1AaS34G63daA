I like this place. I take my car in, they fix it quickly and honestly, and they charge a fair price. What's not to like about a mechanic you can trust?

I don't like getting my hair cut. I don't like just sitting there while someone fidgets around my head. I have to fight the urge to look at my watch every few minutes when I'm in the chair.  On the other hand, my curly hair goes crazy when it gets too long. Life is about tradeoffs.  The other part about haircuts I don't like is the upselling. I know it's part of their job. I accept their capitalist drive to maximize profits. But no matter how I answer, "so what kind of shampoo do you use?" they look at me like I've said "bat urine". (For the record: Pantene shampoo and conditioner. See? Not bat urine.)  Gentleman Joe's doesn't do that. They don't seem to sell any haircare products, unless you count combs. So really they don't care how I take care of my hair. They care about making it shorter and better-looking.   And they do that very well. I always get compliments on my haircuts. Maybe that's just because I no longer look like the Unabomber, but I'm still giving the guys at Gentleman Joe's the credit.  After the haircut you get a scalp-and-shoulder rub with one of those vibrating-hand things. It's not a massage, but it's a nice touch.  Guys, if you're looking for a good haircut at a good price, I recommend Gentleman Joe's.

So far I'm not happy. I dropped off a coat to be cleaned and have a button sewed on. It was supposed to be ready Friday evening. But when I came to pick it up, my coat was the only item not ready. No apologies, not even a courtesy call to let me know? Disappointing.

I love Nello's.   I'd like to write something prettier, something poetic. It's one of my favorite pizza places, and it deserves a little wordsmithery. But I'm too sated on deep-dish deliciousness to muster up my usual silver-tongued sweetness.  If you like Chicago-style pizza (and I do) made fresh with quality ingredients in generous portions, try Nello's.  Their Hawaiian pizza is excellent. Any of their pizzas are, really.   Or you could smear some tomato paste and plasticky cheese on a piece of charred cardboard and call it "pizza". It works for Domino's, after all.

The food is pretty good, but the service not so much. I placed a takeout order online, arrived to pick it up as scheduled, paid for it, and stood there waiting 10 minutes with 4 or 5 other people - while the people behind the counter didn't even bother to look for my order, which (as it turns out) was sitting right there on the shelf in plain sight. Wtf?

So I'm going to preface this by stating the probably obvious: I'm not a vegan. I'm much closer to the carnivore end of the spectrum. I like meat, and things you eat with meat, and occasionally vegetables. I accepted an invite to meet someone here with a certain amount of anxiety.  But hey, I'm not new to the Interwebs. So I did a little homework. I looked at the menu and found some items that sounded okay. And I read my friend sunny b's reviews here, because she knows this stuff. This made me a little less nervous.  Carnivores, take it from me: no need to worry. This place ROCKS. The buffalo wings are plenty spicy - I liked them better than any actual chicken wings I've ever had. The samosas were wonderful: a nice flaky crust, and the filling was very savory with an excellent texture. I had the Mongolian bowl with not-beef, which was delicious: good noodles, fresh vegetables, and the only way I knew the not-beef wasn't beef was the texture. The portions were great and the staff was friendly.  For dessert, I got an oatmeal pie: two oatmeal cookies with a creme filling between. DELICIOUS!   I definitely recommend this place, and I will certainly eat there again when I'm in the area.

I'm a carnivore. If my doctor told me to go vegetarian or risk death, I'd probably have to think about it a while.   So Fogo E Brasa (now The Brazilian Bull) has been on my "to try" list for a while now. It's not far from home, and I'd heard good things. Finally a friend and I made plans to meet there for lunch last week.  First piece of advice: do NOT forget the cylinder. Each table has a little cylinder painted green, yellow, and red. Green end up means "keep it comin'". Red end up means, "whoa there, I'm drowning in meats". And when you're finally sated, you lay the cylinder on its side to say "uncle".  You may think, "I'm never gonna need the red. I'm a big-time carnivore who rips bears in half on weekends." That's crazy talk. They will keep bringing you meat on swords every couple of minutes as long as the green is showing. Don't be afraid to use the red - no one will think less of you. (Also it keeps the waiter from asking, "What's the matter, don't you like it?" when he shows up with another sword and your plate is full from the last three.)  The food is very good. I liked the fried bananas dipped in cinnamon and sugar. The chicken was a little dry, but the ham was very moist. And the tri-tip and prime rib were both great: moist, savory, and cooked to perfection. I'd also recommend the caiprinhas for those who like a drink with dinner.  The service is also very good - attentive without being obtrusive. My water glass never neared empty.   The decor is pretty nondescript. It's a pretty generic-looking restaurant - nice, but unmemorable. I'd have enjoyed a little more Brazil in my Brazilian Bull.   Check it out if you're in the neighborhood. And Respect the Cylinder.

I think a great weekend starts with a great breakfast., ideally including a mimosa.  And I've not found a better place to have breakfast than Morning Glory Cafe.  The atmosphere is wonderful. It's quiet, laid-back, and beautiful. Morning Glory is set on a farm property near South Mountain. I found it easy to forget that I was still in the middle of a major metropolitan area.  And the food is excellent. I had French toast with apple butter and pecans. The thick slices of country bread were soft but never got soggy with syrup. I also had some locally made sausage, which had a delightful hint of spice that really offset the sweetness of the rest of the meal.  I would definitely recommend this place, especially on a nice spring or autumn morning.

Sometimes you're just in the mood for a cheesesteak. It's not healthy. You know it's not healthy. But a well-made Philly cheesesteak is a thing of beauty. And when it hits the spot, that spot stays hit.   Forefathers makes the best ones I've had. I like Capriotti's, but Forefathers is the reigning champ for me. Lots of meat, thick slices of mushroom, plenty of Cheez Whiz, and soft, delicious bread. Good fries, too!  If you go for lunch, go early or call ahead. The place has a long line, which is generally a good sign.

SO love this place. I used to visit their location in Tempe from time to time, but now I'm a bit south of there and decided to try another location. And you know what? Still just as fantastic.

When I first saw Hillside Spot, I thought it was a new coffee place. I guess I was a little predisposed to think so (there used to be a Coffee Plantation there). I was happy. I could use a non-Starbucks coffee place in my neighborhood.  Turns out destiny had something even better in mind.  I had lunch at Hillside this very afternoon. After pondering the options (not many), I decided on the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with their own special coleslaw - not on the side, but on the sandwich.  I don't like coleslaw. I do not like it on a plane. I will not eat it on a train. I would not touch it in rural Spain. Coleslaw is not my thing in the sense that burning off my own eyebrows is"not my thing".  But somehow the cashier talked me into trying it. And I am SO glad I did, because the sandwich was excellent. I washed it down with a bottle of Mexican Coke (the good stuff) and considered it an excellent lunch. I may just have to rethink my stance on coleslaw.  The restaurant is clean, well-lit, and just about perfect for a weekend breakfast or lunch. The tables aren't too crowded or too far apart, and it has a nice contemporary feel. I am definitely going back.

You know, it seems almost silly to review a single fast food place. But what the heck - life is short, the time is now, and there's nothing to lose but patience.  I'm torn on this place, which happens to be across the street from my office. The management seems very nice and friendly, and committed to good service. On the other hand, they seem to have some kind of climate control issue every time I come in. In the summer the food cooks itself, and in the winter you find yourself clinging to your icy beverage for warmth.  Foodwise, it's a Jack in the Box. Not much more need be said.

Oh my, yes. I've been craving some good barbecue lately, and this hit the spot. I had the moist brisket and the pork loin with the original sauce and a big ol' ear of sweet buttery corn. The meat was moist and flavorful, the sauce was a great blend of sweet and hot. Will definitely be back.

Custom donuts.  Let that sink in for a minute - let the possibilities wash over you like a warm, sugary glaze. Let the thought permeate the moist, spongy cake of your being.   A friend told me about this place, and I was immediately excited about the idea. Don't get me wrong, I still love Krispy Kreme, but after a while the same variations on sugar, chocolate, maple, and fruit-filled wear thin. And Bosa is good, too, but the idea of getting your very own custom-made fresh donut sounded amazing.  I dropped by on a Saturday afternoon after watching "Mad Max: Fury Road" (which was terrific, btw). There weren't a lot of customers in the store, which was perfect for me. I looked over the little menu sheet, and since it was my first time I stuck to the popular options on the front. A few minutes later they handed me a box of hot, fresh donuts and I rushed home to devour them.  They were SO good. The Black Forest (cherry glaze with chocolate chips sprinkled on top) was just wonderful - soft, melty, chocolatey goodness. And the others were all terrific, too. I actually missed them a little when I finished off my half-dozen the next day.   Move over, Krispy Kreme, there's a new top dog in town.
