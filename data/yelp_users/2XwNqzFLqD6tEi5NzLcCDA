Ordered the white pizza, half of which had sausage & feta. It was great. Very well done for delivery pizza. Also ordered a Greek salad which had tons of feta (which I love) and it's wasn't bad, but decent. I would certainly order from them again, while a little pricey, the pizza is done well.

I got the blue cheese peppercorn with chipotle mayo and an egg, cooked medium. Lemme tell y'all: damn, damn, damn. So damn good. The burger was excellently seasoned. & I mean excellent. It came with fries & chose the Cajun steak fries - again phenomenal & seasoned really well. A+ for the food.  Come get a burger here!

Tegan is a great American & an even better bartender.   Come to D10 when you're looking for solid bar food & a sausage fest. This is just a down-home, feel good dive bar. Like old underwear, it's comfortable & reassuring. But seriously, drinks are reasonably priced, plenty of regulars, & if you're lucky, a pretty girl or two will stumble in.  Edit: I came back to pregame prior to the Mayweather/Pac fight & I was treated poorly by one of the bartenders there. I won't say (it rhymes with phalangēē) her name but she's curvier & she has dark hair, she wore a hat the night she served us. My friends and I sat at the elbow of the bar and she served us. The first question she asked me was, "Are you going to cause any trouble tonight? I had to kick you out last time." I told her no, I've never been kicked out of Draw 10 or any bar for that matter. She kept insisting she had kicked me out. I told her no. Then she said, "I know I've kicked you out because you & Ryan got too rowdy the other night." I told her I don't have a friend named Ryan. She kept insisting that she had kicked me out in the past (at least 4-5 times) & each time I told her no. Now I realize all us Black folks look alike, (I mean I look like Denzel, who looks like Obama, who looks like Danny Glover, who looks like Kid President, who looks like Morpheus from The Matrix. All us look alike, right?) but when someone tells you NO 5 times & you still insist on it, you should probably chill out. Messed up my whole mood for the evening.   Anyway, this used to be a 5-star review until tonight. Tegan is still great, but the rest of these folks need a lesson in customer service.

He discovered it after checking his account. Ridiculous.

Tried it on a whim Saturday (5/12/2012) night. Pretty much blew my mind. I had the pizza blanco with sausage & pepperoni. Picked it up and took it home. AMAZING. The crust is fantastic & the favors are just right. The only negative was the cashier, she was kinda awkward, but whatever.   I don't really give 5 stars but this place deserved it, highly recommend this place, you won't regret it!

Jackie the owner is a sweetheart and always welcoming. The food is fresh, homemade and outstanding. Try the baked pancakes for a new crispy twist on an old favorite. 5-stars! Keep up the good work!   Edit: 2/25/16  I was perusing my old bookmarks & came across Kathy's restaurant. I am still sad I can't get anymore of her baked pancakes. The best pancakes in the city folks!  Jackie if you're reading this, please come back to us! We miss you!
