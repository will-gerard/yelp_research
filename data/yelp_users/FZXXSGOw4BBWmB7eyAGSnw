I was to have a lunch meeting here, but it took me a while to find this place.  Why? - I'm still a moron while navigating Arizona streets, and I get confused with "N"orth and "S"outh addresses. - I ALSO found out that the numbering and directions change depending on the city.  As I was travelling North on Alma School in Chandler, I then turned around after a while because I saw I wanted a "South" address.  After much confusion, I finally found the bland, yet clean restaurant in the mini-mall BEHIND Safeway, and had a good meeting.  After the meeting broke, I ordered a bulkogi and chicken combo, and the owner, Ray, sat down to chat with me.  We talked about how we both missed Oakland Chinatown and complained about the Arizona heat.  He told me about how he moved to Arizona some 30 years ago with his wife (who is from Hawaii), and how they started this restaurant a good 20 odd years ago, before the plate lunch fad hit the mainland.  And he told me that weekends are a good time to come, so he can set me up with a new girlfriend.  Work your magic, Ray!

1.  It's a bar in a supermarket complex.  2.  And I got turned away at the door tonight, because I was wearing dark nondescript sneakers.   3.  Did I say it's a bar in a supermarket complex?  I was to meet some co-workers here tonight, my first time out socializing in Scottsdale.  Since the evening weather dropped to below 70, I changed out of my shorts and flip-flops and dusted off my Bay Area hipster gear (long sleeve jersey tee, blue jeans, nondescript black sneakers, and jumped onto the 101.  I was looking for some trendy area, with little boutique stores, restaurants, bar scenes and bums asking for spare change.  Instead, I was greeted by gas stations, a CVS Pharmacy, a crowded parking lot (with, oooh!, valet parking!), and a long line to get in.  When I got to the front of the line, I was carded.  No problem with that.  Then the bouncer got a whiff of my god awful sneakers and kicked me to the curb.  Are you kidding?  A supermarket bar with a no-sneakers policy?  "Heavens forbid we allow any riff-raff in our fine establishment!" had half a mind to put up a real stink, but instead called my friend inside and had a loud-mouthed ranting conversation with him about the idiot policy, while the other line-standers looked at me uncomfortably.  I should just stay in Tempe and party with my students...

In a city full of Fry's supermarkets, Sunflower Market is an excellent alternative for ASU denizens looking for cheapish foods, Hippie-style, especially since the only Trader Joe's is quite a drive away.  On weekends, they occasionally have BBQs...I grabbed 2 hamburgers for 2 bucks yesterday.

I agree with Chris L.; I was disappointed with the cafe.  Granted, I was looking for a college-type coffeehouse where I could grade papers, and this place just didn't have that sort of lounge-y feel that even certain Starbuck$$ have.  There was no background music being played, and even with my ipod/headphones on, I was distracted by nearby conversations.  I got much more work done at 3 Roots near campus.

Meh. Not a bad general used book store for the West Valley, but it's not Changing Hands or Bookman's. I stopped by since I had a Groupon and was in the area, but couldn't find anything real cool finds as I do elsewhere. Mainly used paperback best sellers, bibles, and other stuff you'd find at a mall Waldenbooks. Sure, support your small businesses if you live in the area, but don't go out of your way.

Worst Trader Joe's ever! Never coming back here! Granted, I live in the East Valley, and only stopped by because I was in the neighborhood.  First, the place is filled with the olds, probably due to it's close proximity to Sun City. Thus, imagine the typically cramped isles of TJ combined with self-absorbed old couples standing in the middle of each isle, arguing with each other about what food to buy! Normally, I have no truck with the elderly, however, these must be the folks who voted for their fellow olds, Jan Brewer, complaining how immigants are ruining AZ. How about we talk about how the snowbirds are making our shopping so much more difficult?  Secondly, I ended up with the most surely cashier I've ever had at a TJ. Before ringing up my one 6pack, she eyed my suspiciously. "Just how old are you?"  I understand that clerks are supposed to ID people, and I always have my ID ready to show. However, her suspicion floored me, as I surprisingly  stammered "I'm 40!!!" while showing her my papers. (BTW, I'm not white!) She studied it for a good 15 seconds and then continued to ring up my stuff, without the requisite pseudocompliment.  "Oh, you just look soooo young for your age" joke. C'mon, what underaged teen is going to try to pass off as a 40 year old?  Upon further reflection, maybe the clerk was none other than crazy loon Jan Brewer? After all, all racist old white women look the same to me!  (One star, because the friendly clerk who gave me the sausage/mustard sample was nice, and agreed that the mustard was "surprisingly good!"

I hate the San Francisco Giants - Minus 3 stars! I hate drunk Giants fans - Minus 2 stars! I went to a game where the A's actually lost - Minus 10 stars! I had to park way out at some dirt lot for $5 - Minus more stars! And as Tammy A reports, what is UP with the fascist "NO FOOD" policy!?!?   I understand the no bottles and cans rules for baseball games, I can even tolerate the "empty your water bottles (and refill them at the water fountains) so we know for certain you aren't smuggling vodka or explosives into the stadium," but having the staff actually confiscate my homemade sandwiches and Fry's purchased peanuts at the gate?!?!? - minus 50 Stars for you, because obviously Scottsdale Stadium isn't in the good US of A!  (However, to their credit, my food was actually still there to be picked up after the game!)  I did enjoy the Fall League hall of fame display, tho. And since I'm obviously biased, lets just say 2 stars, and never come back here again, especially when Phoenix Muni, the home of the Oakland A's, is practically walking distance from my place.

(Testing out this new iPhone app!) Carry the world's problems on my shoulders has been a pain in the neck, so I began investigating my AZ State health insurance plan to see what I could get, before I get canned or before AZ decides to discard all benefits and lower wages so McCain and Sheriff Joe can buy bigger guns.  Coworker recommended this place, Dr. Genet is great, staff friendly, low copay. Weight of the world...still there, but body (and mind) is better able to deal!

Signing up for AZ gov't health insurance and my other benefits for my job was a total "Sicko/The Office" mashup, but I was so surprised when the random doctor I called from my insurance website was at the Mayo Clinic!  It took me another 6-8 weeks to get hooked up with a Resident (it would have taken me 2-3 months to get a "real" doctor), but the wait was well worth it.  My first two visits have been well worth the $10 copayments.  This is the first time that I've had great, intelligent, and LENGTHY conversations with doctors and nurses about health issues.  None of those 2 hours in the waiting room for 5 minutes of bothering the doctor with your problems.  However, it is interesting that most of the clients are elder folks from other places, and I'm not talking about Sun City.  So many clients seem to be from other states with such fantastic medical issues in need of treatment that I feel like the staff looks at me funny when I tell them "I'm a local, here for a general checkup."  However, no 5 stars for you, since you still made me wait a long time to get me into the system.  Furthermore, how come my insurance does not cover MENTAL health issues with you guys?  Yeah, I know that's a complaint for Schaller Anderson.

Even though I'm Chinese American, I'm not that bad of a "Chinese Food" snob.  I've eaten my share of "bad" Chinese Food at buffets, cafeterias, and even the garbage I try to make at home.  Sometimes, eating out is all about "MPD" -- Mass Per Dollar -- where can I fill my belly the most by paying the least.  Little Szechuan is the closet neighborhood Chinese restaurant, however I've been too scared to eat here.  Why?  From the outside, it looks like a porn shop.  (Can I say that here?)  It is a freestanding nondescript white brick building with all the windows blacked out, and no menu posted at the door.   I like to look thru the windows before entering a place, so I at least know what I'm getting myself into.  The only identifying thing about the outside of the restaurant is their sign.  They just installed a new sign, which looks exactly like the old sign, but different color.  But both signs exclaimed, "Open since 1976."  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Most Chinese restaurants are family owned and operated, with high staff turnover rates.  If you have a successful restaurant, you may move on to Bigger and Better things, fix up your old place, or sell your business to someone else.  Is this porn shop Chinese Restaurant circa 1970s some hidden Tempe gem of an institution?  And what does it mean that only one other Yelper has reviewed this restaurant in its 30 year history?  I finally convinced a friend to go with me.  He told me to get used to the porn shop aesthetics, because there are plenty of other places in AZ that look like this.  Its not about privacy, he assured me, its about that gosh darn summer Sun.   Thus, I was comforted with the inside of the building, because it had the look and feel of the Chinese Restaurants I know and love  in the SF Bay Area.  1970s wood paneled walls, "Orientalized" promotional knicknacks from Bud or Tsingtao, and other Asian artwork.  I chatted with the friendly server, who informed me that she moved to AZ from China to attend ASU in the early 1970s, and eventually opened the restaurant after graduating.  Indeed, there was history in this restaurant and on the walls.  The menu had a lot of choices, including lunch specials.  Did we find a hidden gem?  Our first dish, Mu Shu Vegetables were great, so we remained hopeful for our main dishes.  Then, our hopes were dashed.  The Hunan Beef was spicy (actually, too spicy for me, but I'm a wimp), but the sauce had a weird texture, flavor, and color.  Their House Special Chow Mein was very unspecial, and I forgot what was wrong with the homemade dumplings.  Needless to say, I did not finish my dinner nor did I bring leftovers home.  What a rollercoaster! --Looks bad from outside --Looks nicer inside --Food terrible --Service nice and friendly.  The restaurant seems to have regular customers, and I applaud them.  Maybe the restaurant makes some other dishes really great, or they like the ambiance, or whatever.  I may try one of their lunch rice plates someday if I'm desperate, but alas, I'm still hunting for the best hole-in-the-wall Tempe Chinese Restaurant.

We caught the tail end of the weekend Dim Sum rush around 1pm on Sunday.  American-born teenager hosts gave us our number, explaining we would have to wait 5 minutes for a clean table.  The room was full of Asian American patrons, including my student who recommended this place to me.  Once seated, we immediately got tea and a whole bunch of stuff, since the "cart lady" was right beside us as we sat.  The food was the best Chinese food I've eaten in Arizona (which isn't saying much.)  However, I do agree that the food is in par with my San Franciscan experiences.  Service:  Gruff, sloppy, yet nothing out of the ordinary for an independent, immigrant-run busy business. Speed:  Random - some dishes were plentiful, but I only saw the don tot egg tarts during the beginning of our feast. Grease factor:  low! Price:  Nice!  The three of us gorged on a $30 bill.  Much better grub than C-Fu.  Will eat here again!

As I walked thru the door, the bartender practically greeted me by name!  This was Saturday at 1pm, and I don't even remember ever being here before.  Have I been unconsciously living some sort of shadow life with the daydrinkers?  Oh, that's right, I met the bartender before at my drinking buddy's BBQ party.  Still, it's nice to find a comfortable bar where one can relax a bit and engage in chatter with the regulars.  The Men's room continues to be 5+ stars!

Don't come here on Sundays, because I'm usually here trying to write my Great American Dissertation and will scowl at you if you make too much noise.  (Tho I don't scowl at the staff, who are friendly yet talkative.)  The parking lot is small and often crowded.  However, I've parked in the adjacent lot behind the closed bike shop, and have not yet been towed or ticketed.

Phoenix Municipal Stadium is an appropriate home for the Spring Training Oakland Athletics, as it has the same "old school" feel as the Oakland Coliseum: a basic slab of concrete with green seats, priced somewhat cheaper than other stadiums.   The stadium is rather small compared to the Giants monstrousity in Scottsdale, thus you can actually get "bleacher seats" that are close to First or Third base.  The games I went to this season had pleasant baseball weather, tho some not-so-pleasant baseball fans who mercilessly heckled all the rookies, as well as any fans who would happen to drop a foul ball.  Fortunately, no nazi security guards here:  one can bring your own food into to park and sealed bottles of water.  Happily, they go by the honor system and just asked me "You have sealed water bottles in here, right?" as they fondled my bag and let me pass.  However, don't talk to your friends while the Star Spangled Banner is playing, or you'll get "SHUSHED" by your elders, as I did.

I used to have total issues with Costcos in California; I always got claustrophobic in their dimly lit warehouses packed with zooming carts and crying kids.  I'd never go on Fridays or weekends because those days were particularly difficult to even find parking!  So it has come to my great relief that even on weekends one can find parking at this Costco.  I have never yet been blindsided by a cart full of crying kids.  The queue for their cheap gas is never ten cars deep.  A hot dog combo is still $1.50.  I even spied a whole display of Nintendo Wii's there during the holiday consumer rush!  However, no 5 stars for this Costco, as they NEVER carry my staples of caffeine free Diet Coke or Nutella.

Come for the great medical care, STAY FOR THE FOOD!  Luckily, my health insurance paid for an overnight sleep test here at the Mayo Clinic Hospital, and as usual, the medical care was great.  Staff was attentive and helpful, and I even got to watch streaming movies on their TV (Harry Potter...no Adult channels tho)  However, their cafeteria is top notch!  The next morning,  I stumbled out of my sleep test at 7AM into the cafeteria and was amazed at the great selection of breakfast choices at such low prices.  I had a made-to-order omelet and two pancake breakfast with Starbucks coffee, all for the low price of under $5!  They also have affordable lunch and dinner specials.  I'd feel uncomfortable recommending people to go to the hospital only for the best, cheap breakfast this side of Denny's Grand Slam promotions, so I won't.   Instead, check to see if your health insurance covers Mayo Clinic care, and then you can eat here any time (gosh forbid) you or your loved ones need hospital care.

I'm still amazed that, yes indeed-y, the cost of living in Phoenix is cheaper than the San Francisco Bay Area.    I was amazed to find Airport parking for $10 a day, even cheaper with a coupon found on the internets.   Of course, the lot is amidst all the crazy construction near the airport, so I had to navigate the closed streets to find the place.  Service was friendly enough for bored workers--the bus driver kindly waited for me to park my car and get on board...because there weren't any other passengers.  It was a quick ride to my terminal.  My return to PHX went well also.  Only had to wait a couple minutes to spot the shuttle bus. My car was fine; just a little dusty, which was to be expected.  The cashier had trouble processing my coupon--not her problem, but the darn computer was acting up.  Manager soon arrived--and he comped my whole stay.   "Sorry for the delay, sir, (it was only a couple minutes!)"  Free parking is always good parking, Daddy used to say.  Overall, I was impressed by their customer service.  Perhaps its just because they are new, but I hope not.  I'll use 'em again!

I WANT to like this cafe, because I'm such a fervent supporter of libraries.  However, this new cafe inside the Tempe library still needs some kinks worked out.  The upshot of this story is:  it took me about 15 minutes to get my mocha.  A young barista had trouble handling two customers ahead of me:  a family w/ kids and then a coffee snob.  The family's issue was simply indecisiveness, whereas the coffee snob wanted a half cap this and that which the teenager had trouble decyphering.  When it was finally my turn, I gave her my reusable commuter mug and asked for my drink.  She said that she'd have to give it to me in a regular disposable cup, and then I could transfer it into my own mug.  Huh?  "Well, that's our policy here..."  Whatever.  Anyhow, the cafe has some sandwiches, some outdoor + indoor seating, free wi-fi and freestanding computer, popular periodicals to read, and, of course, one can bring stuff from the library into the cafe.  A got a little annoyed at the young kids in the cafe, but that's probably MY problem.   Overall, its a decent place to drink and eat while at the Tempe library.  Next time, however, I think I'll try the Gold Cafe nearby...

EVERYONE loves to harsh on Arizona for being such a hateful place (including me!) However, I've had nothing but great service at the DMV!  Granted, my morning excursion today didn't get completed.  However it wasn't particularly crowded and I got to talk to the woman at the information desk within a minute of entering.  Rather than direct me to another line to wait, she troubleshot my issue quickly, and even APOLOGIZED when she said I would have to go talk to my bank to clear things up before getting my title.  Compared to DMV service in California, Arizona DMV is HEAVEN!!!

Took my geeky friends from out-of-town here, expecting to see Fantastic! Comic! Geek! Stuff! In! Their! Huge! Store! as per their website, but, eh, it's just a regular toy store selling dolls.  Er, "action figures."  Yeah, some cool, rare stuff to see under glass (like the Limited Edition Bruce Lee in Game of Death jumpsuit), but why would I want to Hasbro Star Wars figures here, when I don't even want them from ToysRUs or Target?  I WOULD HAVE purchased McFarlane Toy's "Sun" and "Jin" from Lost, but apparently they don't stock their own stuff in large supplies.  (I could have gotten poor old Mr. Eko on clearance, but eh...)

After 2.5 years in Phoenix, I've decided that I deserve a couch!  Of course I've had couches in previous chapters of my life, and those things are overpriced bulky behemoths that are a horror to transport.  First I haunted the various furniture stores going out of business, and alas, I still can't afford a couch that is $800 AFTER the 50% discount.  Second, tried Craigslist. Boy, used couches don't photograph well.  Why would I spend $200+ for a nasty, dirty, floral couch!  Thus, I was intrigued with the IRCA mailing I received with the weekly supermarket flyers.  They purchase used stuff from hotels renovating (or closing, I suppose) fix stuff up and re-sell it to the public (or other fleabag hotels renovating with their stuff.)  Picture frames for $10! Sleeper sofas for $175! Other stuff for cheap! screams the ad.  Thus, I trekked out here the other day, a large warehouse filled with stuff.  Don't expect lavish customer service or nice decor; it's a warehouse, it's a thrift-y store.  And thus, fun to explore? Did I want a player piano?  Huge tubed TVs? Lamps replete with AC jacks?  Any need for 100 functional coffee machines or hair dryers once attached to bathroom walls. No, I wanted a couch.    They had a couple of sectionals, but mainly love seats, recliners, sleeper sofas, and other "regular" sofas that are found in hotels and lobbies and etc.  They had some old fashioned stuff that once populated "Lawrence Welk" (show? Hotel?) some faux leopard skinned chaise lounge and red, white, and black leather sofas (solid red, solid white, solid black, not striped!) probably from fancier hotels that I never go to.  Most was in the $400+ range, and really, not what I wanted.  I spied a solid, functional, clean green sofa sleeper that the tag proudly exclaimed once lived in a Westin hotel.  And I fell in love with the $175 price point. There were a couple couches cheaper, perhaps $149, but those looked a pad bit dirty and skanky for even my standards.  I found a salesperson, and simply said "I want that one," and he didn't try to upsell me on anything else.  They do deliver, but it's by mileage, so this thing would have cost me over $100 to bring to my place.  Thankfully, they hold merchandise for 7 days, long enough me to convince friend-with-truck to assist for the low price of a good meal.

(Shhh, I'm trying to stay awake at work, so writing this review!) Last Saturday, out-of-town friends and I found ourselves in this neck of the woods for the first time to visit the monstrosity that is the sports arenas/shopping malls. (NEVER AGAIN!!!)  Made our first mistake going to a Yelp approved Mexican joint that made us pay a cover charge to enter, that promised they'd have seating inside, but didn't.  We were hungry, so we were happy to find that this place had seating and was not crawling with drunken wrestling fans.  I was particularly thrilled with their milkshakes for $3.50!  My Bison Burger was HUGE (1/2 pounder), but I think I made a mistake and should have built more toppings into it, because it was overall a bit dry.  For you non Beef eaters, they also have salads  Owner and Servers were friendly, and I liked the blue, clean ambiance.  It did it's job well!
