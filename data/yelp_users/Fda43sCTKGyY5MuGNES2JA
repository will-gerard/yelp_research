This used to be my go to Chipotle, compared to the one at Alma cause their rice was always undercooked. But I might head back there now cause like stated before on other reviews, the portions SUCK! The amount of food they give: whether it's rice, meat, salsa, etc., its all VERY LITTLE. not to mention the workers there are never happy. Never. Again.

Mozzarella and spinach quiche too cheesy. Mexican meatball soup was amazing. Meatloaf sandwich was good. Tangerine lemonade was really good. Freshly squeezed. Nice environment. Artwork on walls for sale.

Not impressed at all! Rice is under cooked, crab puffs were inconsistent; either huge and super cheesy, or a tiny folded crisp. Shrimp tasted weird. The delivery guy kind of spilled the sauce so the bottom of the bag was drenched. Delivery speed was mediocre. Don't think I'll order from here again unless I'm desperate.

Had breakfast here on Labor Day. Best French toast I've had in a while. Lots of pastries available on display. Wish I had room in my stomach for it. Pancakes were pretty good as well.

Hot dog. Good. Cheese fries. Could be better. Was given regular fries with a small cup of cheese which tasted of nothing. Literally was just, I can't even describe it. It was not cheese... I would come back for the hotdog though. Very soft buns.
