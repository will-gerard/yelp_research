The Compass has the most amazing view of Phoenix!! The rotating restaurant has a very romantic feel-great for date night! Order the filet mignon with the mashed potatoes. Divine!

The atmosphere is very upscale/romantic. The menu is limited but in a good way. Try the homemade pasta - it's unreal!

The atmosphere was cool and the food was good but overpriced and the drinks were outrageous. Service was very poor. We barely got a how do you do.... Chances that I'll be back are slim.

The worst service I've ever had. We were there for over an our and were never approached by a server.
