What would a visit to Las Vegas be without stopping by to see the Pawn Stars, Chumlee, Corey, Rick and the "Old Man." Being it was Veterans Day I thought getting my picture taken with the "Old Man", a fellow Navy Vet, would be just the thing. We arrived to find several hundred other people had ALSO decided to stop by. A large crowd was outside the door, standing around, taking pictures, just hanging out. Inside was filled, shoulder to shoulder, almost too crowded to hold up a Chumlee tshirt or find those much desired "Gold and Silver Pawn" key chains. We had pushed about 8 feet into the store when the security guy at the door said "CLEAR the store for filming. Every OUT!" He was standing up, a big guy, so we turned around and moved outside again. Dona said "No, we are NOT going to hang around to see what happens... " Anyway, happy vets day Old Man!!

I wanted to like this place, but no.  We used Open Table to make a reservation and were excited to see what great reviews were about.  Sorry, but just not our kind of place.  Small tight tables, elbow to elbow with the next table.  It was dark lighting and I mean DARK to the point of needing a flashlight to read the menu.  The menu had soft leather covers and was filled with mysterious fu fu selections even the staff said was hard to understand.  We order guacamole prepared tableside at $12, fresh, pretty good.  And we ordered a cheese plate, five or six bites but meant to look pretty.  My wife ordered an entry salad which arrived and clearly could feed three people.  I ordered scallops, got six large ones, pretty tasty.  And I had a side of chipotle grits, so so.  We had Corona Lite.  Total bill with tip:  $120.  Yes, there was an active bar scene.  Yes, the staff was super attentive and very nice.  Background music and noise was too loud.  Parking across the street was free.  All in all, we would not recommend this restaurant.
