This place is AWESOME!!!  If you like your pasta dishes with 1 pound of butter and olive oil in it.  For some strange reason, I do not.  So, I say this place sucks!  I did give it two stars because of the great service and decent ambiance.  However, out of the three pasta dishes we had, the only thing that was mediocre was the Lasagna.  We won't be back.

The service was not the best, but what does one expect from a " Mom & Pop" Korean shop?  The upside was the food; probably one of the best Korean BBQ places in the Valley at the moment. Try the beef tongue.. Yummy!!
