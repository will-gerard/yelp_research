Had a birthday party there. It housed our 80 really close friends and a couple more parties. A gf ordered the chicken enchiladas, which usually are dry and not so good. I tried hers and ordered my own. Fantastic food and service. Excellent atmosphere! Completely satisfied, and I'm hard person to satisfy with food. I'll be back real soon.

The best in AZ! Great staff, never a turn around! They remember you! And they have the best crab puffs with cream cheese and my favorite, although I've tried several and NEVER a bad meal is: House Chicken, little but spicy but perfect breast chicken. Hard to find that in Asian places. All my love, all my referrals! Wonton Lady!

I've been going to Splendid Nails on 32nd St. and Thunderbird since 2001, everyone there is so great and have never given my a bad manicure, pedicure, nail tips and/or wax. They know what they are doing.   They are funny, caring people. I agree with Nikki F., never complain, in English anyway, but I know a couple of them personally and they don't judge, we have intelligent conversations and both men and women there are great.   Everyone I've recommended there, which are many, have always returned and said only great things as well. I've also sat next to people that have felt they are the greatest. When I travel, which is often, I make sure I get my nails done before I go and when I get back. If I'm gone for more than needed to get them done, I'm always disappointed and overcharged.   I've also never gotten an infection from the nails, if I gotten nail tips, and if I have gotten nail tips, they last a very long time, no coming off. I rescue dogs of all breeds and used to work and live on a farm, so I'm pretty tough on them and my feet.  I highly recommend this Splendid Nails on 32nd St and Thunderbird to anyone of all ages, for all events...or just to get your nails done.

I literally live 2 mins from this place. He took my address when I called, he started taking my order, then when I wanted to add vegetable friend rice, he interrupted me and said he couldn't deliver. VERY RUDE!  I just moved here, never again! This is NOT how you treat customers.

Went to see the show "Stomp" with a girlfriend, of many years, at ASU Gammage! I had a blast and it was a really great show! Would definitely go again to experience a show there!

I went to this nail salon 3/5/2016. I read the reviews and couldn't wait to try it. The reviews are dead-on about being a fantastic place and fantastic owners! Brian-husband helped his wife Leelee (??) with everything and both were friendly and the place was comfortable. So glad I went. Plus, price was definitely affordable!

The service (Janean) was nothing less than excellent, the food was very very good. When I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely visit again. I had the smothered chicken, collard greens, mashed potatoes and the sweet potatoes. And ended it with the banana pudding (which was excellent). Love love it!

Always had a great experience with the Fry's and the Wells Fargo! Had any bad food and returns have been a breeze and I rented a Rug Doctor so many times and they stand by their word! Love this Fry's. Feels weird to shop at any other Fry's

It seems every time I come to this Pharmacy, they are not organized or they promise a time and it's never ready. I'll go to the one on 3975 E. Thunderbird, Phoenix, AZ 85032. Ask for Mary! She's the best!! This place has horrible service in Pharmacy!

There is a big hype about this place, but...my gf and I ordered each of us a burger, after moving. Was looking forward to the delicious food. We watched a video review about them on "Check Please, Arizona" great reviews. Ugh. I would easily say I'm a foodie, and know what food should taste like. I got my "burger" the New Yorker, which was highly recommended by the show and by the cashier. The pastrami was fresh, their coleslaw was okay, the burger wasn't even cooked and it wasn't  2 cm thick. And it was worse than a few fast food burgers. Ugh!! Then, when you walk into the place, it looks like a grocery store. Not real inviting. The wall of different soda pops was cool, but way over rated! I will never go back to this place. Not good enough food to retry! Sorry, just my opinion.

I absolutely love this place! 2.99 breakfast (pssst-not small portions! Owner is usually there. The cooks are great especially the overnight cook-Kim. ALL the staff is very friendly. It's a small town feel and they remember you when you come back. I'm a regular there at least 4 days a week
