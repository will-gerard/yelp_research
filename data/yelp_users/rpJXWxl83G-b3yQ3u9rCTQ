Oak's is the greatest breakfast place in Arizona. I will never get tired of the questions pankcakes or toast on the side. Pancakes always wins, always. Stay hungry my friends.

The Chalet is the best. They always have what I'm looking for, whether its' GoPro accessories, a new ski jacket or a waterproof bag to take with me snorkeling they have it. Pretty decent rewards program with them as well saved myself $10 bucks today! Great to see a place that carries stock, so nice getting items same and not having to wait for UPS to drop everything off.

Big Earls is da bomb!! Butter burger, big kahuna, root beer floats, it's always worth waiting for (even during season behind the blue hairs).

This has been a great place to live we just renewed our lease! Never had any issues with maintenance or noise. Always quick to fix any problems and they replace our air filter every month. All in all a good experience and great location.

Since The Tipton group has acquired this property any sense of intellect have gone out the window. When calling them to inquire about a new $2 fee to pay online the first response was, "We don't know what this is."   They stated a guest brought this up yesterday, however if I did not bring a check into the office by 5PM tomorrow to avoid paying online I would be charged. It's not the $2 I'm concerned over, it's the principal of the matter and the fact that they will not even try to provide any type of solution to any problems that arise.

Jimmy Johns has always made great sandwiches, now that they have some new management they deserve a 5 review. A few months ago I didn't want to step into this place because of the attitude that smacked you in the face on the way in. They have some new guys running the show and you can tell. Everybody is nice and their attitudes now reflect the usual freaky fast service. Keep up the good work, glad to see things have turned around.

Dr. Coffman was great! She is located right inside of the Target Optical center at Desert Ridge and has a great staff that walk you through all of their pricing for glasses and contacts. The appointment was quick and painless and she was very friendly throughout the whole thing. After buying my contacts they let me know as well that I am eligible for 50% prescriptions frames (still expensive), but this is a nice benefit of her being located within Target.  Overall great experience and no pressure sales to purchase frames onsite.
