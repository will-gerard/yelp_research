I have been here 3 times.  The first two times the food was good and everyone was nice.  It's a little dirty and dark in the dining room, but I don't mind an old divey place if the food is good.  Yesterday I went there with a colleague for lunch and they brought us water.  We waited for 15 minutes for the server and then left and went to Pei Wei instead because there were 3 other tables waiting for the server when we got there.  And they weren't that busy.

I just had air duct cleaning for my home and they did a great job.  They explained everything before and after.  They were done in the time that they alloted.  They also cleaned 2 chiminies.  They did so good that I had them come 3 days later and do air duct cleaning at my commercial building.  The a/c feels so much better and the building cools down faster.  They were a little bit more expensive in their quote than other companies, however the other companies charge extra for every little thing and Top Hatter just charges a flat fee.

These guys are clean, professional, and respectful of your property and fixtures.  They go above and beyond with the service and they are extremely polite.  Not only did they show up on time, they showed up a little early but were courteous enough to ask if it was ok to get started, or if I wanted them to wait till the quoted time of arrival.  They made some great recommendations also on frequency of service that seemed reasonable rather than a promotion.

This was my 2nd time here.  If you order the mussels for a starter, be prepared...  they bring enough to feed 4 people.  The wine sauce with the mussels was the best I've had. My only complaint, there was no bucket.  You have to shell on your appetizer plate.  I had a beef dish that was marinated in brandy or some liquor.  Delicious.  My wife had Mahi and she loved it.  The service is 5-star.  Wine list is insane and they have a lot of wines by glass.  They also have a great selection of rare drinks like buddhahand vodka.  Lastly, I'm always a big fan of complimentary valet parking.

They do monthly and sometimes bi-monthly service at my commercial building, depends on climate and the time of the year.    I don't even have to schedule it as they check the building intermittently on their own schedule and do the service in their own professional discretion.  I've never had to worry about weed growth and the rates are very reasonable. They have won my trust 100%.  Highly recommended for any commercial landlord or for residential maintenance.

I have only been here for brunch.  I had one of the greatest gourmet burgers.  The design and ambience is one-of-a-kind.  I can't wait to go there for dinner.

Great quality sushi here at a great price.  I've had lunch here once with a bento box which makes you full, full, full.  All other times I called in and got take-out sushi.  They will tell you 15 minutes for pick up, but it's more like 25.  Once they forgot wasabi and soy sauce and chop sticks in my take-out bag.  Other than that this is the best sushi in central phoenix.

I have ate here twice.  Very convenient location at 32nd st. and indian school.  The first time I ate here was about 1 year ago and I had the Thai wrap.  It was not very good in my opinion and had no thai flavor at all.  So I didn't go back.  Then I just went 5 days ago out of convenience to grab n go back to my office.  I ordered what is now my favorite turkey sandwich in all of Phoenix.  I'm definitely a fan.  I'm reluctant to order anything else.  There is a long wait for your food, but it's always busy, and good food takes time.  I can care less for the cookie but I'm not much of a sweet tooth.  So go to bertha's, and just get the turkey sandwich!

Not only have I had other personal trainers in the past , I am also a seasoned chiropractor and certified strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS).  So when I was searching for a new trainer, I wanted someone who new even more than I did.  That's when I got introduced to Dan Siegal at Peak Performance in August of 2008. It's functional training at it's finest.  Body weight, balance, bands, kettlebells, etc...  they use functional movement to produce strength that I never thought was possible for myself.  They have showed that you could be in the best shape of your life at any age.

I have been getting my haircut at Salon Jo-El since 2001.  I come from a family of stylists and I can honestly say that this salon has the highest quality stylists.  I have seen 3 different stylists there over the years, and they were consistently trained.  All T & G trained stylists, both male and female.  The decor is clean, upscale and modern.  They have Grant Wiggins' artwork up right now.  Very cool.  Now Rachel cuts my hair.  She takes time to make sure I have both a professional look and some style for the weekend. I highly recommend Rachel for gentlemen that care about healthy style.

I love the design.  We walked into Crush lounge and had a drink first.  Very friendly bartenders, great decor.  There are 3 giant original and sexy photographs above the bar.  The main dining room is loud and energetic, which I like, and the design is super contemporary and open.  Lots of glass.  The menu is very French, but not intimidating.  The bell pepper bisque is really good, but as a healthy eater I noticed how heavy it was.  I also had the filet mignon au poivre, possibly the best filet I have ever had.  The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is because of our server.  He was good, but he had a lot of tables and I noticed he was rushing us a little.  Overall, this place is world-class and I will be back to Christopher's very soon.

Great esthetician.  Very clean place with contemporary design and great artwork.  There's plenty of places to park and everything happens on time so if you are as busy as I am, they make sure you are in and out at the expected times.

This is the greatest pilates studio.  My results from training here for 6 months are unbelievable.  I feel like they have transformed my body.  I'm 1/2" taller since I started because they have manipulated my posture actively to engage my back muscles permanently to hold my spine more upright.  My back and abs are ripped now and I'm performing sports and other strength training exercises at a very high athletic level.  They are very sensitive to your past injuries and customize every workout for you.  The design of the studio is cool.  really modern and revitalizing.  If youre into fitness they will take you to a whole other level.

We did our baby shower registry here and have had a great experience.  They gave us 10% off anything that was not purchased as gifts off of our registry.  I disagree with Jason B's review of the store content.  Actually, I found out about this store because they have a wide selection of organic and alternative products that are not mass-produced and are difficult to find.  The staff is very well-trained in the products and spend time showing you all the features, especially with functional and mechanical products like strollers, car seats, etc.  My most recent experience there was when I went to purchase a baby scale (which no one else in phoenix carries).  It was a bit more expensive than buying it online, but they even honored the online price of Walmart and gave me a $15 discount.    The only reason I give this store 4 starts instead of 5...  They have  a low in-stock quantity of many products that have color choices, so we had to wait a week for them to order several products.  Lastly, I want to mention that their return policy is good, no hassles for me.

I don't always eat burger, but when I do I prefer SMASHBURGER.  There are a lot of good burger spots in town.  There are cheaper ones, high-end ones.  Smashburger falls in the middle, but is as good as  a high-end burger spot.  I got the Arizona burger.  Beef is high-quality, veggies are fresh, bread choices are good (you can get multi-grain bun).  I didn't get any sides.  I noticed on the menu that you can make your own burger by picking out the bread, the patty size, sauce, etc.

I have been here 3 times. Once just for drinks, once for lunch, and once for the sunday brunch.  They have an excellent diverse menu.  At a glance, the menu is american but seems to be inspired by mediterranean, middle eastern, indian, caribbean and latin american flavors.   I love the wings, burgers, steak salad, chicken sandwich.  Cons: they put way too much cheese on everything, the salsa and guacamole is below average.  And the thing I love most about this place is the design.  They took a mid-century modern bank and turned into an ultra sleek modern tavern.

I have been using AMS at my commercial building since 2002.  They are on time, quick but attention to detail with a noticeable clean-up job of debris, leaves, etc.  I have also used them to do a complete landscape plan for one of my homes in the past.  They even replaced a tree that died over the winter.  If you are shopping around you will find that AMS is on the more expensive side, however in Arizona you really do get what you pay for in terms of landscaping and maintenance.

I used to think America's Taco Shop was the best, but I was wrong.  I found Taco heaven here.  I get take out here about once per month.  I've had the chicken street tacos, carne asada burrito.  You can mix and match anything on the menu and they are cool with it.  I've never dined in but it is a very sleek casual design.  The staff is really friendly and it seems like it's a family-run dining room.  And it's super reasonable prices.

I was disappointed that they ran out of the mussels I ordered.  I ended up having the short ribs.  Amazing.  My wife had the shepard's pie and I tasted it.  It was also amazing.  I also had the red pepper soup.  Probably the 2nd best red bell soup I have had.  We also had the chocalate covered bacon smores dessert.  Yes we did.  And yet you should at least try it.  Our server was perfect and the decor is very modern rustic.  Make a reservation, this place is packed (as they deserve to be)

I'm way overdue to write a review about CFF.  I should begin by saying that I have been a chiropractor, trainer and strength and conditioning coach for 10 years.  I have been involved with CrossFit since 2008.  I was a medic at the CrossFit regionals in 2011.  In the last 2 years I have been to 3 CF gyms in the valley.  When I re-located to Scottsdale from central phoenix, I had to find a new box.  I called one in the area and they wouldn't even give me pricing over the phone so they were out.  I went to one other box that was as big as my living room and the coaches just didn't know enough exercise physiology.  They were out.  I walked into CrossFit Forbidden, met the coaches, and It felt like home.  This place is world-class.  It is very-well equipped with lots of room.  They can accommodate 30 people per class.  The programming is the smartest and most impressive I have seen in the region.  Lots of concept 2 rowers, a long asphalt alley in the back for running, 2 bathrooms, 2 showers, a protein and nutrition bar, lots of mobility equipment (for mWODs).  I may be a serious athlete and I look at CF as a sport, But I have referred the most novice people to exercise, and the coaches have helped them lose weight, achieve goals, and retain their fitness.  Prices are very reasonable.  My last advice is:  if you are going to get into cross fit, get a feel for the gym equipment, space, coaching, and programming before you make a commitment.  If Crossfit Forbidden is a convenient location for you, then it's the best choice in the area. Once you start here, you won't want to go anywhere else.  Cancel the big box gym membership and get into Crossfit.

Cool space, excellent servers but the food was not good.  I had the chicken caesar wrap.  There was bones other unknown chicken parts in the sandwich.  It was tasteless.  My wife had the chicken bbq sandwich and I tried that and it was unremarkable aka bleh.  We ordered plain mashed potatoes for our 1-year old and she seemed to like it.  I tried a bite, I mean sip of that and it was softer than soup.  Hopefully they hire a consulting chef and get things right cause I would love to see this space make it.  There are so many greater options in the area, that I really don't see myself going back.

When you are ready to get your luxury vehicle back to looking like when you drove it off the dealership lot, make an appointment at Airpark Auto Spa.  I took my BMW 750 there and purchased the showroom detail and Ryan the owner actually did all of the work.  He spent all day 6-7 hours detailing the vehicle.  He did a 3 layer 3M polish and clay bar that had the paint looking brand new.  The interior was immaculately washed, shampoo, leather conditioning and the engine was steam cleaned to see every detail.  I'm done getting mini-details at the car wash.  This is the real deal experience.  I'm ready to take my Acura SUV now.

I ordered chicken tacos with no cheese to go.  I got to my office and opened a bag of tacos smothered in cheese.  I tried to call, but this place doesn't even have a phone number.  I'm sure the food is good, there is an obvious disconnect from the cashier to the kitchen. Good take-out begins with getting the order correct.

I had my stainless steel 4-burner Master Forge grill cleaned by Joe Filter.  Looks brand new again.  $120 for this service is a great deal.  They are very transparent with their pricing.  Service tech was on time, even though he called me and said he may be a little late because of traffic.  That was very courteous.  I didn't have to stay and pay, they sent me an email invoice with a pay button, clicked and paid.  Easy as it gets.    I will  use them for this service every year and send them a ton of referrals.

went here just to see the outdoor mural on their back wall by artist Andrew Brown.  Impressive. So I went inside to see their menu. So simple loved it. I had the chicken quesadilla. it was perfect casual, and they use great ingredients and local when they can. chef and cook is very conscious of using clean and local ingredients. iced tea was also very fresh and took basic iced tea to another level.
