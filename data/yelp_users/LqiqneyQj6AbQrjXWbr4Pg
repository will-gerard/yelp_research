I'm not one to leave reviews or complain, but this is easily the worst dining experience of my life. The server was very, very rude. She wrote down my fiancés order and still came back to ask what he wanted. My food came out twenty minutes later because they were out of ceviche, which is what I ordered. My fiancés quesadilla was wet and cold. There was gristle in the chicken. When my food finally came out, the potatoes were greasy and undercooked. The bacon was the most over-cooked bacon I have ever seen. It was practically leather. I know I ordered bacon and eggs at a Mexican restaurant but I was afraid to order anything else. With my meal, I asked for a tortilla instead of toast and they still brought toast. I asked her to take my meal back and she didn't even apologize and actually laughed. And on top of all of that, the beer was warm!! This place doesn't even deserve one star. If you want good Mexican, go next door to La Santisima!! Or even, Taco Bell would be better!

They aren't even busy and it takes 15 mins to get a drink. Toby, you need a new bar staff. Worst. Service. Ever.

This past Saturday I went to Stand-up Scottsdale with my boyfriend and his buddy who was visiting from Canada, who would rather be out drinking at a bar than a comedy club but I HAD to see Howard Hughes headline the show. HH is great - he really is in tune with his crowd and during his part of the show you feel like you are getting to know him one-on-one! Being that he is the owner, he also makes sure his guests are taken care of, he noticed we didn't have drinks and sent someone right over. He works very hard to please the crowd and he wouldn't have it any other way!   I have been going to this club since it was at Clarion Hotel/Papi Chulo's and it has been awesome to see the transformation to what it is now.   I will be honest, not all the acts are super hilarious, but it's the experience and atmosphere that matters. Even our Canadian buddy had a great time...and we will continue to come back!

Delicious and great service! It took a while to get seated, but it was well worth the wait. The prices are a little high, but what place isn't these days? Good thing I don't live close, or I would be here every weekend! :)
