I ate there on a friend's recommendation; I won't be asking for any for anymore recommendations.  The two dishes I tried were both overly salty, I'm guessing to mask the flavor.  The quality of food just wasn't that good.  If you looking for food of this nature (un-authentic Chinese), give Pei-Wei or PF Changs a try instead.  They're much, much better.

I'm no Greek food expert, but Jimmy's consistently delivers tasty food.  It's family run, and the bickering among family members is light-hearted and funny.  The place isn't very big, and the atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but it has an inviting family feel to it.  As a side note, they have a Blue Bell ice cream shop next door.

I eat at El Molino an average of once a week for lunch, if that tells you anything.  I like it!  The food is consistently good, the prices are fair, and people who run the place are very nice (Gloria, Lupe, and Richard).  They very thoughtfully have a selection of daily news papers (Wall Street Journal, AZ Republic, etc...) for you to read while waiting for food or while eating.  And, they have free refills on soft drinks.  Warning, if you are super sensitive to spicy food, be very careful when ordering.  Their food can get hot (try the chips and salsa).  And, boy is it good.  I usually split a delicious chicken chimichanga with my wife.  We try to avoid fried food, but their chimis rock!  We occasionally get enchiladas, which are also very tasty.  Probably the only thing I've tried and won't order again (although one of friends does) is their hard shell taco.  It's too oily or greesey for my taste.  But hey, you might like it.  Overall, I highly recommend El Molino.  Enjoy!

I love this place!  The service is good.  But, the yellow curry, pad thai, and crispy basil chicken are all fantastic.  I've tried a few other highly rated Thai restaurants in the Phoenix-metro area, but none match Malee's in atmosphere or food.

This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isn't chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  I've had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce.

Although I've only been to Lisa G once, the service at the bar was great, the food was excellent (I had the Juno sandwich), and the atmosphere was fine.  I look forward to going back soon.  UPDATE: Ok, I've been back to Lisa G several times now with a friend who works in the area.  I must say, I really like the food.  So does my friend.  It's quality stuff, what can I say.  Everyone is friendly; I've never come close to the experience that Nadia C. had.  Although I think she overreacted.  In the owner's defense, she has a small area in the front of the restaurant that she requests people use for meetings after they've finished eating and only if there's a wait.    Since my first visit, I've ordered the Juno again (super yummy!) and Lisa's award winning balls.  I must say, they were quality balls.  My taste buds prefer sweeter balls, but these were really good.  You can tell a lot of love went into making these balls.    When I go I usually drink Voss sparkling water, but they do have an interesting soda collection (as was mentioned previously) that I look forward to sampling in the near future.  I highly recommend you try it at least once.  You can be the judge if it's worth returning to.  I know I'm a repeat customer.

Chipotle has consistently been one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is prepared in front of you as you head down the assembly line towards the cash register.  The ingredients are fresh, never frozen, and always flavorful.  While it's no Cafe Poca Cosa, for fast Mexican food, it's tough to beat.

La's Thai has consistently good Pad Thai, has never messed up my order, and has a friendly staff.  Their other dishes are good too, but I keep returning to the Pad Thai.  The only thing I don't like, but you might, is that the yellow curry has pumpkin in it.  As I eat at La's a few times a month, I'm rounding up their rating to 4 stars.  If I get La's Thai cravings, they must be doing something right.

Excellent customer service, genuinely nice, and knowledgeable.  I went in for a simple M.2 screw for my new SSD, and left with more knowledge than I went in with.  I will definitely be doing business with The PC Fixers again. Highly recommended.
