Parking is HORRIBLE, Sometimes I have to walk 10 minutes to get a spot if I'm lucky. But be warned they will tow your car within minutes of you parking in the wrong spot.  This place is a joke, do not move in here.   They give you only 48 hours to declare any problems with your apartment before you move in, and I don't know about the rest of you but usually I am unpacking for those two days to notce things that are wrong.  The staff is terrible. They don't care about anything at all like noise ordinances as really early in the morning they hire people with leaf blowers and chainsaws as early as 6am.  Go look somewhere else for an apartment these guys may seem fair priced, but there are way better apartments to move to.   I really hate this place and regret moving here

I love this place! I moved a couple of months ago to North Scottsdale and honestly no other shops around here are anywhere near deserving of my business, but my boy John has really stepped it up and really made me feel at home in this town. I really feel welcome by John every time I step in the door! Not only that but this place has everything I need at pretty unbeatable prices.  If you're at all anywhere near here I strongly recommend you stop in.
