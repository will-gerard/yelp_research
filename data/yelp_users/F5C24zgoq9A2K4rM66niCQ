I went into this store in hopes of getting this cute bag I saw in the window the night before. So I'm excited about getting my bag. I walked into the store, NOBODY greeted me at all. Everybody looked, but nobody said anything to me.  I'm like wtf is this about? I proceeded to go look at the bags and another lady walked in and she was greeted so I knew the workers could talk.  Anyway I still looked at the bags and planned on getting one, but I refuse to buy anything from a business that acts like this..  They just lost 150 bucks...

I've really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel is your traditional Hilton vs. most of the hip hotels that are here on the strip. As far as a hotel goes, both are fine with me.   The hotel was very clean and close enough to modern. The kitchen was very clean and equipped with a full kitchen. The kitchen wasn't VERY modern, but definitely not outdated.   I don't remember how many floors the hotel have, but we stayed on the 29th floor.   The room had these card that aren't supposed to deactivate. All you do is hold it up to the sensor and the door unlocks. You also need the card to get up the elevator as well.   The room has a medium sized jacuzzi tub and a stand up shower. The shower was one of those that hold water in the corners. That's kind of annoying to me.   I did love that the hotel didn't have a casino downstairs. For some reason I don't like walking in to a casino EVERY time I go into a hotel. The hotel is also located on the not so busy end of the strip which makes it easier to get in and out.   If you're coming to Vegas to party with your friends and have a wild time I would pick one of the more trendy one. If you're just a very mild couple like us. Then this is the spot for you.

This hotel is what it is. And what it is is a party hotel. It's surroundings are a lot of clubs and bars. So it markets to a more hip young crowd.   Would I recommend this hotel for a family with kids? No, but not because people are walking around nude or anything. There just isn't anything that accommodate children in the area.   Now if your coming to Scottsdale with your friends and plan on partying and having good grown folks fun, this this is your spot.  Okay so the entrance is down stairs near the garage and pool. The garage isn't very large, but neither is the hotel. So its cool, except when all of the night clubs are open; then parking might be a little difficult, but not impossible. Also there is no seating area on the first floor. I had to stand while waiting on my ride. That kinda bothered me a little. The front desk is located on the 2nd floor along with the gym and restaurant. The gym actually is a nice size for that size hotel. The machines are modern and it was very clean.  The room was cute. It gave you that beachy feel. Which is kind of popular in Scottsdale, but odd. Well, because it is Arizona.   The hotel was very clean and well kept.   Now late at night on the weekend. You will hear drunk guests arrive from the club talking very loud in the hallways. I also heard security trying to calm them down. But that's expected when you're at a hotel surrounded by clubs. I'm happy to hear them drunk  and loud in the hallways vs drunk on the road driving. So thats a great thing if you think about it.   Really the hotel was cool. Oh and I've seen people with their dogs, so I take it they're pet friendly.

I didn't really choose this hotel. It was the hotel priceline had given me. But after booking it I looked at their website and the place looked fun.  After reading a couple of reviews on the place they all were good, some okay! But one said something about 21 bucks a day resort fee. I didn't really think anything of it. I was stuck with the hotel anyway, because I had already prepaid for it, so why sweat the small stuff.  When the car dropped me off at the resort, it was really tropical looking and the staff was so friendly. It was kind of weird that the place didn't have a ramp to pull your bags up. But the staff offered to keep your bags at the valet desk while you check in.   The girl at the front desk was very nice and informed me about that 21 dollar resort fee. You know if it was one of the warmer months, I wouldn't mind paying the 21 dollar a day fee because I would be using all of the amenities. But I wasn't going to let it ruin my trip.  The room was cute. I obviously had the "hotwire" room because my balcony was big enough to fit one person. And on the top floor over the trees, so I couldn't see anything at all. But it was cool.  The pool was beautiful. It was too cold to get in. I did use the gym everyday. It was big for a hotel gym, so that was good. And the equipment was modern as well.  Over all the hotel was cool. They didn't have a store there to buy things like snacks and drinks late at night. Which kinda bothered me a little one night I was thirsty. I ended up drinking the hotels 5 dollar water on the counter. Booooo!!!   Minus the 21 dollar resort fee in the winter and not having a store on the premises it wasn't so bad.
