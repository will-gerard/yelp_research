I have three dogs and have been coming to this veterinarian since I moved to the area a few years ago. A couple if weeks ago I took in two of my dogs to be treated. I was told that I was being given 3 ml of a medication that I would give to one if my dogs twice a day in .12 ml doses. I was told this should last me about a month. I used the syringe that was given to me by the dr. and gave my dog exactly .12 ml twice a day as directed but the medication only lasted a week. I returned a check up call from the office today and let them know that I was not given as much medication as I was advised I was getting and that it only lasted a week. The person I spoke to left a message for someone to call me back. I did get a call back from Kate with a voice mail while I was at work. In the message Kate stated that the dr wanted to see my dog again and that I should have been giving my dog .12 ml, the meds should have lasted much more than a week, and that I over medicated my dog. I called the office and asked to speak to Kate. I told her that I medicated my dog exactly as instructed and that I have her .12 ml twice a day. She insisted that I was given 3ml of medication and that had I correctly medicated my dog it would have lasted longer. She refused to admit or entertain the idea that someone on their end may have made a mistake when measuring the medication that was give to me. After a lengthy argument in which she did nothing but insist that the error was in my dosing and not in their dispensing and a very insincere apology I hung up. So I have now paid 300.00 for a vet visit, which included medication that was not dispensed to me, and my dog still has the same issue she was seen for AND I am looking for a new office to take my dogs to so I can pay someone else to see my dog for the same issue that should have been resolved with our 300.00 visit to Paws. I will be visiting the office tomorrow to speak to the dr. And request a partial refund for the medication since I paid for more than I was given as well as to pick up my pet's records.

Possibly the best Mexican food in the valley! I never would have thought to go there just from driving by but my husband was taken there by a friend and in turn took me there. It is now a favorite and regular spot for us. I have not had anything yet that was not completely delicious!

I cannot speak to the quality of Dr. Kidd herself because unfortunately I could not bring myself to go to her office after multiple negative experiences with Rita, a member of her office staff. I was referred to her office by my primary gyno to be scoped to check for endometriosis. When I called to schedule my appointment I spoke to Rita and told her that I was referred for a scope to check for endometriosis. She proceeded to ask me questions about different procedures using medical terminology that I don't understand as a layperson. I told her I am not a doctor and did not understand her questions and restated that I was refers for a scope to check for endometriosis. She said that she would need to get the notes from my primary's office before she could confirm which procedure I needed but put me on the books for a specific appointment time. It took two more phone conversations in which she always sounded too busy to be bothered with me to confirm that I was scheduled for an endometrial biopsy. Since I am not a dr I did not know that this does not involve a scope...so I googled the procedure and what I read sounded nothing like anything my primary had discussed with me at all. Honestly, I almost called my primary after the first two conversations with Rita to request a different referral...now I wish I had! After reading about the biopsy procedure I called my primary's office and spoke to a member of her office staff who pulled up the notes they sent over and read that it stated very clearly that I was being referred for a scope. She also informed me that the biopsy is not even something that they would refer me out for because they do them in their own office. She called Dr. Kidd's office for me and when she called me back let me know that they had changed my appointment to a consult. I called Dr Kidd's office myself to find out why I had to have a consult if I was referred by a dr that I had already consulted with. Rita explained that this is required since Dr Kidd has never seen me before. I was trying to explain that these appointments are not easy or convenient for me and to inquire as to whether an exception could be made. As with our previous three conversations Rita was in no way interested in hearing anything I needed to say. I asked her to let me speak but she refused because apparently she already knew everything I was going to say. I tried to point out to her that she was constantly interrupting and talking over me. I finally got her to be quiet long enough for me to bring to her attention the first time we spoke when she refused to listen to me resulting in her scheduling me for the wrong procedure. Of course, she didn't want to hear it so she said she would let me speak to her manager but not until she gave her HER side of the story first. Her manager came to the phone and immediately assumed that she knew what I was going to say based on what Rita had told her so she jumped right in with, "to answer your question" at which time I stopped her and let her know that the conversation was not going to go that way and that she should not be assuming to know what I wanted to say or talk about. Her response was that she already knew what my question was and could just answer it. I told her I did not have a question and expressed some frustration to which she told me I needed to calm down. I told her that I was calm and that she should not be assuming to know what I was going to say. So, finally, I was allowed to speak. I recounted the four conversations I had with Rita. She apologized and then continued to "answer my question" letting me know that the dr requires a consult with all new patients before performing any procedures. So essentially she didn't really care about the way I had been treated and was just waiting to answer the question that I no longer had. I cancelled the appointment for the consult and will calling my primary for a new referral. I sincerely hope that Rita receives some coaching regarding communicating with patients. Although I doubt she will since her "manager" wasn't a whole lot better.
