The sushi rolls are subpar and the the service has a lot of (bad) attitude (other than the sushi bat guys who are fast and friendly). The staff at the front try hard to make you feel unwelcome and act like they are doing you a favor seating you. They carding policy is ridiculous. I know it's college town and everything but when you are in your 40s and they won't bring you a beer on a Saturday night because one of the two has forgotten their license, it is time to say bye bye. Which we did. Happy hour at the sushi bar is still ok in a pinch.

Went there tonight for the first time. Really good experience overall. Great upbeat vibe with cool music, beautiful men and women. The sushi was very goo, the infused sake was too. Service was prompt and kind and happy hour prices quite reasonable.

WAY OVERPRICED!!! How can you serve average comfort food and charge $20-30 for main courses? The wine glasses are microscopic. The food is fine but honesty it does not warrant the money you get charged. Service is attentive but kitchen is very slow.

The food was absolutely delightful and our server and the sommelier were very good too. However, the hostess girl was absolutely clueless and if it had been up to her, we'd never know what this place was like.   I called the restaurant from down the street to make a reservation and she put me on hold for a long time. called back and she offered a reservation for over two hours later, which i refused. her English and interaction were awkward so figured i'd give it a try anyway. When we arrived we were surprised the place was filled to about half capacity and she had at least 5 tables for 2 open. still she was indecisive and started saying "i have a couple seeing options for you...". We picked one, she recanted, and had a seat at the bar while she "figured it out". when I got her attention again she finally gave us a different table that the one she offered originally. she blamed it on not being able to read her own handwriting (yes, really). truly clueless. can't believe this woman is still working here or anywhere else. Still, the place is good. Go.

I have only tried appetizers and thai tea here but everything I ordered was good. The restaurant has a large dining room and the service is attentive and very friendly.

Just left after giving the Gladly's my second chance (about a year after my first visit there). My first impressions were 100% confirmed. Heavy, oversalted, somewhat unsophisticated and over-portioned food. The chef is gadding too much sauce on everything & pork and chocolate everywhere they do not belong. We ordered 3 different entries and none of us liked ours very much. The appetizers and service were good. The dessert menu was very underwhelming. So far a 3 start review. But for $50 a person all of the above is way overpriced thus a 1 star deduction.  We won't be coming back.
