Absolutely beautiful. We actually were lucky enough that we went on a partly cloudy day and it was absolutely gorgeous. The chihuly sculptures are so intricate that just seeing photos of them does not do them justice. There was a lot of walking involved, but it was such a nice day that it made it easier to appreciate the beauty and serenity and not focus on armpit sweat. Excited to go back one of these days.

I have been going to this place for over ten years. Great food, super super wide variety of entrees. Oh, and excellent bloody marys. The north scottsdle location always looks like a scene out of "florida retirees monthly" so if you are a bit younger I would suggest the tempe or PV locations. Besides that, real tasty. Give the chicken salad sandwich mile high a try.

it's wal-mart. What kind of review are people really looking for here? It's cheap, but their practices as a company are negatively impacting every other retail and pharmacy business in america. Is it worth it to get 75 cents off your paper towels?

Absolutely terrible. I highly discourage others from living here. The front office staff is completely inept. Multiple times thy have delivered packages of mine (fedex or ups takes them to the office at times) to different tenant's apartments. A few of those times the package had already been opened. They constantly harangue you for violating their rules (we were forced to take down tactfully decorated curtains from our balcony...god forbid we have some privacy.) We have gotten notices that our trash service will be discontinued because we put the trash out at 5 pm and it should only be out starting at 6 pm. And what do we get for all this harassment? a patch of disgusting, west nile infested grass in brown patches in front of our apartment, broken lamps that aren't fixed for months at a time, an almost complete disappearance of guest parking spots so that our guests can go park in what is the equivalent of tucson and make their way through the maze to our apartment, and a monthly water fee....WHAT APARTMENT COMPLEX CHARGES ITS RESIDENTS FOR WATER?!! Especially one that charges so freaking much for everything. The majority of the time if I make a service request, the technician or whoever is sent will have a bad attitude and be completely rude. I offer these guys water an food for their time and I am only constantly met with a shitty  attitude...get over it guy, its your job, they pay you to do that. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Stay away.

I've been coming to this place for years and no matter how many sandwich shops pop up in the valley, I still always say that convenient corner makes the best sandwiches I have had. The boar's head meat is fantastic, the bread is delicious, everyone who works here is so incredibly friendly, and it's tucked away in a neighborhood so you don't get the annoying foot traffic or loud morons talking on their cell phones. Just an excellent sandwich. I'll be singing this place's praises for years to come.

This place is the shit. The absolute shit. The sandwiches are piled high with meat and fresh veggies, the pastry goods are delicious (the effing cannolis are so damn good) and holy cow, in the winter no place has better soup than DJ's. The baked potato soup and italian wedding soups will remind you of your first orgasm. I cannot understand how you could not rate this place high, I have only had excellent experiences here, no hygiene issues, only friendliness and great food. The abundance of girls under the age of 18 is slightly unnerving but to each their own I guess.

Walking around this area with a friend and she suggested we stop here for lunch. I can see why they have been in business for so long. Food was excellent. Interior is nice and cozy. I had combo a (taco, tortilla crisp, enchilada) and everything was so tasty. The guac was also super tasty. Not the best mexican food I have had in the valley, but it is up there. Will be back

trendy but the food is great and the staff is incredibly nice, don't not go because of the old town stigma. There is a loooong looong wait for breakfast on the weekends but definitely try it at least once because it is well worth it.

On the very short list of enjoyable old town bars, it's ramped but it reminds me of a college town bar. Good music, bartenders are awesome, cool shit hung around the place, stiff drinks, you should see their holiday display during december! so cool looking. Keep it up guys

This is where I go when I am feeling like a country breakfast. Quaint little place inside a post office/convenience store. Tons of old 40's and 50's memoribilia all over the place (think route 66 signs and gas pumps) Great service, tasty drinks, and mmmmmmm that country gravy. When the weather is nice it is also beautiful in the courtyard outside for a lazy weekend breakfast. I will always love this place.

I've been coming to this establishment since it was on mountain view and via linda and called 'Wine and Kebab' and it is absolutely delicious. Nasser (the owner)and his staff keep a very high standard for food and service. I have been here hundreds of times and the few minuscule times that any mistakes happen, they correct it immediately and apologize. Excellent food, nice cozy ambiance, very authentically persian.

You can't go wrong here at all. Everything is so delicious. Just try some of their sandwiches with freshly sliced meat and you will realize what you have been missing out on your whole life from other sandwich shops. The pasta: delicious. The pastries?! Fuhgeddabowd it! Not much to not like here (location is kind of in a crappy area but who cares too much when the food is this tasty) There is a bit of a crowd during the lunch hour, but you would be hard pressed to find a better italian market like this in south scottsdale. Try it at least once folks.

just took my lady here for valentines day. Man you do not expect a place like this so close to the grunge that is ASU. Little area of paradise. The restaurant is surrounded by grass and trees, it is extremely cozy, especially if sitting out on the patio (which you should always do when the weather is this beautiful) Our waitress was amazing. She gave us excellent wine recommendations that complemented our meals exquisitely, and she also threw in a lesson about gin and tequila, thanks!! I got the duck breast which was perfectly tender and succulent, my girlfriend got the lamb shank which was equally tender and flavorful. Yes it is expensive, but what do you expect? I can't rate it 5 stars because I feel that they are not doing anything different than any other high end fancy restaurant, but that should not deter you from stopping by, fr the ambiance alone. Thanks guys for making our valentines day great.

This is the only restaurant that my work has used in the past 6 months that has gotten our order 100% correct every single time. Extremely reliable, friendly competent staff, and awesome food. You guys rock so hard! I love that they check every piece of food with the food ticket when doing take-out orders, you guys should teach classes on that! Keep it up, you have a loyal customer out of me.

Been here many times, and also just had our work holiday party here. Classy establishment, excellent food, and nice wines. I love the patio, it's nice and doesn't even seem like you are in AZ anymore. Only knock on this place is that the waiter thought he had free reign during our holiday party and kept refilling our wine like he was replenishing water. Endless wine with no idea how many you have had? You can derive your own results for how that nigh ended up for a few people.

I have been coming here for years since my ASU days. Whatcan you say? The food is amazingly fresh and flavorful, the pastries are...I don't even have words to describe it, just salivating noises. Caramel cream macaroon? It's like your first orgasm. Drinks are awesome too. Keep up the good work guys. Never bland or boring here.

This is a great place with a very cozy interior that will remind you of your own living room. Couches line the inside with assorted tables and chairs, and the patio is nice and open to a quiet courtyard which is not too exposed to the sun. The wine flights are tasty and well priced and the service is excellent. The only things preventing them from getting 5 stars from me is that the menu can be expanded a little bit in my opinion and also it seems every time we go there it always take so long to get service, sometimes even on nights when they are empty. Besides that, fantastic place to go with some friends for a casual night out

Awesome experience. I had driven by many times but never ventured into this joint and I can see what the hype is all about. The location itself is absolutely gorgeous; massive trees in the back patio area where families were sitting under enjoying the shade. Beautiful garden area also in the back. The food itself was just as advertised; fresh, delicious, and huuuge quantities. I had the chicken sandwich and there is no comparison to free range non hormone ingested chicken. The flavor was great, it was grilled perfectly to juicy, succulent bliss. Be warned, the portions are pretty large. The onion rings were a meal unto themselves. Do yourself a favor and get some fresh pink lemonade here. My only knock is how friggin' pricey it is ($20.00 for a chicken sandwich, lemonade, and a side of onion rings?!) but besides that everything wan fantastic. Employees are also just as nice and helpful as can be. I will be back many times.

happened to be scoping out some dr's offices for my job in this area and stopped by this little place. The area first off is absolutely beautiful. It's in this fantastically gorgeous spot in gilbert surrounded by lots of greenery; trees, grass, flowers, all things that arizonans are not usually accustomed to. First impressions were that this place was slammed. Inside was rocking and it was a friday morning. Wide drink selection, good (not great) food. I had a supreme breakfast burrito. It wasn't the best, lacked some flavor, but the portion was huge and kept me satisfied. I sat in some cool upholstered chairs and just took in the ambience. Lots of students, but you see a lot of young families in there also. The place looks like it is being run by teenagers and the nicki minaj with +7 bass that popped on the stereo at 9 am confirmed that fact. Real cool place to hang out and get some work done. Will be back.

My work has used this little joint a few times for small lunches. Sandwiches are truly fantastic. Very authentic Italian, both the food and atmosphere. Sandwiches are very tasty, albeit a bit greasy, but it's italian, what do you expect? Salads are fresh, pastries are delicious, and the pizza (made only twice weekly i think) is divine. Thanks guys!

This brewery is pretty fun. Typically a great atmosphere filled with good people and staff. Drinks are tasty and varied, food is ok, not a home run but its not bad. I must warn though, the bloody mary is so-so and a bit disappointing, but besides that you will enjoy yourself here.

Came here about two months back with my girlfriend during a date night. This place is meant for foodies. The mushroom and rice appetizer is out of this world delicious and anything with fish is just so fantastic and fresh. Not to mention there wide array of sake. I had some sort of spicy jalapeno sake beverage that really complimented our meal. I ended up ordering the halibut and it was one of the best prepared halibut dishes I have had in this state (I am from seattle so I am picky with my fish.) The atmosphere is very nice as is the decoration inside. The service was equally excellent as all our servers were extremely personable.This place is pricey so be forewarned. My only gripe is that for such expensive prices, the portions are quite small. A trend I really hate with gourmet food. Will definitely be back.

Delicious. Soft but crispy pitas, extremely fresh veggies, excellently seasoned meat. I had a chicken souvlaki pita and seasoned fries and they really hit the spot. Wish this place was closer to home, but I am in the area often and will continue visiting here.

Why doesn't this place have a higher rating?? The fish and chips here are so delicious. This is how fish and chips is supposed to taste like. This place delivers consistently on quality and flavor. Sure, it's probably not great for you but who the eff cares when it tastes this good. I am from Seattle originally and this is the only place in the valley that satisfies that greasy delicious fish craving I get. Don't forget to try their other english food (the bangers and mash are also bomb) and look through some of their english food and treats that you can buy for home. Keep it up!

I don't quite know how to feel about ling & louies. On the one hand, the entree's themselves aren't spectacular or revolutionary, but the food is all cooked to near perfection. I would figure a place in North Scottsdale would be a bit more adventurous with their menu; but don't let this deter you from coming. The staff is very friendly and it does not feel canned. We had fun joking around with our waiter the most recent time. THe outside patio, despite facing a parking lot, is still nicely designed and can't be beat on a nice night in the valley. The food is very very tasty. I had the jewelled beef most recently and the meat was perfect and flavorful. My girlfriend for the ahi tacos (nothing like going for asian cusine and coming out of it with tacos) which were also awesome. Mongolian beef flat bread appetizer should be a must for everyone. My only gripes really are the lack of innovative plates and also wish they had more than 6 beers on draught. Regardless, at the very least you should just come for the experience of opening the massive front door...it's a blast. Thanks guys

I know nothing about women's fashion. Let me reiterate that statement, I know nothing about fashion. The majority of my life I have dressed as if I were a 45 year old man. So when I decided that I wanted to buy my girlfriend some cute trendy clothing, well, I was way in over my head. Turns out I don't even know what most female clothing is called. But, after a friend recommended Pitaya I made the trek and I was instantly happy with my decision. I was greeted with smiles, then pity as I described my severe ineptitude towards fashion. The sales associate (I think actually she was the manager because the other girls kept coming up to her and asking questions) metaphorically took me by the hand and after I showed her some pictures of my girlfriend, put together some cool little ensembles that she thought would look good on her. turns out my girlfriend loved them. And, even better it ran me less than a hundred bucks for two full outfits. Thanks for a painless experience guys!

meh. Pizza is mostly bland, very cardboard taste. Delivery times takes almost two hours. My order has been wrong all three times I have used them. Staff on the phone are always distracted when I call and unprofessional, maybe the reason why my order is always wrong. When I brought up that my order was wrong with the manager once, she put a credit on file for me. When I went to redeem the credit, it turns out it was credit for ONE ingredient only. Boy, thanks. I mean, the pizza you got wrong was unedible because of a food allergy and was $22.00, but thanks for giving me credit for $1.85 towards my next purchase (where you forgot to include an additional order of garlic knots.) *sigh* Wings aren't great either by the way. I was excited to move to an area where I would have a local pizza joint down the road but Lorenzos has horribly disappointed and underwhelmed me. Will not be getting any more of my business, sorry.

For living in arizona, it's really tough to find some decent, authentic mexican food in the north scottsdale locale thus when I tried this play for the first time I was blown away. The blackened chicken is so moist and delicious, the carne asada is flavorful, and the best part of all, there is no need to run directly to the restroom after eating. BAM! This place has just been marked as my go to mexican food in the valley. Keep it up guys.

How do I say "keep shoving meat into my mouth hole" in Brazilian without it seeming like some sort of lewd innuendo? How can anyone not enjoy it here. Sure it's expensive, what do you expect with a never ending delivery and variety of perfectly seasoned meats. Not only that, for those meat connoisseur, you can even choose what part of the specific meat you would like to eat. And then let me drop this bomb on you. BACON. WRAPPED. FILET. As much as you can possibly put inside your body. A tip don't bother with the salad bar. Rookie mistake. Keep that gullet free and clear for only a meat landing. Yes. Forever yes. x1000. Marry me? No, be cool, we can only be friends with benefits Fogo....my girlfriend would never understand.

I've tried the cakes before but this week was the first time I actually ordered one and I was not disappointed. Chocolate chocolate chip with the delicious frosting and a bow in the middle for our boss's birthday. The website would not let me order any earlier than 2pm but I needed it by 1130am so I called them up and their super friendly and helpful sales associate walked me through the order and told me it was no problem at all to have the cake ready by 1130. Everything was perfect when I went to pick up and I even got to try a sample of another flavored cake. This place is great ad everyone should give them a try if you haven't already.

Stopped by for a quick work lunch. I love the atmosphere, feels like a true sports bar. I got the  spicy texas burger and it was great, cooked well, full of flavor, and a perfect size. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. The only reason it's not five stars for me is because a 5 star place has to blow me away. everything was great here, definitely better quality than most sports bars, bu nothing that blew me away; AND THAT'S OK! Give this place a try, I find it hard to believe that anyone can eat here and not enjoy it. Thanks guy.

Fantastic food here. Its a real outside-the-box kind of place with very different breakfast menu. Different is delicious here. Seriously...try the waffle dogs. Why haven't you tried them yet......I'll wait. Only knocks against this place (which at this point are what I call first world problems, as they are not real issues): Seating is cramped both inside and out, and being right next to the ice den, this place has lots of people around. Inside, outside. Not a cozy little nook, if that is what you're after, but the food will win you over.

So much hype that i had to finally give it a go. I went with the meatball sub and added jalapenos. MMMM. Very tasty. Much more flavorful then somewhere like subway, or even capriottis. Bread was awesome, and the cherry limeade machine is a godsend. Definitely will have to be back. Not too pricey either.

When I walked in, I thought "whoa, I am not cool enough to be in this place" However, turns out being 'cool' is associated with standing around conversing with one another and friends instead of focusing on making coffee..10 minutes to make a vanilla latte with only one person ahead of me. I figured it'd be the best damn vanilla latte I have ever had. It was not. Cool little place to hang out and chat or get work done, but the service and drinks leaves something to be desired. I'll give it another shot and update my review if necessary.

This is the best Mexican food ever. Holy moly. Like, not even a competition after I ate here. The food is unbelievable, authentic, and delicious. The location is a bit sketch, but don't let that deter you! Nice and modern on the inside, and can we talk horchata? We should talk horchata. fresh strawberries IN THE HORCHATA. It was like experiencing your first orgasm. You guys are amazing, keep it up, I will for sure be back many many times.

This is me and my girlfriend's go to wine bar. Tried them out for the first time a few years ago and it's hard not to go back. The daily wine specials are great, the live music they have is awesome, the whole music theme itself is very refreshing for a wine bar, and the food is good also. My only gripes are the food menu could be expanded a little and the last few times we have gone there have been some incredibly loud drunk women at the bar talking and joking with the bartender and it seemed everyone around us (including us) were getting really annoyed. Not appropriate behavior for a wine bar, maybe a sports bar. Otherwise this place is great! I highly suggest coming during dusk and sitting on the patio while the sun goes down, beautiful! Keep up the good work guys!

I just moved right up the street from JJ's and had a few friends rave about t so I had to give it a chance and wow! Fantastic. From the friendliness of the entire staff (including the owner) to the delicious food (the chicken salad: perfection) to the ambiance of the deli itself with its sport's memorabilia littered about, this place is truly a hidden gem as everyone is saying. I can't wait for Sunday to roll out of bed and grab some JJ's! Thanks guys!

Yes. Yes this place is fantastic as most of these reviews say. Holy cow, I have been jaded by sandwich and sub places the past few years because for the most part every freakin' sandwich is made the same way. Even those claiming 'originality' stole their idea off someone. But I gotta say, this place had a different presentation, and not only that, the flavor, the price. All awesome. I had the spicy italian (which hwas recommended the most) and it did not disappoint. I added jalapenos and got it hot and it was presented open faced. Melted cheese, delicious flavors, veggies and bread weren't soggy. And a 10' delicious sandwich and drink for less than $10.00?! Oh man, I am in this area a lot for work so I will be stopping by again for sure. Thanks guys, you were great.

I love this place. Very nice and open with large windows facing a beautiful rock canyon and golf course in fountain hills. Service was fantastic, as was the food. I had the filet, girlfriend had the duck. You can get good steak many places, but good duck is hard to find and it was absolutely delicious here. Melted in your mouth. Will be back for sure

Not the worst, but not the best given the prices. Stopped for lunch. The fish and chips were ok, the cod was a little too greasy and the breading would slide right off. Fries were also over cooked. I must say the atmosphere is great, however. And the entire staff is super super friendly (that bumps them up 1 star) I will definitely come back because of the service alone. Just going to have to try something different.

Nice little neighborhood breakfast joint off via de ventura in scottsdale. They do have lunch also (suggestion: southwest veggie wrap with grilled chicken!) As far as breakfast goes, big portions, and very very fresh veggies and fruits. It gets packed in there though so get there early.

My favorite Thai food in the valley. Always prompt service, in the hundreds of visits I have made here, they have never once made a mistake in any order I have gotten. The pad thai is so freaking delicious, and gotta get it 3 times thai hot! Everyone who works here is so nice and funny. I remember around the holidays hearing one of their employees singing christmas carols and it was adorable. Try this place if you want some delicious, authentic thai. Keep up the good work guys!

So I live in Scottsdale but I was out in these here parts for work and it happened to be lunch time, so checking my hand dany yelp revealed to me this little hidden gem. I am middle eastern and was raised by a mother who cooked three delicious, lavish meals every single day for us kids so I am very very picky when it comes to middle eastern cuisine, and I am happy to announce this place blew me away. I went with the 2 meat combo (#7) and oh man. The Lentil soup was delicious and insanely flavorful. The kebab meat? perfectly seasoned and tender, most places over tenderize which leads to stringy meat and chemical taste, but not here. The chicken kebab? My entire life, the thousands and thousands of chicken kebab I have enjoyed, this place was the second best (sorry guys, my pops still makes it the best, but I am biased) Excellently grilled and seasoned. The rice was delicious and reminiscent of persian rice with a raw egg stirred in. I wish I lived closer, but I will definitely be back. I can see why this place is ranked top 10 of all restaurants in the valley. Thanks guys!

everytime I have gone here the staff has messed up our orders. One day it was so bad I called and the manager offered us a completely free order, which was awesome. She totally followed through on that thus the 2nd star, but that order was also screwed up. Nice people but that doesn't cut it when people pay you for food. Might need some re-training here

Terrible terrible terrible. Delivery has taken over an hour the last three times we have ordered from them and we are not even 1/2 a mile away. On top of that our order is wrong every single time. One time they said they ran out of bread and it took the delivery driver over an hour to go down the street and get more (this according to their driver) The most recent time it was because "the manager chris is incompetent" according to their employees. Nice and dysfunctional. At the very least follow through on the company business model of "freaky fast deliveries" but they're not even able to get that right. This location is garbage, stay away.

They provide exactly what they say, cold beer and cheeseburgers. The variety of cheeseburgers is refreshing and a nice chage from the same ol' same ol'. I had the o-lineman which is a cheese stuffed patty sandwiched between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. Despite the threat of a sever colon backup, I went ahead and ate that beast and it was glorious. The burger itself aside, the grilled cheese was fantastic on its own. What prevents them from getting that 5th star is that the patty itself was a little tough and wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected a sit down cheeseburger place to have, but don't let that deter you. Good ambience, good food. Go for it. Last point: tots are insanely delicious here. Get them. Hey. You. Get the tots.

Was looking for a close by breakfast joint and stumbled upon this little gem. I don't know why I had low expectations but they really came through. Service was fantastic, our very enthusiastic waitress gave us high fives after our order....apparently she was very encouraged about the process. But she was a delight! I had the country fried steak with green pork chili and rosemary potatoes. SO tasty. I also had to have the jalapeno infused bloody mary and the jalapeno bacon. For those spice connoisseurs: get these things. The bacon was unlike any bacon I have ever tried before. I didn't even think it was possible for bacon to get any better than it already is. This place nails it. Also the bloody mary was one of the best I have had in the alley. Excellently made and garnished. Hats off. The meal was a little pricey for 2 people but the portions are big so it's justified. Will definitely be back, thanks guys!

Boring, boring, boring. This bar is boring. I get it, the women are dressed skimpy and I know that's the selling point, but the problem here is that the hostesses who are dressed very skimpy cannot be over the age of 18 which makes me super uncomfortable, the waitresses have a tendency to all congregate around certain tables (maybe the owener's table I don't know) and just hang out there which leads to me not getting my beer or service for long periods at a time, there is nothing to do inside this place. No pool, darts, shuffleboard, just tvs and boobs. The decor inside is cool due to the cabin theme but besides that I don't see many redeeming qualities. Just not my cup of tea I guess.

I eat here at least once a week, the selection isn't huge but the food is always delicious. Can't go wrong with a large carne asada burrito. Staff is always very friendly and helpful. Great spot. My only gripe is I wish they had a larger selection of salsa. Nothing is spicy enough!

Huge selection. This is where I go to spoil my pups. Lots of toys, outfits, bowls, leashes, collars, and tasty tasty unique treats.....I mean tasty for the dogs...not me, despite how delicious some of those canned steak meals look on the label. The staff is super friendly all the time also. It's not cheap, but nothing for your pets ever will be, especially not in north scottsdale, so that excuse can't really be used. This place is great though!

For being an old town bar, i find this place to be one of the least douchey. Atmosphere is cool, beers are tasty, staff is well versed on draft selection and make excellent recommendations for the amateur palate. Bartender also had a pretty sweet beard, so they got that going for them. Good job guys! Will be back

Went here to watch football with some friends and they were very accommodating for our antics. Lots of space in the back and fun games to play. The food was tasty and the drinks were cold. If you're looking for a super social location, this is not the place. It was pretty dead considering it was a football Sunday with the cardinals playing, but a good low key place to go with friends if you want to be able to actually hear them when they talk.

nothing spectacular, but you can't take away from the fact that they have good food. Location kind of sucks, but you can't win them all

friendly staff, excellent food. I had the capicola and jalapeno pizza and a pretzel appetizer. Draft selection is a little narrow which prevents 5 stars, but still very good beer regardless. I will definitely be back.

Very very small and tucked away but big flavors here. I had the chicken schwarma plate and the meat was marinated excellently and was cooked to perfection. I also had a side of the isreali salad (as us persians call it, shirazi salad) and it was also very fresh and well made. My only gripe was how pricey this was. My chicken schwarma plate with a drink and a side ran me $15.00. That is a pricey lunch. tl;dr: friendly staff, tasty food, $$ meal.

After years of going to the most montonous, bland eye Dr (think Ben Stein in wonder years) I decided to give Dr Mcmullen a shot after a friend referred me and all I can say is WOW! This guy and his entire staff are awesome. Breanna, Amanda, and Michelle are the sweetest girls and totally on top of their game. Check in was quick and easy. Dr Mcmullen himself is awesome. Very personable and humorous, but let's not forget to mention knowledgeable about his craft. I have terrible eye sight and have been accustomed to wearing contacts that make it feel like hedgehogs are making love to my eyes, but the doc ordered me these amazing lightweight contacts that i barely feel. Not only did they improve my vision but my eyes breathe so much better now; thanks Doc! He has some really cool equipment and the office itself is beautiful and easy to find. I highly, highly, highly recommend this place to anyone who wants their providers to care about their health as much as they personally do. This guy will be my eye dr for life, he's stuck with me.

This is my go to sushi joint. You could come here for lunch and be in and out and fully satiated in 30 minutes. Sushi is good, not great, but you are getting what you pay for (and you will be shocked every time at how much food you get for so little) The seating is a little cramped and the interior could use a definite design overhaul (large square room, awkward decorations) and I shuld probably mention how strange the music selection is for a north scottsdale sushi spot (oh...cool, a Bieber club song....and now pitbull....*rolls eyes*) Also, it takes forever to get your bill sometimes so make sure you are flagging down your waitress. besides that, delish. Try it out, especially if you have never tried the conveyor belt model before.

There was so much hype about this place that the bar was set super high, but my first visit was terrible. Had never been here before so my girlfriend and I were standing beyond where the line was looking at the menu. An 'usher', or whatever they are, jettisoned us (rather rudely also I must say) into the line saying we have to get in line, despite our remarks that we had never been here and didnt know what to order. He insisted so we got in line and within 30 seconds were pushed to the counter. We still had almost no time to look at the menu and we let the employee know that we were pushed through and we weren't ready and then he got frustrated with us. Felt like I was in the twilight zone. Hot dogs are sub-par and disappointing. Luke's of chicago was way better in my opinion. Not allowed to sit at a table and wait unless you have food, must clean up your own plates and throw everything away your self. Not really much a restaurant format. Wonder exactly what I am paying for here; average food and attitude it seems. Gave them 2 more tries and results were similar. Not coming back here.

This place is fantastic. The fish is so incredibly fresh relative to other sushi joints around the valley who lie in the same price range. Service was very quick, staff was friendly, and my yelp check in got us free edamame which was also very fresh and delicious. Will have to come back, thanks guy!

Delicious. I have been looking for a good fish taco place for years. As a Seattle native, I am picky, and getting fish at restaurants in a land locked state always gives me the heebies unless I go to a 5 star restaurant. This little joint opened up right down the road from my house and lemme tell you, so worth it. First off, the gentleman working behind the counter was awesome. Seriously, this guy loves his job and it is so apparent. He asked if it was my first time then went through all the ingredients in their tacos, what makes them special, and recommendations. Didn't even sound canned, just authentic. I ended up getting the fish tacos (two tacos, so massive) and the seafood chowder. Both unbelievably delicious. Coconuts gets this pacific northwesterner's stamp of approval. I am a customer for life, thanks guys for such a great experience.

Holy cow this place was so bomb. First off, everyone needs to get the almond horchata. I don't trust a person who tries the joyride horchata and doesn't like it. The tacos are unbelievably tasty. Literally, doesn't matter which one you get. Orgasm in your mouth. Make sure you get the habanero salsa also if you are a spicy fan. It does spicy salsa justice, and then some. Can't wait to come down and get more tacos!!

Tasty ice cream and treats and close to home! I like the fact that they are not just another yogurt place but offer both frozen yogurt and ice cream (bc yogurt is too healthy to be a dessert #fatlife) Also I have to givve a shout out to the younger male emoloyee with the long hair. Its really hard to find people in the service industry (in scottdale0 who are passionate about their jobs but you could tell this kid loves what he was doing, he was a hard worker, and had a great personality. Keep it up bud! If anyone is in the area, definitely stop by this place.

I would eat here 2 times a week if I could (and didn't mind becoming obese) Burgers are amazing here. They are always cooked to juicy perfection. The greek burger is so damn good it'll make you wanna move to greece. Truffle fries are your sexy little delicious friends. The shakes will leave you disenchanted with shakes from anywhere else. Even the soda fountain offers up non-conventional sodas. Always busy so if you're looking for a quiet night you won't find it here, but great social place to eat some gourmet burgers. I highly recommend.

Got this yelp deal for my girlfriend's iphone 4s. She had a cracked screen (again...*sigh*) We went in, the tech was super friendly and helpful. Everything was very simple, told us it could take up to 30 minutes, we went next door to barros for a slice and a beer and 20 minutes later as we were wrapping I get a call that the screen was already done. Excellent screen, not one of those cheap ones that smears easily. They did a great job, will definitely use again when she inevitably finds another unique way to crack her screen.

I have been here twice so far and with more visits I will potentially alter my review, but as of now this place is pretty great. I'm not on the gluten free bandwagon (oh so for thousands of years humans were fine but all of a sudden everyone gets a bit farty when they have a bagel...yeah you totally have a disease...*sigh*) butttt, for being gluten free you can hardly tell because unlike other gluten free options in this world (gluten free bread! gluten free cereal! gluten free water!?!) jewel's baked goods have FLAVOR! Cupcakes are bomb. Macaroons, you ask? Bomb diggity. Bread? Yes. Apparently they make their own flour and there is the secret. As a marketing manager, I will be using these guys often to win over clients. Looking forward to more tasty treats, thanks guys

super interesting concept, very tasty food. Subway of pizza, but much nicer. Think more chipotle (but without the rectal bleeding.) The crust was crispy and delicious, I loaded the pizza itself up with a load of shit that probably doesn't go together but is delectable in my mouth. If I remember correctly I only paid around 10$ and still had 2 slices left over for dinner. Staff was very friendly in explaining how it worked to me because I walked in and just did the thing where you stare at the menu with your mouth open, unable to decipher it.  Will be back for sure.

pretty sweet place from what I remember.....whether it was the excess tequila or the place itself, I do remember having a great time. Lots to do (pop-a-shot, bags, darts, etc..) lots of space, good drinks, friendly staff. Will be back for another night to not remember.

After hearing about these guys from a friend I called up and spoke to the owner Aaron directly. He was very very knowledgeable and friendly and laid out the exact plan to help me out with some water damage I had in my house due to some leaks. I don't know when the last time I called a company and was able to speak directly to the owner. Furthermore, I don't think I have spoken to any business owner who was so with it and engaging. Within a day their technicians (who were very professional)  came out and cleaned up all the damage and everything is now looking like new again. I can't thank these guys enough. Best part was, it was extremely affordable and they stand by their work. Thanks again Aaron and co. for helping me restore my house!

Oh man, this place is both of the bee's knees. I walked in as a naive gringo and the delightful woman working behind the counter saw my deer in headlights gaze and walked me down yum city. She gave me samples of all the meats, explaining the differences between them. Then once I had sufficiently stuffed myself on sample sized meats, i chose three meats for three tacos and sat underneath the watchful eye of captain luchadore as I had a foodgasm. Absolutely unmatched mexican food. The meat was seasoned perfect. Absolutely perfect. The staff was so friendly, the atmosphere so unique, the food so delicious. I will be taking all my friends here. Thank you!!

I gotta admit, Its nice having somewhere fun to go to on those nights when you just don't wanna do the same old bar scene anymore. You can only play big buck hunter so many times before you want to smash the screen in with that plastic gun. I'll get you one day you big buck....ahem...but I digress....The golfing games are very fun and even those who have never golfed in their lives would be welcomed here. Great spot to just hang out for a few hours and hvae some drinks with friends while making a fool out of yourself. You can either really impress your friends or completely leave them in stitches all based off your golf swing. Keep that in mind fellas if you are bringing a girl you want to impress. Drinks are strong, food is good, atmosphere is nice. Lost a star because of long long lines and a little bit of incompetence encountered with concierge, but besides that cool spot.

I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time as I am a big fan of the Sam Fox restaurants, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed with all facets of our food and experience. First off, service took so incredibly long. Yes, they were busy. But if you have a busy restaurant, you hire more staff, you don't let the customer service suffer. My margarita I ordered was terrible. It tasted like someone just mixed some sort of minute maid juice with too much tequila. Got loaded fries as an appetizer and they tasted like they were frozen fries, whether they are or not I don't know, but to have the taste and texture of frozen fries is not ideal for a plate of 7$ fries. I ordered an el diablo burger; there was absolutely 0 flavor in the meat patty. Tender? Yes. Juicy? Yes. flavor? none whatsoever. I can make tender meat all day long, but if it has no flavor then what is the point; especially when you're paying as much as you do for a gourmet burger. It didn't even have any sort of grilled flavor. I will give them one more try, you can't fully judge a place with one visit and if I find it to be better I will update this, but I must say it was an extremely disappointing visit.

Awesome awesome food. Probably the best gyro meat I have tried in the valley, and the firefighter pita will surely satisfy spice-o-philes such as myself...mmm. Chicken gyros are just as delicious. My coworkers and I eat here at least once a week. Keep it up!

Excellent food, great atmosphere (every vig location is unique in its design), interesting drinks. I like it. Drinks took forever to come to our table, however. Also, don't necessarily trust the wait staff's recommendations on drinks. I think one of my chromosomes flipped with a super sweet drink they suggested. Don't worry, I watched a ton of sports and popped that sucker back into 'Y' status though. Try the mac and cheese!

Just got done eating here. It's one of the newer chipotle type pizza concept restaurants. Pick you're pizza size, add as many toppings as you want for no extra charge, wait 7-8 minutes, and bam, there shalt be pizza. it was pretty tasty. Veggies were fresh, staff was incredibly friendly, and pizza was ultimately very tasty. I can't say anything knocked my socks off; it's going to take something amazing and innovative in the pizza game for anyone to be really impressed these days, but it was very convenient and delicious. Well worth a try.

Pretty darn good. Went here for a pre-laser tag lunch and beer. First off, the server had an excellently groomed 'tache. Nice 'tache bro. Very nice staff who engaged my friends and I in conversation many times. Great beer recommendations. We all ended up getting the burger and beer special for the day. Burger was delicious, grilled excellent with thousand island and jalapenos. Mmmm mmmm. We went on a sunday and there was barely anyone in there (which is probably to be expected on a sunday) but it filled up fairly quickly around 1pm. The location is a bit obscure inside the shopping strip, its tucked away behind a wal-mart, but when in Mesa I will definitely be back, thanks guys.

As always, Postinos never disappoints. Went for brunch on Sunday to this location and it was our first time here. Our waitress was so friendly, sweet, and personable. The patio outside is very relaxed and with the college atmosphere around it was a great place to just lounge. I ordered a pitcher of good hefeweizen and it was only 5$, had the B.E.L.T. sandwich was absolutely delicious and also low priced, This might have been my first postinos visit without bruschetta and I was still not disappointed. Awesome job guys.

Why doesn't this place have better reviews? What the fuck Scottsdale. People take themselves too seriously these days. That's why I am glad that there is a place for nerds and non-nerds alike to converge and consume large quantities of alcohol and nostalgia with the game room. TMNT arcade? yup. Blitz '99?! Girl you don't even have to ask. Wait...holy shit...wait....IS THAT REVOLUTION X WITH GUN CONTROLLERS IN THE CORNER?!!?!? Awesome awesome place. Good drinks. Fried pickles (which are my litmus test for bar food) are fantastically satiating when intoxicated. Will be back for many years to come.

oh my goodness. I pity those on diets and the health nuts for not experiencing this place. Mac and cheese stuffed burger? Pepperoni pizza stuffed burger? You kidding me bruh?! So freaking good. The staff was extremely friendly an patient with me also as I tried to decipher the menu and decide what I wanted. I only wish I lived closer. Way to go guys, this place is fantastic.

This needed to happen. Ever since Scottsdale shut down all of their fried chicken joints (albeit one kfc was left in old town) I have been high and dry on my greasy fried chicken fix. Who the hell doesn't like fried chicken? Really Scottsdale? Do I have to go to urban hip restaurants to get my expensive fried chicken fix these days? And those restaurants always have bone dry fried chicken, bland seasoning....blah. Snobs don't know what real fried chicken is and this place has it. Great chicken, great waffles, cool interior, and damn good gravy. Just a heads up, the kool-aid is approximately 74.3% sugar so it's nice and thick as it goes down....only knock I have is that it takes soooo long to get your food some days. And not just busy days. Last visit the restaurant was less than 1/4 full and still took 35 minutes to get my food. Otherwise keep it up!

I use this place a lot for my business as we cater lunches for doctor's offices and it seems Scottsdale doctors are all about it. Way overpriced first off. 7$ for a salad seems reasonable until you realize that's without meat. tack another 5-6$ on top for the meat. And for a place that touts healthy food, the sides are all chock full of sodium. I have never had saltier asparagus, and that was not a one time only experience. I have suffered through the salty asparagus at least 6 times now. Long lines and waits, staff is not necessarily the brightest or friendliest, and we have had multiple catering orders not prepared correctly. Also once the staff gave us grief about ordering the food on the phone 3 hours in advance for 10 people saying it was not enough time. 3 hours is not enough time? Wow. This place is the flavor of the month for Scottsdale. People go for the name, but the food is not worth it. A shame as Sam Fox restaurants are typically spot on. If I can avoid coming here I will.

I tried them for the first time yesterday. Today I went back and ordered 4 dozen cupcakes. They are that good. The staff is beyond friendly and wonderful, the cupcakes themselves are moist, delicious, and the best part is they are not 90% frosting but still tast awesome. Additionally, if you have not tried their homemade ice cream, good god give it a chance. It is what dreams are made of. I am a marketer and have been looking for a great cupcake place nearby as everywhere else is overly sweet and frosted. This place is around the corner from my work and perfect, they have a customer for life and I will be telling every marketer and person I know to come here. Thanks for being fabulous ladies :-)
