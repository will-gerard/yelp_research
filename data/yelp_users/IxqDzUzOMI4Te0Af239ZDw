I drive a mini and usually go to the MINI dealership but couldn't get in and I REALLY needed an oil change. They said they had to check to see if they carried the correct oil filter before they would tell me that they could do the oil change. They checked on the computer but didn't think to check the physical inventory. So after I was given the green light and all the oil was drained out of my MINI....here comes the guy to tell me that the oil filter in stock is defective! He apologizes over and over and says that they are getting another one delivered from another store, but that they are backed up. So now what was to be a 10 minute oil change as the guy said....had now turned into over an hour oil change. To top things off...the oil filter that was delivered from the other store DIDN'T FIT!!! Granted the guy didn't charge me for the oil change, but if the customer service would have been a little more on point I wouldn't still have to go to the dealership for my oil filter!! No more Jiffy Lube for this girl!

Nice looking store, but not nearly enough staff for a Sunday!! No one greeted me and I had to stand in line as if I was ready to pay in order to get some assistance and they didn't carry the Zebra brand highlighter refills I was looking for...at least the guy didn't think so?!?! Not very knowledgeable staff!

Delicious food & great service!! They pay attention to detail...my boyfriends 2nd drink came to our table looking odd and the server noticed it didn't quite look like the first one and took it back to get it made right!! Even the hostess that sat us was very pleasant and asked us about our day and whether we would like a booth or a table! They have something for everyone here!

The Chompies @ PV Mall is the best! I always order take-out but the deli guys are the nicest, kindest, coolest dudes!!

There is nothing "new" worth seeing at The New Tropicana! Our room was on the first floor in the Bungalows...sounds fancy but we had a view of dirt! I requested a room with a bathtub, but the guy said some rooms have tubs and some don't but he assured me they all have showers! I said great, and toilets too?!?! So no shower...we dealt and went out gambling the night away. We returned to our room around 2am hoping to get a few hours of shut eye, but instead we got to hear every waking moment of our neighbors sexcapades and television viewing...the walls in this place at PAPER THIN!!! The neighbors weren't even screaming or moaning...it was just your typical flirty pillow talk! This is NOT a 4 star hotel by any means especially since when we complained about the noise and smoke smell in the room all they offered to do was move us to a smoking room! WTF??? We asked to speak to a manager but no one was available! Horrible customer service! Not worth it!!

I wanted to try one of the adult coffees I had heard about on the radio. When I asked the server for the drink list she said we don't have that and all the Over Easy restaurants are individually owned. I asked what "brioche bread" was like and she was like "what?" I said "is it fluffy?" ...basically she was no help and we felt rushed to order, and rushed to leave. Not even did the hostesses welcome us even after I said we had never been there before, and even when we left...hostesses were silent! Except for the lady bussing our table, everyone else seemed unhappy. I even witnessed our waitress push another employee out of her way as they crossed paths...RUDE! The food was so so, but the experience left us feeling cheated. We definitely won't be back to this Over Easy!

I love the group fitness classes! I go 3x/week and have been amazed with my body's transformation. They even give great Nutrition advice. Everyone who works there and works out there is nice...it's a great little fitness community! You get what you give!!

Not worth all the hype. Good customer service, but selection is minimal and just ok tasting. ..nothing to write home about.

Very clean facility! The front desk lady was super nice as was the X-ray technician. Unfortunately all the great customer service stopped as soon as P.A. Randall Sorrentino came in the room. My boyfriend, who never complains of pain, was experiencing back pain and this guy came in like a robot with his questions and didn't seem to have any compassion for the pain he was in. My boyfriend specifically told him he has previously been prescribed Flexorall and it wasn't helpful with the pain, so what did Randall prescribe...Flexorall!! He then went on to tell him to do some neck/back stretches but never gave him any examples that would help stretch the specific area of pain. Everyone but Randall was nice and compassionate. Randall needs to work on his active listening skills and bedside manner!

This was our first time using the Parking Spot 2! We had excellent service from calling on the phone to inquire about how it works all the way through picking our Cadillac back up and exiting! The shuttle was very clean and comfortable, the drivers were very nice, and the cashiers were very knowledgable and friendly when we asked about the reward program! It took no time at all for the shuttle to pick us up after we got our bags from baggage claim! We don't fly much, but we will definitely use the Parking Spot 2 again and will recommend it to others!

The midtown location continues to disappoint with their lack of customer service! We sat for 15 minutes waiting for a server and when she arrived she was not at all apologetic. In fact she asked if we needed more time when we hadn't even gotten water!! Then the food took forever...how long does it take to cook 2 eggs over easy!!  Last time I'm coming here!!
