5 stars, nuff said! Just check this place out. Food and customer service was top notch. They're still taking people in and accepting new orders 5 mins till closing. Owner was so nice that he gave us free green tea ice cream for coming in. Sushi rolls looked and tasted fresh. Definitely coming back and supporting this local hub

Yelp really needs to add a 0 star. Their food is garbage. I guess it's a good thing their servings are small which is why I did not feel guilty throwing the rest of it away.
