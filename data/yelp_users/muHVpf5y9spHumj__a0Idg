This place is TERRIFIC!  I have been several times with my family and they've got something for EVERYONE!!  Their salads are yummy as well as all of their appetizers and sandwiches/burgers.  Their wings are hands-down the biggest and best in the East Valley!  Our favorite are the Sweet Chili wings.  Sweet & Spicy all at once! The outdoor patio with its comfortable seating and fireplace is such a great addition, along with the live music. And if you wanna watch a game, this is definitely the place to be!  TVs everywhere!  And if you're lucky enough to sneak into one of their booths, you get your OWN TV! The wait staff is always friendly and attentive, and the prices are fair.

We just left this place and I can only say it was very disappointing.  Saturday early evening dinner service (4:30pm).  Upon sitting, our VERY aloof waitress sulked over to get our drink order.  No greeting. No "Hi my name is...".  What she DID do was tell us she'd come back when we ALL figured out what we wanted to drink because she didn't want to make 5 trips.  Ummm...honey...it's your JOB!   After a bit, she brought our drinks with no conversation at all and left our table.  For a while.  Her whole attitude the entire night was like it was beneath her to wait on us.  (I think someone else mentioned this in a review, so we must've had the same girl.). The food was just okay.  Nothing spectacular.  On one of her few trips to our table, my father-in-law mentioned to her that it was our anniversary.  No "happy anniversary".  Nothing.  She just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off.   Very disappointed.

Our favorite restaurant of all time!  We've been to Roy's all over the country, and the Chandler location is the one we frequent most. The food is ALWAYS delicious (butterfish is a MUST HAVE), and the service is always attentive and top-notch.  If you want an especially great experience, ask to sit in Tim's section.  He's a wonderful waiter!!

We ordered take-out here recently.  3 entrees and chicken lettuce wraps.  Right after we got home, I got a phone call from the manager asking me to check my order. Unfortunately, we had ordered Kung Pao shrimp but were given Kung Pao Chicken instead.  The manager asked if we wanted to come back for the correct item.  It was pouring down rain, so we said we'd just eat the chicken.  The manager apologized multiple times, offered to refund us the money for the incorrect item, AND sent me a gift card for $10 a few days later!  Wow!!! I was super-impressed by the level of customer service and willingness to correct a small mistake (the first one we've experienced at this location).   As always, the food was Delish! Thank you, Pei Wei!

OHMYGOODNESS!!!  I LOVE YO LOVE! This place has the BEST frozen yogurt I have ever had.  The flavors are so true and original.  They use all natural ingredients. My favorite flavors to date are peanut butter and oatmeal cookie.  I could eat Oatmeal Cookie every day, it's SO good!  And the selection of toppings is wide. On average, my family and/or I go about 3x per week.  It's my daughter's favorite after-school snack!

This place is SOOO good!  I love their Mediterranean salad with Gyro meat.  The salad alone is delish even without the dressing, But the light dressing tops it off.  The gyro meat here is so tender and flavorful and their pitas are fluffy.

This was our 2nd time coming to Barrelhouse.  First time was about a year ago, shortly after they opened (not a great experience).  This time wasn't great either.  It's Restaurant Week and they've only got ONE server on the floor!  Completely irresponsible!  We ordered a few small plates and a bottle of Chardonnay.  They were out of the wine we initially ordered, along with two other items on the menu.  It took 15 minutes to receive our wine, even though there were only a couple other tables at the time.  We had to ask for a wine chiller.....THREE times before they brought one to our table.  The owner seemed uninterested in helping the ONE server serve her tables, which by the time we left was about 10 tables. On to our order - BBQ chips, mussels and short rib small plates.  We asked about the soup of the day and was told it wasn't ready yet.  "Maybe" it would be ready during our stay.  (This was 6:15pm, by the way). The chips are WAY over seasoned and the dip was hard.  The mussels were luke-warm and didn't have much flavor.  The short rib had good flavor, but was barely cold.  Such a disappointment.  We will NOT be back.

Soooo yummy!  This pizZa is delicious if you like thin crust pizza!  You can customize it anyway you like!  Everyone was SO friendly.  Clearly we're not the only ones who love it... The place was packed on a Saturday night!  I only dinged one star because the Chardonnay was "meh".  Otherwise, we are fans and will def be back!!

We were the only people in there today.  Building interior is lovely. Our waitress was nice enough and attentive.  Food came out very quick, but our egg rolls were cold and they only give one piece of lettuce for two egg rolls.  We sent them back and asked for hot egg rolls. Shortly after our pho came out.  It was just okay.  Nothing to get excited about.  Then the fresh, hot egg rolls came out and they were bland. With so many other options for pho nearby, we will choose one of our other favorites next time.
