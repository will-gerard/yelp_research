A couple months ago, I had to see an ENT and I had called around to a couple of offices and was very pleased right off the bat by the friendliness and sincere concern offered by the staff at Entegrity over the phone. They were able to fit me in the next morning, which was fantastic!  Once I was checked in and all my new patient paperwork was filled out (very quick process) I had virtually no wait time before Dr Bailey came in. Again, he showed sincere concern for how I was feeling and offered several options to ensure that the treatment fit my needs.  I've had to see him again for a separate issue and the staff at Entegrity as well as Dr Bailey were consistent with their amazing care.

I love Red Lobster's endless shrimp and delicious biscuits however, I'm sitting here writing this review at my table because I've been here for an hour and a half so far and have yet to get my food! Drink refills are impossible to obtain because our server can't figure it out. In fact, he disappears for 20 minutes at a time without resurfacing from behind the kitchen doors. I couldn't even leave if I wanted to because I can't get my check! I'll update my review with food reviews if our food ever arrives...

Overall, the work performed was stellar and the price I paid is very competitive. I have upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4 now that the work is done but I am still hot over the lack of communication.   My first review outlines my experience starting with the quote on Thursday 4/24 (that I wanted to accept for the Friday availability I was offered) to Monday 4/28 when they actually removed the trees but not the stumps.  The workers who removed the trees said someone else would be coming with the stump grinder but the stumps were still there when I got home from work on Monday; they were still there on Tuesday too. So I called Jeremy to see what was going on, and again I left a voicemail. Once again I was not given the courtesy of a call back. I decided to wait for someone to call me for payment so I could ask them to finish the job before I gave them my credit card info since I expected that would be the only way to get their attention. Money talks.  Finally, a week after the trees were removed (10 days after they originally said the job could be done), I came home on Monday 5/5 to a yard free of stumps! I was very impressed with the care they took to protect our vehicle and how well they cleaned up after themselves.   I got a call from accounts receivable (Jason?) the next morning and he said he had been notified the work was completed and he mentioned their stump grinder had broken down and they had to wait for parts. It would have been nice if someone had called me to update me on this when the grinder broke or even when I called confused as to what was going on. He asked if I'd like a bill mailed to me or if I'd like to pay over the phone. I was ready to be done with this project sooner than later so I whipped out my card and paid over the phone which was quite convenient.  Perhaps they should upgrade their business phones so they can see they have a new voicemail... Until then, expect fantastic workmanship with spotty communication.

The employees at this location are extremely friendly. Only complaint I have is that they have some trouble keeping up with the high volume as far as cleanliness in the dining area. But all in all, we're pleased and continue to return when we're on the go.

It really is the little things that make an experience special. The team if attendants who wheeled out my MIL to our car were so super nice and one even helped her put on her seat belt. It made my heart melt that they were so thoughtful!

This place has the best orange chicken in AZ! I moved to Glendale 2 years ago and this place is still worth the 100 mile round trip drive, even with gas prices on the rise! I hope they grow big enough to expand to the west side.

I absolutely love this place! I've never had anything but spectacular customer service and they have so many yummy and guilt free choices that we make this a monthly treat (sometimes twice) for the whole family.

I dropped my iPhone 5 on my lunch break yesterday and of course my luck of no damage finally ran out and my screen shattered into a million pieces. I quickly slapped a piece of packing tape on it so I wouldn't slice my fingers open trying to use it and glass wouldn't fall out everywhere. A little panicked, I scheduled an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar to get it fixed that night. They told me the screen couldn't be replaced and since I was out of my warranty, I had to replace the whole phone to a tune of $269+tax. I thanked them for their time and started my Yelp search for another less expensive option immediately.  It was late when I found iPro iPhone Repair last night so I waited and called them on my lunch break today at work. Mike answered immediately and when I told him my woes he assured me that he should be able to fix it and said he could come out and take a look at the damage after his next appointment. He gave me pricing options over the phone and had me text him my details to make things simple. He even kept me in the loop about when he headed my way and when he was close by! And sure enough he was there before we closed for the day and got to work on my phone right away while I continued working which was amazing because we were super busy. (God bless my boss for letting me take care of this at work!)  Mike finished up so quick that I couldn't believe he hadn't just swapped it out for a new phone! I should have asked him for a stack of his business cards because I had to write down his info for 3 different people at my office when they saw how easy and quick the service was!
