Stopped in before a doctors visit and was very pleased. Victor is the new owner and he seems to be doing a wonderful job. I had a ham and green chile burrito that was delicious and was very affordable. Thanks for the wonderful food.

I had flowers sent to my wife and she loved them.  They were beautiful, fresh, and smelled amazing.  I had to change the address where I originally wanted them sent and they were very accommodating.  Great service and great arrangement.

What happened to customer service these days.  Here is what I have purchased  over the past couple years; 4 Iphones, 2 Mac Mini's (one tonight), 2 ipads and 2 Macbooks.  Anyways, my MacBook power cord has been faulty for several months now, it is only out of warranty by 5-6 months and this store wouldn't help at all, not even the manager.  I understand that they can't give everything away for free when something breaks or goes wrong but If I was the manager of this store or if this was my own business, I would make a CUSTOMER SERVICE judgment call and help a very loyal customer out.  I am a newer customer who has been adding more and more Apple products routinely over the past 2 years as noted above, I am NOT a customer with a 5 year old MacBook with a 5 year old faulty cord.  The worst part is that the first person I spoke with was quite aware of the issue that I was having, seemed like it was a very common problem.  Just frustrating that I spoke to the manager of the store and he refused to do anything.  Let me reiterate that I was literally paying for a new Mac Mini as I was having this conversation with the manager.  Kind of annoying that a company that prides itself so highly on having a Superior product cant even keep their $80 power cords working.  I don't think that in all of my years on this planet I have had a power cord break on any of the hundreds of devices I have owned until I got an overpriced Apple power cord.  I would be rating this experience 1 star but the salesman (unfortunately I can't remember his name) was very nice and helpful so I wanted to give him his credit.

Breakfast was great, quick and the establishment is very clean.  Price is a little high but definitely worth it.

I had a haircut with Nicole today and it went perfect!!!  I have had long hair for some time now and was a little nervous but she listened to what I wanted and did a wonderful job.  Price is fair for the type of service and expertise that you get.  Thanks Flict and especially Nicole.

Great company because I feel as if they really cared about my system and my return business.  It is nice to see that there are companies out there that plan on having you as a customer for life and don't look at you as a quick buck.  Customer service is hard to come by these days but Dukes of Air excel at it.  Thanks for your quality work, you have my business!!!
