Hands down one of the worst Chipotle restaurants I've ever been to. They have 7 people working... no line, and I've waited for 15 minutes already for a side of fruit for a kid's meal. Really? The employees need to stop having their little side conversations and take care of business. I'm by no means against having fun while you work, but this is insane.

I love the Blooze! Thursday rockabilly nights are awesome! There's a great checkered dance floor to dance the night away! The owner is the nicest guy you will ever meet. There's hardly ever a cover and drinks are cheap! If you're looking for fun on a budget, this is the place!   P.s. If you sit at one of the tables check out the awesome pictures on them! My favorite is the prohibition table.  P.p.s. Girls... You have to look in the bathroom... There's pictures of hunky guys on the inside of the stalls... There's even pictures of Tumbleweed (the owner)!

Doctors may be good... But the service is horrible. I've had to wait 30 minutes everytime... Regardless of having to make an appointment.... Poorly run doctor's office. Ive never had to deal with this kind of wait anywhere... Definately switching practices immediately...

Amazing authentic vietnamese food. Not to mention it's very cheap! Love it! I recommend the Pho... Delicious! It reminds me of the little restaurants that dot the streets in Vietnam.

Came here tonight hoping to have the great food that I remembered from years ago. My parents used to take me here and it was delicious. What happened?  I got the combination dinner of lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, and chicken parmesean. They pass this platter off for 14.95. The chicken tastes like it is frozen... I couldn't take more than  two bites of it. The tomato sauce is overly sweet and basically flavorless. The fettuccine alfredo.. The sauce was bland... thin enough to not be clinging to the noodles... The lasagna.... The only thing that had any flavor was the ricotta...   Now for the service.  Bad. The server that wasn't even ours basically threw the menu on the table without looking, hitting my fiance in the arm with it then came back with a second menu and plopped that carelessly down next to me.  We're both pretty indecisive,  so it did take us a bit to order. The server was very ingenuine, and it was obvious. Having been in the food service industry for almost 10 years, I know when someone just wishes you weren't there because they want to go home. After our salads were brought out then taken away in haste by the other server, we were brought our meals.... without the server noticing we needed silverware, which we couldn't find our server for. .. we ended up taking some off of another table. (The salad came with a fork on the plate) Our server asked once if we were okay and hurried away quickly almost as soon as she asked. Came back once more where my fiance was finally able to ask for parmesean. The server left our table to hopefully grab it,  but instead went immediately to another table to help them, grabbed take out boxes, went to help another table,  then finally grabbed the parmesean.  I get it. We're not a large party. We don't look like we have a lot of money... buy I tip darn well when I get good service.  Needless to say... I will not be returning... ever.

Torta is amazing! Quaint location that you'd miss if you weren't looking. I used to drive past it all the time and didn't know it was there until I was looking up places to east on Yelp! Really fresh ingredients! Wish they weren't out of the blood orange lemonade, but the acai lemonade was really good too!

Only reason why this is even a 2 is because I have eaten here before and the food is great.   I have never had service like this before here...  Started off normally. Greeted at the door, seated... The restaurant was a little busy at a little before 10. We got drinks within a couple minutes of being seated... French press was delicious... and then the waiting... 5 minutes... 10 minutes... 15... I'm about done watching others get seated and orders taken... I watch the waitress put in orders... talk to the other staff... not even a look over to out table... Got up and left... Not what I expect from Postinos... I won't be returning to the central location again...

I love the ambiance in this little cafe! I felt like I had stepped back in time or atleast that time slowed down a little bit. Everything was fresh and delicious! I had my favorite breakfast of country fried steak. OMG the gravy was amazing! My husband had the pork chops and eggs... They eeeeee juicy and it was a huuuge portion! This place is so good for the price... I'll definately be going back! I can see why it was packed on a Sunday morning!

Can't get enough of the boba! So good! Definitely take the time to sit and have some delicious vegetarian food here. You'll love it! Or if that's not your thing... Da Vang is in the same plaza!

The old time ambiance is great in here! I love the creative names of the good on the menu..so cute. The Phantom of The Opera was my favorite so far. It's a chicken sandwich... You'll have to go try it for yourself. The best night to go is a night you wouldn't think of going out, Monday. They have the Savoy Night Swing Dance that night. I've posted an event for the next Monday night. It's $8... Which includes an east coast swing lesson and free dance...plus they keep the happy hour specials on all night.

I love the pizzas here. The crust is positively delicious! I never get that nasty crash I do from other pizzas. The Superbiotic on skinny crust is my favorite! The staff here is always friendly and they have me coming back atleast 2-3 times a week! I've had delivery too and they're always prompt! Like they say when they answer the phone, "It's a great day to get Naked!"

Love the food here, but I just came by at 6:30 on a Friday to get some food and they're closed... nothing posted on the door that they would be closed during this time... super disappointed. Please update your hours of operation if you're going to be closed. That's just bad business.

Talk about amazing... I can't say enough good about The Stand. I've been here several times, and the staff is always so bright, happy, and passionate about their food. My favorite thing is the Mexican Corn... I have an obsession with it. It's perfect in every way with the onions, cilantro, cheese, mayo, lime deliciousness! My only wish is that it wasn't seasonal. ;) Everything is made fresh, which does mean a wait sometimes, especially when it's busy... but I tell you, you won't be disappointed if you've got the time! I also recommend the banana shake, and this coming from someone who hates bananas... It's delicious, creamy, and entirely refreshing! Burgers are flavorful and delicious... Fries delicious and also flavorful... The best horchata I've had in town, perfect balance of sugar and cinnamon. YUM!... Next on my list is the salted dulce de leche shake.  Oh, and GET THE STAND SAUCE!

Great mover! Speedy and efficient. I needed to move a large futon from a friend's 2nd floor apartment to my home. Jason did such a great job getting it into my spare bedroom, which doesn't have the easiest of angles to get anything into. I would most definitely use Master Moving again.

I went in on Thursday evening with a friend, since I was excited about the place... We got a bunch of food (a pound of crawfish, a pound of king crab, and a 1/2 pound of shrimp, with some extra sausage, potato and corn)... The service was HORRIBLE! I've never seen such a disorganized restaurant! We were sat outside, right by the door, where their 'hostess stand' was... We ordered drinks from one girl... Then she came back to check on us, but we hadn't decided yet... We decided, then had to wait about 5 minutes before another gal came out and took our order... Then about 5 minutes after that, another server came out and asked if we had put in our order... Ok, cool. One part of our food comes out, we start eating... then the next, which was crab legs, but no cracker for them... We got one of them (a different one, again) and asked them for one. They said that they were being washed and it would be just a minute (ok, cool... they should be back in a minute or two with them)... 5 minutes pass, and we ask another one for the crackers so we can eat the crab before it's cold and get the same story (being washed, be just a minute). I KNOW for a fact... it does not take that long to use the automatic washer or a 3 compartment sink to wash those damn things.... THIRD time to ask for them, SAME RESPONSE! Are you kidding me??? Finally we get it and then we get the last part of our meal, the shrimp... Then finally after that the cracker for the crab comes by... And yes, by then... it's luke warm. Considering that was the most expensive part of the meal (and only 2 crab legs for 24.99), I was unhappy... We got checked on, I think once after that... that's fine, I don't really like being pestered while I'm eating. Now, the check... We had to FIND someone to get us our check... then, once we gave the payment... We waited about 5 minutes, wondering where the change was... Then we asked someone, they asked someone else, and then that person came out and asked who we gave it to.... Ummm? You lost our money? Really.... Finally they come back with the change. Whew! We get up to leave and much quicker than anything that happened that night, the first gal that served us was out there grabbing the folder with tip... she OPENED it too look at the tip and scowled... now, that, my friends is UNPROFESSIONAL. We left $10 on a $50 bill... Had I been the one leaving the tip, it would have been less, but my friend is much nicer than me. Get your stuff together. Now food wise, delicious... Crawfish were a bit over cooked, but good nonetheless... We had those in the hot n juicy sauce, mild. King Crab, probably would have been better if we could have eaten it while it was actually hot... We had that in the Juicy Cajun, Spicy. The shrimp were in Garlic Butter, mild... That sauce was tasteless, it was watery, and not buttery at all. Very disappointed on that to say the least. The shrimp were cooked decently though and when dipped into the other sauces, at least got some better flavor.
