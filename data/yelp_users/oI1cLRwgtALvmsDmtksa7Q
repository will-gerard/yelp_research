Ordered pizza from here tonight and decided to call after an hour and a half had passed by.  The girl on the phone was rude and said the pizza was already out for delivery (we live 4 minutes away) then proceeded to hang up on us mid-sentence.  We called back ten minutes later after the food had still not arrived and talked to the same girl who proceeded to put us on hold for 3 minutes.  She said she would cancel and refund the order.  I then asked nicely, "no apology or anything?" to which she responded saying oh yeah, I'm sorry but it wasn't my fault.  Not sure how the food is, but the service is lackluster.

Word to the wise..don't come here if you're in a hurry on the way to work. Drive thru took over 20 minutes making me late for work. Third time I have been to this location and the drink was made incorrectly 2 out of the 3 times. Make the drive to a different location!

Hot and ready?!  HA. Every time I go here they tell me it will be 8 minutes before anything is ready. What a joke.

Food. Was. Amazing. Finally found incredible seafood in Phoenix. Oysters were fresh and tasted great, calamari was crisp and perfectly cooked, the sushi roll was on par with the best of them and the chocolate cake was decadent! I will definitely return here and highly recommend others to check out this restaurant.  Lastly, the service was exceptional!
