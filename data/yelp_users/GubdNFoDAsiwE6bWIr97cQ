When I have a friend or relative visit from non southwest places they all want to come here and they all love it.   It is set very nicely with good displays and explains a lot of what one might not know.  The gift shop too is a nice stop before we continue on our day.

I go here at least once every two years whether I want too or not. It usually is not, but I go.   Today was one of those days.  We arrived probably around 1:20 p.m. and the lunch rush was over; if it had one.  The young lady took the name and said it will be about ten minutes, ok no big deal. This gave me time to look around again for the first time. The building and the décor is tired and uninviting. It could be really nice if it tried.  Ok so this is not fine dining I know that, I accept this.  Our server was Cory; he did a fine job with a very pleasant attitude.   I ordered what was recommended to me by two folks; the Mizithra Cheese and Brown Butter. It is said to be a toothsome treat for cheese lovers. What in Gods name does that mean I have no idea? Nor do I know why a cheese lover would love this dish. I also ordered a salad and cup of soup. Clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name. I beg, please do not give me a wet salad, dry the veggies first and then serve them. As for the toothsome treat it self, well no. Bruce looked over and said; man that looks dry is it missing something? I would not know since I have never had it before, but I do know if this is a favourite dish of anyone they have very low standards in food.  I like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this. Find inspiration and pass it along to your patrons. I mean if I am going to remain fat I want it to mean something.....

I have had food form this restaurant a few times over an extended period of time. I have never eaten at Zoe's it was always take out and I did not do the picking up of the food. So no comment on the structure or service. It is not horrible, but also not quite good either. Very uninspired in all foods I have tasted. Sorta like eating dry white bread. We ordered as a group each time I ate, so I just figured it won't kill me so why not. Really a lousy reason to spend too much money for bland, but there you go.

A friend and I stopped here today for lunch. I for some reason thought it was an odd choice, but he seems to go often and enjoys it. In fact the woman taking the order said to him, no drive through today? It would looks as though he is known in the whataburger world.   The people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected. I ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. I opted for the Hi-C. I do not like sloppy food and this burger would not have been if the bun had held up. But as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place. The meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour. The onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy. I loved the Hi-C.   You know you just never know if you will like something until you try it. I tired it and that is enough. Nice friendly folks though. I do like friendly.

Nice little joint, nice little waiter, nice little waitress If only this were what we eat out for it would be a five star review.  But we do have to consider the food do we not?  Tomato soup with basil, good flavour but to course in texture.  Meat loaf with mashed potato and mushroom gravy, Sounded good, was not good. I suspect the gravy was not made with a roux for thickening, but corn startch. It had the look and taste of a liquid clear plastic. If the potatos were real they found a batch that did a good job of playing the part of a boxed flake. The meat loaf had no discerning quality at all, so who knows if it was meat or tofu.  The iced tea was in a nice slender glass, but the flavour was of a nice tinted water.   The cookie was very flavourful with a good amount of chips inside.   So to say I enjoyed the food would be an untruth. Yes I will go back to try something else, just nothing with a sauce or gravy on it.   I forgot I also got a side of beans. Again a very odd consistancy for the sauce in which they sat. Much too sugary with no other flavour.

I guess I am the only one who is not impressed.   About 40 years ago when my parents decided to torture us and move us to AZ our relatives took us here. Not much has changed. Not that it is a bad thing to remain the same.   We after going to see the Chihuly exhibit we decided to stop here for dinner.   The two women who greeted and served us were fine I guess. Timing when you put the order in to come out when salads are eaten would be nice, but what the hell.   Antipasto Salad .........................................................Small $7.95 Large $10.95  Artichoke hearts, fresh Roma tomatoes, pepperoncinis, black and green olives, provolone cheese, Genoa salami, red and green bell peppers, radishes and cappicola.   We ordered the large for four people. This salad was a joke, three small artichokes were found, less than one full sheet of cheap cheese and salami were used and no Roma tomatoes. perhaps a half of a radish was sliced in to it and a bunch of lettuce all for $10.95   Gus and I shared a medium: Red Devil Combo $17.70  Pepperoni, chunky sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers   The taste was OK I guess even though the onion was the part I would throw away. But the crust was like shoe leather. I have all my teeth and could not bite through it and the knife too had one hell of a time cutting it .   Our Friends ordered something else; what I do not know.   The prices here are much too high for the quality,

First off, this is not a china town as some keep trying to say and then act as if it were substandard. It is the Chinese Culture Center , big difference. And for what it is I enjoy stopping and checking out the various shops and restaurants along with the great grocery. As a whole I enjoy this place. This place that is not China Town.

This is the store we shopped when we lived up the street. I like the size of the store, unlike other stores this size such as Trader Joes which drives me crazy. I really liked the choice of veggies since there is nothing better than a good salad or side dish. The meat counter has a great selection of meats and fish along with a few products put together for you and just cook. If I could not find somethng they often would order it for me and that was wonderful. Good cheese selection too is great. One thnig I did not usually enjoy was the pastry, it looks great but little flavour. And as for the prepared food counter, I looked often and thought it looks great but never bought anything. I preferred to cook. But most of all this store is always so well kept and organized with very helpful employees.

Well it is the best. For me that is. It just came to me that I have never seen a male working here, do they? The women are very friendly and beyond patient, they have to be if you ever watched some people pick out a box of candy. I would be slapping them up against the wall. It is a nice open store with an abundance of product all of which I have eaten much too much over the years. I love the chocolate but I crave the peanut brittle it has to be taken away from me in order not to eat until I puke.

This is the store where your business can sign up for discounts, this I have always known. But the last time I was there they asked after I said we did not have the discount if I was a veteran. Wow discounts count whodathunk, cool . Peanut Brittle anyone?

everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karsh's. our intent is to buy bagels and we do, but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies. all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great. as for service, always with a smile and friendly attitude. we used to go here all the time when we lived on n. central, but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place. so please open one near us too.

We have eaten here several times and always happy with the food and service. The last time we went everything was off, very dry meat which has never happened before. SO this will not keep me away as it must have been an off day.

Just left here not fifteen minutes ago.  One table of ladies with one rude woman sat next to us. Not the restaurants fault, yet irritating that such people exist.  Lemonade to drink, just fine as is.  Brie Brulee 12  Quite uninspired in presentation and the brie was very ordinary, my friends Mer and Mike serve one of much higher quality.  French Dip Sandwich 12  This one was with salad. Another lackluster presentation, but that would have been ok if were good. It was not, or at least to me.  The beef was cut too thick and with it being too well done and the gristle made for a tough sandwich with little redeeming flavour. It was left half eaten  Chicken Cordon Blue 10  I did not eat this, but Brice told me it was ok if all you were expecting is a chicken and ham sandwich. He did finish.  We had mentioned we wanted to talk with someone about renting the extra room, or get a card. The wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out. We did sit a while after we were done; no one came out or was a card offered. But it might have been because I guess I caught her off guard earlier.   In the middle of eating our sandwiches she asked if everything tasted good. I said no, she looked at me as if she did not understand, so I repeated that I did not like my food. Talk about someone's face changing from a smile to a deer caught in the headlights, she stammered and said sorry then ran off. NO question of why I felt displeasure or any thought of remedy. It did give us a chuckle with such lack of attention. But what it also did was make us reconsider if we should even think about the room for a party.  So once again I am in the minority since no rave from me.  Oh yeah and we had to ask for forks. Hahhahhahhah oh well.......

It must be me or I just never order the right thing, not sure. Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere. But hey it might just be me since I am of the minority on this subject.

I really enjoy this place. It is usually busy but we still find a place to sit. I almost always order the NYer with pastrami on rye. Just too yummy. I have on occasion order other foods and yeah it is all good. One thing that does sort of freak me out is when I get in line and it is my turn to order the guy taking the order always alerts his co-workers to look at me and they mutter in Spanish quickly and then smile and go back to business. It has happened every time I have been to this or any other location. I know why they are looking but they are so blatant it is strange. Oh and yeah some white guys understand Spanish too.

I like Saks, always have. Shopped Saks as a kid, being an odd little kid who refused to go to school unless I was wearing a suit. I like the building, the feel is what I remember from my youth. The men's clothes are as Thomas said, very conservative. I would just say boring. But yet I enjoy looking at it all. I do not know if they still do or not; but we used to get diamond studded dog collars in the fine jewelry. Hmmm I wonder where those are.

Pottery Barn is a nice serene store. Kind helpful employees, but not intrusive. I enjoy walking through when at the Biltmore, Alas for me the merchandise is geared toward folks who have yet to develop a personal style. Very generic in design for the most part. So this might be why it is so serene, it does not excite my senses. They have nice usable products.

For a long time when my mate and I walked past the store he would mention he would like an IPOD. So being the perfect mate I bought him one for his birthday. He opens it and said, why did you buy this I would never use it. I will spare you the rest of the conversation. So I go back to the store with the product in hand. I tell them I want to return this, I tell them why. They seem totally dumbfounded and find it very hard to accept that I indeed did not want the product. SO they ask a million question all assuming I did something to the product and rendered it unusable. Any fool can see it never came out of the box. So I repeat why I am returning it. Finally they say ok and tell me there is a restocking fee. I say OK as I had read the receipt. He said wait a minute. So I wait and he returns with what I assume is the manager. He starts his bull crap and literally yells at me about the fee and said I am going to have to pay it. I respond that yes I know of the fee as I told Him, point at the other employee. I have no problem with that, never did, never said I did. They finally took it and credited my card minus the fee all while they snarled at me. I guess I will never find out if I like Apple products as nothing on Gods green earth will ever induce me to buy from such imbecilic company.

Yes the place is pretty but....  My sister gave me a visit for my birthday. I have mentioned a few times that I would like to try TCooks, is that the right name? Anyway she misunderstood me and reserved a room for me and my mate.  So we went, yeah it is pretty, the grounds are nice, the staff well ok I guess. They of course could not find the reservation even though my sister had already paid and I have the confirmation number. So we sat in the lobby area for a bout an hour and a half while they figured it out. Finally they sent us on to our room with a lead. He showed us the room and asked if we needed anything. Nope was our reply. The room was nice if one is in to the look, I guess many from the mid-west are. The room was small as was the bath. There was no space outside for sitting other than a chair next to the room beside us. Yes it was nice, but only to a point. That point dropped when I found out how much she paid for this room, I almost pooped my pants. I am accustomed to paying silly prices for rooms as I like nice. But my God my home is much nicer than this hotel and a whole lot more room. I have no idea what she was thinking, but I am happy she thought so much of me. So yeah if you are coming from an area where this look is not over done, it is a nice place to stay. But I would still be disappointed with the room considering the cost.

Pruitts is a pretty big place, you will never lack for a sales associate none the less. There is a huge array of furniture for the whole house; yet I have never found anything I would consider buying. This is not to say the furniture is bad, just not my taste. If this place does fall on your design map, it is a great place to get good deals.

Stop reviewing the airport, why? It seems you folks are confused, when one reviews the airport it is about the actual airport, not the performance of an airline.    We fly a lot and of course use this airport. It is a very nice looking airport with comfort in mind. It is easily navigated and it you are confused there is someone around willing to help. The parking is easy and getting here is easy. If it does take time to get ones bags it is not really an airport issue but the airline issue. The actual baggage claim area is well planned. I really think we have one of the better airports in the world. I am thinking of terminal 4 since most of our flights start and end here. I know we used the other gates, but can not really remember them.

I like our airport, I think it is pretty nice.   This is about security which I guess is a part of the airport.   It is getting tiring.   Old prune faced woman snarking at you, tiring.   Say you have an artificial leg, you get the honor of being pulled aside. OK fine check the leg, but for God sake what is with this wiping the hands down and then the leg. I never see anyone else getting there hands wiped. If you do not find a bomb attached to the leg, leave the hands alone and lets just get on with it.   Really gets tiring for a people who travel a lot.

Last week we had a flight from Heathrow to Phoenix with a flight to Reno, well we did not make the Reno flight so we needed a place to stay until the next available flight.  Checking the board at the airport of hotels we choose this one. We called made a reservation and they sent the shuttle to come and get us, it arrived with in ten minutes. The Paris shuttle could learn a thing or two from this place. The driver was friendly and drove in a safe manner.  When we arrived we were greeted nicely and checked in quickly.  The room was down the hall on the ground floor, the hall seemed a bit dingy so was surprised when we entered the room to find a nice large clean well appointed space. The beds were very soft almost bouncy. The shower flowed well with nice hot water. I could not get on to the wifi so that forced me to do what I should have been doing in the first place, sleep. We had requested a wake up call and a space on the shuttle for the next morning. Well we had awaken early and got ready to leave an hour before our planned departure.   Lets just say the night time desk crew is a bit cheerier than the morning. Although the shuttle driver was nice. We got to the airport easily.  The area this Best Western is located is not really where I would choose if it were an extended stay in Phoenix, but for the purpose we needed it did us well.

it is a place that everyone wants to like just because of its topography.Yes it is different from most here in AZ. Nice and peaceful. But I can find that in my back yard. I do not think the food is too spiffy. My sandwich bread was so hard it came close to cutting my gums and yes I do have healthy gums. The taste was of no particular flavour to the point that I can not remember what I ate. I get the feeling the customers are trying to hard too. This place is just not for me.

The last time my sister visited we decided we want to try a place we had never been. This fit the bill as we have never eaten anything in Buckeye. It has the small town feel to it and the folks serving you are friendly. I remember the food was quite good, but no idea of what I ate. It is a place we would stop in if ever we find ourselves in fabulous downtown Buckeye again.

We had an explorer. It was a vehicle we enjoyed. So when we heard that the Escape Hybrid was coming out we stopped by to get some information, they had none. So a few months later when it was announced it was going to be released we went down to buy one.They still had no information and were not taking orders. So a week later we called instead of going down to see if they had any information as we heard they were taking orders on the news. We were told to come on down to get on the list. We arrived and asked for the guy we spoke with. Now mind you this was ten minutes after the call, he had no idea what we were talking about. He had no list but said he would take our names. We gave them and never heard from him or anyone since. We have never gone back as we figured they just did not want our business and went and bought a different brand.

My father gave me a ring when I was in my early teens. It is a Claddagh made of gold. I needed a repair done on this ring and took it to Victor Jewelry. They told me how much it will cost and when I can pick it up. I picked it up and paid the cost quoted and found they had done a very good job, no noticeable sign of any work being done. Good work and a reasonable price works for me.

This is one of our restaurants in PebbleCreek. I really love the building in which it is located and the decor of the restaurant it self. The staff is consistently friendly. But the food is just lacking. I think I have had one good sandwich in the many times I have eaten here. And dinner is no better, just blah food and real poorly cooked vegetables.  Too bad too as I want to support our own, hell I am paying HOA fees to help support these amenities.

So some friends came over to trim our trees, they know what they are doing better than I. As usual with friends they do not want anything for doing. But we feel they should be rewarded in some way so we took them to lunch here Toscano's. Having been so disappointed by my adventure yesterday with ordering a French dip I was still wanting a good one. So today I repeated my order here and it came out as it should, sliced thin and against the grain with a deep rich beef flavour. I was so happy I did not have to bitch once again. As usual the service here is friendly and the atmosphere and view of the driving range is nice.

Many years ago when this chain opened it seemed very exotic, so many things one did not see often.  Things have evened out over the years where one can find most anything in a variety of stores, yet this store is still fun to shop in when out and about.  It is laid out well with prices that are not too out of line. Someone is there to see if they can help and will if you do and they will leave you alone if you don't.  If I am at a loss for finding a housewarming gift I can usually find something to add to the pile.  So it may not be as exotic as it once was, but it is still a good place to spend a little time and money.

Having visited this restaurant many times over the few years it has been here, I have always had a good experience. We are greeted with a feeling they really want you there and the wait persons are more the helpful and just friendly enough. No matter what I order it is always well done and satisfies.

God this place just boggles, you walk in to a store area filled with things no one could possibly want, but they do. That is the first boggle, on to boggle number two. The restaurant it self, it is outfitted like I guess you are at an indoor picnic. Boggle number three, the food. Well this place serves a variety of things one might want to eat if they had flavour, but everything tastes like it came from the same can. The final boggle, why is the place so crowded?

Our Pup Draffan has been having a variety of infections over an extended period of time now. It started with his ears and has progressed to his front paws and legs. We had been going to a vet here in Goodyear for quite some time but have become frustrated with the lack of positive progress. This infection is derived from yest so his diet has changed yet he is still suffering and licking himself raw.   So we decided to try another vet and saw Dr Megan Johnson. I of course have no idea what she is having us do for Draffan is going to work or not, time will tell. But we were very impressed with her manner and caring attitude toward Draffan. She took the time to actually inspect him. She did say that his skin feels like the beginnings of cushing disease, what is not good news as that is what his sister died from a year ago. Hoping her good intentions and caring manner translates to comfort for Draffan.

Arby's has to be worst of the worst of fast foods. The meat tastes unreal like it came from a polyester cow or something. I have yet to get anything at Arby's that I like. It is one of those places one goes with the crowd not because you want too.

This is a very basic Mexican restaurant in one of the oldest strip malls in Goodyear. We have been going here for about 7 years now. It is one of those places one goes when one thinks about it. The food is almost always good, but has missed its mark a few times. In this miss it is usually because the food is just not warm enough. But this is not the norm. Working here one earns the money and it is done with a smile and efficiency. SO if you are ever in the neighborhood give them a try.

A friend came over and decided to bring lunch with him. Five stars for his thoughtfulness.  He brought one of those box meals for me, why I do not know as it is too much food. All I can assume is he thought, well he is fat he can handle it.   I suspect the taco was supposed to be spicy since it has a dull red color shell, not spicy. The burrito and crunch thing and taco all tasted the same, no difference at all. It tasted like mush, squishy soft horrible texture. I do eat at taco bell every now and again, but get the simple taco because it is usually full of lettuce and tomato with little beef. But this meal was incredibly awful. But hey the orange drink was good. I forgot about the cinnamon thingies, they gaged me. Who eats these things?

Some times one just wants food so we go to Denny's. We never go with any expectations other than it is a Denny's So we get what we expect, simple food prepared in a simple way. Being greeted with a smile is what we get along with good quick service. The place is clean as well are the toilets. Some times the other customers are a hoot to watch, but usually just folks out for a bite.

Ok all I can ask is why do we keep going to this place. Ever since we built our home in Estrella we have been shopping here. That is about 7 years now and another home.   No matter what we have special ordered and delivered it has always had to be taken back because they deliver the wrong thing. I think I just told you all I am stupid.

I really do not like anything about this place. The inside of the building is depressing with horrible little tables and chairs. I do not even remember the folks working there so they must have been ok as they did not doing anything wrong. The food to me tastes like it comes out of a TV dinner, yet folks eat here and it stays open year after year so someone likes it.

I have mixed feelings about this place.  We contracted them to do our landscaping front and back. We had gotten about seven estimates from other companies. They came in the middle range at about 35 grand. We chose them because they would do all the work rather than we having to call a variety of companies to do electrical and plumbing and get the permits.  I knew exactly what we wanted and gave very specific instruction. I wanted specific trees and of course they claimed they could not locate what I wanted. Funny i could and told them where to get it. I also told them no pink oleander, so they bring six to plant. We also wanted a wall constructed that would look like the stone walls one would find along the roads of Ireland. So we get ten HUGE boulders plopped in our yard. In all of this time the guy who said he would be there to supervise never showed his face once. In fact I called him at least once a day some times more for three weeks straight and he never got back to me until I threatened him with making sure his company would be sanctioned by our landscaping approval board. He called and said I did not have to threaten him to get him to call. It took longer than had too to get things done and many redoes but we are happy for the most part with the finished product. All of which I plan to change soon ;-{)

Dinner with friends on a Monday night.  Greeted well and taken to a table we did not like so we were shown one we did, with no fuss.  The waiter was a smiling kind of guy with a voice that would do well on a Broadway stage. He by the way did a fine job in his waiterability.  All the food was presented well and tasted just as good.  A nice place for friends to have a decent meal while visiting with each other.

On one of our trips between Phoenix and Reno we stayed here. It would not have been the usual stop for us but we had business with in one block and figured why not.  We were very pleased with the hotel and casino. Reception was polite and had a room ready when we arrived The room it self was a decent size and decor. All areas were clean and comfortable.  I am one of those who dislike being presented with a resort fee. Everyone is doing it, but I still find it unacceptable. I use nothing that would fall under this fee as stated, so we are paying for what? But we got this room so unbelievably cheap It really did not matter.

I don't quilt but Gus does so I have been to many and I mean many quilt stores.  This store is nice and large with very good lighting. It felt clean and fresh with room to move.  There is a very good lick of fabric and well displayed with a lot of fat quarters too. There is also several displays of patterns done with well chosen fabrics.  The staff is helpful and friendly.  Nice store...

ahh well once again this is a place I go becasue others I am with suggest we go. Not once has anyone I have ever been with has ever had a good meal. This of course includes me. A lot of money for beyond bland. I will speak up if anyone ever trys to convince me to go again. I would rather Jack in the Box down the street. At least I can get yucky food for three dollars there.

We have been to the art museum many times over the years, it always gets better.  The current cowboy exhibit is as usual good, even though it is not my cup of tea. One good thing, I saw an artist name that I recognize as being on one of our pieces at home. The difference between ours and the pieces in the museum is ours has no cowboys in it, just animals. But we will have to investigate.   The exhibit we went to see for the most part was, Extending the Runway Tatiana Sorokko Style. It did not disappoint at all.  Of course we also enjoyed the rest of the exhibits and Phoenix should be very happy with this venue.

We went for our first trip this morning. When we drove by at about 9:45 a.m. it looked abandoned. So we were not sure if it was still operating. After waiting for a few minutes a few folks started arriving so we figured it will open soon. When it opened we were really surprised how many tables it held as it looks like it might fit three at best. Now mind you it is not huge, but larger than it looks. There were five of us and we fit well. We were greeted by a very nice young lady. In fact I would say this place has the cutest staff around. What I mean by that is they were all smiling friendly adorable folks. We ordered our food and were attended to for drinks. Very large mason jars are used for the drinks and filled to the top. The food came. Four of us chicken and waffles and one had the rice and gizzards with gravy. We all loved the chicken, very tasty and quite crispy. Three of us liked the waffles, I being the dissenter. There was nothing wrong with them, it is just personal taste. I did not like the cinnamon added. We all took a bite of the rice and gizzards. Really good flavour with wonderful gravy. A good time had by all.

What a wonderful building inside and out, a little difficult for some handicaps but manageable.  We had season tickets here as well as several other venues around town.  Most of the productions were pretty good and enjoyable. Some of the shows particularly one person shows the sound was not too good and hard to hear all that was going on. We did give up our tickets for a couple of reasons, one being the seats are just too close together, another was the folks sitting in front of us and to the right would never shut up and the guy behind me would fall asleep about fifteen minutes in and start snarking and snorting. Why do these folks waste the money and enjoyment of others acting like this? But the building remains a gem.

My review would be from 1973. Everyone was friendly and welcoming when one entered. I am amazed this place still exists. Don't gay bars die on a regular basis?

Several years agoI volunteered at the gay center which was located in the same strip mall. Even then being so close I rarely walked the few feet to eat here.  A friend, Greg loves this place so I have gone with him.  I find the decor and feel of the place, cold and uninviting. We have always gone in what would be considered off dining hours so there were often no one else in the place but our table. We were always greeted with enthusiasm, but this is because Greg has one of those personalities that screams friendly and he always gets it in return. So our service has always been spot on.  But the food lacked inspiration. I have never had a dish that would pull me back on my own. It was never terrible or inedible, just blah.  But Greg loves this place and so do others I see. I am just not one of them.

I had been once before today and on the journey I was charged twice for my meal. I alerted the person on the phone when I called ans they said it would be taken care of, it never was  But this after noon we the office went to say goodbye to an agent going on to another office. We had a few plates of assorted appetizers and of course chips. The chips were so very bland as was everything else, except for the corn tamale which was freakishly sweet. I think most of my office enjoyed. But who knows no one really said.  The wait persons are very attentive and nice.

We often eat at El Pollo Loco when we are at our home in Reno. I tired one here a little over a year ago and was very disappointed.   Well As I was traveling west on Indian School I noticed this store and said to my self, why not.   I ordered and received my order quickly, it was all done by a very pleasant young woman.   Got home, opened the package and found I actually got what I ordered.   Ate it. Liked it. So when in the mood I will trek back to this location for more yummy chicken.   The place could use a bit of a scrubbin though. Oh well can't have everything, huh.

A nice clean restaurant. Always greeted as if they are happy we are here. The food for the most part is quite good. A few dishes that are not to our taste. but that could be us, not them.

This little restaurant is a place we go to when shopping at 35th Ave. Sew & Vac.   As you can see from the photo it is in a very dingy strip mall and you might not ever think of checking this little gem out. Do, you will not be sorry.  The inside of the restaurant is an odd piece of work too. Very old fashioned bad taste in decorating, but I think this makes for an even better experience. Each time we have gone there is only one table waiting for us and the rest is filled. Odd huh ;-[) The woman who I assume is the owner waits and who knows what else. She is not really friendly, but nor is she unfriendly. All I can think of calling it is very focused with the real desire that you are enjoin your food.  The food is just wonderful. I have tried several dishes both Greek and Italian. Each has had such dead on flavours you just mutter to yourself, God this is good. I mean even the very basic salad that comes with some of the plates is always COLD crisp lettuce and a variety of other veggies with a great dressing.   I hope when you all try this place you find it just as I.

My sweet guy mentioned one day he would like a wallet from Louis Vuitton. So I go to Scottsdale Fashion Square and find the store. I was greeted by a nice young man and mention what I am looking for. He showed me what they had, which is very limited. I pick the wallet that would suit Gus's needs and desire, They wrap it up for me and on my way I go. Gus was very pleased to get this present and it is a good thing too since I can not believe how much money they want for plastic.

Many years ago when we were remodeling one of of our homes we stayed at the Camelback Inn for two months. It was a great place then, nice room with a very private large patio and small kitchen set way back in the resort. I loved it. They have remodeled this resort recently so we decided to go take a look. They were nice enough to take us on a tour and show us a variety of rooms/suites. It has been done very well and geared to complete sensory pleasure. I will be reserving a room here next time my sister is in town just to get a more complete feel for the property. But so far, very nice employees and fantastic grounds.

What a total disappointment. Nowhere as good as the original. IT seemed like a set rather than an actual town. The night we were there not much was open or going on in this place. A couple of store fronts were open with nothing of interest inside.  We also had dinner there that night. Oy vey what generic crap  they were serving. The place feels like an old gym made in to a restaurant with much too loud of music playing. If you were not deaf before you went in you would be for hours after you left.  Man just so disappointing.

I do not know why, but my experiences here have never been good. It is not the wait for a table that bothers me, hell you wait and that is the way it is. I do mind that it has never taken less than 25 munities once seated to get service. I am not kidding either; folks who go with me are always amazed. Once we finally get an order in it takes another 25 or more. WHY WHY WHY? We get our food, sometimes it verges on good and more often than not just uninspired. I have given this place so many chances I just can not continue.

I remember seeing a lot of places similar to this when I was a kid driving around the country with my family.  This restaurant still has that fifties feel for the most part. We stop when we are on our way to San Diego always arriving at breakfast time, so this is the only meal I have ever had here. It is always decent at good prices. What more can one ask for.

My friend Mario loves this place he goes and buys a lot of stuff all the time. Some times I think my friend Mario is nuts. ;-{)  I really dislike this store. I guess the location is to make one feel like they are going to a discount basement. You know like Filene's in Boston. I just feel  like I am going down to a toilet. It is too crowded with crap I would never spend even the least amount of money on. The men's area is to me a joke. Too many folks I would not want to rub up against in too small of an isle. I do not know buy I always get the feeling furtive looks are being shared between the customers. Just too creepy for me. I hate mess and this place is messy. I will take a nice clean well thought out store any day, with good merchandise that is. Damn the prices..I suppose this place serves a purpose, but not for me.

My sister and I went here not thinking much of it since it is a clothing store first. But we liked the look of the place so why not. We did not have to wait to be seated and were greeted by the waitress right away. I think we were the last table available at the time. Our drinks were brought about three minutes after we ordered and our lunch was in about ten more minutes. We both had soup and a sandwich. Neither was stellar but good enough to think, hey this is not bad. I would go back and give it another try. So our food was good, the service was good and a nice place to sit.

Being in the mood or not.  You know if one is not in the mood one might not buy as much as those who sell might like.  Moods can be altered with outside stimuli.  This mall Scottsdale Fashion Square really missed the mark with its holiday décor. In fact one has to actually search for any decoration at all.  Bah Humbug seems to be the lay of the land and that is really too bad.  I want the whole experience when I shop for my gift and the only place that really put an effort out is Nordstrom, nice it was.  I will find somewhere else to shop that has the spirit; but this mall sure is not it.

NO wait to get in.  Seated at a table as requested.  Wandered to check the food, a lot to look at.  Tried a variety of foods from a variety of cultures all made in a kitchen in a Las Vegas Hotel. Nothing transported me to the culture represented and the best I could say is, very uninspired.  I do not remember any contact with a waitperson so who knows. But our plated were cleared when we came back to the table so they must be there doing their jobs.

Let's see, over 50... check  old white man...........check  eats dinner ...............check  listens to the piano  check   wow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat.  Dude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance.  Fool is my review of wanugee N.   Now on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too.   Back to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China.  But I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.

Well We Went To FEZ Today For Lunch.  I was warned about a few things.  1. I will feel like I am 100 years old. Why, well because of all the pretty young things giving me the evil eye. 2. I will hate the music. 3. The service sucks. Because of the sweet young things which I was led to believe included the wait persons.   The cast members today are, Bruce, Meredith and me, Mike.  As we were entering we were discussing the fact about the patio is being remodeled. So when the Tall guy came to seat us he heard us talking and with a very questioning face and voice said "You want to sit out on the patio?"  Well of course we didn't it is well over 100 today. So we all chuckled about it and was seated at a nice cool table.  By the way Tall guy can be most guys as I am a Short guy.  Another tall guy I believe his name is Chad came over to take our drink order. So I with the iced tea; brewed please, ~B lemonade and ~M coffee also an order of sweet potato fries.  What we ate:  ~Me a FEZ burger m/r with no cilantro sided by the salad. ~M a tan-tan chicken sandwich also with the salad. ~B an all American burger with no mayo or cheese and must be VERY WELL DONE.  All of us enjoyed the fries, they really were quite good.   My burger was as I ordered. It is more burger than I can eat at one seating so home it went. Although I liked the salad for some reason each bite made me cough so ate little of it. It was a reaction to my allergies, not to do with the food.   ~B his burger was VERY WELL DONE but did come with what looked like a version of mayo. He ate it and liked it with no result of death from suffering the indignities of the mayo.  He did change out his drink since the lemonade had little lemon flavour.   ~M ate most of hers except the bun side with the baba ganoush spread on it; it was not to her liking.  Chad at times is a little disconnected, but nothing to rant about.   Now for the warnings.  There we no pretty young things, so I felt my age ;-{) I liked the music and why anyone who knows me would think I would not is beyond me. The service does not suck. Although Chad is a nice looking guy as were all the wait people they do not qualify as pretty young things and they were all friendly. I must admit I was fascinated by the REALLY TALL blond guy. He was not our wait person but I enjoyed watching his face when talking to his customers, very expressive.   I did Spy Thomas. I believe he was just coming in. He is very well put together.  Yeah I will be back.

Libraries are a wonderful thing, now if folks would just learn how to pronounce the word library. ;-{)  This library has such a good variety of books, recorded too. The video library is fairly good too. I also love the option of ordering a book to be ready for you when you arrive. The folks working there are consistently helpful.  The building it self normally would not catch my eye as I am not particularly drawn to the modern aesthetic. Yet I find myself looking at the corners of the interior and its structure it is actually pretty cool.  The parking too is quite easy.  We are lucky to have such a place where cheap folk such as I can get a good book to read.

My office is now with in walking distance, but we have been going here since it was Dee's. We being a couple of guys and I. So today Bruce said; lets go to lunch, I say, ok. He then says; I know anywhere except 5Th ave. The boy knows me so well ;-[) I tell him no I will go today, it has been a while since I have given in and gone with the masses. I just do not like the place. So we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress. This place always has nice wait people. She talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order.  Oh the food, the food. I order a french dip with Cole slaw and a side of onion rings. Bruce has his usual a BLT with well done bacon and fries. Now mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food. Which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food. What I get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain. Now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly, piled nicely on the bun. It should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus. I mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain, always. The bun on which it sat was just that, a meat seat. I also love Cole slaw and usually will eat what is served, not this. Totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour. The rings looked good, but looks can be deceiving. So Bruce you are right, any place but 5Th ave.

We had reservations and we were late. I hate being late but I was not in control of our group that night so there you go. But even though we were late they greeted us with a smile and still had our table waiting.    We then were greeted by the wait person, a very nice woman with a great smile. She took our drink orders and appetizers .It all came very quickly. But it did not feel we were being rushed in any way.   I honestly can not remember what we all ordered for the actual dinner. But I do know it was VERY good. I was surprised in that we have had a recent string of crappy meals in other places that this is what I was expecting. But lucky for us we all truly enjoyed our food and time.    This was a few weeks ago and it is time to go back ;-[)

I like the music most of the time about 99 percent of the time. It does as it advertises, makes me want to move.  What I do not like is the banter of the radio folk, usually inane nonsense. Cut down on the talk and play more music. I mean I can get downtown from my home in the far west valley and never hear a tune. Yuck. I love to dance while I am driving, give some music, please.

The place is huge.  We have shopped here for gifts for the father in law, or otherwise known as Gus' dad.  He loves everything we get him and he has been ordering from the catalog since it first started.  For me it is a huge monument to death and torture with the equipment to cook it all up in the end.  But if that is what you are in too it does not get better than this.

Was here about a week ago.  Busy but not too busy to a seat could be had.  Friendly folks working here and quick to get the food out.  The sandwich was fine as they always are.  The soup was good as well.  Gus enjoys this place more than I, but for me it is fine enough that I do not go in kicking and screaming.  I have never seen so many folks with laptops humming away and no sign of food next to them so I assume they have eaten and are now done. I guess the hazard of offering free wifi.

Perhaps and it is very possible I do not understand the concept of restaurant week. It seemed it was or is to attract potential customers with less than average prices for above average food and service, you know so we will come back when we feel like spending what it normally takes.  We went to Kincaids because a friend of mine wanted to try the place and this seemed like the right time. Our dining companions are referred to as M&M.  First off, how does this place stay in business? The location is desolate when no games or other venues are in play. Nothing to do or see before or after eating here, too bad.  We were greeted and seated by a nice guy. At first we were placed in a booth, it seems to be the choice of most. Unfortunately it does not fit my legs so we moved to a table. We made a reservation, but it was apparent it was not needed as they were not busy. No one in the bar, and only about six tables or groups in the dining room. Our server Tina greeted us with a big smile and ready to take our drink orders along with telling of her favourite appetizers. Gus and I both ordered a classic mojito, something we have never had. One sip and I could feel accelerated tooth decay taking place. God what an overly sweet drink, and not in a good way. Neither of us drank this experiment in sugar. Our dinner companions ordered something more in the line of an adult drink and enjoyed very much. I found out about an hour ago Gus wanted to order off of the main menu but did not want to appear as a party pooper so he stuck with the RW menu. I too felt the same way and this is a good example of not speaking up and finding you should have. We both had the Maytag blue cheese salad, yes it was cold, and yes it was crisp but uninspired. M&M one Maytag and one clam chowder, neither made comment as to being good or bad. We then went on to the bacon wrapped Kobe meatloaf, mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and sweet-sour- red cabbage, this being 18 dollars on the main menu. Again uninspired comes to mind, we make better meatloaf at home and our gravy has flavour. The cabbage was neither sweet nor sour but a rather dull flavour of what it should have been. Our deserts were the chocolate cake and a key lime pie. Neither were the best or worst we have had. M&M had the salmon and chicken, again no mention of enjoyment.   I know it sounds from what I just wrote that it was pretty horrible. It wasn't it was just not at the top of anyone's game. The restaurant is a nice looking place with friendly folks who seem to be rushing around getting things done for a non crowded place. The intervals between courses were a bit longer than they should have been, but did not upset any of us since we enjoyed our company and conversation. The only way I can think of to describe the quality of the food is that it was cooked by a line cook and not a chef.   Again I could be wrong, but it looks as though some restaurants were added to the list after we went to Kincaids, some offering an actual steak at the steak houses. Kincaids offered the least they could.  Polishing makes most things shine, this place needs a good hot waxing. Too many places in Phoenix that shine to make this a place on ones rotation.  One last thing, Gus was up all night with an upset stomach. He never gets upset tummies so we suspect something here was not settling well with him.

When we lived on Central ave. I think this is a restaurant we visited. I am not positive though. The food was great, but the yelling at the woman out front from tha back got to us. So we stopped going. But as I said, I am not sure this is the place, but it the right location.

I have eaten at several different locations of Coco's. For some reason this one is always the one that serves the best food with the best service.  Having eaten a variety of foods here and never have had anything to complain about, is pretty close to a miracle. I bitch about everything. Even the steaks are always cooked as I ask, med-rare and they are tender and have a great flavour. I just wonder why this location? I guess I am just lucky my sister made me pull in the parking lot one morning.

When shopping at Sun Vally Quilts we often stop at Don Jose. The restaurant is a part of a rather dismal strip mall and the inside of this place is pretty much what you would expect.   But it is inexpensive with decent food and a lot of it.   The guy taking orders is very nice and concerned for his customers. He deals with the older crowd from Sun City very well. Helpful does not say enough.  It is too bad they can not control the other customers conversations as we had the luck to overhear about eight bovine brained men making fun of the now married gay folks in California and the current situation.

This store sells all kinds of sewing machines and teaches you how to use them. But after you have that machine there is a great selection of fabrics for your imagine to take hold. They also have some great sales every now and again.

Mikie, that's me silly silly me.   After Showing a home I was told to pick up some chicken on the way home. So the only chicken place on my was KFC.   I do not like this store but it was supposedly cleaned up since my last disastrous visit. So I figured it must be better, right....   So I walk in and there is one guy taking orders. A nice queen of a guy who had all the sweeties, dears and honeys down pat. He did his job well and as I watched seem to do everyone else too.   I ordered a bucket of twelve pieces with sides. And as it has always been with this store, no chicken ready to go. It will be ten minutes I am told for the breasts to be ready. So I say OK. 27 minutes later I am getting my order. In that wait time they made four orders that no one was waiting for. The other folks that came in after I; had left before me. Each of those orders involved breasts. Finally Mr. queen noticed I was still standing and waiting he gets my order, well tells the girl to pack it up.   I get home and find one breast in the order. Silly silly me....

Having read Amber G.s review today and knowing I would be in the area her review convinced me to stop in Don Rafa for lunch.     I do not know how they can do this but they need to find a way to be better noticed. I have been to the furniture stores right next to this place several time very recently and I never noticed Don Rafa.     OK So considering it is in a strip mall building it is not a bad looking place inside. The tables are not placed too close together so you do not feel cramped.      I ordered the tacos, expecting to get one al pastor and two barbacoa. They had no barbacoa. Ok this pisses me off for two reasons. One, I went to their web site before I went to the restaurant to see what I wanted to order. Since I had to choose another I would have had to read the menu and I did not have my glasses with me so I went with two al pastor, and one Don Rafa since that is the other one I remembered. The other reason it bugs me is if you are not going to have what is on the menu, do not put it on the menu in the first place.      The chips they brought first were unremarkable, much like I could buy at Fry's. My actual tacos were just fine, they had the flavour; but a bit dry. I would order them again.      As for service, it was fine really. I am just picky in this area. The young man who served me should learn that serving is more than the delivery of a product. One should smile, one should develop a personality, one should speak so the customer can hear you. Oh and your choice in eye wear is odd. ;-{) This guy was not unfriendly, he was just there and he did his job in delivery well. Oh yeah even if one is only drinking water a refill would be nice .      I am not as enthusiastic about this place as Amber G. but it is good enough to go back and try other dishes.

Gus said, pick a spot for dinner. Knowing he has not been here I picked Don Rafa as I liked my lunch for the most part.   6:30 pm Saturday night and no one in the place when we enter. Well two employees were sitting watching the game on TV, very loudly. I know I have mentioned this before, but I hate TVs in restaurants. I should have turned around and left, but chose not too. Both employees wandered to the hall at the back when we entered. NO greeting of any kind not direction to a table. We sat ourselves which I guess is OK since we were the lone customer. Another expressionless young man comes to the table to take a drink order. Must be the trade mark of the restaurant, no expression, no smile, no hello, no spark in the wait staff. I think I would pick something else as my trade mark.   We ordered one of those round cheese things, the name escapes me. It was fine, after all how can you screw this up.  I ordered the Taco Taco Platter and Gus had the Chile Relleno. I honestly have no idea what has happened to the food but it was just not good. I took bites of a few things and could not continue and Gus said the same about his. So we paid the bill and went on our merry way.   This was too expensive to try again and get crap food and lackluster wait service. Adios

I love soup, could eat it every day. Rarely do I find a place where I enjoy all the soups available, but Mimis fits the bill. They have enough choices to satisfy my many moods. I usually get a grilled cheese to go along with it. Did I mention I love grilled cheeses too. I know I have ordered other foods here but can not remember what. I do know I have enjoyed it all. We have also been lucky to get an up beat server with each visit. I also love the building, I want one overlooking Lake Tahoe for a house.

This is for the credit card department of Chase Bank.  Our ID has been compromised five times and each time Chase has caught it as it is happening. They call to make sure it is not we who are charging these item and close the account right then. We have never had to do anything beyond acknowledging their actions.   One time in Paris France Gus dropped his wallet at a restaurant. When we went back they had the wallet but not the chase card. We called Chase, they stopped the card and sent another to a hotel in London for us the next day as we were traveling there in the morning. It was at the hotel when we arrived.   I have nothing but good to say about Chase credit fraud department, they are on the ball.

Gus and I drove out this way for some reason, I forget what we were doing.   So we stopped at this Village Inn for lunch.   Met at the door by a nice tall young man.   We were then again greeted by a young lady changing the salt and pepper shakers.   One more greeting was coming soon from our waitress. She was a very nice but not overly familiar, just like I like it. Her service was spot on.   Gus and I each had a burger and to my surprise it tasted like a real burger. Mine was called The Works Burger which means it comes with stuff I never have on a burger. It was supposed to have a sauce on it, this was left off, not by request. I could have asked for it, but decided to eat it as is and it was good. The onion rings that came with it were also very well cooked, nice and crisp. Speaking of onions, although there are grilled onions on this burger it also has raw on the side. I often ask, who gets the nice piece of onion, well this time it was me yay.   It was a nice lunch with good service and at a decent price. Simple pleasures.

Never having bought cloths here for myself my experience is limited to the employees. After entering I was asked if needed assistance. I told her I wanted a gift certificate. This is something she can help me with. We get to talking and she asks for whom this is for since no holiday was coming up. I told her a client for a house warming gift. She seemed confused at this and I just told her I listen to my clients and I always pick a gift to fit who they are and not just out of rote. Well this lead in to a very nice conversation and a very pleasant experience.

Staying at the Sunset Station, which by the way was much better than I had expected it to be.  Well Gus had some folks to meet for dinner and I was on my own. Figuring I would get something and take up to the room I walked around a couple of times and decided on Fatburger.  The young lady was quite personable with each who approached. She took my order of a burger with whatever it is they put on them and since the sign said the onion rings were the best you know one always believes signs I too had an order with a shake. And I wonder why I am a fat old man.   It took very few minutes to get my order and off to the room I go. Well the burger was a mushy mess of no distinct tastes, I truly hated it and the onion rings were bland at best. The shake... ok.  It was mentioned that we should stop at a fatburger the other day and this memory popped up and I shuddered, never again...

Just ate here, it was across the street when we looked up and said why not.  I will be honest, I was not expecting to like this place.  I could have not been more wrong.  A lot of tables in an open setting but still not overly loud with conversations intruding in to ours.  Waitress was nice and very efficiant.  The food was so much better than; as I said expected.   Mine came with spam of which I have never had and macaroni salad. I do not like macaroni salad but this was good, really good. The chicken, beef and shrimp was all very good as well.  They just need to take a look in the corners and give a quick clean.  Glad we looked up.

The building is very much an improvement for the neighborhood. It looks good but one might have a hard time finding parking during high hours. It did not take long to get our order taken by a gently speaking man. We each ordered a different dish and we all enjoyed that which we ate. I never mind if food fits or not a particular set thought, such as being Asian. If it is good is all that matters to me, it was all very fresh and well presented. So once again I had a very pleasant lunch with friends.

This place is creepy. You enter and pay and are given your utensils. Where you pay is a little island with stuff all over the place inside. I understand they seat you, no one sat us and we found our own seat. So I sat for a few seconds before I went hunting for food. Who ever decorated this place must have been drunk and stuck in the sixties, truly awful. So I went for the food. I started with a salad, how do all of those topping taste the same? I really mean it, how do they do that? The fruit was very fresh and good though. Segue on to the mains, a little Mexican, a little Chinese and all American. All edible but not really edible enough to want more. I did stand in front of the ham for a slice, but the people back there were flipping steaks and look at you and never make a move toward you to carve. It is funny too, they flip and they flip but no one ever gets a steak, weird. Dessert is just pieces of things that look like chocolate or carrot cake, but taste nothing like what the look like. This is a place for folks who want to eat until they puke and not care about what it is that made them puke. Flavour is not a consideration I guess.

Read all the fine reports in our community e-group. Read them here too. People talk of the interior. To me very bland, not slick. But what is more surprising to me no one notices how unfinished the place is. My God the booth that is against the window next to the entrance has no finishing. Tacky tacky tacky. There is a nice big hole in the wall toward the back on the west side, again tacky. The wood on the counter, unfinished. The place has been open long enough for these things not to exist.  I understand they serve food, how would one know? Nothing to indicate such. So we ordered two coffees and one Gelato. The Gelato was wonderful. The coffee was at best lukewarm and tasted as if it were make from the powdered coffees one celebrates the special times in ones life. Very nice servers but slow as molasses. I was so surprised at what we found considering the good reviews I have read. But I think it might have something to do with who the owner is as we have a lot of retired Air Force in my community.

I am not the person in my family who would ever say, hey lets go have East Indian food. Not that I do not like Indian food, I just never had good Indian food here in the USA. In London yes and go first thing when we arrive. But my mate a friend out voted me and we went to India Palace tonight.  It is located in a dingy sad strip mall but the actual restaurant is nice inside. It is clean and comfortable but does have some odd looking chairs at their tables.  We ordered a plate with a variety of meats on it some naan and rice, my friend ordered some chicken thingies and soup.. It all was very tasty with some of the bites hiding a bit more heat than others. So it is good enough that I would go back.  The service is very friendly but very erratic in getting dishes out to you and need a reminder that you did indeed order more than brought out. If the service could smooth it self out, it would have been a great meal.

I like the fresh and easy near me, well kinda near me on Dysart. But after telling a few folks about the place they say they do not find it. So as I was driving bye today, I can see why. The sign is so small and from the street not really noticable. This is too bad.

I find we have been lazy a lot this week and do not want to cook. So off to the Black Bear Diner we go. It seems the vehicle parked next to us when we arrive is even more lazy than we as it was in a disabled space with no insignia to allow such. When the owner left they were just a rather fat young couple with a couple of kids. When we arrive they are pretty busy and the wait folks look somewhat frazzled. They ask where we want to sit and take us to a both at the back of the restaurant. This is one place I do not mind booths as the seat is shallow enough to allow my legs to bend at the right place. I am not sure what was going on here tonight but there were an over abundance of bubbas and their bimbos eating here. Dinner and theatre; cool. We came for fish and chips because that is what we were in the mood for and could think of nowhere near home that serves this except BBD. But as it always turns out we did not have what we came for, instead we ordered the fried chicken dinner. The chicken reminds us both of chicken we had as kids, very basic but good. Tonight was no exception; it was good for what it is. It comes with soup or salad and two sides. I personally think the side choice leave a lot to be desired. But what we got was fine. We both opted for the salad, which it just too big. In fact, too much food over all. I wish places like this offered half the size for half the money. We just have to remember next time to order one and share. Our wait person was fine if not overwhelmed at first. But being in that lazy mood I just did not mind sitting and watching the bubbas. She was a nice young lady with very pretty eyes.

I love stores like this where I have no idea of what I am looking at. I really do not mind the set up in regions as I enjoy looking at it all. I bought several things and will be back. The folks here are extremely helpful as it took five persons to find what I was looking for, but they never gave up and found it with me only asking one person. It is still not close enough to my home but I will make the trip.

I can wash my car in my driveway and get good results. I for some reason can not get the glass clean, so off to the car wash I go. Like others I am told right away I need my cracks fixed. I tell them no thanks I like the pretty colors that the sun makes through them. I was then offered an oil change at a discount. No one really gives discounts but I did need an oil change so I said yes. The wash was to come with the oil change. I did ask how long will it take and I was told about a half hour. Two hours and twenty minutes later I am at the cashier waiting for her to get the guy who included my wash with the oil change in the deal to come and tell her, she did not believe me. That taken care of I go out to pick up my car. Oh also when I started I mentioned I am more concerned with getting the glass clean than anything else. I turn toward the street and sun and my windshield is more smugged than if I had done it. that will teach me to expect a car wash to get my windshield clean.

I think we made our first visit to this restaurant on March 21st 2008 at about 6 p.m... I can not really comment on the interior of this place as we sat outside. It was a wonderful temp with the orange blossoms giving off a fantastic fragrance.   We ordered;  I had the stewed lamb shank in tomato saffron sauce served with basmati rice. All the flavours were there. I enjoyed it as is but suggest it be served a bit warmer. My sister had the Combination of filet mignon and Koobideh kebob served with basmati rice. She also enjoyed her food but too found the temp off. My mate had a mixture of ground beef, minced onions and seasoning, skewered and grilled to perfection on a bed of basmati rice he too enjoyed his food but again the temp was not as it should be. So since the temp was not spot on I can only think the food sat for a bit before being served. We all shared a colorful plate of fresh cut mint, basil, Radish with Feta cheese along with some hummus and pita..         All of the food had good flavour and was enjoyed just not as hot as it should have been.   The wait person was a nice young man. He obviously has never been trained as a waiter, I am sure he will do much better if given some instruction assuming there is someone there that can do such.  The cook/chef should not stand on the sidewalk next to the restaurant smoking and spitting in view of the clients. Not appetizing at all.

The store is easily accessed and always clean. The employees are friendly, no idea about helpful as I have never asked a question here.   My first visit here some time ago was very disappointing. Nothing seemed fresh.  I did not give up though and have been back several times now and each time it is always a bit better than before. My only complaint of the vegetables these days is they seem to not have one of the products I need. Today was leeks, how can you not have leeks? Wal_mart neighborhood store on my way home had them.   But I do love the bulk spices where I can spend 10 cents at a time and get what I need for the day. Also the bulk grains and beans are great.   So overall this is a pretty nice store.

I now know about service, it sucks.   I was looking for a few things and asked an employee if they had them and if so where do I find it?   One item was bulgur wheat. The person I asked did not seem to understand my question, so I spelled it out for her. She had never heard of it and said if we have it , it will be out there somewhere as she pointed in the general direction of the whole store.   On to the next question. Do you have crystallized ginger. She said it is in the produce department. I said I do not want fresh, but crystallized. She looks at me and once again said I do not know, I never heard of it.   My thought not expressed was, well dumb ass ask someone who might know. But this seems to have been a foreign concept to her as she made no move to do so.   I pick up a few other things I needed and had several more to find.  That being dill, no dill. Another being mint. Oh they had mint alright, it is called live mint it has three leaves on it with stems leading to a root ball. I was kind of looking for mint that can be used today.   I continued on looking for items and could not find half of them,   Knowing my level of frustration and what happens when I reach the top of it; I figured I better get out of this place before I do something really stupid. So I left and went to Safeway and they had everything I needed with great service in finding what I could not.   This is my last visit to sprouts, it has been a frustrating place to shop for a long time now and I would be even more dumb than folks think I am if I continued repeating these experiences.

While my mate was backing the golf cart out of the garage he did not notice the door had not fully opened. Hit bumped the door and dislodged two of the rollers. So I called Avondale Garage Doors. They asked if tomorrow will work for us. They then asked where we lived, after telling them he said our community gets priority service. They will do it now. Why we get such service I have no idea, but who am I to argue. They were here with in twenty three minutes and just left and the door is as it should be. Cool huh.

Stopped by today to try the newly advertised Beijing Beef. It is advertised as Crispy, Tangy and Tasty. It was limp, no tang what so ever and yes it has a taste, purse sweet. Yucky poopie. Of what can ne expect of Panda Express. The place was clean and the employees very friendly.

The current appliances in our kitchen came from Spencer's. We will not be going back.  We ordered the appliances when we started building this house. It was suggested we do so to lock in the price. Ok fine since we did not have to continue with the sale if we did not wish too.  Time comes for delivery; they no longer have access to the fridge I picked. I picked this one for very specific reasons. So fine we have to pick another.   So we expect delivery the next day, no way. Nothing no calls nothing. We call them are told that it will be a few days because the it will take that long to get them from where ever they get them. Now mind you the commercial style stove had been ordered seven months prior. We had to wait a week. They finally delivered the stove, but forgot the grills on which one cooks. No one knows where they are. They bent the back of the stove by cinching it too tight to the dolly. I tell them just put it in I can not see the back. They say they can not install the hood and fan that day, will be back tomorrow morning. Never came back. It took two days to get an answer as to when they will bring the grates and install the hood. The grates came via UPS and the guy who came to install the hood said he does not know how to install on the granite wall. So we tell him to just forget that part and install the actual hood. He can't, why I never understood. Someone else came four days later and installed the hood and brought the fridge. The door on the fridge is scrapped up. They replace it with a new one a few weeks later and this one has a very crooked logo on the door and with a very week seal on the door. We saved very little money with this purchase. But we were irritated beyond any savings. Oh and I hate the fridge in my kitchen. It will be replaced but not by Spencer's .

This restaurant is just now having it's grand opening. It is in the developing area along Estrella Park Way.  The building it self is nothing of note just another new strip mall structure, and the inside although not in typical Chinese decor; is more of an office break room feel.   The folks running the place are friendly and personable. I am not sure if they really intend for folks to eat in or not but there are several table to do so. You order the food at the counter from a menu that is not unlike all Chinese fast food joints. If you are eating in,  find a table and they bring the food out to you. What i found odd is that it is served on plasitc to go plates with plastic untensils. But I guess this is normal anymore since we live in a to go throw away world.  The food, well I must say it was better than I had expected. Rich full flavours and good texture to each dish we tried. Do not expect adventerous food here, just basic fare that is for now, tastey.

It slipped again. This time for the last time for us. Gus promises we will never go back even if he is being lazy and does not want to drive a little more down the road. This is the closest Chinese to our home, but hey we might move anyway.  This time around was very odd, four tables with no chairs and none to be found. So While Gus was ordering I asked for a cloth to clean a dirty table with chairs. She suggested I move the chairs to one of the empty tables. I said do not want to sit at one of those tables, I prefer one in a corner where no one can pass behind me. So she went over and washed off the table for us, with a smile I might ad. Look these are really nice folks running this place and I wish I liked it. But God the food is just horrible. Gus ordered a beef dish that looked and tasted like it was drenched in a molasses sauce. Mine was spicy but no flavour and the rice was just yucky, how do you screw up white rice.

Decided to stop at Lee Lee today since we were in the neighborhood. The restaurant was open this time so we thought why not try it.  The sign at the arch under which you enter says, please wait to be seated. We did and when seated it seemed as though we were dumb for waiting. This sign I assume means nothing since all who came after waited until the wait person waved them on and said sit anywhere.   I love the menu as it has a bunch of foods one does not find on other Chinese menus around town. It is also missing a lot of that you do find in all other restaurants.  The wait person who was taking our order first came over and asked if there were any questions. I do appreciate this as I am not always familiar and it is nice to be asked rather than seeming stupid.  We ordered off of the lunch menu. Both Gus and I got the same thing which in it self is very unusual. We had the L8 BBQ Dual Rice Plate. You get a choice of two selections from the BBQ list. We chose Roast Duck and BBQ Pork. Both were very tasty with very crispy skin. The quantity of meat was much more than I had expected. I also enjoyed the crispy pickled veggies on the side. All in all I was very satisfied with the food and will be back to try some of the more exotic dishes.

The one and only time I visited was just enough to make me not want to try again. I went early enough in the lunch period that they should have what is on the menu. I tried to order two dishes to go, neither was available. So I just order what ever catches my eye at another glance at the menu. One chicken dish and one pork. Both were dry and just bad. My mate opened his box and took a bite and asked me what this crap was and tossed it in the trash. I made a couple of clubs at home instead.

Beijing is a proper restaurant with the ability to take out. So few Chinese restaurants go for the restaurant feel these days settling for the fast food set up. So for me that gives them two stars. The dcor is an odd mix of formal style tables and chairs with gold Chinese imagery wall paper and two differently shaped hanging lights though out. An odd mix that seems to work. I think this place has been open a week or so. When seated I was asked if this suites me, not very often does that happen. It did. The server was quick and efficient; either friendly or unfriendly as he was the only server and taking care of everyone well. The bus person refilled my drink and kept an eye on my glass. I ordered a lunch special which comes with a choice of soup, white or fried rice and an egg roll and crab puff. My choice was the Szechuan Shrimp (onion, carrots and peas) I honestly do not know if the carrots were from frozen or not as they tasted as they should, but were so precisely cut. I do know the onions were fresh. The shrimp were cooked well as they were tender and tasted like shrimp, the sauce although a bit orange in color was tasty with a nice heat to it. I chose the fried rice which was a very light fry. It was fine. The egg roll was pretty good as was the crab puff and I do not like crab puffs, but this one has actual filling in it. I also opted for the hot sour soup, it had the usual ingredients and well balanced. So yes I did enjoy my lunch, no not the very best I have had but good enough to go back as long as it stays at this level or better.

Having been born and raised in N.W. Dropsonia this makes me an expert on grocery stores. And this one I like, the Mexican music makes me wiggle down the isles while I pick up the cheap and plentiful produce. It is not really any better produce than other grocers, but much less expensive. The meat counter cuts its meat in much thinner portions than others do. I prefer thin as apposed to fat. The already marinated chicken and beef is also quite good. The folks who work here are always very nice and helpful if one needs assistance.

I am tired, really tired of spending and being disappointed.   We came for dinner tonight.   Mike, Mer~, Gus and I were the eaters of note.   Mike had the lamb stew, it was over salted and peppered and he left half of his meal, he never leaves food on the plate.   Mer~ had the Shepherds pie which was to have Angus beef carrots peas and parsnips with fresh herbs, Of course topped with the mashed potatoes.  What she got was a whole lot of potatoes and a small side of peas with a speck of beef. Truly underwhelming with poorly portioned ingredients   Gus did not enjoy his meal of Beef pie with puff pastry crust. Tough dry beef with no flavour other than salt, the pastry top was not fresh as it was difficult to cut let alone eat.   I had the one good dish of the evening; the Pork shank. It was cooked well and tasted fine.   The restaurant/bar is ok I guess. No real feel of Ireland; more like what an American might think of Ireland. It is just too contrived to feel authentic even if the pieces are from Ireland.   The music was much too loud. Most pub - restaurants in Ireland when music is played real folks are doing it and often the folks join in. Here it is just too loud to hear your companions talk.   The wait folk seem like there is no real interest in being there. It is like, ok I am here what do you want.   Other customers at the bar were Americans acting like they expect folks at an Irish pub would act. Loud and obnoxious. Most customers in Irish pubs enjoy themselves with a bit more decorum.   Overall the experience sucked with one bright spot, my meal. I never felt I left Arizona either.

My little car that has been running well since 1990 decided to throw a fit when I got on the freeway this last Monday. It seems the power steering seized up and broke the belt. In the process it also tore some bolts off another part from which that belt drives.   I took it to Wilhelm as they have done service for us before. They looked over the situation and called me to tell me what it will take to fix. I said ok fix it. They had it done the same day. But when they called to tell me it was ready to go they asked if the air conditioning was working before I brought it in. It was, in fact they are the ones who recharged it a year prior. So they took it back in and looked at it and called me back to say the belt caught the wiring and pulled it out of the generator and that part will need to be replaced as the wiring can not be fixed. They then told me how much it will cost. I told them forget it I would not spend that kind of money on this old of a car. So I picked it up and drove home. On the way home the check coolant light came on. It has never done that before. So I called them thinking they had done something as it was in the area they were working. They dais bring it back they might have dislodged a wire. My mate Gus took it back and when he got there told them to fix the air too as he was much too hot driving it to the shop. I am the cheap one in the family. SO they fixed it and no problems since.  They are very friendly, helpful and explain everything until you understand. They also pickup and drop you off if you need that service. I am a total dummy when it comes to the workings of a vehicle so I have to trust they are telling me the truth of what needs to be fixed. The only reason I do not give them five stars is I just do not think anyone is worth 800 bucks in labor for less than one eight hour period. It just kills me to spend money in the first place ;-{)

Stopped here today on my way home. It is in the back of a strip mall and could easily be missed if not looking. The glass front doors could use a nice washing. I assume it has been a while since that has happened from the looks of it. The inside looks to me much cleaner but dated. Wood wainscoting topped with raspberry paint, one or two chandeliers much too small for the space and as usually art work hung too high on the wall. But it all felt good. The woman greeting me did so with a smile. She took my order and in asking; spicy? I said yes.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, which came with hot sour soup and eggroll and I assume a crab thingie. The soup was very good with a nice rich deep flavour. The Kung Pao too was quite good although not spicy as expected. But that was fine as the flavour was to my liking while the veggies were nice and fresh.  I also liked the eggroll as it was thin and just the right crispiness. The crab thingie was just sort of there, I don't get those things. This lunch came in at $5:63 total. I will be back. Oh and the woman waiting on me was very attentive without being intrusive. She seemed to really care if I was enjoying the food and I was.

This is a Burger King that you will not find on the Burger King web site. No idea why since it has been here for maybe a year.   Well anyway I was driving back from a listing and for some reason pulled in here, I am not one to patronize Burger King, but I did.  I ordered the Steak House Burger combo. They were very quick in getting this out the drive through window. Oh and yes the window person was polite.  The burger is an odd looking thing, very flat and wide, larger than the bun oh and also quite thin. It is piled high with fried onions, lettus, tomato, sauce and cheese. It has a decent taste but for some reason it felt as if I were eating a mutant burger. The fries were fine I guess. I am not much for fries so not an expert.  For me this burger is too much food, a good one to share. Hmm why do I order a combo if do not like fries, I will have to remember not too next time.

We have been here a few times since it has opened. It of course is a nice clean new store that is easy to navigate. The folks here are helpful and are more than willing to stock what you need if they do not yet have it. The prices are in line with the rest of these kinds of stores. The location is now the closest to our home so they will see a lot of us as we love to spend money on things for our home that we do not need.   You might miss this store as it is behind the new McDonalds on Estrella Parkway.

Not being a drinker this is not a store I would ever really think about checking out. But there are times one needs wine and some hard liquor for company. This place has it seems everything and at reasonable prices, Not knowing much I asked several question of an employee so I would be getting things our Friends would actually drink and they answered everything with enthusiasm.

British Airways flies from Phoenix Sky Harbor to London Heathrow every evening except on Wednesdays. Very convenient for we Phoenician's who love to travel to England.  We have never had a delay leaving Phoenix but on occasion are held up in London due to weather. If one travels coach expect it to be rather cramped and for a ten hour flight that can be a bit trying. The flight attendants without fail try to make your trip comfortable no matter what cabin you choose. When we are feeling cheap and do not want to fly business class we go for the World Traveler Plus. This is in between coach and business and it gives you just that bit more room for personal space. The food has been good each time we have flown. They give you enough of it too.

British Airways is the most direct route from Phoenix to Heathrow London so it is the flight I have used several times.   I also had enough credit for two flights in first class round trip yet how does one get this? I took a morning and started from Jan 1st through Dec 31st trying to get a flight using my points. Why did I do this, well the dates I wanted were never available so I thought I would see what dates were available. Oh and I tried coach through first class on each attempt and in all of that time frame only could I find four dates available and only in coach so I booked it and got back yesterday. I still have points but have a feeling I will never use them since this trip made me realize travel is no longer fun. You get trapped in a cabin so tightly fit with seats one can not even breathe, not to mention the air quality sucks and much too warm. Hell the food looked like cat food and tasted just about as good. Now I will say the folks working the flights were very nice, but nice does not make up for the actual physical layout of the jet. Each trip was delayed for some reason sometimes we waited to board and other times we waited while on the jet just sitting there.  It states on their web site that there are no black out dates for travel, but check back often as seat open up. So right there it is stating there are indeed black out dates if no seats are available. Nope no more stinky depressing flights with British Airways for me.

I think perhaps fast food chicken places hire the most stupid of all employees available to the fast food industry.  We have stopped here a few times to pick up food and eat it at home. Not once have we gotten what we ordered. Ok I am sure now you are thinking I must be the most stupid of customer for not checking before I leave. Well yeah I agree with you. But this last time we ordered 12 pieces, I did look in the bag to see that all that we ordered was there. I did not take the chicken out to count it, we got eight pieces. Gus called to complain and all they said was, what am I supposed to do about it? So I will answer that question now, Nothing do nothing and I will wise up and just bypass your store from now on.

This building has been a variety of restaurants, none were ever good enough to stick.   If effort and results have anything to do with staying power we should have a winner this time around.  The food so far has been quite good in a nice setting with a good staff.  This restaurant is located in Estrella, once known as Estrella Mountain Ranch.  So take a drive up there and take a look around, a nice community with now a nice restaurant to enjoy a meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Oh and of course if you decide you must move up there, give me a shout and I will help you find just the right home for you.

I for some reason was in the mood for the only hamburger that can survive a nuclear blast and still taste the same. The quarter pounder with cheese or on this menu the #2. I also did something I rarely do, use the drive through. There were about eight cars in front of me, yet I was on the road with my #2 so quickly I was truly surprised. Every one could understand me and I them along with putting the right thing in the bag, I was in heaven.

HomeGoods is a new store in a new shopping center that just opened in the last few days. It is attached with a T.J.Maxx but has separate signage on the outside of the building. The company also owns several other names including Marshals.  I guess we were there on the opening day because the place was packed and I mean packed. We walked a few feet in to the store and I had to stop, I am not good with crowds. Gus asked me if I was ok and I said wait a moment while I take a breathe and calm myself down. So finally we continue on and start looking at stuff. They seem to have a little of everything. We had no intention of buying but wound up with a basket full of lamps, towels, canisters and other crap we do not need and got in line to get out which started at the back of HomeGoods weaved through the back and side of T.J.Maxx and across the front of both stores. We were out and paid for with in 25 minutes with all of our little treasures that would have cost us at least another 100 bucks elsewhere. Through out this whole experience they had employees stationed in the store to help in any way possible. I of course will be back when it is less of a mad house and see how well they fare. But for now yeah it was worth the panic inside.

A friend and I decided to try the Grill at the Wigwam today since neither of us had ever been. When we arrived the main room was closed to diners as it had a private meeting taking place so we were given a choice of a side room or the bar with a view of the golf course. We chose the side room and good choice as the bar had a small group loudly enjoying a golf game on the TV, which of course if fine since that is where one should enjoy such activity.   From what I understand this as were other areas of the resort recently remodeled. Like so many places that have been remodeled it seems they were playing it safe as not to offend, yet it does not excite. A nice republican staid feel to it.   We were greeted by a very pleasant man and seated directly. We were then greeted by the waitress who I think was Terri. She brought our drinks which was freshly brewed coffee. I had asked what brand and she said Starbucks, this surprised me as I liked that which she poured. She then explained it was a different blend from the blend they use in their stores.  My lunch partner and I both had a cup of clam chowder. the texture seemed more like a bisque but a very good flavour.  Mer had a pastrami sandwich and I the American Kobe burger. Both came with seasoned fries. My burger was quite good and much too big. So I now have dinner. Mer liked her pastrami and enjoyed every bite. We both liked the fries, yet I could only eat a few as they were just so full of flavour a few did the job.   Our wait person/Terri was very attentive and friendly through out and did as a wait person should, ask if we preferred dessert before she brought the check.   A very nice lunch was had.

We bought six trees from Elgins. We also had them plant these trees. We also warned them that it is a VERY hard dig since they had to blast to get our pool in.   They came and they dug and dug and dug a bit more, they never complained or tried to charge us more for having to take much longer than they had anticipated.   All of the trees survived well and so did a lot of our other plantings with advice from them on how to take care of and remedy any current worries.  Very well priced, mannered and knowledgeable too

For a few years now and getting older I have gotten uneven streaks of gray in my moustache. Which I hate because it interrupts the shape line. So I have gone to Sally Beauty Supply to get dye to cover or fill in. I have no idea if the females working here have an knowledge or not, but I do know they are always very nice. The store it self as are all of them a pain in the ass. The isles are narrow and I mean narrow, get to big butted folks from apposing ends and one will have to turn around and come in for the other side. Or if as most often is a person leaning down to read a produce, forget moving for a few minutes. But other than that it is a fine supply joint.

What can make a person like one gas center over another? It is not the intoxicating scents from the fuel that's for sure. It is simple for me, it close to home and I can go late night or early morning when no one else is there since it is automated. I for some reason like being the only one pumping.

The folks that run this place are so very enthusiastic.   I have ordered two times a variety of product, cookies and such for neighbor get together at my home.  Both times I found the baked goods very dry and void of any richness. But knowing it might just be me I ask my guests what they think, after explaining they should tell the truth as I bought not made these tid bits and want to know if I should spend the money again. Unfortunately they agreed with my assertation.

Another one of the stores in this center that opened this last weekend.   Walk in there are several employees gathered at the front counter have a good old chat.   No other in the place but we the wandering shoppers. It seems much like Razmataz, has a bunch of stuff but the one thing we wanted. But hey they can't have everything, right. It seems to me a decent enough store and were greeted on our way out ;-{)   I do hate the lighting in these stores. So dull and it just saps the energy out of me.

Another new store here in Goodyear. This is one of the large targets that has a grocery and baked goods along with a satellite Pizza Hut. If I remember it also had a Starbucks in store. Of course the place is bright and clean since it just opened, but most Targets are anyway. This store has a  feel tending to Wal-Mart. The isles were a bit more narrow than I like. But it has a lot of stuff that needs to be crammed in. They also had a rather large area dedicated to Halloween which I suspect will be taken over by Christmas. The prices on things I would buy are no less than anyone else, yes they did have some good prices on things I would not be buying. You know, pop tarts, chips and canned coffee. I must say I do like the feel of the basket one pushes around the store, it fits my hands well. I do like Target stores so I am sure I will be back. Oh and the check out was super fast. It seemed like she was handing me the receipt before I even slid my card through.

As I am want to do, trying newly opened restaurants is kind of fun. So I stop in to the new AH-SO Sushi & Steak in Goodyear. It is an open modern room with a few TVs and overly loud rock playing. So I wait at the host table in the entrance and wait some more. There are perhaps two table of people already seated, not unusual for 2:25 pm. I spot the menu and as I wait I take a look, not over ambitious in choice and far from inexpensive but I figure give it a try. So I wait some more. But it the end I give the door another try and leave, I am not about to waste my life waiting for a fool to see they have a customer wanting to be seated. So for me it is AH-SO_No.

I can imagine the owner of this location is a bit worried since it has only been open a few months as have all in this center and Mervin's along with Circuit City are going out of business. What a way to start a business.   I have not tried this place simply because I did eat at one on the other side of town and did not like it.   Gus was in the mood so we stopped in on our way home. We both got the fiesta salad which I guess is kind of an odd choice but there you go.   A Very nice young man takes our order, same nice guy brings our food to us. As I look around I notice all the employees are pretty good looking.   The salads looked small, but as we ate found them to be very filling. Nice crisp ingredients and the chicken had a nice char flavour too. So now I know how stupid I am for judging one restaurant buy a sister store.   aYUP we will be back.

We stayed in four different hotels over the past two weeks or so.  This lovely Holiday Inn was the best of them all. Great location is a good start.  The front desk folk are all very friendly and make sure you are enjoying your stay.  It is a nicely appointed hotel in the common areas and quite clean.  Our room too was very nice in décor and with enough room for fat old me.  We also had a decent view.  Of all the hotels; the bed was very comfortable with soft and firm pillows.  Of which I am happy since this was our longest stay this trip.  You get some free stuff too if you want it. We did avail the Starbucks one morning.   One misstep was on our last day the room was not made up, but I do not stink too much so I was able to survive it all. ;-{)

New as of two days ago.   This Basha's is larger than the usual store and is being billed as a cross between a basic Basha's and A.J.s.    It is different in that the bakery, produce and butcher are all on the same side of the store. It also has a food court with I think, Italian, Mongolian BBQ, sandwiches and perhaps more, I am not sure. It I believe also stated it has wider isles, can't prove by my fat ass. This store so far has everything I want in a store. Well almost, I want fabulous looking and this place looks like a warehouse to me. I do not find it attractive at all.   As for employees, well mixed review on this front.   Yesterday we went in and asked about purchasing a 20lb prime rib on Sunday. The butcher said to us, if we come in Sunday we can get a better price on it, it might be $7.99 a pound or even $6.99 if we talk to him. It was listed at $9.99 a pound at the time. Ok so I decided that it was what I wanted and went back today to order it for pickup on Sunday evening. I went up to him and mentioned I am ready to order it, he lead me over to another guy saying he will take your order I won't be here Sunday. Ok fine, he takes my order and said it is $7.99 and I mention that the other butcher said it might be $6.99, he looks at me like I am nuts and said no. So I can only assume the other butcher was jerking my chain since he was not really going to be there on Sunday as he said he would be when I came in to get it. But other than that very nice employees.

If you read my first review of this store you would know I was planning on ordering a prime rib. Well I did on Friday for Sunday evening pickup along with 21 twice cooked baked potato's. When ordering I noticed there was something wrong with the guy taking the order, I later learned he was have an allergic reaction to something. When I get there on Sunday to pick up my order the butcher there was cleaning up for closing time and I tell him why I am there. He looks all over the place and can not find the order or evidence of one ever being made. So he with a smile and great attitude made up what we needed and got it to us quite quickly. This Butchers name I believe is Ed Peet, could be wrong about that but I think I am right.   So basically this review is about him, his great service and fantastic representation of his employer. Indeed five star service.   Oh and considering what was going on with the butcher who took the original order I can understand how it got forgotten. The poor guy looked pretty bad.

David Ramos is the guy I use when I need an infestation inspection on one of my listings. What reminded me is of his treatment or consideration of my last inspection I had him do today. As the home is set up he could have said yeah we need to treat, but being the honest guy he is, he found no activity and just billed me for the inspection. Hey these folks are hurting just like everyone else right now and it would have been real easy to lie and no one would know any difference.   So if you need monthly treatment for your home, give him a try. He is a nice honest hard working guy.

Another new business for Goodyear. It has been open a few weeks I believe.  This is a less elaborately set restaurant than others in the chain. This is not to say there is anything wrong with the building or its décor, just nothing special. At the moment it is the only business on the south east corner of Bullard and McDowell.   We had made a reservation for 7:30 PM. Saturday. When w e arrived there were several parties waiting, in fact it was overflow in the waiting area. Telling the hostess that we had an reservation we were seated right away, which often does not happen.   The young lady serving us was right on for drinks of which were served quickly. She had a very pleasant smile and demeanor.   We ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps along with Salt & Pepper Calamari for our starters.  The wraps were tasty and the Calamari was excessively salty.  Soup was also ordered it was the Hot and Sour. This had no spark. The flavour was flat and much too much corn flower for thickening.   Four different entrees were ordered, Cantonese Chow Fun, Sichuan Shrimp, Lemon Chicken and Crispy Honey Chicken. The Chow Fun was listless and lacking any discernable flavour, this too could be said about the Shrimp while the Lemon Chicken was pretty rout, nothing special and the crispy chicken was not crispy. The only dish with a proper serving was the Chow Fun, but since none was really great it did not matter. None of the mains were hot, all served at very close to room temperature.   Although the service was pleasant it was quite slow after the drinks were brought which might account for the temperature of the food.   Right now writing about it and thinking that what we got was sub par and too much money for product I doubt we will be going back.   Beijing just up the road is much better.

Nova Lox & Bagel is Sliced Lox, plain shmear, tomato, red onion & capers. Served on your choice of bagel. Sounds good huh, I had this on an everything bagel and Gus had garlic. It had a good portion of lox and cream cheese. I could have used a bit more onion, but I love onions so I am sure it was just fine for most.  I had not been to an Einsteins in a long time, years I think.   We sat out on the patio which is far enough off of the street to be comfortable with nicely trimmed plantings.   The coffee was not bad either.  Glad we stopped in, will again too.

Man I hate this store with all that I have.   Wide isles huh, yeah sure. You can not get up and down an isle to save your soul.   I hate the other shoppers, they come in and act as if they are in a museum looking over things that have never seen the light of day. Good God pick it up put it in your cart and move on.   The product; a bunch of stuff no one should ever eat. It is just all too silly.   Checking out, oh what an ordeal. It makes no difference if only one person is in front of you; it is going to take much too long with the chit chat between the cashier and customer. The lack of coordination in getting the food out of the cart and in to the personal canvas bags is astounding. wait for the fool to run back and pick something else up at the end of the transaction then you wait for them to get their card out to process a payment.   If I am ever again forced to venture in to one of these stores I am going to throw a hissy fit and wait in the car.   Man I hate this store.

oh well we had waited several months before trying this place.   An early dinner yesterday at about 4:30 pm.   Not busy so we were seated straight away. A booth, yuck I hate booths. This one was hot for some reason so we moved to a table with two chairs, I guess a half booth. It was much cooler.   I guy I forget his name was the server and he said at least three times I am going to take care of you real good and or well.   Well the first thing we order is our drink, me water Gus iced tea. Well the guy waiter took only a few moments to get this to us, but of course placed the drinks opposite to who ordered.   One appetizer, that being calamari.   MY meal was the Tour of Italy Being Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo.   Gus ordered Pork Milanese   Pan-seared pork scaloppini crusted with Italian herb breadcrumbs, served with asiago cheese-filled tortelloni pasta tossed in a garlic-butter sauce with fresh spinach.   We had the salad too.   So we get the salad, but the waiter wants to give a one soup and one salad. The salad was not really great.   Appetizer is set down and about three minutes later the entrees. First off learn to pace the meal dude and try to remember who ordered what. Not once did he get it right even though he claimed it would be good service.   I won't go in to each meal other than to say it sucked. Oh well another 53 bucks down the drain.

Our friends M & M wanted to try the Pasta Bar, so we did...  Oh the restaurant it self is fine, long and narrow. The music ick, the service friendly, the food double ick.  Yes I think the food is much too expensive for what you get, but when you get ick half the price would still be too much.  I of course said I enjoyed so M & M would not think me a crabby old man, but man they sure can pick some crappy places to eat.

Today 1:15 PM. 8-28-09   Gus Meredith and I went out to look at a house and since it was in the area we decided to stop and try Postino.   Yes there was a wait, but then considering the size of the building it does not take that many folks to create a wait. It was about 20 minutes before we were seated.   My back was pretty much to the whole of the place so I did not really get a change to look it over, but what I did notice was open and light.   I think the person who seated us and waited on were nice, it seemed that way any how. I was not in the mood to look up and study them ;-{)    I had the prosciutto with brie on focaccia with the Italian picnic it was the select two   Gus had bruschetta and I forget what choices he had   ~Mer had Autostrada   Well all I can say is I am happy we stopped here. the food was great, very fresh and clean where one can taste each ingredient.   So we will be back, aYUP.

I use this airline because you can pick your seat when you buy your ticket.   My flights with them are usually smooth and on time.   The flight attendants are able and friendly.   The last gate attendant when asked why we have no seat assignment when we had picked our seats. We were dismissed with" you will get on this flight". Surprisingly this is not what I asked and mentioned this to her. So with a sickeningly sweet smile said " we do not guarantee seats "   So to me this says why use this airline if I can get a better flight from another where seats are not picked.   Yes we got on the flight, but not sitting where we paid to sit, nor next to each other.   Yes the flight was full and yes all of the first class was full when we bought the tickets.   But there were plenty people who were not traveling with the person sitting next to them. Soooooo this does make a difference to me. I do things with specific thought in mind, I do not like having things out of my control. ;-{)

Last evening we joined our neighbors who were celebrating an anniversary. Our group of celebrants were 20.   They decided to hold this get together at the Verrado Grille. This part of the country club in Verrado. It is a very nice looking building with lit palm trees so at night it makes a great statement.   When we arrived we were greeted and shown to the party. As soon as we joined the group a wait person was asking what we wanted to drink. I believe we had three waiting on our group. They were quick and and never let us sit unattended. We spilled out on to the patio with a great view of the golf course. Once we decided it was dinner time we all gathered in the restaurant it self. It is a nice well appointed room with windows designed to allow a expanded view.   Dinner was a choice of three items off of the menu, one steak, one chicken and one fish. I had the chicken. It was fine, nothing spectacular, but fine. Each seemed to enjoy their meal and the restaurant it self.   We were well taken care of with no rushing or lack of service in a nice setting. I would use them for a gathering or just a nice dinner for two.

This fairly new restaurant has the unfortunate happenstance of being located on the corner of Thomas and Dysart. This is a center that has had legal trouble keeping other businesses from opening. So it is a quiet place.  Today I decided to give it a try. It was the lunch hour and I was the only patron the whole time I was there.   The décor is a nice modern Asian look. This restaurant can accommodate several folks, yet it has a nice open feel. The kitchen is open to view.  I did not order much, just a curry chicken with steamed rice. It came with a very nice hot sour soup. The main was served in a black lacquered Bento Box. I liked the presentation. It also came with a salad. I love salad so this makes me happy to see. The curry chicken was very fresh and generous so I will forgive that is needed a bit more curry flavour. I was satisfied just the same. They include a very lightly fried egg or spring roll, quite tasty. The only odd thing I found and I have no idea if it was intentional, the dipping sauce in the center of the box was refrigerator cold. Not objectionable, just odd.  Often times when one is the only patron the service is lacking, not here. I was well taken care of by a friendly lady.  As I was getting ready to leave I stopped in the restroom. Quite surprising as it was very nice with polished black one inch tiles on two walls and light aqua glass tiles on the other walls. The fixtures too were nice and plenty of room to accommodate more than one guest at a time.  I do hope others give this place a shot so they can have a shot at staying open.

This bakery has been here a while now. I did not stop in until a couple of days ago.   I can not speak on the deli aspect of it, I did not get any meats.   I did however ask for one item that in on the menu. I was told this is a special order item. Well then state it as such. So I got a poppy seed something or other. It was dough with poppy seed shaped in to a roll. One personal sized lemon cake and an eclair. The poppy seed doohickey had no flavour, I mean nothing. The eclair was pretty bland and tasted as less than stellar ingredients were used. The lemon cake was so bad it was trash canned after one bite.   So I can honestly say I have had better. Arizona has a hard time with good bakeries.   The bakery it self felt bordering on depressing. I could not stay there for long.

New here, many years in Minnesota.  Has a few tables but I think they are working more to the take out.  A clean unassuming place with neutral colors.  A somewhat limited menu. No lunch specials.  I understand the need for pricing, but with that I feel too high is the current prices.  One orange chicken, one chow fun and one pot sticker of the crispy kind.  I believe the pot stickers were deep fired. They were decent in flavour.  Chow fun was plentiful, but lacking in nuance, or in other words bland. The noodles seemed more like a basic wide egg noodle to me. I brought it home to spiff it up.   The orange chicken was too plentiful and was spicy with a definite orange flavour with white rice.   These items were served as is, no ad on such as one would get with most lunch specials.  The young lady who took the order and brought it to us was very enthusiastic and cheerful while answering all of our questions.  I really do not know if I will be back simply because I have had better food at a lesser price.    I hope you and others try it and find it to your liking because I want everyone to succeed

We as usual when going between Reno and Phoenix stay a night or two near or in Las Vegas.  This time we opted for Henderson and the SpringHill Suites.  It is quite modern in décor with beaded and sheer floor to ceiling drapery to divide the lobby and eating areas.  The room too was decorated in this modern mode with very sleek surfaces and lighting. We had one of the longer rooms with a seating area and a sleeping area. A very nice clean view of downtown - strip area. I would have liked this place a lot.  But...... once again the beds were just horrible and Gus too agreed with me and he can sleep on anything. So I guess we won't be staying here again. Too bad.

Always friendly and fast.  The food never seems to be watered down like some other shops we have visited.

My sister and I were driving around Buckeye looking at, good question, what were we looking at? All that looking made us hungry and being one in the mood for Chinese we spotted Great China. We parked and walking in to the place, it was a buffet, not something I usually choose but we decided to give it a try. Now mind you this is not an old restaurant but the booths and chairs were torn and warn as was the table top on the particular table we sat. The food was truly horrible, limp and flavourless. It was so bad we were laughing on our way out. What crossed my mind while sitting there and eating or pushing my food around was watching what I can only figure was the manager sitting at a table doing what might have been paperwork. I thought, look up man and see what you do not have here and change it. Another one of them thar boggles I get every now and again.

Stayed two nights.  I picked this place for location, but the location was not where I thought it was but that is my fault...getting old ya know. But speaking of location I suspect I will not stay here again since it is not well located for my needs... too bad for me huh.  We checked in early and was greeted by a very nice young lady. See gave us a choice of floors two and three, we opted for the third.   The room was set well with two queen beds and each had four smaller pillows, very much to my liking.  The table with two chairs and one occasional chair suited us well as did the refrigerator. They did have in room coffee but that was the one icky thing, not good coffee. The beds were comfortable and the shower while not overly powerful was ok.  Other guests were an annoyance, but were taken care of by the night desk clerk, well done.  What surprises me about most hotels - motels is the fact of no controlling of noise with insulation and sufficient windows and the huge gaps under the hall doors. This place is no different in these areas.  They do offer a decent breakfast in a nice room with plenty of seating and tables. The woman who does the set up and tear down was very sweet so another plus.  So if this location is good for you, give it a try.

Happy nice folks;  Quit decent food and a reasonable price.  If you are in the neighborhood give it a shot.

Have been several times over the years and have found each visit a nice comfortable place to get a decent meal. Good service, good food and right price.

TJMAXX HomeGoods is a fun store to explore and sometimes even purchase things. It seems to be well organized and kept in order as apposed to many stores like it.

Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes 9.49 Served with fresh vegetables and COUNTRY GRAVY...  Ok this is what I ordered, pretty simple order huh.  OH we also ordered a salad at extra cost and to me is was not worth it. I am not a fan of wilted greens mixed in with a few fresh leaves.  Our salads took a little too long to get to us and of course the entree arrived about two minutes later. Look I know this is a casino coffee shop but even they should teach one how to pace ones self in serving.  Now back to the chicken plate. I got two breasts and nothing more, I suspect a lot of folks would be thrilled with this but not me. I dislike breasts and only order fried chicken knowing you usually get some of the dark meat as well. The description says nothing about the offering and if it did I would have opted for something other. But it does say it comes with gravy and of course my potatoes came bare with no offering of gravy or butter. I had to ask for it and that burns my ass since the cook missed it the waitress should have noticed an incomplete plate. And god the veggies were so uninspired; just some stuff sitting on the plate and slightly warm. I know since I have made veggies to be served to the masses and actually made them desirable, it can be done.  This meal truly bugged me, where is my bug spray.  This place is located in the Sunset Station hotel and casino of which I like and we stay here often while driving between Reno and Phoenix.

If you want a person who is willing to listen and investigate your aches and pains this is the guy for you.   I had severe pain in my side to the back. It persisted for more than a year and I went to three internists seeking relief. None listen or cared and wanted to do whatever they wanted to do before addressing my concerns.  Jeffrey Trinka D.C. Listened and was able to give me the relief I was seeking. Dr. Trinka is a large man who is able to embrace a fat old fart like me fully and push and pull you in to shape. So give him a try when you are feeling crooked.

Extended Stay, hmmm not in this life time.  We had our room for two nights. I slept neither of those nights.  The place is not really what you would call dirty, but dingy comes to mind.  The place offers no services, if you want a towel you go and get one, no wake up calls.  The minute we walked in I said, ewww this place smells. Well we got to the room and the ewwww factor went ten fold. IT kind of smelled like a bus full of sweaty people or a dead man rotting in a rice field. The windows stayed open the whole time with little affect. The room was kind of depressing on its own, reminded me of a place derelicts stay in the run down part of town. The bed was so used up it provided no softness or support what so ever.  I think it is safe to say we will not be back.

So we go out to buy a car and visit a bunch of places. It came down to this place and an Exterra or something like that.   Subaru won out by coming in at the price out the door including tax and license that we were willing to pay.  I do not fart around with the back and forth nonsense one usually gets at auto dealerships. I state what I will pay and if they can do it fine, if not, I am out of there. To this point it was going as I wanted.  I wrote a check for the car and off we drive. Two days later they call and say they lost our check, can we give them another. I tell them no, find it. They call again and this time I tell them if I write another check I expect another car. Finally I am in the area so I drop off a check, I just like messing with them. Two more days pass and the sales man who sold us our vehicle calls to ask if we have decided if we want to buy or not. I reminded him that we already bought a car from him. His response is, huh, um, huh, OK and hangs up. A week passes and he again calls to see if we are ready to buy. So once again a reminder is in order. in the week after we got about five letters to remind us they are still there when we decide we are ready to purchase a new car. Not once did they ever say thanks for buying a vehicle, thanks for bringing us another check.  Oh and if we show up for a service appointment they never know who we are. So I wonder if we had just driven the car off of the lot without paying for it, would they have noticed?
