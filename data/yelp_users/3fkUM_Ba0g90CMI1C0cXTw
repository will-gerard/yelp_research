Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the staff at GCC. I have attended PVCC and was very pleased with their young, and passionate professors. I did not experience that at Glendale Community College. I had several professors that used the book and rarely lectured. I had one professor specifically who missed several weeks of class, was on an oxygen tank throughout the semester, and did not allow for a substitute teacher during her week long hospital stay. I felt that the professors did not care about the success of the students, they were simply there for the paycheck and soon retirement.. I would advise anyone to choose any other school besides this one. This is your money and you are entitled to passionate, caring professors and an education that lasts a lifetime.

Wish I could have tried the pizza, unfortunately the bartender told me it was last call and that they had closed the kitchen already when I arrived a few minutes after 1am. I called before I showed up to be sure I could order food and the woman on the phone encouraged me to come in and that they served fried food and pizza until 1:30am. I also checked the menu online and it stated the same thing. So thanks for that.

Great food! I ordered the Carlos carnitas, and there was so much food! It looked like I didn't eat anything when I was done because the portions are so large. Share a meal! My boyfriend ordered the polling fundido and he loved it too. Our waiter served us quickly, food came out super fast! The entire restaurant was quiet and not very busy.
