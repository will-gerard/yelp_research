Can't remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.  Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as "hard rock" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well.   Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters.

Sign says something like 80,000 chicken fried steaks served here, and that's what you need to order. It's that good and it's only $7.50 at lunch.  Get an ice cold Shiner or Lone Star to go with it and sit at the bar if you can, for the view of the kitsch all over the walls, ceiling, and behind the counter.  Service with a smile and you'll be full when you leave.  Parking is kind of a bitch though.

5 years, I've been hittin this Starbucks. Five years.  It has a drive thru- and I get my coffee made the way I like it every time. Going into this store for a drink is fine, but the drive thru moves faster. All the employees are nice and smiley.  It's got plenty of seating, a gigantic patio and even misters. Typically full of work-from-laptop peeps and students and not any loungey type seats except for a few leatherette chairs near the pick up window. The wi-fi always works great for me on the old iPhone.   It's located on a mondo-busy corner, so you might not be cool with making a left turn onto 16th St. out of the parking lot unless you're over-insured. The jay-walking pedestrians and volume of traffic would be difficult to avoid running into.  *Pro tip- avoid between 2:45-4pm unless you want to wait in line behind 50 high school kids, and that's down from 100 kids since Dutch Bros opened nearby.

What? There's something on the northside of Phoenix that reminds me of Brooklyn?   After spending every weekday for several months last summer working out of Greenpoint in Brooklyn, I had gotten used to seeing signs in Polish and eating Polish foods and shopping in Polish grocery stores. I was surprised to walk in to Europa and say "Czesc!" (hello) to the girl behind the counter and get one back!  5 stars because a) this is an unexpected find and b) they carry authentic Polish brands and foods, not the German stuff with Polish labels and c) I got great service.  There's a ton of pastries here and Krakowska ham and my favorite- gypsy bacon. I've only so far had some cold cuts (which were excellent) but I will be back for some sauerkraut, some pierogi and for lunch sometime as well.  It's really great to find these foods in Phoenix.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in PHX. The food is always perfectly cooked and the atmosphere is just my speed, especially when it's a chilly night and the fire is going downstairs. Always have great service and from the looks of the clientele around me, it's a popular place  for date night. Try something with both the red and the green sauce to see which you like better and try a green chile potato as a side. The prime rib is one of the best you'll ever eat.   If nothing else, come in for the fact that you can be seated in one of the handful of basements in Arizona.

Here's what I know...  I went for a happy hour, and got a pint of beer, wings and mozzarella sticks for $12.   No pretentious people allowed here, so it had that going for it. It's almost a dive bar, almost a sports bar, but definitely a great spot to meet a friend or 12 for happy hour and to catch up without a huge crowd or crappy bartenders.   I love places like Brass Rail and wish I had one right down the street from my house.

"The Bistro" as we call it, is right next door to my office. I walk to work every day and this is my breakfast and coffee stop most mornings.   A bagel, English muffin, or a croissant with a breakfast meat of your choosing and some egg and even the dreaded cheese (we have got to stop putting cheese on everything, America) can be yours for about $3.50. And this is a big muffin/bagel.croissant, not a mini-Mickey D's sized meal.   I've had quite a few lunches here as well, and the Veranda Classic on ciabatta and the Chicken Soprano Panini are my #1 & #2 respectively. With fries and a drink, it's about $7.50. Asian Chicken Salad is pretty good, too.  Different menu items show up as a special now & then- one time it was General Tso's chicken with fried rice, a chorizo burrito another. Hot dogs have been spotted at The Bistro.  Everyone here is friendly and now that I'm a regular, Pam makes my coffee for me just as I like it and I don't even have to add my own cream and sugar anymore.   Only open til 3pm and only on weekdays.

Here's the theme of Different Pointe of View- you're there for the view, and you're paying for the view.  Entrees run from $25-$39, and it's completely worth the cost, especially at sunset.  There is an expansive outdoor terrace if you need to be in the open air to take in the panorama from South Mountain to downtown to Squaw Peak and everything in between. After dark, the valley lights up like stars laid out on the desert floor.  The menu is American with some French, Latin and Native American influence. Don't pass up the scallops. They're amazing.  Halibut is also a great pick from the entrees. It was cooked perfectly and the portion size was almost enough to have leftovers.   The wine list is just gratuitous, but you can find some affordable and decent wines by the glass for under $10.  Service was attentive without hovering, and due to the dimly lighted atmosphere, the servers sometimes use a small flashlight when serving your courses and explaining what's on your plate.  Great for a romantic meal, a special occasion, or to bring your out of town guests for drinks and for the view.

There is no bad pizza...  I just moved to Phoenix from Brooklyn, so what do I go for on the first night I'm here? I go for a taste of home. I go for some 'za.  I was on my way to the grocery store, and you should never wander the isles on an empty stomach, and Stumpy's 2 slices + medium drink combo for under $7 did me right.  I asked for pepperoni & sausage, and the guy at the counter asked me if I want crumbled or sliced sausage. They don't usually have a choice at most pizza shops, and if you get asked this question, ALWAYS opt for crumbled.  Pizza is pretty good here and the customer service was amazing. I thought for a second, that I was back at Vinny's in Greenpoint, because of the atmosphere and the friendly people working here.  I have a carryout/delivery menu from Stumpy's but it's nice to dine in or sit outside on a cool evening, too!

It might be Jana's BAKERY but I was here for the stuff in the deli case and I wasn't disappointed.  Alexandra's Pierogies. Jana's has them and you don't have to go to Chicago to get them. If all you know about pierogies is Mrs. T's then you should try some of Alexandra's meat or mushroom ready to make at home pierogies. So damn good. I'll tell you how to make them at home if you need to know. It involves lots of bacon and onions and a cast iron skillet.  Many, many types of good cold cuts (gypsy bacon is my favorite) and I was lucky enough to get a loaf of bread on the house to try with my Polish ham- courtesy of the nice woman who rang me up.  If you are in need of oplatki to celebrate Christmas with, I'll bet they could find you some.

Baja and anything ending in "Berto's" are about the same, except Baja is more expensive, with a much smaller menu and probably a bit healthier and definitely fresher.  Fish tacos rock it, so does the carne asada and the Baja salsa looks like coffee grounds or lava but it tastes amazing with a totopo de maiz.

Simple and easy to use. If you've never used an off-site airport parking facility, don't harbor the erroneous notion that they are less convenient. You get dropped off right in front of your terminal minutes after you leave the lot and your car is in a secure location less than 2 miles from the airport. When you return to Phoenix, it's just as easy to spot one of their shuttles to return to your car. I have used Sky Harbor Airport Parking several times, and paid between $6-7 per day for uncovered parking versus $9 at the airport lots.

I showed up a couple of Saturdays ago for the Camel & Ostrich races and it was good times. The crowd- very diverse. People from all walks of life, all ages, and from all over the valley. $2 draft beers, shade, and music made it kind of a party atmosphere, a little like Spring Break at Daytona Beach. I don't live that life every day but I do enjoy it in moderation so I was all smiles. I didn't win any $$ but I was hella entertained and the views from the grandstand are pretty awesome on a sunny afternoon. $2 admission, free parking and as long as you don't have a legit gambling problem, this is a pretty affordable day for what you get.

I live nearby, but this is pretty much my favorite place to be in Scottsdale. The entertainment, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere and the scenery combine to bring you a great place to chill, have fun, people watch and escape from the AZ heat. It looks especially amazing after dark.  You can see scantily clad Flamenco dancers, listen to some Gypsy music from Basque country, have a big plate of ceviche for $12, drink a mojito, lie down in a comfortable cabana by the water, and slide down a waterslide into a plunge pool. You can also dine on sushi, southwest or Italian cuisine and take a gondola ride while being serenaded by an opera-singing gondolier.   The summer rates here are nearly half-off the prices you'd pay from mid-September on, so that value can't be beat. Not a better place to have your out of town guests stay with their families- there are more pools here than you'd find at any other nearby resort, and there are activities for all ages. The sandy beach is great for toddlers.  Free parking on site and even if you're not a guest, you'll be treated like family, but unfortunately, you can't swim in the pools if you don't have a room key.

And you can *rent* a firearm to fire?   I loved the cleanliness, the size of the facility and the electric-motored targets. The lanes are, however, pretty tightly packed in here. I didn't see anything to police up my brass into- just a big rubber squeegie to push it around. I like to clean as I shoot so as not to step all over casings as I'm squeezing off rounds, so that was my only bitch about the lanes.  If it's firearm/LEO/military related and you need it...I think it's here. This is the only place I'll shoot in the Valley unless you show me something that's just wayyyyy better. Go for it.

Tailgaters is still a "wings n beer sports bar".  They've tweaked their image and offerings lately and while the bar food remains, they've added a ton of craft beers to their taps and fridges.  The crowd hasn't changed a whole lot- still very blue collar and a wide range of ages- and the decor is mostly the same as it has been the past few years. It's a comfortable, lively place where you can have a good drink and you'll have room to invite a few friends along.   Live music on the weekends and the wings are pretty damn good. The staff are real friendly and welcoming.

Rating is for the store- not the products and definitely NOT the coverage!  This can be a damn busy store! The staff do their best with the wait list and they encourage making an appointment ahead of time.  They do their work exceptionally fast and turned me around in less than ten minutes when I needed to activate a new phone and move contacts from my old phone to the new one.   While most nearby businesses close at 9, they lock the doors at 8, so don't let that throw you.

So, you get one of their "World Tour of Beer" cards (free) and it entitles you to some perks, one of which is half-priced pizza on Thursday nights.  While I do have very broad shoulders, I'm not from Chicago and I don't care how authentic it is, but I love their deep dish pies. The crust is crispy and doughy and the toppings are slightly charred by the time the pizza bakes. Big fan of the fresh garlic and their sausage, too.   Their happy hour is not bad- it goes til 7 and you get about a buck off of pints. The crowd is mostly blue-collar in the huge bar area, but service is a little slow when they are busy. I'd call it "comfy" in the bar. The bartender cranks out the drinks and beers though, so don't expect her to be able to engage you in a lot of conversation. If you like to play some trivia games while you sit at the bar, they have the electronic version as well as a hosted version.

I don't know why I waited almost three years to try Tokyo Lobby. I've driven past it a hundred times and from Bell Road, it doesn't look like much. It's in a Walmart parking lot, next to a Payless, for f*cks sake!  BUT! It's a good thing I decided to blow off existing reservations elsewhere to drop in on a rainy Friday night because I was truly impressed with the rolls, the nigiri, and the udon here.  For a small dining area, they do pack in the tables and it's bigger inside than it looks outside. There are two outdoor patios but I'll be sitting at the sushi bar from now on.   The two chairs in the middle of the bar were all that was available when my lady love and I arrived, so we got seated right away and asked the server to bring us two Kirin sake bombers- the intelligent way to begin any sushi meal on the west side.  I made sure to order a few rolls to try as well as some of my personal favorite nigiri- the tako AKA octupus. One of the best servings of tako I've had in Arizona. It was garnished with super-thinly sliced lemon on each of the two pieces of octopus tentacle and it was so tender and not gristly or rubbery as I've had elsewhere. I immediately asked for another order.  The specialty rolls were really well put together, with lots of fresh fish and interesting combinations of sweet, savory, salty and sour from the various sauces and ingredients. Textures- crunch and bite and melt in your mouth- are well thought out in the various house rolls.  About halfway through dinner, I got to speak some with the sushi chef about the day's special on a sign behind him "blue fin tuna- $5.99 sushi, $14.99 sashimi" and he mentioned that he "only gets the good stuff" from his supplier. Looking at it in his window at the sushi bar, it was that deep red color you hope for in a piece of good tuna and it did not disappoint when he handed it to me on a plate. Garnished with wasabi, he tells us "one bite" and there it goes, no soy sauce, either. Damn good.   I wanted more nigiri and he prepped some flounder and yellowtail belly for us. The texture of the flounder was like butter- owing to the way he sliced the filet and the yellowtail belly was wrapped around some julienned vegetables and herbs and topped with a raw quail egg. Again, he says "one bite" and it was outstanding.   I had to try an udon so I opted for the tempura udon which is accompanied by tempura veggies and a shrimp. I love anything with a complex broth and noodles and I was in love with this bowl of deliciousness. They even brought out some togorashi for me as seasoning.  I've eaten a lot of sushi in a lot of places including Michelin star restaurants in New York and California and I would pull up a chair for an omakase at Tokyo Lobby any time. I don't think there'd be fugu or toro but I know I'd get an incredibly memorable meal.

For the same amount of coin, I'd take some ghetto Chinese over a bowl at Samurai Sam's.  This is obviously healthier than Chinese, there's no doubt. The Sumo Bowl ($10!) I ordered had better quality meats and vegetables than you'd find at a Chinese take out. Tasty, however, it was not.  The ingredients were not seasoned enough for my tastes, and I did all I could to add some flavor. I added some soy sauce, Japanese red pepper and salt & pepper. Adding these after cooking proved pointless and I kind of suffered through the meal instead of enjoying it.   Perhaps there's some sauce that I forgot to ask for, which will render the Sumo Bowl less healthy in exchange for deliciousness?

The patio is always crowded, even when it's 115 degrees outside. It's crowded because every seat inside the restaurant is taken. They have misters out there, but they don't really work too well.   What is it then, that convinces throngs of West siders to endure the blasting heat and sun beating down on them?  A $3.25 margarita that tastes great and will knock you on your ass.

Fast service and a really good bagel. The breakfast special (bagel sandwich with a coffee or drink) will take care of you on your way to work when you oversleep and can't get it together at home on a Monday morning. Bagels are huge and delicious.   Not a whole lot of room inside for a leisurely breakfast in the mornings so a better option for grab & go. Boar's Head meats for your sandwiches, too, so you could call ahead and order something for lunch. My dry cleaners is right next door and it's right off of the 101, so I'll be in for breakfast most Monday mornings when I am running late.

If you're into craft or international beers, they stock a ton of them. The line at the deli counter is no joke- take a number right away and you may have to wait awhile. This is a nice spot to grab lunch and sit outside on their big patio with the free wifi. Lots of yoga pants here. I'd like to meet the people who stack the fruit perfectly in their produce section. I'll bet they're amazing at Jenga.

I give this hospital no stars. If lil Jr. comes in to the ER with a mild cough and you show up 5 minutes later, in obvious pain and discomfort then guess what- you're going to sit and suffer while the kid who could be treated at home with a slathering of Vick's Vap-O-Rub is seen before you.  The billing department is also a shit show- set up a payment plan, pay on time and then be treated to multiple phone calls claiming they're about to send your account to collections and shaking you down for the money.  The best that could happen to Arrowhead Hospital would be a total evacuation of all human, canine and feline life to a minimum safe distance, followed by an expert firebombing and razing.  It's the North Korea of so-called healthcare.

I will seek out a Trader Joe's no matter where I am. This particular store is not my favorite TJs in the Valley (the one at Tatum & Shea is) but they sell the same great products and have the same type of helpful and fun staff working the aisles and the registers.  Things you shouldn't be without in your freezer-  Edamame Spinach Broccoli Gyoza Mandarin Orange Chicken Fried Rice  You will find great tasting versions of all of the above in the frozen section at TJs.  Their Mediterranean Hummus is a game changer. You can't find a better hummus at any store.

This is my neighborhood spot for a haircut and beard trim and they are open Sundays, too, which is a friggin' winner as far as convenience. I could pay half the price at a Hair Cuttery BUT John is a pro and you get what you pay for in this life. So when my $19 razor cut looks as sharp as sh*t,  I know the value of a great barber like John.

Like Randy Jackson used to say "it was kinda pitchy, dawg. It was just a'ight for me." There's no such thing as bad pizza, but there's a lot of mediocre and HH falls into that category.  This is a bunch of pre-fab and frozen ingredients, hoisted onto pre-fab dough, to be baked and served up as a notch above bowling alley 'za. Luckily, it is priced accordingly.  Cheap, fast, convenient, but not at all exceptional. However, if you have one of their frequently mailed out coupons, I don't think there's a better value when you need to feed 12 kids.

It's a good mixed crowd at a bar with plenty of room to hang out. I'd prefer more single ladies to ogle but that's Peoria for ya AKA everyone is married. A few pool tables, some places to lounge, pretty cocktail servers and everyone from the local Harley riders and quad riding/hunting crowd to a few old timers and a smattering of douchebags drinks here.  Decent drink prices and the bar snacks are really good (specifically the baked pretzel sticks). The later you arrive, the more fun you will have.

Totally underestimated food- everything I've tried has been great. You cannot beat the value. If you went across the street to Pita Jungle to have a very similar meal, you'd pay about 20% more per order.  There's an open kitchen and everything is made fresh right in plain sight. Their food is always well seasoned and it's pretty healthy for a fast-casual place. Order yourself some Falafel while you await your salad or entree and ask for extra dipping sauce for it.  They do close at 8, the CFL lighting is not at all cozy and it gets really busy for dinner, however the food and service are so good that I don't mind. Greek Wraps feels like a family business and they really seem to care that you're having a good meal and that you'll come back for more.

This review should be read aloud in the voice of my dad, which means a combination of Foghorn Leghorn and Tommy Lee Jones.  Q: do you like fried chicken?   If you answered "yes" proceed to Lo-Lo's.   If you answered "no",  then what in the hell is wrong with you?   Seriously, go get a chicken leg from anywhere else that sells chicken legs.   Go on. I'll wait.  Now, look at the chicken leg that you just brought over here to me and compare it to...  THIS BIG-ASS MONSTROUS LEG FROM A REAL CHICKEN THAT THEY ARE GONNA SERVE YOU AT LO-LO's!  Not only is this leg three times bigger than that lil ole scrawny bantam leg you got, but it's ten times as juicy and tastes like the good Lord done blessed whatever chicken it came from with the most delicious chicken genes he could find!   Chicken so good you'll wanna take the bones home with you and suck on 'em later just to reminisce about how good that chicken was.

At $14.50...a basic wash is not cheap! However, they are thorough as hell with the interior so there's good value. It's an "upsell" car wash, so expect the customary pitch to interior shampoo/detail interior & exterior, etc.

You're tired. It was a long day at work and you forgot to start the dishwasher this morning. You dig into your wallet and find a $20 bill. Can you feed three people for that without "driving thru" some fast food joint?  Yeah, you can. And you'll have leftovers, too.  Order the "dinner for 3" and you will bring home egg drop soup, fried wontons, eggrolls, moo goo gai pan, sweet & sour pork and beef with broccoli for everyone's face. If you want to modify the beef with broccoli to, say, Mongolian beef, that's a dollar more.   Your dinner comes with all the soy sauce/hot mustard/sweet & sour/duck sauce that you'll need and a big ass egg-fried rice.   Carry it home in the handy box they provide for you (no spilling) and enjoy.

On a crisp fall evening in Phoenix (which means 60 degrees) you can smell the wood fires burning on the expansive patio as the valet takes your keys.  This was a dinner for 4 and a birthday celebration for a 12 year old. Right away, the staff made our birthday guest feel special with her preference of seating (table 4- indoors with sunset views) and a birthday card from the restaurant. Our server, I think her name was Dolores, spoke with a French accent, which made the birthday experience even fatter for a 12 year old girl who had never climbed past Olive Garden fancy up til tonight. Dolores(?) answered all the questions the 2 younger guests had, such as what's Jidori mean? What is foie gras? And is pork belly really just bacon?  We started off the meal with the complimentary bread basket (chile corn bread, and the most awesome ancho flatbread) and some calamari. Calamari is supposed to be tender and not rubbery and this was perfectly cooked.  The menu changes seasonally at Lon's and we all decided that we were going to go for something hearty, so it was sea bass, pork duo and the Jidori chicken. Our server said the chicken was a half-bird, so two of us split that entree (which the staff accomplished at our table without a sidewards glance) and because the goat cheese mac n cheese is a requirement here, we ordered a side of that.   With 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer and 3 entrees, I spent $165 including the tip.  The patrons at Lon's are mostly an older crowd, but it's a classy place with really delicious food and great service and a rustic atmosphere. Perfect spot for a special occasion in Paradise Valley.

I imagine it would be tough to work at the Willow Stream Spa.   "Hey, Jason! The waterfall massage pool is for spa guests only! Get back to work!"  Sorry, boss. It's 95 degrees warm in there and my shoulders need some TLC. At least I'm not bent over under the cascade of H2O like one of the Kardashians massaging my lower back & booty.  "Jason! You can't be in the rooftop pool right now, you have to teach one of those yoga classes where the participants dangle from elastic curtains suspended from the ceiling!"  Sorry, boss. I feel like a high roller just looking at this pool and cabanas, surrounded by palm trees and clear blue sky, I had to take me a dip.  Are all spas this good looking and glamorously appointed? The men's locker room has zero-gravity lounges and an HDTV. A far cry from my local YMCA.  I think this may be among the most peaceful and relaxing places I've ever been to and if you book a Gold Club room, it's included with your stay at The Princess.

In Atlantic City this would be a solid 4 stars, believe it or not. However, compared to what's happening south of the Riviera on The Strip right now, meh.  There are a couple of things to note on the good side-  the slots are never crowded and neither are the table games the crowd here is as unpretentious as you can get  the history of the resort is hard to match- Dino used to be a part owner and Liberace was the headliner here shortly after the doors opened for the first time. Frank Sinatra had one of the rooms in the Monte Carlo Tower remodeled to meet his tastes during one of his runs. There are a few exhibits of the heyday of the Riviera near the Monaco Tower including a great photo of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis onstage together. rooms are cheap Peppermill is right next door  On the bad side- it's dated inside...from the way it's decorated to the way it's operated unless you can appreciate "Old Vegas" you won't think you are getting the Vegas experience here  Some new developments are underway nearby which may force the Riv to update and upgrade in order to stay relevant. For now, they are firmly in the 70s & 80s in terms of style and it's not even good enough for hipster irony right now.

Dive bar. Through and through.   Pool table, dimly lighted, sports on the TVs, smoke-filled, near the airport. Zero "bro vibe". Anton Chigurh would have a drink here.   A great selection of bottles and on tap. Dogfish Head, Brooklyn Lager, and of course fireball shots. There's even a pass-thru window so you can order food from the pizza shop next door (the pie is really, really good).   Bartender Cory was great. I'd be a regular if I lived nearby.

The food is as good as everyone says it is...it's just another level here. Guacamole is a must- with the seasonal pomegranate seeds or without. Order the Cochinita Pibil and experience what Mexican food is like without a ton of yellow cheese melted on top of it. Enjoy the gorgeous art on the walls inside and outside of the restaurant.

I'm giving it 4 stars because they have the balls to hang on to the outrageous interior with the neon lights and the mirrors and the purple/pink/blue/black color scheme. Also because they serve a delicious 16 ounce bone-in ham steak. They throw it on the grill to give it some char and it kills anything you'd get at IHOP or Denny's.   I guarantee you won't see waitresses in Von Trapp family costumes and cocktail servers in black prom dresses back home, noble tourist. You won't be able to wait for your breakfast table while drinking a tequila sunrise and seated in a smoky lounge on a red velour sofa in front of a small lake of fire, either. You can even cure a hangover here.  If you want a taste of "old Vegas" at breakfast, just go.

Listen, you have to suspend a little bit of disbelief to enjoy Chino, OK?   It's not the most stylish or the cleanest looking restaurant you've ever seen. The tables are the same portable kind that you'd register to vote on or lay out your wares at a yard sale and the chairs are like a school cafeteria. You pour your own drinks at the fountain and the napkins are in a wall-mounted dispenser and you pick up your plastic utensils from a bin next to the drink lids and condiment packets. All of the above fits the neighborhood at 19th Ave & Greenway perfectly. There's a trailer park across the street, just south of a horse racing track, know what I'm sayin?   Enjoy the taste of your food despite your surroundings, right?  Imagine combining the greatest hits of what most Americans know of Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican cuisines, make it affordable along with totally customizable and that's the essence of the concept at Chino.   I really, really, really like it. I think it is perfectly unpretentious and works great as:  +a lunch stop with co-workers +a takeout joint at the end of a busy day +a family restaurant +a place where you know there'll be something for everyone +a hangover cure  They make one of the greatest snickerdoodles in the world, too.  You will be overwhelmed your first visit, so take your time (seriously, ten or 15 minutes) and ask for a sample of whatever you're considering.

I seem to find a rare copy of an out of print hardcover book for my home library every time I'm here. Not a mint condition "Love In The Time of Cholera" or anything, but still.   If you want to kill some time, just go inside and browse. No one will bust your balls for reading while you look around.  If you need music or movies or stuff to sit on a shelf and collect dust, they have that, too.

I have said previously that OBR might be my favorite bar in Phoenix, but this is now my true fave. It's small, it's not full of TVs, and I want to steal the jukebox.  Not exactly a place I would recommend for drinking cheap beer- although you can do that here- this is where you should go for an excellently made drink like a tall Moscow Mule or an Old Fashioned while you engage in some friendly or romantic conversation or chill the f*ck out.   There's swanky banquette seating near the pool tables, a small outdoor patio and comfy bar stools.   The real draw here is the attention to detail with which the drinks are made for you. I wish I lived closer.

"Is this your first time here?" she asked in her cute, lilac-haired voice. "Yes it is" was my reply. "Let me buy you a pastry!" she declared as I glared at all of her sweetness, from top to bottom. She had gooey, sticky, and no doubt very, very sweet things to offer and it was all made right behind the counter in her open kitchen. Pointing to the high-rise layer cake on display I asked her "is that real?". "Heck yeah it is, it's a peach cake.". I didn't want to be an obvious glutton so I opted for the banana and walnut bread and ordered a blended coffee- both of which I was very satisfied with. Will I always stop by when I'm on 7th ave from now on? Heck yeah.

I have been out to a lot of Thai restaurants in DC, NYC and LA and I am happy that I found Touch of Thai. Located in a non-descript strip mall in North Phoenix, it has a really good menu full of the basics (not a lot of surprises to be found on it), very well prepared food and everything seemed fresh- an example being that the spring rolls tasted house-made and not frozen.   The yellow curry was great. It wasn't too hot but the flavors of a Thai curry are definitely spicy. Next time I'm here I'll try the red, green or Panang curry.  The chairs in the dining room- a little uncomfortable for a lengthy dinner with friends and a few Singhas. The booths looked to be more plush but definitely a tight squeeze for those seated beside one another. Lots of thigh-touch possible- as in your outer thigh touching your seat mate's outer thigh. Perhaps the inspiration behind the restaurant's name?   Service was good, but on the slow side. The house-made coconut ice cream made me wish I could buy a pint to take home.  At 6:30 on a Saturday night, there were maybe 3 other tables in the small dining room. Half an hour later, there were 6-8 people waiting for a table.  If you have friends who are afraid of Thai food, you could start them off here and they'd find plenty of mild/pretty-close-to-Chinese food choices for a meal. Vegetarians also have a multitude of options. Prices are very reasonable.

I've dined here twice for dinner and once for lunch and I can't think of a reason that I won't be here once a month.  I'm a Greek food lover and I can't pass up a Gyro stand, either. Hell, I've even been to Greece. Problem with that is, that I'm stuck in a rut because I know what I like and I always ask for it whenever I try out a new taverna.  The things that you cannot go wrong with here: Horiatiki (salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, Kalamata olives, red onion and feta), Tzatziki (yogurt, garlic and cucumber dip with some of the best warmed pita bread you'll ever eat) the Avgolemono soup and any entree with "George" in its name.   Friendly service, it's never crowded and it's very affordable.

If you're afraid of a sticky floor, or domestic beers, or leather couches, this is not the venue for you. However, if you're not a princess, and you like to play pool, listen to some Classic Rock on the jukebox and try to punch a speed bag whilst enjoying a $3 dollar beer...then welcome, my friend.  My very fun co-workers and I took over the lounge area on the left side as you walk into the courtyard. The staff were all great, even though we kept their arses hustlin' beers over to us from across the way. We took all the leather couches and rearranged them into our own living room the way we wanted to and they couldn't have cared less.  If you're here on a Friday after lunch and you hear some rowdiness coming from the pool tables...that'll be us.

If you think there's some stigma associated with shopping here, eff you. You're not royalty so zip it. That being said, Tweekerville is nearby so you will be shopping with Tweekers at this store.  A simple economic lesson-   12 ounces in a can .60 cents per can in the office vending machine 33.814 ounces in a liter 2 liters = 67.628 ounces    .99 cents per 2 liter Pepsi product at 99 Cents Only  And while you're saving $$ on drinks for the brainstorming session, get some ramen (.29cents) some hot sauce (.99), salad dressing (.99), and a Nestle Crunch (.59) to stock your snack drawer with.  Don't spend money on things that YOU KNOW should logically cost more than a dollar and you'll be fine. You really think those earbuds you paid $1 for are gonna sound good?

There are many reasons why I love this restaurant, so I'll share with you my "Top 5 Reasons You Should Dine At Fuego".  5. The place is f*cking charming as a mo-fo. If you want a romantic setting for date night, sit in the art gallery near the piano. If you want to dance after dark, sit outside on the hacienda style patio under the misters and shake your hips to the live band. If you want to get schwasted via craft cocktails, sit inside near the bar so your drinks won't have far to travel, thus arriving in your hand quicker from round to round.   4. It is locally-owned and operated by a staff that really knows how to make you feel welcome and appreciated. I've been here at least a half dozen times, over the course of the past 5 years, and see some of the same smiling staff members in the dining room and in the kitchen during that period of time. Everyone is gracious, everyone is pleasant, everyone is accommodating.  3. The crowd is a swath of humanity. Old folks, young folks, families with little kids, couples on date night, girlfriends meeting up to share a bottle of wine- there's a little bit of everyone dining and drinking at Fuego. You can't help but feel comfortable.   2. Latin-inspired food that looks and tastes like it's made from scratch. This is not a Mexican restaurant, even though some of the dishes are Mexican-inspired and feature common ingredients from that cuisine, so don't get it twisted. Empanadas, quesadillas, enchiladas, rellenos, TACOS (but tacos are only for lunch or happy hour). All excellent and anything including pernil will set you up for happiness. Get the cornbread as a side and perpare to make an "oh damn" face as you bite into it. You ever go to a restaurant and ignore the server schpiel about the specials? Don't ever do that here. Listen and take notes because you'll probably want to order one. Unless you are a vegan or a vegetarian because the specials always seem to star a meat of some sort. Also of note- the servers always tell you the price of the specials. I can't stand it when that important info is missing but it's always included at Fuego. My favorite steak besides the steaks coming off of my grill at home are served here. Don't pass up the ribeye!  1. Happy Hour. It's called Social Hour at Fuego and it offers discounts on drinks and appetizers that are hard to beat. You could show up with a few friends and do a tapas style dinner for not a lot of ca$h with $4 beers or $6 wine glasses. That would also afford you a chance to try a lot of the food to see what you might want to go steady with as an entree sometime.   It's not the cheapest restaurant (dinner entrees are all $25-$30 give or take a buck) but you'll enjoy every bite of your meal and you'll have impeccable service and probably have leftovers. With a few new drinking and dining establishments opening nearby, I imagine Fuego will only get busier.

There is definitely a cluster of good Korean restaurants in metro PHX and they're on the West Side, people.   Growing up and living in the Washington, DC area gave me ample choices for Korean restaurants and bars. If you ever find yourself in Annandale, Virginia, you'll be in the center of some of the best Korean food outside of Seoul. I've dined on Korean fare enough to know what's good and OHYA reminds me of those Korean barbecue spots from back east. You can fire up the tabletop grill and cook your food yourself or have the kitchen add fire to your beef, pork, seafood, chicken or pork belly. I singled out pork belly because you should definitely order some and you should cook it yourself so you can get it as crisp as you like. Or not crisp at all.  The side dishes that accompany a meal- AKA panchan/banchan are pretty good, although they are more on the sweet side and not as hot & spicy as the deep red color of the kimchi might convey. The cucumber kimchi is my favorite but I'll also ask for seconds of the sprouts dressed in sesame oil.  This is also a great spot for sushi and they have $5 Kirin sake bombers all day.   I noticed two private karaoke rooms so if you feel like partying with a group of friends, here would be a good location to try your vocals out. The one Friday night I was here there were multiple karaoke parties going on and every once in a while when the door would open for a cocktail order to be delivered from the bar, the sound of a cat being strangled with a wire coat hanger over the beat of an 80's power ballad would emanate from within.   Clientele was mixed and you won't feel like you're an outsider if you're not familiar with Korean food or customs. Wait staff will gladly answer questions and guide you along your way.  Korean cuisine is outasight and if you haven't tried some or you've been searching the valley for a spot to enjoy it, head over to OHYA.

So, the prices are a little higher on most items in the store. The trade-off is that you can ask anyone who works here where to find something, and they will walk with you to the item's location. They'll also ask if they can help you look up some obscure part number for your sprinkler system. The girls working the registers are always friendly and helpful, too.  If you need a key made or some paint matched or something for your yard or a tool, Ace is so much more convenient and well organized than warehouse stores are and the service just wins.

Ask for Stan. He's speedy without being at all sloppy, and he pays great attention to detail. He'll ask you what you want and stop before it's too late to make sure things are going the way you want them to go.  Best time to get a haircut is late morning or around 4pm Monday- Thursday. Hardly ever a wait at those times.   Friendly service and they take plastic.

Maybe I wouldn't know about Hobe Meats (pronounced Hoe-bee Meets) if I didn't work nearby or enjoy the occasional Groupon, but I'm glad I know.  Since last year, they've added a fresh coat of paint to the place, brightened it up and added a few more items to the freezer of exotic meats.   The thing to buy here is beef. I'll gladly pay $120 for a 3 bone prime grade standing rib roast because when you taste the difference between this and what you get at your grocery store, you know where the extra money went. Same goes for the ribeyes.    This is the only place in the whole damn state of Arizona that sells chopped cherry peppers for sammiches, too and I have missed those since I left home to move here almost two years ago.

I lived at Bella Vista from April 2011-12. It was a great choice for me because I could walk to work and be in my office in 5 minutes.   I had a one bedroom first floor apartment and it was an upgraded unit on the south side of the community facing east so I paid a premium for rent. I was close to the south pool and I usually had it all to myself. There are gas grills near the north end of the complex and charcoal grills all over the south side. The north side pool is heated and there's an adjacent hot tub. The community gym- while small- is well equipped and not at all crowded. Storage space was ample and I never had any issues with maintenance, scorpions or other pests.  The leasing process was simple- I applied online and paid my deposits online. I also paid my monthly rent through the myequityapartment website. That made life convenient and I never had an issue using it.  The only con about Bella Vista was the noisy neighbor I had upstairs, but she was nice and friendly at least. She also had loud sex sometimes, which was entertaining.  Spring and her office staff are great. I don't know what the previous reviewer was doing when dealing with them, but I never had any issues remotely similar.   The location is ten minutes from everywhere and safe and close to the conveniences that you need (groceries, gas, restaurants, freeways, etc.).

One of the best lunches I've had in Phoenix.  I'm still thinking about the fried egg sandwich and fries. A fried egg- yolk just barely runny. Barely. Two thick-ass slabs of good-ass, smoky-ass bacon. Arugula and aioli on a really tasty ass bun. Damn, son. Good as hell. The french fries were so damn good, too, and you have to dip those in the remoulade to really enjoy them all the way.   I would come back for this sammich every day if I lived next door. Don't be afraid of it being called a fried egg sammich, because it's a whole nother level.

Flew out of Mesa-Gateway on Allegiant last month. This is the only reason I would be at an airport this far east of where I live.   So, it's not convenient to get to (good luck roping a friend or relative into driving you here, as it's about a 2 hour round trip haul from downtown Phoenix and shuttles cost a $kullcrack) but if you drive yourself, the long term parking is butt-cheap.   It's an  airport w/o jetways, so you'll be walking out onto the tarmac to board your flight. As many have stated- if you fly Allegiant and you don't pony up for all the extras such as priority boarding, you need to get here at least an hour and a half before your flight takes off. No bullshit- it's that kind of deal w/o priority boarding and even if you pay for priority boarding you're SOL if you arrive less than 45 mins before takeoff because you're just grouped in with everyone else, fighting for a seat, and say goodbye to the extra coin you dropped for priority.   It's a nice and new and neat facility, but they could use some better signage for where to go to board your flight once you go through the TSA checkpoint. Luckily it's a small airport so trial & error in finding your boarding location don't take long.  Is it ok for me to call this a necessary evil?

Sometimes the inside of a Circle K can look like the first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan". However, not so with this store.  The morning crew is awesome- I pass up about 5 other Circle K stores to come to this specific location in Moon Valley because of them.   The store is always clean, they do not make anyone wait to pay for their stuff, and the staff seem to enjoy what they do.

Pro: good onion rings  Cons: bland burger           subpar service  I'm hoping this was an aberration, because I have heard good things about this Lenny's location.   As I pulled up to the drive thru and heard "be with you in a moment" followed by 2 minutes of silence, then after I yelled "YO!" at the talk box got a response from another employee and finally 2 more minutes later pulled up to the window. It took me almost ten minutes of waiting to get my drive thru meal. Girl with the drive thru mic boom on seemed more into eating and texting than serving this paying customer. Kinda seemed like a place where they'd spit in your food, honestly.  If I am going to wait ten minutes, I'm taking my drive thru bidness to In N Out or I'm going to walk into Smashburger or Five Guys where the food and service are both far superior.

I dine here for breakfast/brunch only and only on weekends. There's always a wait for a table but it doesn't last for too long.  You can go healthy (fruit bowl and some oatmeal) but there's not a lot of fun in that, is there? You can do healthy at home. Be a man, ladies, and order one of the ginormous breakfast platters. I'll split it with you.  Ample portions like Sofia Vergara in a tube top, y'all. Your plate is about as big around as a steering wheel and there's no vacancy on it.   They make a damn good chicken-fried steak and there's enough of it to share. If you order the "Big Foot" version, there's enough to feed two adults with leftovers. It comes with a few eggs cooked to order, hash browns and biscuits. The biscuits are made in house and they are quite remarkable. The omelets are also huge and delicious. The hot sauce on your table goes well with eggs.   Ask to be seated in Molly's section if it's possible. If she doesn't love her job, she's awesome at faking it.

I was invited to a Robatayaki tasting presentation, which was my first visit to Roka Akor.   From the reviews I had read, I knew the restaurant was about more than just sushi, and I was really impressed by the sight of the kitchen staff building a charcoal fire in the open kitchen (flames, sparks and the whole nine). The invite literature mentioned "prime cuts of lamb and beef steak grilled over a charcoal flame" so everyone in my party was looking forward to trying those proteins "Robata style".  Cold sake while I wait at the bar for my peeps to assemble? Right on.   We were all seated at the comfortable and impressive sushi bar with a clear view of the chefs at work at their stations. Say hello to a bowl of edamame, everybody! Various things were being grilled, sliced, prepared with steam, stacked into ceramic vessels with rocks and shells and ice and other garnishes. No plate left a chef's hands without being visually attractive.   I thought the abalone mushroom could have passed for actual abalone, and with the way it was sliced and grilled, you could fool a good portion of the public into believing that it's some sort of seafood. Especially when it's garnished with pea-sized salmon eggs. One of my group is not such a great fan of foods that once swam, so he was disappointed in the salmon eggs, salmon tataki and the diver scallops we were offered. The scallops were on the rare side, and one of us (not me) remarked that they were a lil too gooey inside for her. I didn't mind, because they were grilled and seared on the outside and dabbed with a lil bit of wasabi-lime-green apple sauce.    There were small cubes of pork belly that were juicy and fatty and grilled perfectly with just the right amount of char on them to enhance the natural flavors of what is essentially uncured bacon. Powerful tasty.  Niman Ranch Strip Loin came my way sliced and looking a perfect medium rare. It was seasoned with a little sea salt and had a robust beef flavor and a buttery texture. I could have eaten another small plate of it, easy, and if I had really wanted to, no-seafood dude is also well-done dude so his steak was available because it wasn't done enough for him.  I was not a huge fan of the Duck Confit and Foie Gras Rice Hotpot with Perigord Truffle. In my humble opinion it did not stand up to the previous courses. It looked and tasted a bit like a hash I might make with a leftover skin-on chicken thigh and some sticky rice. It was definitely made with upscale ingredients (truffles and foie gras) but it didn't taste decadent enough to match the description.    Perhaps the most talked about and enjoyed item were Brussels Sprouts. Described as "Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Japanese Mustard", they were phenomenal. The sprouts were quick fried to a crispy brown on the outside and Japanese Mustard needs to be a standard condiment everywhere.  The dessert course was an "Orange Blossom Honey Chawanmushi w/ Strawberry & Lime Foam". All you need to know about that is in the name, and that Chawanmushi is an egg custard and sorta like soft-serve ice cream.  I tried a Latour Chardonnay and a South African Pinotage with dinner and I'm now a fan of both.    Service was impeccable. Their staff should train everyone else how to present and remove and refill. I enjoyed letting the chefs at Roka Akor take over and the rest of my group did as well. Except for that one guy who doesn't like seafood or anything less than well done steak. He had to stop for a hot dog at a gas station on his way home.

I am not sure if this particular location is on the list of F&E stores to get the axe, but I damn sure hope not.  My Greatest Hits: *Greek Yogurt w/honey *The 12oz. cold cut package- $6 *16oz marinated mushrooms- $5 *pita chips *hummus *thai style shrimp *marinated flat iron steak *when avocados are on sale for .50 cents

This is my go-to supermarket on the West Side. I regularly buy groceries here and I have also gone home with pool supplies and patio furniture from the Marketplace section.   The employees are mostly invisible but they will ask you if you need help finding something the moment you look a little clueless. The store is clean and laid out in an easy to navigate arrangement of aisles and products. The cashiers are all business and don't mess around with small talk when you line up in front of their respective conveyor belts.  The bakery, deli, and produce section sometimes fall behind in terms of being freshly stocked. The butcher and seafood counters get real busy after work, too, thanks to this area being more suburban and most folks in this part of town working a 9 to 5.   The kids smoking meth outside at night aren't to be blamed on the store, and neither is the atrocious layout of the parking lot.   I prefer Fry's to the other supermarkets in the Valley, even over Safeway, which I have patronized for 30 years because I feel I get similar quality without paying too much dough for it.

Is "California Cool" a brand? I think so, and I think In-N-Out personifies it better than any store in the mall selling overpriced clothing in Euro sizes.  Fresh ingredients including never frozen beef, and fries that are made after you order them. Pretty cheap pricing. Friendly service. Spotlessly clean. A secret menu adding intrigue to the ordinary.  So, what happens if you ask for your burger Gangnam Style?

Whatever kind of trail you like, it's here. While everyone else is crowding Piestewa and Echo Canyon and North Mountain, you have plenty of parking and your choice of straight up, level elevation or anything in between hikes. There are a few ramadas for hanging out, which makes the weekends busier with more than just hikers.   The trails are pretty well maintained and mostly free of litter. You'll see lots of cacti, chaparral and some snakes, lizards and lots of dogs on leashes. Arrowhead Point or Sunrise Trail will take you up so you can see from Univ of Phoenix Stadium to downtown Phoenix. One of the few hikes south of the Rim in AZ which afford you a water view- thanks to my neighbors down in Arrowhead Lakes.    I'd like to get a better pair of hiking shoes and take on some of the steeper trails from time to time. As always- bring plenty of water (some of the round trips on the roundabout trails will cover over 3 miles) and dress in layers if it is cool out.

I used to live about a fifteen minute walk away from the famous Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Heights. It was a little bit of a tourist trap, because everyone knew about it thanks to TV shows, magazines and the "Best Pizza In America" award. I went 1 for 5 in my attempts to get in that line down under the Brooklyn Bridge, and the one time I did manage to make it early enough to secure a decent spot, the za was definitely worth the 40 minute wait.   With that in mind, I was pretty intrigued by the prospect of a Grimaldi's pizza without the 2 hour line at the original location. I think, however, that there are forces at work to keep me and a Grimaldi's pizza apart and they have followed me to Phoenix.  This place is f*cking hard to find without a GPS. It's hidden in a shopping plaza across from a movie theater with some of the most understated signage ever.  The service was pleasant enough, and attentive. The antipasti and drinks came to the table right away and I hoped within 15-20 mins our pizza would follow.  20 mins pass. 25. Then 30, then 35. Where the hell is the 'za? People who were seated after I was are being served tasty looking pizzas and I got nothin'.   I noticed that Honey Boo-Boo's family, who were seated a couple tables away from me about ten minutes after I arrived were enjoying a pie that was identical to what I ordered. Shortly after they begin devouring that first pizza, they are presented with another pizza, which is followed by some discussion with their server and what seems to be some sort of apology. As if they had been given the wrong pizza and had begun eating it anyhow.   Yeah, they were eating my pizza. The server had goofed something up, and within 2 minutes brought a pizza to my table that was not at all what I had ordered as if she had a clue.   I asked for my check. The server told me the manager was coming to my table but no one ever showed.  She boxed the pizza up for me (it was mushroom, onion and tomato, not pepperoni as I had ordered, and I'm sorry, but I think putting tomato slices on a pizza that already has tomato sauce is dumb and I am not down to become a vegetarian because you botched my order) and I never did receive a check for it but I did tip her what would have been 20% of the bill.  Poor handling of my case leads me to believe they're all new and learning how to work together, but I can't see coming back to this particular location. Maybe I'll try Scottsdale instead or go to Barro's.  BTW- when it comes to pizza in Brooklyn, it's Carmine's or Lucali hands down over Grimaldi's anyhow.

Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful.   No matter whether I'm at Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.  A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really "date night" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks.   You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.  The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?  Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin.

Listen...you can tell yourself a lot of lies in this life.   "I don't like to eat pork"  "Fried food is yucky"  "I like unsweet tea"  "I'd never eat alligator"  Lies, lies, lies!  Pork is delicious- adding it to any dish makes it ten times tastier. That's why Flavors' dirty rice, red beans and rice, the gumbo and the jambalaya all have some sort of tasty pork in them!   Fried food is best enjoyed when someone else is frying it, and the onion rings will serve you right, son. A crawfish pie (sadly, only seems to be available as part of the Cajun Trio) will make you ponder what you're even doing with your life and why aren't you eating more of these scrumptious crawfish-laden flaky-ass things? You can add an extra pie to the Trio when you order, and I suggest you do. Because damn.  You can't really be sitting there, drinking an unsweet tea with your Louisiana meal, can you? Get a sweet tea, fool! Stop tryna be healthy! This ain't the spot for that.   How can a reptile whose evolution peaked in the time of the dinosaurs become so crispy good when battered and doused in hot oil? Dip it in some remoulade and don't question Jeebus, because he knows what he's doing.  Flavors has outstanding food and great service. The Joliet Rouge might be my favorite dinner ever. Blackened catfish, with crawfish and skrimps on top in a tomato creole style sauce over dirty rice with garlic bread- holy good lord.   WORTH THE DRIVE FROM ANY PART OF THE WORLD!!! I love Flavors.

The meat burek is awesome and the most filling $5 lunch you can buy. Bosnian cuisine is awesome, as well, but the menu here is limited to mostly bakery items.  Take home some of the breads and you'll be pleased. They make amazing sandwiches and go quite well with some good olive oil, too.  Do not be put off by the patrons speaking another language besides English. I have struck up a few friendly conversations with Bosniaks in English to pass the time waiting for my food to be ready and learned a thing or two about politics in the former Yugoslavia along the way.

It was called the "Puttanesca". Translate that from Italian into English and you'll come up with "whore's style". She may be a whore, but this whore has got good taste.  Rock shrimp, calamari, capers, olives, fennel, spicy tomato sauce on a really good thin crust doesn't sound much like a working girl's version of a pizza to me, but I will be hard pressed to order something else when I come back.   I would be kicked out of the club if they hear that I approved of cheese with seafood, so don't tell anyone.

No slices on the weekends, which was a bummer because I was by myself and didn't need a whole pie.  My buffalo steak sandwich, while a great concept (buffalo sauce on a cheesesteak) was salty and not what I expected. I think it might have even been gyro meat aka lamb on there and not beef. Anyhow, it was too salty and I drank a gallon of water an hour later and still feel thirsty. As you're reading this years later, I'm still thirsty.  I applaud a local business and it's a fun looking place, but I hope the 'za is much better than the sandwiches.   Someone did ask me how my meal was while I was there, so maybe this means they're tweaking the menu?  I'll come back again and see if things taste better.

FnB is an experience that is best enjoyed when you leave your comfort zone at the door before entering.   There's no praise that I can heap on top of the praises that have already been given by others- you will have a memorable meal here for all of the right reasons.

Half price Happy Hour- no wonder it's always packed in the bar area- attracting all the lovely milfs from Norterra and they huzzbins.   As the name suggests, anything with mushrooms will make you mellow and be delicious, too. I am not the biggest fan of the pretzels. They're just not what I expect when pretzels come to mind- don't taste at all like the pretzels you get at a WaWa which is pretty much my baseline for pretzels. The hummus was excellent and so are the wings. The beer selection is really good and if you've never had Maui Coconut Porter in a can, don't sleep on it!  If I lived closer, I'd make myself a regular.

All I know is that they make the best al pastor burritos and tacos in Phoenix. They are just sweet enough, just savory enough and I always want 50 more of them.   When it's sunny and not smoldering hot outside, the picnic tables out front are a great place to have lunch. Parking can get to be tricky when it's busy but you can go next door and thrift shop it up while you wait for your food to be ready.

This is a Destination XL store now- which is still affiliated with Casual Male, but it's definitely more upscale and from the modest storefront you'd never guess how nice this store is once you enter through the glass doors.   It's tough to find 2XLT sizes at your typical stores, even those with a Big & Tall section. Here, I find everything in my size and it's made by Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Nautica instead of Toughskins or Carrhart.   They also carry shoes in extra large sizes so I can finally get the 14EEEs off the rack and that NEVER happens. Belts, sunglasses, ties, socks, boxers, tshirts, suit separates and workout clothing- you could get your entire wardrobe taken care of.  It's not the cheapest price-wise, however it's worth it for the great customer service I got from Les and not having to hunt for my sizes amongst the mortal sized gear.

Not fair. A co-worker turned me on to the carne asada burrito and I can't bring myself to order anything else here.   Beef. Guacamole. Pico de Gallo. Wrapped in a flour tortilla. With green & red hot sauce on the side. Get the fock outta here.

It was a slow Sunday evening and it was rainy out so my main squeeze and I had the bar to ourselves. Owing to the lack of clientele we were able to try just about any beer we wanted before settling into a pint.   The bartender at QV pub introduced me to Innis & Gunn Cask Ale. It's aged in barrels that were once used to age rum. Do you understand how good that makes a beer taste?   Next time I am on the north end of the Strip, I'm stopping in for a pint of that ale!

It's not the most organized space inside the store but don't let that upset you- the service I got here was outstanding.   I did not grow up with a pool in my backyard but for the past two summers I've lived with a 10 foot deep diving pool that gives me fits. It gets yellow algae growth the moment I turn my back on it for 24 hours, the chlorine levels and pH are never steady and I should probably hire a pool service company but I like a challenge.   Storms with wind and rain and me working overtime a few days in a row = a very green pool and I knew I had to do something to make it pay for its insolence.   The other pool supply stores seem more about selling you their products than really solving your issues but that wasn't how I felt at Northwest. I explained the deal with my green pool and I was prescribed Coppercide and 8 gallons of liquid chlorine.   HASA Coppercide is only $20 a bottle which beats buying two cans of Yellow Gone at WalMart for $25 (which never kills ALL of the algae anyhow), and that bottle + the chlorine annihilated the algae in my pool.   Instead of $5 bags of shock, I'm going with the liquid chlorine from now on. Much cheaper and more effective and advised by the person who stood to profit the most from "selling" me something more than I needed- the owner's wife.  The HASA products seem to work better in general and I haven't really seen them on the shelves at other local stores.

Been here once, but once is enough to know that I'm going to become a regular.  It's a really cool-looking spot, with all kinds of memorabilia from its former life as an actual garage. You have to check out the bathrooms for instance.  Great bar area, with plenty of room to spread out, and they have outdoor seating out front right next to it.  I made this an expensive evening because we a) ordered an appetizer followed by both special entrees and b) drank like there was no tomorrow. It was worth the cost, and I sometimes have buyer's remorse from my Friday evenings out.   San Tan and Stella on tap, grilled lamb chops followed by more beers and a big ass ribeye sitting on grilled asparagus and ginormous shrimp on lemon polenta with corn and even more San Tan and Stella equaled about a c-note. Like the movie producer said about a piece of ass in Godfather part I, this was one of the best steaks I've ever had, and I've had em all over the world! I hope they make those specials permanent menu items.  The service was also excellent, and we had a conversation with our server about the food and the beers they served which was really helpful in deciding what to order.

Can't sing enough praise for The Garage.  Happy Hour with the half priced appetizers is the best. You can get 4 big-ass grilled lamb chops for $7, and they will honor your Groupon as well.  Speaking of Groupon, they usually run "NOW" deals that you could redeem for lunch any weekday.  Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.

Showing some signs of age, but still a great spot for lunch or happy hour- with delicious food of above-average quality and presentation, and well-poured drinks.  So, sometimes the menus are sticky from not being wiped down thoroughly, but the cute and kind female servers make me quickly forget about that minute detail.   If you order a salad, ask for the house vinaigrette dressing. If you go for lunch and order the Chicken & Chips, have someone to share that plate with because it's enough for two people.

You don't need to pay retail for that blender! Or that deep fryer/pressure cooker/coffee maker.  I moved to PHX a couple years ago with 4 pieces of luggage on a 737 so I needed to completely stock my entire life. I managed to get a lot of my kitchen stocked at Kitchen Switchin'.  The shelves and cabinets are full of a varied array of utensils, gadgets, plates, vessels and cookbooks. They don't stock the Wal-Mart stuff here. It's usually Cuisinart or Bodum or KitchenAid. The store is always clean, there are not even traces of prior use on 99% of their items, and the staff are really helpful when you need to find something.  Some of the knives that you'll find here are seriously high grade Japanese folded steel and Cutco brand for more than 50% off new retail prices.    The only catch? It's a resale shop, so you'll have to take what they have on hand at the time. However, if you're patient the other two knives/plates in the set might be in stock next month for the same deep discount you got the others for.  Worth a stop any time I am driving down 7th. Street.

The only gripe I have here is that my 3D glasses were kinda scummy, and no matter how many times I dipped my straw into my glass, and cleaned them with my napkin, I just could not get them cleaned off completely.  Imagine sitting in a huge, comfy chair with a glass (as in, used to be sand) of ice cold liquid, a gourmet flat bread pizza brought to you by a server, all you can munch popcorn and a little button you push to recline your chair, while you watch a first-run movie. This is the experience at iPic Scottsdale.  It was Thor 3D. The sound was amazing and the picture, though a little fuzzy because of my scuzzy glasses, was awesome.    For me, it was the whole experience, not focusing on how good or bad the food was, or how good or bad the service was, but I rate iPic on these criteria:  My ass. In a recliner. With a cold one. Brought to me by a waiter. And a pizza. Brought to me by a waiter. Watching a brand new movie. In Scottsdale.   If my 3D glasses were clean, instant 5 star. 4.5 as it was.

Good lord, the macaroni salad makes you want to give up and quit your job so you can pull up a chair to the kitchen window and eat it all day. The short ribs are my favorite meal- they are seasoned that perfect balance of sweet & savory- and all the platters are big enough for a huge dinner or two lunches...if you eat like most mainlanders eat. If you're a Samoan, eh, not so much...you better order two meals!  The staff is always friendly and smiling and the dining room is very clean. The menu has catering prices on the back page, and you could get a backyard luau going for 50 people for about $200.  I'll totally host the luau as long as it's BYOB and I can keep the leftovers.

I've been to Leo's for lunch and dinner well over a dozen times and they serve consistently great tasting food and the staff always provides service with a smile.  I waver as to what my favorite plate lunch is, but recently I've been doing the seafood mix- which is shrimp, fish filets and their hawaiian-style bbq chicken served with steamed sticky rice, steamed vegetables and the best macaroni salad in the world. You can opt for brown rice for .50 cents. If you haven't tried their short ribs, you better order those because they're outstanding, but so is the Kalua Pork, Loco Moco and the curry.  If you like Chinese-style steamed pork buns (and if you have taste buds, you should love them), they call them Manapua here and they're really good.   The dining room is small- only room for about 30 people if it's fully packed in wall-to-wall, but there are a couple of outdoor tables for days when the sun isn't scorching. Calling ahead for carry-out is fine for those days when you want to binge watch Game Of Thrones in your boxer shorts, but don't forget to take some katsu sauce, teriyaki and soy sauce with you when you pick up your grub.   I would recommend Leo's to anyone, and if they don't like their food, I'd delete their contact info immediately and unfriend them on facebook.

Me: Si...si...una lengua, un camaron, y un al pastor por favor. Y una Coca Cola de Mexico! Andale!   Tall dude with mad tats: Siete treinta y ocho, por favor.  Me: Chingada! Es barato! Esos tacos son para enanos?  Tall dude with mad tats: No! Nuestros tacos son por el gente regular!  Me: (take a bite from the delicious tacos before me and remove 6 shooter from holster and fire into the ceiling repeatedly) Ahhhhh-ha!   So, I didn't really ask the guy if those were dwarf-sized tacos, but upon hearing the cost ($7.38) compared to what I ordered, I thought I was paying for tiny tacos. For the tasty deliciousness that was my tongue, al pastor and shrimp taco with a Mexican Coke lunch, it was a bargain and they were regular sized tacos, not appetizer sized.  Dude said he always wanted a skylight so he let me slide on the bullet holes in the ceiling.

If you are in the mood for a delicious meal made from quality ingredients and friendly, sharp service, then make yourself a reservation at Litchfield's.  Groupon makes me try new restaurants and an expiring Groupon brought me here last Saturday night for dinner. I was not alone in my procrastination, as they were packed early in the evening, leaving me with an 8pm dinner reservation for two.  The booth we were seated in was comfortable and the atmosphere was warm, inviting and not formal at all, which I was thankful for. I was thankful for this because I was wearing shorts and flip flops as were some of the other diners. It's a golf resort establishment, so wear something with a collar but no need for a jacket or tie, y'all.  We didn't do the Restaurant Week menu- it was not an option to be paired with Groupon- so we ordered the charcuterie plate and I opted for the Cedar River AZ ribeye and my main squeeze ordered the pan roasted halibut. *FYI- the menu on Yelp is old and dusty and not at all close to what they're serving now so find that here:http://wigwamarizona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Litchfields-Menu-Summer-2015F.pdf  Servers brought warm sourdough on the half-loaf with house made herb butter. Delicious and not too overwhelming portion wise. You ask for more, and they'll bring you some.   The kitchen is open to the dining room and I mean it's one of the more transparent food prep and fire areas you'll see at a restaurant. There's a wood-fired grill and oven with a gas range next to it, each one helmed by its own chef in clear view of the dining room should you choose to see how they work the food orders for the waitstaff.  For $15, the charcuterie plate was crazy good and the portions were enough for 4 people. Duck prosciutto, hot coppa ham, dried chorizo, some fresh white cheeses (cheese should never be yellow or American), corn nuts made in the kitchen, some bomb ass olives, pickles and small slices of grilled bread. Damn good, people.  Plates were timed perfectly as our entrees arrived less than 5 minutes after we finished destroying the appetizer.   The presentations are not crazy artistic with lots of sauces drizzled and things on plates, but my steak and her fish filet looked outstanding. The ribeye was served with garlic mashed yukon golds and a nice, smoky red wine sauce while the halibut was laid atop some wild mushrooms of several varieties, baby spinach and snap peas.   Both the steak and the fish were cooked to perfection- with the halibut having that golden crust that makes for terrific flavor and a medium rare ribeye from the wood fire over cast iron grates. Both entrees were delicious and the portions were large but not overwhelming.   I ain't new to eating good food so believe me when I say that we had great service and a dynamite meal at Litchfield's. I don't know what the deal is with the other reviews dissing the place. I will definitely be back for dinner.  If you have the time, check out the extensive collection of historic photos from the early days of the resort and Goodyear/ Litchfield Park. The resort has stunning grounds and the furniture is boss.

So, this is owned by the guy who owns Stumpy's down the block, and I want it to succeed, because I think he's a good dude who always greets customers and seems genuinely concerned about all of us.  I dropped in for Happy Hour one Friday evening (which ends at 6pm, btw) and the crowd was mostly people in their mid 40's-50's out for Friday night to kick off the weekend. The bartenders were friendly and they were busy. I had some cold draft beers and the salmon flatbread, which I thought was great. Anything with capers and horseradish on a pizza crust (and it's the same crust as at Stumpy's which I do enjoy) I'm all in and not only did it taste great, it looked appetizing. Everyone else at the bar was eyeing my grub but I told them to get their own.  Thirteen North is walking distance from my place, so I'll likely be a regular, even though the crowd is 10-15 years older than I am. I love to support a local business that cares about its customers.

Go. Ask for a table on the patio when the weather's nice.  No choice but to valet park so bring some folding money with you and don't be put off by all the suits if you come for lunch. The vibe is upper crust but it's casual.  Try the Russian Roulettes, but don't order the Fatoosh salad with the salmon which is smoked on premises unless you never want to eat any other salad again. It's that damn good.  Windsor is also the home of one of the best Arnold Palmers that you'll enjoy at a restaurant in Phoenix.

The line begins to form before 7am. The doors open at 8. Is this a Motley Crue concert or the DMV?   Imagine the slowest most agonizing death possible. Add to that scene giggling teenagers and zombie-like civil servants and the waiting for your number to be called as if you're at the deli at Fry's. All that's between you and waiting another 2 hours is a tiny slip of paper with a letter followed by three numbers.  "our computer is down, we can't print out your license so you'll have to visit another location"   -next location @ 26th Ave & the 101-  "our computer is down, we can't..."  Pfffft!

When I'm at work and I want a burger for lunch, the Habit is in my heavy rotation because it's 5 minutes away and it's really good. Less than $7 for lunch that's freshly made and delicious in this part of N. Central PHX is a win and you won't need to tip anyone or wait long to eat.  Is there a friendlier staff? Hard to find one. The dining room, the soda and drinks and the condiment area are always clean. Sometimes the tables could use more frequent cleanup and I've been here twice where someone has dropped a heinous deuce in the bathroom that the ventilation couldn't handle. It emanated into the dining room so I moved outside.   I think the burgers are some of the tastiest around and the fries are pretty damn good, too. I need to venture off of just burgers because the menu definitely offers more, but I love the char-burger so I can't quit it just yet.  Yeah, if management reads this...do something about the crapper, definitely. Bigger & badder exhaust fan or something.

So, they could use some work on the way the place looks and the way it works. There was not much business on the Saturday night that I was here and it really seemed as if I walked in on a "soft opening".  First, when you walk past, you have no effing idea where the effing front door is. Is it on the west or the north side of the building? Why isn't there a sign? So that you don't walk around aimlessly as I did- it's on the north side of the building, facing the parking lot. There's also no host/hostess so you walk in and say "hello?" hoping someone answers.   The parking lot right in front of the open windows of the dining room= every time someone pulls in at night with their lights on, it gets real bright and/or blinds you depending on where you're seated.  The decor? Damn. It looks like a mismatched set of rustic Alaska, Colorado and Tuscany. There weren't any barrels and wagon wheels in Italy the last time I was in Italy. There was also an undecorated fake Christmas tree in the center of the dining room.  The menu is all over as well. A few Italian classics alongside some Shrimp N Grits, Meatloaf and Fried Chicken. My head is spinning. Am I at Mr. Cacciatore's or am I at Marie Callender's?  The best thing that we tried were the Arancini or the rice balls. Blackened Tilapia was under-seasoned, carbonara was OK, beer selection was decent and well poured.   Service was not bad but I don't think I would come back unless they focus the menu and figure out who they are.

If you're out here in the far, FAR west side and the smell of wood smoke turning meats into tasty morsels for your enjoyment makes you smile, then you can't pass up Dillon's. You get good value at any Dillon's but this one especially.  It's a little over-priced but the portions are very large and where else in metro PHX are you gonna dine in front of a HUGE aquarium full of sharks and stingrays? Also, there were tablets on each table to keep everyone occupied if the views of the sea creatures weren't enough.  My server- Carly- was excellent. She handled everything with a gorgeous smile and with ease and I'd go back just to sit in her section again. She was wrangling  the other tables' kids dropping crayons and refilling drinks like it was no big deal.   After a hot day walking around the zoo, it's nice to be able to sit down at Dillon's, get a cold one and some smoked KC style barbecue so don't miss it.

If you have been to some of the Asian buffets in AZ, and you've liked them, I'd say you must try Jasmine Tokyo.   I'm 6'4" and I get "Do you play for the Cardinals?" a lot, so I'm sure that when the proprietors see me darken the door of their establishment they're all like "ohsh*t." Fear not, lil Asian lady, for I am not a glutton. I'm here for the seafood and the sushi and some green tea.  As far as the sushi selection goes, it beats anything AYCE in the Valley that I've seen. There were at least 20 types of rolls and it wasn't just surimi crab and tempura, either. The tuna and salmon and snapper nigiri were really good, too.  If you have room for some fried rice, this one is delicious and so are the Chinese sausages and grilled chicken. Even the raw oysters were good, and that has never happened to me in AZ before.  Service was pleasant, and from the way it's decorated, I'm guessing this was once a Claim Jumper. Anyhow, it's a huge restaurant with a huge selection of items and if you're a vegetarian, you will be in heaven here with more vegetarian offerings than I've ever seen at a buffet.   Seaweed is a vegetable, isn't it?

Seen here twice and I used the WAHOO service each time to cut down on wait time. It worked very well and I was very satisfied with the speed of getting to see a physician.  If you need x-rays, blood tests, etc, it's all done here so you don't need to take doctor's orders and drive somewhere else to have that taken care of.   I was pleased with the level of care and treatment I got at NextCare and I will be back if the need arises.

If you walk in and ask for "due palle" you'd get two scoops of whatever flavor you point at. The very nice couple behind the counter are Italian and they make gelato the same way it's made in Roma.   Stray away from vanilla & chocolate and go for something more authentic, like amaretti or pistachio or stracciatella. The fruit flavors will make you happy if that's what you're into. If you have caught yourself riding the Nutella wave that's washing over America right now, get a scoop of bacio.   No, leaving your carton of ice cream out to thaw for 20 mins at home does not make it gelato. One taste of the gelato here will make you understand why.

Imagine the grocery portion of Costco, without the membership fee and the Brady Bunch portion sizes, and that's WinCo.   The bulk food bins- raw almonds for $2.99 a pound is a great deal. 3 pork roasts for $10...that's pulled pork one night, souvlaki another night, and Hunan pork another, all without needing an extra refrigerator/freezer in your garage. The roast beef that's $3.99 a pound tastes like bologna, but they also offer the real deal for a few dollars more. Produce and dry goods are good quality and priced at a discount.  You won't keep as much of your take home pay on items like toilet paper, household cleaners or pet food as compared to WalMart or other supermarkets, but you will see the extra $$ on their grocery items.   It's not pretty, and there's no olive bar, but you will save major coin if you don't mind bagging your own groceries and not using a credit card. They have booze, too. Yay!

When you can parallel park in front of Salty's on a Friday night you know it's meant to be.   Look, for $6 you can stuff your face with one of the best damned sausages in the world. With or without the tasty bun. Your sausage comes with your choice of condiment (I chose the pickle relish for my beer brat and the sauerkraut for the lamb sausage) and if you have another $6 you can get a pint of Hefeweizen to accompany the sausage. Maybe dig around in your money belt and locate another $6 and order a Chimay instead of a Hefe? It'll come in an authentic Chimay glass, as will the other super legit crafty beers on the menu.  Try out the home made pretzel, but you don't need to dip it in fundido because the mustard is quite good and some fusion just doesn't quite work. Seriously...I know it's AZ and all, but that's a miss of a combination.  The staff is attentive and they know the menu well enough to riff with you on pairing beers with what you order from the food column. Our server said something about a Nutella-chocolate-malted shake at the end of the meal so we had to add that experience to the meal and it didn't disappoint at all. So good, in fact, that Nutella will be added to all home made milkshakes in my blender from now on.  I would come back again and again and again to Brat Haus.

I'm serving notice upon you all- I call this bar from 11a-1pm every Saturday, so find somewhere else to drink.  They aren't overpriced (Stella was $4, craft brews were $5), and they are very good at understanding that you're here to drink beer, so unless your glass is empty you can enjoy conversation with your friends and not the staff.

Gotta downgrade my rating slightly. The prices have risen on their seafood, meat and produce and the store has become even more disorganized. They don't stock Ting! anymore, either. I find myself down at Lee Lee more than LF nowadays, even though LF is 5 mins from my house.

Please follow along with this review in your best "late night urban radio DJ/love talk & slow jams host voice" with imagined Barry White and Teddy Pendergrass songs playing in the background...  The pizzas at Humble Pie are described so attractively on the menu and they're each just enough for two people to share, but maybe a little too much for one person. Especially if you happen to be a ladyyyyyy. Ladies looooove to eat pizza, they just won't eat too much of it in front of most men they're not married to.  Imagine you're with a lovely ladylove of yours, and gently popping roasted olives into her mouth...one by one...hot.   Damn, she doesn't like olives? How about some tempura-fried green beans that you can tease her lips with, slowly at first, then with increasing intensity until they're all gone?   Yeahhhh...that's a nice appetizer for your special lady.  The small and dimly lit dining room sets the mood for romance. Your eyes locked onto hers, as you each sip a tall domestic beer, anxiously awaiting the arrival of your main course. The cardboard pizza boxes all around enhance the sexy ambiance.  If your woman is adventurous, she might go for the fig and prosciutto pizza. With goat cheese, it's soooo creamy good. Traditional ladies would probably let you get away with pulling a Margherita on them, because tomato, basil and mozzarella never hurt nobody. You might even have yourself a real freak on your hands who wants that Meat Lovers joint allll night long.  Nevermind the screaming toddlers and the sports on the TVs near the dining room. These dim lights and pizza can only mean one thing. Awwww yeah...it's time to get on down. Mmmm hmmmm.  Ain't gonna be no leftovers tonight. Nuh uh. Y'all are hungry for it and you are gonna finish what you started.  You got some Beano, Tums and Mylanta in your glovebox for later, playa?    There's no such thing as a bad pizza, but this one was just OK. Don't forget that Thursday night is date night...at Humble Pie...

This is not a train- it's a roller coaster! Seriously- is this thing safe? I don't see how we didn't fly off the rails last night it was going so damn fast, but I appreciated the speed cause I was tired and ready to go the hell home after my 5 hour flight from the east coast. It's like the Disney Monorail but it feels like it carries a higher personal injury factor.  With the rise in popularity of GPS based ride-share apps like Uber & Lyft, and the traditional cab companies trying hard to prevent pick ups and drop offs at the terminals, the Sky Train is the place to be picked up.   Signage in & out of the Sky Train station could be more obvious and perhaps even lighted at night, and for a weekday evening when the airport terminals and baggage claim were packed, there was no one on the Sky Train taking it out to the Light Rail station. So it has that not busy or crowded thing going for it.

I'm that guy who likes both white table linen restaurants, and Asian buffets.  My usual spot is closed so I use the Yelp app to see what else is within 10 miles and I am pointed to Oriental Buffet.   It's hard to find even with GPS. The vast expanse of far North Peoria at night is a ghost town with little pockets of colorfully-lighted civilization along Lake Pleasant Pkwy.   Here, next to a Wal-Mart, illuminated by the same fluorescent lighting you'd find in a government office building, is a very decent Asian dining find.  Their sushi selection is not the most expansive, but it's serviceable. It's the cooked seafood on the steam tables that is really, really good.   The ginger fried shrimp and the crab (not the Snow Crab legs, which cost extra $$) are awesome. You should eat the head-on shrimp with the shell after removing the legs. The head is edible, but kinda pokey for the mouth, so chew gently. Crunchy and damn good. The cut up clusters of lump crabmeat and legs are also completely edible, shell and all, however, you'll find the claws and the joints tougher to masticate so no one would blame you for picking out the meat and discarding those parts.    Steamed clams, and mussels and shrimp prepared in other ways are also available, and so are a few different preparations of fish, but it's the crabs and shrimp that really stand out and what I'll come back for.

If there's something not to like about The Yard, I don't know what it is.  Oh, yeah. My bad. I do know what it is. It's the parking sitch.  Painful waits to park or exit when it's busy, and there's now a sign which alerts you that you will be towed if you park on a neighborhood street.   Other than that parking deal, it's a great spot to chill. Hard to imagine a better looking patio with more comfortable options to place your rump and daydrink. The service doesn't hover but they're around when you need a refill or to re-up. Prices are not horrible and you can order great snacks from Culinary Dropout across the floor. The bathroom is begging you to walk in on someone of the opposite sex, but use it as a conversation starter if there's a lull in the action.  It has been said that the staff here range from dirty-hot to nerdy-hot. They do, which makes them hot either way. I will look at an attractive woman like a hungry lion unless someone smacks me and tells me to stop and the lady friend in my group did the same to the menfolk working here. What a perv, man.  The crowd was pretty mixed every time I've dropped in. A few older folks, some teenagers, hot moms with strollers and a couple douchebags thrown in. I prefer a bowl of m&ms to a bowl of just rice or beans though, don't you?

I'm not Vietnamese. Hell, I'm not even Asian. I dated a couple Asian girls once. Had to break up with Suki when I bought the Porsche because she got tired of sitting on Kimmy's lap. It was a two-seater.  What I'm saying is that I know what good Vietnamese food tastes like and they serve it here.   20% off appetizers before 7 pm makes it feel like you're stealing from these folks but they are cool with it.

Happy hour from one till 6 PM on the weekends. That means a special happy hour menu for food and for drinks. The bar is spacious and very comfortable - the stools are the type you could sit on for quite a few hours without your butt falling asleep. Jen was the bartender on this particular Saturday. Yes, she's extremely cute and I have a gigantic crush on her, but she also has a great personality, she knows the drinks that she pours and she will answer all your questions about their menu.   Try the prime rib sliders, they were excellent. The fried chips & the fried pickles also excellent, however not the healthiest thing in the world. Both are big enough to share with a couple other people.  The Rodeo Cold and Deep Canyon amber beers are only $3 at happy hour and 2 of my faves.  I'm going to call Saturdays from 1 to 6 at this bar, so you'll have to pick another time to come here.

Staff attitude makes a helluva difference to me when I'm considering where to frequent and that's why I've dined at Culinary Dropout a sh*tload.  I haven't been to the other locations in Scottsdale or Vegas so I'm only speaking for the 7th. Street venue. Everyone engages with you and they all seem to be really into the kind of food & beverages that they're serving. You already know you won't get a conversation about whether they have lox or nova salmon at a chain restaurant, but you can talk that sh*t here with servers who can riff on it with you.  Pretzel bites with fondue are a mainstay. So is a sampling of their cold cuts and some crusty bread with olive oil. They pour sweet balsamic vinegar into the oil so dip it deep, y'all, and hit that spot.  Seared Tuna Salad is my favorite for lunch, followed by the French Dip sammich. I've tried the fried chicken and it wasn't the move for me. First of all, it's got a sweet tasting crust and some Indian or Mexican spices rubbed into it which together make me believe that they batter the chicken in Frosted Flakes and Coriander with a lil chili powder. I'm all for trying stuff, but I think as a Southerner that I am a fried chicken purist who expects savory, not sweet.  Ask for a booth if they have one open. Tell the girl in the red top sitting by the stage who accidentally smacked me as I walked by to call me because she was fine as hell and I would sop her up with a Culinary Dropout biscuit.

I am from the home of the original Five Guys burger joint in the Washington, DC area. Now they're all over the USA and I have never been to a Five Guys anywhere that was not the same burger and fries as I had the first time I ate one when I was in Junior High. It's always consistent and I think it's the best burger you can get for under $6 anywhere.  I love In N Out. I love Five Guys just a tiny bit more.   2 different experiences (no peanuts to enjoy while you wait at In N Out and not as clean at Five Guys) and Five Guys costs more, but one order of fries and a burger might convert you if you already have a favorite burger joint.

I love Sprouts for food. It's not a "supermarket" where you can get everything that you need for the house- Sprouts is about food and nutrition and fresh.  Their sausages are made in-house and they're usually about $3 a pound for sweet or hot italian, brats, or chorizo. Their deli and bulk foods are typically a good value for the money and this particular Sprouts has the best looking seafood department in the area.  It's hard to beat Sprouts' prices on produce and it's all gorgeous.   I'm grateful that the old smelly Basha's is gone from this location and this shiny and clean Sprouts has taken its place. The parking lot is PACKED after work on weeknights, so be warned.

Best sushi on the Westside. They are almost hole-in-the-wall in size and decor but they serve up some delicious rolls and they price everything ridiculously low. Other places would only put California rolls on their HH menu but the $4 spicy tuna roll is like something you'd pay double for elsewhere. I probably sound like a cheap ass right about now but I wasn't always able to make it rain big face hunnreds on chicks like I do erryday, so I stay value-conscious. Try the spicy scallop roll and maybe some Soju if you aren't driving. The lady who runs the place always gives me a bottle of sake to go. I hope they stay in business for a long, long time. I love this place.

So good, and so very unlike anything else in the area.   You won't believe what Bootleggers looks like inside when you pull into the parking lot of the typical Phoenix strip mall it inhabits just east of the 51. The atmosphere is unisexually appealing and so is the menu of food and drink.  If you are with the guys and you want large portions of meats, go for the ribs or a steak. Get one of the rotating local craft brews to go along with it. If you are out with your girls, get small plates or the bacon board to share and drink some apple pie moonshine or a glass of wine.  You will be seduced by the smoky smells coming from the smoker- which is behind glass near the bar so you can check it out.  If you sit at the bar, say hi to Robin and if you want a sip of something to drink before committing, just ask her.

I love their burgers. They're cooked to order and served up piping hot. Their fries are always crisp. For me, nothing beats ketchup with a few splashes of hot sauce & Habit always has Cholula & Tabasco near their condiment station.   There's obviously an emphasis on service with a smile at every Habit I've visited and any dining experience is better when you feel genuinely welcome and you feel the staff are doing their best to earn your repeat business.  Not nearly as busy as the 7th & Glendale location and perhaps this location is not very well known or overshadowed by several competitors close by.

The system for ordering- you line up and go through cafeteria-style- is kinda weird, BUT you can circumvent that by sitting at the bar.   We tried the classic burger and the "Llano Poblano" with the regular fries. The burgers are juicy and cooked right with good beef flavor. I was glad to see they are not asking $10+ for all of their burgers, just one of them.  The fries are pretty good and there's enough for two unless you're in a gluttonous mood.  The highlight of the meal was their $5 milkshake- the caramel sea salt. I'm asked weekly to go back for one.

In need of something with very sexy fuel economy because there are two gas guzzlers in my garage, I make the rounds at the used car departments at large dealerships in Tempe, Scottsdale, Phoenix and Peoria.  I've got a cash deal to offer for something cheap and economical and I want to be around $13k out the door.   Bait and switch at one dealership. Astronomical retail prices at another. Nothing in the inventory w/ under 100k miles in my price range at another place. Trying too hard to convince me to finance when I have cash and lying about attempting to run a credit app at the last dealership I visited. Private party deals prove to be flakes, want to trade vehicles or total BS.  After two weeks of searching, I was discouraged. Then I researched Hertz Car Sales program. I did A LOT of reading, looked over a ton of information and customer feedback and decided that it's the best option for my particular needs.  They price their vehicles for a no-haggle deal. They offer coupons for $300- $1000 off the purchase price online. You get enough Hertz Gold points for a week's rental if you buy here, too.   Scott was great from the start of our email communication to when I drove off of the lot with my new (new to me) and very miserly 34 mpg average car.   He still owes me some floor mats and a small interior trim piece that were missing from the car at the time of sale, so I will be following up this review with that outcome, but I was shocked at the great selection of cars and how easy this transaction was.  Hertz should work well for you if A) you want a no-frills second or third/fourth car B) you don't mind a car with (relatively) higher mileage C) you hate the nebulous pricing and car salesman/woman games D) you have your own cash/financing.

Update: got the interior trim piece and the floor mats from Scott as he promised a few weeks back. Very satisfied with the service from Hertz Car Sales and now looking into booking a vacation to use the free week in a rental from Hertz.

I almost don't want you to know about Whining Pig, because I don't want it to blow up too fast. Reminds me of the bars in Brooklyn- this is a tiny bar that maximizes the space it inhabits in this strip mall on what has become a really hot corner in Uptown PHX. Parking is a betch. Some nights it's SRO, but when you can get settled in you're forced to meet new people because of the close quarters that you share. That's a good thing. Can you beat $3 beers/$5 wines for happy hour? This ain't rail stuff he's serving either- the selection changes often which encourages you to get out of your comfort zone and try something new. If you are hungry- the cheese plate comes with plenty for two people to share and they serve desserts, too.

Still great and such a chill little place, but I still don't want you to know about it.   It has nothing to do with there being a clique of regulars here that you will be excluded from, or with there being a secret handshake- no. It's such a small space with so little room that barstools are at a premium and very coveted.  There aren't any taps but this is the best place in the valley to try a new (or new to you) beer.

I love this place. Been here quite a few times now.  I love this place because it stands out among the hordes of Mexican food places serving smothered in cheese and sauce Mexican food. That's not my Mexican food at all. La Santisima is.   The location is across 59th. Ave from Old Town Glendale so not exactly walkable from Old Town because who wants to cross Grand and risk death by car. There's a small parking lot in the back of the restaurant though.   It's never very busy when I've been for a weekend lunch or dinner. La Perla next door can be packed with patrons and 20 tables will be empty at La Santisima some weekends. That simply means less hassle to get some of the best food you can find in Glendale.  I would recommend trying anything with arrachera in the description and the al pastor tacos. Their seafood choices are bangin' too.   Their salsa bar will challenge your ideas of what a salsa can be made of.   If you want to go for lunch or dinner at La Santisima and you can't find a date, I'll go with you anytime.

Dubina is 5 star, IMHO.  When they first opened, I was skeptical. A local brewery? In N. Glendale/Arrowhead? Not a chain? Crowdfunded?  A few months later and I can see they are growing the business and the operation in a smart way. I sure as hell hope they stay around for a very long time.   The interior of the space was all stark white walls and fluorescent lighting when they opened. I would have described it as "clean" but that'd be about it. The low, drop ceiling, chairs, tables, booths, barstools and concrete floors are still here but the lighting has been warmed up and there's a coat of paint on the walls now. It seems more welcoming and homier but you should focus on the beer when you visit.  I'm not a beer snob. Warm beer is about the only brew that I'll ever hate on. That being stated, I've gotten a beer education since I've begun to frequent Dubina. I know that a Gose is a sour, German style beer and that a sweet Barley Wine is the highest ABV beer and one of these will give you a nice beer buzz. I know that a nitro tap imparts those microscopic bubbles that give the Dubina Milk Stout its smooth and easy to drink features.   The staff always gives me a taste of the beers I'm unsure about and so far my faves are the Dubina Ale and the Milk Stout on nitro. Most of the brews are $5.   The food menu has also evolved from a brat and a pulled pork sammich to wings and amazing fresh-baked pretzel and a couple of salads. Everything on the menu is $10 or less.  It may not be the place to party, but it is a great spot to chill and have a conversation.  If you want to support a local business, and you like beer, and if you wanna play a life-sized Jenga game, all that and more is just north of Bell Rd. on 67th. Ave.

I have to knock it down to 4 stars but bump it up to 5 because it's still unlike anything else nearby and it reminds me of drinking at the VFW/American Legion.  If they manage to get the service issues handled time to look out for a bigger spot to expand into because at that point...their skills will be complete. Sometimes, service is slow, plates and glasses sit on the table way too long for my comfort level and there's not a lot of friendliness. No one is salty or rude, just a couple "not really warm" servers in rotation. Let's make N. Glendale fun, y'all! Be welcoming n shit! For now, the beers and the food and atmosphere make up for it as far as I'm concerned.  I'd drink their Sahti and Dubina Ale all day. The Blood Orange (when it comes back) is crazy good and the sour beers remind me of drinking kombucha instead of beer (I'm one of those freaks who loves kombucha). Recently they've had a blueberry and a pomegranate sour on tap. Try a flight if you're unsure.   The wings w hop sauce are my favorite wings in AZ. Thinking about them right now makes me crave those delicious chicken appendages and their tangy, slightly hot sauce. Their burgers and brats are pretty good, and they come served with ample crispy fries. I'd still have to recommend getting it started with a pretzel appetizer, however, I opt for the spicy mustard in lieu of the cheese. My personal preference, but your mileage may vary.  Dubina is great for getting a large group together and playing Cards Against Humanity or Jenga or to catch a Dbax or a soccer game on one of the TVs. Everything on the menu is $11 or cheaper and they don't mind splitting your bill.  Closed Mondays because it's still a family business. Come out and support a local business the next time you want a beer or a glass of wine!

Formerly known as "M sushi", Eastwind has some pretty solid offerings of the raw fish variety. Service was solid and the atmosphere and decor top the average stripmall sushi place.  Unless you like things very spicy and extremely capital H capital O capital T, order the honey wings to start off with, because the hot wings ain't no joke! I like it hot & this made me uncomfortable. These were food challenge order of intensity hot wings. Adam Richman should be eating these on the Travel Channel.  I was quickly able to cool down the fire in my grill with the tuna sashimi. Cool. Tender. Amazing. Kudos to whoever does the buying at the seafood market because the tuna was melt-in-your-mouth good. Just the right amount of bite to it and the flavor was outstanding. It was also a really large portion for only six dollars.  The crunch roll and spicy scallop roll - also pretty great. So was the yellowtail roll with scallions. Salmon skin hand roll...I'll skip it next time due to too much nori overwhelming the rest of the ingredients.   No doubt I'll be back here the next time I want a sake bomb and some sashimi.

My kind of food here - seafood steamed/boiled in spicy seasonings with an option for barbecue. This is one of those places where the bigger the group of people the better the value. You order by the pound, you share, and everyone gets messy together.  I brought a friend from back East and we both grew up on seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. We were looking forward to blue crabs but they were out. From the remaining seafood choices - and we decided to stick with seafood instead of barbecue - we chose shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs. Trifecta sauce, mild heat because our server, Dion, said that things run on the spicy side.  So, it's entirely possible that ordering Alaskan King crab legs at the angry crabshack and barbecue is a bit of a reach. I didn't care because I have to try them, right?  I wasn't disappointed in them, however, roasted and then split and served with drawn butter is just the best way to eat Alaskan King crab legs and now I know. Everything was delicious just the same and cooked just right. Nothin worse than rubbery overcooked skrimps and there was none of that here.   I couldn't pass up the sausage four-piece and I'm glad that I tried it because it is excellent. For me it was the most memorable part of the entire meal and I will be going back soon for more. I've got to try the barbecue as well. Whoever runs the smoker seems to know what they're doing with wood and low heat.

I've been for lunch, dinner and we've hired them to cater lunch for a meeting at my office and they serve delicious and high quality food every time.    The menu is Greco-American but not just gyros and fries. The salads are excellent- those with greens are ample and fresh and the pasta salad is incredible. The pasta salad is penne with a tangy dressing, with spring peas, feta and sun dried tomatoes. That combo really works- the peas are sweet to offset the bite of the tangy dressing and salty feta. A restaurant that pulls together a pasta salad with that much care for flavor, you know they do their grilled fare, pitas, sandwiches and pizzas right.   The pita is overflowing with chicken, gyro meat, steak- your choice- tomatoes and zesty red onions and the pita itself is so good, you'll want an extra one to dip into the house made tzatziki sauce.   Prices are not cheap, not gonna lie, but you do get what you pay for- great food, ample portions, in a clean, modern establishment staffed by a local family. It's a great lunch or dinner if you're counting calories because of all the healthy options. I'm a regular.

First to review, bitches!  I don't always shop at a store that's full of things to keep other things in, but when I do, I shop online at containerstore.com and then I pick it up here. Already pulled together by the store staff and bagged up for me.

The donuts and pastries are delicious and so is the Vietnamese coffee. Every time I bring my little one to work with me we drop by beforehand and when she sees the goodies in the glass-enclosed case, she makes the greatest "wow" face. The staff is incredibly patient helping her pick out what she wants because it's hard to make up your mind when everything looks incredible.   Whenever I'm here to pick something up on my way to work, they genuinely make me feel welcomed and half of the time I get a little something extra thrown in for free. I love supporting a local business and I hope Northern Perks remains open for years to come.

I'm letting all of you know that Angry Crab- Peoria, is now open!  They don't do barbecue or pizza like some of their sister restaurants in PHX, Mesa and the Tukee- here it's all about crab, shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, mussels, clams, oysters, po boys, catfish and several other things that swim.   Pro tip: dress down because you will get messy. Need to take a shower soon after dining messy. Might wanna drive through a car wash with the windows down messy. But it will be worth it. The staff is very friendly and if you need help tying up your bib, they'll hook you up.  It's across from Lee Lee, on Cactus, just west of 75th Ave and at least for now, only open for dinner from 4-10, 11pm on Fri & Sat. The atmosphere and vibe is so unlike anything else in the area, and of course, so is the menu.   I've been waiting on the "OPEN" sign in the front window to be turned on for about 4 months. It's a long overdue "interesting" addition to the neighborhood and I'm glad it's finally open!

I got to try Lou's delivery and dine at the Uptown Plaza restaurant twice before it officially opened and the pizza is every bit as good as the hype builds it up to be.  The crust is like the best savory pie crust you've ever tasted- it's flaky but firm, and buttery. It has to be strong to hold up to the volume of cheese, sausage and tomatoes on the Classic, because it's a lot of goodness heaped into this 'za! The flavors are not overwhelming, not spicy, not full of mysterious herbs. The sausage is mild, but like the tomatoes and the cheese, it's absurdly high quality and left alone to shine without much more than some fresh garlic, salt and pepper. You can, of course, add parm or red pepper flakes to your desired tastes.  Lou's cheese bread appetizer is enough for 6 people, with marinara for dipping. Salads are really good- the dressings are outstanding. Lou's tiramisu- not the typical trifle- pulls the cocoa, coffee and mascarpone confection's flavors together nicely and it's enough for two people or maybe four.  The portions are generous here, noticing that theme?  Decor has a lot of mid century modern look to it and it's a really cool and groovy space that fits right into this part of Phoenix. I'd like to steal stuff for my place, if I'm honest. Bar stools and light fixtures, then the tables.   I got a tour of the kitchen during one of my visits- four dozen pizza ovens, all expected to be going at once to keep up with demand from diners and to-go orders. They've brought in experienced crews from their Chicago stores and plan to expand aggressively in the Valley Of The Sun. Gotta wish them well on that because I'm a big fan.
