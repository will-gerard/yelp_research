First time trying this place not to happy. I ordered the Italian cheese stake and they gave me a Philly cheese stake! There was no line and only a couple people sitting at tables. So I don't know how they could of made the mistake of giving me the wrong sandwich. I was the only one waiting! I don't know what they are doing in the the kitchen. But they must smoking to much dope! Make sure you check what kind of sandwich you get before you leave the place.

I used to eat at this place a lot when I lived closer. The build your own burritos are bomb! You can pretty much have anything you want in it.

The burgers are really flavorful! They have plenty of great combinations you can chose from. This is a great place you can go and sit down with friends. And get a quick jucy burger. I'm a chief and I know good food. The French frys are sweet and salty and I think about them all the time. If you plan on going there around lunch time. Be prepared to wait in a line out the door.

I tried this place for the first time a week ago and I was really impressed. Everything was really fresh. I had the Gyro plate with rice. You can tell that they do really care about there customers. I can tell it was really clean and new. This place was built off tradition. Great place to stop into you want to get something fresh and quick.

This place is horrible! The wings suck and the service too! Luckily for us our waitress was the hottest one there. Never going back there again.

The deep dish pizza taste like home! I'm a huge deep dish pizza fan! I'm from Chicago myself. So I know good deep dish pizza when I have it. I don't like to many veggies on it because it gets soggy and takes a lot of flavor away from the sauce. So worth it!

First time I ate here, I was really impressed with how big the menu was. So many different choices of pasty's to chose from. They have a great selection of wine and beer to chose from also. Great date spot! Defiantly coming back to try the 5 other pasty's that I wasn't able to order.

OMG this place is amazing! I had the juiciest fall off the bone rib tips I have ever had! They really do know how to put the sole in the food. I also had the Mack And Chees and Collard Greens. I don't know how they do it, but they defiantly have something good going on in the kitchen. I only wish it was a little less expensive. I paid 15 dollars with out a drink. But I understand.... When you get quality food than it is going to cost you.

I had a great experience here. I had the Tri Tip sandwich. The meat was really tender. And Spicy BBQ sauce was amazing! Pretty reasonable priced menu and the food comes out pretty quick. Good place to hang out and get some food and drinks with friends before the night out in the town. My favorite part is that they have my favorite IPA on draft "Grapefruit Sculpin".
