Worst place I have been too. They get our order wrong every Single time we go there. They always are out of the most popular bagels. I have complained to the management thru phone, and email with no response. This is 3 minutes from my house but refuse to go there

went here for dinner and it was HORRIABLE. they had no meat really that only thing was some roast beef that was extremely hard, the taco salad and taco shells were stale, the featured dessert was hard; there was only one waiter working for the whole place. Very disappointed we all felt very ill after leaving. we don't be returning. Cost way TOOO much

This was my first time there, great pricing Lisa was amazing she listened and my hair looks great! I used to work in the industry and tend to be quite picky but everything was nice! Great pricing also

Went here on a Thursday night and there was a pretty long wait. When we walked in the lady who appeared to be the hostesses asked how many there were two of us she said it would be just a minute. Well that minute turned into 15 mins. Ok so we sit down and got a waitress who was obviously overwhelmed. She didn't know who was sat first. We told her to take care of the other couple who was sitting next to us. She came back and got our drink order. We were ready to order by then but she didn't ask until after she brought our drinks. Now all if those things aren't necessarily horrible, but that and this made it a bad experience.  She came back to get our food order.  I ordered a cheese enchilada with GREEN saunce no onions. And my boyfriend ordered the sampler platter with NO GUACAMOLE.  Since he is VERY allergic which he told her. So of course we were upset when we received our food. I received a cheese enchilada with RED sauce that tasted old and not good. And my boyfriends food had guacamole.  She dropped iff our food quickly and when she came back and we told her, she said she told them no guacamole and asked if she could take just the item's with it in and remake them.  So she did that but when he got them back they were still cold. When it came to my order she again said I told them green sauce. She said she wrote it down correctly and that I could see her ticket. I don't care if you wrote it down correctly. It obviously wasn't right so why would you bring it? I was starving and we had to pick up our kid so I didn't have mine remade. But the food was just awful. When she came to give us the bill she told us the manger (who we never spoke to nor did they come to apologize) gave us 20% off???  No one apologize for what happened just made excuses. We quickly left and we will be extremely reluctant to return. We have been here multiple times and it's never been bad.  I understand somethings but the way things were handled were horrible

I am extremely disappointed in the color service I received today at this Salon the color is very uneven even thought I paid extra for a toner. I have bleed marks and overall the color is just not Good. I worked in the hair is industry for a long time and would never let someone walk out knowing that it wasn't good.

The customer service here was horrible.  I am a avid michael kors shopper and I refuse to go back to this store. The First time I went in there was 2 weeks ago. No one greeted me when I walked in.  I looked around for about 15 mins before someone even asked it I was ok. I found a bag I loved once they knew I was going to buy something they were all over me. I purchased the bag and used itfor 2 days and the threading on the handle came off. I tried to take it back to get it replaced but since I didn't have the tags they wouldn't.  They said they could take if it was defective. Humm well if the the threading is comming off isn't that defective? I could not believe that they refused to do anything. I live over an hour away and drove there for nothing.

I had a great experience with the people here. We used them in the past to get my boyfriends windshield repaired and they were great so when my new car got a crack in the windshield I knew we needed to call them again they did everything with my pesky insurance company and came out and replaced my windshield within 2 days and they are fast! Very nice if we ever have any other windshield problems we know who we will call
