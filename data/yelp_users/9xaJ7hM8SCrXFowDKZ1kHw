We popped in for a small bite and drink. The Diamond Raspberry Lemon Drop was delicious, but it just went downhill from there. I ordered the tomato bruschetta, which was the worst I've ever had. The bread tasted stale and left this weird after taste in my mouth. I had no desire on finishing it. The tortilla chips and pesto hummus was rather dull as well. Pass.

The WORST dim sum I've ever tasted! I'm usually not a picky eater but the food was so bad, I left with an empty stomach since I couldn't bring myself to eat anymore crap.

We came by for brunch. This place was a lot bigger than I had expected. I love the open floor plan.   There wasn't much of a crowd but we decided to sit at the counter. I ordered a raspberry iced tea and a chipotle-raspberry turkey sandwich. I really enjoyed my sandwich! It was perfectly proportioned and the spread was very tasty.   A surprising factor, I'm not big on anything spicy but when my coworker had asked for Sriracha, she told me it was rather sweet. I didn't believe her so I tried it myself. I think it was their own special version. It was on the slightly sweeter side with a kick. Yum. Definitely ask for this sauce!
