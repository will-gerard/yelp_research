I set an appointment to bring my vehicle to Alexander's for a wheel alignment and battery change which seemed simple enough.   Upon arrival I spoke with Alexander, he had no idea I had an appointment. I explained to him for the 2nd time that I needed a wheel alignment and a battery change. He broke down the cost, but never offered to check the battery to see if it just needed a charge.  I walked him out to my car and explained in great detail how my vehicle had a anti-theft starter and physically showed Alexander how to start the vehicle. He verified he knew how to start the vehicle because he was "a professional".   An hour later I received a phone call from Alexander stating that he could not start my car after installing a new battery. I politely reminded Alexander about the anti-theft starter, but he said the starter was bad and that would cost only 399.99. I assured him that I didn't need a starter and I felt like I was being screwed. He got very defensive over the phone and finally told me to come pick up the car that he will not work on it. Alexander then hung up on me. I tried calling him back to ask what the issue was, but he yelled that he was putting my old battery back in the car and to come pick it up, again hung up on me.   I took off work to go and pick up my car which had no work done. When I got to the shop, Alexander didn't even look or talk to me, threw my keys on the counter and walked away. I went to my car expecting the worst and my car started perfectly, just like it did when I dropped it off. I checked under the hood to see if anything was touched. Low and behold not a single thing had been touched. He didn't install a new anything. I could still see the grime and dirt on the nuts of the battery.   I assume Alexander did not listen to a word I said about the anti-theft device and then tried to sell me parts that were not needed. I drove out of there and got the work done at Meineke, minus the battery because they were able to check it and determine it just needed charging.   I will never return to Alexander's auto. I tried to register a complaint with the BBB but they are not a registered business.   The treatment I received at Alexander's was the worst service I have ever experienced from a business and very, very far from professional.

Hands down the best specialty toy shop in the Phoenix area!   I have been a loyal customer of Toy Anxiety since they were Empire of Toys on 12th street. Each time I walk in, I'm instantly transported back to my childhood and amazed at the variety and selection of new/vintage action figures,prop replicas and many other items I could only dream of as a kid.   The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the products available in the shop and I have often been stuck in many nerd conversations while visiting.   If you're a serious or beginning collector, want some toys for your kids (the dollar bins are always ravaged by happy kids), or just want a blast from the past, Toy Anxiety is a place you want to check out if you haven't already.

Cox was great until I spoke with their customer service person Juan (Employee #1347). All I wanted to do was take some packages off that I currently have.  I'm paying the 150.00 cancellation charge and Cox can shove it!

"The best in town", this statement is obviously self proclaimed.   I've been in the shop previously, with no issues. I stopped in this evening to replace a heating coil on my SKY HIGH vaporizer pen. I was embarrassed and shocked at the behavior of the announced "owner of the store for over 10 years".   For those who don't know, SKY HIGH micro pens are essentially a clone of the micro g pen, even made by the same manufacturer. I've done extensive research on these pens to obtain the lowest cost possible. (Write that down)  I walked in the shop and was greeted by the owner who asked if I needed help finding anything. I explained I needed a coil to fit a micro g pen. The owner directed me to a case with some generic pen parts, and a few Atmos pens, then went about his business. A few minutes later he asked if there was something he could help me with. Again I explained I needed the coil for my pen.   The owner showed me a few parts that wouldn't work with my pen and said that I did not have a correct piece (??), and that my battery was "generic", and will never work with micro g parts. This statement from the owner was questionable, because after about a year of experience with the g pen, and the sky high pen, I can say with confidence the parts are compatible with each other (Write that down). The owner wanted to unscrew my pen and sell me a part that will not work with my pen in any way, shape, or form. I told him my pen does not even unscrew and the g pen coil is not set up to receive the g tank, which is the part he wanted to screw in my pen. The owner was clearly getting upset at this point, and his interest in obtaining my money was fading fast.   From here, the owner had nothing left to do but tell me to leave his store, and call me a "fu**ing prick", I looked at him and asked "are you serious?", he continued to flip out and tell me to leave his store. As I said, I was embarrassed and shocked at the behavior of the owner.   The bottom line is that the shop did not have the part I needed. This guy has no knowledge of the vaporizer pen market today. He even told me the reason they don't carry this particular part was that because the micro g pen is outdated and no one uses them anymore. Seriously? Let's get real here.   Here are a few words of advice for your business moving forward. If you don't have a part available, maybe try and up sell the customer to another pen, or try and find a part that is compatible with what the customer has. Literally, this is how every other smoke shop carrying vape pens works these days. The customer is here to give you money for your services, calling them a "fu**ing prick" and kicking them out of your store prompts negative reviews and loss of revenue in the long run. You need to grow up and act like a mature business owner. If you've owned the shop for 10 years, you have not shown it. You act as if you were a school boy.   After I left your shop I went to another on my way home. I'm happily enjoying my new vape ape as I type this review... Oh yeah, you're shop does not carry vape ape, only the generic globes, so I highly doubt you have any idea what I'm talking about anyway.   The shop does have a few displays of Ironlak, and Montana paints, but seriously, what graf shop doesn't at this point? Laughable supply of paints in stock.   I will never return to this shop, and I highly encourage others to stay clear of this hole in downtown. It is a well below Trails quality.
