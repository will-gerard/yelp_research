Chips are stale and some were quite rubbery. I think they are cooking them in too low of a temperature oil. Salsa is delicious though. A great chipotle flavor to the hot salsa. I had the two taco meal. One chicken and one shredded beef. They were ok. Nothing to rave about. Overall, a solid 2 star place. Worth the money I guess.

I had the Carnitas burrito. It was hands-down the worst Carnitas burrito I've ever had in my life. Maybe everything else tastes pretty good but that was disgusting.

Absolutely the most frustrating place I have ever gone to eat. They are charging $12 for a frozen burger patty that they won't cook anything less than medium well. That says to me that their meat quality sucks and any hamburger that you are charging $12 for, should be choice meet that is freshly made every day not frozen. Too bad the business owner of this place knows very little about good quality food at good prices.  And second no matter how many Wings you order you can only get one flavor. You cannot split up your wings in the multiple flavors. This is extremely frustrating for anyone who is new to this place and would like to try a couple of different flavors but not ordered a ton of wings. You can order 12 wings for $10 or 24 wings for $18. But you cannot order 24 wings with two different flavors at $18. You have to do two separate orders of 12 wings at $10 an order. Am I taking crazy pills or does this place need a complete renovation on their business policies? It's really too bad that this place does not cater to the customer.  I will not be returning no matter what. Unless some business policies are changed the price of the hamburgers go down or the quality of the meet goes up. Freakin frozen patties??? Costco anyone?

The owners here are super nice and the food is really delicious. I tried the Korean beef sandwich and it was unbelievably delicious. Their chicken rice soup is really good too.

Great food. The flavors are wonderful, but the "so called" salsa they give you with your chips is watered down verde sauce like something you get from Taco Bell. They don't even offer other types of salsa you could pay for except quacamole. Overall, a 4...  Make real salsa though.

Amazing, flavorful, delicious, mouthwatering, best, mouth-gasm...  These are a few words that popped into my head while eating here. Their food is amazingly flavored and well made. I would eat here everyday if I were closer. One downside is that they have a "no firearms allowed" sign on their door. That's the only thing that pissed me off. Buuuuuut... I did come here for food, not target practice.

Attention to detail is what sets a company like this kind apart from their competition.  And they are worth every penny. Downside is once you go, you may develop an addiction. Be careful! They are amazing!

I would highly recommend anybody stay away from here. They rip you off big time. There are multiple companies around the valley and around the country that do the same work for sometimes 1/10 the price. I plan on reporting this to the BBB and I will never use them again. Between my wife and I we spent over $7000. My wife got her Brazil and upper lip done. I got my happy trail, my nipples, and my neck and cheeks. For 3500 at simplicity laser I could've had my whole body lasered. I learned my lesson and from now on I will be going to simplicity laser instead.

For Mediterranean-style food this place is awesome! They have a huge variety of food and it all tastes really good. The flavors are perfect and when you get a plate, it will be more than enough food for anyone.

I've had my car repaired at multiple places over the last six years of traveling for work. I drive around 4000 to 6000 miles per month, so inevitably I get in at least one wreck per year. Service king did a terrible job on the repair of my vehicle. Not only are there drip marks in the paint and they are refusing to fix that, they also did not attach the undercarriage correctly and it detached while I was driving on the highway and completely destroyed it. They are telling me that that is my fault and that is up to me to replace on my own, because of their failed ability to deliver me a car that was accurately put back together.  Terrible customer service... Anyone who reads this, go somewhere else. It's not that they can't do good work, it's that when they do bad work, they pass the buck on to somebody else and blame it on somebody else and don't fix the problems that they cause.  Needless to say, I will never ever ever return to service king for any work whatsoever.  45 minutes later-I just went to my local volkswagen dealer and they confirmed that it is impossible for the undercarriage to detach the way that mine did just from curbing my bumper on a slow U-turn which is what I did. And service king is trying to tell me that the undercarriage detached because of that. Once again, they pass the buck and don't take responsibility for their poor workmanship.

Needless to say, I will never ever ever return to service king for any work whatsoever.   5 days later - and now both of my headlights have stopped working. I travel for a living so driving at night is kind of imperative to my job. This botched job needs to get fixed and it needs to happen sooner rather than later.  Update - 1/16/16 I took my car back in today and the manager in charge of repairs actually gave me the time of day and took my car into the back to put it up on the stand and take a look at it. Once he had assessed the issues, he brought me to the back and showed me what he found. He's going to help me get them replaced I'm going to buy the parts. He needs to be promoted to GM or service manager. He showed he cared. The other guys were too worried about passing the buck that they failed to try to put themselves in my shoes for a second.

Update - I brought my car in to get the headlights fixed and of course Gary and Kevin give me crap. However, Ferman, the guy with common sense customer service skills, (he should be promoted to GM or Customer Service VP) simply said he would look at the car, he took it to the back, put it up on the stand, showed me where something had hit my under carriage and most likely, causes it to get loose and then because a piece of the grill was missing, some air probably pushed the valence downward while driving.  I agreed to pay for the parts needed, since it makes sense, and they are going to fix the lights. I'm in here right now. Ferman is the kind of person that needs to train Gary and Kevin in customer service.
