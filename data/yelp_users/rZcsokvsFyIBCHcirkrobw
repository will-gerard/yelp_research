Imagine this: I had just driven 3 days from Minnesota to Arizona.  I knew that my favorite coffee shop in Minnesota, Caribou Coffee, didn't exist in the desert southwest.  Tired, a bit intimidated, and craving coffee, I find my first local Starbucks about 2 miles from where I live.  I park my car and walk up to the store, and from the moment the coffee aroma hit me, I knew I had found a place I could get away, drink great coffee, and relax reading my book, just like I had done back home.  The baristas (at least 2 or 3 of them) are extraordinarily friendly.  I had an extended conversation with one about Near Eastern and Asian culture and languages, which blew my mind. That had never happened to me before, and it brought a profound joy to my heart.  I had spent nearly 30 years in MN and I had never encountered such friendly staff *anywhere*, not even in the coveted "uptown" area of Minneapolis (known for being down to earth, organic, open minded folks).  I felt immediately welcomed in a strange land, one in which I wasn't yet comfortable.  I don't have much money, but this Starbucks gets what little dollars I do have; it gives me an escape, a feeling that I am "home", and that sense of community I so dearly miss.  I've spend many hours in their cushy chairs, either applying for jobs on my laptop, or reading a book out of my favorite series.  I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't found this Starbucks in my first few days in Arizona.  I know, many of you would say, "Gee, Starbucks?  Really?  Couldn't you have found a more local coffee shop?"  No.  I couldn't have.  I'm broke, and I have no internet access where I live.  To stumble upon this shop was awesome; I was never a fan of Starbucks when I lived in MN, but now, I'm a huge fan.  At certain hours of the day, you can't find a place to sit, but that makes it all the more warm and friendly.  People here don't seem to mind if you sit directly next to them when it's busy (Minnesotans apparently really like their personal bubble).  I give it 2 thumbs up, but you'll have to see it for yourself.  I may be merely a lonely traveler looking for something familiar, but I was impressed with the service, the friendly faces, the product and the cleanliness of this coffee shop.

I love this place!  It is so much better than the big chain mail places.  The staff is truly friendly and really care about you as a person, rather than just a customer.  It has a small town feel to it, you can sense it from the moment you walk in the door.  It's personal service with a smile and the care of family.  Not the fanciest but great service!  I've gone there several times to send a fax or send a package, and it's wonderful!  Even though I don't live in Gilbert anymore, I would definitely go out of my way to be a patron of theirs.

I guess I was expecting more service-wise from this store. I ordered a class ring online to commemorate my upcoming graduation for my master's degree. I was very excited to see it.  I went to pick it up the night of 3/20/13. I had been having the worst day, so I looked like crap: puffy face from crying, red eyes, hair a mess. I didn't realize I'd be judged by my appearance by the sales staff.  I walked into the store, and stood there for a minute as the man working just stared at me. No greeting. Finally I said "Hello?" And he almost laughed at me, implying that I could not possibly be a customer. I told him I was picking up an order I placed online, and as I said that, a family walked in. He walked away from me and assisted them instead!! What?? It would have taken 2 minutes to help me and send me on my way, but instead I was left to wait, even though I had been there first. A woman, who also worked there, came out from the back, and both of these employees decided to help the newcomers, and leave me to wait, boiling in anger at this point. Once he got back to me, he looked at me like I was scum, and tried to sell me something else.  Are you kidding me? After treating me like crap, you expect me to buy something else from you? Please. I took my ring and left. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the ring is nice. The lack of service deserves zero stars. I will never shop here again.

I went to Las Vegas in August 2012 for opening night of Wicked, and everything about my experience blew me away!  From the parking lot attendants to the bar staff to the ushers, it was just amazing.  Plus, the place is stunning.  Polished marble floors, sweeping and winding stairs, plush velvet, it was posh.  I felt I got a great value, too, because I had purchased a ticket to the opening night of Wicked for only $15.  Wow!  If I lived in Las Vegas, I would go to every show this place puts on.  They are a class act!  And affordable to those of us who don't have a ton of cash.  Highly recommended!

One of the things I was most excited about when I moved to Arizona, besides Jack in the Box (judge me if you want, I LOVE their tacos) was Someburros.    I had my first Someburros meal back in 2009 when I came to Arizona as a tourist.  I fell in love with their menu... so cheap yet soooo good.  Thus, when I moved here, I decided to high tail it to my local restaurant.  It was good, but not as good as I remember.  Maybe it was the dish I got, though.  I got the veggie burrito and it seemed... dry.  The tortilla was dry and the burrito wasn't full enough, so it was mostly just dry tortilla.  I may try a meat filled burrito next time, just to see if it was the type of burrito I ordered.  The chips and salsa are excellent tho!  So is the side dishes you get with a combo meal: Spanish rice and refried beans.  Their refried beans are very good, the best you'll get from a "fast food" restaurant.  That's another thing... I put fast food in quotes because the only thing that makes it fast  food is the speed with which you get the food.  And the fact that the food comes on disposable plates and with plastic cutlery.    Wonderful place, glad I went... but the next time I go, if I get a generously filled burrito in a tortilla that didn't seem microwaved, I'll review Someburros again and give them 5 stars!

I've been getting delivery from this restaurant for as long as I've lived at my current apartment in Mesa, AZ (over a year) and I've really loved the food and the delivery driver's service.  Tonight stood out for me, though.  I've been having a really bad week, so I decided to order a pizza this evening so I wouldn't have to bother making dinner.  When the delivery driver showed up, she was just a ball of sunshine.  So friendly and smiling.  (Plus, I was delighted to see a girl doing this job, as I myself have been a girl delivery driver for many years, so I have a deep respect for girls who do it.)  Her smile and genuine friendliness made my day 100% better.  Thanks for making my day, and delivering the best thin crust pizza, ever!

This was the first sushi restaurant I have visited in years, and the very first one I've visited in Arizona.  The friend I went with said it was the best sushi restaurant in the east valley (some poll or other said so), thus we decided to take a stab at it.  And, to be honest, I mainly wanted to taste miso soup again (one of my favorite soups on the planet).  We walked in and it looked like any typical asian restaurant.  To one side was a long bar, where you can sit and eat, or sit and drink saki or beer.  To the other side was a long row of booths.  We decided to booth it up.  We sat down and shrugged... seemed fine so far.  The decor looked a little cheap, but the more hole-in-the-wall a place is, the more likely I will like it.  So, we both order a Japanese beer, take out the sushi list, and just go to town.  We order just about one of everything, including bowls of miso soup.  I was surprised that the sushi came out one at a time.  We'd dig into one, and once we were almost done and forming our opinions about it, another one would come out.  That was kinda fun.  Every kind we decided to get was exquisite, and reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in Minneapolis, Kikugawa (and believe you me - I've tried EVERY sushi restaurant in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area).  Not only was the sushi tasty but it was *beautiful*.  They must have really talented sushi chefs working for them, because it was wonderful.  This was also the first time I got "deep fried" sushi.  If you haven't tried it... DO IT!  We got a deep fried roll that had crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, and rice... wow.  Mind blown (can you tell I really love certain things??).  If I can find other friends who would like to go out to a sushi restaurant in the east valley, this restaurant will definitely be revisited by me!  (Plus, surprise, they gave us free dessert!  Yay watermelon!)

I'd give this place zero stars if I could. Let me set the scene: I sleep during the day and a loud knock interrupts my slumber. By the time I get to the door, the person is gone, but a letter is shoved into the crack of my door. The name on the envelope makes no sense to me, so I open it. It's a court summons for a guy I've never heard of, at an address that isn't mine. Really? The guy who delivered this must be REALLY bright, because I'm on the odd numbered side of the street, and this guy being summoned address is on the even side of the street. Derp. So, I call the number on the letter, like the good, law abiding citizen I am, to let them know they made a mistake and should probably resend the summons so this guy knows he has to show up in court. The lady I got on the phone was a complete, how should I put this eloquently... Oh yeah, a total b**ch. She made ME feel like a criminal, although I was only trying to be helpful. She told me if I didn't do anything with the letter, it's be like I was holding someone else's mail. What? Your guy delivered it to the wrong address and I'M in the wrong? So effed up! Although I don't think I should have to take any action at all, because this is literally NOT my problem, I'll send it back to the court house, only because I feel for the guy who would miss the court date if I didn't. If someone from the court is reading this right now, feel free to contact me, because I am furious at the way I was treated over the phone for trying to be a kind and responsible citizen.
