This is where I was born! 28 years later I'm back to support my mother through surgery. I thought hospitals were dark and depressing but Banner Good Samaritan changed all that. The hospital is bright and sunny and the staff is genuinely nice and helpful. I would recommend this hospital to anyone.

Some girl I know said she went to China Chili and it was the best Chinese food she's ever had. After she told me that I went to China Chili the next day. The menu is standard for a Chinese restaurant nothing special. We ordered some beef dish for our meal and a side of chow mein. The beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland. I do not understand why people love China Chili. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!

I have never had to wait for a table at this location and the service is always great. The first time I ate here I was so overwhelmed by the menu there are so many options and all of them sound great. This isn't an authentic Italian restaurant but I like how they make all the classic dishes with a twist . The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. The food here is pretty good try the Boom Dip as an appetizer and don't forget to leave room for the Pizookie its heavenly.

CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe is a charming little restaurant located in Central Phoenix. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. They serve both Asian and Italian cuisine here but I haven't had the balls to order anything from the Italian menu. The last time I ate here with my boyfriend we ordered a spicy tuna roll, spicy pot stickers, and Korean spicy beef with noodles. Service was great and everything we ordered exceeded our expectations. Our bill was less than $30 including drinks! This is my favorite Asian restaurant to eat at because of the variety and the quality of the food.

I stopped by for happy hour on my birthday we went to the bar downstairs and it was really dark it kind of reminded me of a dungeon. Happy hour here is amazing! We ordered crab tostadas, onion rings, mushroom brie bruschetta, and steak tacos. Everything was delicious you definitely get your moneys worth here! The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a martini menu and the bartenders didn't know how to make any of the drinks I wanted except for bacardi and diet . I loved the atmosphere it was upscale yet down to earth and the food was amazing. Where else can you get bacon wrapped shrimp for $5?

After hearing this restaurant was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives I suggested we take our friend here for her birthday because she LOVES Italian food. The restaurant was empty when we arrived and I was surprised how small the restaurant is. The guy behind the counter told us to take a seat so we did. We sat there for about 10 minutes and nothing. Do we order at the counter? My sister told me to ask but the guys behind the counter didn't even understand me when I asked if they had a restroom. Finally someone came over and asked what we wanted to drink and placed our order. We started out with the bruschetta, garlic bread, and some kind of cheesy pasta balls that were not very flavorful. The bruschetta was great and the garlic bread was good too. I asked for a side of marinara to dip my garlic bread in and it was really good. I am still daydreaming about that marinara sauce. Mmmm! My sister ordered spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered spaghetti carbonara with pancetta and egg, and the birthday girl ordered tortellini alfredo. Their portions were very small compared to my dish and I felt kind of bad. It looked like they got the kiddie portion! Despite the skimpy portions and spotty service everything tasted homemade and delicious.

I needed to get an extra key made but I was in a rush and didn't want to go walk through a big store like Walmart to get one made. Some lady at the gas station told me I should go to Ace Hardware. They had tons of different designs to choose from and i settled on a key with rhinestones on it. I was tempted to get another one made for my roommate but I was in a rush. I was in and out in 5 minutes!

I stopped by Keegan's to eat corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day. I've never ordered this dish before so I didn't know if I was going to like it or not. I ended up loving it!  The corned beef was lean and tender and the veggies were perfectly seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I'd definitely come back to try other items on the menu.

The $20 bruschetta board and bottle of wine deal is too good to pass up even though I think the bruschetta here isn't that great. The bread is too chewy and I felt like I was fighting with it just to get a bite. Our waiter was fantastic. We got there a little before 8 and asked if it's too early to get the $20 deal and he said "I'll make it happen". He was genuinely nice and gave us several different wines to taste. I'd rather go to Kazimierz but I will definitely come back here on a Monday or Tuesday to take advantage of the wine and bruschetta deal.

I was in desperate need for a haircut and I needed to get in a salon right away. I called salon surreal to ask how much a haircut costs there and when they told me $50 I thought that was really expensive but they were able to fit me in right away so i made an appointment. I usually pay about $30 including tip so I was wondering why they charge so much for haircuts.  My appointment was with Tasia and she was awesome. She asked me what kind of cut I wanted and I told her to do whatever she thinks will look good on me. Next step was washing my hair and she gave me a great head massage it was so relaxing I wanted to take a nap. Tasia did a great job with the cut and style and gave me tips on different ways to style my hair. She also showed me some products that I should use but wasn't pushy about selling them to me.  I really enjoyed getting my hair cut at Salon Surreal and now I understand why they charge $50 for a haircut. The stylists that work there are experienced and know their stuff.

I started calling nail salons at 6:50 pm asking what time they close and they all said 7 and hung up on me until I called Tammy's. The lady who answered the phone was so sweet and told me to come in even though they were closing in 10 minutes. I got a pedicure and my eyebrows waxed. I was happy with the end result of the pedicure but  the lady could have given a better massage. I was also happy with my eyebrows and the lady who did them didn't give me a dirty look when I gave her feedback of what I wanted. The salon is average nothing fancy but I will definitely come back for the fabulous customer service which always wins in my book.

I have a love hate relationship with this bar. I love the drinks specials but I hate the crowd. My friends love this bar so I come here for moral support and for some reason I can't pass up .25 cent drinks. For .25 cents you get what you pay for you probably get half a shot per drink but after 3 or 4 of these suckers you should have a good buzz. There is a weird mix of people here you've got the cowboys, hoochies, thugs, Scottsdale brats, and some regular people here and there. If you're young and single this is a good bar to hook up I always see people getting freaky on the dance floor. Stay for the bikini contest at midnight its very entertaining.

I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off.

This location is in the hood but I don't care. I will go anywhere for Carolina's tacos! I don't know what they do to the tacos here but they are like crack. I could eat them everyday! With rice and beans and a side of sour cream. I can't get myself to order anything else. This Mexican food joint lives up to the hype.

I will admit Mims serves up some seriously good food BUT the place is really small and super ghetto. You have to walk through a screen door then open the front door to get in like your walking into someones house( in the ghetto of course). When you get in its hotter inside than it is outside and it does NOT smell good. I walked into the bigger room on the side where the the games are and it smelled like a cat was living back there! I ordered a chili dog and french fries with an iced tea. They put real shredded cheese on the chili dog not the artificial cheese and the french fries were crispy and tasted great with ranch. The food makes up for the poopy atmosphere and if you eat here make sure you place your order to go.

I like this mall alot it has so much in one place! Gameworks, IMAX, Rainforest cafe, Saks Fifth Avenue outlet, Neiman Marcus last call outlet, Bebe, Ross, Marshalls,Guess, Pacific Sunwear, Sanrio and many more just too much to mention.   The only downside is that there are a lot of ghetto people and kids running around. I couldn't walk anywhere without someone running into me it was very annoying.

The food here is kind of pricey but you get what you pay for. I love the chips and salsa here but I don't get why they serve their chips and salsa in weird containers that make it hard to eat. It's so frustrating! They also serve you your food piping hot so make sure to let it sit for a minute or else you are going to burn your mouth. Other than that the servings are big and the food is great.

They give you bean dip with your chips and salsa here and sometimes that is the only reason why I choose to eat here. I heart chips and salsa! I have never had a bad meal here and the fish tacos are really good. After looking at all the other reviews I am obviously the minority when I say I heart Arriba!

My cousin lives across the street from Los Compadres. I was starving and decided to give it a shot. I called and placed my order to go. A red chile burrito with a side of cheese and sour cream. I got there and was shocked my burrito was only $5! Usually restuarants charge an arm and a leg for side items. I asked the girl for an iced tea to go and she gave it to me for free! I thought that was really sweet of her so I gave her a nice tip. I was very pleased with my food and I would't hesitate to come back. The restaurant isn't fancy just a good solid place to get cheap tasty Mexican food.

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the side. The bean and cheese burrito was just as good as a Mission tortilla filled with Rosarita refried beans. The chips and salsa were okay. It boggles my mind that so many people love this restaurant when there are better options in the area such as La Condesa, Gallo Blanco, or Macayo's. You couldn't pay me to eat here again.

Our designated driver wanted to come here after the bar. I didn't know what Encounters was so when everyone in the car explained it was a sex club/swingers bar I expected the worst. I'm not a prude but I am a one man woman and the thought of going to a club and hooking up with a stranger creeps me out. Downstairs looks like a strip club there is a stage with stripper poles and upstairs there's a room where you can get your freak on while people watch you. I sat in the waiting room and read New Times. I know I'm lame.

Caramba's is a great spot to get some tasty Mexican food at a reasonable price. I love that they make everything fresh and use all white meat chicken. I think the food here is better than most Mexican restaurants in town. My only complaint is that the free chips always taste stale but I always eat them anyways!

I know Macayo's isn't authentic but it is damn good! The chips and salsa here are great I always ask for their hot sauce because its better than the mild. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I recommend ordering something with baja sauce. It's amazing and I always order a side of it with my meal. I love the food but this restaurant needs to be remodeled. The carpet is old and the tables are worn out. At least keep your restaurant up to date when you are charging $12 an entree.

I was excited to try this place out after reading all the good reviews but torn about whether I like this place or not. I ordered a plate with steak, beans, rice, plantains, chorizo, and sliced avacado. I could have cooked everything on the plate and it probably would have tasted better. It was my first time trying plantains and I thought they tasted a little sour. I didn't like them but I boxed them up and gave them to my dad and he thought they were delicious. I had a couple of bites of my sisters tamales and wished I ordered that instead. I am not a fan of tamales by any means but these tamales rocked my world. I will be back for more. We ordered a mango souffle for dessert and the father that works there told the son to make us take it to go in Spanish like we didn't know what he was saying. I thought it was funny because he smiled at us the whole time like we didn't know what he was saying. I am giving this restaurant four stars because I cannot stop thinking about those damn tamales! I'm gonna come back, order some tamales, and try some other things on the menu and maybe I'll bump it up to five stars.

Santisi Brother's has awesome pizza and the best calzone I have ever had. I can't eat them anywhere else and I crave one about once a week.  There are tons of tv's covering the walls in the main dining room so if you love sports and enjoy watching several games at once this place is for you. The only problem I have here is that the waitresses give better service if you are a guy or with a guy. Ayesha is right though there are always cute boys here! One offered to buy me a sea monster shot and I fell in love. Aaaah!

The first place I've ever tried Greek food was Pita Jungle and I've been hooked ever since. However I have found that the mom and pop places can be a hit or miss. King Gyro's is a HIT .  I have had their tabouli, hummus, dolmas, chicken gyro, and fajita pita and never once have I been dissappointed.  NATHAN S was not exaggerating about the tzaziki sauce I eat it with EVERYTHING!

We showed up after they stopped serving breakfast but they said we could order off the breakfast menu anyways. Off to a good start! The hard part was deciding what to order. I asked the waiter to lead me in the right direction and he said his favorite was the white flannel. I am a huge fan of corned beef so I ordered that and topped it off with some cheese. My other dining companions ordered monkey cakes and a garlic mushroom omelet. I had a bite of the monkey cakes and they were ok no big deal but the garlic mushroom omelet was awesome. My corned beef has was perfect and I ate all of it! I was really impressed with this restaurant. Orange Table is my new obsession!

I recommend Kona for their American menu but skip the sushi! I ordered a Vegas roll a long time ago and it was horrible! I vowed to never come back until my friend Danielle told me that they have other items on the menu like salads, sandwiches, pasta, and burgers. I caved in and agreed to meet her for lunch at Kona. We shared some cheese and bacon fries. I ordered chicken pesto pasta and she ordered a club sandwich. A friend met up with us while we were having lunch and they gave him a huge slice of red velvet cake for his birthday! Friendly service and great food. What more can you ask for? I am now a huge fan of Kona and I can't wait to come back!

We stopped by Gilligan's on our way to Martini Ranch.  We were having a good time taking pictures on the swinging chair and when I tried to get off the chair my purse knocked my drink over. The bartender made me another drink for free! I thought that was really nice and Gilligin's was cool in my book. I was having a good time until an employee accused me of puking in the bathroom. I told her I didn't puke in the bathroom and she said "Like you would tell me if you did" I asked her if she was the puke patrol and she kicked me out. Good thing she doesn't have a job where she has to use her judgment because she is not the sharpest tool in the shed. She also made me hate this bar because they have nothing but idiots working here. Except for the guy who gave me a free drink.

I got over my grudge with Giligin's and have been back a few times. I like to stop by, buy a tray of jello shots, and spin the wheel of booze. Bartenders here are either really cool or really mean. Just expect them to be mean so if you get a nice one you'll be pleasantly surprised. The midget here never fails to amuse me. My ex used to tell me they smell like pennies. Whatever that means....Everything about this bar is obnoxious. If you're into that sort of thing stop by and check it out!

I came here for happy hour and left a happy camper. Everything on the menu sounded great and we finally decided on the queso con carnitas and the big ass burger. The appetizer was very flavorful the only thing I didn't like is that there was more meat than queso so it was kind of hard to eat. The big ass burger was the best burger I have ever had. It came with chipotle mayo that wasn't very flavorful but the burger didn't need anything added on to it. The meat was amazing and melted in your mouth. I ate half of the burger and was full for the rest of the night.

Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.

Ra is a sushi bar located on Mill Ave so it is usually busy and packed with college students. The atmosphere is trendy and loud so if you're looking for a quiet meal go somewhere else. My boyfriend and I ate here last night because they have a reverse happy hour every Sunday night from 8pm to 11pm. We sat at the bar and ordered some pineapple wontons. You get four wontons, they are filled with onions and cream cheese, and it comes with pineapple sauce. They were okay but nothing to brag about. We also ordered a yellowtail roll and crispy spicy tuna. The roll was good and the crispy spicy tuna was amazing! Overall I was pleasantly surprised the food was so good and the service was great as well.

I shared the sampler platter with my boyfriend. We chowed down on jalapeno poppers, onion rings, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and wings. I never knew bar food could taste this good! I loved the down to earth atmosphere, great food, and reasonable prices. I can't wait to come back and try the Philly sandwiches!

There were kids all over the place I felt like I just walked into a high school dance. They had specials on Jager bombs and Coors light but they "ran out" of Coors light on tap. The floors were sticky and the whole bar smelled like rotten chicken wings. It was a nightmare. Every Thursday they have a wet t-shirt contest. Some guy asked my cousin if she was going to participate and I told him she won the last time and they won't let her compete again. Wrong answer! Some girl started going on and on about how she has won the last 8 times because of her fake boobs. Hey those things aren't gonna pay for themselves! She also said the last prize was $100 and a dildo. Classy.

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw that Country Market had a deli here. I picked up a roast beef sandwich and some potato salad. When I was eating it my friend said it sounded like I was having a mouth orgasm because I moaned after every bite! If  you live in the area and haven't been here yet try the sandwiches they're great.

Virginia's house is an old victorian house located in historic downtown Glendale. I attended a wedding here and I thought that the venue was very charming. The house was decorated for Christmas and I think it added a magical touch on that special day. Natalie (the coordinator) was very nice and made sure everything went smoothly. She even helped us figure out how to tie up the corset on the brides wedding dress! My friend bragged about how inexpensive the wedding was so I would definitely recommend Virgina's house for brides to be on a budget. The only downfall of having an event here is the location. It's not in the best neighborhood and while my friend was having her wedding we could here people at the Hispanic church across the street. I also caught the next door neighbor peeking through the fence! Regardless of those minor issues I will tell everyone about Virginia's house for weddings, receptions, and other special occasions.

I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place. While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews. Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me. The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking " Dammit Arik B was right"!

I ate here for dinner for the first time last night and I loved it. I was immediately impressed walking in it seemed like everything sparkled. The decor inside was simple, modern, and chic. It made me feel like I wasn't in Arizona anymore. Everything on the menu looked great and I ended up ordering the grilled cheese sandwich with a salad on the side. The food here is really good. I would come back for the side salad that came with my sandwich. I loved the salad so much I forgot I ordered a sandwich! AZ88 is a beautiful restaurant filled with beautiful people and I was surprised that the prices were so reasonable. I think this is a great date spot if you want to impress your date bring him/her here.

Scottsdale Fashion Square mall is always my first choice when it comes to shopping because they have a wide range of stores and the customer service in every store I've been in is awesome. The sales people are helpful, never pushy, and It doesn't matter if I am in Burberry or Buckle I always get an honest answer to "How does this look"? Every time I leave the mall I feel good about my purchases and that's what keeps me coming back! Oh and five stars because they opened up an Arden B in the new wing. The shopping gods must have heard my prayers!

I grew up in the neighborhood and for some reason I thought Chino Bandido was a buffet. I was way off! I can't believe I waited so long to eat here but I am a little worried about my addiction to their chile relleno burrito. I think Chino Bandido made a deal with the devil when they created the best chile relleno ever! Its not your average chile relleno made with an egg its more like a giant jalepeno popper. I get it every time I come here with a veggie quesadilla and top it off with their yummy salsa. I am also obsessed with the snickerdoodle cookies and I don't really like cookies. The ordering system is kind of weird but if you act like its your first time there they'll just fill it out for you ;)

Cibo is a great place to bring someone who doesn't know about it already you'll score some cool points for being in the know. I love the concept of a restaurant set in a historic house that in itself is cool in its own right  and the food is tasty but the service is horrible! The waiter comes to your table takes down your order and is never to be seen again till your done with your food. Grrrrr! Despite the bad service I still come back for more because i'm obsessed with the bruschetta here.  The appetizer comes with three different types of bruschetta tomato, cheese with prosciutto, and some weird bean stuff  weird but tasty. The pizza is pretty good too but I think the sauce tastes a little like ragu...really :)

Mamma Mia serves cheap delicious Italian food. Every time I come here I order a slice of pizza with ranch and penne al la mamas which is the pasta of the gods in case you didn't know! If you love alfredo sauce you will love this pasta. The ranch here is really good too! I wish I lived in the area so I could eat here more often.

The majority of people who come here look like they've all been on The Dirty. The girls here dress super slutty and have no shame and the guys are not afraid of embarrassing themselves to get your attention.They don't come here to hang out they come here to party like rock stars and it makes for great people watching. This place represents everything that's wrong with Scottsdale but I can't get enough of it.

I was in the downtown area and needed to have a good breakfast so I headed over to Matt's. I heard the food served here is organic and local whenever possible so I wanted to check it out. I was surprised how small this restaurant is but it doesn't feel stuffy or cramped inside. There was no wait when we arrived around 8 am and we were immediately seated. My cousin and I ordered the same thing coffee, chorizo and eggs with jalapenos, and hash browns. We downed a couple of cups of coffee and our meal arrived. The service was fast and they did a great job of keeping our coffee cups filled up.  I noticed the ketchup had a sweet taste to it I looked at the bottle and it was Heinz ketchup. It didn't taste like Heinz! I wonder if they add something extra to it ? The food is good but the atmosphere makes you feel at home and I think that's why many people come back.

I'm sure you're asking how good can breakfast be? At Matt's it's the little things that count. Instead of giving you a piece of bread from a bag they give you a huge piece of fresh baked bread with real butter and homemade preserves. The organic eggs they use to make breakfast taste amazing and the syrup here puts Aunt Jemima to shame! Want to avoid the horrible wait everyone talks about? At Matt's the early bird gets the worm. Arrive between 6am-8am and you won't have to wait.

Monday night attract a bros and hos crowd that thinks they are better than everyone else with a few cool people mixed in. The bar is small and there is nowhere to sit so prepare to stand all night. I will only come here on a Monday because there is nowhere else to go.

My first time at Ticoz I ordered the peach salad and it the best salad I have ever had. It's so delicious and flavorful. My second time here I thought about getting something else but I just couldn't do it. Peach salad please! Before our meal we snacked on the chorizo queso dip and the salsa trio. It was so good we finished that off in no time.  My sister ordered the tamales with beans and rice. She wasn't a fan of the food because she said it had a chipotle taste to it. To be honest I didn't think her food looked all that great. She should have ordered something else. I do love Ticoz for the hip atmosphere and the peach salad. I look forward to trying other items on the menu just not the tamales.

There's really nothing I can say about LGO Pizzeria that hasn't been said. I'm just doing this review so I can add it to my Phoenix gems list. I've had LGO Pizzeria on my radar for a couple of years. Everyone would rave about how delicious the food is but I never checked it out because of the crazy parking situation. I was hungry after seeing a movie at the Esplanade and for some reason my intuition told me to go to LGO! I got there an hour before they closed and it wasn't busy at all.  I ordered the baked chicken wings for my boyfriend and a gladiator pizza for me. The waiter described the wings as smokey with a slight barbeque flavor. I'm not a fan of chicken wings but I could eat these wings all day. On to the pizza.....Probably the best pizza I've ever had. The crust, the sauce, and all the ingredients were top notch. I was in heaven.   I am so happy I finally made it to LGO Pizzeria. I understand what all the hype is about. There is something so special about this place I can't describe it. I want to move down the street so I can stop by everyday!

I have been wanting to eat here for a very long time but I am a baller on a budget and I usually don't splurge on expensive meals. My friend and I were starving and couldn't decide on where we should eat. I checked Azcentral and found out that Wildfish had an all night all summer long happy hour that starts at 4pm. Score! Walking in it was very dark inside and all the way in the back by the kitchen you can see all the glorious seafood on top of ice. The hostess explained that we could sit at the bar or at one of the lower level booths for the happy hour special. We ordered a couple of cocktails that were too sweet for my liking but the food was fresh and delicious. We ordered the crab claws, some cheese that tasted like buttery brie, and potstickers. I enjoyed everything we ordered and will be coming back very soon. FYI the all night all summer long happy hour special is also at Eddie V's and Roaring Fork.

I stopped by for dinner last night assuming I could eat a healthy dinner of fish and veggies but unfortunately all they have here is fish made with butter and sides that are not diet friendly. I settled on the Wildfish salad made with jonah crab, gulf shrimp, tomato, avocado, blue cheese and walnuts. $18 is steep for a salad but I enjoyed every bite. My friend ordered parmesan crusted sole. I took a bite and made a mental note to order it next time I dine at Wildfish. Service was fast and friendly. If you're looking for a nice seafood dinner I highly recommend Wildfish just make sure you're not counting calories!

The menu looks really good but the food doesn't deliver the only thing I liked about this place was the garlic fries but fries are really hard to mess up.

This is the best Thai place I have been to. The service is always great the portions are big and the prices are reasonable. I'm a vegetarian so everytime i come here I get a tofu dish with their egg rolls.  I can't put my finger on what it is but everytime I come here I get sick but I always go back for more thats how good their food is.

I've almost everything on the menu and you can't go wrong ordering anything here. I am a huge red chile lover and I swear Valle Luna has the best red chile in town! I just recently tried the green chile and that's fabulous too! Now my biggest dilemma is do I go with the red or green chile? First world problems.

This Qdoba is walking distance from where I live and I have avoided this place for a very long time because I love Chipotle and I had a feeling that Qdoba sucked. Qdoba does suck. Everything here is bland the rice, beans, and cheese are bland and the guacamole tasted like lemon paste. I will never eat here again.

The decor is sleek and modern and the food is pretty good too. The crowd is a little pretentious but very friendly. I always have a lot of fun here and it's my alternative to Scottsdale if I don't want to get all dressed up or if I want to do a Sunday Funday.

The Dubliner is not an authentic Irish Pub but it is one of my favorite bars to go to because the crowd is down to earth and drinks are CHEAP. Where else can you get a red bull vodka for $4? The crowd is a diverse mix of hipsters, hippies, skaters, and a few old weirdos here and there. If you went to high school in the area your bound to run into someone you haven't seen in years. I always have a great time when I go to the Dubliner because I meet such interesting people. You can find me here when I don't feel like dressing up for Scottsdale.

I've always been a fan of the food and drinks at Yard House but the service is always slow so I don't come here often. We ordered  a pepper jack burger and fish and chips. I was disappointed with my burger but lucky for me my sister offered some of her fish and chips they were so delicious it inspired me to write this review! I think fish and chips is an acquired taste. People who eat it don't like it they LOVE it. So if you're a fish and chips fan come to Yard House you won't be disappointed!

My first experience here was memorable to say the least...... My friend suggested we go to Dlish for breakfast because her friend gave her punch cards. Apparently the punch cards were worth nothing which is fine because I didn't go there expecting a free meal but the cashier made a huge scene and it was quite embarrassing. Despite the horrible service I really enjoyed my breakfast sandwich. I would definitely go back for the food and not the service!

I gave D'lish a second chance and the service was much better this time! The guys who work here are funny, friendly, and make you feel welcome. I like that they use all natural ingredients in everything they make here and I think that's why the food tastes so great.

My friend made reservations for her brother's birthday. We got there early so we could set up the table. When we got there it took forever for us to be seated and we were rushed. It took forever for our food and drinks and on top of that there was gratuity because of our big party. I wonder if the waitress didn't care about the service because she knew she would be tipped a certain amount regardless. Gallagher's is an average sports bar and without customer service I don't see why anyone would come back.

If you are a vegetarian and you love Greek food beware of Jay's Gyros their vegetarian selection is overpriced and tastes like trash. I understand the name of the place has Gyro's in it so I can't say that their meat selections are bad.  The hummus is tasteless and runny, the dolmas taste like pine sol, and the falafel is bland I just couldn't believe I paid $9 for a dinner I couldn't eat.  I will stick with Greek Patio and Pita Jungle for tasty Greek food."

I had a great experience buying a car from Arrowhead Lexus. They were honest about their prices and didn't pressure me into purchasing additional warranties or gap. My salesman was Dave and he was extremely patient with me and didn't make me feel rushed even though we were there after the dealership closed. I would recommend this dealership to anyone.

I read about this Muse in a local paper. I was very excited to check out this boutique. I was very disappointed in the clothes because I felt like I could go to the mall and find the same shirt/dress for half the price. I don't  know why you would open up a boutique if your not going to have a unique selection of clothes. I'm surprised this place is still open.

I was in desperate need for a haircut and stopped by this location on the way to work. Sarah did my hair and I've been getting compliments on my new style all day. I got a cut and style for $28! I love Arizona Hair Company because the stylists are experienced and the prices are reasonable. I won't get my hair done anywhere else.

Forever 21 carries the latest fashions at an affordable price most items are $30 or less. I bought a purse here and everyone says it looks like the new Jimmy Choo and I got it for $20! This location is 2 stories and has men's and women's clothing, shoes, handbags, and accessories. This store is so big its overwhelming. Its not organized so make sure you have all the time in the world to browse. You get what you pay for here. The clothes are up to date with the latest fashions but they will only last you a month or two. Most of the clothes they sell are dry clean or hand wash materials. Everytime I buy accessories here they break on me the same night so even though they are cheap I wouldn't recommend buying them.

I am sure everything Pierre has stated is true however I do know somebody who lives in these lofts and they are incredible! They remind me of something out of New York and although there may be a "parking situation" there are museums, restaurants, bars, chase field, and the stadium all within WALKING DISTANCE. Sometimes you have to take the good with the bad and when did walking ever hurt anyone? Are people who live in Arizona really that lazy?

I had a pleasant experience purchasing my vehicle from Camelback Toyota. I get all my services done here and the service advisors never try to rip me off. I also had to take my car into the body shop for some repair and it was taken care of very quickly. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a Toyota or Scion.

I like Zipps because they have daily food and drink specials, shuffleboard, flat screens tv's, and it's nice inside. I think Zipps has the same frozen margarita machine as Z Tejas because the margaritas taste the same and they will only let you have three. They're awesome make sure you try one next time you go. The only downside to this place is they have the worst bloody mary drink I have every had. The bloody mary mix smells like garbage and tastes like dirt. Its gross. I am obsessed with the nachos here and the rest of the food is pretty standard nothing amazing but good enough to satisfy your drunky munchies.

The other day I stopped by Fry's deli to get a sandwich for lunch. I decided to get a Boar's head panini. I went home to get ready for work and forgot it at home! I decided to heat it up for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. It was seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life! I highly suggest you try one next time you go to Fry's.

I think Sylvia's has the best Mexican food in town. If you love chimichangas you have to try the pollo rico it rivals the baja chimi at Macayo's. The chips and salsa here is great. I like how they offer you both corn and flour tortilla chips. Sylvia's is now a full service restaurant and the service sucks but I always come back for more because the food is so good. Just don't order the fish tacos!

My sister dragged me here tonight and our dining experience did not start off well. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes. Other tables were being served so we were wondering what the French was going on! Our waiter took our order he said he would comp our drinks and apologized. I appreciated the gesture and I was over being upset about waiting. I ordered the red chile with rice and beans and sour cream on the side. When I got my meal they forgot the tortillas and my sour cream. The waiter apologized again and said he wouldn't charge me extra for the sour cream. When I took the first bite of my meal I forgot about the bad service and remembered that I come to Sylvia's for the best Mexican food in town and not for the service. The food is worth the crappy service.

I was sick of fast food and I needed to eat something different for lunch today . A coworker mentioned Lemongrass and I had one of the best meals of my life. I ordered the pad thai and every bite was amazing. I didn't know that pad thai could taste that good. This is going to be my new lunch spot I can't wait to try everything off the menu! If you are in the area give Lemongrass Thai Cuisine a try.

I can't really think of any cons to staying here. The hotel is in the middle of the strip, its hip yet down to earth, the rooms are nice but affordable, and there are tons of shops and restaurants to check out. PH is on the top of my list of hotels to stay at in Las Vegas if you are looking to stay somewhere nice without breaking the bank.

I stopped by around 2pm it wasn't very busy and the girls that worked there were very friendly and extremely helpful. I ordered a dozen cupcakes and became the cupcake fairy for the day. It was my day off so I spent my day dropping off cupcakes to my friends and family who haven't tried them yet. They fell in love with the cupcakes and finally understood what all the fuss is about. My favorite is the strawberry cupcake the frosting tastes like strawberry and the cake is similar to banana bread. I tried the peanut butter one and I almost barfed. I enjoy peanut butter in moderation but this was an overload. Unless you are obsessed with peanut butter I wouldn't recommend it. Black and white and marshmallow were also pretty tasty. I don't even really like sweets but I can't help but devour these cupcakes even though I always get a tummy ache after eating them :)

I was invited to a Christmas party at Alexi's I  tagged along for the free booze but the food was amazing. For appetizers they served stuffed mushrooms, jumbo shrimp cocktail , and crackers with cheese. For dinner we were served chicken marsala, halibut topped with feta cheese and tomatoes, and tortellini alfredo.  Everything was fresh and delicious I was really impressed by the quality of food that was served I will definitely be back for more :)

I come here on Sundays for $1 drinks. The breakfast menu is okay but the portions are kind of small and not very filling. I started to order off the main menu and I am glad I did because the food here rocks. There is something for everybody here ranging from affordable sandwiches, panini's, and crepes to expensive entree's for those with more expensive taste.

The Place reminds me of one of those random diners you eat at while you're on a road trip. The restaurant is nothing fancy but the food is delicious. I ordered eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns with biscuits and gravy. If you are a crazy bacon lover you must come here to try their bacon it's the best! The Place is my new breakfast hot spot!

A promoter approached me by the lobby and told me that he could put me on the list  to drink for FREE till midnight. I loved that my girlfriends and I didn't have to wait in line and we got in for free! Turns out they only serve free vodka drinks but I was okay with that since vodka is my drink of choice. My girls and I had a great time and even got invited to drink for free in VIP! I really didn't pay attention to the crowd but it seemed like there was a good mix of people. Not ghetto or pretentious. I'll definitely keep LAX in mind next time I come back to Las Vegas.

I ate dinner here with a friend and her parents. Everything on the menu looked fantastic but I decided to be good and order trout with glazed carrots instead of pasta or fried fish with fries. My friend's mom ordered crab cakes before her meal and offered me a bite. I was impressed it was all crab and lightly breaded on the outside just the way I like em! I enjoyed my trout and tried my friend's halibut and her mom's Alaskan Sanddab. Both were equally delicious. We finished our meal with key lime pie and creme brulee. I am extremely picky about what seafood restaurants I will eat at and I give King's Fish House two thumbs up!

My friend Megan and I stopped by before she flew back to Boston. We started off by ordering a couple of agua frescas. Mango for me and Strawberry for Megan. I usually get watermelon but I was in the mood to switch things up. I was looking forward to a cold refreshing drink but what I got was warm liquid mango. No bueno. I wasn't in the mood to complain so I just asked for a glass of water when I ordered the USA torta. The USA torta has breaded chicken, ham, pineapple, melted cheese, and chipotle mayo. The sandwich was so delicious I don't think I can get myself to order anything else ever again. Megan enjoyed her jamon torta but I don't think it was as good as mine! I really like this restaurant but the food is so filling and bad for you I can only eat here every once in awhile.

I wanted tacos and decided on this place to satisfy my craving. I have tried the tortas but never anything else on the menu. I hate myself for waiting so long! We got a sandwich, tacos, and pork with beans and rice. Everything was fantastic. You really can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. Make sure to order an agua fresca. It's the drink of the gods!

I got my hair hacked at another salon and was in desperate need for hair repair. I was working late on a Saturday and Hair Pollution was the only salon I could find that stayed open after 6pm. I called to book an appointment and they booked me with Amber.   The hair salon isn't in the best neighborhood but I wasn't scared for my well being. The interior design inside is really funky and reminded me of something you would find in LA.   Amber listened to my story about the bad experience I had at another salon and assured me she could fix the damage. She started off by washing my hair and gave  me the best head massage ever! After that we discussed how I style my hair and what I'm looking for.  I am very happy with my new do and I'll be back to see Amber. She rocks!

I couldn't believe I had to wait for breakfast at 10 am on a Wednesday. I decided to stay and tough it out. I'm glad I did! I ended up ordering the wolfpack and I am embarrassed to say I ate the whole thing. It was huge and I was full the whole day. I couldn't even eat dinner! They put lots of yummy cheese on my eggs and the hash browns were crispy just the way I like them. My sister ordered the OE omelet and she said it was really good too. I was a fan of the food but I wasn't a fan of the wait. Also the seating arrangement here is too close for comfort they put a whole bunch of couples tables together and seat you next to strangers. Not my cup of tea.

I love Saddle Ranch for the fun atmosphere. I really like the food and the people who work here are so much fun! I I came here for brunch on the 4th of July and the waiter was pretty honest about being hungover and made us laugh the whole time we were there. He gave me the biggest mimosa I have ever had and gave me and my friends a free shot. The brunch specials are awesome their mimosas and bloody mary's are only $1.99 and you can choose different variations of the classic drinks. I always leave Saddle Ranch with a smile on my face.

I went through a phase where I bought all my clothes from Forever 21 because the prices were so cheap and I quickly figured out so is the quality. I love Express because the clothes are classic styles that are well made and can transition from work to going out. The prices are a little high but their sales are not to be missed you can find some killer deals. Express also gives out coupons that allows me to buy some items I normally wouldnt buy because I am a bargain shopper.

Fresh and Easy sells their own brand of produce,meats,condiments, desserts,dairy, and prepackaged food at an affordable price. They also sell a few brand name products that you would get at any other grocery store. Everytime I come here I load up a small basket and I never spend over $30. If I went to Fry's I would have spent $60 easily. The prices are great and they do not skimp on quality. I love that I can try new things without breaking the bank!

Pearl is a hip sushi spot that advertises an happy hour menu all day every day! I was skeptical about it at first but now I am hooked! They have $7 martini's, $4 bombers, and cheap novelty rolls. Drinks were awesome and the sushi was tasty. I think advertising an all day happy hour is genius.

I was walking down Mill with my mother when she saw the sign for Cookiez on Mill she turned into the cookie monster and said "Me want cookie". Neither of us have never been to Cookiez on Mill and were pleasantly surprised when we walked in this tiny cookie-ice cream shop. Right away we were offered samples of their delicious cookies and the best thing is that they will make you a homemade ice cream sandwich with any cookie and ice cream combo you can think of. The end result is the closest thing to heaven.

I was having a crazy sushi craving and unfortunately I no longer live in Scottsdale and going to Sushi Roku was out of the question. I pulled up sushi restaurants on Yelp and it was a showdown between Yen and Tokyo Lobby. Tokyo Lobby has weird hours so I just went to Yen.  I was blown away by the variety of rolls they have on the menu I wanted to order them all but I settled on a Philly roll and the heart attack. I was caught off guard when I saw that the salmon was placed on top of the sushi and not in the roll. I usually don't like my sushi that way but I ate it all it was delicious. The heart attack was really was like an Asian jalapeno popper I've never seen anything like this at any other sushi restaurants it was amazing. My sisters ordered bento boxes and they were very pleased with their meals before we were done eating we were already making plans to come back!   I feel so lucky I have found a great sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. I can't wait to come back!

I've had La Boccca Urban Pizzeria in the back of my mind for awhile and I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner! It wasn't busy on a Monday night even though bottles of wine were half price. I like it that way especially when I just want to relax and eat some good food. The atmosphere was hip and inviting. The menu was simple and was divided into apps, salads, sandwiches, and pizza. I ordered the  bruschetta and it was better than Postino's which isn't saying a lot because I don't think their bruschetta is all that. The wine was reasonably priced and I was happy as a clam with my bottle of Riesling. I didn't order anything else because I wasn't that hungry  but I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu everything looks delicious!

Walking into Jason's Deli I didn't know what to expect. Is it like Paradise Bakery? Is it like Wildflower Bread Co? The concept of serving sandwiches made from quality bread and fresh ingredients is the same but they serve classic favorites like blt's, meatball, reuben, and club sandwiches. If you want a "gourmet sandwich"  with fancy toppings you should probably go to Paradise or Wildflower. They also offer wraps, stuffed potatoes, po boys, soups, and a salad bar but it didn't look very good.  I ended up ordering ciabatta garden sandwich because It was  one of the few vegetarian options they had there. The sandwich was really flavorful and filling . My sister ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was huge! I don't eat meat but that sandwich looked really good. My sister also suggested we try out their cheesecake and it was delish!  I was surprised it was pretty authentic not one of those to go slices that tastes like Jello cheesecake.  We were very satisfied and will be coming back for more :)

Definitely better than Subway thinking of their meat makes me sick. Anyhoo I always get the Philly with chipotle mayo and it is deeelish!  Jersey Mike's is little expensive and that's why I don't come here a lot but you get what you pay for I can't think of another place where you can get a better sub.

I think Chompie's has the best breakfast in town. The omelets here are really good and cheesy just the way I like em and the potatoes on the side are oh so tasty. I also love how they have every condiment you need on the table already. The breakfast is great but they also serve sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, and Jewish cuisine like matzo ball soup and potato pancakes! I have tried a few things off the menu and I have never been disappointed.

I have been a salon whore for years. I would go to an expensive high end salon and leaved pissed off because I paid $60 for a haircut. Then I would go to Great Clips and leave pissed because they didn't do a good job. All I wanted was a good haircut at a reasonable price. I found that at Arizona Hair Company. They charge $15 for a haircut and and extra $15 to style. I feel weird walking out of a salon with wet hair so I always pay  extra for the style. The hair salon is down to earth and the hairstylists are experienced and friendly. I would recommend this salon to anyone.

Suite 301 is always my first pick when going out on Mill Ave. The drinks are cheap, the crowd is friendly, and I LOVE the rooftop patio. I always have a great time here and it's nice to know that if I work up the liquid courage to dance there is a decent dance floor to show off my sweet dance moves.

Last night was my best friends bday and in our world sushi + saki = FUN!  I always get the vegas roll(not on the menu) but the waiter suggested trying out the fried california roll and adding cream cheese I was also super hungry and decided to try out an appetizer. It was hard  choosing an appetizer everything looked so good! It was a showdown between fried tofu, tempura, and we finally decided on calamari. I was not happy with that decision bc last weekend I ate fishy rubbery calamari at some Irish pub at Tempe Marketplace. I blame myself for that poor decision lol.  The appetizer was sooo tasty and renewed my love for calamari again and the fried california roll was sooo dreamy! I look forward to coming back and trying out other tasty items on the menu.

I am not a fan of Kabuki. The sushi menu isn't creative and most of the specialty rolls are California rolls topped off with fish. When the waitress brought me my sushi noticed it was the wrong roll. I finally got the right roll and it was so hard to eat because it kept on falling apart. The waitress never apologized and that kind of bugged me because I waited a long time for my food. My friend ordered the Vegas roll and it was good. If my friends drag me here again I'll probably order that.

I ate dinner at the bar and had a great time. I ordered the stuffed shrimp, a caesar salad, and a half order of sea bass. The food was really good the only thing I didn't care for was the salad. The dressing was awesome but there wasn't enough for the whole salad. On top of that they serve the lettuce whole so you have to cut it yourself. I'd rather not work to eat my food. The shrimp had a kick to it but that's expected since it's stuffed with horseradish mashed potatoes. My sea bass was delicious and the half portion was perfect after eating an appetizer and salad. The bartender was very friendly and I was very happy with his service. It seemed like there were a lot of regulars sitting at the bar and they were very friendly. I've seen some pretty harsh reviews on here. I don't see how anybody can't enjoy a meal here. The food is that good.

I was excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews I was soooo ready to eat what many people said was one of the best meals ever. Before my food arrived I was given some bread to munch on and it looked really good I took one bite and remembered Patricks review of the dough tasting like tap water. Patrick was right.  The pizza dough tasted the same and I was crushed. Is there something wrong with me and Patrick? Why doesn't everyone else taste what we taste? I will be going back to try out the entrees and I will update my review

The decor inside made me think if Fez opened up an ice cream shop it would look like this. I'm not too big on sweets but I find myself craving their ice cream a lot. Sweet Republic also offers free wifi and board games so you can hang out and enjoy your ice cream. I just moved into the neighborhood and I can see myself becoming a regular here.

I have been here once and the food wasn't very good. We ordered the artichoke dip and and white spaghetti. The artichoke dip wasn't very good and I could have made better pasta at home. There was an Indian restaurant that opened up in the same plaza and closed down within a couple of months due to slow business. I live in the area and drive by this restaurant several times a day and it is NEVER busy and yet it is still open. Things that make you hmmm...........

This is my favorite Pita Jungle location. It's never too busy and the service is always good. Pita Jungle has the best hummus in town! I can come here to eat veggies and hummus and leave a happy camper. My only complaint is that the pita bread here is way too chewy. I think if you name your restaurant Pita Jungle you should have decent pita bread. Just my opinion.

My friend invited me to his company dinner and I was very excited to eat here. We were seated in the private room and had a couple of drinks and snacked on the complimentary bread before we placed our order. The bread was good and they served it with butter and an herb spread. We started out with calamari and oysters. The calamari was a little too rubbery for my liking and the sauce they served it with was just okay it tasted like sweet and sour. I don't eat oysters but my friend said they were fresh. For my main course I ordered halibut with shiitake mushrooms with creamed spinach. I wanted to order the chipotle macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes but I didn't want to get too carried away. Luckily the couple next to us ordered those sides and shared it with me. The macaroni was to die for and the potatoes were really good they topped it off with a parmesan peppercorn butter. The service was great and the food was excellent its worth the price even though I didn't have to pay!

Sonic Drive-In gives you the option to park and order and a carhop will bring you your food or you can use the drive thru. The menu here has lots of junk food options sonic has breakfast you can order all day, burgers, chicken sandwiches, corn dogs, grilled cheese sandwich, cheddar peppers, BLT'S,mozzarella sticks, and TOT'S! I love tot's and I always get them when I eat here. You also have hundreds of drink options available here you can customize your soda, slush, or milkshake. I know the service is slow but that's because everything is made to order. I used to work here and I still eat here because I know that all the food is fresh.

I could eat here everyday. In fact I do eat here everyday! Chipotle is similar to Subway but with burritos instead of sammiches. When you get there you start out with either a salad, bowl, taco, or burrito and you tell them what you want on it.  I really love their salads the dressing is soo good and their guacamole rocks. If you're on a diet this place isn't for you a burrito is about 1,000 calories!

I am not a picky eater but everything here is so bland and boring. The spinach dip was watery and tasted weird. My pasta needed tons of salt and pepper because it tasted like a Michelina's frozen dinner.  The prices are pretty cheap but you can go elsewhere for food that tastes much better for the same price.

I came here for happy hour and everything was amazing. The atmosphere her is sexy and the sushi is so fresh it melts in your mouth. The happy hour specials run from 5-7pm and is a steal for what you get. They have a few appetizers priced at $5 and some more expensive appetizers are half off. Drinks are cheap too just stay away from their specialty drinks they are too sweet. If you like Mikes hard lemonade you'll probably think they're great!

Even though the happy hour pisses me off I still have a soft spot for Sushi Roku. I have spent many special occasions here. The restaurant is beautiful and the food is sinful. I have yet to find better sushi anywhere else. I recommend trying the popcorn shrimp it will change your life!

I talked this place up to my friend and was extremely embarrassed I brought him here. We arrived late on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. The waitress told us there were no tables available and told us we had to sit at the sushi bar. There were several tables available so I have no idea why she made us sit there. I noticed that the menu changed and asked the sushi chef if they had a certain roll I used to order all the time and he said they've never had a roll like that before with an attitude. We place our order and the waiter forgot about a shrimp entree I ordered and didn't even apologize or offer to make up for it. I have always had amazing service here maybe it was an off night or maybe they changed management either way I'm not coming back.

The only reason why I'm not giving Hanny's five stars is because I wasn't a fan of the menu. It's very limited and I still have to drive to Scottsdale for delicious waffle fries. I ended up loving Hanny's more than AZ88 because the entire time I was there I felt like I was in New York and I've never even been there. I imagined this would be the place where the Sex And The City ladies would meet up to sip cosmos. Definitely stop by if you're looking for a classy place to grab a drink in downtown Phoenix.

How good can a cheese crisp be?! Come here and find out! All of the cheese crisps are delicious but my favorite one is the short rib and avacado. I've had a few of their tacos. None of them are mind blowing but they're good. I would reccommend the crispy shrimp taco and the fish taco. Margaritas are great. Everyone I bring to Blanco ends up loving it as much as I do. This is one of the few restaurants I will go to knowing I have to wait because it's that good!

I love shopping at Ulta because it's like shopping at two stores in one! One side is like the beauty department at Walgreen's and the other side is high end products that you would get at a department store. I can stay in this store for hours. Weekly sales and coupons keep me coming back more often than I should.

American Junkie is a great addiition to Scottsdale its laid back but hip at the same time. I can't really say much about this place except for watch out for the line it gets crazy and they have bottle service here which I think is a joke I would compare it to Maloney's having bottle service......ridiculous!

American Junkie advertised no cover and open bar from 8pm-10pm for NYE. There was a small line when we arrived but it wasn't moving. The door man said they were only checking in bottle service customers and they will let the general public in at 11pm. We asked about their open bar promotion and they said if we want to get in we have to pay $60. We were very unhappy with their customer service and happily went somewhere else that charged a cover but treated their customers with respect. Firehouse and The Lodge are better options if you are looking for a casual bar in Old Town Scottsdale.

I like the idea of gourmet pizza to go I think it's great because I love pizza. Walking into Red Brick Pizza I noticed they had tv's at almost every table and a few selection of beers so far so good. I already had a good impression of the place and was excited to place my order. I got a margherita pizza, a drink, a scoop on pistachio gelato, and an order of breadsticks for my friend. It didn't take long to get my pizza but they forgot the breadsticks and the guy making them asked if I wanted just oil on them? Uh no. Cheese please!  Who want's just oil on their breadsticks? Weird. I finished my gelato in the car on the way to work and it was pretty tasty but I don't think  you can mess up gelato. I was looking forward to having pizza for lunch but the pizza I got lacked flavor. Thank god I asked for a side of ranch because I needed that to eat the rest of  the pizza. I am not a picky eater by any means but  the pizza here sucks. A Totino's pizza would of tasted better then what I got from this place. The atmosphere is cool but the food is not.

I had my doubts about Cream Stereo Lounge beacause I didn't like the name of the place and I heard that they played a lot of house and techno music. I've been sick of all the Scottsdale staples like Myst, Axis, SIX, PCL, etc.... so I thought I would give Cream a try and I ended up liking the place a lot. Everyone there was very friendly and the DJ played a lot of good songs to dance to. If you're sick of going to the same bars in Old Town give Cream a try.

Blue Martini is a classy bar with a friendly crowd and lots of cougars. I was surprised it was pretty busy on a Wednesday. I got a free drink card at the door I thought that was pretty cool. I'll be back for more adventures here!

Blue Martini hosts "Take The Stage And Be The Lead Singer Of The Band" on Monday Nights. Usually there is a band that sings top 40 but on Monday nights anyone can go up there and sing. My friend loves karaoke and was dying to get up on stage and have her moment so I went for moral support. BTW she rocked! Most bars are dead on a Monday so I was surprised that there was a decent crowd here. No cougars in sight the whole night! The drinks specials aren't that great but you can get $7 specialty martini's or if you go with a group of people you can split a bottle of vodka for $100.

I came here on a Monday for comedy night and I loved it. The Turf isn't very authentic its more of a modern Irish pub. Everyone hanging out here was really friendly and the comedians were really funny.  We had a few drinks and shared the corned beef quesadilla. I had my doubts about the Irish/Mexican dish but it was actually pretty good. The servers were on point and never once corrected my cousin whenever he asked for a Carlsbad. I felt so at home here I can't wait to go back!

I ate here because they have all you can eat crab legs on Wednesday and Thursday. On a night like this I would expect a full house and line. The restaurant was busy but there was never a line. I like that I didn't have to fight the crowd to get some crab. They also had a salad bar, meat, fish, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, sweet and sour chicken, chow mein, tacos, hush puppies, and rolls. The crab legs and tri tip were great and the rest of the food was okay. We left completely satisfied and can't wait to go back.

This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.

I wanted to go somewhere I've never been before. Gallo Blanco or The Parlor? I read great things about both places but I decided on The Parlor. Walking in this place made me think of the Vig because the decor is very similar.  The food and drink menu looked great.  I was really hungry and started out with the bruschetta and a watermelon agua. The drink was light and refreshing, not too sweet, and you can tell that they use fresh watermelon juice instead of that pucker crap. The bruschetta mix had a sweet taste to it that I didn't like but nothing that salt and pepper couldn't fix. My sister ordered the grinder and I ordered the pepperoni pizza because our waiter suggested it. I took a bite out of my sisters sandwich and it was very plain but the french fries were awesome. My pepperoni pizza was greasy and burnt. I wasn't impressed. The Parlor didn't live up to its hype and everything here looks great but doesn't deliver.

I've ordered almost everything on the menu and everything is fresh and delicious. The prices are very reasonable I would pay way more to eat Mexican food this good. My favorite items on the menu are nachos with half chicken and half carne asada. The chicken is just as awesome as the carne asada so that's why I do half and half. I also love the fish tacos and tortilla soup. You really can't go wrong with anything here and if you have enough room dessert I recommend finishing off your meal with a raspado. You're welcome!

I brought my mom here for lunch and she LOVED it! I ordered tortilla soup and a fish taco and she ordered a barbacoa burrito with beans and rice on the side. My mom is a fantastic cook and was really impressed with the food here. I let her sample my soup and she said it was the best tortilla soup she's ever tasted. I sampled her barbacoa burrito and my eyes rolled in the back of my head! Way better than Chipotle! I am going to second Georgeann G this restaurant is always empty when I go in and I don't know why because the food is amazing. I might actually cry if this restaurant ever closes. So if you love good Mexican food try Sonora sometime you won't regret it!

Zipps is my favorite sports bar because it has an upscale atmosphere and great food & drink specials. Happy hour  is from 4pm-7pm and reverse happy hour is 8pm-close. On Saturday and Sunday you can take advantage of their hangover specials from 11am-4pm. See why I love this bar?  The food here is hit or miss. If you stick with the appetizers, wings, and burgers you'll be okay. I just tried the big zip burger with tartar sauce and it was amazing! I know tartar sauce on a burger sounds weird but it was really good and not as weird as it sounds.   The bar serves beer, wine, liquor. I highly recommend trying a margarita. They taste just like Z TEJAS and they only let you have 3. Skip the bloody marys they smell like garbage.  This is a good place to watch Sunday football. You can yell as loud as you want and people don't look at you like you're crazy. Sometimes I yell for the fun of it. Sunday's are busy make sure you get here early so you can get a good table.

I have never heard of Culver's before and I was dying to try their frozen custard. I got there 10 minutes before they closed. I felt kind of bad but the staff told me that if I got there a minute before they closed they would still serve me. I ordered the sourdough melt combo and a scoop of their frozen custard. The sandwich was alright, the french fries were flavorless, and the frozen custard wasn't anything special. I was really disappointed. It seems like a lot of people like this place and I don't know why don't believe the hype.

Management was unwilling to work with us while planning a birthday dinner. They said they do not take reservations and we could call ahead when we were on our way. We called ahead and the guy who answered the phone said that they are really busy and can't fit us in. Very disappointing.

My nephew wanted Sprinkles cupcakes for his birthday but I really wasn't up to driving all the way to Scottsdale so I looked up cupcakes on Yelp and found Sugar Daddy Cupcakes. Thanks to Stacey A I found it right away. The cupcakes were bigger and cuter than Sprinkles. I loved the glitter on top of the cupcakes. They were just as good as Sprinkles and the bakery is next door to my favorite place to shop. Does it get any better than shopping and cupcakes?

I got my car detailed here and I was in disbelief when I got my car back. There were little things here and there that were not cleaned. When I spoke to the manager about it he said that I could bring my car back and they'll work on it again. I brought my car back and the manager was very nice despite me ripping him a new one over the phone. I apologized and thanked him for allowing me to bring my car back. I'm still not completely satisfied. They tried to get spots out of the roof of my car and now there are water marks all over the roof. Next time I need my car detailed I am taking it to a dealership where they actually pay attention to detail.

I was driving in to get my car washed when I was hit by one of their employees. I kept calm, however, the manager was extremely rude and agressive. He asked me what happened and then told me that's not what his employee told him. This accident was caused by their employee and they had me exchange insurance information with the owner of the vehicle who was not at fault for the accident. The company did not take any responsibility for their actions. Additionally, nobody apologized for what happened. This is the worst experience I have ever had. I hope the insurance company bills the carwash for both of our damages!

I had my doubts about getting my hair done at a beauty school but after reading all the 5 star reviews I felt good about booking my appointment for highlights. I showed the hairstylist a picture of what I wanted and she started to work on my hair. The entire time I knew that what she was doing was completely different from what I wanted but I had confidence that the outcome would look great. When the stylist was washing the bleach out of my hair the instructor walked over and said "It's not that bad just throw some toner on it". While she was toning my hair she asked if it was okay to skip the blow dry since the school was about to close I told her no I want to see what it looks like dry. I looked in the mirror and freaked out because I had orange streaks in my hair. The instructor asked if I liked it and I told her no. She had no interest in fixing my hair till I started crying. I was leaving for Las Vegas the next morning and I couldn't go out in public looking the way I did. They threw enough toner on my hair to make it look the same way it did when I showed up. The instructor knew the girl messed up on my hair and they didn't even offer me the opportunity to go back so they could fix it. It was the worst experience I have ever had in a salon.

This is the best nail salon in my area. The salon is clean, service is great, and the prices are resonable. For some reason it's very hard to find a nail salon that hits all 3 requirements but this salon meets and exceeds my expectations. I had a great experience and will be coming back soon!

I haven't had the pleasure of staying here but I stop by to have a drink every time I'm in town. I prefer visiting the lounges rather than going to Marquee because their playlist is mostly techno and techno gives me a headache. This is easily one of the most beautiful hotels in Las Vegas. You gotta check it out!

I found Ashley on craigslist and at first I was skeptical about getting hair extensions from an ad on craigslist but after talking to her and checking out her website I was impressed by her experience and professionalism. I booked my consultation immediately. When I met Ashley she was excited and eager to answer all of my questions about the quality of the hair and the method she would be using to install my hair extensions. We decided on micro link method because it doesn't damage your hair. I have had the the bond method before and the hair felt heavy. The micro links are so lightweight you can't even feel them. Sometimes I forget I have hair extensions! I am very happy with hair and I get tons of compliments on my new look. If you want high quality extensions at an affordable price call Ashley and schedule an appointment. She's the best!

I stopped by with a friend for happy hour and ordered a spicy tuna roll, a Philly roll, edamame, and spring rolls. Our bill was only $15! The service was 5 stars. We sat at the bar and the sushi chef was always checking in on us and was such a sweetheart! I wasn't impressed with the sushi but my friend Danielle raved about it! For $3 a roll you really can't complain. The happy hour specials here are ridiculously cheap. I would eat here all the time if I lived in the area.

Stopped by last night and was not impressed. Right off the bat one of the girls working here told my friends that she wanted his balls in her mouth and she wasn't joking. I was disgusted by her behavior. After that  we met a guy on the patio who found a puppy in the bar and was trying to comfort the dog because it was scared of all the people and loud music. Later on that evening a bouncer told me that the dog belonged to the owner of Shotgun Betty's and was looking for the guy who was holding the puppy. I told him that the guy who had the puppy was concerned for its well being because he heard someone was making the dog lick drugs in the bathroom. I couldn't believe the owner would bring a puppy to the bar and leave it unattended. I do not feel comfortable supporting someone who treats animals that way so I won't be back.

I resisted coming here as long as I could. I couldn't imagine The Vig Uptown being better than The Vig on 40th St but it is. The inside is brighter and there is more space. The menu is slightly different but most of the menu items are the same. There are more drink specials at this location and they have fresh squeezed juice to mix with your favorite liquor. My favorites were watermelon and strawberry juice with vodka. The only downside for me is the patio is smaller and you can't smoke outdoors because technically it's still indoors. Just a heads up to all you fellow smokers.

I wouldn't eat at Calico Jack's but I had a lot of fun here on Friday night. I met some friends here because they won a vip happy hour. We enjoyed drink specials till 11 but even when we had to pay full price for drinks I think they were reasonably priced. This is my favorite bar at Westgate because its the only bar where you can dance and there were a lot of cute guys!

.My friend Megan flew in from Boston and invited all of her friends to Calico Jack's. When we got there they gave my boyfriend a hard time about his sneakers so we talked to the manager and he let us in. They were also charging a 5$ cover that night which I think is ridiculous. I would never pay money to get into a bar like Calico Jack's so we all left and gave Saddle Ranch our business. I really liked this bar when it first opened but over time the crowd has gone downhill and the doormen are out of control!

I checked out Sugar Factory when I stayed at Paris and I was blown away. The candy store is so beautiful and tempting! Even if you don't have a sweet tooth you should check it out. You can find ice cream, pastries, gelato, candy, and surprisingly cute apparel here. I stop by every time I'm in Las Vegas.   *There seems to be some confusion about this location. This is the Sugar Factory  in the Paris hotel. The address for Miracle Mile shops is 3663 Las Vegas Blvd. South.

The frozen yogurt here tastes artificial and its always packed with kids. The sample cups are inconveniently located in the back so you have to go against traffic to get them. Annoying. I only come here when I have a desperate craving for frozen yogurt because its the only yogurt shop in my neighborhood. I have been to all kinds of frozen yogurt shops and imo Yogurtland is the best.

I had a craving for frozen yogurt and fresh fruit. I was desperate to satisfy this craving convincing myself that maybe this time I'll have a change of heart and actually like the frozen yogurt at Yogurtini. I got tart froyo and topped it off with strawberries,mangos, and pineapple. The fruit tasted like it was frozen. My sister got island coconut and added some toppings to it and it tasted okay. It was over $10 for the both of us. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you like over paying for crappy frozen yogurt.

Firehouse seems to get worked into our Old Town rotation no matter what we are doing. Going out? Firehouse. Late night munchies? Firehouse. Brunch? Firehouse. Sports? Firehouse.   The food here is actually pretty good. The last time I was here some guy was eating a breakfast pizza that looked porn. It had white gravy, cheese, sausage, bacon, and was topped off with three over easy eggs. I'm definitely getting that next time. Everything I have tried here is pretty tasty for bar food and I swear they have the best waffle fries in town!  Drinks prices are always reasonable and every Sunday you can get bottomless mimosas for $5.   There is a diverse mix of people during the day but at night Firehouse transforms into a nightclub and attracts an under 30 crowd.   I will continue to come here for the come as you are atmosphere, reasonable prices, and friendly service.

I heard that Smashboxx is the new it bar in Scottsdale and I really wanted to see what all the buzz was about. There is nothing special about this club it looks like a sports bar with a dance floor. Smashboxx is the new place to see and be seen but I'd rather go somewhere that has a better atmosphere.

Canteen offers amazing food and drinks in a trendy setting. We stopped by for happy hour and enjoyed $3 margaritas, $2 well drinks, and pork tacos. The tacos are small but flavorful. They're usually $9 but since it was happy hour they were only $4.50. Our server was awesome he was friendly and had witty comebacks when my boyfriend joked with him. At the end of our meal there were some billing issues. The manager came out, introduced himself, and gave me his number. I was impressed with how he handled the situation. At night Canteen is a bar destination and gets really packed. Not really my thing but worth checking out if you're into the ASU bar scene.

To be honest I only came to this salon because my amigo Emilio works here. He is  experienced and genuinely cares about giving you the look  you want. If I don't like something or if I have a concern he takes care of it. I highly recommend seeing him for color. I got a color correction the other day and I walked out of the salon with my hair feeling healthier than the way it was when I walked in. The salon is really cool too. I love the open space and the view of cityscape is awesome. If you call to make an appointment ask for Emilio you won't regret it!

Tryst is an organic cafe located in the Desert Ridge area. Tryst serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and if you go in from 3pm-6pm they will take 50% off your bill. This is an amazing deal considering most of their entrees are a little pricey. I got the bring it on burger with fresh mozzarella, pesto, capicola, and tomato. The burger was good but I was a little jealous of my friend's steak dinner with potatoes and bacon wrapped green beans. Her entree was only $8! Everything on the menu looks delicious and I can't wait to come back and try their breakfast.  * You can purchase $30 gift certificate for $15 on localdines.com

I've heard nothing but good things about Tacos Atoyac and I convinced my father to join me on my taco adventure this evening. You can barely see the restaurant's sign at night so you really have to pay attention where you're going. I expected the restaurant to be small but I was really impressed with how clean it was in there. A restaurant can never be too clean! I scanned the menu and decided to try out a few tacos.   I ordered one fish taco, one carne asada taco, one al pastor taco, a side of rice and beans, and a fish taco for dad. I almost didn't order the al pastor taco but the big guy at the register told me he eats one al pastor burrito everyday. I didn't know If I was gonna like it so I just got the taco.   You gotta try the al pastor burrito. I say burrito because one taco just won't do it. After you eat one taco you'll want like ten more so just do yourself a favor and order the burrito with extra green sauce. I should have listened to the big guy.   The two fish tacos were served in one dish and even though I ordered one for me and one for my dad I never got the pleasure of trying that delicious taco treat because my dad ate them both! He knew one was for me but just devoured them one after another. I forgive him. If that happened to me I'd probably do the same thing.   The rice wasn't mind blowing but the beans were pretty tasty and all the salsas I tried were great.   Tacos Atoyac does not mess around when it comes to the taste and quality of their food. I can say with no hesitation that this is the BEST Mexican food I have ever had. Get your booty here and see what all the fuss is about!

El Hefe was surprisingly busy for a Sunday at 4pm. I didn't expect to walk into a raging party but it was fun. The crowd was pretentious but entertaining. Almost every time I used the bathroom a few girls would walk out of the handicap stall. I wonder what they were doing in there? Happy hour just started when I showed up so I decided to try drinks I've never had before. My favorite was the loaded beer its a corona with a shot of citrus Bacardi. I love the decor here its very girly. I'll be back!

El Hefe has become my go to bar in Scottsdale because the atmosphere is fun and the drinks are cheap. I came here for happy hour on Saturday and decided to try a carne asada taco. I wasn't expecting much because I have low expectations for bar food. Inside the taco was carne asada, white cheese, and pickled cabbage. It was delicious! I also tried a strawberry margarita made with fresh strawberries and that was delicious as well. I was really impressed with the food here and I can't wait to try other items on the menu!

Holy cow this bar is out of control. People come here to party like it's their last day on earth! I like to bring people here from out of town. They're always amused with the beergaritas and shocked that people like to party like it's 1999 on Sundays. I love El Hefe because they have a great happy hour but I can only handle this bar in small doses. I'm not a fan of not being able to walk without my drink spilling and getting bumped by random bitches with big purses.

I always thought that someone should open a bar with a pool and was extremely excited when I heard of Spanish Fly. I stopped by on a Saturday and it was packed. It's easily the most popular day drinking destination in Scottsdale. The bar was filled with beautiful people and yes there were douchebags. I don't know why people who come to bars like Spanish Fly and complain about the douche factor. You're at a pool party in Scottsdale. What do you expect? I came back on Sunday and had a great time. Sunday's aren't as busy but I like it that way. They do serve food here and everything looks great! I was impressed with the place and I look forward to spending my future Sunday Funday's here.

I met a friend here for dinner and we shared the mint shrimp, chicken dynamite, and basil fish. Everything was delicious and spicy. I was really surprised how spicy the food was considering it's an acquired taste. It made my eyes water! We finished off our meal with some green tea cheescake. I was in hog heaven and extremely satisfied with my meal till I saw the bill. Those martinis and glasses of wine really add up! I bought a $40 for $20 coupon on localdines.com and my bill was still $60 after using it. Next time I eat here I'll go for happy hour.

I found out about PVBC from a friend who posted the weekly special on Facebook. A double patty topped with jalapeno, bacon, bbq sauce, blueberry cream, and corn bread crumbles! I was intrigued by the unique combination of ingredients and had to have it ASAP! It did not disappoint! I also ordered a side of seasoned fries and a Lucky Charms shake. The fries were good nothing to brag about. The shake was amazeballs. I like that they're not stingy with condiments. They have a free for all supply of their house sauce in the soda pop refrigerator perfect for your fries or burger. I'll be back before I start my diet next week!

Last night we ordered a pizza, wings, a 12 inch sub, and three drinks for $24. They forgot to include fries with the sub. When we called they were very friendly and gave us store credit. I like Devil's Pizza Factory because their price and customer service can't be beat and they deliver till 5am!

I was hungry but too lazy to go anywhere to get food. My boyfriend mentioned that someone dropped of a menu from Geno's and they deliver till 4 am. The menu listed a variety of cheesesteaks, sandwiches, hot dogs, gyros, salads, wings, burgers, and loaded fries. I decided on a mushroom cheesesteak and Greek fries. When the delivery guy arrived with my food he told me he didn't have change for a $20. Your job is to deliver food and you don't have change? If you are a delivery guy and you know that someone is paying cash you should come prepared. Other than that the food was really good and I will definitely order from Geno's again.

I used to love Geno's because the food is good and they deliver but the employees seriously suck at life. The first time I placed an order for delivery the delivery driver had no change and offered to take my money, go to the store, and bring me back my change. The guy looked untrustworthy so I declined his offer. We have had food delivered to our apt several times and today a girl told me they don't deliver to my area. I asked her why they delivered to my apt a week ago and she said if I order $30 worth of food they'll deliver it . I don't know if they don't train their employees well or if they just hire stupid people but I have a feeling its a mixture of both. I called Silver Mine and had no problems. I wouldn't recommed eating here unless you enjoy dealing with idiots.

My puppy was bloated and I brought him here to see what was wrong with him. They ran some tests and never called me back with the results. The bloating went down the next day but I feel like if I am paying over $100 for tests the least you can do is call me back with the results.

My puppy was sick again and the only reason why I came back is because the hours of operation here work with my schedule. The people here really have no idea what they are doing. Based on my dog's symptoms I was able to go online and figure out what was wrong with him but I'm not a doctor and I needed a professional to diagnose him and give him the proper care he needed. They said they couldn't figure out what was wrong with him and gave him antibiotics. Turns out my puppy had kidney stones and was in a lot of pain. I took him to another doctor who was able to figure out what was wrong with him right away. If you care for your animal do not come here.

If you have the money to eat here DO IT! The food amazing and the atmosphere makes you feel like a million bucks (or 6) hehe.   We were seated by the pool for dinner and it was perfect. The service was great and our waiter explained items on the menu very well. Drinks were ordered to celebrate our anniversary. Chris(my bf) got a Coor's light and I got drink that tasted like a cucumber mojito and it was very strong. Our waiter dropped off a bread basket filled with sourdough rolls and onion focaccia. I promised myself I wouldn't fill up on bread but it was hard not to break that promise. For dinner we ordered a caesar salad, steak, and shared the lobster gnocchi. Best meal ever!  My only complaint is that they didn't do anything special even though I told the receptionist that we would be celebrating our anniversary. I loved every minute of my dinner here so it's really not a complaint I was just surprised they didn't at least offer dessert. It won't prevent me from coming back. I'm glad I chose Dominick's to celebrate our anniversary. I'll be back soon!

When you spend this much on food you expect a high level of food and service. The servers are always friendly and I always feel like I get what I pay for at Dominick's.

Reeta did my pedicure and did such a great job. The pedicure massage was the best I've had so far and she did an excellent job painting my nails. I refuse to see anyone else and will follow her wherever she goes if she ever leaves she's that good! I was still getting a pedicure after they closed. Apparently you also get a shoulder massage when you purchase the deluxe pedicure. I didn't want to make everyone stay late so I offered to skip the massage so they could go home. They insisted I stay and said that they are in no rush to go home. I was so impressed that they wanted me to have a good first experience at their salon. I've tried so many different salons and never left completely satisfied until I tried this one.

I would describe Raising Cane's as the chicken version of In-N-Out because they only sell one thing and that's chicken strips.  The restaurant is decorated with Movie memorabilia. It's kind of odd considering it has nothing to do with the food but I liked it. The employees genuinely seem happy to be there and are extremely helpful.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken finger sandwich with fries and a drink. The fries were great and I enjoyed my chicken sandwich. I don't know how to describe the taste of their house sauce but I like it a lot. I used it on my fries and my sandwich.   I had a good experience here. I think they need to jazz up the menu with more sauces and offer additional side items. I'll be back when I have a random craving for tasty chicken fingers!

I didn't appreciate the stupid wait to get in. It was a cold rainy night and 15 minutes seemed like an hour. I was about to leave when they called my name. I was pissed when I walked in and there were several empty tables. Why did I have to wait so long? When I sat down I was greeted by our bartender and he handed me the menu. I looked at the menu and it replaced my anger with excitement. The drinks here are so unique you can't order them anywhere else. I met some friends here and we all ordered something different. One drink  was on fire and another one had pearl in it. We were highly amused and excited to try each other's drinks. It's all about the experience here. I loved that I could conversate with my friends in a bar without yelling while enjoying the best cocktails in town. If you appreciate a good cocktail you have to come here at least once but make sure you bring lot's of moola drinks range from $11-$18.

If you would like great tasting Mexican food with a side of attitude come here! My friend asked for rice and the waiter pretty much rolled his eyes and said Barrio Queen isn't Mexican American. Margaritas are Mexican American and it's on your menu! Aside from that the menu is unique and I like the modern decor.

I tried a free class here and I was really interested in signing up but the down payment for a membership was $279! I told the manager that I was really interested in joining his gym but the start up fee was too much. He got an attitude and told my friend and I that we were looking at him like he had two heads and he is not going to waste anymore of our time. I was hoping he would work with me. I wasn't asking for a handout but $279 is way too much considering I can go to Gold's Gym and sign up for $20.  There are more affordable options out there I found Lee's ATA Martial Arts and it's $20 for unlimited classes the first month. http://www.leesatamember.com/

I wish my Phoenix cheesesteak packed more heat considering it was made with green chiles and jalapenos but it was still good and I'd order it again. I'm little disappointed the ranch they serve is store bought. Other than that the sandwich was really good. The bread was heavenly and the meat was superb! Fries were flavorful and crispy. I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

I sampled a White Russian cupcake at the Yelp Pleydate event and fell in love. Delicious cupcakes filled with booze? Yes please! They're actually really good and I would still love them even if they weren't filled with booze. I think these cupcakes would be a great addition to any adult party or event. I'm just waiting for an excuse to order some!

I was referred to this store when I stopped by the liquor store by The Vig to see if they had juice for my vape pen. There were a couple of people in the store already so I had to wait what seemed like a long time but that could have been my impatience from being hungover. Ben helped me pick a flavor and knew exactly what ingredients were in each product and educated me on what to get. The guys who work here are so cool they spend time with each customer and make sure they're taken care of instead of trying to get as many people in and out of the door as possible. Now I haven't been to any other shops so I don't know what competitors prices are like but based on customer service alone I would definitely come back.

I'm a huge fan of the company that created Postino, Windsor,  etc so I had no doubt that Joyride was going to be less than fabulous. Wrong! The restaurant is very cute and the drinks were great but that's about it. The food is overpriced and bland. We shared queso dip as an appetizer, and I had a fish taco with "bomb" black beans. The fish taco wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I expected more for the price. The black beans were boring as well. I would skip Joyride and head to Otro Cafe or Blanco Tacos at the Biltmore.

Naked BBQ sticks out like a sore thumb on this side of town full of chain restaurants. The decor inside is clean and modern. The food has a touch of sophistication that you would find in a restaurant located in Downtown Phoenix. I ordered a hot link sandwich with macaroni and beans. The bread looks gourmet and holds up well with the meat and sauce. I feel like my bbq sandwiches always fall apart but that was not the case here. The homemade pickles rocked my world! We were also given some brisket to try out which was very good as well. My sister said it was the best she's ever had! We are in desperate need of more restaurants like this in North Phoenix!

Located in Old Town Scottsdale The Saguaro is great option if you are looking for a hip place to stay without paying an arm and a leg.   Overall I was pleased with my room. The beds were comfortable, I loved that we could rock out to our own playlists with the IPOD radio, and there was a nice flat screen tv for our viewing pleasure. I'm picky about the products I use and was satisfied with the toiletries in the bathroom. There was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, a face bar, and lotion. All products were paraben free.   My only complaint is that the bathroom door is like a sliding door and it doesn't close all the way. Luckily everyone was kind enough to warn each other before going number 2!  This is a party hotel and people are going to party all hours of the night so if you are looking for a relaxing place to stay without the riff raff you should probably stay somewhere else.  If you're looking to stay and play in Old Town Scottsdale this is a good choice. You'll be too busy to sweat  the small stuff.

There was a great selection of bikinis and cover ups. I got an awesome cover up for $30. The owner was also very nice and helpful. I will definitely come back here for all my swimwear needs!

I love the layout of the new location, however, the food was disappointing. I ordered the LSK burger with a side of macaroni and cheese. My friend ordered some chicken and waffles sandwich. My burger was okay. Nothing I come back for. The macaroni tasted like tuna helper. The chicken sandwich was clearly made with an eggo waffle. I feel like the food in Scottsdale was way better than it is now. I don't know what changed. The location is kind of hidden so if you want people to come back you gotta be as good as all of the other options in the area. I would come back for the atmosphere and drinks but The Lodge will not be a top choice in the future.
