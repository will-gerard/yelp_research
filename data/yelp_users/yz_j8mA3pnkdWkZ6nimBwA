This place is a local spot and has been for a long time. The atmosphere is great and the fish n chips are the best. Service is always great. The fish n chips are not battered too much and the are fried to a golden brown color. pretty amazing with sauce tatar.

I like their coffee shop and go their frequently for breakfast downtown. Illy coffee is good and the breakfast sandwiches are awesome.

They have a very good happy hour. We like hanging out in the bar eating Happy hour appetizers and sipping away some stella's. Friendly bar staff.

This place is spectacular in every way. I previously gave them a 3 star review by mistake thinking it was a different restaurant. I apologize. They have some hard core good sushi over here fresh from japan. The chef is awesome and always works the line. He takes so much pride in his food and always wants to make sure you leave happy and have a stellar experience.  Sit at the bar if you are adventurous and want the chef to send dishes out to you. This is by far the best sushi experience in Arizona hands down.  I don't rate a place based on their staff or service but as a bonus their staff are friendly, very knowledgeable and so passionate about the menu and the items. The chef must do a great job making them taste everything. Give this place a try. You will thank me later.

Ask for Stan. Been going to get my hair cut here for ye past 2 years now. Stan is very consistent and he doesn't let you go until you are satisfied. This is a real classic New York style barber shop. I like the grumpy old guy that works there too. He add "flavor" to the shop

What can I say about JR that hasn't been said before. A fore note; if you don't know what a Michelin rated restaurant is then this place is not for you. Go to the buffets.  We started our evening off with a complimentary limo ride which picks you up anywhere in Vegas and was dropped off through the back entrance of the MGM mansions. A place I never knew existed. We waited for our gracious host to show up while taking pictures and posting on social media.  A 16 course menu for both of us. I enjoyed their gin and tonic which is out of this world.  Take the sommelier's suggestion on French wines. Wonderful service and food. Highly recommend

The tacos are very consistent and tasty at both locations. I usually get some tacos on the way home after work.

The parlor has good pizza and you know what you get is always consistant. Service is friendly and the patio has a nice feel to it. We like the specialty drinks in the bar area

This is a great spot for lunch. I would never order a blt sandwich anywhere since it just sounds too boring for me. My friend encourage me to try their blt and boy was it good. I will be back for more. Nice relaxing atmosphere. Friendly waitstaff. Bartender with tatoos should smile a little more :)

With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry. The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.

First of, ignore my 4 star rating and read my review if you want my opinion.  I don't like bash restaurants and leave low star rankings out of respect for business people trying hard.  Let me first start with the service. She was so friendly, quick and accommodating and was concerned that we didn't eat much of our food.   Look, we live nearby and we go top sushi places all the time and price is never an issue. We were even reluctant trying this place out as a happy hour sushi joint is not a good sign since good quality fish shouldn't be discounted.   We ordered a total of 9 dishes and kept ordering till we could find something we like. The boneless spare ribs was old, hard and awful.  The tuna martini has the lowest frozen quality Tuna. The rice on the sushi roll was old. I can go on but I will just leave it there.   I was hesitant writing this review but I wanted to do so just to ask everybody raving how good it is what they smoking or is it because they like happy hour over quality?

They are trying their best to give great friendly service and they do well doing it. I have to give them props for that. but thats where it stops. The food and the atmosphere is not my thing. I will hang out at Hooters at the AZ Center any day overt the Kilt. I wonder how long they will be around with the NBA season being cancelled. Wish them all the best as I support downtown business.

This place is typical what Arcadia dining is about these days. The atmosphere is great with the patio but the food and service is not good at all. At least they are busy and people like to be seen.

Barrio is known for overpriced food and drinks. I have used to go to the original Barrio location a lot and watch the prices rise big time over the years. $11 for a dessert. The Barrio Queen has the same concept. Overpriced f&b. Don't get me wrong, I know that the food quality is good, but there are a lot of better and comparable restaurants available that's a lot easier on the wallet.

Went here for the first time. Ordered a taco trio. The cook had gloves on and changed the trash. Then he didn't change the gloves and made my tacos in front of me with the dirty gloves he just changed the trash with.  The staff seems friendly and that they want to be there.  I cannot comment how the "trash tacos" tasted as I threw them away. What a waste of $7.59. I think the health department needs a visit here soon before people get sick.

If you don't like this place then you are insane or you have simply been in Phoenix too long. I am so glad that this place is in our area and it is exactly what Phoenix needs to take our restaurant scene in a different direction.  The menu is very eclectic and you can explore some great flavorful options. Salt and pepper shrimp and pig face dumplings are amazing.  Then try any of the bowls. The beef is my favorite.  The staff are super friendly and they are very passionate about the place.

Hahaha. Love this place. Everything about it. I laugh because they make fun of "pretentious Yelpers" you know the ones who are "foodies" overnight and try to bash establishments instead of giving them useful info. I love the food here as it is very creative. Cocktails are amazing. Phoenix needs fun bars with a great vibe like this. Well done B&T.

I can't believe I haven't left a review yet.  This place is LEGIT! Best Indian food in Arizona.  Usually Indian kitchens are not the cleanest and some concern what's going on "back there".  These guys have an open kitchen so you can see your food being prepared. The food is always fresh and so flavorful. Usually Indian food doesn't sit well with my stomach but this food I can all the time.  We eat marigolds on average at least once or twice a week for lunch. So sad we are moving away since we will miss Marigolds. Super friendly staff and a very organized restaurant operation they are running here.

Ocotillo is such a great place with awesome food and ambiance. Had the steak and eggs OMG. The best I have had especially for the price. Great consideration and energy goes into the food. The place is still new so they are still working out the service aspect, but they will get there. Can't wait to go back tomorrow for some delicious grub. The DJ Sean Watson who is a local big time DJ that played there on Sunday was amazing as always and compliments to the ambiance of the place. This place is a hit and will do great!
