How can you not love Old Spaghetti Factory? I don't care if it us a chain. It's cheap. It's good. And you can sit in a booth that looks like it's in a train car. It's great!   It had been a while since the boyfriend and I had been to the OSP and during our last visit I was reminded of how much I liked it. I ordered the pasta sampler so I got the pasta with the cheese and browned butter and a meat sauce. The cheese with browned butter is SO good. It's their signature item and it's awesome.  Of course all their meals come with bread, soup or salad, a drink and a scoop of ice cream or sherbet at the end. And I think my entr√©e was like $12.99. Total pasta score in my book.  We left happy, full and with intentions of returning soon.

Maybe I set my expectations too high for Coup De Tartes. I expected to love it, I only liked it.   The boyfriend and I went there on a Friday night. I was in the mood for some amazing food in a romantic setting. I got good food in a kinda cramped, but cute setting with weird lighting.  We were placed in a back room where there were 4 tables. It was pretty cramped and with everyone talking it got pretty loud. The lighting was from a ceiling lamp with weird bulbs. Not real bright but not really dim enough to be romantic. I dunno, it felt weird.  We started with the brie brulee. It was good, not amazing but good. I was glad to have plenty of bread though - some places only give you a few pieces. The cheese to toast point ratio was great!  For our entrees I ordered the lobster with risotto and boyfriend got the steak with potatoes. For mine, the best part was the risotto. It was cheesy and flavorful and a nice compliment to the lobster. The asparagus was also done well. Boyfriend liked his steak but it wasn't the best he's had.  We skipped dessert. They only had fruit tarts and we were hoping for something more in the chocolate family.  Overall I liked it, I can't say the food was bad but I don't know if I'd rush back. For an $80-$100 dinner I can think of places I'd like to go more.

I cannot say enough good things about Morton's. The boyfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Day there last weekend and we could not have had a better experience.  We saw on their website that they are running a special -$99 dinner for two. What an amazing deal. You get salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert! You cannot beat it.  We each started with a caesar salad, which was huge! It was very good - not too heavy on the dressing. But I didn't want to eat too much because I knew we had so much more coming. The deal comes with a half filet mignon for each person which is still a good size portion and your choice of seafood on the side. I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and boyfriend ordered the shrimp. Each came in an order of three so we shared. The steak was done just right, it was so tender and tasty. And the seafood was amazing. The shrimp was in this buttery sauce that I just loved. It was almost better than the steak.  For our sides we chose potatoes lyonaisse (sp?) and sauteed mushrooms. The potatoes were tasty and the mushrooms were a great compliment to the steak - a really nice combo. For dessert we each got a piece of their chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream - very rich and very good. The cake was moist and the ice cream helped cut the richness of the fudge.  I think some of the servings may have been smaller (like if you ordered the shrimp as an appetizer I think you get more than 3) but it was still more food than we could finish. We took a good portion of it all home and ate it as part of a meal the next day.  The service was excellent, and the atmosphere pleasant.  The only thing I didn't think was up to par was the bread. It's a big loaf of onion bread that was a little hard to cut and it just wasn't that great. Rolls would be better but hey, you don't want to fill up on bread anyway right? So not a big deal.  Morton's is perfect for a special occasion or if you just want to make an occasion special.

I have attended two performances at Ballet Arizona - Nutcracker and Giselle. Both were equally fantastic.  The dancers are very talented, the music is wonderful and the productions are top notch. The sets for Giselle were as pretty to look at as the dancers.  Symphony Hall is very nice as well. The chairs are comfortable and not too cramped like some other theaters.  I felt classier just being in the audience. Thanks for a wonderful evening, Ballet Arizona!

DEEEEEELISH!  Went to Postino with co-workers for lunch today. It's the perfect place for a Friday lunch, especially when the weather is nice. We sat inside but they had the "wall" open so it's was kinda indoor/outdoor which added to the nice atmosphere of the place.  They had $5 drinks so we all indulged (it was Friday after all). I had a mimosa that was made with freshly squeezed orange juice. Very tasty. For lunch I ordered a half prosciutto and brie sandwich and half mixed greens salad. Both were delicious. The sandwich came on ciabatta bread that was nice and fresh. It included several slices of prosciutto, a nice thick slice of brie, arugula and fig spread. At it was served toasted. The fig gave a nice sweet compliment to the salty prosciutto and the brie gave it a nice warm gooeyness. The salad was mixed greens with grapes, pear, and candied walnuts with a light vinaigrette dressing. I love fruity salads and this one did not disappoint. Everything was very fresh and the dressing was flavorful.  They also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on.  One minus - parking sucks. We did the valet, which is free but you know you gotta tip so it's not really free.

One word to describe this place? Cute. Another? Tasty.  The BFF and I visited Havana Cafe for the first time and hopefully not the last. We went for lunch on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. The place is pretty small (and cute!) but there are many tables inside and out. They had festive Cuban music playing which added to the atmosphere.  Since neither of us know much about Cuban food we decided to go with the tapas sampler. Perfect for two people, it was loaded with 6 of their tapas. I'll murder the names, but there were plantains, chorizo, a tamale, black bean fritters, cod fritters and one other meat item I can't remember the name of. We also got a side of Sun Chips (sweet potato fries) and a half pitcher of red sangria because that's how we ladies roll for Saturday lunch.  Everything in the sampler was delicious. My favorites were the plantains, the black bean fritters and the tamale but I really did like it all. The sweet potato fries were good but I've had better. That's the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. Nothing in the sampler was spicy so it's a good option for just about anyone, except vegetarians.  The sangria was good, more wine tasting than some sangrias. i'd like to try the white sangria next time.  The service was great. Everyone was friendly and they didn't try to speed us along or anything as we took our time chatting and munching.  They have a pretty extensive menu so I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few more things next time.

My first visit to Nosh was great! No waiting an hour for a table and the food was really good. A win-win on a Sunday morning. I ordered a bagel sandwich and a side of hashbrowns. The bagel was 1. Huge 2. Soft and chewy 3. Completely satisfying. The eggs were fluffy and the sausage was flavorful too making for an excellent bagel sandwich. The hashbrowns were also yummy. They were buttery without being greasy, salty and had just the right amount of crispiness. I tried a bite of my friend's pancake and that was good too - very fluffy.  The service was friendly and fast, too. The only downside was that it was a little loud inside. They did have a few tables outside but they were full. Next time if it's not too hot I would probably go outside for a little quiet. But either way, I'll be back!

Tried Los Taquitos for the first time the other night and really enjoyed it. Definitely fast food Mexican but it was tasty.   I tried the sopas, one chicken one beef, with rice and beans. I've never had sopas before so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were kinda like tostadas but they're not on a hard shell, it's a softer, thicker base if you will. Each one was loaded with meat, beans, lettuce and cheese. They were very filling. Between the two of them and the rice and beans I couldn't finish. The beans were fine, simple refried beans. the rice was just okay. Not bad but I've had better.   The boyfriend ordered soft shell tacos. They were tiny. We've seen this before, there must be a certain region of Mexico that does tiny tacos? I dunno, it's kinda weird. They're like taco sliders. But he said they were good. So order several if you're hungry.  We went on a weeknight and the place was very busy. A constant line at the counter. The best was the guy who came in and asked if the order his wife called in was ready. The girl at the counter said "what was it?" and the guy answers condescendingly "I don't know, give me a hint." Why would they know what your wife ordered dude? But they actually handled the guy well considering what a douchebag he was being.  I would go back to Los Taquitos but I don't know if it would be first on my list.

This place is legit. If you're looking for some awesome, authentic udon, you've found the right place.  My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner. I can only assume they do a lot of business at lunch because there was only 1 guy sitting in there when we arrived and only one other couple came in while we were there. How do they stay open? Anyway. They guy behind the counter handed us menus and we sat down. After a few minutes we hear "you ready to order?" we yell back "no." A few minutes later we were ready and the guy came over to take our order. I went for the tempura upon and my boyfriend ordered the beef udon. We also ordered a spam musubi to share.  The musubi came out first. It was disappointing. The spam was thin and overcooked. The whole thing was just kinda smooshed down. Not great. Luckily the udon made up for it. Mine came with a huge bowl of noodles, and an even huger bowl of tempura - several shrimps, eggplant, squash, potato, tomato -it was a ton of food. My boyfriend's was loaded with beef and again a large portion. Both came with 2 pieces of some kind of sushi I'm not familiar with, it was rice wrapped up in an eggy pastry-like shell and it was cold. Neither of us cared for that so we just enjoyed the udon. We stuffed ourselves silly with the noodles and tempura, and I loved it.  When we were done we just went up to the counter and paid. The guy was very nice, just don't expect a lot of table service.   It would be nice if they played some music though. When it's only you and one other table sitting in silence it can feel a little awkward. But otherwise this place is great. I'll definitely be back for more udon and I really want to try their tonkatsu!

I'm so bummed that First Watch has ruined The Good Egg. This used to be one of our go-to breakfast places but after our last visit I doubt we will ever go back.   While many items on the menu seem the same they have cheapened the quality of their ingredients. For example, Good Egg had really good bacon. Now the bacon is thin, cheap, blah bacon.  Another example: I ordered oatmeal that came with the muffin of the day. When I asked the server "what kind of muffin?" she said "I dunno, whatever they have back there." Okay... So the surprise muffin was a banana nut on the level of a gas station Otis Spunkmeyer garbage muffin. Blech. No thanks.  Also, they no longer do the loyalty cards. Lame.   Alas, it's time to find a new place for pancakes.

I was terrified to get a root canal after all the horror stories I had heard. But I was in terrible pain and needed help ASAP. I went in and saw Dr. Gillan. He and his team were so nice to me and reassured me that everything would be just fine. He was calm throughout the whole procedure which helped me calm down as well.  He was very thorough, starting out with a few tests (cold sensitivity, etc.) on my teeth and an x-ray to make sure a root canal was indeed needed. He numbed me up good and went to work. It was uncomfortable of course but it did not hurt. They did mine in two phases. First visit they cleaned everything out. Afterwards my jaw was sore but the tooth didn't hurt anymore which was such a huge relief. The place where he put in the Novocain was actually more sore than the tooth itself. I did take a few ibuprofen the first couple days after but I certainly did not feel the need for prescription pain meds.  A little over a week later I went back for round 2. This time he filled the roots. Again, it was not painful just a little uncomfortable. My jaw was sore again and the area was a little sensitive for about 2-3 days afterwards but now I'm totally pain free!  If you need to get a root canal, trust me, they aren't as bad as you think. And go to Dr. Gillan because he will do a great job.

I was jonesing for some plate lunch this weekend so I hopped on Yelp and saw Aloha Kitchen had good reviews. Yelpers, you did not let me down - this place is awesome!  Hidden away in a random strip mall is this gem of an eatery. It's an order at the counter and eat off styrofoam kinda joint. But the food far outshines any lack of ambiance.   I ordered the mini chicken teriyaki and the boyfriend went for the mini chicken katsu. The mini comes with half the meat, one scoop of rice and one scoop of potato mac salad. And there isn't much mini about it. This was more than enough food. The chicken was super tender and the sauce was plentiful and tasty. The potato mac salad was a surprise, but a good one. I'm used to just mac salad but the addition of the potato kinda kicked it up a notch. I ate every last potato and mac!  Boyfriend's katsu was fried to perfection and the sauce was served on the side. Bot of us left full and satisfied.   Next time I want to go back on a Saturday so I can try the pork. If it's anywhere near as good as the chicken I'll be a happy island girl.

When I saw pizza muffins mentioned in other yelpers reviews I had to check it out for myself.  The boyfriend and I headed to Floridino's for a late lunch on Sunday. It didn't take us long with the menu because we were there for one thing - pizza muffins of course! We ordered a half dozen and a caesar salad.  The food came very quickly but when the server put down the muffins I was surprised. While they looked great, they did not look like muffins. I was expecting a popover type thing. This was more of a pizza roll cut into slices. But like I said, they looked good so we dug in. Each slice is loaded with cheese, sausage and ham and it's served with marinara and ranch for dipping. They had a good flavor and were very filling.  The chicken caesar salad was good too. Lots of chicken and croutons, which I like. We got the small and it was plenty for two people.  In the end our bill came to $10!! (We didn't have drinks) Only $10 for real? Awesome! There aren't many places that aren't fast food where two people can get full for $10. What a killer deal.

I live in Tempe and the Farmhouse is hands down my favorite breakfast place in the valley.  The staff is always very nice, they even often remember my boyfriend and I from previous visits.  Their food is all (I think all) homemade including their gigantic cinnamon rolls that are out of this world, their biscuits that are so fluffy and good and their sausage patties that are done just right. The portions are very large so you will never leave here hungry. The atmosphere is laid back with a kind of quaintness about it. The only bad thing is the wait on the weekends, but if you plan ahead and get in line before you're totally starving it's SO worth the wait.

I had no idea this park existed until a few weeks ago but it is the cutest park in town.  Even though I'm not a 4-year old boy I really like trains. And even though I don't have a kid to bring with me, the boyfriend and I still had a great time.   Overall the park is set up for kids. It would be an amazing place to have a kid's birthday party. You can rent out one of the trains and have your party in there - how cool would that be? There are four min attractions that cost money - the regular (well, not full sized)  train, the carousel, the museum and the little steamer train. Nothing is more than $2/person but we bought a book of tickets that gets you into everything for $10. That's $10 for both of us!  First we went on the "big" train. It's a scaled down version of a regular steam engine train. It goes all around the park and is a fairly long ride. Super fun. Next we went into the museum. They have a room with some artifacts and then you get to go inside the cars of a train to see the kitchen, a dining room, a couple sleeping cars and a lounge. Then we hit the carousel - standard but still fun. Although I think we were the only adults riding it - ha! But we saved the best for last - the little steamers. It's a miniature train but it can carry passengers. (even adults!) Everything on the route is mini too and there are funny signs along the way.   The park itself is so pretty - lots of huge shade trees and nice grassy areas to play or relax on and it's very clean. I was very impressed at how nice it was.  So even if you don't have kids, this place is a fun and different way to spend an afternoon. It made for a perfect Sunday activity. All aboard, I say!

For the second year in a row the boyfriend and I have enjoyed a summer staycation at the Westin Kierland Resort. Even though it's only about 30 minutes from our house in Tempe the Westin Kierland makes us feel like we are away on vacation.  The resort is very large with lots of comfortable places to relax, dine or explore. The have two large pools, one is for families and includes a lazy river and the other is an adult only pool, which is what we opted for. The pool area is really pretty and kept very clean. There are a ton of chairs so you don't have to worry about getting out there early to get a seat. There are also a lot of umbrellas so you can find shade even on the sunniest of summer days. They also have a pool waiter walking around making sure you have plenty of ice water or you can order drinks and food. I love being waited on at the pool!  The rooms are pretty large with their heavenly bed. They are on par with the other Westin's I have stayed at.  Right next door is an outdoor shopping center that has a lot of really great places to eat as well so you'll never be at a loss for things to do or eat.  I would recommend the Westin Kierland to anyone from out of town or   to anyone in town who wants an easy weekend escape.

I've been to the Morton's in the Biltmore area several times and just loved it. Perfect every time. So when the boyfriend's mom wanted a steak dinner for Mother's Day of course our first choice was Morton's. Although we shouldn't have strayed from the Biltmore location.  I'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if "everything was okay." I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.  This location also feels much more casual than Biltmore's. I guess I'm old fashioned but when I go out for a steak dinner I get dressed up. Many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.  Next time we're craving a Morton's steak, we'll be heading back to the Biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service, every time.

Two words - Apple Pancake. The boyfriend and I visited JP Pancake a few weeks ago on the recommendation from a friend. We liked it so much we went back the next morning. On Saturday I got the regular pancakes and he got blueberry. Both were excellent but when we saw the apple pancake at the table next to us, jealousy set in. And the guy at the next table said it was really good. We decided to see if that guy was right and went back on Sunday. He was right. The apple pancake is awesome. It's an oven baked pancake, often called a dutch baby or as I like to say a pannekoeken. So it comes out of the oven all puffed up and then falls as it cools. It's kinda like eating an apple pie for breakfast. Delish. One of my new all-time breakfast favorites. I almost hate to tell people how good it is because the wait wasn't bad and if word gets out that means I have to wait longer. But I also want this best kept secret to stick around so here I am.  As for the woman who said the staff was rude, we found them to be snarky, fun and like an old friend. I guess we have sarcastic friends.

My boyfriend and I stayed here on a mini stay-cation and overall it was great. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a premier suite. It was on the end of the building, on the edge of the golf course so not only was it pretty, it was quiet.  The room was clean, bright and comfortable. And big. The two rooms and the bathroom were all spacious. The bed was super comfy and overall the atmosphere was very relaxing.   The pool area was very small but it was nice. The hot tub was great. It's quite large and overlooks the golf course. Again, very relaxing.  My only complaint is that our fireplace didn't work and when we mentioned it to the person working the desk we were told that there was no one there who could fix it. No apology or anything. So that was a bummer because we would have enjoyed that feature. And there was no wifi in our room. They said there was a network but even when we manually typed it in, we couldn't find it.  This place is a ways away from downtown Fountain Hills so if you want to be close to the action, this would not be the best choice. We drove about 15 minutes to get to dinner each night. But if you don't mind driving a bit for meals and want to get away from it all without going too far away, this is a great option.

For years I have passed by the Petersen House always curious about it but never stopping to take a look. It used to be open year-round for tours but now due to budget cuts it's only open at Christmas. (and occasional school groups I believe) So I decided this year I would finally get over there and check this place out. What a gem! And it was free!  The house looks pretty big from the outside but inside it's actually fairly small. You could say it's charming and quaint. The house was decorated for a Danish Christmas - the Petersen's were Danish - complete with two Christmas trees and many Nissa hidden around the house. There was a wonderful volunteer there who told us the story of the Nisse - a little elf-like character who would protect the house and farm. This women was a gifted storyteller. I swear I hung on every word of her story about the Nisse as if I was 5-years old. It was so enjoyable.   On the main floor is the living room, dining room and kitchen. Upstairs are a few bedrooms and a bathroom. The bathroom was closed to the public because it had been renovated by the last owners and did not fit the look of the rest of the house.  It was so fun to get a glimpse into what life was life for someone here in the early 1900s. Very different than today I'd say. I hope the city can continue to find enough funding and volunteers to keep the house open, even if its just at the holidays because it would be such a shame to lose this piece of Tempe's past.

To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's - nothing special.  The food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay.   A friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special - a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides - I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for $10. And guess what? It tastes like a $10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was $10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better.  All in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.

Let's face it, nobody likes going to the dentist. At least nobody i know. Over the years I've had many a crappy dentist so I was glad when a co-worker recommended Ahn & Perez and they actually turned out to be good!  Ahn & Perez are a married couple and their practice is very friendly. The office manager, Terri is always very nice and pleasant. Almost makes going to get your teeth drilled not so bad. They are willing to work with you on payments. When I had a crown put on they let me split up the payments so it didn't hurt my bank account quite as much.  I was really nervous for the crown work as I'd never had more than a filling in the past. The process was (relatively) painless and Dr. Perez worked quickly. They even have a TV in front of the chair so you can watch a movie with headphones on while they work on you. I kept my eyes shut but even being able to listen to the movie helped take my mind off my teeth.  I go back every 6 months for my cleaning and I never leave with my mouth in pain from being stabbed in the gums like I've experienced at other places.  I highly recommend Ahn & Perez if you're looking for a dentist in the Tempe area.

When it comes to nails, hair, skin, etc. I'm not a fancy girl. I'm a wash and go, cut my own nails kinda gal. I've had one manicure before and it was because I was in a wedding and the bride made me go. But after the dry summer heat has left my heels rougher than sandpaper I thought I'd see if getting a pedicure would bring my heels back to smoothville.  Since Magen is the only nail place on Yelp with high ratings I figured it would be a good place to go. I went on a Sunday and walked right in. There were only two other people there. I was quickly ushered to a chair with bubbling blue water for me to dip my toes into. Since it was my first time I didn't really know the moves, like when to switch from one foot to another but the guy guided me well enough.  He did a nice job. (I guess, I had no level of comparison) He scrubbed my dry heels, gave me a thorough salt scrub calf and foot massage, clipped my nails and lacquered them in pink. Since I was there I decided to get the matching mani to my pedi. The guy cut and filed my nails nicely but the polish application doesn't look that great. It's uneven near the cuticles. So i was kinda disappointed with the mani. My nails really don't look any better than when I do then myself. In fact, I think I could have done a better job.  I would consider going back for another pedicure but I think I'll stick to doing my own manicures in the future.

On a Friday night when you don't feel like going out but you don't feel like cooking either, get Red Devil take-out!  Red Devil offers your standard italian fare - pizza, pasta, calzones. Boyfriend and I settled on sausage pizza, BBQ wings and an order of fried zucchini and mushrooms for out Friday night take-out pig-out.   The pizza is good - lot of toppings and cheese. You can get ricotta cheese too for some extra yum. The wings were pretty good. We were hoping for more of a honey BBQ type wing but these are more like a spicy BBQ wing - good just not really what we were hoping for. And the fried zucchini and mushrooms were tasty, but really how could they not be?  We had leftover pizza and honestly it was even better the next day so make sure you get enough for leftovers!  The one downside was the price - it ain't cheap. For those three items our order was over $30. For an occasional take-out treat however, it's worth it.

When you're in the mood to clog your arteries, Ted's is the place. This is the kinda place you need to go to on the weekends so when you're done eating you can go home and take a nap.  I love the atmosphere at Ted's. It's an old school hot dog joint that hasn't been updated in years, luckily. There is almost always a long line but it's worth the wait. The boyfriend and I always get regular hot dogs and and order or fries and an order of onion rings to share.   Now their hot dogs are good, don't get me wrong, but they are char grilled so sometime I feel they get a little over done. Some people would say that kinda "burnt" quality is what makes it good but a few times my hot dog has been a little too charred. Their sides however are the best! They have skinny fries that are crisp and yummy and their onion rings aren't really rings it is more like onion strings. Sweet, salty, thin, greasy goodness. Get ranch or a side of cheese sauce for dipping - so good.  Ted's is one of those places you have to go to at least once, it's sort of a Tempe institution.

It's been a while since I've been to Rock Springs Caf√© and man, has it changed! And unfortunately, not for the better. The boyfriend and I used to love stopping by Rock Springs on our way to/from a weekend up north for breakfast or just a slice of pie. It was kinda dirty and the service wasn't always great but it was what you wanted from a "cowboy" kinda place. The food was solid and the atmosphere was old-school old west.   They've cleaned it up, added way too many tourist knick-nacks for sale and changed their pie recipes. Boo.   Once upon a time there was a woman named Penny who would make all the pies (or at least she shared her recipes).  These pies were incredible. They tasted homemade, her meringue was mile high and they were full of flavor. Now, it's obvious they changed recipes and cheapened the ingredients. The pie just had a "store-bought" quality to it. I ordered peach pie and it was obvious the peaches were canned and the flavor was "meh."  It was very disappointing.  It's become just another tourist trap with mediocre pie. Don't bother stopping. That was the last time we will.

If you haven't been to Lolo's in a while you'll be amazed at how it's changed. At least I was. And don't worry, the changes are good. The place is WAY bigger than it used to be. They even have valet parking now! But it's still as packed as ever and the food is as awesome as ever.  I met up with some friends on Sunday morning. We had to wait about 25 minutes but they have a nice seating area on their patio so it was fine.  After we were seated the first thing we ordered was Kool-Aid. Red. This is the sweetest Kool-Aid I've ever had. They must use twice the sugar. But it is so good and it goes so well with the chicken and waffles. I always get the Tre Tre's - 2 drumsticks and a waffle. They really do have the best fried chicken in town and when you get some of the maple syrup on the chicken, it's just the best thing ever.  My friends ordered a croquette to have as a side and it was disappointing. For $4 it was pretty small, and they only got one. It was not really worth it. Go for the mac and cheese instead!  For a good soul food breakfast, nothing in town beats this place.

I am shocked to see that this place does not have five stars. This place is amazing.  I went there for the first time on Friday night with some friends. We drive up and we see a ton of pink on kitsch inside so we get excited. We walk in and it smells like an old-fashioned ice cream shop. We get even more excited. Yes the decor is a little run down but to me that adds to the charm of the place. I like places that feel lived-in.  We sat down and opened the menu. Holy crap! 3 pages of different ice cream sundaes, bowls, and banana splits. Everything sounded SO good. The prices are a little high but the sundaes are big so you could share. Besides, you get what you pay for. Cheap ice cream tastes like cheap ice cream. This did not taste like cheap ice cream.  We had just had dinner so we kept it simple and just got scoops of ice cream, no sundae concoctions. I got the vanilla caramel cinnamon and it was outstanding. The ice cream is so thick and creamy and the different flavors really came through. Boyfriend had strawberry and loved it and one friend got the cheesecake and it had huge chunks of cheesecake in it. Yum!  Boyfriend and I liked it so much we got a small tub of vanilla to take home. Even their plain vanilla is tasty and after only two days it's almost all gone.   In a way it's a bummer we don't live closer to Mary Coyle's and in a way it's a good thing because I left there wanting more delicious creamy goodness.

Hit up Roberto's for lunch on our way out of town. We now have a favorite new place to stop on roadtrips - this place was great!  The owner was working the counter so when we told him we had never been there he took the time to explain the different items and what was popular. We decided to try out a variety so we got tacos - carnitas, beef and carne asada and one beef tamale.  The carnitas taco was SO good. It comes on a soft shell taco with pico de gallo and guacamole. The meat was flavorful, juicy and crispy in parts. I would say it was the best carnitas I've found in the valley. The beef taco was also good but after the carnitas it did kinda pale in comparison.   The tamale was also good - not too spicy but still flavorful.  Next time we head up north we will definitely be making a taco stop at Roberto's!

If there is one thing lacking in the Valley it's good independent donut shops. Luckily I don't live too far from Bosa Donuts in Chandler. But these donuts are worth the drive, wherever you might be coming from.  Bosa is open 24-7 which makes it perfect for late night donut cravings or lazy Sunday mornings. They have a decent variety. A mix of raised, cake, and filled. My favorites are the glazed twist (so good!) and their old fashioned donuts. The cream filled are also tasty and the boyfriend loves the jelly filled.   This place is cheap too. Got 6 donuts the other day for $4. Can't beat it. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about and at times can feel a little creepy so we always just get our donuts to go.  In my opinion this isn't just the best donut shop in Chandler, it's the best in the Valley.

I recently found myself at Los Olivos for dinner and was reminded of just how great this place really is.   I have been there many times and almost always order the same thing - the mini combo. It's a mini taco, mini enchilada, mini tamale and a mini tostada served with rice and beans. A plate full of mini food! Yea! Awesome every time.   On my last visit I decided to keep it simple and just get two tacos. Full sized. I got one chicken and one beef. I had never had the chicken and was pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite and discovered it was fried chicken! In a taco! Score.  Whether you like chicken or beef (or I think they might have shrimp) the tacos at Los Olivos are the best tacos in town, hands down.  And to top it off they have really good chips and salsa, which to me can make or break a place.  The other great thing about this place is the first room as you walk into the seating area. It looks like what a mexican hobbit hut might look like. Totally cool.

Maybe I went on an off day but I was not impressed with this pizza.  But before I get into that, I was also not impressed with the service. Our waiter was just kinda weird. And not in a good way. Every time he came to our table he would stand there and wait for us to speak first which I found rather strange and off putting. He was the employee, shouldn't he have led the conversation? He literally stood by our table until I said "well, I think we're ready to order." Weird. Whatever.  The boyfriend and I ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. I was excited because I usually love hand-tossed brick oven pizza and I had read so many great reviews. Our pizza was lukewarm and the crust in the middle of the pizza was soggy. It was fine on the outer edges but what a way to start a slice - with a mouthful of soggy pizza goo. I thought it was pretty expensive as well.  So now all I think of when I think of Grimaldi's is a soggy pizza. Yuck. I don't think I'll be rushing back for more.

This is one of those places that you'll pass by a million times, never really giving it a second look. At least that's what I did. Who knew it would turn out to be a great secret, hiding right in front of my face.  Boyfriend and I were in the old town area and decided we wanted Italian for dinner. Saw the good reviews on Yelp and make a beeline for the place. Thank you fellow Yelpers for steering us in the right direction yet again.  The place was busy but we managed to get a table. It's a little crammed but it kinda adds to the experience IMO. The waiter was very attentive but not pushy, which I like. I ordered the white lasagna and boyfriend went with the cheese ravioli. We both chose the soup to start.  The soup was delicious. I knew that if the meal was as good as the soup, this would be a great dinner. The portion was huge and the soup was loaded with yummy veggies and was very flavorful. The bread that came with it was yummy, crusty french bread - perfect for dipping in soups and sauces.  My white lasagna was really good and REALLY rich. If you're on a diet, do not bother ordering this dish. The white lasagna is layered with ricotta cheese, mushrooms and spinach and then drowned in alfredo sauce. No, I'm not kidding. It came in a bowl.  It was kinda like lasagna alfredo soup. And it was awesome!!  Boyfriend loved his cheese ravioli too. Also a large portion, covered in sauce. He came pretty close to licking the plate.  If you want a no frills, casual, basic but amazing Italian dinner, I highly recommend Italian Grotto. I look forward to eating there again.

The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.  Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the "town" and taking goofy pictures of each other.  Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.  We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic.   We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!

A hidden gem in south Scottsdale, Lo Cascio serves up some of the yummiest Italian food around. Their bread is always fresh and their sauces are delicious. They have some of the best fettucini alfredo I've ever had. And the portions are very large, I always have leftovers.  Their caesar salad is really good but they can go a little heavy on the dressing in my opinion. If you like it light, let them know.  Lo Cascio also has really good dessert, some they do seasonally.  And you can't beat Mama Cascio wearing her big Martin Scorcese glasses. Love her!  Get ready for some heavy duty and delicious Italian food if you go here.

Maybe it's the midwestern in me, or maybe I'm just not very adventurous, because when it comes to middle eastern food, it don't have a clue as to what's what. But I've been to Haji Baba a couple times now and have not only found things on the menu I can identify, I found things that are really good!  1. their hummus is really good and their pitas are nice and fresh. 2. the chicken shwarma is also really good, flavorful without being weird. 3. I've never been a big falafel fan, at most places it seems really dry to me, but theirs is not dry, yet not greasy, has a good flavor and is complimented nicely with the tahini sauce.  On my last visit I ordered the falafel (three balls) and a side of rice. They gave me a huge plate of rice, more than I could eat. Between that and the falafel I was full and satisfied.   And like everyone else says, it's cheap, which is always a bonus.

Spinato's is the best pizza in Tempe - no question. I've been stuffing my face with their yummy pizza for a few years now and I'm never disappointed.  Spinato's is a no frills, awesome food kinda place. You don't go here for the atmosphere, you go to fill your belly.  Here are a few of my fav menu items:  Normally I don't really care for cooked spinach but their signature spinach pizza is fantastic. It's loaded with spinach and garlic so not the best choice if you're on a date. I recommend adding sausage to it as well to kick it up a level. So good.  Speaking of spinach, last time I was there my friends and I got the spinach with extra sauce. I was hesitant because, like the cooked spinach, I don't like a ton of sauce on my pizza (apparently I'm picky). But just like the cooked spinach, Spinato's made extra pizza sauce extra awesome. They drizzle it on top of the cheese instead of just adding to the sauce underneath  to give the pizza an extra ounce of sweetness.   And then there is the best thing on the menu - the spaghetti calzone. It's  a full spaghetti dinner wrapped into a bundle of dough. Get it with the meatballs and the ricotta cheese. I mean if you're gonna order a spaghetti calzone, you gotta go all in right? Right.   The staff here is always really friendly. It's rare to get the same server more than once at places around here but at Spinato's their staff is consistent. And they remember us when we go in. It's nice to be acknowledged for being a regular. Kinda makes me think it might be time to visit them again...

I used to love Caffe Boa. I work nearby and when someone would suggest Boa for lunch I would jump at the chance. I haven't been there in a while and today I think I figured out why no one suggests to go there anymore - it's not as good!  We (party of 3) arrived at about 12:15, the place was not very busy so we got a nice spot outside. Looking at the menu we immediately noticed it had changed. They used to have several great salad options, now they only have three. It looked like they have less pasta too. I ordered a half salad and half sandwich. The other two girls ordered salads. We didn't get our food until 1:00 pm! It's not like we took a long time to order. Good thing we weren't in a hurry.   They came by and gave us bread and dip, which was good, but they only gave us one piece of bread each and never came back to offer more. Not that I want to pig out but I thought one piece of bread was a little stingy.    When it finally came, my turkey sandwich was kinda blah. Even the red pepper mayo on it didn't add much life to it. I think there was cheese on it but I couldn't really tell. My salad was just okay - mixed greens with candied pecans, bleu cheese and pears, well, two tiny slivers of pear.   Overall, I was very underwhelmed and after we got back to work my co-worker expressed the same displeasure. I want my old Caffe Boa back!

Thai Basil has become a lunchtime staple for me and my coworkers. It's not my favorite thai place in town but for a quick, filling lunch for under $10 this place is great.  I usually rotate through my three favorites - the pad thai, the thai basil and the thai basil seafood. Every entree is served with a bowl of soup, a generous portion of rice and a small but tasty eggroll. it's not uncommon to have leftovers or to head back to work stuffed.  The place is small and tends to fill up at lunchtime but we've never had to wait real long if we have to wait at all. The service is quick, we can get in and out in under an hour.

Note to self: If the staff behind the counter is fighting loudly with each other, just leave.   The boyfriend and I needed a quick breakfast this AM so we decided to head over to P. Croissant. We've been before and while the croissants are overpriced, they're decent so we figured it would be a good option. We were wrong.  We walked in and it was relatively busy. There was a short line so we found our place in the queue and were quickly greeted with the sounds of two staffers fighting loudly with each other. Good Morning to you too! They were both obviously stressed out and were blaming each other for their own freak out but it made us feel very uneasy. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and I don't even think I got a thank you.  We then proceeded outside to find a table to sit at but almost every chair (and table) had bird poop all over it. The one chair that didn't had something (orange juice I hope) spilled on it. And I'm not talking about a little spec of bird crap. There was enough to really gross me out. So, back inside.  We finally get our sandwiches. They were okay. The bacon was pretty rubbery - probably because they microwave everything. But honestly even if the sandwich had been amazing, the atmosphere created by the staff was so off-putting I lost my appetite.   I know working in food is not easy but fighting in front of customers again and again is just not acceptable.

As a midwestern transplant I have come to appreciate the greatness of having a good taco shop in the neighborhood. I live close to Someburros so it is my go-to place when I need a taco quick.  I've been going to Someburros for quite a while and never had anything that I didn't like. Their tacos are solid, tostadas are good, rice and beans are good - really everything on the menu is worth eating.  But this past weekend I tried a menu item I had not tried before - the beef and potato taco. It's midwest meets southwest and my Minnesota tastebuds were jumping for joy with the first bite. I know it sounds weird to have potatoes in a taco but seriously this thing is awesome. Ground beef with a little bit of taco seasoning, bits of potato, cheese and lettuce stuffed into a hard shell taco - yum!!  This discovery may be dangerous considering the proximity to my house.

The boyfriend and I were in the mood for some non-greasy Mexican food so we ventured up to Los Sombreros last Friday. We have been there several times but we always order the same thing. I get the pollo con espinacas and he gets the pollo enchiladas.   It was a nice evening so we chose to sit in the outdoor patio area - great atmosphere with twinkling lights, little fire pits going and a guy playing guitar and singing in Spanish. They were very busy that night so the food did take a little while to get, but other than that the service was good. And besides, you have the chips and salsa to snack on while they prepare your food.  Los Sombreros is not your typical taco shop. Don't walk in expecting to find greasy tacos and humongous burritos. It's more what I would call "foofy" (technical term) Mexican food.  My pollo con espinacas is two generous portions of chicken served in a chipotle cream sauce with spinach. On the side you can get rice, beans or veggies so I got rice and veggies. This dish is SO good. The chipotle cream sauce is just the right combination of spicy and creamy - make a great dip for the chips too! And the portion is big enough I always take half home.  I didn't get a margarita but this place has a HUGE list of tequilas so if you're looking for something other than Cuervo this place can satisfy.  I've always been happy with my dining experience at Los Sombreros. It's a great date place with great food.

(This is for the restaurant, not the bakery.)  Seriously one of the best breakfasts I have ever eaten. SO good!  My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday morning. There was a wait so we decided to just sit in the bar area. We sat at a high top for at least 10 minutes and no one came to our table. So the bartender invited us to sit at the bar and offered to take care of us, which she did!  We started with an order of the beignets. We wanted the special raspberry ones but they were sold out so we went for the standard spiced. They were good but not the best I've had, which was surprising. I expected them to be better. But the rest of the food made up for them!  I had the French toast - which had a seasonal pumpkin flavor with fresh cranberries. This is definitely French-style French toast. It's more like bread pudding than bread so it's very dense. It was melt in your mouth delicious.   My boyfriend had the croque madame which came with French fries. It was delicious as well. The bread was fresh, the egg cooked perfectly and the ham was flavorful. The fries were thin, crispy and yummy. We ate every bite of both breakfasts.  So even though we had a little bit of a rough start, in the end we left very satisfied. I would highly recommend Bouchon!

Even though this is the original location I used to go to the Chandler location when that was open. Since that is no more, I hadn't been to Chino in ages. Luckily, upon this visit I discovered it was just as good as I remembered it.   I got the jade red chicken with white rice and black beans. The chicken is so good but really spicy. I'm sure some people wouldn't think it's too spicy but I'm a wimp when it comes to the heat so I could go down a notch. But that being said - I still ate it! The combo of the chicken with the rice and beans somehow just works so well.   And I love that you get a cookie with your meal too. A nice little bonus for sure.   Like others have said - this place is a dive, but the food is worth the visit. And if you need a better atmosphere, take it to go. It's called Chino Bandito Takee-Outee for a reason.

So my friend had a conference here and asked me to join her for some weekend fun. When I heard it was located off the strip I'll admit I wasn't too excited. But when I showed up I was pleasantly surprised - this place is actually really nice!  First of all, they do offer a free airport shuttle but only at specific times of the day so if you don't time it right you may be out of luck. Luckily my plane landed at just the right time to catch a ride. The shuttle was like a little bus so it was comfy and the ride wasn't too long.  Like most places in Vegas, this place is huge. It's got a big casino, tons of rooms and a really big pool area. The room was really nice, clean and quiet. The bathroom was gigantic. And the bed was really comfy.  The pool area was nice - lots of chairs and umbrellas. But the best part was a little ways off the pool they have these big bed-type structures that are awesome! I want one of these for my own backyard. I could hang out there all day.  The only real bummer was that their strip shuttle only runs until 8:30pm. Who comes back from the strip at 8:30?? The cab ride back cost over $40 - so plan accordingly if you don't have a car!

The boyfriend and I hit The Greene House on a Friday night and it was a great place for a casual, but not too casual,  Friday date.  Even though it was Friday we were able to get seated right away. We decided to get a few things to share, that way we could try a couple different items on the menu.   We started with the mac and cheese with sausage. It's kind of like an adult version of macaroni and cheese with a hot dog. The mac and cheese is tasty - very thick cheese. The sausage is a link served on the side, cut in half which was perfect since we were sharing. The sausage had a little kick to it but was not super spicy. A nice compliment to the cheese.  Next we had the twin Kobe burgers with fries. They put it on two plates so I think we got extra fries which was cool. The burger was delicious. So tender and juicy and had that good burger flavor. They are small like a slider so if we hadn't been getting multiple dishes I could have easily eaten both. The fries were good too, thin and crispy with lighten herbs on them.  For desert we had to try the donut. We are both big donut lovers and this one didn't disappoint. It's an oversized sugar donut served with a large donut hole. Definitely big enough to share. On the side is a vanilla and raspberry cream sauce for dipping. It's kind of like a reverse jelly donut. The donut came out warm and soft and was delicious when dipped in the sauce.  A great choice for dessert when you want something a little out of the ordinary but nothing too weird.  My only complaint about Greene House was the noise. It was very loud in there so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The place isn't that big so we were surprised at the noise level. If it hadn't been so hot out we would have sat outside. Oh well, next time.  I would love to go back and try some of their other dishes.

I had been to Fez for drinks (which are good) but had never been there for food before last night. I've heard for a while now how amazing their burgers are. I have to admit they lived up to the hype. I had the all American burger and it was one of the best burgers in town. It was cooked just right with lots of cheese and a  yummy garlic aoli sauce. And it was huge!  It was a half pound burger cut in half so basically two burgers. Easily big enough to share.   My only dissapointment was with the fries. There were 5 of us and we ordered 2 baskets of fries. The sweet potato fries and the rosemary and garlic. They were both good ( good portions too) but they didn't blow me away.   The burger more than made up for the fries and I look forward to eating there again.

For some reason I had a totally different idea of Carly's than what it actually is. I thought it would suck. Maybe there was a different restaurant in there before, maybe I just made it up in my head. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised with my dinner there last night.  The boyfriend's band was playing at Revolver Records across the street so we decided to hit Carly's before the show. The place was packed but we managed to snag a two-top anyway. We sat for a little while before someone came over wit menus but like I said they were busy so I overlooked it.  We decided to start with the artichoke dip for an appetizer. It was really tasty but it was more like an artichoke hummus than most of the artichoke dips I've had before. The bread it was served with was fresh and warm - so good we asked for more.  For dinner I ordered the pear sandwich which is pear, prosciutto and brie on a panini. I ordered it with the orzo salad. We waited a pretty long time to get our food, thank god we had the app to tide us over. My sandwich was very good. I could have used a few more slices of prosciutto but overall it had a very good flavor. But speaking of "could have used a little more" the orzo salad was like a sample. One tiny little scoop of orzo. It was good, I would have enjoyed more. The boyfriend got chips with his sandwich and he got a ton of them. So my advice if you're hungry - order the chips!  The atmosphere was nice - a little hipster but not real uppity. I love that downtown Phoenix is starting to get a good variety of restaurants so I would happily go back and support the local flavor.

I love BBQ and I've wanted to try Bobby Q for a while so when the boyfriend had a friend coming to visit who was staying near here I suggested we try it out.  It's always a little scary to take someone to a place you've never been to but Bobby Q did not disappoint.  We started with their Q rolls for an appetizer. SO good. They are kinda like egg rolls but with brisket and they come with a chipotle dipping sauce that is really good.   I ordered the brisket sandwich (apparently I was in a brisket kinda mood) which comes with shoestring fries and I ordered a side of mac n cheese as well. I'm not kidding when I say this is some of the best beef brisket I've ever had. It was so tender, not dry at all and it had just the right amount of sauce - enough to give you that rich BBQ flavor but not so much that the meat is swimming in it. The fries were good but the mac n cheese was really good. VERY rich and creamy. I couldn't finish it all.  The boyfriend had chicken and mashed potatoes. He said the chicken was good but the potatoes came without gravy. Maybe they forgot it? So those were kinda dull.  Our friend got ribs and mac n cheese. The ribs looked amazing - fall off the bone type.  We stayed at the table really late - we were literally the last people in the place but they didn't seem to care that we were just hanging out which was cool.   We didn't go to the bar next door but it was packed and looked like a fun place to grab a drink.  Bobby Q turned out to be a great place to bring a visitor since they let us talk forever and the food was tasty and reasonably priced. I would definitely eat there again.

I could have sworn a wrote a review for La Grande Orange considering how long I've been going here but I guess not. So now it's time to throw in my five stars for one of my favorite places in P-town.  La Grande Orange is know for their pizza and for good reason - it's delicious. The boyfriend and I went there for dinner on Monday night, which is a great night to go if you don't want to wait. We ordered our usual - a caesar salad and the gladiator pizza - sausage and pepperoni.  Our waitress was nice enough to split the salad on two plates for us. We both love this salad. It has a rich and tangy dressing, huge croutons and lots of shaved slices of fresh parmesan cheese. The cheese really makes this salad IMO. And the portion is perfect for two people. Kinda like the pizza. It's just the right size to share. If you have 3 or 4 people in your group definitely get more than one. The crust is thin and crispy, they use just the right amount of sauce and it's not overly greasy.   The atmosphere is cool but comfy and the service is always great. Parking can be a challenge but they do offer valet if you can't find a spot. And of course be sure to stop by the grocery afterwards - good stuff!

I'm a devout fan of Aloha Kitchen so I was hesitant to try another Hawaiian place here in the Valley. Especially one with mixed reviews. But it was convenient one day so the boyfriend and I decided to give it a go. And i'm happy we did!  We got the food to go - I got the BBQ combo (chicken and beef) and he got the katsu. Like most Hawaiian joints the portions were huge so bring your appetite. I thought the chicken and beef were both done very well. Juicy, flavorful and not too fatty or gristly. The mac salad was not as good as Aloha Kitchen but it was decent. The portion was a little skimpy too compared to the rest of the meal. But like I said, big portions overall so it was okay.  We also got a few manapua to try. Very good, tasted fresh.  When I find myself on the north end of town I would not hesitate to go back to Ono.

Stopped into Olive and Ivy for the first time yesterday and one of the first things I said to my boyfriend was "why haven't we been here before?"  Since we were there early, we decided to sit in the bar section of the patio and order off the happy hour menu. The food menu consists of a few different bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple other small bites.   We chose two bruschettas, bacon wrapped dates and a flatbread pizza with sausage. Everything was really tasty.  The pizza was the perfect size for two people to share. And the dates, stuffed with sausage, were fantastic! I highly recommend those! All in all it made for a great light(ish) dinner.  Everything from the atmosphere to the food to the service was great. The only weird thing was that they have an air freshener on the tree we were sitting under that squirts out air freshener at times. My boyfriend got sprayed quite heavily at one point - yuck! But regardless, we will be back!

So I know I'm late to the party and don't have a ton to add that hasn't already been said so I'll just say OMG their macaroons are amazing!  The croissants are fabulous as well. Light, flaky, oh-so-buttery. And they are fairly big. I brought two home, whipped up some eggs and bacon and made breakfast sandwiches with the. Super yummy. The chocolate croissants worth the extra calories as well.  But let's go back to these macaroons they have. Wow. They are just a little crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside and the flavors really come through. The pumpkin is just delish - even if it's not fall!  Sure this isn't the cheapest place in town but you get what you pay for. It's worth it for bakery items like this.

Perfection.  I don't know if I could love Mastro's more. Seriously this place is so amazingly good. Love it, love it, love it.  So now that my mouth is watering I'll tell you why.  My boyfriend took me to Mastro's City Hall for my birthday last November so in return I took him to Ocean Club for his birthday. We were feeling more casual (too hot to dress up) so we sat in the bar where you can still get the full menu. The bar was lively with a piano player singing old favorites (Billy Joel, Van Morrison, etc.)  To start the evening off I ordered a Peartini. I was a little surprised at the price $18! But when our waitress brought out the drink with the shaker, $18 didn't seem so bad anymore. I got about 2.5 glassfulls and the drink was really strong. I certainly got my money's worth. Even after I stuffed myself I still felt tipsy. And the drink was really yummy.  On to the food. First thing they bring out is their bread basket. I could seriously just eat that for dinner and be happy. It includes these pretzel rolls that are to die for. SO good! It's worth going to Mastro's for the bread basket alone. No kidding.  The boyfriend loves bacon wrapped scallops. we saw they had scallops on the menu so we asked if they could wrap them in bacon. The waitress said she would ask and came back to say they would. Yay! So we got the appetizer size to share and they blew us away. One, they were huge, two they were served with this fantastic buttery sauce. They were cooked just right, they melted in our mouths.  Next we decided to split a filet and get a side of au gratin potatoes. The steak comes out on a sizzling plate and the potatoes were served in an iron skillet. The steak was great, cooked just right and full of flavor. The potatoes were drowning in cheddar cheese - almost too much but we're from the midwest where there really is no such this as too much cheese.  We were getting full but it was boyfriend's birthday so of course we had to order the butter cake. Wow. This cake is fantastic. We were expecting a slice of cake with butter cream frosting but instead we got a mini cake, kind of like a rum cake without the rum. On top was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was surrounded by slices of oranges and strawberries. Oh, and it's served with a huge side of real whipped cream. No Reddi-whip here! This cake is out of this world. One of the best deserts anywhere.  On top of the great food we had a fantastic waitress. She was fun, helpful, didn't rush us, she did everything just right. A good waitress can add so much to the experience and she really helped make our evening special.  I can't wait until I can get back to Mastro's again. By far my favorite steak house in town.

Cornish Pasty Company is one of those rare places that makes you feel like you're somewhere special. A unique concept - at least I've never seen any other pasty restaurants around - makes this place truly one of a kind.  I have two favorites when I'm there. 1. the Royale with cheese with a side of ranch. 2. the pilgrim with a side of red wine gravy. The Royale with cheese is what you think it is - burger related. It's hamburger, cheese, onion, mushrooms bacon, and the best part - fries all snuggled into a flaky pasty crust. I like to dip mine into ranch for that classic burger tastiness. The Pilgrim is thanksgiving dinner. It's turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and onions. Served with a side of cranberries and gravy.  I always have a hard time choosing between the two because they are both so delicious.   The place itself has a cool, laid back vibe and the staff is always friendly.  The pasties do take a while to make though so expect to wait a while. These are not fast food in any sense of the term. If you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Especially at lunch.  Also, their seating is really best set up for groups of two.  This is not a "take the whole family out for dinner" kinda place. They have a couple tables in the back that can seat four but the majority of tables are two-tops and then there is space at the bar.  No question, Cornish Pasty Company is one of my favorite places in the valley.

A co-worker and I wanted to go off of our regular route for lunch so we headed over to Wildflower Bread Company for a change of pace. So glad we did!  Their menu is pretty big - lots of salad, sandwiches and soup options. They also carry many baked goods that looked really yummy. I ordered the beef stew with fruit salad combo (I love combos!) and my friend ordered a salad. We sat down and our food was served almost immediately.  The portions are very generous. My beef stew was what you could call hearty. Big chunks of beef, potatoes and veggies. Even the broth was thick and flavorful. It tasted fresh made, not out of a can. My fruit salad was fresh as well and had lots of strawberries, grapes and pineapple. Nothing worse than fruit salad that's nothing but cantaloupe. The fruit was served on top of greens with some kind of yogurt - very tasty. The sweet and light fruit was a nice counterbalance to the heavy stew. My meal also came with bread so needless to say I did not go home hungry.  The only downside to this place is the parking. There are a lot of restaurants in this strip mall so lunchtime gets really busy. We had to park pretty far away from Wildflower and walk over. Not a big deal when it's nice out but in the summer it could get kinda hot.

Warning. Yupha's likes it hot. Their mild is not so mild.  I'll admit I'm not that into spicy food. Wherever I go for thai food I always order the mild. Usually that means little to no spice. At Yupha's mild means spicy. I ordered the pad pak - mixed veggies with chicken. It was so hot my tongue was burning. So I asked the waitress if I could get it remade and se did accommodate me and told me "next time order no spice" will do! But then not 5 minutes later I overheard a guy saying the same thing about his pad thai - too spicy. So at least it's not  just me!  When I got my fresh order it was delicious. A nice mix of veggies and flavorful sauce - just no spice! And the servings are huge! I had plenty left over for another meal.  So if you like spicy food you'll get your fill here. If you don't, remember to order no spice or get ready for your tastebuds to go up in flames.

If I could only use one word to describe my dining experience at Valle Luna it would be LOUD. If you want to have a conversation, get ready to yell at the person sitting across from you.  My family and I went there on a Friday night. After a short wait we were seated in a booth right by where the waitstaff comes out from the kitchen and bar, which definitely contributed to the noise.  The place is pretty crowded and the atmosphere was one of general chaos. I saw the waitstaff running on more than one occasion and there were lots of kids screaming and running around, too. Not a great place for a relaxing dinner after a long week at work. Our server was fine - not particularly friendly but not rude. She just kinda went through the motions. I ordered the fish tacos with black beans and rice. For as lively as the restaurant was, the food was rather lacking. Well, the entr√©e anyway, the chips and salsa were good. The fish in my tacos was small and overcooked and the tortillas were kinda dry. The rice and beans were just okay, nothing special.   Afterwards, I just felt bloated and gross. There are way better options for Mexican food in this town. I won't be going back to Valle Luna any time soon.

I had seen all the good reviews on Yelp so I expected a good meal at Roy's but I was still pleased at how good the food actually was.  The boyfriend and i hit up Roy's on a Friday night. We didn't have reservations so we were offered a table in the bar. The bar isn't very big but it was full so it was pretty loud. The noise was a tad distracting so I might try the dining room next time.  But other than that we had a nice time. I ordered a Mai Tai to drink and the Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi for my entree. Boyfriend ordered the filet. The Mai Tai was yummy and rummy. Although a bit on the pricey side - $12. I did not order a second. My Mahi Mahi was served with new potatoes and gravy and asparagus. The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor. The potatoes were nice and tender and the asparagus was good too. The portion of the fish was quite large. Boyfriend's filet was tasty as well. Slightly more done than he likes it but not overdone. The steak comes with mashed potatoes (with bacon!) and broccoli. He did not hesitate in cleaning his plate.  For desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. Maybe I was just too full but I found this to be a little underwhelming. The ice cream was more like frozen yogurt and while the cake was full of oozing chocolate it just didn't have that decadent chocolate taste I was hoping for.  Overall I was very happy with my night at Roy's. I would definitely go back.

Went to Jason's Deli to try out their salad bar yesterday. It was my first experience with their salad bar and I'm sorry to say it will be my last. I was very disappointed with their offerings. On their website they said they have added organic options but there were no signs saying what was organic so who knows if anything was. Their toppings weren't salad topping as much as they were veggies. Example: whole baby carrots are not what I would consider a salad topping unless I want to cut up the carrots myself. I will say I managed to put a little more than lettuce on my plate, so fine. I also tried one of the pasta salads - yuck. It had almost a sour flavor to it. And I tried some of the fruit salad - tasted chemically - they probably spray their fruit so it doesn't brown.  Their "famous" mini muffins were also a major disappointment. The cornbread one was dry, the gingerbread one was just okay. Again, kinda fake tasting.   And really, for the price I would expect some kind of meat offering - chicken or turkey would be nice.  But the worst part came later that afternoon when I got a horrible stomach ache.    Never again.

This place is not that easy to find but I'm glad I hung in there and found it because I really liked it.  Stopped in for lunch last week to try something new. When I walked in I was immediately greeted. The man behind the counter asked if I had been in before and when I said no gave me several recommendations. He also told me the make all their mayos and sauces there. A big plus in my book. I decided to try the Vermonter with a side of pasta salad.  The sandwich was plenty big and the bread was fresh (always important). The turkey and ham were tasty and the sliced apple was a nice touch. It was a little light on the cranberry mayo though. The couple bites I had where I could taste it I thought it was really good - would have loved more!  The pasta salad hada good flavor but the noodles were either undercooked or dried out. Kinda seemed dried out. They were a little hard for pasta salad IMO.  They have a few tables inside but more tables outside which was great since the weather was nice. Could get a little crowded inside in the summer.  Overall I really liked this place and now that I know how to find it I would go back.

I think I just found my new favorite Mexican joint. Like other Yelpers say, this place isn't much to look at on the outside but they are cooking up some awesome food inside.  I ordered the #10 which is a carne asada taco, a quesadilla, rice and beans. I went for the taco first. Their tacos are small but mighty. The meat was tender and the salsa had a kick but was no overpowering - very flavorful. Next was the quesadilla. Granted, it's hard to mess up melted cheese in a tortilla but definitely hit the mark if ooey gooey cheese is your thing.  I thought the rice and beans were really good too. Dipping the quesadilla in the beans made it that much more awesome.   The staff was very friendly - they greeted us right away when we came in and thanked us on our way out.   I'm very much looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other kinds of tacos - chicken, al pastor, carnitas - yum!!

The boyfriend and I were in the mood for pizza and wings last night so we decided to head over to one of our favorite places for dough and chicken - NYPD Pizza.  We've been there several times so we pretty much knew what we wanted before we even got there. Cheesy garlic knots and honey BBQ wings were a must. But then I ordered a small caesar salad and he ordered a calzone. We've had their pizza before and we both think it's really tasty - good crust.  The garlic knots are SOOO good. Little garlicy dough balls covered in mozzarella cheese and served with a side of marinara. Yummmm-o! Both the knots and the wings came out quickly and were piping hot. The wings are good too, they slather on the tasty sauce.  The boyfriend's calzone came out later (they told us calzone's take a while) and it was ginormous. Seriously, this thing was like a large pizza folded in half. You could easily feed two with that behemoth.  The service at NYPD is always friendly and fast. So while I wouldn't say it's the most remarkable place in town it's a great, dependable place to get flavorful food.

The Junk Guys were absolutely fantastic!   I just bought a house and the previous owner left a ton of stuff behind, especially in the garage and storage closet. The junk guys cleaned up everything super fast. They even went into the closet and sorted through decades of bottles of cleaners, sodas and you-name-its, taking everything they could (they can't take toxic stuff like paint). In the garage they even went through cabinets and drawers to clean it all out. They saved me hours of back-breaking work.   Then I had them come back the next week to haul out all the carpet I had ripped out and other more "home-renovation" type garbage. As I continue to move through my home renovation I am already creating another pile of junk and I know exactly who I'm going to call. The Junk Guys are worth every penny. I highly recommend them!

Okay so I'm a little late to the game here. But in this case, better late than never because St. Francis was awesome!  The boyfriend and I headed to St. Francis for breakfast/brunch on Sunday. We thought if we went later we'd miss the crowd. We were wrong. We got there close to 11AM and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We ended up waiting only about 20 or so because we were willing to sit outside.  We decided to split a couple things so we ordered the eggs benedict with salmon and the baked pancake. The eggs benedict was delicious. I highly recommend the salmon. It wasn't overly fishy, it was a great combination with the eggs and hollandaise sauce. I was a little bummed that it didn't come with anything - no potatoes or fruit - would have been nice.  The pancake was SO rich. A good thing to share. It's like a pancake/cupcake/bread thing more than a straight up pancake. They fill it with chocolate and top it with berries and cream. Could have used a little more cream on top but overall it was really, really good. Don't let the olive oil weird you out - it works.  We were very happy with our food and the atmosphere. There was a live band with added a nice touch to the morning dining. I would definitely go back for breakfast and would love to try their dinner sometime.

I won't say I'm short but I find that a lot of pants I buy are too long. I have taken several pairs of pants here and have always been satisfied. I have had both jeans and dress pants done here and been pleased with both. For $10 you can't beat it.

Love the sweet treat that is a Sprinkles cupcake. So much joy wrapped up in a delicious handful of cake and frosting goodness.  I have had several of their flavors with my favorites being red velvet, strawberry, dark chocolate and chocolate vanilla. I'm not a big fan of frosting, I always like the cake part better and there is a lot of frosting on these cupcakes. I do like the flavors in their frosting but it can be a little too much at times.   The dry mixes that they sell in the store (and at Williams-Sonoma) are a great way to make your own cupcakes at home. They taste very close to the in-store version and you can control how big or small you make the cupcakes. At least the red velvet mix was good, I haven't tried any others.  Sprinkles makes me smile. It's a little joy that's worth the $3.00 every time.

I am in love with Switch. I have only been there a few times but each time the food has been delicious.  I like the laid back atmosphere and the service has always been great too. the have a huge menu, lots of options for salads, sandwiches and more. Large drink menu as well.  Recommended - the burgers, the chicken sandwich, the hummus, the mac and cheese and the sangria.

For a laid-back little burger joint Stax is a great option. I mean, how can you go wrong with a place that has tots!  Their burgers are small but tasty. They are jumbo sliders so order one if you're a light eater or two if you're really hungry. Sometimes they can be a little overcooked but generally they are nice and juicy. I usually get one burger, my boyfriend gets one or two and we share a side and are left full and happy.  They have good sides - regular fries, sweet potato fries and tots with various dipping sauces. I tried their mac and cheese once. It was just okay.  They have a nice little patio where you can sit and watch the traffic on Scottsdale rd as you scarf down your burger. And the staff has always been very friendly and attentive.

This place is like half movie theatre, half bizzaro museum. It's worth going to just for the weird statues and creepy wax figures that stare at you from every corner.   The movies are only three bucks so you can't beat that. The theaters themselves are okay, nothing fancy for sure, and sometimes the sound quality isn't the best. But hey, it's three bucks.  I figure I'm paying $1.50 for the movie and a $1.50 for the entertainment of the statues.  I just wish Pollack would open up a museum of his whole collection. I hear he has a ton of stuff. I wanna see it!!!

I don't understand the lack of love here for Qdoba. Maybe everyone has been sucked into the Chipotle burrito-sphere and the refried beans are affecting their brains. There are enough tortillas in the world to support more than one fast food burrito joint, people!  Don't get me wrong. I like Chipotle too. I will enjoy a burrito bowl there from time to time. But Qdoba has one thing Chipotle doesn't offer - their queso dip. A squirt of cheesy heaven, Qdoba's queso makes everything taste better.   My favorite thing to get is their nachos. They load 'em with beans, your choice of meat, salsa, cheese, sour cream and 3-cheese queso. YUM! You get a heaping serving of salty yumminess for like $6.00. If I'm starving I can finish a whole plateful but there is certainly enough to share.  So do yourself a favor and indulge in a little queso therapy next time you're craving some fast mexican food. You may never visit Chipotle again.

Just picked up my second Bountiful Basket and I have to say I love it as much as the first one. Today we got: mangos, cherries, green grapes, bananas, a cantaloupe, romaine lettuce, an onion, celery, green peppers, butternut squash and cherry tomatoes. All of it was in great condition. I already ate one of the mangos and it was delish.  I love the surprise of not knowing what is going to be in the basket every week and the the challenge of figuring out what to do with it all. Especially with veggies I've never cooked before. Thank god for the internet and the abundance of recipes out there.  There are only two of us in our household and one basket is more than enough. For $15 you really do get a ton of food.  My only wish is that that food was more local. Maybe that's tough in AZ in the summer but I know there are foods that grow here and I would love to see them in the baskets! Also if they could have smaller add-ons. I don't have room in my house for 5 loaves of bread! :)  Other than that I have been very happy with the food and the volunteers. I plan to make this a regular thing for sure.

The boyfriend took me to Mastro's City Hall for my birthday last night and I have to say this place may become a birthday tradition. I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate.  First, they brought out a huge bread basket. The rolls were so fresh and delicious. The pretzel rolls are amazing. The perfect way to start. Then, we each got a petite filet and the mac and cheese and sweet potato fries for our sides. Everything was so good. The steak was done perfectly, very very tender and every bite was delicious. I usually add salt to my steak but this one was so flavorful I didn't need it. It comes on a hot plate, similar to Ruth's Chris but without the butter.   The sides were tasty as well. The sweet potato fries were probably the best I've ever had and the mac and cheese was very decadent.    When my boyfriend made reservations he had mentioned it was my birthday. It was such a surprise when they came to the table with a huge slice of chocolate cake with "Happy Birthday Holly" written on the plate in chocolate. It really made the evening extra special.  And the service was outstanding. Our water glasses were never less than half-full, the food was paced perfectly and our waiter was friendly and attentive. They even called today to make sure we had a good experience. You don't see that kind of follow up very often.  I can't wait to visit Mastro's City Hall again. I may need to figure out an excuse to celebrate before my next birthday!

Yum. Yum. Yum. I just got back from a trip to Hawaii a few weeks ago and have been craving Hawaiian food. I had heard about this place awhile ago so I was hoping could cure my tastebud's island blues. I'm not even kidding, this place was just as good if not better than some of the places I tried in Honolulu. Mahalo Mai Island Grill, you made this mainlander's day.  They are only open for lunch (too bad) and it was packed! I thought maybe because ASU is on winter break it might not be as busy but I was wrong. The place is tiny - only 4 tables inside that barely seat 3 and a couple tables outside.  I had the grilled mahi-mahi. Each order comes with a scoop of rice, a scoop of mac salad, and some lettuce under the meat. The fish was very tasty, not dry at all, and the serving was two decent sized pieces. The rice was a tad bit mushy but still good. The mac salad was delish! It had almost a sweetness to it that balanced the saltiness of the rest of the food.  Mai Island also serves Hawaiian Sun drinks which I have not seen anywhere else so you can enjoy guava juice or other tropical juices with your meal.  Someone else had mentioned that they had spam musubi. I didn't see it on the menu so either they don't serve it anymore or it's a special off menu item.  I will most definitely be returning to Mai Island Grill. I can't wait to try the Loco Moco! I just wish they were open on weekends!!

NOOOOOOOOO!!!! I'm SO bummed that Mai Island closed. Tried to go there for lunch today only to find a Gyro joint in it's place. I just about started to cry.  Mai Island, if you ever open again please let me know! I will be there ready and waiting for some chicken katsu.   Mahalo!

There's nothing better than an old burger joint that really gets it. Lucky Boy is one of those places. One Saturday afternoon the boyfriend and I met a friend at Lucky Boy for lunch. We both ordered regular cheeseburgers and fries, the friend ordered the BBQ burger and I also ordered a chocolate/banana malt.  The burger was done just right. Nice and juicy and they were very generous with the toppings. I actually scraped some of the ketchup and mustard off. The fries were great too. But the malt was amazing! SO thick I used the straw as a spoon. Great chocolate flavor, big chunks of banana - yum! The friend said the BBQ burger was also very tasty.  The place itself is small with only 3 tables and a few stools at a counter near the windows but it has a certain charm.  I will definitely be going back to Lucky Boy if for no other reason than to get another malt.

In a city full of chain coffee shops it's nice to find this gem tucked away inside a dull strip mall.   It's a small place but laid out in such a way that allows for a good numbers of tables and a couch area. The atmosphere is laid-back and comfortable and the people working behind the counter are friendly.  I can't speak to the coffee section but they have a decent loose-leaf tea selection and they will make it iced or hot.  The only thing I found lacking was a selection of snacks. Sometimes it's nice to grab a muffin or a cookie when you're hanging out.  If you're looking for a good alternative to Starbucks or just want a place to hang out and read or study, Solo Cafe is an excellent option.

The boyfriend and I were looking to branch out from our usual breakfast haunts but the minute we pulled up to Black Bear Diner we should have kept driving to The Farmhouse in Gilbert. One look at this place and we should have known this was not gonna be great.  Black Bear Diner is pretty much a bear-themed Denny's. I ordered the "small portion" breakfast and boyfriend ordered pancakes. My small breakfast was 2 eggs, a huge portion of hashbrowns, a gigantic biscuit and bacon. There was nothing small about this breakfast. The menu said for seniors and smaller appetites. They've got some hungry seniors in Gilbert apparently.  The eggs were tasteless and the bacon was meh. The hashbrowns were good though, I'll give them that. Boyfriend's pancakes were also flavorless and really thick and heavy. Nothing light and fluffy about these flapjacks. They were kinda like a brick with syrup.  We left feeling like we had wasted our weekend breakfast. Maybe lunch or dinner is better but I don't think we'll be back to find out.

Can't say I was too impressed with my night at Geisha A Go Go. It was a friend's birthday and some other friends reserved a private karaoke room for 10 people.   Walking in I was shocked to see how small the room was. There was a small bench and 10 of us had to squeeze to even fit. It was not very comfortable - especially for the people sitting in the corner. It was also very hot in the room so that did not help matters.  I was also surprised the room was not decorated better. Just 4 blank walls - boring.  We had the room reserved from 7 to 9. I know for a fact we arrived after 7 because I hate to be late. As we were getting settled in the waitress told us which drinks and sushi were on happy hour. Great, we thought - let's all order half price drinks. So we ordered accordingly - happily getting drinks and sushi on the "happy hour" list. Well when the bill came everything was full price! When I asked the waitress she said "when I told you about it, it was still happy hour but when you ordered it wasn't happy hour anymore." Wow, seriously? That's shady. I didn't want to make a scene since it was my friend's birthday but that really bugged me. I looked on their site later to find happy hour ends at 7 so she should have never told us that in the first place. Or at least told us when we finally did place our order. Bad waitress!  The room comes with free apps and sushi which is cool considering the price of the room. The food was all good but nothing amazing. There are other sushi places in town I would go to before going back here. The drinks were pretty mediocre as well. The names are better than the beverages themselves.  Needless to say I do not think I will be returning anytime soon.

mmmmmmmmmeat!  When I'm in the mood to pig out, and don't want to drive all the way to Bobby Q, I head to Famous Dave's. You get a lot of BBQ bang for your buck at this place. I don't think I've ever left there without leftovers.  This weekend the boyfriend and I decided we were craving some good all-american pig out food so we headed over to FDs to get our glutton on. I ordered the brisket meal and he ordered the chicken wings. Each platter comes with two sides (and corn and cornbread - told you you'd be pigging out) so I chose the mac and cheese and the fries. They changed their mac and cheese recently and I have to admit I wasn't that thrilled with it. It used to be standard, old-school mac and cheese. Now it has corn and jalapenos in it. It was okay but I like the simple stuff with BBQ. The rest of the food was great. I tried the Dr. Pepper glaze on the brisket which was good, not too sweet.  We had a really nice server and the whole experience was just easy and fast - which is just what you want on a Friday night after a long, busy work week.  We left there stuffed, satisfied and with a box full of leftovers for later. We'll be back!

Ranch House Grill gets a big fat "Meh" from me. I love breakfast joints and am always looking for new places to try. When I got a Groupon for Ranch House Grill I was hoping I would find a new place to add to our rotating list of breakfast hot spots. Not so much.  The boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday morning, there was a wait but nothing too long. I ordered the special - cinnamon raisin french toast, eggs and bacon. Boyfriend got a ham and cheese omelet which he did say was pretty good. My food was okay but nothing special. The french toast was kinda small and didn't have a ton of flavor. Eggs were fine, bacon was okay. There was nothing bad about the food but there just wasn't anything great about it either. At least nothing to make me want to go back. Except maybe the Savers down the street - I found some great clothes there!

Talk about a hidden gem. Apache is not usually the first place I think about when looking for a place to eat, but Guerreo's may have just changed that. Apparently it's been there for years, who knew! It's one of those places you'll drive by a million times (at least I did) but it's worth stopping by at least once.  The boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday for lunch. The place is tiny (like 3 tables inside tiny) but we were the only ones there so it was not an issue. The guy behind the counter was friendly in an old-guy-who's-been-there-forever-and-you-look-forward-to-seeing kinda way. I ordered a beef tamale and a cheese enchilada. Now I'm totally serious you guys, this was the BEST enchilada I have ever eaten and I don't even like raw onions (was not expecting those). I don't know why it was so good but it was AH-MAZ-ING. I'm craving it now just writing about it. The tamale was good too but majorly overshadowed by the enchilada's awesomeness.   This place is cheap, friendly, and downright delicious. They do close early (7pm) so make sure you go in time, you won't regret it.

It's pretty hard to mess up a cupcake. Although, there are definitely ways to make a cupcake amazing. When I want an amazing cupcake I will go to Sprinkles. if I want a cupcake that's pretty good, can't complain about it, I may go back to Cake Cafe.  This place is a little bit hidden in the mess of stores that is the area of Ray Rd. and I-10. It's a small but cute shop with a few tables inside. They have a wide variety of cupcake flavors and they are only $2.00 each which is a huge plus. They also serve coffee drinks if you're into that. They had some fun flavors like peanut butter, pumpkin chocolate chip, cherry, and blueberry. I chose the white fudge which was white cake with a fudgy frosting.   The cupcake was good. It had a homemade quality to it but not a homemade from scratch quality - more of a homemade by way of Betty Crocker cupcake mix quality.  I did like the frosting and I'm pretty picky about frosting. It was nice and fudgy and not too sweet. The cake itself was moist, tasted fresh and had a good flavor.  Overall I would go back, especially if I wanted to get a bunch of cupcakes and didn't want to empty out my bank account at Sprinkles.

We did a full kitchen remodel and needed all new appliances. Spencer's was way more helpful than the big box stores. I went into Sears and didn't even get a hello. We went to several different Spencer's locations since each store has different inventory and ultimately ended up piecing items together with what was in store and what was available on their site. Paul helped us place the order and was very helpful, outlining the exact price of every item and how we could best take advantage of a rebate that Bosch was offering.   I loved that they will hold the appliances for you until you are ready for them, as we needed to install our cabinets before we could install the appliances but needed appliance sizes to build to.  There was a small mix-up when we had the appliances delivered. We were supposed to have installation but they accidentally forgot to the mark that on the paperwork. I called Paul, he apologized profusely and had someone come out the next day.  I would definitely recommend Spencer's to anyone shopping for appliances.

Culver's gets five stars on their custard alone. If you've never had it before, if it's done right, frozen custard is like the richest, creamiest ice cream you've ever had.   Being MN/WI transplants, the boyfriend and I were quite excited when Culver's opened up in AZ and have since introduce many friends to the joy that is frozen custard. Now, in WI frozen custard is quite common and Culver's actually lands towards the bottom of the list for custard places. But here in AZ, Culver's shoots right to the top.   They have a nice variety for their flavors of the day and if you're not into that you can make your own sundae. They have shakes too and in the fall they have a pumpkin pie shake that is the best thing in the world. it really tastes like pumpkin pie in a cup.  Their burgers are good, not my favorite. Surprisingly they have really good salads - I know, right? The boyfriend loves the cashew chicken salad and I adore the strawberry salad.   They also have cheese curds which is great when I need a little bite of home.  Their staff is usually very friendly too, which is a nice change from some fast food places where they barely say hello to you.  So grab your Packers jacket and head over to Culver's for some dairyland delight.

Stopped by here for lunch on a Saturday. Even though it was later in the afternoon (after 1) it was still packed. But we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.   The great thing about a revolving sushi restaurant is that you don't have to wait for your food. As soon as you sit down you can start grabbing. We tried several different items -the best were the rainbow roll, the potstickers and the tamago, which is a sweet egg sushi that I'd never had before. Overall the sushi was decent, not the best I've ever had but I wasn't really expecting that honestly.   But it's great because you can eat just as much as you want and you can try new things because it's only a buck or two per plate. I thought it was a ton of fun, the food was decent and it's cheap. A great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.

I was not overly impressed with Pink Spot. I went there on a Saturday night with some friends and it took us forever to get our ice cream. We all ordered cones except for one of us. They didn't have a ton of flavors to choose from, although they did have some interesting options like Birthday Cake and Root Beer Float so they get a point for that.  The portions are very large but the ice cream itself is just okay. I had the chocolate peanut butter and I have to say the chocolate peanut butter at Baskin Robbins is better.  I would not go out of my way to visit Pink Spot again.

For years now I have been disappointed time and time again by Chinese restaurants around the valley. I really thought there was just no good Chinese food to be found. Until Hot Wok! Finally, real, good Chinese food!!  Hot Wok is BY FAR the best I have found. The portions are huge and the prices are good. I can order a small and get two meals from it.  My favorite is the chicken with mixed vegetables. The chicken is not breaded and the veggies are a nice mix - broccoli, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, water chestnuts and onion. It's served in a sauce that is so flavorful my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I've also had the chicken with string beans and that was tasty as well.  A favorite of the boyfriend is the pineapple chicken. Breaded chicken with a tangy fruity sauce and big chunks of pineapple.  Their cream cheese wontons are good too but it's pretty hard to mess those up.  This is definitely a take-out place. They do have tables, but it's nothing special.

This review is not for the restaurant but for the little stand they had set up outside the jobing.com arena. The boyfriend and I went to jobing.com for a concert the other night and Westgate was packed. There were long lines trailing out the door at every restaurant. We kind of wandered around in a daze of overstimulation for a while and then we walked by Shane's set-up. They were offering chicken or pork sandwiches, mac n cheese, chips and cookies. Perfect!  I ordered the pulled pork, boyfriend had the chicken. We both ordered the mac n cheese. Now, it wasn't cheap. I don't know what it's like inside, but at the stand two sandwiches, two macs and one bottle of water will cost you $20. But we were hungry and I guess we were paying for convenience.  Luckily, the food was really good! Boyfriend did say his chicken was a little dry but my pulled pork was nice and tender. The sauce was flavorful and not too spicy. The mac n cheese was really good. Some reviewers said it was bland - I disagree. I thought it was rich and creamy with ample cheesy flavor.   The food filled us up for a night of rockin' out. I would go back and try sitting inside Shane's next time.

I think what I like most about F&E is that it's kind of like the anti-Costco. When there are only two of you in your household you don't always need the 5lb block of cheese or 30 cupcakes. F&E caters to the single folks and the childless couples. I can buy 2 cupcakes? Perfect!  Another thing I like about F&E is that they offer a lot of "meal-helpers" like chicken tenders, salmon with a sauce to serve it with and side dishes like potatoes or mac n cheese. And even though they're pretty much pre-packaged dinners you just throw in the oven they aren't filled with a ton of preservatives and weird ingredients. For the most part it's pretty much just food.  They have a decent selection throughout, not as big as other big chain grocery stores but you can get pretty much everything on your shopping list. And if you want to try anything that is F&E brand they'll open up the package for you and let you sample.   The one thing I'm not too crazy about is the amount of packaging they use. I get why that it's pretty much dictated by their store model and at least it's recyclable but if they could figure out some way to reduce the size or something that would be awesome - especially for the produce. But at least I only have to buy 4 apples and not a bushel.

After reading all the rave reviews about BLT Steak's happy hour I wanted to try it for myself. Yelpers, once again you have not failed me. The rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic.   Boyfriend and I snagged ourselves a comfy spot on a couch next to the firepit on the patio. The atmosphere is comfortable, romantic and warm. We were immediately greeted by our waitress who pointed out the happy hour menu. They have several drink options and many food options. We were there for the food and ordered a few items to share - the popovers (a must), the charcuterie plate, the burger and the truffle fries.  Hands down the standout of the night was the popovers. They were huge, fluffy, and full of eggy goodness. They are served with butter and salt - it's really all they need - yum! But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself. Everyone who says get the popovers is right - get the popovers!  The burger was very tasty. A good size - plenty for sharing and cooked just right. The fries were my least favorite. I was excited by the description - truffle fries with parmesan cheese - but the fries were overcooked (too hard) and the truffle was overpowering. Not my thing I guess.  The service was really good too. Even though you'd spend WAY more on dinner inside I never felt like I was part of the cheap crowd. I felt like we were treated the same way we would be if we were dropping $200 even though we dropped less that $50. I appreciated that and it's smart because now I'm very likely to come back and blow a wad on a special occasion! Well played, BLT Steak!   I highly recommend BLT Steak's happy hour. It was the dining highlight of my weekend.

If there was one word to describe my experience at metro it would be - beignets!    But before I get to the best part, let me start at the beginning. The boyfriend and I decided to try Metro after seeing their menu as part of Yelp Eats. We didn't make it there during the event but still wanted to check it out anyway. We went on a Friday night after work and the place was busy but not packed so we were seated right away. The menu is somewhat small but with many tasty looking options. One thing I would have liked were better descriptions of what the food was. I don't know much about French food so there were several items that were unfamiliar to me, including what I ordered.  It was listed as a Croque Monsieur O Madame and was described as ham and cheese on bread (essentially.) But when I went to order it the waiter asked me "which one?" I guess I should have realized the O was OR but there was only one option on the menu so I was confused. He said the Madame meant it came with an egg.  Maybe if you're really into french food you know this. I didn't, and I think it should be listed on the menu. Plus Madame = egg. Well okay yeah I get it but, ew?  The boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger. No confusion there! He got a side salad and I got fries as my side because that's the kind of lady I am. And we got an extra side of mac and cheese - It had been a long week.   First I have to mention the bread that comes out before the meal was SO good. You get a bucket of mini baguettes with herb butter. Delish!  Our food came out quickly. My sandwich was huge. And I will say the egg kinda made the dish. The bread was a little hard but otherwise it had a good flavor. The fries (or should I say pommes frites!) were amazing. They had an herb seasoning on them ad they came with an aoli on the side for dipping. YUM.  The boyfriend said the burger was just okay, a little dry and overcooked.   The mac and cheese was very tasty - served in a little cast iron dish so it stayed warm for a long time. And the breadcrumbs on top were a nice touch.  Okay, so now we get to the best part. Being a donut lover of course we had to order beignets. They come 6 to a plate with 3 dipping sauces - chocolate, vanilla and raspberry. They were so fresh and soft and the sauces were flavorful. The perfect end to the dinner. The only minus was that they were $7. That's over a dollar per beignet. Full sized donuts are 80 cents. But they were good so I let it slide.  So if nothing else I'd go back just for the fries and beignets.  Au Revoir!

So after discovering that Mai Island Grill closed the boyfriend and I tried to be optimistic and try "the other place down the street" - Paradise.  Boooo. It completely pales in comparison. I got the lunch special which included BBQ chicken, BBQ beef and Meat Jun. The chicken was meh, the beef was hard to chew, but the Meet Jun was pretty good. Hence the two stars instead of one.  You do get a lot of food. The meat comes with two scoops of rice and your choice of sides. I chose the mac salad (given) and veggies. The mac salad was okay, very creamy. But my veggies were cold. Like intentionally cold, not just that they had cooled off. I thought this was weird. Cold corn? Chilled cooked zucchini? No thanks.  Boyfriend had the katsu. It was decent but not outstanding. Overall it seemed like they use pretty low grade meat. As he put it - "lots of knuckles." Yuck.  I might go back to try the pork or the spam musubi - at least you know what to expect from spam - but I won't be running back anytime soon. Maybe once my stomach ache goes away I'll feel better about the place.

Okay I'll admit I'm a little late to the Hanny's party. It's been on the list for a while but until last night I hadn't been able to cross it off.  The boyfriend is a huge fan of pizza (what guy isn't?) so I suggested we finally check this place out before the show we were going to. We arrived at about 6:30 (it was a Friday) and the place was packed. Not one open table. Apparently it's popular with the business crowd for happy hour as there were lots of suits. Luckily there were a couple seats at the bar so we settled in there.  We ordered two pizzas - one with pepperoni and onion and one with prosciutto (my addition lately) and apple, sans tomato sauce. They came out relatively quickly and were nice and hot. The crackery crust makes them very different than other pizzas around town. Both pizzas were very flavorful and there was an ample amount of toppings on both. The pizzas aren't huge but there were a few slices left over so we were full and happy.  The atmosphere at Hanny's is pretty cool. Modern with kind of a retro vibe. But the best part is the bathrooms. Just check them out - trust me. It's worth going there just for that.

Maybe this place should change their name to Big Burger because these suckers are huge! And oh, so tasty.  The boyfriend, his mom and I went here on a Saturday afternoon. The place is not very big and was about half full but we managed to snag a booth. We all ordered burgers of course although they do offer other sandwiches and salads.  We all chose the build your own burger option, boyfriend and I going with grass-fed and mom going for the bison.  I went pretty standard on mine - American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo on a white bun. Like I said earlier the burger is huge and they do not skimp on cheese. (yay!) I cut it in half and dove in. The meat was cooked really well, just a little pink and was super cheesy. The bun was fresh too. From the first bite to the last it was a wonderful, messy, delicious experience. Boyfriend and mom agreed between burger-filled slurps and chomps.  One thing to note, these burgers ain't cheap. They start at around $11 and go up from there depending on what kind of meat and topping you choose. But it does include a side, so there's that.  I would definitely go back here to stuff my face with a sloppy burger and fries again. Yum.

Visited Blanco for the first time for a work happy hour get-together. There were about 15 of us but we made reservations so we got a great table right by the bar.    We ordered a few rounds of drinks and some guacamole to go with the chips and salsa. I had a peach margarita in a sugar-rimmed glass. It was really yummy and they did not skimp on the alcohol! The chips, salsa and guacamole were also really good. The guacamole had huge chunks of fresh avocado in it, which I really enjoyed - you could tell this was not out a can!  The whole time our server was super attentive. Our water glasses and chip bowls were always full, and he was constantly on top of making sure we had enough drinks without being pushy. Juggling a table this big can be tricky but we felt very taken care of the whole time.  If you have a big group, Blanco is very accommodating. I didn't get to try dinner but I would love to go back and try some of their tacos.

Made my way over to the Awhatukee Farmer's Market for the first time last weekend and was quite pleased with it. I love that it's on Sundays because I'm usually busy with other things on Saturdays.  It's not huge but it had plenty of yummy foods to tempt me. Like the lavender pepper. When would I ever use this? No idea. But in that moment I thought it seemed amazing. My only complaint was that I got there late (noonish) so they really wasn't much left in the way of produce. Partly because there were only maybe 2 stands selling produce in the first place. Maybe because it's winter? Or I guess I just need to get up earlier.  But there were lots of grass-fed meat stands which was cool. I'm definitely going to go back and try some out.  I walked away with a loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry honey that is really, really good.  Expect to spend money. This place ain't cheap. But at least you know you're getting quality food.

I've been attending classes at Express MiE for a few months now and I really love it. I don't think I've taken a class I didn't like.  My favorites so far have been Nia, Yoga Booty Ballet and Glee with MiE. But in all the classes, the vibe is positive, it doesn't matter if you don't get the moves quite perfect, and it's just simply a lot of fun.   Some classes are definitely harder than others. Dance Sculpt will get your muscles burning and I took a cardio class that included running, jumping rope and a gazillion squats. So there really is a class for every girl out there. If I'm looking for a more intense workout I just take two classes - they're only 45 minutes each so two classes won't eat up too much of your evening.  They change their schedule every six weeks or so so there is always something new to try. And all the classes are scheduled online so it's easy to know what's coming up and keep track of what you sign up for.  If you're looking for a fun way to workout try this place out. It's way more fun than a treadmill at the gym.

The boyfriend and I have been patrons of the Tempe location for years so last weekend when we happened to be in the Mesa area, we decided to give Cornish Pasty location #2 a shot.   First impression walking in the door was how much bigger this location is! There were lots of tables, several for big groups. The place is much lighter too, lots of windows. All the tables were sat so we grabbed seats at the bar.   The menu is bigger than the Tempe location. They have sides! And a couple more desert options as well. I didn't notice additional pasty options but we went for our usual anyway. We split a Royale with Cheese so we could save room for dessert. As always the pasty was cooked to perfection and stuffed with meaty, cheesey goodness. We were so temped to get a side. We saw what looked like the cheesy broccoli and cauliflower and it looked really good.  We ordered dessert - the chocolate bread and butter pudding. Wow was is rich and good. It's a big serving, enough for two, and it's served with a scoop of ice cream and a side of some kind of cream. It's very chocolaty and had a hint of brandy in it. The cream didn't do much for me but the ice cream cut the richness and was a nice compliment to it.  The staff here was super friendly and made our lunch very pleasant.   I highly recommend either location but if you have a big group or want to take your family, the Mesa location is the way to go.

From the outside Crazy Otto's looks like the kind of place I would pass by without a second glance. (Although the name is pretty catchy so I suppose I might look twice.) Inside the decor is simple, license plates adorn the walls and the tables are just tables. But where this place really stands out is in the food.  I had read the other reviews and expected to see gigantic pancakes. Crazy Otto's did not disappoint! These things were huge! The spilled off the platter. Platter mind you, not plate. The boyfriend ordered the stack of three. One would have been enough, even with me stealing a few bites. I ordered the eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The bacon was fine, nothing amazing, but the scrambled eggs were cooked just right and the hashbrowns were the best hashbrowns I have had in Phoenix. Only Al's Breakfast in Minneapolis has better 'browns. They were cut thicker than most and had a rich buttery potato flavor. I would go back to Crazy Otto's just for that alone.  Overall, I would say if you care more about what's on your plate than what's around you, you'll love breakfast at Crazy Otto's.

I was not really expecting to find good restaurants in Fountain Hills but I was pleasantly surprised. I actually found a couple great places, one of them being Sapori D'Italia.  The boyfriend and I visited Sapori on a Sunday night. It was busy but we got a table right away.  It was a little loud but overall the atmosphere was comfortable and our waitress was great - very friendly.  We couldn't decide between pizza and pasta so we got both - especially after we learned that we could do a half and half pizza. I can't remember the names of the pizzas but essentially we got half pepperoni and half prosciutto and arugala. For the pasta we ordered fettuccini with bolognese sauce.   The food came out very fast. First the pizza, then the pasta. Both were excellent. The pizza had ample toppings and the crust was nice and crispy. The pasta was tender and the sauce was awesome. Normally I don't like a ton of tomato sauce on my pasta but this was an exception. This was sop it up with a piece of bread good. It really hit the spot.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area. Good stuff!

New York's famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is now in Las Vegas, with a walk-up window even! That means you can get it without the hour-long wait for a table and the $$ minimum per person - woot! Granted, it's served in a plastic Caesars Palace cup instead of a fancy sundae glass and it's about half the size but whatever - it's still just as delicious and totally worth the $11.

Went to Papaya Thai for the first time with some friends on a Saturday night. I say that because of one really weird thing that happened - we were the only customers in there the entire time! I don't think I've ever experienced that. Especially on a Saturday night. his does not bode well for Papaya Thai, which is too bad because the food was pretty good.  I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to Thai food. I go mild all the way and sometimes even that can be too much. I decided to order veggies and chicken, (can't remember the name) mild, of course. The portion was large - lots of broccoli, carrots, bamboo shoots and potatoes (odd). There were too many onions for my taste but not a huge deal. The sauce was flavorful and even though I got mild there was still a bit of a kick. Mixed with some rice I was good to go. The leftovers reheated nicely the following night too.  My friends got curry, much hotter and they were pleased with the heat factor.  Overall we all really liked our food, the server was friendly and the place seemed clean. Hopefully they can drum up some business and stay open long enough for me to go back.

As a big breakfast lover I was pretty excited when I found out there was a new breakfast place opening with a name as great as Bacon. I figured with a name like that it's gotta be good right? I was wrong. Maybe they have the Swine flu.  My boyfriend and I went to Bacon last Sunday for breakfast. I ordered the scrambled eggs with (what else) bacon, potatoes and an english muffin. Boyfriend had french toast.  It took FOREVER to get our food. At least 2 tables who sat down after us got their food before we did. When we finally did get our food, mine was cold. The eggs were pretty good but the potatoes were cold and blah and the bacon was thin and just okay.   If you're gonna call your place Bacon you should have the best bacon ever! Not the case. Matt's Big Breakfast has much better bacon.  At the end of our meal one of the employees came over and apologized for our long wait time and presented us with coupons and invited us to come back. I was pleasantly surprised until I looked at the coupons and realized they expired at the end of April, which at the time was 4 days away! Gee, thanks Bacon!  I won't be going back.

I have been to the Ono location in North Scottsdale and I think this location could stand to take a few lessons from them as they did not measure up.  The boyfriend and I went to Ono on a Sunday afternoon eager to stuff our faces with yummy Hawaiian food and spend the Groupon I had purchased.  There was one person working the register and she was not very personable, couldn't follow what we were ordering (I ordered, then boyfriend ordered, then the counter person asked me what I was having??), and took forever to figure out how to deal with the Groupon. Then when our food came out she forgot to give us forks and napkins. They don't have any napkins out by the drinks or on tables. By this point she was putting ice in the soda machine so it took about 10 minutes into our meal before I could get a napkin. Do they have a problem with people taking too many napkins that they feel the need to hide and ration them? Weird.  Anyway, onto the food. We ordered two plate lunches and two musubi. Hands down the WORST musubi I've ever had. The seaweed was so tough we couldn't bite through it so it was just a mess. The spam was the thinnest piece I've ever seen. Awful. Save your money for something else.  The BBQ chicken was pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. The mac salad is not great, very heavy mayo. Now, I know mac salad is made with mayo and I don't expect it to be light by any means but I also don't eat mayo out of the jar either and that's what this tasted like.  Overall I was not impressed, not satisfied and I will not be going back. Ono turned this dining experience into an Oh No!

The Parlor has an excellent happy hour! They offer a very extensive menu of drinks and food on special. And they have it on Saturdays, perfect for a late lunch/early dinner kinda weekend.  The boyfriend and I ordered two pizzas and an appetizer. For the app we got the cheezy cauliflower. I know for some people cauliflower isn't very appealing but this dish was amazing. It's a small dish of cauliflower baked with gooey cheese and topped with breadcrumbs. We quickly gobbled up the whole dish. So actually by the time our pizzas came we ended up not really eating that much of them (even if they were smaller, happy hour sized). We got the pepperoni and the Yukon gold. Both were tasty and the crust was done very well. I wouldn't say the pizzas were amazing but they were very good. Honestly I'd go back for the cauliflower before the pizza.  The atmosphere is great. Obviously a lot of work went into the design of the restaurant and it shows. Make sure you check out the pictures near the bathroom - it shows what the place looked like when it was a salon. The naked lady wallpaper is fantastic!

During a home renovation I hired Marcel Painting several times. We gutted a big chunk of our house so the first time they came out it was to remove the popcorn ceilings in every room. The second time was to paint the interior. The third was to paint the exterior. Every time they were fast, clean and paid good attention to detail.    They removed the popcorn from the whole house in just 2 days and it looked great. For the interior paint we have an accent wall in the living room that is a different color than the other walls and they did a great job on the edges. They did it by hand and it looks perfect - no color bleeding or wavy lines. When it came to the exterior the job ended up being more work than we originally thought it would be (more prep) but they worked until it was done. They were very concerned with doing quality work and didn't rush even if it was more days than originally planned. They were very cautious to cover anything that shouldn't be painted and cleaned up everything afterwards.   And they are VERY affordable! I highly recommend Marcel for any painting job, big or small.

Love love love Lo-Lo's! And I love their new Scottsdale location. More for the location really, their original location has a totally different vibe. But luckily the food is the same at both places.  I always get the same thing - the Tre Tre's - two chicken legs and a waffle and of course red Kool-aid to wash down the grease. Their chicken is nice and crispy always cooked just right. Although I have heard the white meat pieces can be dry sometimes so I recommend the dark meat. Their waffles are fluffy and filling. And the sugar rush you get from the kool-aid is the perfect way to get going on a Saturday morning.  If you're really hungry the mac n cheese is a VERY good side. Nothing wrong with Mac n cheese for breakfast! And their red velvet cake is yummy too.   On Sunday they have live gospel music that is a fun, lively addition to the meal.  This place is a true valley gem and has never disappointed.

I can't quite put my finger on it but there is something about this LA Fitness I don't like. Maybe it's the lack of windows? The drab florescent lighting? The fact that everything is just kinda there, thrown together in one room? I don't know. What I do know is that it's depressing. I went on the elliptical machine once and it just made me sad. The only reason I go here is for some of the group fitness classes and because it's close to where I work. And that's only when I can't get to the Scottsdale Rd location in time.  I guess I expected more because of the location. It's a nice area and close enough to North Scottsdale that I thought it would be a little nicer just to compete with the other clubs in the area. They should just tear this location down and start over. Blech.

Was looking for a Mexican restaurant in the Ahwatukee area and was lured in by the big outdoor patio at Sandbar. I was with family visiting from out of town so I thought they'd like to sit outside and enjoy the warm weather. Unfortunately there were no open tables outside so we ended up sitting inside oh well.  The atmosphere is kinda loud and bar like which was fine. It wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other. Although the waiter had a hard time hearing us as we had to repeat ourselves several times. And he always seemed to big in a big hurry which was kinda weird.  We got chips and salsa and a couple people in our party got margaritas to start with. I was kinda bummed that the chips and salsa were $5 when they're usually free at other places if you order dinner. But the salsa was actually pretty good so it was fine.  I had the carnitas tacos and was a bit underwhelmed. Honestly the carnitas at Chipotle is better. They were fine, 3 to an order but the portions were kinda skimpy. The tortillas were fresh though. I ordered it with rice and beans. The beans were fine but the rice was pretty gross. I don't know if it was the seasoning or what but it was some of the worst mexican rice I've ever had.  The boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas and he said they were not good. He said the sauce on them was more like marinara sauce than enchilada sauce - yuck.   My cousin and her husband didn't say anything so they might have liked it or they were just being polite.  With so many other good places for Mexican here in town I don't think we'll revisit Sandbar anytime soon.

It's no secret that I love me a good cheeseburger  so I was excited to try a new place. New to me anyway :)  My first impression of the place is they could use a hand. It was kinda busy (Friday lunchtime) but there were only two people in front of me in line and it still took forever. Partly because when I finally got up to front the one guy taking orders had to stop to make shakes. Another guy finally came out after a few minutes and took my order. So they're not the fastest place in town.  But, I was happy to see their menu featured a "build your own" option. I like my burger relatively plain so I ordered the regular bun, american cheese, tomato, lettuce and mayo. I also ordered a side of the smashfries. Who could turn down fries with olive oil and rosemary? Not this girl.  The burger was juicy and tasted fresh but was a bit on the salty side. The boyfriend and friend both said theirs were not too salty so it was just mine I guess. It happens.  The fries were tasty, thin cut and came out nice and hot. Reminded me a little of McDonald's fries but with oil and rosemary. The boyfriend had the onion strings which were also a little on the salty side. Maybe the cook that day just really likes salt?  If it weren't for the over-saltiness of my burger I would have thought it was quite tasty so I'm willing to try Smashburger again. And the manager walked by several times asking how our food was. I probably should have said something but it wasn't bad enough that I didn't eat it so I can't be too hard on them.

I'm a big fan of Fox restaurants already but Modern Steak did not disappoint. The boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we had a great experience.  It was a Saturday night and I was surprised at how not busy it was. We chose a nice table out on the patio because it was a warm evening. Even though the patio is right next to the parking lot it's relatively covered so you still feel like you're in the restaurant and not just sitting in traffic.  We both ordered filet mignon. I was very happy to see the had grass-fed beef. You don't see that too often and it's a much better choice than grain-fed so yay Modern Steak for offering that! For our sides we ordered the mushrooms and the onion rings.  The steak was delish. Done just right to each of our liking ad a nice-sized portion. The onion rings were tasty, served with BBQ sauce. The mushrooms were a nice compliment to the steak. My the end of our meal we were stuffed and satisfied. When the boyfriend made reservations he mentioned it was my birthday so they brought out a free dessert. A very nice touch for sure.  The most impressive part of the night came at the end. We both had steak left over so sent it back with the server to be boxed to go. She came back to our table and told us my steak had accidentally been thrown out and offered to have a fresh steak cooked for us to take home. I was blown away that they would offer that instead of just saying oops. We of course took her up on the offer and enjoyed the leftovers the next day.  High marks for the food, service and atmosphere. Modern Steak was the perfect choice for my birthday dinner.

I am always on the prowl for a good burger so when I heard there was a new burger place in Tempe I knew I had to try it out.  The boyfriend and I went to Lobby's on a Friday night. It was not busy but the location doesn't really lend itself to busy. So we were able to walk right in and order. It's an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place. We both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share. I liked that the burgers were not pre-made frozen patties. They threw down two hunks of beef on the grill.  The burgers were tasty, a nice size - not too big, not too small - and the fixin's were fresh. So was the bun.  The fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good.  The atmosphere was fine, good for a quick sit-down and the staff was friendly.  I hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure.

It's Friday night. Friend just got a new job. Let's toast at 5th and Wine.  My friend and I love Postino to bits but decided to hit up 5th and Wine for a change of pace. So glad we did as I now have a new place to add to my list of Old Town favs.  Since it was Friday, it was pretty busy but we still got a table right away. There was a duo playing music so between that and the crowd it did get pretty noisy. Not the place for intimate dinner conversation, apparently. But we were there to celebrate so speaking loudly was not much of an issue.  We quickly ordered white sangria and settled in. The sangria was tasty and I was soon buzzing. We decided to share an order of fries and bruschetta. The fries were very good - covered in garlic and herbs and served with a creamy dipping sauce. We got 4 types of bruschetta - apples and brie, prosciutto, salmon and tomato and mozzarella. The only one I didn't care for was the salmon. The creamy sauce on there was just not my thing. But I liked all the others and there were other options on the menu so I'd just get something else next time.  The service was great. We camped out for a long time and they didn't seem to care. Even after we were done the waiter still kept bringing us water which was nice.  I looks forward to going back to try their burger. And sit on the outdoor patio once it cools off!

I love breakfast so I was happy to hear about this place. Last Sunday the boyfriend and I ventured over there after a hike at South Mountain.  The place is popular. Even though it was afternoon it was still busy. And even though it was lunchtime they were still serving breakfast - yay!  I ordered the pancakes with apple compote and bacon and boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The pancakes were huge. Two plate sizes cakes with cinnamon-y apples on top. The bacon was 4 strips and although they were thin they were good. The pancakes had a nice fluffy texture and a good flavor. The apples were just okay. They didn't detract from the cakes they just didn't really add anything either. I might go with the strawberries next time.   Boyfriend said his burger was good, not amazing but tasty. He said it was a little bland. But the fries were really good.  The atmosphere is a relaxed sophistication. It's a big airy space and the have lots of outdoor seating as well.   I will find my way back to Hillside Spot again I'm sure.

I'm confused by three things on this Yelp listing. One, the first reviewer said he has been there several times - the place has only been open a week. I guess it's possible to go several times in a week but unlikely, especially considering he does not mention any specifics. Two, the second reviewer said there is a huge menu. Maybe there will be eventually but right now it's very limited. Three, someone posted a picture of frybread. I did not see this on the menu. All these things are very suspicious. I'm just sayin'.  Anyway, some co-workers and I went to Suckerpunch Sally's for lunch. We were excited to try a new place but in the end we left rather underwhelmed. The menu is limited right now - a few breakfast options, a couple burgers and a few entrees.  None of us were blown away by the food. I got eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and a biscuit.  I will say the eggs were very good. Very creamy and tasty. The hasbrowns were a little on the greasy side but decent. The biscuit was pretty good and the bacon was average. Friend 1 got an omelet and felt it was very small. She was still hungry when we left. Friend 2 got the build your own mac and cheese. Cool concept but the portion was small and the sauce was runny. Friend 3 got a burger. The bun was gigantic and stale. The fries were tired crinkle-cut. He wished he would have gone to Five Guys instead.  Overall the food wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything that would make us want to go back. The only reason I might check it out again is to try their pie. They are going to have to really step it up if they want to stay in business.

I'm so happy that Jimmy John's has come to the Valley. They offer good sandwiches at good prices.   I have been to JJ's many times in MN and this JJ's is just as good. I went there for lunch today and the place was busy but the staff didn't seem overwhelmed. I ordered a #4 Turkey with cheese and my sandwich was in my hands very quickly. The bread was nice and soft, the ingredients tasted fresh and it had just the right amount of mayo- not too much, not too little. And the sandwiches are an ample size - 8 inches.   All together the sandwich and chips (no drink) came to just over $5. Almost a dollar less than Silver Mine subs (where I usually go). Sorry Silver Mine, I've got a new favorite sub shop.   One downside - the place is tiny. Not many places to sit, especially if you are with a group of three or more.

The newest in a line of fro-yo shops around Tempe, Aloha Yogurt offers a decent enough experience to compete with some of the more popular places.  The offer a variety of yogurt to choose from and the girl working there gave us a few sample cups to try stuff out. One quality that stood out was that their flavors actually tasted like their flavors. The snickerdoodle tasted like snicherdoodle, the chocolate malt tasted like malt.( the snozberries tasted like snozberries!) At some of the other yogurt places (Yogurtland) all the flavors taste the same. They offer pretty much the same toppings as most other places, maybe a few less. Less sauces for sure - only chocolate and caramel. But I got my mochi and cheesecake so I was satisfied.  They completely missed the mark on the style of the shop however. The really bad mural on the wall does nothing for them. And they don't have tables but instead a couple couches. So if you're looking at atmosphere in your yogurt-going adventures you won't find it here. But if you're just looking for a cup of yogurt in your neighborhood (and you live around there) Aloha Yogurt is a good option.

Having been satisfied by other Fox restaurants I was excited to hear about the opening of Culinary Dropout. So this Saturday the boyfriend and I were in Old Town and decided to check it out for dinner.  Upon walking in we were greeting promptly and sat right away (it was early). But then we sat for quite a while before anyone came over to our table. I was starting to get nervous. But our waiter finally came by and was more than attentive from that point forward.  We skipped any appetizers, but did stare longingly at the pretzel bites the table next to us ordered. Maybe next time. I ordered the Pub burger and the boyfriend ordered the gnocchi. I was glad that my burger came with fries. This was not stated on the menu anywhere which I thought was kinda weird. But whatever, yay fries!  Our food came out really fast considering they were starting to get pretty busy. My burger was cooked just right and had a nice flavor. The bacon was nice and thick, not that cheapo paper-thin bacon you get at some places. I was kinda hoping it was going to be as good as the burgers at Zinburger in Tucson (another Fox place) but it wasn't quite as tasty. Close though. The portion of fries was large. They were thin cut and were nice and crispy. The boyfriend enjoyed his gnocchi. It came with sausage and was served in a cream sauce. I had a bite and thought it was quite flavorful. Not a huge portion but gnocchi can be pretty filling so it wasn't bad.  Even though we were pretty full the waiter talked us into ordering the monkey bread for dessert. It's served in a small cast iron dish and is sort of like a cut-up cinnamon roll with apples. It came to our table bubbling hot and served with a dish of vanilla ice cream on the side. It was very rich but the apples were a nice consistency and overall the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The ice cream helped cool it down and complimented the flavors well.  I can kinda see the bar filling up with some Scottsdale douche-bags at night but at least the staff wasn't pretentious. By the time we left the lobby area was getting pretty full so I imagine if you go after 7:00pm you'll have to wait for a table. It's worth checking out though so if you're not starving, wait.

If you're looking for the Roberto's that was on Diners Drive-ins and Dives you have to go to Anthem. The owners moved up there. This place is not the same.

Nobody wants to shop for tile. But if you want a pretty new bathroom, tile shopping has to happen at some point. My boyfriend and I went to Floor & D√©cor twice, once to pick out tile, and another time to buy it. This review is for our second visit. We went in hoping to get enough boxes of tile to cover the two showers we are doing. There weren't enough boxes on the floor so we loaded up what was there and headed to the register figuring they could just check another store or order more.   The first thing the cashier says is "these are different dye lots." Say what, now? Dye lots? I figured if it says pure snow tile, I'm getting all the same tile. Apparently that is not always the case. I'm SO glad she said something because we had no idea that was a thing. She called one of the designers over to help us out. The designer called the store on Camelback and they were a few boxes short of what we needed. So she ended up ordering them in a shipment instead and included a note to check the dye lot so we would be sure to get matching tiles throughout. This whole process took quite a bit of time but she was nice through it all. We placed our order and went home.   Then, we talked to our contractor and realized what we ordered could potentially leave us short and we needed a few more boxes. So we went back to the store and luckily they were able to easily add a few boxes to our order.  I really appreciate that the cashier brought the dye lot issue to our attention and I also really appreciate how they took the time to get us exactly what we needed. A home remodel is very stressful so every bit of help goes a long way.   UPDATE: It did take longer than they said to get the tile. They quoted a week, but it took two and a half. So make sure you allow plenty of time to get your tile!

I've been going to Dr. Falcon for a few years now and I have to say she's just great. I have worn contacts for decades but when I moved to Arizona I had the hardest time finding an eye doctor that could find contacts that would work for me. I had one doctor actually give up on me after trying several different pairs - I still couldn't see and he sent me packing!  Luckily I finally found Dr. Falcon. She really takes the time to talk to you, always does a thorough exam and is willing to do what it takes to get you the perfect fit. Plus, you can tell she really enjoys what she does and is very knowledgeable about eyes and eye care - which really makes a difference in my book. Her office staff is always friendly and helpful as well. Even though I only go in once a year they always remember me and give me personal service.   I have recommended Dr. Falcon to several people and continue to do so. You can't go wrong with her, particularly if you have hard-to-fit contacts.

Never having been to El Chorro before I was excited when my work announced that we would be having our holiday party there this year. It turned out to be a great choice.  We are a decent sized company so we had a room to ourselves in the back of the property. It looked like it was a room that could be used for wedding receptions or any other kind of party. There were several large round tables set up and a full bar in the back. There was an outdoor area too but it was night and kinda chilly so everyone stayed inside for the most part. Another plus was that there was plenty of parking. It's not always easy to find ample parking for a group of 100+.  The evening started with passed hors d'oeuvres that were delish - prosciutto-wrapped scallops, crab-cakes and an onion tartlette of some kind. Whatever it was it tasted good! The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our group.  For dinner I had the shortribs which came with a side of beans and potatoes. It was really good. The meat was extremely tender (melt-in-your-mouth-type), cooked to perfection and juicy and flavorful. Shortribs are not a lean cut of beef but it was worth it. I enjoyed every bite.  One person at our table got a very tough tough piece of fish and they had no problem replacing her meal as quickly as possible without hassle.   Overall, we had a very nice time, the food was great and the staff friendly. I'd highly recommend El Chorro for a corporate party or reception.

Hit RnR for lunch with some co-workers this week. The atmosphere is very open and modern but not uptight which is always nice. It was not very busy so the 6 of us got a table right away.  The menu had a nice selection of salads and sandwiches, pretty much your standard fare for lunch. I ordered a salad that included strawberries, apples, walnuts and a strawberry dressing on mixed greens. I added chicken for $3 more.  The salad was a decent size and there was a lot of chicken which was great. I hate when places make you pay extra for a piddly scrap of food. The chicken was done well and the salad was fresh. Most of my co-workers had chicken sandwiches which they gobbled up quickly.  The service was pretty quick but our waitress was a little snotty. When one of my co-workers got his sandwich with mayo (which was not mentioned on the menu) and asked for a new bun, the waitress did get him another sandwich quickly but also had to point out (with attitude) that it was aioli not mayo. Umm...isn't aioli just a fancy word for mayo mixed with something? And why would you put mayo, ahem, aioli on a sandwich that had pesto? Whatever.   I would be willing to visit RnR again and try one of their sandwiches or burgers. But hopefully I'll get a different waitress.

If you're like me, when you hear the word ramen you think about the packages of dried noodles with the flavor pack that you get at the grocery store five for a dollar. So walking into a restaurant that specializes in ramen, I didn't really know what to expect.  Luckily, the guy working behind the counter was nice enough to walk me through the various ramen options so I knew just what I was getting myself into.  This ramen is like the store bought stuff on steroids. First of all - they give you a ton! I couldn't even get through half of it. Secondly, it includes something the store stuff lacks - fresh ingredients. Mixed in with the noodles was spinach, carrots and I chose pork as my meat. The broth was flavorful and the noodles has a nice flavor and consistency. I would have liked more pork though. The meat to noodle ratio was a bit unbalanced.  I think this place is a good alternative to other asian restaurants and would make a great option for a quick and filling lunch.

I'm not a big pedicure gal but it was my friend's birthday so I was willing to go along with her as she wanted one.  We went in on a Saturday afternoon and the place was hopping! Good thing we had made an appointment. We both chose the $30 pedicure package. The woman who worked on my feet did an amazing job scrubbing and rubbing my tootsies and calves. It felt great and the scrubs and lotions didn't smell awful like they do at some places. I chose a nice pink color for my polish and for $5 extra I got a flower design on my big toes - complete with one little crystal on each. Very cute.  It's been a couple weeks now and my polish has not chipped at all. The crystals have even stayed on and I've worn tennis shoes to go running several times.  This place may just get me hooked on pedicures after all.

Sweeties isn't a candy store, it's a candy warehouse. Pretty much any kind of candy you're looking for they have it - even some "vintage" candy. Gummies? Yes. Chocolate bars? Of course. Candy cigarettes? No problem. Suckers with scorpions inside? They have those too.   The boyfriend and I went there looking for a chocolate orange but walked out with a ton of candy we couldn't resist - a load of gummies, gum, chocolate, nougat jellies - my sweet tooth was overloaded with excitement.  This would be a great place if you had to buy candy in bulk as it seemed much cheaper than most candy stores. Plus it's family owned and it's always good to go local!

If you're looking for a tasty alternative to the big sandwich chains, this is it. Their sandwiches are big, fresh and super yummy. Last time I was in I got the chicken club with avocado - tons of chicken, bacon and of course, avocado piled on their fresher than fresh bread. Seriously their bread is so soft, it's like bread candy. All in all it was a filling sandwich that really hit the spot on a Saturday afternoon.

Tiny restaurant, big potential.  The boyfriend and I decided to use my Groupon for lunch on Saturday and we couldn't have made a better choice. Centurion has a laid back atmosphere perfect for sitting outside and having a leisurely lunch. When we got there, there was only one other table sat so luckily we were able to grab a spot in the shade. They have a nice big canopy over their patio to help cut down on the direct sun. The inside looked cute (tiny, but cute) but outside was the place to be.  We started off with the baked brie. It comes wrapped in a pastry shell with jam inside and grapes on the side. Warm, gooey brie with jam? How could you go wrong? I ordered the shrimp and crab sandwich and boyfriend went for the tenderloin sandwich. Both came with salad on the side.  My sandwich was really good. The bread was fresh and it was loaded with shrimp and crab. I ordered it without dijon and it did feel like it could have used something else on it. But overall I liked it. Boyfriend felt the same way about his sandwich - good but needed a little something to make it great.  The side salad was very good. it was spinach with blackberries and a blackberry dressing. Simple but good. But then again I'm a big fan of spinach, too.  i could see this place becoming quite the hot spot. Like I said, big potential. I think if they fine tuned a few things it could be really, really good. I recommend checking it out now before you have to wait for hours to get a table.

Maui wowee! This place rocks.  Thanks to a few trips to the islands, I'm a major hawaiian food junkie. A plate lunch makes me a happy girl. And while Maui Dog goes island style in a different way it's totally ono!  There is a place in Hawaii called Puka Dog. Maui Dog is like it's Arizona cousin. The taste was almost exactly the same. You pick what kind of dog you want, what kind of garlic mayo and your fruit relish. It sounds kinda gross but it's fantastic! The combo just works somehow.  I got a regular hot dog with mild garlic mayo and mango. So, so good. The mayo still had a bit of kick to it even though it was mild and the fruit relish was sweet and tasty. The perfect balance. The dog itself was huge and had a good beefy flavor. And the bun was nice and fresh which can really make or break a hot dog. They also serve tots and fries. Awesome!  I can't wait to get back and get another maui dog, this time with multiple fruits. I might even have to get a spam slider.  Mahalo, Maui Dog!!

I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut. The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home. I was also super scared for my waistband.  Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley. Not that there is a ton of competition but still. They're really good. They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed, filled to fritters. My favorite is the glazed twist. So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it. Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.  I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up. Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?  I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.

I loved my dinner at Otto! My friend and I were enjoying a girl's weekend in Vegas and stopped into Otto for dinner. We had a great table facing the entertainment in the "square." Our waiter was really friendly and walked us through his recommendations for the menu. We decided to start with the fried ricotta and then share a prosciutto pizza and carbonara pasta.  The fried ricotta was delish - it's basically little cheese balls with a little bit of spice. Yum. The pizza was really good - tons of fresh prosciutto and the crust was done just right. The carbonara pasta was pretty heavy and had an odd but good taste if that makes sense. I think a really stinky cheese was used. I don't know if I would have liked it as just a single entr√©e because it was so rich but it was a great combo with the pizza. Our waiter recommended a white wine that also complimented the flavors perfectly so overall it was a well put together meal.  I love how Mario Batali's restaurants are casual and yet the food is top notch. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!

$20/person? The money goes to charity and in return you get to gorge yourself on cupcakes? Mmmmm....let me think....yes!  Went to the Cupcake Love-In for the first time this year and enjoyed every sugary bite.  Two rooms full of different cupcake vendors, eager to serve you a sample of their sweet treats. I have no idea how many cupcakes I actually ate. I lost count after room 1.   The best cupcakes were the unusual ones. Sure there were great vanilla and chocolate but if you can put prosciutto and fig into a cupcake and make it work, you're the winner in my book (looking at you Bourbon Steak).  The only bummer was that a lot of places ran out really early! Event started at 11:00 and by 11:30 places were already out of some things. So we missed getting to try a few that sounded interesting. One place had one with avocado but they were out by the time I got there. :( The event was scheduled to go until 2. I feel bad for anyone that came after noon, really.  But a good venue, great cupcakes and a good cause. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday.

I will admit I didn't have the highest of expectations for Canteen as Mill Ave has disappointed before. What I did have was a Groupon so on Friday night the boyfriend and I decided to cash it in.   Walking in I was surprised at how nice the place was. And the hostesses were friendly too. My expectations began to change. There was a wait since it was Friday but once we were seated we got a great booth and settled in. The atmosphere is great for date night.   I ordered a hibiscus margarita and the pork chop and boyfriend ordered chicken tacos and onion rings. The margarita was delish - which if you're gonna call yourself a tequila bar, it better be good. They delivered. The pork chop was amazing. It was seasoned perfectly and nice and juicy. It was served on a cheesy, slightly spicy rice that complimented it perfectly. Boyfriend really liked his tacos and the dip that comes with the onion rings is awesome. We were stuffed but had to try the rice pudding anyway. It was also tasty - creamy and cinnamon-y served with mini sopapillas. A nice wrap up to the meal.  And throughout the night the staff was great. My water glass was always full, our waiter checked back with us several times and the service was quick with everything. Other restaurants could use a lesson from the Canteen staff on how to treat customers. We felt comfortable and taken care of all night.  My expectation were far surpassed. I can't wait to go back to Canteen. Even without a Groupon the food and drinks are worth it. Great place!

Sofrita was fantastic. The boyfriend and I were enjoying a little staycation at a resort nearby and wanted something good for dinner. We were not disappointed here. It was a Saturday night, and a little later (for Fountain Hills, anyway) so we got a table no problem. So many things looked good on the menu but we decided to start with the garbanzos fritos and share the pot roast tacos and a bruschetta board.  The garbanzos came out in a bowl and there was more than enough for the two of us. Overall the servings here were pretty big. They were crispy and crunchy. We didn't know if you were supposed to eat them like chips or with a fork so we did a little of both! Regardless of eating style, I loved them so much I kinda want to figure out how to make them at home now.  Next came the pot roast tacos and the bruschetta. First the tacos. We were expecting a few little tacos - you know, meat in a tortilla? So when they brought out a big bowl of basically pot roast stew with a few tortillas on the side we were pretty surprised. But we dug in and just ate the meat and veggies as is, occasionally using the tortillas more like dipping bread. So like the garbanzos I don't know if we ate it "right" but it was delicious regardless.  Then there was the bruschetta. This I knew how to eat - haha! They do not skimp on toppings on these things. We got one with dates and cream cheese - loaded with dates. So good. The artichoke one was really tasty too.  It was all tasty. I honestly enjoyed everything we tried. We don't go to Fountain Hills very often (like pretty much never) but that may change now that we found Sofrita. It'd be worth the drive from the south end of town.

The boyfriend took me to the House at Secret Garden for my birthday and I could not have asked for a nicer place to celebrate.  He made a reservation so we got a great table outside, right by the fireplace. The setting was really pretty with lots of trees and lights.  I started by ordering a cactus fig margarita. No joke, I think this was the best margarita I've ever had. It was the perfect combo of salty and sweet. It was really delicious. I had to resist not guzzling many of them as it would have been way too easy to do.  For an appetizer we decided to get a cheese plate. We got 4 types of cheese and it came with almonds, figs, craisins, raisins and toast points. Four cheeses was a lot for the two of us - three would have been sufficient. But hey, it was my birthday. They gave us plenty of time to enjoy the cheese plate. We did not feel rushed at all, which was very nice.  For our entrees I went with the catch of the day - salmon and boyfriend chose the New York Strip. The salmon was melt-in-your-mouth good. It was paired with a cauliflower sauce and braised greens and the combination of flavors was just perfect. Boyfriend's steak was done just the way he liked it and had a good flavor to it. It was not a very traditional steak as it was served with a spicy sauce and came with lots of peppers.  For desert we got the bread pudding and the cannoli. Like everything else the bread pudding was outstanding. I was kinda disappointed by the cannoli though. The shell was pretty airy and the filling was chocolaty instead of traditional vanilla. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. Next time I'd order the bread pudding again but skip the cannoli.  The House at Secret Garden was the perfect choice for my birthday. I highly recommend it for a special occasion or romantic date night.

With a name like Spotted Donkey I was expecting this to be the kind of place where they offer $2 Coronas and Taco Tuesdays. So I was surprised when I walked in to discover that this was actually a nice, sit-down restaurant - like the kind of place you might take a date. (Not that cheap tacos and beer can't make a great date, but you know I'm sayin')  Some co-workers and I were working late in the area so we decided to try it out. I would describe their menu as traditional Mexican food with a twist. To start we ordered a quesadilla with pork to share. It was outstanding! First, it was huge. Second it was loaded with pork - they did not skimp. Third, it was delicious. The pork was nice and tender and drizzled on top there was a garlicky sour cream that really made this entr√©e great.  For our meals, I ordered the tacos (2 beef, 2 shrimp), co-worker 1 ordered the burger, co-worker 2 ordered the chopped salad. The tacos are like street tacos - small corn tortillas. I really liked the shrimp  - had a good little kick. The beef were good too but the shrimp was better. My co-workers gobbled up their choices as well. The one with the salad said it was one of the best salads she has ever had.  Overall, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice and the food was very tasty. I would go back for sure.

Sooooooo good!  I have been to True Food twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner and both meals were excellent.   The dinner was the standout for sure. The boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. It's a popular place so we expected to wait (and we did).  When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server, I think his name was John, who was great from beginning to end.   I ordered the teriyaki bowl with chicken and boyfriend ordered the bison burger. I loved my rice bowl. It was loaded with broccoli, snap peas, green beans and chicken. It also had avocado on top which was surprisingly a great addition to the dish. I enjoyed every bite of this dish.  Boyfriend enjoyed his bison burger but it could have used a little more cheese. They serve sweet potato hash instead of fries which is very good as well.  For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. Small but rich. Very fudgy and yummy.  I can't wait to try more dishes at True Food. Open a location in Tempe, please!!!

Tasty Thai is in fact, tasty. The boyfriend and I hit Tasty Thai for a late dinner on a Saturday night. Maybe it's just because it was late but we were the only people in the place for most of the time we were there. Which is too bad because their food is actually really good.  I ordered the broccoli beef and boyfriend ordered fried rice. I ordered mine no spice and boyfriend went for medium. Even with no spice my dish was still full of flavor. The brown sauce was quite yummy and the portion was big enough that I had leftovers. Boyfriend's medium spice fried rice was too spicy for me but he enjoyed it. His nose was running a little though so it definitely had a kick!  The atmosphere was fine. There was a bit of an odd odor though, can't quite place what it was. I might just do take out next time.

One of the better breakfasts I've had in a while.  Went to Perk with some friends on a Sunday morning. We arrived around 9AM so I was not surprised that there was a wait. I don't mind waiting for a good breakfast but what I do mind is when they tell you it's going to be 10 minutes and it's really like 30. Always overestimate your wait times, people!  Anyway, onto the food. I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with slow roasted pork. It also included their rosemary potatoes and toast. OMG the pork was delicious!! It was nice and juicy and very flavorful. It came with a sauce but it was good just by itself. I wouldn't have really thought of this type of meat for breakfast but with the eggs and potatoes it was the perfect combination. The potatoes were really good too. I like my potatoes a little more "done" so I thought they were great although I could see how someone could consider them overcooked.  The portions were quite large and I thought the prices were fair. For five of us the bill came to around $60 and that included tip. Not bad in my opinion.  It was a little loud for conversation but to be expected at a diner on Sunday morning.   It would be great if they opened a location on the south end of town, hint hint!!

It seems like there aren't a ton of great restaurants in this section of town (I could be wrong!) but I was pleasantly surprised when our friends took us to breakfast here. It's a super cute coffee shop and caf√© by day and wine bar and restaurant by night. Or I guess by afternoon.  Their breakfast menu isn't huge but good if you're looking for a simple, smaller meal. We all opted for the breakfast burrito. (we each got our own, of course - haha) It was a decent size - not Chipotle-size but big enough for a meal. The tortilla was nice and soft and it was full of eggs, bacon and potatoes. On the side was a green sauce that added a nice little kick without being overwhelming. I thought it was very tasty and everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.  The place isn't very big, they do have a patio but in the summer that might be pretty hot. But it's got a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I would love to go back to try one of their lunch or dinner options.

Tried out Hey Joe at the Wednesday night food truck gathering downtown. I ordered the lumpia (eggrolls) and devoured everything in the little white tray. The order of three eggrolls came with rice and some kind of pickled carrots or something. I don't actually know what it was I just know that I liked it! The cool slaw was a nice contrast to the (very) hot eggrolls. Hint - resist the urge to just dig in. Let them cool off before you bite in or you'll burn your tongue.  The lumpia was crunchy, greasy and yummy - just the way an eggroll should be.   It's a little pricey, but it's a food truck so it's quality food and I;m okay paying a little more for better quality.   I would totally go back and try some of the other items.

I think people are being a little harsh on this place. I thought it was pretty good. After reading the reviews my expectations were low but my Groupon addiction had gotten the better of me and I had to spend the Groupon I bought a few months back. Boyfriend and I headed in on a Sunday night. The place is huge and it was kind of empty so seating was not an issue.   We ordered BBQ wings and a sausage pizza. Seeing as it wasn't that busy we started to wonder when we didn't get our wings. Then we got our pizza. Hmm. So I said "we had wings too." The waiter went back to check and we got or wings in just a few minutes. We didn't complain (they didn't come out that late, really) but they offered to take half off the wings for the mix-up. Nice service!  The pizza had a nice chewy crust, not too much sauce and a decent amount of cheese. If you like lots of sauce you may want to request extra. The crust was kind of buttery and reminded me of the crazy bread at Little Caesars - yum! The wings were a little on the small side but had a good flavor to them.  So while I can't say it was the best pizza ever it was good enough that I'd eat it again for sure.

I love a good burger. I especially love a good grass-fed beef burger. Since most places do not serve grass-fed beef I was excited to discover Coal Burger. if you don't know, grass-fed beef is healthier than grain-fed, for you and the cows!  Upon my first visit, they did not disappoint. The boyfriend and I went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't very busy so we hopped right up to the counter and ordered - 2 burgers and an order of fries/half sweet potato.   Our food came out quickly and was nice and hot. I've never had a coal oven baked burger before but it tasted a lot like a grilled burger like you'd have at a cookout (coal - duh, it took me a second to make the connection). Some reviewers have said the burgers were overcooked. I would not agree. My burger was done just right, not dry at all. The bun was also nice and fresh - an important component to a good burger in my book. And the best part was that there was lots of cheese!  The fries were solid. A little too salty but good overall.   I'm very happy to see that they are opening a location in Chandler soon. I will visit them for sure! Can't wait to enjoy yummy grass-fed burgers again.

Mood Swings is the perfect name for this place because I seem to have a different experience every time I go here. I used to enjoy going here but unfortunately the last couple of times the mood has not been positive.   I bought a Groupon for a haircut, deep conditioning treatment and a style. The person I made the appointment with over the phone was friendly and helpful. The stylist was a dud. I don't know if it was because I had a Groupon but she did not give two hoots about being friendly. In fact, she barely spoke to me at all, making my time in the chair rather uncomfortable. I don't need someone super chatty but she didn't even try to strike up a conversation.  To start, the consultation was brief at best. She didn't really seem to care about hat I wanted and she offered no opinions or recommendations. Then we moved to the shampoo station. I assumed I would get the conditioning treatment at this point but from what I could tell I just got the standard shampoo and conditioner - nothing seemed different from my pervious visits. Then when we got back to the chair I don't know that she said two words to me until near the end when she tried to sell me on product. When she was done my haircut was so minimal I could barely tell that she even did anything. I looked pretty much the same as when I walked in there.    When I was leaving I asked if they validated parking in the pay lot a block away and they said they only validate for services over $100. Seriously? That seems a little stingy to me.  Needless to say I've had enough of their mood swings and I will not be returning.

Three days after my visit to Churn and I am still thinking about their chocolate cookie. OMG!   The boyfriend and I went to Churn after dinner at Federal Pizza (which is also awesome, btw). The kids working behind the counter were so friendly and fun. It seems like a great place to work! After a few sample bites I decided to get a scoop of peanut butter in a pretzel cone and boyfriend got a scoop of strawberry with a chocolate cookie and toasted fluff on top.   The ice cream was so creamy and yummy. The pretzel cone went well with the PB but it was pretty thick and in turn very filling. Not sure I'd go pretzel again but it was definitely worth trying once.  I was just sitting there thoroughly enjoying my ice cream when boyfriend offered a bite of his. That's when I had the cookie. Seriously one of the best cookies anywhere. The chocolate combined with the ice cream, combined with the fluff. Holy crap. SO GOOD. Why we didn't buy more cookies to go I don't know. Big mistake.   I'm already planning my next order - chocolate cookie with vanilla and caramel on top? Or maybe chocolate cookie with peanut butter and fluff? Or maybe just 5 cookies? I dunno. I just know I can't wait to have more.

It's places like this that give meaning to the term 'hidden gem.' You can barely see the sign for Sombrero's from the street - probably why I've passed it a million times and never really noticed it. Luckily for me it came up on Yelp when I was looking to satisfy my craving for Mexican!  I stopped in around dinnertime. It wasn't very busy so I was able to just walk right up to the counter. The women working were very friendly and more than willing to walking through the different meat options.  I got a burrito bowl with carnitas. Like Chipotle, they let you choose what you want in your bowl. I was a little worried t first because the carnitas looked like they might be spicy (they were in a red sauce). But actually they were not hot, just very flavorful. The meat was really tasty, the other ingredients tasted fresh and the bowl came with a small side of chips which were perfect for scooping up my bowl ingredients. I can see why their nachos are so popular. Something about their chips make them great with toppings.  This place is the real deal. Good portions and good prices. Plus they have awesome murals on the wall. I only wish they hadn't run out of churros! Oh well, there's always next time!

Decided to give Stand Up Live a second chance after getting free tickets and reserved seating for a show. Overall it was a MUCH better experience than the first time.  1. We went to the early show instead of the late. No waiting outside in the heat, and the show started on time. I highly recommend the early show if you can 2. We were seated in a high top in the back. We could sit next to each other instead of across and it wasn't so crowded. Much more comfortable! I'm not sure how you get these seats normally (we were comped) but I would ask, they're way better than the long tables up front. 3. The service was much better. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Food and drinks were served quickly. 4. We had food. Last time it was so late we weren't hungry so we didn't order food. This time we thoughts we'd eat and ordered expecting greasy, mediocre bar food. We got appetizers (chicken wings, pretzel rolls and fries) but it was actually really good. We were surprised.   So I'm glad we gave it another try. I would not hesitate to return.

Who doesn't love a candy store? Personally, my favorite thing at a candy store are the gummies. While it'sugar had the usual offerings for the most part there were a few standouts.  Jumbo candy. The biggest gummy worm I've ever seen. Would be awesome at a party. fruit flavored gummy bears - separated by flavor chocolate covered gummy bears - sounds gross but they are amazing!   I loaded up a bag with a bunch of gummy goodness - worms, bears, cherries, peach penguins, coke bottles, sugar rings - at set out on my sugar overload. All the candy tasted fresh (no hard gummies) and the variety was good.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but it was a fun stop for sure.

I went to the Scottsdale location a while back and had one of the worst pizzas ever. I was reluctant to try Grimaldi's again but I'm glad I did. Maybe this location has better chefs?   The boyfriend and I went to satisfy our pizza cravings on a Saturday night. When we arrived we noticed there were several tables open on the patio. So when we walked in we asked the hostess to seat us out side. We were rudely told there no tables available. The other hostess even asked about a certain table and hostess number one told her it was reserved. Okay then. I understand if there aren't tables open but the condescending tone was not needed. So we sat inside.  The waitress was nice, luckily, and we ordered a caesar salad and a sausage and ricotta pizza. The salad was good, nothing exceptional but good. The pizza however was delicious. A million times better than in Scottsdale. The crust was nice and crispy, the sausage had good flavor and it had lots of big dollops of ricotta. I kept eating even when I was full because it was so tasty.   I would not hesitate to go back. Hopefully the hostess will be in a better mood next time.

Living in Arizona for several years, I have been to a fair amount of taco shops. But I have never been to one like this. The moment my boyfriend and I walked in the door we knew we were in for something unique.  We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.  The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while.   Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had.   Next time I find myself in Vegas this will be at the top of my to-do list.

The Royale is one of those places you want to root for. The little guy who is a bit on the edge, a bit quirky and rough around the edges. I just hope there is enough of an audience to allow this place to survive.  Like a few other Yelpers, my boyfriend and I ended up at the Royale after a Yelp event and were shown Dale and Tucker Vs. Evil. This was just the kind of movie you want to see in a place like this - independent, funny ad weird. The type of movie you'd never hear about otherwise. They had some great movie choices on the upcoming calendar as well.  The theater itself is pretty small. If they had a popular movie it would sell out fast. The seating was a little odd - the seats were raised on a platform that they obviously built themselves. I was a little afraid I was going to fall off the back but of course the seats were bolted down so I was okay :) They offer sodas and some candy and microwave popcorn - no popcorn machine. Maybe someday??  You could tell the people who worked there enjoyed it which always helps make an experience better. I'd like to see Rocky Horror here one weekend. It seems like it would be a great place for it.

I usually don't review large national chains but I'm making an exception here because I hope they can take it as constructive criticism.   I'm a big fan of Chipotle. I eat there for lunch a few times a month and I always get the same thing - a carnitas burrito bowl. I've been to this location a couple times now hoping that it will get better but it just doesn't. Here's why: 1. The wait. most Chipotle's are busy. But most of them know how to move the line fast. Not this one. On my first visit a woman complained because it took so long to get from the meat to the salsa because they were so busy fixing a large messed up order that her meat would be cold. On my most recent visit I stood in line for over 15 minutes and the line wasn't out the door. It was the longest I've ever been in line at a Chipotle. 2. The food. I know chain restaurants have a certain way of doing things but I don't think the people working here were trained properly because the food is always overdone or they are scraping the bottom of the containers and I get scraps. On my last visit the rice was super overcooked and the carnitas were overshredded little bits of meat. It was not good. 3. The food line. It's a mess. Every time I've gone in there is food everywhere. Not clean at all and pretty unappetizing. Ick.  C'mon guys, I know you can do better than this! But until you do, I'll be going to the other Chipotle down the road.

The boyfriend took me to Dominick's for my birthday and I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate.  We went on a weekday and were seated downstairs overlooking the bar area. Upstairs there is a pool (weird but awesome!) and if we ever go back on a weekend I definitely want to sit poolside - ha! Anyway, our table was very nice and our waiter was attentive without being overbearing.  To start we ordered the wedge salad. This may be a salad but there is nothing healthy about it. Very traditional in its preparation - iceberg lettuce, bleu cheese dressing, bacon and onion. It was a little heavy on the dressing but it had a nice flavor. We split one salad and it was plenty.  For our entrees we both ordered filets. For our sides we got mushrooms and the steakhouse tater tots. More on the tots in a sec. The steaks come out on a sizzling hot plate, so no worries of your food getting cold. Both of our steaks were done just the way we ordered. The mushrooms were a great complement to the steak. A little salty, but I kind a like salty so it was okay. Okay, now the tots. These re NOT your typical frozen tater tots. These things were fantastic. They are made by hand and it's basically like they take hashbrowns, form them into oversized tots and deep fry them. Oh my tot, are these things good. A highlight of the meal for sure!  As if we weren't stuffed enough after all the tots and meat, because it was my birthday they brought me a slice of chocolate creme pie. Sounds like a weird thing to get at a steakhouse but it actually went with the meal quite nicely. My favorite part was that they brought an extra bowl of whipped cream out with the pie. No skimping on the whipped cream at this place.  After all that we left with full bellies, smiling faces and a bag of leftovers. (yay!) I would highly recommend Dominick's for a special occasion or when you just feel like blowing a lot of money on a really good meal.

I'll admit I'm a sucker for places that serve local, organic food. But Herb'n Flavors was pretty darn good.  We arrived at 8:30pm and they close at 9:00pm so I was a little nervous that they were going to try and rush us or be rude and they were actually very welcoming and we didn't feel rushed at all which was nice.  I don't know why people are complaining about the prices. For the portions you get and the quality of food I think the prices are fair.   Anyway, onto the food. The menu is quite extensive. Pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, salad, entrees - a good variety. I ordered off the specials menu - gluten-free chicken tenders and fries. The gluten-free breading was actually really good. I was a little nervous when the food first arrived because I thought the strips looked kinda dry but they weren't. It's just that they weren't as greasy as most places! The came with a really yummy spinach and artichoke dip for, well, dipping. It was a notch up from ranch dressing for sure. The fries were like steak fries (big, thick cut) which aren't my favorite but overall they were good. Again, not as greasy as fries elsewhere.  The decor is okay - all (or at least mostly) IKEA. But it works.  It's a local business worth supporting for sure. I would go back.

I had family in town and needed a place for dinner where everyone would be able to find something they liked. I looked at the menu online and figured with the variety of sandwiches, salads, pizzas and entrees this would be a safe bet. Luckily I was right.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect. The atmosphere was nice. Nice lighting, comfortable tables and we were right by a big firepit that was pretty cool. Even though it's at a "mall" it didn't feel like it.  A couple of us ordered salads and a couple ordered fish and chips. I got the chicken waldorf salad which was huge. All the portions were huge, actually. The lettuce was crisp, the dressing wasn't too overpowering and there were big chunks of chicken, apples and walnuts. I could have easily done with a half order - they should consider that. :) My family members really enjoyed their entrees as well. My aunt cleared her plate of fish and chips!  Overall it was a great choice. If you're looking for solid "American" food that is a step up from greasy bar food this is a good option.

I visited O.H.S.O for the first time on Sunday, meeting some friends for brunch. We sat outside on the patio. They have lots of umbrellas available so there is plenty of shade.  Their brunch menu is not huge but they have a list of items all for $10 and it includes a beer or a mimosa so not a bad deal. I ordered the breakfast pizza which was a flatbread with eggs, cheese, chorizo and arugula. The portion was large - I ended up bringing half of it home with me. The mimosa was a good size too - it was served in a wine glass, not just a skimpy champagne flute.  The breakfast pizza had a really great flavor and was a nice lighter breakfast, even with the chorizo - I didn't feel weighed down afterwards. I tried a bite of my friend's French toast, too. It was good but really sweet. I was glad I had the pizza.  The wait staff was friendly but not super attentive. My friend had to ask three times to get a refill on her water.   But other than that, everything was great and I would definitely go back.

Phoenix is seriously lacking when it comes to options for pie. Thank goodness Mamma Toledo has stepped in to fill that, ahem, piehole.  I got to experience of of her pielicious concoctions at the Wednesday night food truck gathering downtown. I'll admit I was kinda hoping for a fruit pie but it's all creme pies. I however am not going to turn down pie so I can make a creme pie work!   The boyfriend and I shared a chocolate creme. Yum. Yum. Yum. For $5 you get a mini pie that was certainly big enough to share (at least after stuffing our faces at other food trucks). The filling was rich and chocolatly, the whipped topping held up in the heat and the crust was really good too. The crust can make or break a pie and I thought her's was flavorful, flaky and just the right thickness.  The only bad thing was that she gave us two really wimpy spoons. It was hard to cut through the crust because the spoons would bend under the pressure. Mamma Toledo - get some heartier spoons, or forks even, and it'll be perfect!

I was so excited to see that Dottie's was opening a location here in AZ. The boyfriend and I went to the original in San Francisco and loved it so we had high hopes for this version.  We went on a Saturday morning and got seated right away. We chose to sit outside but there were lots of tables inside as well. It is much bigger than their SF counterpart. The vibe is very different as well. SF was, well, more San Francisco. More eclectic and hectic. The atmosphere here was very laid back and overall the clientele seemed older but it may have just been that day.  We both ordered pancakes. I got mine with fruit and he got the blueberry cornmeal. The servings here are huge. my pancakes were very dense and filling. Not light and fluffy but very flavorful. They had almost a light cinnamon quality. Boyfriend loved his pancakes. So much so he tried to recreate them at home the next day. But the best part of the meal was the bacon. It tasted like it was barbecued if that even makes sense. It had a smoky flavor to it that was very unique and very delicious. It's not often you get something different with your bacon!  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable. I hope they make it in this location - it seems like a lot of businesses have failed in this spot. Go there now to make sure they last!!

I love me some food truck fare and Q Up Barbeque did not disappoint! They were one of four food trucks waiting to feed hungry runners at the end of a race downtown Phx and once we saw BBQ shrimp tacos on the menu we knew which line to stand in for our post-race pigout.  We ordered the shrimp tacos (of course) and the shredded pork nachos. Both were outstanding. The shrimp was in a spicy BBq sauce and topped with a sweet, cool slaw that was a nice contrast to the hot sauce. The tortillas were nice and fresh.  The nachos were huge and exceptionally good. The chips were made from actual tortillas, not just some Tostitos chips out of a bag. The portion of shredded pork was plentiful and the nacho cheese sauce was actually a nice touch. You'd think it would make then funky but it totally worked. Grab a fork though, these nachos are messy. In a good way!  The only bummer is that it's a food truck so we can't go back and get more whenever we want! I will be on the lookout for this truck at future events for sure so I can get my nacho fix!

I'm a true meat and potatoes kinda gal so when a new BBQ place opens up of course I gotta check it out. The boyfriend and I hit up Rudy's on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00pm. We were a little surprised to find the parking lot packed and when we walked in there was a long line. At 2:00pm! I'd hate to see the line at the lunch or dinner rush. I've heard the line is often out the door.   Anyway, we got in line and began to look over our menu choices. We decided on the brisket and the pulled pork. They had a few sides but nothing I was that impressed with. No french fries and no mac n' cheese. But they did have peach cobbler so I got that.  They sell their meat by the pound. Since we were getting it to go we ordered 1/2 lb of brisket and 1/2 lb of pork. For the brisket they literally open up the smoker, take out a huge slab of meat and cut your slices off and weigh it in front of you. Awesome. Meat-tastic even! We grabbed our bag o' meat, some sauce and headed home.   The meat was very tender and tasty. The sauce is more of a spicy BBQ sauce than sweet but went well on both the brisket and the pork. I liked the pork best, but boyfriend prefers the brisket so everybody wins I guess. And the cobbler was excellent too.   I'd like to go back and try their prime rib that they make on Sundays. they also make breakfast tacos. Hmmm. Maybe that's what I'll do tomorrow....

Stopped by Rehab on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy but after a short wait we managed to snag a good spot on the patio.  I really liked the big selection of burgers and toppings possibilities that they offered. I ended up doing a BYOB (Build Your Own Burger) with cheddar, lettuce, tomato and thousand island dressing on a pretzel bun, along with the sweet potato fries. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger without the hot peppers and regular fries.  Our orders came out quickly. Mine came out with regular fries and when I mentioned that I had ordered the tots they brought me the tots with no hassle at all.  The burgers are big, even the smaller size. But they were very flavorful and the ingredients were fresh. The bun was nice and soft too - good bun to burger ratio.   The mac and cheese on the burger was a fun combo. They really load it on! And the tots and fries were good too.   Overall it's a lot of food, a cool laid back vibe and solid burgers for sure.

So since everyone is comparing this place to In-N-Out I will base my review on a comparison of the two.  1. the atmosphere. Pretty similar to In-N-Out. It's got a classic burger joint kinda feel. Although it's very loud. Some coworkers and I went at lunch and we had a hard time hearing each other. It was very busy and the music was cranked.   2. the burger. Okay, so it is more expensive than In-N-Out but it's much bigger. I got the small and it was still a pretty thick patty plus you get all the toppings you want. I like that there are so many options so you can customize your burger. I got mine with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I thought the meat was flavorful, the veggies were fresh and the bun was fresh too.  3. the fries. WAY better than In-N-Out. I've never really understood why people think the fries at In-N-Out are so great. Yeah, they're fresh but I think they are a little bland. Five Guys fries are also fresh but have a much better flavor. They are cut much bigger and the portion is huge! We each ordered our own fries (all of us were Five Guys virgins) and not one of us finished the order. One guy ordered a large and it was insane. The five of us probably could have shared a large. Or at least a large and a small. We threw away so many fries it was redonkulous.   Overall, my group left Five Guys stuffed and satisfied. I think it's just as good as In-N-Out if not better because of their awesome fries.

You know how sometimes you find a little gem of a place hiding in a blah strip mall? Crepe Bar is one of those places. You could drive by this place a million times and never notice it. But you're luck if you do, because it's really good!  The boyfriend and I went for breakfast on a Saturday. It was busy but not packed. We ordered 2 crepes to share - the breakfast burrito and a banana brulee. The crepes came out to the table pretty fast which was good because we were starving. We started with the sweet crepe. SO good. We could have easily downed a couple of these, they were that good. They had a nice sweet syrup on them that wasn't too heavy, just right, and the sliced up banana complemented the caramely flavor well.  Then we moved on to the breakfast burrito. It was a nice change change from the typical tortilla burrito. It was stuffed with eggs, bacon, cheese and an avocado salsa. It had a little bit of a kick but nothing too crazy. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the flavors all worked well together.   Between the two crepes it was plenty of food for breakfast and it came out to around $12. Can't beat it! We'll be back for more crepes soon I'm sure.

Overwhelming is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Ultimate Consignment. This place is HUGE. Like, crazy huge. Like, you could spend all day there huge. The boyfriend and I love to thrift but after a couple hours we were beat - and I know there's stuff we missed. At first I just kind of walked around in a daze, overlooking the different sections. But then I started digging into the shelves in one corner of the store and that's where I A) found some cool stuff and B) realized just how much stuff this place really has.  The way it works is that each item has a code on it. You write down the code, and then enter it into one of their computer stations. If it's under a certain amount, $35 I think, then that's the price, no negotiating. If it's over that, you can haggle with the consignor. The store clerks will contact the consignor with your offer and they can either accept it or not.   We found a handful of things that came home with us but even more things we had to resist. If you enjoy thrifting you cannot miss checking this place out.

I was looking forward to trying this place after reading a number of the good reviews. I should have read more of the bad ones because unfortunately they better reflect my experience.  The boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. It was busy so we put our name on the list - no problem. The hostess said it would be about 20 minutes. It was very crowded by the host stand so we went and waited outside, right by the door. 20 minutes came and went and we never saw her come out so we went inside. After a minute or so, the hostess came up to us and said "oh, I couldn't find you guys. I can seat you now." Couldn't find us? We were RIGHT outside the front door. When there are 20 people waiting in the "lobby" wouldn't you think to look outside?   So she takes us to our table but did not bring menus so she said she'd be right back. She never came back. The waitress came up to greet us and we had to ask her for menus. She must not have liked that we asked for menus because she was crabby and short with us the rest of the time we were there. (Actually, I assume it's because we didn't order beer. Or she was just a B.)  Boyfriend ordered the burger and I ordered the grilled cheese with spam. We both got fries. The fries were meh, the ketchup was weird - more like pasta sauce and the sandwiches were pretty meh too. They weren't bad but they weren't great. They were forgettable. Writing about my sandwich now I honestly can't really remember it vey well. Not a good thing.  After we finished it took forever to get our bill and they never cleared our plates even though we were clearly done eating. We ended up just shoving them to the side and left with barely a thank you from our waitress.  Needless to say between the crappy service and the sub-par food we won't be back.

I'm a sucker for a good plate lunch so it doesn't take much for me to check out a place that serves Hawaiian food. When I found out this food truck was going to be near my house I knew what I was having for dinner. Yes, you can have plate lunch for dinner.  If you don't know plate lunch is typically a serving of meat (teriyaki chicken, beef, etc.) a scoop or two of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. Some places have other types of salad but in my opinion mac salad is this only real option.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken and boyfriend ordered the fusion tacos. Both entrees were $8 a piece.   First of all the portion were huge. I swear I have never seen tacos this big. They were like burrito size. He described the teriyaki chicken taco as a mini chipotle burrito with teriyaki chicken as there was rice, beans and a kind of salsa in the taco. He liked the chicken better than the pork.   In my plate lunch I got two large pieces of chicken, two scoops of rice and an oversized scoop of mac salad. The chicken was cooked well and had a good flavor but I would have liked more sauce on it. Maybe a little container on the side? The rice was good and the mac salad was tasty too. Not as good as Aloha Kitchen but better than most other places here in town.  Overall I still rate Aloha Kitchen as my number one place in town for Hawaiian but Island Loco is now a close number two.

I was craving fried chicken so of course I went to Yelp and Ezekiel's popped up. After looking at a few pics of the chicken, mac and cheese and cornbread we hopped in the car and made our way over.  We both ordered the chicken dinner (dark) with mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole. The dinners also come with a piece of cornbread.  The food took a little bit to come out but when it did it was piping hot so you know it's freshly made. The chicken was actually too hot to eat at first so we dove into the sides. The mac and cheese was solid, nice crispy layer on top, not mushy at all. But the sweet potato casserole was fantastic! Big chunks of sweet potato, fluffy marshmallow, mmm, mmm mmm! So good.   Once the chicken cooled down we quickly made out way through our two pieces each. The coating had good flavor, it wasn't too thick, and the chicken was nice and juicy.      A man came out from the back at one point and I assume he was the owner as he was going around talking to people. He was very friendly and knew many people by name so this is definitely the kind of place that has regulars. I can see why. Next time my fried chicken craving kicks in again, I would go back for sure.

It is so nice being able to have GOOD food at the airport instead of standard fast food junk. I've enjoyed dinner on the go from LGO the last two times I've flown. I love that the salads are quick and ready to go. The smoked salmon salad is delicious and filling. It doesn't look like a lot when you first open the container but it's bigger than you think.  Their pizza is also very good but head's up - it's not premade so it takes about 15 minutes. Make sure you have enough time to wait. Their bakery items are also really yummy.  The set-up seems a little confusing for people but the staff is friendly. This place definitely makes airport food not only bearable but actually enjoyable.

It's always a good day when a good food trucks comes by your work. So the day I tried out Satay Hut was a good day. I went for the full lunch - two kabobs, rice and salad. I did the mix and match so one chicken and one beef. Both were really tasty but I have to say I liked the chicken slightly better. It was cooked well, not dried out, and tasted really good with the peanut sauce they included. The salad could have used some kind of dressing. The peanut sauce was okay but it seemed like that was really intended more for the meat. I just kind of mixed everything up so it was all good.   The food came out fast and everything seemed fresh. I'd definitely get my lunch from here again.

Federal Pizza is absolutely deserving of 5 stars. Amazing food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. All around this place is great.  The boyfriend and I hit up Federal PIzza for lunch on a Saturday. It was busy but we were able to snag a comfy booth in the middle. Our waiter, I think his name was Dan, was immediately welcoming, funny and charming.   The menu has lots of yummy-sounding choices but we decided to try the wedge salad and the prosciutto pizza. The salad was a bit of a twist on the traditional wedge. It was made with romaine instead of iceberg (which was a welcome change) and had dates, tomatoes and ranch dressing with gorgonzola instead of the traditional bleu cheese. The size was generous - at least for two - and the flavor combinations worked well. A good start to the meal.  The pizza was out of this world. Loaded with fresh prosciutto, arugula, dates and ricotta cheese. This is easily my new favorite pizza in the valley. The crust was doughy and chewy in the best way possible and cooked perfectly. Every bite was delicious and surprisingly filling.  Of course we did save room for dessert (there's always room for dessert). We ordered the donuts with chocolate sauce. There were eight pretty big donuts covered in sugar and served hot. Not warn, hot. Yum. Dip those suckers in the chocolate sauce and you'll have a hot donut celebration. One thing I thought was a little weird was that they took our dinner plates and did not bring small plates for the donuts. Our table was a mess of sugar afterwards. But who cares, they were delish.  Overall I was very impressed with Federal Pizza. I already want to go back. Hopefully they will open one in the East Valley, pretty please???

Love my haircut and highlights from Jude!  I've been looking for a good salon for a while and I think I finally found it. Foxtail is a small salon - 3 chairs - and felt like an old school beauty parlor in a way. Not because they were old fashioned or anything but because everyone talked to everyone, at one point even a friend of theirs stopped in and joined the conversation. I'm used to just talking to my stylist so this was a fun change of pace.  And Jude did a great job on my hair. I got a cut and partial highlights. The highlights turned out great, just the right color and it looks very natural. The cut is cute and easy to manage.   I felt like she listened to what I wanted and delivered great results.  The only downside is the parking. Parking in downtown Tempe is not great and now that the big surface lot in front is closed the only options are meters or the garage. If you're getting color I would not recommend meters as I was there over two hours - the meter limit.   But that's not their fault so I will definitely be going back!

My family and I had a very nice lunch at Gertrude's. We sat outside and the staff was very accommodating in setting up an umbrella just right to shade out table.  I ordered the cheeseburger, done medium well. It was cooked just perfectly - done but not overdone. It was still juicy and flavorful. I loved the dressing that was on it and the bun was fresh. The fries were also very tasty. Some have said the portions are small but that was not the case with the burger. I couldn't finish it and believe me I like to eat.  My mom got the chicken sandwich which comes with cole slaw on the burger, which I thought was unusual. But she said the chicken was cooked well and was flavorful.  Our server was very nice and attentive. My only complaint (and why I docked a star) was the hostess. There was a wait so I gave her my name. She told me it would be about 15-20 minutes and then asked for my phone number. I asked her if she would text me and she said yes. 25 minutes passed and no text. We were sitting just outside the door so I went in and she said she was waiting for me. I told her I thought she was going to text me. She said only if she could get us in early. I've NEVER had to check back at a restaurant. They always come get you! Especially since we were sitting right there! So I thought that was weird and disappointing that we sat there for more time than we needed to. I guess if I hadn't checked we'd have been sitting even longer! They need a new system. Like maybe the system that every other restaurant on the planet uses.  Anyway, I would go back because I liked the food but now I know to be wary of the hostess.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a Bosa fan tried and true. But as a runner up I vote for AZ Donut Co. Their donuts are fresh, they offer a good variety and they are friendly. They don't have anything that really stands out  - no specialty donuts or anything like that (at least not that I know of) but they have your typical variety of cake donuts, glazed raised, twists and jelly-filled. But when you need to get your donut on do you really need more than that?  I give 'em a solid 4 stars.

If you're looking for a challenging workout try Ten Point 5. Before coming here I had never done a barre class and it was way harder than I expected it to be, but in a good way. My muscles will literally shake during parts of the workout.  It's a combination of stretching and strengthening using your own body weight as resistance as well as the barre, a ball and a strap for certain exercises. Even though you're not running or jumping or anything like that you will definitely feel like you worked out at the end.  The studio itself is very nice. It's clean, well kept and bright and airy. And you have to wear grippy socks, which is not my preference but it does keep the funk factor of the mats down I guess.  This is good alternative if you don't like regular gyms or are looking for a different kind of challenge.

If you like garlic, you'll love Hummus Xpress. They do not hold back! I don't know if it was any one item or everything but I had garlic mouth for the rest of the night. Luckily my boyfriend and I both got dinner so it was okay - haha!  But besides sweating garlic I really liked this place. I love the Chipotle-style way of doing the food. I got a bowl with rice, beef, carrots, quinoa salad, classic hummus and tahini sauce. Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Some of the beef pieces were a tad on the dry side but overall it was good. Maybe it had been sitting a while? Also, the tatziki sauce was too strong for my taste so I would skip that next time. It's a lot of food. I ate half and was full so if you're like me you can easily get two meals out of a bowl.  Boyfriend has been looking for good falafel for a while now and he said it was very good. It must have been because he ate it all before I could try any!  The guys working behind the counter were really nice too. They were very patient and explained everything to us noobs. I will definitely be back for more!

So this place is kinda advertised as Scandinavian but I'd say it's really more international as they also have German, Polish and even French-Canadian food on the menu.   My boyfriend and I started our dinner with poutine. If you don't know, poutine is French-Canadian and is fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. It was delicious! We quickly inhaled every gravy-covered bite.  For our entrees I went with the Shoe Maker's Box, which is basically pork loin with mashed potatoes topped with bacon, mushrooms and gravy. It was quite rich and very filling. They give you lots of potatoes! Overall it had a good flavor and the pork was cooked well.  My boyfriend went for the elk stew which is more like a stroganoff than a soup-like stew. Lots of meat served a top egg noodles. He really enjoyed it. The elk was a bit gamey for me. It was good but I don't know if I could have eaten more than a few bites.  For dessert we had the Beaver Supreme. It's an attractive desert and tasted good but the meringue made for a mess at the table. One cut in and crumbs flew everywhere. Glad we got it for the experience but next time I would probably order something else.  The service was good and the atmosphere is comfortable. I definitely want to go back to try their Swedish meatballs.

My boyfriend and I used to go to the old Matt's location pretty often. We loved the food but we got sick of the wait times and stopped going. We decided to give the new spot a try and I'm so glad we did! We arrived around 9 on a Sunday, ready to wait. But although the restaurant was full our wait was not long at all! Less than 20 minutes maybe? Although it could be because we were willing to sit at the counter. Whatever, we were happy!  We settled in and opened our menus happy to see old familiar favorites. I ordered the waffle with bacon and my boyfriend got the pancakes. They were every bit as good as we remembered. Huge portions and full of flavor. The pancakes and waffle have almost a sweet flavor to them but they're not sugary. Just right. The bacon is my favorite thing though. Thick, peppery, bacon-y goodness. I'd say it's the best bacon in town.   I'm so happy to have rediscovered Matt's. It's sure to become a regular choice for us once again.

AZ Food Crafters has one major problem but it's definitely not their food - it's their name! It sounds like a catering company. By their name alone you would never guess what they offer. Their name should be Awesome Hand Pies because that better reflects what they are all about! Not that anyone knows what the heck a hand pie is either but still.   Anyway....the boyfriend and I discovered AZ Food Crafters at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market. We were looking for a bite to eat, and they were offering breakfast hand pies so they got our attention. A hand pie is like an empanada or a hot pocket if you will. It's a flaky pastry shell stuffed with whatever they like - eggs and bacon, green chili pork, or apples and cinnamon just to name a few of their options. We gobbled up their eggs and ham pies with no problem!  So last Saturday we were craving some hand pies and went online to see which market they might be at. And we discovered they now have a shop - yay! Breakfast plans complete.   Their store-front is small but cute and clean. It's all open so you can see their whole set-up. But they have a few tables set up in front so you can eat there. You can also just get their pies frozen if you prefer. We chatted with the owner while we munched on our breakfast. He's super nice and laid back. We enjoyed talking with him and our breakfast was yummy, of course.   These guys are making great food, even growing a lot of the ingredients themselves- bonus points! And if you check in on Yelp they'll give you a free dessert pie - awesome!

This is my new favorite place for fish tacos. The boyfriend and I went here for lunch and each ordered one fish and one shrimp taco. When you get them, they are plain - just the fish or shrimp. But then you head over to the salsa bar and add the topping that you want.   I added the slaw to both and got a few sauces to try on the side - avocado, chipotle and cilantro. They also have different salsas, ranch, tartar sauce hot sauce, limes, and more so you can really customize your tacos.  The slaw was fresh and crispy. All the sauces I tried were good but my favorite sauce was the cilantro. It was creamy and not overpowering.  The tacos are pretty big, bigger than street tacos. Two were enough for me, boyfriend did go back for a third.  Both the shrimp and the fish were really good and I love that you can add the toppings that you want. I will definitely be back!

Between the cupcakes, the gelato, the cookies and the incredible english muffins I don't even know where to begin this review.  So I'll just start here - it was awesome!  I had no idea LGO made so many bakery items! My favorites were the cupcakes and the english muffins. Who knew an english muffins could be that good? The two that were in our goodie bags did not last long at our house that's for sure. I think I've found my new addiction.  It was fun to get a "behind the scenes" look and taste. I don't know if it was all the sugar but I don't think I've laughed that much in a long time.  Thanks again, Lindsay for a fantastically sweet evening!

I'm so happy to have a healthy restaurant option close to home. A girl can't eat donuts all the time, you know.   The boyfriend and I went to Chop Shop on a weeknight. The place itself is super cute and when the weather is nice they have lots of outdoor seating.  I ordered the chicken prosciutto sandwich and he ordered a tri-tip bowl with sweet potato hash. First of all, the portions were really big. We both only finished half of our meal and had the leftovers for lunch the next day. So it's not cheap food but if you consider you're getting two meals out of it then it's actually pretty awesome.  My sandwich was really good. The chicken wasn't dry, the arugula was fresh and there was plenty of fig spread (yum). The bread was also tasty and fresh.  Boyfriend really liked his tri-tip bowl, the sweet potatoes were a nice alternative option to the rice.  I can't wait to go back and try one of their salads. I think this is definitely going to become a new regular place for dinner.  Tip - there are a few parking spots in back so you don't have to pay at a meter.

Ever since the boyfriend and I discovered empanadas in New York we have been dreaming of finding something comparable close to home. Enter Republica Empanada.  When we saw the menu online we got excited because there were a variety of options, many quite similar to what we had experienced in NYC. Our expectations were high and Republica Empanada did not disappoint. We both ordered the lunch special - 2 empanadas, rice, beans and salad for $7.50. I chose the Hawaiian and the El Capitan, both were very, very good. The shell was done just right - crispy but not greasy. And there was plenty of filling with a good ratio of ingredients. They served them with a spicy cilantro sauce on a side that definitely had a kick but was very tasty. The rice and beans, though simple, were flavorful and a nice complement to the empanadas.   The place itself is clean, contemporary and comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and helpful explaining the menu options.  One thing to watch out for when going there - they are on First AVE. Apple maps will take you to First STREET (thanks a lot SIRI!) So watch out for that.  I can't wait to go back and try a few of the other flavors. This is sure to become a regular place for us.

Tried out the Great Pho King Food Truck yesterday for the first time and was really impressed. I ordered the chicken and veggie stir-fry. The order was very large so you get your money's worth. There was an ample amount of chicken, peapods, green beans, carrots, and water chestnuts. There were also bean sprouts. Many bean sprouts. In my opinion way too many bean sprouts but they may have just gotten overzealous. And all of this was served on white rice.  Regardless of the sprouts, the dish was incredibly flavorful. All the ingredients worked really well together. I thought I'd only eat half but ended up eating almost the whole thing because it was so tasty.  Overall I really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely hit up this truck the next time it's by my work.

This food truck is one of my favorites in town. They know how to make a darn good pizza.   I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. It was basically chicken and cheese with BBQ sauce instead of tomato sauce. Simple but the flavor was there. The crust is cracker-crispy but not too hard, just the right amount of crisp. I would have liked just a touch more sauce on my pizza though, or maybe a little extra on the side for dipping? Regardless, I managed to eat the whole thing.  The guys working in the truck were super nice too. My friends order got messed up so we ended up waiting a long time but they made him a new pizza and even gave him a card to get a free pizza next time which was cool.   I'll definitely get another pizza the next time this truck cruises by my work.

The Crypt is a great haunted house, even if it is in the parking lot of a mall. There are 2 houses and a maze. The maze is not all that great in my opinion. But both the Crypt and the Asylum are fun to go through. Like all haunted houses your experience can vary depending on when you go through the line - timing is everything. But we've been a couple times now (this year and last) and got a few good screams in both so we were happy.  It's good halloween fun and nothing too scary for older kids.

This may be my new favorite restaurant. I had dinner with my family on Friday night and it was amazing from beginning to end. We totally pigged out so here's the rundown on each dish:  Chicken Liver Pate:  They make it with pistachios so it's a light flavor than regular pate. Very tasty.  Fondue:  This was one of my favorite items. Rich, gooey cheese served with pork, bread, and pears. Each item paired perfectly with the cheese and the pork was excellent.  Chopped Salad:  Like everyone says, this salad is amazing. Seriously one of the best (if not the best) salads I've ever eaten. If you order only one thing, make it this.  Hillbilly Egg Roll:  Made with meat from Little Miss BBQ. Ours was made with the brisket. I've had Little Miss many times (it's fantastic) so the eggroll was just okay for me. The meat is pretty greasy as is so to add the greasy egg roll shell was a little too much. Honestly, I like Bobby Q's version of this better. Plus, I thought it was kind of overpriced - $12 for ONE eggroll? Really?  Macaroni and Cheese: Not a classic mac 'n' cheese but it's good. They use the same cheese as the fondue so it's ooey gooey.  Good but not my favorite dish of the night.  Scallops and Grits:  Totally awesome. The scallops were cooked just right and the grits with the balsamic were delicious. They should have those grits by themselves as a side dish because they are excellent.  Chess Pie:  This was better than I thought it would be. Chocolately but not fudgy and the ice cream on top paired well with it.  Banana Pudding:  This was SOOOO good. Yumminess in a jar. Banana pudding with big chunks of banana, caramel, whipped cream, a cookie on the side. OMG.  The atmosphere was nice, although it did get pretty loud once the restaurant was full. Our server was great too. Very attentive and fun without being overbearing. And if you like whisky, they have an extensive whisky menu.  Get yourself to The Gladly! You'll be gladly that you did.

The concept behind Fired Pie is great - completely customized, individual pizzas. When we first got there the line was long but it moved fast. I made my pizza with garlic and oil, meatballs, cheese, spinach and artichokes. It didn't take too long for them to bring it out either. The flavor was good and the pizza was cooked well. It got kinda messy on my hands though - all the cornmeal and ash from the fireplace made for a sloppy eating experience. Maybe a fork and knife would be better for this kind of pizza?   Also, the place itself is very loud - especially when every table is full. It was too hot to sit outside but when it's nice out that's what I will do next time if it's as busy.

For a West coast desert town, Phoenix seems to have a large number of really great pizzerias. Pomo is no exception.   My boyfriend and I visited Pomo on a Friday night. We snagged a table on their huge covered patio and settled in. Our server was very attentive, even trying to light our candle again and again every time the wind blew it out.  We ordered the kale salad (which is a version of a Caesar but with kale) and the peppino pizza. The salad was a perfect portion for two people to share. Lots of croutons and fresh parmesan and not too much dressing. It had a good flavor and the addition of kale gave it a heartier texture.   The pizza was delicious. Lots of flavor, the crust was cooked perfectly and just the right amount of cheese. Again, it was a nice size portion for two people to share.  For dessert we chose the cream puffs. They come three to an order and are covered in a yummy, fudgy chocolate. Needless to say, there was not a crumb left on the plate.   Officially adding Pomo to our list of pizza places to visit again!

Boyfriend and I visited The Henry early on a Saturday night. It was a warm day so we sat outside on the patio which has a very pleasant, laid back atmosphere.  We started with an order of cheddar popovers, served with ham butter and herb butter. They come in an order of 3. They were good but not amazing. The butters were really good though. If they had a bread basket and served it with these butters, that would be a knockout.   For our dinners I ordered the pork chop and boyfriend got the Chevy Chase, which is a steak sandwich. He really enjoyed his sandwich a lot. The steak was done just right and the roll was fresh. The fries were cut really thin and were tasty as well.  My pork chop was delicious. First of all, it was huge - a very thick, bone-in chop. It was served with caramelized onions on top, a cauliflower "polenta" and chard. All the items were cooked to perfection and the flavors went together very well. The chop was tender and juicy, the chard was full of flavor and the cauliflower was a nice way to round everything out. Even the onions were good and I usually hate onions. I would definitely order it again.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake. It is served in a jar, which we were not expecting - we thought it would be a slice - but once we took at bite we didn't care how it was served, it was so good! It's ooey, gooey goodness in a jar is what it is. Get it, you'll love it.  I can see why this place has gotten so many great reviews and why they're saying this is the best Fox restaurant yet. I have to agree - from the atmosphere to the service to the food, this place is fantastic. I like all Fox restaurants, honestly, but this one does stand out as one of the top. I can't wait to go back and try their brunch.

I definitely have a crush on Waffle Crush. This truck is not serving up your average waffle with maple syrup. They are thick, similar to a Belgian waffle and they'll load your waffle with chocolate, ice cream, whipped cream, fruit, Nutella - whatever you like. They also have this topping called Biscoff that is awesome. It's kinda like Nutella but better. It's made from cookies and has a bit of a peanut butter-like taste. Try it, you'll like it.  I got a Biscoff and banana waffle with whipped cream. When they brought it out I thought they messed up and gave me ice cream instead. No joke! I've never had whipped cream like this - it was so thick! And delicious, duh. It's very rich and filling. This is not an every day waffle unless you have an iron stomach and run marathons. But as a treat, it's indulgently awesome.  This truck is a great addition to the growing food truck community. Get out there and support good food, people!

Tried Aioli Burger for the first time last night and thought it was pretty solid. I ordered the signature burger - the Aioli burger and fries with chipotle aioli for dipping. The woman taking orders was very friendly and made the ordering process very easy. The burger came out in just a few minutes.  The burger is a pretty big, loaded with cheese, aioli (of course) lettuce, tomato and bacon onion jam. The burger was cooked to order (medium) and had a good flavor. The toppings were tasty and a good compliment to the meat. The bun was fresh, which to me can really make or break a burger.   The fries were good, they had a little bit of seasoning on them that for me did not pair well with the chipotle aioli. They were much better with just regular ketchup.  Overall I enjoyed my meal and would go back.

Little Miss BBQ is in a weird location. It's close to what looks like industrial junk yards and there are a few seedy strip clubs. But get over it and go get some BBQ because this place is serving up some serious meat!  It's a small place and the counter is right there when you walk in the door so don't be surprised if you see what looks like a line out the door. There are tables out back so there's actually a decent amount of room for dining in despite the small building.   I walked in and the owner hands me a chunk of brisket. Fatty, juicy, meaty, yummy. Sold. I ordered the brisket. For sides - cheddar jalapeno grits and beans.  The meat is by far the star of the show here. This was some of the best brisket I've ever had. The bark on the brisket is smoky perfection and the inside is so juicy and flavorful, you really don't even need sauce. That said, their sauce is really good. It's more sweet than spice, although they do have a spicy option if that's your thing.   The grits were good too, could have used a little more cheddar and it would be nice to have an option without jalapenos. The beans were a disappointment. I really didn't like the flavor. Just not my thing I guess. If they could get some better sides and some dessert this place would be even more awesome.  We ended up talking to the owners for a little after our meal. Super nice people. I love it when local businesses have good stuff and the people behind it are good as well. I will definitely be returning to Little Miss.

Some friends were raving about the burger at Tarbell's so my boyfriend and I had to check it out for ourselves. We followed their lead an ordered the double burger but split it and an order of shoestring fries.  Even though our burger was halved it was still presented very nicely and the order of fries was the perfect amount for two people to share.  We ordered the burger medium and it was done just right. The burger itself was juicy and flavorful. The topping were fresh, the cheese was melty and abundant and the sauce was a great flavor addition. The bun was also nice and soft. I will say it was messy, but a good burger should be, right?  For dessert we had the Boston cream pie and our friends had the donuts. The Boston cream pie was fantastic. The chocolate on top was super fudgy and the cream was rich and silky smooth. It was kinda small for sharing but just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. I tried one of the donuts and it was good but the Boston cream was definitely better.  Great service, nice atmosphere, delicious food. A successful Friday night dinner I would say.

I love donuts. I make it a point to find good donut shops when I travel, that's how much I love donuts. So when I heard Fractured Prune had opened up of course I had to go check it out. I loved the concept of customized donuts. Even more I loved the fact that they serve their donuts hot. But that's where my love for Fracture Prune ended.   My boyfriend and I got a few different flavors to try out. All of them were way too sugary sweet. I ate one and felt like I was sinking into a sugar coma. And it left kind of a bad aftertaste. But the worst part was how I felt later. I reacted to these donuts as if I ate MSG. When I eat MSG I get super crabby and that's exactly what happened after I ate these donuts. No thanks!  And they were expensive - $2.00 a donut. I'll stick with the cheaper and better tasting donuts from Bosa.

I've been to Flower Child twice now and been impressed both times.  The first time I ordered the kale salad and added salmon. It was absolutely delicious. Everything was so fresh, it wasn't overloaded with dressing, and the salmon was cooked to perfection. It was a perfect combo.  The second time I ordered the sweet potatoes, corn & quinoa and salmon again since it was so good the first time. This dish was also really delicious. The salmon is flavorful, juicy and not fishy at all. The sweet potatoes are cooked just right - soft but not mushy and seasoned really well. The corn & quinoa is my new favorite thing. I need to figure out how to make this at home!  Some people complain that the portions are small but I think they are just right. Most restaurants serve portions that are way too big. I'm willing to pay more for healthy, responsibly sourced food and I'm okay if that means the portions are smaller. Flower Child makes it easy to eat well. I just wish I lived closer so I could go there more often!

Having been to other swap meets here I had low expectations going to Thieves Market for the first time. I expected it to be a lot of crafty junk and knockoff handbags. But I figured it's only a dollar so no big loss if it's a bust. I was happily surprised to find a lot of actual vintage items there! There was a lot of cool furniture, lamps, clothes, kitchen stuff, and trinkets to rummage through. And yes, it's used. I have to laugh at the reviews that were annoyed at the fact it's almost all used stuff. It's a flea market - that's the idea! A good portion of it was pretty overpriced though so that was a bit of a bummer. But since each booth was manned by a different person, that of course varied depending on what you were looking at. And I did overhear one woman try to haggle and fail so I'm not sure how big haggling is here although I would think most vendors would be open to it.  It took my boyfriend and I about an hour or so to walk through the whole thing. I bought a pair of earrings and he almost bought some car stuff but decided against it. So we didn't come out with an awesome haul or anything but I would definitely check it out again.

I was in the mood for something other than the usual breakfast fare of pancakes and eggs so when ISS' came up on Yelp it looked like a good option. And it was!  My husband and I walked in and were immediately welcomed and walked through the options - oatmeal or pancakes. We decided to try both - I got blueberry vanilla oatmeal and he got a pancake with cashew bacon. We also got a s'mores donut and a smoothie with strawberries, spinach and almond milk.  The donut was the best vegan donut I've ever had. Often they can taste kind of plastic-like but this one had a really good flavor. It was a little crumbly but nothing we couldn't handle.  The oatmeal was excellent - very hearty and filling. And they used fresh blueberries, not freeze-dried or anything. The smoothie was also really tasty. But the real (and surprise) winner was the pancake with the vegan cashew bacon. It was way better than I expected. It was smoky and sweet and the real (yes, real) maple syrup really brought out the flavors in the pancake. Delish!  Oh, and did I mention neither of us are vegan or even vegetarian for that matter? When the food is good, it's for everyone!

Postino has long been one of my favorite restaurants in town so I was beyond excited when they opened a location closer to my home. And upon first visit they totally lived up to my expectations.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty busy but we managed to get a good table right away. It's much larger than the original location. We started with the butcher's block, which has a few different kinds of meats, cheeses, nuts and bread. It's all fresh and yummy.   For my meal I got my favorite - the prosciutto and brie sandwich. This is seriously my favorite sandwich anywhere. It has a ton of prosciutto, creamy brie, sweet fig jam and arugula on crusty bread. It doesn't get any better. I also got the mixed greens side salad, which at most places would be really boring but at Postino it's amazingly delicious.  While I may be biased because this location is so close to my house, I have to say I think I like this location even better than the original. It's a very welcome addition to Tempe!

Now this was my kind of Yelp event! A fun exercise activity followed by a fantastic, healthy meal - what could be better? Okay, it doesn't always have to be healthy. That time we got at eat pork belly was good too, but I digress.  This event was aptly named as I definitely got my butt kicked at Orange Theory. I went on the treadmill first and ran so by the time I got to the floor exercises I was pretty spent. Those who power walked were smart! I definitely feel like I got a good workout. My abs and arms are so sore today! I thought it was an interesting concept, I'd never experienced a circuit training gym like that. If the price was right I would consider going back.  Speaking of going back, I will definitely be going back to Flower Child. Fox Restaurants has a winner once again. I was so surprised when we got to order anything we wanted off the menu (what, really?!) so I went with the kale salad and salmon. So delicious! The portion was large, especially the piece of salmon and everything tasted so fresh. The salmon was not dry at all, the dressing on the salad was light and flavorful and there were large slices of pear and grapefruit along with almonds and dried cranberries. Yum, yum, yum. We also got to try their kombucha which I've never had before, and some of their juices. Then to top it off we each got a little lemon cake for the road. I'm so in love with this place I can't wait to go back.  Thanks again Lindsey and Yelp for yet another amazing event. They just keep getting better and better!

Being from MN originally I was already familiar with Erbert & Gerbert's but it's been years since I've been to one so I was very surprised to find one here! My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Saturday. This place is small! But it wasn't very busy so seating wasn't an issue.   I got a half Narmer, which is turkey with avocado, and a cup of chicken and wild rice soup. The soup was delicious. A mainstay up in MN or WI, not too many places here do wild rice soup and this was done just right. The sandwich was just pretty good. The funny thing is that like most sub shops they cut out the center of the bread, but here they give it to on top of your sandwich. Which worked out great for dipping in soup! Anyway, like I said the sandwich was pretty good. The ingredients tasted fresh enough but I wanted the French bread to be a little softer. The bread at Jimmy John's is super soft so I was hoping for something similar. But overall, it was a solid sandwich.  There is a lot of competition when it comes to sandwich shops in downtown Tempe now but I think there's a place for E & G. Especially if you're looking for a sandwich on the go.

Stopped in to Delice Bistro on a Saturday morning. I was surprised by two things - 1. How big the place is. For some reason I was expecting something smaller. Maybe because it's a bistro? But what's in a name... 2. I was surprised that it was not busier. Granted, it's still summer so maybe once students are back it will pick up.  It's an order-at-the-counter kinda place so my boyfriend and I did just that. I went with a crepe - mushroom, egg and cheese. He chose the bananas foster French toast. We also got a chocolate croissant to share.   The croissant was very good. Super flaky, lots of chocolate. Yums all around. Unfortunately the meal sis not quite match the greatness of the pastry. My crepe came out plain on a plate. No garnish, no sauce, no presentation - no nothing but the crepe. And now, I know I ordered a MUSHROOM crepe. BUT. It had way too many mushrooms. It really overpowered the egg and cheese. And the whole thing was just kinda dry. A nice sauce would have really added a lot. The crepe itself was very good, however. I bet their sweet crepes are good.  My boyfriend's French toast had a similar ingredient overload issue - way too much caramel! The first few bites were good but then it just got too rich. Less is more, you guys.  Since the croissant was such a win, on the way out we did grab a chocolate chip cookie. Like the croissant, it was done very well. Super fresh, lots of chocolate. Yummy, yummy.  So I'll definitely give them props for their bakery treats - really, really good. If they would just even out their entrees, this place would be 5-star worthy.

I really wanted to like The Normal, I really did. But after the breakfast we had I have to say I don't.  My boyfriend and I visited on Saturday morning. We got there a little before 9 and it wasn't very busy yet. In the parking lot there was a car with a backseat window smashed so that's awesome. I assume it happened overnight but who knows.  Anyway, we were sat right away and given menus. Our waitress came over and offered drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. Considering we just sat down and this is a new restaurant that's not a chain, we said we needed a minute. She must have counted 60 seconds because she was back very quickly. I don't know what the hurry was but we ordered - I got the minimum wage (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes) and my boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy.  Our meals came out and the first thing we both noticed was my eggs. They looked really weird. Really crumbly and dry. They tasted kinda weird too - actually they didn't taste like anything - they were just bland and unappetizing. I'm guessing they were powdered? I've never had "eggs" like this before. The bacon was meh. The potatoes were pretty good and the homemade jam for the toast was good. (tip - ask for the jam, my toast came out with none) Boyfriend's biscuits were super dense. The sausage was overcooked and tough. For the price of the food, I would expect the quality to be much higher.  By the time we were done the place had filled up. When our waitress left our check and said "have a nice day" she wasn't even looking at us. How sincere.  We left feeling very unsatisfied and on the way out I commented that I wished it were still IHOP. It was a total bummer of a breakfast.

Chicken and donuts - two of America's favorite things. Add those to the team behind Welcome Diner and you've got an awesome new place!  Visited on a Saturday a little before 11AM. There was a line but we didn't wait too long. My boyfriend and I both got the two-piece combo. I chose the Japanese BBQ and the chocolate donut and he went Korean with a maple bacon donut.   (Okay. I know what you're thinking - isn't this a fried chicken place? What's with the Asian sauces? Asian chicken with donuts? What's going on?? Yes, it's a weird combo. But trust me, somehow it works and it's freaking fantastic so just go with it.)  The Japanese BBQ was out of this world. So delicious. It was tangy and flavorful, definitely more of a Japanese flair than BBQ. The Korean sauce was good but a little too spicy for me. So if you're a fan of mild, go Japanese. The pieces are smaller than what you get at a KFC or another place like that. It actually reminded me that chickens aren't supposed to be that big so I was okay with the smaller pieces.  I got the miso corn as my side. It was good but a few too many peppers for my taste. If it was just the corn I'd have gobbled it up.  Okay, on to the donuts. I hate to say it but they were just okay. I really wanted to like them and after the amazing chicken expected big things. I didn't like the maple bacon donut at all (weird, right?!) The bacon part was good but the donut was a little too chewy and left an odd aftertaste. The chocolate cake donut was better but was a little grainy. I have to say that my boyfriend went back the next week and got the regular donut and said it was very good. So save the upgrade and go regular donut I guess!  So despite the so-so donut I'm still giving this place 5 stars just for the chicken. As we were driving away I already wanted more. Needless to say, I will be back!

I've been to the Earl of Sandwich at Downtown Disney and loved it so I was excited when I found out they were opening in Tempe. If you've ever been to one at Disney you'll be as surprised as I was to see how small this location is. It's long and narrow and only has a few tables so if it gets busy you may want to just take your sandwich to go.   That being said they do have my favorite, the holiday turkey, which is basically thanksgiving on a sandwich - turkey, stuffing, cranberries, gravy and mayo. Yum, yum. It tasted just as good even without the droves of Disneyland fans circling around!  Now I know this is a new location but their staff was painfully slow. There was only one person ahead of us in line and we stood there for several minutes. Then when we finally got up the counter either the guy working the register didn't know what he was doing or the computer was messed up because he had to enter our order and run my card at least 3 times. Then it took a while to get our sandwiches too. It appeared like the manager was just doing everything and the rest of the staff was hanging out so I thought that was kinda weird.   But regardless, yummy sandwiches were had so it's all good. A welcome addition to the sandwich mecca that downtown Tempe has become.

I'm loving all the new restaurants that are opening in Tempe and Snooze is no exception!  My boyfriend and I visited for breakfast and it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away - it's a pretty big place. We opted for seats at the counter by the window so we could stare outside (and we had a good view of the ping pong table, which was entertaining.)  I ordered the late harvest benny which is sweet potato polenta topped with more sweet potatoes, eggs, fennel and kale and served with hashbrowns. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast pot pie. We both really enjoyed our choices. I love the combination of the sweet potato polenta with the eggs paired with the hashbrowns. Plus, the cream cheese hollandaise gave a nice sweet balance to this savory dish. All mixed together it made for a tasty breakfast hash. And it was very filling.  Overall I really liked the atmosphere, the service was good and the food was yummy. It will be great to go here when it's nice enough to open up the large windows.

When I lived in Minneapolis, Noodles & Co. was one of my favorite quick service restaurants.  So I was thrilled to see a location open up here and went for dinner the same night I found out it was there! It has all the same items as other locations. My favorites are the butter noodles and the mac and cheese. I like to sometimes add meatballs or chicken but the noodles are good on their own too. The service was quick and the people working there were friendly. It's not a huge space and the night I went it was crowded and got very loud. Luckily we found a spot outside but if you sit inside and it's busy just be aware it can get noisy. Otherwise I'm just so excited that now I don't have to go out of town to get my Noodles fix!

What an awesome new place! A few months ago my boyfriend and I peeked in the windows while it was under construction and thought it was going to be a restaurant. We were so surprised when we walked in and discovered a market. (I know it says it in the name but people tend to use that word liberally.)   This place is adorable. Nice open space with exposed brick and beams. It's very clean and very big. There was plenty of seating open on a Sunday around lunchtime. It reminded me of smaller version of Chelsea Market in New York.  They have several places to choose from - burgers, salads, Asian. I went to the Asian place and had delicious bao. My boyfriend went to the burger place and got the juicy lucy - also delish. I love that you can get different types of food all in one place.   There were signs up saying that an ice cream place and a sandwich place are set to open soon. I'll definitely be back to try them out!

Nothing says "I'm an adult" more than ordering a salad on a Friday night and actually enjoying it.   I went for the Kale-ing me Softly salad which has kale (surprise!), sweet potatoes, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, cucumbers and a lemon dressing. I got the small but it was still plenty big for me. And I don't say that because I'm some waif who eats like one cookie and says I'm full. (because I am not) It really is a decent portion.   Anyway...the salad was really yummy and satisfying. The ingredients were fresh, the dressing had a nice flavor and worked well on this salad. I actually liked the salad so much I was inspired to make my own version at home the next week.   So if you're looking for a healthy meal, Radish is a great option.

Definitely one of the best bagel places in town. I overheard them say they boil their bagels, (old school!) which would certainly make a favorable difference.   I've only been in a couple times and both times ordered the bagel and lox. The bagel was perfectly chewy and super fresh and they gave a generous amount of salmon with a huge slice of tomato and plenty of cream cheese. (it also comes with onion but I got it without) It was so delicious and actually quite filling.   The girl working the counter, Heaven, was very nice and welcoming - a real pleasure to talk to. Such a nice change from the places where the person behind the counter barely looks at you.  This is the kinda place where it would be easy to become a "regular." A great addition to the Phoenix bagel scene! (If that's a thing - ha!)

Happy to have a good Asian place in the neighborhood! I cannot believe this used to be McDonald's. They did a really amazing job making the place over. For a former fast food joint stuck with another ol' strip mall they managed to make this place feel inviting yet open and airy.  Okay, on to the food. My boyfriend and I started out our meal with the regular lettuce wraps. They were really good. I could have just eaten these as my meal. We would have liked a little more sauce for them though - mostly because the sauce added so much flavor to it.   For our entrees I went with a chicken and veggies dish - it was a slight variation on the chicken and veggie stir fry and my boyfriend got sweet & sour chicken. The portions were huge - we definitely could have shared. And I liked that they gave us both white and brown rice - perfect for a little mix and match. The ingredients tasted fresh and the dishes were very flavorful. Overall we really enjoyed our meal. And then we enjoyed it the next day as leftovers, too.   We'll definitely be back.

Stopped into ToGo's for the first time today for lunch. Walking in the door I was greeting by a funky odor. It didn't smell like bread, it didn't smell like cleaning products. Maybe it was the soup of the day? Maybe the ham had turned? Whatever it was, it should have been a sign to turn around.   I went up to the counter and the woman working said something to me about a dog and I was obviously confused. I said "what?" and she looked at me and said "hi" like I was the crazy one. Then the woman ahead of me in line came back and it turns out the dog conversation was relevant to her. So another guy came up, saved me from this awkward moment and took my order.  I got the turkey and cheese on parmesan bread. It looked good in the picture but this sandwich was awful. The bread is way too thick and dry. It didn't taste fresh at all. The turkey had no flavor. The mayo had no flavor. It was bland, boring and blah. I would have rather gone to Subway. And I hate Subway.  ToGo's? More like NoGo's.

So happy Simon's has moved to Scottsdale! This was one of our favorite places to go in Sedona and now when we are craving a hot dog we can get one here in the valley.   I've only had the Columbian because once you try it, you will highly doubt any other dog can compete. The beef hot dog, with the sauce, and the pineapple (yes) and potato chips (yes!) somehow make the best flavor combination. I guess it's that salty/sweet magic happening. And it doesn't hurt that the bun is the freshest, softest bun ever. Seriously I want to use it as a pillow it's so fluffy soft.  We've already been twice since they opened. My waistline may hate me for visiting regularly, but my tastebuds overrule on this decision.

Tried Local Lunchbox for the first time today and really enjoyed it. I had the apple bacon salad, which was mixed greens, bacon and apples (obvi) almonds, dried cranberries and gorgonzola in a balsamic vinaigrette. I opted for no onions. It was really delicious! All the ingredients were fresh and crisp. The toppings were generous - lots of thick yummy bacon and apple pieces. The dressing had a really nice flavor to it as well. And it was a good size. It definitely filled me up for lunch.   I hope these guys become a regular in the food truck rotation at my work, I would go back for another salad for sure.

How awesome is it that Shake Shack is now in Arizona? SO AWESOME! Shake Shack was a favorite of our every time we went to New York so to have it in our own backyard is fantastic. We've already gone twice in three weeks.  Obviously, the burgers are a must. The burger itself is a high-quality meat, nice and juicy and I love their shack sauce. But perhaps the best thing is the bun - it's like a little pocket so the burger doesn't slide out the back. Genius.    I also love the cheese fries. One order is big enough for my man and I to split.  On our last visit we tried the Chicken Shack. I will say the chicken was really juicy which is always a challenge on a chicken sandwich but it lacked a little something. Next time I think I would add a slice of cheese to it. It was good but the burger is way better.  And of course there are the shakes! Really yummy and thick. We like the black and white.  Next time we're going for the hot dog. I can only assume we'll have tried everything on the menu by the end of the year - haha!  Both times we went it was dinnertime and the line was long. This may be because it's still new. But considering the locations in NY always had lines too, only time will tell.

I really enjoyed my lunch from Panini People! I ordered the jive turkey with fries.  The sandwich was fresh and toasty, and had a delicious sauce on it that was a nice complement to the turkey.   The fries were pretty good too. They were lightly seasoned and cooked just right.  Fast, fresh and flavorful. All the Fs you'd want out of a food truck.
