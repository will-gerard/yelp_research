Don't Do Online Ordering!  Typically, I really like the food from STNY. Today was my first time ordering from them online - but it will definitely be my last!  I'm no novice at online ordering - I buy lots of stuff online, including local pizza delivery. Wanting something, different, I visit the STNY website, see they have online ordering - cool! So, I create my account, place my order, pay online, get my email confirmation... a few minutes later, one of their employees calls and says, "Yeah, we don't know why but you got two free toppings on this pizza. We're gonna go ahead with it this time but in the future we're gonna have to charge you extra."   Um, WTF?! All I did was click the buttons to indicate what kind of pizza I wanted, the toppings, followed their prompts for payment including adding a tip (even though that was confusing to do). If there's a problem in the way their system calculates out my total, it is CLEARLY a problem with their programming NOT with me the customer! She seriously made me feel like I was trying to get away with something... how could I "sneak" in a couple of extra toppings on their system?! Do they not even think things through before calling their customers with accusations?  They just lost my business. NOT COOL!

Rick, I ordered directly from the STNY website & clearly ordered delivery. You need to have a qualified programmer re-evaluate your online ordering system. For now, we'll continue to order online from Pizza Hut where we get exactly what we order & consistently friendly service.

Everybody Knows Your Name!  I used to go to Mi Patio when I worked nearby in the 90s and LOVED it then. When I returned to work in the area again five years ago, imagine my surprise when I walked in and they REMEMBERED ME BY NAME! It was like coming home to family! The food is every bit as good as it ever was, they service super friendly, the salsa is the bomb, and they are extremely accommodating with changes to items if you need alterations or with making suggestions if you just can't decide. And be sure to always check the chalkboard menu when you walk in - it's always go interesting things you won't find on the menu! Elio and Tammy have been there forever & have great suggestions. The owner, Johnny, is great with kids... if you go in with the kids on Friday, he'll make balloon animals and bring free rice pudding! It's great for happy hour, date night or family dining. My go-to place in the area!!!

Run! Seriously, just keep driving, do not stop. Cabinet doors for cleaning supplies standing open with brooms leaned up against him, employees with their shirts up above their fat rolls, unwashed tables, empty condiment and straw bins... orders took forever. Saw two different people have to get their orders fixed because of so many mistakes (One couple was given to completely wrong combos than what they ordered). Everything from the filthy interior to the creepy clientele and unwashed employees just screamed health hazard. Don't risk your health... Go somewhere else.

Had brunch with my daughter here (finally - it'd been on my list to check out for soooo long!) It lived up to the hype! Love the casual urban chic interior design. The patio seating looked very inviting, too, so I think I'll request that next time. They had the wall open behind the bar which just created the perfect brunch ambiance for enjoying our gorgeous Phoenix winter weather. Was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the crowd -- nice to see older people, trendy hipsters and families with young children all contentedly co-mingling. :)  Brunch portions were VERY generous -- we had to get to-go boxes! Daughter & I shared their cinnamon roll and I'm pretty sure it was bigger than my head (and I have some pretty big curly hair, so that's saying something!) It was so big we were unsure we'd finish it -- and then we tasted it and that sucker was devoured in short order, with daughter scraping every last bit of cinnamon and frosting drizzle off the plate! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Don't remember the name of the dishes we had but it was pretty traditional breakfast fare -- just done excellently. The bacon was divine! Again, generous portions. Might've finished if we'd not started with that ginormous roll, lol, but it was all so very good and we have zero regrets about the excess calories, bwahaha!  My kiddo's a tween so she didn't get to enjoy the free meals they offer kids but if you have young ones, this place should suit everyone -- delicious eats for parents / grandparents and free yummies for the kids. We'll be back. :)

Wish I'd read the reviews before I went here. The negative reviews are accurate. Not very clean. Not kid- or vegetarian-friendly. Very poor quality food. How can an asian buffet have so few noodle, rice or veggie dishes?? The staff are sweet, as someone else stated, but that doesn't make up for yucky food. Disappointed.

Had a white pizza with ricotta, tomatoes and extra garlic... really, really delicious. Very east coast vibe. Doesn't look like much from the outside (well, the inside isn't "all that" by way of ambience now that I think about it), but the pizza is TOTALLY worth stopping in for a slice and return visits! :)

My daughter and I are totally looking forward to future visits very soon. Took my teen for candlelight yoga before her spring break travels (mind you, this is a kid I have to BEG & PLEAD to join me for yoga in the park- type events)... we both loved everything about the beautiful, zen studio! The pacing of the candlelight yoga class was the perfect blend of challenging flow (first half) followed by totally blissed out relaxation and meditation in the second half. Daughter's already asking when we can go again. So, thank you, Urban Yoga, for turning my 14yo into a yoga fan :)  ONLY RECOMMENDATION to UY is to help us newbies get oriented a bit -- had no idea what props we needed in class & then they ran out and we hated to ask since it was all dark & quiet. And nobody told us about needing tokens to get out of the parking lot so that was kind of a pain having to repark, run back in, etc.  It won't stop us from coming back -- just a suggestion so future attendees don't feel intimidated. :)

Friendly local hot yoga studio that won't break the bank. They make a challenging workout totally do-able and even fun.  If you've thought about trying hot yoga this is a non-intimidating place to get started and the two weeks for $20 is a super deal.

Because it's not in my neighborhood, I only get over to Ernie's once or twice a year when I'm really in the mood for karaoke and crab cakes. I've had positive experiences in the past, so I was surprised to see so many negative reviews here on Yelp. Until I went this past weekend.  Because of rainy weather all day, it was no surprise that the place wasn't busy - so you'd expect we'd have attentive service, right? Nope. The first server we had was surly, impatient and definitely seemed annoyed at having to answer our questions about the menu (seriously, she looked as us like we were friggin' idiots for asking questions). The food took a while, the drinks she served were harsh and she never came back to check on us, so I had to go to the bar myself to get my drink fixed (how hard is it to make an orange juice and vodka?) The food, when it finally came was just "meh".  We were sitting too close to a speaker so we couldn't hear each other, so we moved to another booth which got us a different server, but his attitude wasn't any better. We were still basically ignored and had to find someone else to order any additional food or drinks and basically bussed our own table.  My poor friend had the worst of it all though -- she gave her card to the bartender to pay her food & drink tab -- and 45 minutes later he had still not come back. We finally had to go ask WTF? Turns out their machine was down. Um, they couldn't have told us that? They kept us waiting still longer and finally suggested we go get cash from an ATM (which is what her BF had to do). Did they offer anything for this inconvenience? Hell, no!! Same surly attitude from the manager on down, no comped sodas for our DD's, nothing but the inconvenience of having to track down an ATM and get our own damn cash our because they couldn't tell us for a friggin' hour their machine was down!  To top it off, my friend has left her keys in the first booth we'd been in but when she asked three different employees if anyone had turned in keys, WITHOUT EVER LOOKING they all said "no". Until she finally asked a fourth employee (after franctically searching the bar, the restaurant, the ladies room, the parking lot, etc.) "Yeah, said, employee #4, they're right here (on the bar)." Nobody could've looked?!?!?  Yeah, miserable experience, top to bottom. Think we'll find someplace where they actually LIKE their customers!!!

My friend's husband bought ticket for the three of us to go see Romantasy's Halloween show. It was my first-ever burlesque show... and now I'm hooked! It was funny, sassy, sexy, unexpectedly creative and, in keeping with the macabre theme, even at times a wee bit creepy (deliciously so! Clowns, man, clowns are just creepy!) Belly dancers, magician, fan dances, comedy, camp, tease... It really had it all for a wildly fun evening of adult fun. Now, a hugely devoted fan of Romantasy!!

Returning to the Coronado neighborhood and have already made Nami our "couple times a week" stop! Whether for coffee, chai, pastries or vegan ice cream, it's a perfect little hipster joint for a break in your day that all your friends - whether paleo or vegan - will be perfectly happy at.   Simple 60s mod dining room, groovy eclectic music. The crowd is chill, with a steady influx coming & going regardless of the time of day. Blue haired college girls w/ their bearded boys, multi-generational families & LGBTQ couples -- everyone's seems at home here.   Check out Nami!

The kids will love you for taking them to FlipDunk! Drop them off for a couple of hours of jumping, trampoline dodgeball, bungee jumping & flipping, or trampoline basketball. They will be having so much fun they won't even realize they're getting an excellent workout, lol! Get on the mailing list to find out about specials. The second hour of jumping is always discounted. Can book timeslots on their website (a convenience for a geek-mom, like me!) Friendly staff. When you're done jumping, take your receipt around the corner to The Chill Frozen Yogurt (in the same plaza), another welcome addition to our north Central Phoenix neighborhood!

My mouth is ridiculously happy! Decided to try a pasta dish, the Mickey White, with a trio of mushroom, crispy chunks of breaded chicken and spinach in a subtley spicy cream sauce over fusili. YUM!  The hand blended watermelon-mint is a refreshing libation for summer.   My teen got the Casanova pizza with ricotta, dates, prosciutto and arugala. She kept raving about the crust and how she'd "totally" order this pizza again.   So there you have it - two enthusiastic thumbs up!

$2 sushi plates for lunch? Awesome! And it wasn't just Cali rolls - had many of my faves, like Rainbow, Dynamite, Dragon & New York! Plus edamame, tempura shrimp - even dessert! Boyfriend & I picked plates off the conveyor (cute!) & ate till we were full - and got out of there only $20 (after beverages) + tip. Attentive service, fresh tasty affordable rolls. Definitely come back when I'm on this side of town! Eastwind, can you open a central Phoenix location for hungry ASU students & gov't employees? Pretty please?? :)

This wasn't where I wanted to go for happy hour before the Dbacks game but it was hot & my friends didn't wanna walk & this was close. After grabbing our own drink menu, waiting too long to place our order & again for the drinks to arrive, I was giving my crew the "you should've listened to me!" face. And then a manager walked over & said, "You had to wait too long for your drinks & that shouldn't happen. I want you to have a good experience here." Already my mood improved because bad service is so common but having acknowledged? Wow! He comped us two delicious appetizers - nachos w/ shredded beef (the cheese sauce obviously, addictingly house-made) and chicken tenders w/ fries (loved the light, crispy batter on the chicken!) And, yeah, even my cocktail - slow though it was to get to me - was a really good drink. The manager saved our repeat business. We'll definitely try it again. The food & beverages were worth the visit & hopefully they'll smooth out the service kinks, too, to become a downtown fixture.

Do not be put off my this being "only" a hot dog place! This is NOT an ordinary hot dog joint! You get your choice of link (from vegan to sausage to all beef & more), all served on warm fresh naan bread with an unexpected selection of topping combos (peanut butter, anyone?) with your choice of crispy peppery home chips or delicious salad of baby greens with pears & viniagrette. Have converted many a skeptic that Short Leash Hot Dogs is an AWESOME place to grab a meal downtown!

Ashley and some of her instructors have led free yoga classes in the park at the Biltmore on Sundays, offering passes for one free class at their north Phoenix studio. I consistently enjoyed all the park classes led by the Sumits North Phoenix instructors, so when it came time to look for a hot yoga studio, I naturally turned to them. After reading all the glowing Yelp reviews, it sealed the decision!  Today was my first class over there and it was exactly what I was looking for! A nice, super clean, inviting, non-intimidating studio where I can explore the benefits of hot yoga that I hear so much about from my hippie chick sister back in Minnesota. :)  I did an early morning (5:30 AM) session with Courtney, who was very friendly even though I arrived crazy early (as I was unsure how long it would take me to get to the studio). Since I had already checked in on line and digitally signed their release, getting started was super easy. She showed me where the studio and changing room were and I made myself at home.   Everything is very clean and modern. Having been to another local hot yoga studio that had a very bad odor problem, I am happy to say that Sumits seems to be scrupulously clean (whew!!) Things I liked particularly:  the dark hardwood floors, that the music wasn't continuous but when it was in play was "cool" music and at an appropriate level so I could still hear Courtney's instruction, and that she adjusted the lighting throughout the session to facilitate active portions and restful portions. Overall, just really nicely done. Good workout (slightly shaky legged) but actually felt energized. Great way to start the day!  Came home, bought their studio's Groupon and messaged my BFF with a positive review. Will definitely be going back!

Okay, so after my first (very positive) experience at Sumits North Phoenix, I ran home and bought the Groupon (and so did one of my friends, who's also now a Sumits fangirl!)  I've been attending classes for two weeks, experiencing several different instructors. While the routine is fundamentally the same class-to-class (abbreviated for the 60 minute class; expanded for the 80), each instructor definitely has their own style which keeps the classes fresh and each challenging in its own way. Some have a more soothing style, some are more athletically challenging, some are great for newbies because of their focus on excellent form (to avoid injury). I'm really getting an awesome workout plus reducing work-related stress.  And, on top of all that, I've actually lost 6 lbs in the past two weeks without changing a thing about my eating habits! I'm a pretty active girl, regularly doing Zumba, monthly 5Ks with my friends, weekly power walks with the girls -- but hot yoga is kicking my butt! I can see I am getting leaner, feel I am getting stronger & more flexible. Both my daughter & my boyfriend have commented on the obvious weight loss and my suddenly more-defined waist.  Yeah. You can say I'm hooked :)

I can't believe I've not yet written a review of this place!  First, I will confess, I wasn't excited about Bikini Beans moving into the neighborhood. I'm so much of a "beauty is temporary but brains will take you places" kind of girl. But my college-aged stepdaughter LOVES this place & so we swung by for java before a hike. Wow! Forget beauty & brains, this place is all about the BEANS!  Seriously, yes, beautiful girls in swimsuits is an effective marketing gimmick (that results in a never-ending stream of cars going thru their drive), but they take their coffe seriously! My "go to" drink is the Caramel Macchioto with coconut milk, hot or iced, and it's fantastic! It's the perfect balance of coffee bite, smoothness & sweetness! Every first sip just makes me smile because my mouth is so happy!  But try the other drinks as well! We highly recommend their chai which is the best we've had in the Valley - neither too spicy nor too sweet. Just the perfect balance of tea, spice & cream.   TIPS: Be sure to check in on their kiosk because every 10 visits gets you a free drink.  LADIES: Go on "Woman Crush Wednesday" to get 15% off

I really love this neighborhood vegetarian spot! Whether you're looking for uniquely delicious breakfast fare (jalapeno waffles and a horchatte - yes, I did spell that correctly and it's exactly the beverage combo you'd expect!), fresh pastries, lunch (potato tacos!), happy hour (signature cocktails, locally sourced vino), dinner (jackfruit sliders!)... they seriously have something for everyone in your crowd to drool over and you'll never notice that it's non-carniverous! Plus, they put a lot of effort into being a welcoming community spot, so there's also some fun event going on -- DJ spinning, board games, live music, storytellers. It's just one of those places you always want to be at -- like hanging out at your best friend's home but with way better food (sorry, best friend!) If you haven't been yet, it's totally worth checking out.
