In April, I ordered, and completely paid for two chairs. I was told it would be six weeks. As that time neared, I called and left a message for my saleswoman who never bothered to return my phone call. Another saleswoman said she would help. Another week passed with no information. I again called and was told that my chairs were due to be completed by July 4th. Again, as that time passed I called and was informed it would be the end of a July. Another two weeks without a call. I called again and was told it would one be the first week of August. Ok, so now it's August 5th, and I (the customer) call for a follow-up. A gentleman answers the phone and said it's now going to be Mid -August. He said he will call me this Friday. - we will see.  I have a few thoughts - shouldn't my saleswoman be following up with me?  Isn't it common courtesy to notify customers of delays??  I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't called and asked, Thingz would be complacently happy to keep my money and never deliver!    I just got a note from my interior design professionals suggesting we go look at Thingz for a table. No thank you!!!

Does anyone else think this place has gone downhill?  From the ever decreasing portion of guacamole, to the tired salads?  I used to love this neighborhood spot. Buttermilk chicken is my favorite- but tonight, not only was the portion tiny (lots of mashed potatoes to compensate for the sparse protein), but I'm pretty sure my chicken was a reheat!  Bland, dry and sparse. My husband was also disappointed in the portion size of the stuffed chicken, which he described as"ok". Let's hope this restaurant gets back on track. It seems as if other people have noticed- one used to have to wait for a seat, which is no longer the case.

I own a dog. My husband has even taken it to a restaurant or there is a patio set up for a dog. They do not belong at the counter, sitting on the seat that the next customer will sit in. Where is the manager? Won't eat here again. Disgusting.

We were so excited to have another choice restaurant in North Central.  It has a great bar and patio, but I found the menu lacking.  I so wanted to love this place.  The hamburger I had was good, not great.  Did enjoy the fried okra, but found the mac and cheese dry and tasteless.   The wait staff was nonchalant and seemed to be more interested in each other than in waiting on tables.  Also, my daughter and her friends went there for a late dinner (they are all 24-26 years old).  They were carded but the waitress didn't believe them.  She sent the manager over who actually sat down at the table and had them each produce three more cards, which I thought was above and beyond.  After they had emptied their wallets, they did get their drinks, but the waitress, having been shown up, was rude to the girls after that.  It is a shame that this group of young women, who are all med students and law students, were subjected to this treatment and all have vowed never to return.

Mediocre food, slow and inattentive service. Spoke with server several times about peanut allergy and never got a straight answer. Nice place, but not worth the price, disappointing service and mediocre food.

Very excited to try this new place. Staff was friendly. The atmosphere is great. It was after 2 on Mother's Day, which I realize is a busy day, plus it is a new restaurant. We were told it was a 2 hour wait, but that we could enjoy appetizers and drinks on the patio. Perfect!  We were the only ones there as the other table was just leaving.  I should've realized something wasn't working, when I saw a man getting up and getting his own water glasses.  The waitress came out to clear the table and indicated she would be right with us. She came out twice more and steadfastly avoided eye contact- we all know that feeling. After 20 minutes without even water, we asked the hostess who said she would send someone out. After 45 minutes, with no contact we left. End of story. Can't even complain that it was bad service, just no service at all.

Tried for a second time after a dismal first visit.  To be fair, the first visit was when the restaurant was new.  This time, I found the ambience comfortable, staff friendly.  We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer, my husband and I ordered a salad "to start" (key words) and a pizza.  Our companions each ordered the halibut with a side of vegetables and a salad "to start".  Our waitress clarified that they each wanted the halibut dish.  Well, first we received the side of vegetables (about 15 minutes before the appetizer)??  Then we received the spinach dip.  After a few minutes, all of the food came to the table at once.  We indicated that we had wanted to start with our salads, not the veggies. They took the pizza, two halibuts and veggies (veggies by now had been sitting on the table for 30 minutes - back to the kitchen, presumably to put under the heat lamp).  The salad was fresh and tasty.  However, when the food came back, as expected, the halibut was completely dried out.  Our companion did state that it had a nice flavor.  Please note, however, when the food came back, there was only one halibut.  We contacted the waitress who seem befuddled as to what had happened to our other halibut.  Short story, they had to remake the halibut and our companion ended up eating by himself.  Too bad they haven't gotten their kitchen timing down.  Our pizza was soggy and greasy as it too had sat under the heat lamp.  I will say, that I have found lately, that it is imperative as a diner than you indicate your preference to eat your starter before the actual meal.  Many restaurants these days tend to bring all of the food out at once, which I do not enjoy as it makes you feel rushed.  Given the flavor, I'm hoping Pomelo can somehow get on track.

Yay!  A new restaurant that was spot on when it opened. Great ambiance, friendly staff, great service and good food. A friend and I ate lunch here today. We had the roasted cauliflower and split a Cubano sandwich. Cauliflower was tasty.  The sandwich was great -  toasty bread, ample meat.  Crisp waffle fries were delicious.  Definitely a treat. Can't wait to try other menu items.
