Dara Thai is consistently turning out very good food. I have never waited more than 15 minutes for a to go order even when they are very busy. However, I do find the "spice" to be inconsistent. Sometimes a 3 out of 5 will make your eyes water and sometimes it is not spicy at all. I frequent this establishment every other week and will continue to do so.

Stopped by Catch 22 last Friday around 6PM for happy hour. It was fairly busy but there were a few tables available. This is an establishment I have been to over 50 times since it opened. I have not been in for some time due to bad past experiences but decided to give it a chance because I heard there is a new owner.   Our server was friendly and greeted the three of us within a few minutes of sitting down. I ordered an Angry Orchard Cider and my two companions ordered lemon drop martinis. Unfortunately my AO arrived lukewarm and the martinis tasted like vodka and lemonade. I asked our server if she could replace my AO with a colder one. She said sure but returned with ice in my cider. :-(  We also ordered some "sweet potato fries" and "potato skins".  The "SPF" were perfectly cooked and were delightful!!  However, our "PS" arrived about 5 minutes after the "SPF" and looked overcooked and greasy. My visual inspections was confirmed with my first bite, they were awful!  I sure hope "Catch 22" can get their act together because this type of food & drink is unacceptable! Our check total was $38.00.

I really want to like this restaurant!   I eat out 3-4 times a week. I have been to the "eel" at least 6 times over the last 1.5 years. The food quality has been steadily declining. My wife and I love sushi and Teppan style of food. We generally spend $50-75 for the two of us.   We went to dinner with our neighbors there last night. The place was practically empty. We sat at the Teppan table because the people we were dining with wanted some Teppan. We all ordered sushi and I wanted to add a chicken fried rice for a side order since we were sitting at the Teppan table. The server, who was nice, advised me you could no longer just order chicken fried rice at the Teppan table. The owner, Barry, said he couldn't sell his chicken fried rice that cheap without ordering a meal. I explained that I was drinking an expensive sake and I had personally ordered $25.00 in sushi. He actually debated with me for about 10 minutes about how he could not make any exceptions and I would have to order it from the kitchen. I advised him that I would pay kitchen price and I just wanted the experience of having it cooked at the table. The owner, Barry, said he would make an exception this time, but when the Teppan chef started cooking there was no fried rice.   In the mean time the sushi started rolling out and it was the most pathetic tasting and smelling sushi I have ever had at a moderately expensive restaurant. I practically had to choke it down (albacore and toro) to get past the fishy taste.   When the fried rice came from the kitchen it was decent, but very bland. I had a stomach ache last night and did not feel well all day. I was compelled to join yelp to avoid future problems for other diners.   Cheers!

Underwhelmed would be an understatement. We use to frequent Joey's a couple of years ago but we hadn't been in for a while so we thought we would have some dinner there this evening. It was 6PM and there was one other table with one person in the whole place. The cashier was nice but the look on the cook's face was less than enthusiastic in regards to having to work. My wife ordered a Chili dog and fries, both which were cooked correctly and she enjoyed. I ordered Italian beef and a Sausage sandwich with fried mushrooms. The sausage was so burnt on one side it was inedible, the beef was moderately warm but the sweet peppers tasted "strange". My mushrooms were overcooked and the breading was completely burnt.  A few customers trickled in when we were eating so we didn't complain or alert the staff because there was a cashier and one cook. When I finished eating what I could of my meal, my wife went and nicely showed the cashier how our food was cooked. Her response was, "we would have cooked it again if you told us before you ate some of it."  We left it at that, never to return again!  I posted a picture of the sausage and mushrooms as graphic evidence

I love doing business with this company.  They are always prompt and efficient and I never have a problem with my RO unit. During my  recent maintenance visit my technician, Gerardo, explained what service he performed and fixed a small leak in a hose that would be hard to spot.  His attention to detail probably save me a bigger problem down the road.  Thank you!

I have frequented the Viet Kitchen about twice a week for about three years. I have never had a bad meal at this restaurant. You can never go wrong with Pho but I also enjoy many other dishes on their vast menu. The pork & shrimp spring rolls always taste so fresh! Check this place out if you are in N. Phoenix you will probably see me there for lunch!

Avoid this location at all cost. They do not have the first clue about customer service. I ordered a birthday surprise a day in advance to be delivered to my wife's place of work.  This "Edible Arrangements" location is about two blocks away and they were given very specific instructions  about the delivery and that she is an employee at the delivery location. If I was delivering something to a place of business I would assume the person worked 9-5 unless otherwise instructed. At 4:30 I had not heard from my wife so I had to ask her about anything being delivered(completely ruining the surprise). No delivery so I called the store and spoke with a worker, Nicole, who was nice but told me that the delivery person had been out delivering all over town but had not delivered my gift but was on his way over right now. Mind you this store is TWO blocks away from my wife's place of work!!!  So if I would have wanted it delivered anywhere else but next door it would have been there already!!! However, Nicole was a liar because as of 5:15 no delivery. I called the store again and Nicole tells me that the driver was "redirected" and he should be there shortly. I explained that my wife was suppose to have already left work and she was meeting me for dinner and I would like to speak to a manager to get a refund. The manager, I believe her name was Pam, was a complete idiot and tried to make every excuse and practically blamed me for wanting to spend the $57.00 with her company and surprise my wife on her birthday at work. I am mad by this point and it is now 5:30 so I tell her I just want a refund and she offers to deliver it to the restaurant we are dinning at. Are you serious?? By this time the surprise is ruined and  my wife is suppose to have already left work for her birthday dinner. I tell the manager I would just like a refund, the manager finally agrees. My wife calls on the other line and she tells me the delivery guy has finally made it so I tell her to refuse the delivery because we are going to get a refund. I switch back over to the manager and tell her my wife is just going to refuse the delivery and we would like a refund. The manager now says because the delivery person made it there before my wife left work they will not refund the money even if she refuses the delivery. I was more than angry at this point and had a few choice words for the "manager" before hanging up. My wife also said that the delivery guy was less than nice about the whole thing as well. I didn't ask for anything for free, no concessions or other choices were even offered to me to make me a happy and satisfied customer. My wife's birthday surprise sat in her car for three hours by the time we left the restaurant with the fruit and chocolate sweating and losing any of it's appeal. Thanks for NOTHING!!!! I will also be sure to write a review at edible.com/WOW as well as contacting their corporate office. I have used other locations of Edible Arrangements many times without any difficulty what so ever.

I have had breakfast here at least 15 times and have had a  good meal each visit. I find it hard to pass on "Eggs Benedict" but  the  signature Benedict with "special" pea meal Canadian bacon is always a little disappointing. The flavor is great, but the pieces of meat are usually undersized (about half the size of the English muffin).  My  wife always orders the gluten free blueberry pancakes and they are very good.  This is by far the best choice we have in Anthem for breakfast.
