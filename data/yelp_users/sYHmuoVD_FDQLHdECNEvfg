Absolutely delightful. The overall set up is slightly small but it gives it a homey feel. The cocktails were to die for. Love the homemade tonic. I enjoyed the Paloma and The Last Word. We sat at the bar top inside since it was so crowded, and it was awesome to watch the chefs and staff work. Whole team seemed extremely stoked to serve us and be at work which is always a positive. This was last Saturday btw, and there was a line out the door.   I got the Honeybee sandwich and the Brussels sprouts. I tried my friend's jackfruit Po Boy and regular Po Boy. The food was perfect. The exact right amount of home style food with a bit of a twist.   My friends and I also shared a bottle of Provisioner white. We sell it at my work for $12 and I was pleased that they sold it by the bottle for $15. Paired deliciously with the food.   I will definitely be back on Tuesday for all night happy hour. Being in the industry, it's hard to find a spot with amazing drinks and food late, but Welcome Diner pleasantly surprised me!

It's been quite sometime that I have been in, but the last time our server was kind of checked out.  Maybe I would come in more if Autumn was the only server. She's incredibly good at her job and very very attentive, without checking in too much. Just an all around great server.   also some days the food is great, and other days it's so so. I don't know. the sushi isn't my fave but the burgers and fries are good. The Caprese sandwich is the only thing that truly woes me.

Haven't been to this Starbucks in a long time. probably will never return. enjoying my book and coffee, the barista says he HAS to lock up the patio. says open til 9pm, it's 8:15 and your barista, male, spiked hair, bigger guy, is locking up the patio and asked me to leave. very very very rude. this is the reason I only go to smaller coffee shops that actually appreciate my business.  ALSO to add, just saw three different pairs of folks try to come in and get a drink but they have locked the door already.    REALLY? wow

Wow! just absolutely amazing. I am an employee of La Grande Orange and I had never been to Ingo's. tried it out today for the first time!   I had the farmer's daughter with the cashew veggie patty. it had so much flavor and was overall a complete home run! The shattered potato chips were delicious too! And to top it all off the Flower Child was incredible. So well-balanced, refreshing, and I am a huge fan of the Frida Kahlo Tequila used by LGO and Ingo's. mmm!   My friend had the tuna Burger and it was very tasty as well. Great job guys! love that this company takes such great care of their guests, and employees. plus there's so much thought, love, and care put into the food!!!

WOW. I've never been here before, but my good friend Cassie Ratekin used to work at the Shea location. I have tried some Fate Brews before but I have never actually set foot in a location.  $5 amazing, incredibly delicious in house brewed beers. that's insane. these guys are truly showing up staple breweries like four Peaks and santan. not only do I prefer Fate, but I'm stoked to try the milk chocolate porter. I got to try all of the beers and I was very impressed.  Our server did an awesome job too! he said it was his first night serving there. I want to say his name was Nick, but I'm not entirely sure. either way I will be back.
