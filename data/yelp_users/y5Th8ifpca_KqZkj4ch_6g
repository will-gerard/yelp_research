Probably the best meal in Arizona. The pre fix menu is amazing, every course worth the experience.

Ordered kids mini tacos and the meat came out extremely spicy. We asked if we could re order the tacos less spicy and they said it was pre made taco meat. How can you be a gourmet Mexican place with pre made and rewarmed meat too spicy and serve it to children? How hard is it to make ground meat to order. The prices are high, we tried over salted dry fajitas chicken and beef were rubbery and the only saving grace for two stars was the table side guacamole. Service sucked, thy forgot to bring salsa.

Friendly, professional, great quality, easy to work with and competitively priced. My only concern is I will never need to use them again because I'm am 100% satisfied.
