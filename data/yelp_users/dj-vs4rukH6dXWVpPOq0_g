We went for the Bernie Sanders rally and it was MASSIVE underground.   I have been to the Convention Center for countless Home & Garden and Bridal Shows. But this was the first time I had been in the "basement".  The Convention Center put the rally on incredibly well and was VERY organized. Parking was an issue when the center double booked a few parking structures with the Diamondbacks stadium.   The only thing I wish the Center had was more seating or stool rentals (maybe for ID's or something).  I always am cranky at Home and Bridal shows due to so much walking and no opportunities for seating that are not on the floor, plus the 4  Costco's sized basement has ZERO seating. So MAYYYYYBE take a look at that.  OH!!! Maybe less crappy foods offered. Maybe bring a vendor that has more than pig-anus hot dogs.  K thanks.    Otherwise, it's decent.

Why would I make an appointment with any doctor for a shot, and only a shot, and wait an hour for my service?   It is a random Thursday, and have waited an hour now. No apologies, no regard for client's schedules, nothing. If they weren't so good in every other regard I would change doctors.   I drive 30 minutes to get here and will not stay if I'm continually left to wait an hour.   Also, 3 different nurses have walked up to me and called me 3 different names.    THEN, they had me wait an hour to get the shot and then tell me I should have peed in a cup (nobody told me that???). I go to pee in a cup and then have me wait another 20 minutes to make sure I'm not a leper. Get it together!

Worst wool selection I have EVER seen.  Saw associates chatting with each other and with friends more than I saw one look to help a customer.  Asked for help and got a woman who was willing to help but didn't understand what I meant by "wool" and took me to what she thought was wool.  At least she tried.  Her effort gave the place two stars instead of one.  With a store that's such a mess, the associates should be all over trying to help out customers.  Because all I did was walk in, look confused, ask a question, and leave.    Customer service counts.  P.S. I feel like the Tempe location takes pride in their organization and the women that work there have been working there FOREVER!  It's like seeing old friends every time. :)

So I came in earlier today... (8:30 on 5/27/15), and ordered a non-toasted Everything bagel with Garlic Herb cream cheese. There was a horrific line, but it was zipped through fairly quickly. After waiting for 5 minutes to get my food, the food runner (middle aged man with a European accent)  called my name and then confirmed... "Everything bagel with plain?" I was rushed and said "Plain? It's supposed to be garlic herb?"  He then proceeded to take my bagel out of the bag, open it towards him (so I couldn't see) and said "oh yeah!"  "It's garlic herb?" I questioned. "Yeah" he said, put the bagel back in the bag and held it out toward me. I laughed (somewhat rudely, I apologize) because the man roughly defiled my bagel while we were standing by the windows and then basically dismissed me to leave. I took the bagel (hey, I paid for it) and walked out feeling like it was a 3-4 star experience.   I get into my car and drive off. When I finally got a chance to eat my bagel, I bite into it. Plain cream cheese? That guy CHECKED MY BAGEL AND LIED TO ME!!!  I am not so much of a priss where my order cannot be wrong. It's happened before and I deal, graciously and more often than not just eating what I was given. HOWEVER, DO NOT LIE TO ME. He looked at my shmear, saw it was wrong, and told me it was fine.  Ugh!!!  If he's lying to customers, what else is he lying about? Not a good look my man.   My bagel is the EASIEST THING EVER to remake. I am SUPER LOYAL to Einstein's, but I am DONE with this location.

Fast food must not be fast anymore...?  After a 15 minute drive through wait, I drove up, smiled and said hello. I received a curt glance and a price for my food.   I said thank you when I received my food, and the chick turned around and walked away.    Thanks for reminding me why I haven't gone to McDonald's in years.

I have lived in the valley for 7+ years as a college student, and I have lived in 5 separate apartment complexes and one rental house and I can say that these are the WORST apartment complexes I have ever lived in.    Just as heads up I live in the North side of the apartments, and while we have less children over here, we have more teenagers that lurk in the shadows at night. (Seriously).  A huge issue I have is the fact that randomly the outdoor apartment lights and parking lights will be off 2-3 nights out of the month, so if you want to come home late and feel safe, NOT going to happen.  I NEVER feel safe here.  Plus, I just had a neighbor come over the other day (while cracked out) and ask me for $10.  I've never met the dude, I always see him in his house (no job), just a freeloader.  This is the quality neighbor you will reside nearby.   Also, EVERYONE here smokes marijuana, EXCEPT my boyfriend and I, and the one security guard that I know lives here.  It smells like weed CONSTANTLY.  From elderly people smoking medical, down to teens, it's absurd. Plus, it says in the lease that they have a no tolerance policy when it comes to illicit drugs. Joke. I'll bet you that there are MULTIPLE drug dealers that live in this complex, if not a grow house/kitchen/what have you.    Right now it is March 2012, and they have had the pool closed for like 2-3 months, no explanation, nothing.  Fine, not like I really want to go swimming in a freezing pool.  They also have a free (dumb) work-out area that they give free (dumb) keys to all of the residents.  Tip: Make the key cost a ($50) deposit so that I don't see children playing in there, and then make legit people like myself have to pull pens out of the weight machines because cheap b**tards cant afford a $7 pin at Play-it-Again Sports. BAH!!!!   I work out enough to have to deal with this crap regularly, AND NOW in addition to the pool being closed, I just found out (at 8:00pm at night, with the pool chained (classy) and no lights on around my door) THAT THEY JUST CHANGED THE LOCKS TO THE WORK OUT AREA. THANK YOU FOR THE HEADS UP PRESIDIO!!!  P.S.Presidio: Stop wasting your money on a free DVD rental checkout system at the front desk because it's trashy.  Also, when a CURRENT RESIDENT comes to get a package and has to wait 30 PLUS MINUTES to receive said package because your bimbo employees cannot make the prospective residents wait ONE MINUTE while you get our package is appalling.   P.S.S. Don't hire imbeciles who are afraid of dogs when you are one of 2-3 apartments in the entirety of Ahwatukee who allow large sized dogs.   In summation, I would LEGITIMATELY never wish that anyone ever live here ever.  Oh I forgot, we've already had issues with EVERY appliance in the apartment because they're 7-10+ years old. Good luck!

This is officially my favorite sushi place when I want quality and large portion sizes for Nigiri.  I love this place: full bar, teppanyaki, and my favorite sushi that will not be named for fear that they will run out of it.   The rolls are pretty awesome too.  I am a Las Vegas obsessor and it was not my favorite (too much roll, not enough cream cheese), neither was the Smokey Bear (delicate flavors, but I wasn't in the mood for that).  The Blood Orange Roll was heaven (and unlike anything I've ever had).  Then there was something with the Habanero sauce that I DID NOT like, but my boyfriend loved.  The Habanero sauce is all the heat and not a lot of flavor, but I'm less interested in super spicy.  I now know to not order stuff with Habanero sauce.  I gave it 5 stars because nothing was BAD, but was just did not fit my flavor needs. Everything was super fresh and awesome in terms of portions.

Quick and easy... Thank god!!!  I do make a point, however, to never come on a weekend if I can help it.  My favorite location is Tempe Marketplace because it is MUCH bigger, but for convenience sake, I'll stop by here when I need something.

Could not have been happier that they were open cinco de drinko!  I'm always down for a chile relle√±o burrito or a bombero burrito.  Plus, any authentic Mexican place KNOWS to have Fanta on the soda machine. They have this on lock.  Great job guys!

I hate being so mean about a Jo-Ann's but I am DONE with the registers.   I make decisions to NOT come here because the lines are so ridiculous. Why do they have 9 registers and 1 person ringing ALL THE TIME!!! Infuriating.  Plus, I feel like I ALWAYS have to interrupt the cashier because the only people working at Jo-Ann's are 1 cashier and 2 people cutting fabric. I have never in my 10+ times in this store seen an associate who is not in one of those three positions.  It is SO maddening!!!  Bring on AT LEAST one more associate because at least I can find help at Michaels, and if I can't find it there, I'd rather buy my item on Amazon to avoid the BULLSH*T at Jo-Ann's.  P.S. I even have a vested interest in this store as I took a sewing and a cake decorating class here and I am tired of the place sucking so bad.

Being someone that's needing more toys for nieces and the profession I'm in, I love the store.  They have toys that allow for creativity, unlike Toys R Us which seems to have every toy in the world meant for every purpose.  I hate specific toys for specific types of play, I feel it stifles creativity, which is why I love what Lakeshore has.  If it's too far away, they do have a website with more than what they have in store.  PLUS, I love that they have baby and family dolls in all different races, much more realistic than what you normally see with the blond, blue eyed babies that are everywhere.     My biggest minus is the exorbitant price of everything.  But you can get on a text discount thing where they send you discounts over the phone, and if you sign up for the mailing list they get you coupons to your door.  I did do the check-in deal through yelp last time I was there and they hassled me about it saying that it was't from their store.  Yes it is.  Your corporate advertising person put it there, please learn before you speak.  Luckily they took it after I explained to them that it was a product of their company and not of my imagination.  Otherwise, the store is great, but I will be waiting for paper coupons from now on.

The hot vanilla is my favorite thing in the world!!! Mucho calories but bueno for a non-coffee drinker like myself. :) Also, it is probably one of my favorite studying spots, especially with Einsteins next door. THE best.

I still have not had a REALLY BAD experience here.  Yes the lines are long, but if you make a reservation the wait time is less agonizing.  They answered my questions without screwing me around or making me pay for that one to one shiz to get my question answered.  They haven't done anything to upset me so thank you Apple!

Everyone there knows us. Everyone there knows Zoey, our Great Dane.  Everyone is amazing! Which is why we continually drive 30 minutes to go to a Petsmart, so we can get the daycare we know is best for our girl.  Trust me, if I didn't feel safe with her there, or if I felt the people didn't love her, we'd go somewhere else.  But they're fantastic so no worries.  : )

This place is great.   I have been 3-4 times, ACCIDENTALLY.   I obviously check Yelp for places to eat, and somehow I am always in Peoria/Glendale when I am in the mood for Greek/Mediterranean food. So I look for 4 star+ places and repeatedly end up here.   The service is quick, the staff are sweet, the food is consistent, and the portions are perfect.   I will definitely be back again.

Ugh...  The hype and size of this place is why it is getting 2 stars.  Both times I have been here (on a Saturday night) there has been NOWHERE to sit and it has taken 5+ minutes for a beer. If I want a pub feel, I will go to George & Dragon.  At the George & Dragon, it is out of the Central Phoenix melee, has ample parking, seating for days, and takes at most a minute for a drink.   If I am going to a McCaffrey establishment, I would MUCH rather go to Rosie's which is bigger and a few miles away.  I seem to have come here a bunch recently for bar-crawls and I will be avoiding this place like the plague.  I'll go to Hannie's or Cityscape instead, thanks.

I came here with a girlfriend and were told the wait would be 45 min.    We left for 30 min and came back only to find that we had missed them calling us. AH!  We let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).  I did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their "drinks" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I"m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.  I ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.    The Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking.   We were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.    The Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.  We also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil/egg to give a more moist texture.    I will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.  Our waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.  Normally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)

What I came for was a GREAT price on peanut oil and what I got was a GREAT price on peanut oil.  Having never been to a Smart & Final before, I will most definitely say that I will be shopping here EVERY TIME I have a party, because the prices are pretty fantastic.   Plus, I got some pretty decent service too. Thanks!

PLEEEEEEAAAAAAASE!!! PLEASE figure out a 15 minute parking scenario for people who have to drop something off at an office and come back without having to pay for parking.   Police it and if someone is longer than 15 mins, charge them the dollar. That's all.

I'm not going to lie. The service is awful. I come here a lot and I feel that an order is either always screwed up or they are fixing something they screwed up for someone else. It feels like a frat house when I walk in, people cackling, loud objects being dropped, stuff being spilled. (By the way, it is 1:00 pm on a Sunday???) Plus, while I waited to check out, this girl, Cara, sat on the phone talking to a customer like a 13-year-old girl, while the customer complained about getting the wrong order and Cara said the customer will get something free next time. (WHAT????)  If I was an owner I'd clean house. Check out the Ahwatukee location for the best Einsteins. They all have personalities, but aren't obnoxious and wasting the owners money.  Ridiculous.

4.99 Gyro deal with fries and drink. Yum!  I am all over this place like nobody's business.  I love me a great gyro.  But to get it at a great price with a clean restaurant and REALLY nice people behind the counter.  I'm all for it. : )  Great job Gyro's House!

A fun place to go to waste some time, check out antiques and be blindsided by old racist toys or Nazi memorabilia.    Oh the 5' moose head was a shocker too.  Almost freaked out.  The booths are rented by sellers who keep up their booths or shelves. What have you.    That's what I love about it. If I detest or abhor what someone is selling, on to the next one! It's like looking at 200+ stores at once.    Fun time. :)   P.S. It doesn't smell like a lot of antique places do.

This location is right next to my work and is incredibly convenient.   I have been a member of this bank for 6+ years after converting from Satan's Lair (BofA). They are incredible as a banking establishment. I have been VERY happy with this company as a whole. Unfortunately my boyfriend handles the finances so I do not have the specifics on his experience (look for Seann C.) but we have adored them and they have gotten to know us personally at the Tempe location.   They're knowledgeable, nice and do not take me for all that I have (low standards from my abuse at BofA). I am loyal and will stay until I potentially move from the state. :)

I have been going for 8 years to this sushi place.  I now live in Laveen and drive to come out to this restaurant.  The happy hour is amazing, the quality of the sushi is pretty damn good and I love the rolls. Try the mochi if you haven't and the Las Vegas roll is my favorite, even if its fried and covered in cream cheese.   Just try to avoid going when the comedy club upstairs is having a show.  Zilch in terms of parking.  Love it!

This review is solely off of the bookstores because my experienced as a student here were awful.   I LOVE the amount of resources here. As a masters student at another school, I still come here to do research due to the sheer amount of books available to students.  As an alumnus, it is GARBAGE that we have to pay RIDICULOUSLY inflated alumni fees to even check out a book. That is why it lost a star.

I'm a huge fan of this place and always will be.  My boyfriend and I commonly come to eat, before seeing a show at Gammage. The food is always good, the beer is always cold, and the waitresses are always incredibly nice.  Plus, I love their birthday coupons they send out for you to use the next time your in.  I'm almost positive they never expire too. SO WORTH IT!  If you like Indian, Thai, Spices, etc, come.  You wont be disappointed.

My boyfriend, Seann C. reviewed this place and now I need to get in on the action.  THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!  I grew up in Northern Virginia (Fairfax) which has a HUGE asian population, and when the city weather sucks 6/12 months, Pho is there to rescue you.  Pho is pronounced "fuh"... Like do, re, mi FA, so, la, ti, do. Please fix yourselves.  : )   Now I'm in Arizona and I STILL crave Pho like nobody's business and then I heard about Khai Hoan.  Actually, this was my boyfriends first Yelp find and we love it.   My favorite is the summer rolls, and raw and cooked brisket Pho.  The summer rolls are better back east, but I'll take what I can get.  Also, the peanut sauce has chunks of peanut in it.  I don't care but some people like smooth peanut butter instead of chunky... Catch my drift?  The Pho is amazing.  It's exactly the way it is back in DC/VA. But... I have a secret...   I KNOW WHY!!!  The owner is from Arlington, Virginia!!! He's legit.  Not that he wouldn't be anyway as he is Vietnamese.  But there is a certain amount of street cred you attain when you're from Arlington.  Clearly... His Pho shows.    BEST PHO IN PHOENIX, HANDS DOWN!

Having frequented Haji's throughout my tenure at ASU, my boyfriend and I will sometimes come by for a Chicken Shawarma plate, extra pita and garlic when we're craving great food. The other day, we were too late stopping by another middle eastern restaurant as we had only an hour left until our show at Gammage played. We knew we wanted to sit down and eat, but were trying to figure out a place that would serve us, bill us, and send us on our way (in the most efficient and NICEST way possible). Haji's was it. It has been the EXACT same recipe since 2005 and if it ever changed I'd cry. It is THIS EXACT shawarma that made me attempt to remake it for my parents in DC. VERY TASTY, but nothing will ever be good as the original. I hope they know how much of an institution they are. LOVE!!!

Meh...  I came to eat here 4 years ago and loved it.  The problem though is that I think I built it up in my mind.    The asparagus with the hollandaise is always amazing.  They are also known for their martini's.  The problem was that I am a big Strip Steak fan and it just did not deliver. I might have had the filet last time, but it was just okay.  The garlic potatoes are also good too.  The biggest problem I have is that I made this reservation WAYYYYYYY in advance and my boyfriend and I were put in a table that basically was in the middle of the aisle.  I didn't think I needed to ask for a booth because I had a standing reservation, but apparently not.  That kind of bothered me.  I don't think it was worth the price and the table was HORRENDOUS.   I probably wont be going back again. BUT, I think people should try it. It is good, just not good enough for me to continuously return.

I legitimately have no idea what al of the fuss is over this place.   We were a group of 4 there for brunch.  Ordered a bloody mary at the bar that was gross. (I happen to love bloody mary's).    We were sat at a table and then ONLY ordered food that was on Yelp's Quick Tips best foods for Chelsea's Kitchen.  We utilize this tactic to make sure that we eat what everyone raves about.  Unfortunately everything was bland, boring and uninspired.  I quite frankly forgot what we ate, but my faithful boyfriend remembered that he had a white omelet thing and I had some taco rubbish.  It was all a bore.  OH! I forgot the best part,  the waitress spilled a plate all over my boyfriend.  She was very apologetic but at the ridiculous pace she was going, it was bound to happen.  Either slow down or hire more people.  The bill came out to $100+, a fair price for a great meal.  This however was not.    I would have rather eaten at Postino's for the millionth and a half time than have wasted any money on this joke.  I'm sorry, but I will not be recommending this place to anyone.   P.S. The place is filled with 40-somethings and up so don't expect a lively crowd.  In fact if you laugh at all, people will stare at you.

Okay, while I have not been back. I am a HUGE proponent of being touched base with by owners/managers when I have a less than satisfactory experience.  A manager reached out to me and I will be emailing her back, but hearing her concern and that she wanted to make sure that they addressed any concerns I had is a HUGE plus for me.  Enough to go up two stars. Thank you for caring Chelsea's.  : )

We walked over from Joyride as they had a ridiculous 45 minute wait for outside (in the summer).  It could not have been a better happy accident.   We walked in and the line for the "cafeteria style" restaurant was almost to the door, but it moved fairly fast. I had the brisket (4/5) and the pork (3/5) and a bite of the macaroni and cheese (5/5).  We found a booth and enjoyed ourselves.    Pluses: We were there WELL after closing (having no idea we had done so) and not one of the staff said anything to us.  The only reason they got four stars were because my boyfriend said the chicken was subpar, the pork was okay, and due to it raining there was water dripping into a bucket from the ceiling. (It led to the ambiance, but was not fab).   Otherwise, it was great, I would go again.

In the span of 30 minutes I saw two different things that will keep me from ever going back to this mall.  I raced into the mall having to use the restroom badly and when I got into the bathroom I saw a girl standing up, leaning against the bathroom stall, almost asleep (high as a kite), having peed herself.  The cleaning woman who was tending to the bathrooms almost walked right by her until she saw my disgust and decided to see what was going on.  This girl was so gone, a friend had to come in and sit her down on the couches by the food court, urine staines and all.  Next, I was upstairs walking by what I thought downstairs was a free car, until I saw police lights on top and a couple standing by the car.  I glanced down to the first level and realized that the couple was taking a photo of the male with his hands behind his back pressed up against the car. What a way to make a mockery of the AZ police Metrocenter.  The ONLY positive is the Maricopa Animal store in the mall. THAT. IS. IT.  I feel bad for the people that have to work here and see the disgusting people meander into their mall. Clean it up!  P.S. After talking about my experiences at the mall with a friend, she said she'll never go back because last time when she brought her kids.  Apparently, a raunchy rap music video was playing in the food court, which glorifies the idea that women are objects and can amount to no more.  In a FOOD COURT??? I get that your main demographic is high kids that pee themselves in your mall, but people DO HAVE KIDS. Inappropriate.

I'm not going to lie, I have no idea what the hubbub is about this place.  I even gave it an extra star than I feel it deserves because of how old it is.  It is exactly like a tiny gas station market you find when driving cross country and your almost out of gas so you HAVE to stop there... But this place has no gas and not as nice.  I'm also fairly annoyed because another person reviewed this place saying what the business card says about horse tack.  So when I searched "tack" on yelp that came up. I went there and all this place carries is soda and waistline pushing snacks???   TRUST ME... I am VERY into hole in the wall places, and am totally game to avoid the monster chain markets like Fry's or Safeway. But this place is worse than a gas station to me.  I understand the vibe and flair but they are clearly misrepresenting themselves  on their business card.  It even said they had ANTIQUES.  THERE ARE NO ANTIQUES!!! This place IS an antique... That is all.   Let's just say I won't be going back... Charm does not make up for lack of product.

I LOVE Taco Bell. I LOVE it!   I HATE this Taco Bell. I have no understanding of why it takes MINIMUM 5 minutes to order and 5 minutes to get your food, when the 35th Ave and Southern is SO much faster, and the people are nicer. I don't understand why at 6:30 after work it takes MINIMUM 15 minutes for "fast food". If I ever want Taco Bell fast, I NEVER come to this one because there is zero hustle. I am swearing off this Taco Bell and will go to the other location forever now.

This location is the smallest in the valley, so don't get pissed at the employees when they don't have what you need. Go to the Tempe or Ahwatukee location if you want a Home Depot the size of a mall.   We always get amazing service.  Plus, as someone that was s faithful Lowes customer, AND A WOMAN, I have since changed my mind, because the Lowes employees at 19th Ave and Baseline are pretty tactless and inattentive.   Go with Home Depot, they care more.    BUT!!! I will say I prefer Lowes' coupons to Home Depot's non-coupons.  I consistently buy stuff at Lowes that I would have bought at Home Depot if a coupon in the world existed for non-contractors.

After making the switch from Lowe's to Home Depot some time ago I realized that I was a true Home Depot fan and aficionado. Unfortunately recently, I made the mistake of applying to Home Depot for a job position.  What happened is ridiculous and regional managers should be alerted to this type of treatment.  Before I start, I will say that I am a white female who speaks basic Spanish and I also have my Bachelor's degree.  I am needing part time work because I am going to school for my Master's at the moment and needed something part-time while I was in classes one weekend a month.    Now, I received a call back from home depot on February 7th at 10:30 in the morning and it went to voicemail.  An associate named Alex asked me to come in for an interview and left me her name, number and extension to get back to her.  I called her an hour and a half later at noon and left her a voicemail.  I never received a call back, so I called the 9th, that Saturday, trying to get a hold of her.  No response.  I called back the 11th and was told that she had "just left" and to "call back after 1pm" the next day.  I did so and she had also "just left???" At this time it felt like she was avoiding me and I asked to leave her a voicemail and did so.  Two days later I did not hear anything from her so I called back and asked to speak with a manager and let him now what had transpired and he seemed disinterested.  I left a message with him and he told me that she would get back to me.  A week later I have never heard from this Alex associate again.   I am horrified that this is the hiring process at Home Depot?  I am more than qualified for the position I was looking for (cashier) as I was a cashier supervisor for the past year.  I have no secrets, do no drugs, and am incredibly personable.  I am shocked that a business as prestigious as Home Depot would decide it is okay to call prospective associates to set up an interview and then avoid them??? I never would have pursued this any more if the Alex associate had never called me???  Plus, if there is something that was a question or if something wrong popped up, I would have liked to know so I can rectify or fix anything that might deny me a position at Home Depot.    I have since returned to Home Depot and seen the Alex girl from afar and saw an interaction between her and a customer that was SO RUDE. It seems like she does not enjoy her position there and takes it out on the customers, and apparently prospective associates?  This has put such a bad taste in my mouth that I am now back to Lowe's again, even though we've made friends with a couple of the Home Depot associates since they're so helpful.  As a prior supervisor, I would definitely take a hard look at how Alex's performance and behavior is putting people off, because this turned a loyal Home Depot customer into a loyal Lowe's customer.  P.S. I have since found a job at IKEA as a part-time supervisor,  clearly they thought I was incredibly qualified for the position. Thank you for your time.

Like I say EVERY TIME I leave a BofA, I hope that every branch burns down to the ground.   With nobody in any of them of course, but this organization needs to sustain such a financial hit to feel how HORRIBLE they are to their customers, and how many lives they have ruined.  I hope they go belly up one day.    Not this specific branch, BUT all of them.  But this branch DOES suck. Just like all of them do.  P.S. When I'm waiting 30 minutes to talk to the ONE office guy that's there, don't play on the computer looking at hotel rooms and rental car prices and COMPLETELY ignore me two awful greeters by the front door (one black dude, and one skinny brunette hispanic chick). Also, short female hispanic manager, who I know could have helped me with my issue. Do not stare at me saying absolutely nothing while you walk by me repeatedly to go talk to the losers by the front door and giggle. I wish I had names.

Great, every time. INCREDIBLY CHEAP!!!!  I always get the chicken feet, bao, and some steamed yellow pork thing.  ( I never remember the name).  Always the same quality, always sweet people that work there. I love it...  Actually... Now I want to eat there... Damn.

Went to the Barbara Seville Show and it was AMAZING. My boyfriend got felt up by a drag queen and he said it was the most amazing birthday yet.    Tips: - Reserve tables over the phone - Get there 20-30 mins early to get drinks and chill. - Bring $20-30 in single bills to give to the ladies when they perform. It's fabulous and necessary.  Good luck! :)

This is most certainly NOT a Fry's Marketplace. Fry's Marketplaces sell all of the home goods, this one is definitely not one. I just walked in and all of the floors are ripped up, tres sanitary! Plus it's dingy and small. Blech!

God, I feel bad for this but the food was just REALLY REALLY not good.   I waited for 20 minutes for my food, (which is fine for bomb food). I took the food home and ate it with my boyfriend and the food was SO lackluster.  It was almost on par with mall food court food.  I feel horrible saying this because everyone who worked there was incredibly sweet. But that is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1.   HOWEVER, I really liked the market.  Additionally, I like that they make large quantities of food and put them in the freezer so that one can buy them in bulk and heat them up for parties at home. THAT, is fantastic.   The Market is great, the food is 'meh'.

As a 6' tall woman, you may understand my need for a go-to tailor.   I currently live in Laveen and this has been my go to shop for 8 years.   They ALWAYS do a great job, and the one time a seam they sewed fell out within a month, they fixed it for free.  Fantastic mom and pop store, and I will come here until I leave Arizona.    If you need a tailor, I HIGHLY recommend these wonderful ladies. :)

Let's be perfectly honest upfront and state that this review is solely for the bar in Brunswick and to be perfectly specific about a WONDERFUL bartender by the name of Hazie.   Arriving at the bar, Hazie greeted us and asked us if we wanted anything. We said no at first so we could converse with friends for a minute before making up our minds.  I convinced my friend to get a San Tan Mr. Pineapple as he had not tried it before. She immediately countered saying that a pitcher would be more cost effective in the long run if we were looking to have 2+ beers.  We consented and thanked her for the info.  A little bit later we ordered food. It took a little longer than we'd hoped but we were with good friends and had great beer so we were fine with that.  The food came out, and without anybody having to ask for anything, silverware, ketchup, and a question if everything was all right ensued.  We said yes and began to nosh our finger foods.  This is where the best part of the night occurs.  After drinking the pitcher of beer for a while, my friend and I were on our last glasses from the pitcher.  You know how that is. The last lukewarm part of the beer that everyone dreads in getting a pitcher.  Nay, good gent or gentlewoman. As I was standing a good 15 feet from my and my friends beers, out of the corner of my eye, I spy little bandana'd Hazie walk out from behind the bar with two frosty glasses.  I spy enviously at her, wishing my two beers were cold.  When all of the sudden she stops at our full lukewarm beers!  I watch, like a 1930s Englishman on safari, at the goings on to see this lovely gem of a woman pour my lukewarm beer ever so gently into these frosty glasses.  ::GASP:: A-MA-ZING!!!!    My friend and I never uttered any words about the beer being warm, to Hazie or anyone else in our party.  We never poo-poo'd at the beer. Hazie came on her own volition to make sure that what we were drinking was the best that it could be. I was stunned.  My boyfriend is an unbelievable bartender, and he was almost furious when I told him I had met his match at Brunswick.  BRUNSWICK YOU SAY?! Oh yes.    Oh, and by the way, she made me an unbelievable Pineapple Upside Down cake drink that was one of the smoothest, but beautifully alcoholic beverages I have ever had.  She is a gem.  I would go more often if I didn't live in Laveen. But next time I need a bar in that area, she'd better be there.

I had a great time there.  Walking into the smell of popcorn is orgasmic.  That... was... amazing. We went last night and I guess the "Brides of March" bar crawl had started there earlier. The bartender was attentive and knew his stock like the back of his hand. He gave service with a smile which is unprecedented in the Phoenix bar scene.  We went with a same sex couple but it was obvious there were some glares towards us "breeders".  No problem, I am not into screwing up safe places for others to drink.  We stayed for a beer and then went on our way.  I would have no problem going back, but don't want to mess up the ratio, if you know what I mean.

To be perfectly honest, this "marketplace" is nicer than most AZ malls I have been to lately.  I.E. Metrocentre... YIKES!  It has some basics and some nice shops to check out while waiting for a movie. So I don't see the problem. Plus, free public music acts are an awesome touch.  Where else do you see that? (Okay other malls but not many and not as often).  Good job Tempe Marketplace.

This is my favorite dog park in Phoenix.  Namely 1. It is kept up rather well both by the city and by the locals who take care of it. 2. People will ostracize your dog if it is aggressive. Sorry for people who have dogs with issues, but you will not have to worry about a dog staying in the park if it attacks. ESPECIALLY with a police station next door.  3. Pit bulls are NOT looked at funny here. We judge the dog (and the owner), not the breed. 4. It is spacious and provides a comfortable amount of room for lots of dogs. 5. The Great Dane rescue I work with has had a couple of meetups here, so if 10+ Danes can run freely here, comfortably, you know it's good.   ONLY BAD THINGS 1. Location for me, I'm in Laveen, this park is not. But I don't trust people at a lot of parks so I make the trek when I can. 2. IF IT IS A RAINY DAY!!!!! There is a significant ditch in the park that collects water whenever it rains.  Not an issue for my prissy Danes, however, if you have a water dog, skip the day.  Or bring jugs of water to rinse, and plenty of towels. : )

It really is unfortunate the type of service that I had at this location this past Wednesday.    I came in with a list of lipsticks that I wanted to try on, having never been to a Mac store, ever.  I have been to a Mac in a Nordstrom's before and have bought items online. But at my 29-years of age, I had never been into a store because the stores are so intimidating.  I walked in, and saw a gorgeous blonde helping a couple women. She had an AMAZING personality and was really engaging.  I was excited to see the type of experience this other lady was receiving.   Super excited, I whipped out my Filofax with all of the lipsticks I wanted to try for a PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EVENT.  A woman with long dark hair walked up to me, and asked what I was looking for. I stated I had a few lipsticks I was wanting to try on, and started listing a few names.  She walked over to the lipsticks and started plopping them in front of me.    Being used to Sephora and Ulta, I was expecting to have a wand of some sort to apply the lipstick, and because I had these lipsticks placed in front of me, I wondered what to do.  I asked if I was just supposed to try them out of the tubes and she said yes.  (Maybe she does not realize I'm a Mac store virgin?)  I communicated that fact, and she (without looking at me) nods but makes no attempt at engaging me.   Okay, got it.  SO I started to try on these lipsticks, Morange, Hug Me, Angel, etc. The lady helping me and another brunette stood 2-4 feet behind me and just started talking to one another.  As I start asking the brunette (supposedly "helping me") questions, she does not look at me and just answers, gong back to her conversation.  I tried to engage her with the importance of my visit, hoping that she would understand that I might need an opinion or two.  But after a while, it completely felt like I was wasting her time.   I communicated about two lippies that I was interested in, asking her if there was any other color she would recommend. She takes a look at the lipsticks, and says "no, not really".  No suggestions about lipgloss, lipliners, etc.  I was DEFINITELY down to put some money away at this store, but I was officially put off.  I actually contemplated walking out and not buying the 2 lipsticks I loved, but I was already attached.    At some point, the blonde salesperson came over and complimented my Filofax.  It was a sweet gesture, and showed me that there are clearly SOME people interested in engaging with customers at this store.  The unfortunate part is that all of the girls at the store were asking my lady questions. So I can assume she has either been around a while or has a prominent position.  (SUPER UNFORTUNATE!!!) I work around the corner and would have been back.  Definitely not now.   The worst part is that my coworker is a prominent Youtuber who uses Mac products A LOT.  I haven't told her this story yet, but I'm sure if she asks me to go to the store with her as a happy-hour spend-fest, my story will not motivate her to spend the bank she normally spends at THIS particular store.  P.S. Her Employee ID Number is 408217, unless she has the ability to ring sales up under others' numbers. Oh the shade of it all.

We ate here in a hurry as our dog was being monitored at the Spay/Neuter clinic across the street.  We split a Gyro plate that included a very tasty salad, pita's etc. Our waitress was INCREDIBLY sweet and attentive. Just an all around pleasant experience when were were going through some stressful stuff with our dog.   We ended up coming out of necessity and LOVED our impromptu lunch here.  We live in Laveen, but if ever in the area again, we will be making a stop again. It was great!

Gross, just absolutely gross.    Going to school to become a therapist, you wonder why people act the way they do and then teach their children to act just as deplorably.  This is the WORST Walmart I've ever been to and avoid it at all costs.    There is not enough sanitizer, good manners, and hope in the world to fix this place. Just demolish it and put in a Target.

I will say that I overall DETEST burger kings as I feel their burgers are filth and the rest of their food is too.  Then came the deep fried cheese ball.  I saw an image for Cheesy Tots and though that sounded amazing after a day of near starvation. I pull up, and a LOVELY guy named Jim came to the window.  We schmoozed and he told me about the Cheesy Tots and that they're made to order and never frozen (nice) and because they were made to order, "IF I WANT TO EAT THEM IN THE CAR, I SHOULD WAIT A BIT FOR THEM TO COOL SO I DON'T BURN MYSELF".... THANK YOU!!!!! I was so prepared to drive off and pop one in my mouth only to feel the volcano of heat within my mouth which could have caused me to do something REALLY stupid on the road.  Because he truly wanted to make sure that I did not hurt myself, or others, he took two seconds to tell me that and I greatly appreciate it.  If he's a window guy, he should be a manager... If he's already a manager, he should be a regional manager... and so on.  Jim, singlehandedly took someone who hadn't eaten Burger King in 10+ years to someone who is willing to try it out more so now.  Thanks a ton Jim! You earned it.

I love walking through this store.    As someone with ADHD, I find that to ameliorate any issues with being scatterbrained, I must be organized to a fault. This place allows me the luxury to do so.    I have walked in here 3 times (I live in Laveen) and each time, the store has something new to help me maintain my organization.  It always helps in a way I didn't realize was necessary, but is completely so.

I'm starting to love this place. It's a far cry from my time in China but the flavors are good and they are on point with orders. I always get a little sushi and decent I will say.  But like America decent, not like Japan decent.  Also, I always get Lo-Mein because I'm white but here it is FANTASTIC. So greasy but SO delicious!

The food is decent but I always turn into a fat kid and order too much. Like 2 drinks, a sammy, a soup and two desserts, too much. Then, by the time I get everything, I have a few bites and  am full. BAH!!!!!!! Nothing really tastes great re-heated, AND I DETEST going on Sundays because every family has brunch and there is NO parking. I had to watch a woman in a walker shuffle from parking around the corner to the door, with help from her husband, because all of the handicapped spots were used and the place was PACKED.  I enjoy it, every time I go, but I am avoiding Sundays from now on.

Okay, I LOVE this sushi restaurant.   The number of rolls were awesome, the food was fresh and well made when it came out. They had TORO (fatty tuna) at a GREAT price. ::Sigh:: Memories.  I will say we ended up going for a Saturday evening and it seems our waitress forgot about us, because another one had to come take care of us the rest of the night, even though the other waitress was still there?  Normally I would have knocked it down to a four star, but the Toro was so clean and at such a good price, I had some spine tingling moments with my favorite food of all time.   Please work on the service (I know it's a busy night but you should know that going in), but Chef's keep up the amazingness. : )

The buffalo panini was messy but amazing! And the Brazilian Chicken Grilled flatbread was great but different. It had almost a jerk/honey mustard taste to it. Great place!

We came here for a friend's 30th birthday and I actually really enjoyed the experience.  We had a private area to eat, the food (while Americanized) was very good. Plus, the beer choices for a Mexican restaurant were decent (they have Bohemia).  I am on a CRAZY diet and have to have my food come out in weird ways (annoying I know but it's temporary) and the waitress was VERY accommodating with it.  She got everything right and was super attentive, which we very much appreciated.  I wouldn't mind returning at all.

Popped in for a quick lunch and was expecting nothing much.    We got amazing service and wonderfully flavorful food.    I will say, as someone that lived in China for a summer, I am pretty critical when it comes to Chinese food.  This food is definitely Americanized but it hit the spot like nobody's business.   Plus, we didn't even do a happy hour or special and we still thought the food was decently priced.  Maybe because we just moved from Ahwatukee we're used to being ripped off.   Honestly, the front dining room is spotless and the waiters/waitresses are the most attentive (without being annoying) I've ever seen.  They're great.

This place is GREAT!  I've never been someone that enjoys frozen yogurt as much as everyone else does.  However, when a friend recommended this place to me, I decided to give it a shot on a recent hot day that we had.  Now, before I begin, let me preface this by saying that I have tried other yogurt places in the past. (My boyfriend loves frozen yogurt). Unfortunately, they were okay, albeit sticky, but there was never one that made me crave going back for more.  That's when Aloha Yogurt stepped in to he picture.  The minute I walked in to a CLEAN yogurt shop (SHOCKER!), the owner offered me tasting cups to try out all of the flavors, which was great because I think he has like 8 flavors of yogurt at one time or something.  Plus I am VERY indecisive.  So that was a huge plus.  After deciding that I was going to go crazy, I packed a bowl of cake batter, peanut butter and coconut (All AMAZING).  I wanted to get a bowl of some of the diary free options, but I decided I would save that for another day.  I don't know what it is, but their frozen yogurt just tastes more fresh and more flavor-ful than other yogurt places.  Maybe because most other yogurt places are so corporate and all about the dollar.  You can tell the owner is there for the customers and cares about the flavors right down to the sprinkles.  (Side Note: He told us he is very particular about the sprinkles he gets from a certain vendor because they're more flavorful than most one can normally buy.)  It's that sort of attention to detail that impressed me.  Then on to the toppings. Yes, they have the usual toppings, including some different stuff like carob chips, granola, kashi and mochi (for the health conscious). The brownie is especially good! It doesn't taste like the usual freeze dried brownie parts that most yogurt places include. I LOVE that they have Ghirardelli pumps for chocolate, caramel and this amazing white sauce stuff.  BUT, the creme de la creme is this liquid version of marshmallow fluff that the owner has come up with that is MAGICAL!!! It tastes like liquid marshmallows mixed with the center of Cadbury cream eggs. I wanted to take home a jar of it! Lol...  Lastly, after packing everything in, I get to the counter thinking I'm going to pay a mint for this monstrosity I had created and the price was INSANELY reasonable.  I think the fact that it isn't corporate allows you to pay for the yogurt and not pay money into the pockets of big whigs that could care less about the people.  We talked with the owner and he is a really nice, young, down to earth guy that just seems to love talking with people.  It's little gems like this place that remind me why I love AZ.  ESPECIALLY when I forget, like on a hot day like today.   By the way, I'm officially a frozen yogurt convert and now I check the Aloha Yogurt facebook page to see the new flavors every day.  : )

I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star.   We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.    They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.  We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.    We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.  Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.  Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )

This is the worst rental company ever.  Apparently if you're local you need proof of insurance AND a utility bill. Go f yourself!!! NO YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION!!! Crooks. They claim its in the rental agreement, but when you book through a third party vendor (priceline, kayak, etc) they don't say anything about that???? Walked right over to Advantage. I'm glad, because Advantage bent over backward to help us after hearing this ridiculous story. Payless does not deserve ANY of our money.  P.S. If you look at the 30+ filtered reviews this place has, you can see that people make Yelp profiles to write about their negative experiences with this place. When your anger is so bad that you create a profile just to get the word out, then you KNOW this place is bad.  There is a possibility that some are fake. BUT, with the majority of the reviews all being one star and then all of the filtered reviews being one stars but one time reviewers, you can't help but wonder if this place is trying to be as awful as it is.

I have been with Dr. Herro's office since 2004 and have wholly appreciated the experience I have had with them.  4 years ago my mother bought me a Groupon and I had my teeth whitened.   Recently I had a major deep cleaning (I didn't have dental insurance for 4 years) and my tech (Jessie, a dude) has been fabulous and incredibly accommodating. My family even overpaid for services and they reimburse us with a credit on my account.  It was awesome to see.   I am a loyal client and will be staying with them, especially in their fancy new office. :)

Okay, so I've been to the Gilbert location, and the recently closed Alma School location and never had an issue...  I officially had and issue!  So we walked in waiting for a table and... that's it. We waited for EVER! We stared at a few waiters and waitresses who looked at us, and the guy waiting behind us and nothing... We sat at the entrance looking at people expecting someone to check on us, and finally an older grey haired woman, CLEANING HIGH TOPS IN THE BAR AREA, looked at us... AND WENT BACK TO WHAT SHE WAS DOING!!!!!!!!!!  BAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She was the only person for miles wearing a polo so something told me this was our gal.  However when she decided she was done, she trounced over and acted like we had been there for seconds when we had been there for almost 10 minutes waiting for life!!!  She annoyed me...  Word to the wise: PLEASE DO NOT DISAPPEAR FOREVER WHEN YOU HAVE A LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR A TABLE TO SEE SOME SHITTY COYOTES GAME JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE PLAYOFFS!  YOU'RE A SPORTS BAR!!!!!!!  The food was okay, as usual.  However, now you have to pay extra for veggies???????????  For shit service, middle of the road wings, and a TV... I'll stay home.  Thanks Buffalo!

Love it.   I love this place, I have been here twice in the past two months on a whim without a reservation, and the place is always able to accommodate (might just be luck).   Both times I have been here I could only eat the the Vigazz Burger and the cauliflower and both times it has been fabulous.  Additionally they always separate it out for me based on my diet (super accommodating) and I immensely appreciated it the first time and it is why I will continuously return.    The waiters and waitresses have personality and are incredibly nice. The place is clean, and the parking "issue" has been ameliorated by having Valet services.  Just be prepared and bring some cash for that. :)

Just drove up during business hours, saw other cars being washed, and thought I would get a carwash... Nobody was standing where they "take your order"... Waited for 30 seconds and left... Found a better deal at Chevron giving $5 car washes with 10 cents off of your gas... Can't sustain a business when the most important person isn't there...

My FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix across the board.  Hands down, bar none, insert extraneous euphemisms here.  I shouldn't talk to much about it because I need it to remain a little secret.  P.S. Every time I go I get the Shrimp Taco and a Carne Asada Burro. That's all I'm going to say!!!  Shhh...

People... People... People...   For being an airport restaurant, Jose Roux is pretty decent. Yes the food is tasteless, but ask for more salsa before you never see your server again. No really, ask for more salsa.   The margaritas are pretty great for being airport margaritas...   I don't even remember what I had, but in all honesty, it wasn't as bad as past airport restaurants I've been to, and for that I say... Decent job... But really... Your food is bland...   GREAT ALCOHOL!!!

I definitely will be returning to this place.  The doughnuts/donuts are as good, if not better, as krispy kreme or the like.  The guy working was incredibly nice and the fact there is a drive through spells trouble. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area, for sure. : )

Next to the Federal Pizza, where I got food poisoning a month or so ago, this is the worst restaurant I have EVER been to. At least the Federal tasted good going down.  I will preface this by saying my boyfriend and I LOVE frybread and LOVE trying new things.  We arrived starving and this was JUST awful.  I got the Frybread Southwest, while my boyfriend got a Frybread with Chicken on it (can't remember which one).    I have got to be honest.  The frybread was GREAT, but everything else was a disaster.  Both of our dishes had Frybread with canned refried beans piled on top (about a centimeter or so thick) with no meat to speak of and another centimeter or so of garbage shredded lettuce.  There might have been sour cream or a topping, but all we could taste was horrible beans and trash lettuce.  How can a business sustain itself with Walmart store-bought goods? If it isn't, at least fool the customers with some quality.  I have friend's who have tried to make food for me that is absolute garbage. To be honest, I'd have those other meals instead of AZ Frybread ever again.  I hate saying this because they were so nice and welcoming.  Plus we were starving so we would have been happy with anything.  I could not have been more disappointed.  Also, the juices are SO PULPY they are almost undrinkable.  It also seems as though it is a mix of store-bought juice and someone juicing strawberries and mango's for their juices and that left a pretty horrible taste in our mouths.  We took 4-5 bites a piece, because we were starving and threw the rest away.  And if you know us, you know that we NEVER throw food away.  We always take our leftovers home.  Not this time.  Wish we had put the calories toward something actually satisfying like In-N-Out.   Sorry AZ Frybread.

I have lived in the valley for almost 8 years now, and I have always avoided going to this place.  You see, I am Italian, and I am very picky about my Italian food, and how I like it.  Luckily my Oregano's-obsessed boyfriend made me go with him to the first time ever at this location.     Now, I'm not quite sure what I thought Oregano's was (::cough:: Olive Garden ::cough::) but it id diametrically different from my assumptions.  I have heard that they have taken a ton of stuff off of the menu and for that, they have lost a star.  But in all honesty, what I had was great.  Our waiter Shawn/Sean was attentive, nice (and pretty) and laughed when we decided we wanted a deep dish pizza with 10 toppings on it.  He began to realize we were serious with all of the toppings when we didn't laugh and looked him square in the eye... He took out his pencil and paper and asked us to resume.  (That part was funnier than I've made it out to be.)  They had an okay selection of beer, but luckily a good one. He was on point with our order and let us know well in advance how long it would take to cook our monstrosity.  I appreciated the heads up as  our pizza took all of 30 minutes but for fresh, custom, deep dish pizza, it was well worth the wait.  As a woman that revels in her pizza making skills and her cooking abilities, Oregano's made a damn good pizza that day, and for that I commend them.  Just make sure to not remove anything else off the menu and we'll be good.   P.S. Th Bruschetta was ridiculous. It was so tasty, I'll probably go back to copy the recipe... YUM!

Okay, so as a meat eater I came with a TOTALLY open mind having ADORED Green off of Scottsdale Rd. I guess I was expecting a restaurant, but this is DEFINITELY more like a coffee shop or a much much worse version of Lux. My girls and I went for brunch and were very excited, unfortunately the food was NOWHERE near the caliber of what is served at Green.   My girls had some parfait thing, and a donut while I had a bagel with cream cheese and an Italian soda. My bagel and cream cheese were tasty but ABSOLUTELY bland, no chives, no onion, no nothing to spice this bad boy up. My girls said the donut was dry and revolting and the parfait was nothing she couldn't make at home with yoplait and some granola. I have been WAITING to go here with my boyfriend and decided for a sneak peak and I'm glad my boyfriend didn't come because he would have been SO disappointed. For now, only Green is on the radar. It got two stars because the girl taking our order was very gracious and sweet.  We promptly finished our food and then drove over to America's for street tacos and Vampiro's. Sorry Nami.

I will definitely return.  After leaving dog training, we smelled of Great Dane but left our dog in the car (windows down, in January) so we could enjoy this place. We were greeted by a lovely hostess/order-taker girl and I decided on the First Time while my boyfriend had the Breakfast Burrito.  He had a coffee, and I OJ.  Before sitting we asked if there was a bathroom to wash our hands as we smelled of dog.  The owner, clearly a dog lover let us wash our hands in their private bathroom in the kitchen.    (Watching people make crepes is beautiful. Like an art form)   We thank them profusely and sit down.  The food comes and both of our meals are dreams.  I will say I was not prepared for how sweet my meal would be that early in the morning, but it was so decadent and scrumptious. I might not get it again unless I'm in more of a dessert mood, but I like more savory breakfasts. There will be the sweet-toothers out there that will be titalated at the idea.  I smelled a buffalo chicken while I was there and will DEFINITELY be trying that out next time.  Now for anyone that knows me I absolutely detest eggs. I hate them and think they're gross. Then came the Crepe Bar Breakfast Burrito... ::swoon::! This is the ONLY DISH IN THE WORLD THUS FAR THAT I HAVE BEEN WILLING TO EAT WITH EGG BECAUSE IT IS SO DAMN GOOD!!!  I was actually jealous that my boyfriend had it and I didn't, since he has the sweet tooth and I die for savory.  He devoured his meal giving me a few small bites, but that thing is AMAZING!!! I might have one of my own next time dependent on whether or not the buffalo sounds better.  I love this little place, down to the art on the walls and the well decorated walls.  I even love that you pay with a Square card reader and an iPad. It feels like a pop-up art gallery.  Great vibe.  We live all the way out in Laveen, and will make a point to come here WHENEVER we can.  Thank you!!!

This is a great location and is ALMOST as good as my favorite Home Goods in the valley, over in Goodyear.  However, I can firmly say that this is a well designed location and has ample room and options.  I always walk into a Home Goods if I need to find odds and ends or if I want to burn some time.  This location is GREAT for that. :)

Okay, so I wasn't super impressed, because even though I gave it 4 stars, the food I had was lackluster.  The ambiance is great, the service was great, I wish there was a TEENSY bit more wiggle room between certain tables, but that can be forgiven.   My blasphemous move was ordering the burger. It was good, but my friend ordered the Osso Bucco, and I will regret not ordering it until I go back.  *Damn*

This place is around the corner from my office and is in a very convenient location in proximity to the Biltmore area.   I really enjoyed myself and the burger that I ordered, and based on the diet I'm on they were super accommodating separating it out for me the way that I needed it (annoying, I know, it's temporary).  The waitress was very sweet and the place was super clean.    I will be back for sure. :)

I completely agree with the other review here.  I legitimately thought it would be an Oktoberfest and not a San Tan Fest.  If it's ONLY going to be San Tan beer and sub par food if not horribly done "german food" (bratwurst ONLY) then hold it at the end of September and call it something completely different.  Omit Oktoberfest from the name, because that was NOT an Oktoberfest.  I will continue on with every other Oktoberfest in the state from now on, as I now know the quality of the San Tan Oktoberfest.  P.S. My boyfriend has been waiting to go to this Oktoberfest for 4 years and has not been able to go since he used to bartend weekends that caused him to be unable to go.  PLUS, his favorite beers on and off are the Devils Ale and the Hop Knot.  I am not going to lie, he was CRUSHED when he went to this event. He had built this up to be at least a quarter of a typical Oktoberfest in his mind, and it did not deliver at WHATSOEVER. I will not subject him to this event again and when he said he'd rather go to the ballet, he meant it.  Try again San Tan.

Wow, I could not be a bigger fan of this place.  The first time we went to this place, the ladies (owners) were so sweet.  They chatted a moment with us about their options and top sellers.  They managed our order fabulously.  I got the #35, a fabulous SW potato salad, and a dessert sandwich with nutella and powdered sugar.  ALL, and I mean ALL, of it was fabulous.  #35 is like eating a burger, but not so awful for you, the SW potato salad is not spicy but has a SW flavor that is addictive, and the nutella sandwich was SO decadent. The biggest problem is due to all of the carbs/starches, I was SUPER full, so plan on taking some home if you are a light eater. BUT, it refrigerates and microwaves well at home. (At least the #35 did). :)  The restaurant is spotless, the hand washing station is magic, and I love the recycling section of the trash cans.   This place is officially in our lunchtime rotation and I am obsessed with how sweet the ladies are that work here, they are what make the place magical.  I will definitely be back for more.

THIS IS THE EXACT COMPLAINT I FILED WITH THE BBB:  Sunday, June 30th, 2013, my boyfriend picked up our favorite pizza in the valley to eat for an early lunch, the Federal.  Immediately after eating we were both feeling a little off, slight stomach pains, a little bloated but no biggie.  We thought maybe we had over eaten.  By 8:00pm that night I ended up on the floor of my house vomiting profusely into a bowl as I could not reach the bathroom the food poisoning was so severe.    July 1, 2013, I woke up to severe dehydration, and with severe muscle and kidney pain from the extensive vomiting and other lovely experiences I had the entire night.  Unfortunately, my body had gone into such a state of dehydration, that it began to halt the function of my organs. Namely, my esophagus, my lungs, my muscles and my bladder.  Unable to walk, my boyfriend carried me to his truck and sped like a maniac to the hospital.  Arriving at the hospital, the Drs did an MRI and did not like the sound of my heart and I ended up staying in the hospital getting bags upon bags of saline to aid in my severe dehydration.   After a $300 ER bill, two missed days of work for my boyfriend (he was sick too but less so) and three missed days of work for myself, I decided to email the Federal, July 7th, 2013, after recuperating for a week.  I did not ask for compensation, I was not rude or out of line. I wrote the email coming from a concerned patron that feels that something should be done to avoid this ever happening in the future.   What I got was an email back (July 12, 2013) from a Craig Demarco, an owner of Upward Projects, who vilely requested that we handle this matter over the phone.  No problem, I understand that you do not want anything in writing for me to use against you.  Even though I expressly stated I was not out to get them, I was out to incite a change in how the restaurant serves its food.  I agreed to do so and handed over my phone number and gave some times that we could talk, and said if those times didn't work, we should coordinate a better time.   It is officially one week later (July, 19th, 2013) and no response.  Not a call, not an email, not a care. This expresses a complete lack of decorum and respect for the diners that come in to the Federal, and I cannot be less impressed with their actions.  I am disgusted with how this has been handled and really do thank them for really exhibiting how they handle delicate matters such as this.  By not handling them at all.  Update: June 19, 2014 - Nobody from this restaurant or any of the owners have contacted me about my experience.  Still no love.

Just walked through and shopped for 20-30 minutes, only to put everything I had grabbed all down the second I saw the line for the fitting rooms. Yeah right?!   High five for the elevator.  Removed for the fitting room fiasco.  You're not THAT cool H&M.

We showed up last night for a party of 15 on a cool September night without a reservation (dick I know), and they were 100% able to accommodate our party.  After we ate inside, we went out to the Yard and played ping pong forever.    Culinary Dropout is AMAZING, the food, the drinks, the service. They really try their damnedest to fulfill every need. Plus, the Yard is the best place to segway for an after party.    My biggest problem is that I have not yet tried the restaurants next to Culinary, but the entire place is amazing and a good time. Definitely check it

Wow! This place has PER-SON-NAL-I-TY!  The guys that cook, serve and own this place are REALLY nice guys, and the food is VERY authentic.  For people who have a 100% Americanized palate, it might be a tad different for your tastes, but if you like meat, no meat, hummus, no hummus, tzatziki (sp?), or veggies, you should definitely stop by.    To be honest, the food is really great, but it's the personalities of the people that work there that will keep me coming back.  I KNOW that I will leave in a good mood after having lunch there. :)

I am ALWAYS uphold, and when I decided to FINALLY pay the $50 for a car wash, nobody told me that it would take AN HOUR.  I waited for 30 minutes and then asked the ladies inside who told me it would be another 30 minutes. I was flabbergasted stating that I had no idea that it would even take 30 minutes, because I was not told.   Then they rushed the job for me (wished they should have) but then it was incomplete. Ugh.  I normally like cobblestone, but only the $5-$15 jobs.

Came in to get my fingerprints done, which I thought would take a year and a day since this location also deals with impounds. NOT SO... They have coordinated the flow of people so well that you talk to someone at a window within minutes about fingerprinting, they take debit/credit cards to pay the like $8 fee (not sure about that price, double check). Then within minutes, they take you to the back, pat you down to make sure you're not a sociopath and do your prints. It's that easy. Plus, they had wipes to clean your fingers off and I've heard of horror stories for other police departments about leaving with gummy black fingers. I will DEFINITELY be going back to this location if I need my fingerprints done for a clearance card again. : )

WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!   I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!   What are all of these people doing giving such high reviews???   Once a month, I meet up with my ladies. But after one of our foursome flaked, it was me and another femme with our name on the list for 3.  (We were waiting for drunky who probably slept in).  We went to the brand-spankin' new location which is apparently huge with a whopping 9 whole tables!!! (It could be more, but I am not exaggerating, I can only remember 9) We waited for 20 minutes in the waiting area, and our friend was still not there (suspected hangover) but they called our names and we were seated.  Our lovely young male waiter came along and we ordered drinks and told him our friend would be along at any minute.  He said no worries and would be back with our beverages.    Let me start off by saying I NEVER go to breakfast joints because I do not eat eggs.  No I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, I just hate the idea of eating a fetus.  That's all.  Unfortunately that left me with one or two options with the VERY egg heavy menu... A Waffle meal, a side order of sausage or juice.  Bring on the waffles!!!! We wait, and wait, and wait for our slacker friend for ten minutes. During the ten minutes waiting for our friend, it began to get PACKED at the front door with foodies glaring at our horrible twosome, for taking a four-top. HOW DARE WE!!!!! Don't blame us for where the hostess seated us?  After 10 minutes, the hostess walks over and asks us what the hold up is.   ?????   I'm sorry are we not shoveling down your "BIG BREAKFAST'S" fast enough for you?!  We politely stated, that our friend was going to be there any minute (she was, she was texting us that she was down the street).   THEN THE HOSTESS SAYS (verbatim): "I'm sorry we're not supposed to seat parties until everyone is here. You're going to have to order right now."  ???  Appalled, and not willing to fight, I say: "Okay, well I guess we were both getting the waffles and Britney will order when she gets here".   THE HOSTES REPLIES: "Unfortunately I'm going to have to ask you to order for her, or we wont be able to accommodate an order for your friend."  I giggled thinking she was joking.  She stared blankly at me...  WHAT??????????????  So you're telling me, that we gave you our name and our party number, 3.  You saw two of us even though your little notebook clearly said 3.  You sat us at a large table leaving the masticating buzzard hoard to wish us dead. We've been here for ten minutes when most brunch places expect you to wait at LEAST 10 minutes before ordering.  We cannot enjoy our drinks or reading the menu without feeling harassed. We have to order before our friend OR ELSE. THEN YOU TELL ME, that you will not serve a paying customer because she will order 5 minutes after us???? That's a joke right???   No joke.    (I smiled while all of this was being screamed at the hostess from my angry brain)  I tried to text Brit, but as she was parking she didn't get back to me quickly enough so we decided to order 3 Waffle breakfasts and hope Brit wasn't allergic to anything in the meal???  Luckily the second the food came out she was there and she enjoyed her waffles.  I with a bad taste in my mouth from that did not enjoy anything after that experience.  Separate and apart from the hostess being a B, the waffles were decent, but not 4.5 stars decent. I would give a solid 3 for those.  Our waiter was clearly embarrassed that we were being blamed for the hostess's mistake and told us that we should take our time and enjoy our breakfast. I wish I had gotten his name because he was the only redeeming factor for this place and why it is getting 2 stars instead of one.  He is white, skinny, 20-something and really chill and relaxed. Nice guy.    I will not be returning and will find another breakfast place just as good in Phoenix, like I have all over the valley.  Plus, with more egg-less options as well!  This place has Pizzeria Bianco syndrome where they think their food is heaven sent and give you garbage service because you should be thankful they even gave you the right to eat there.  No thank you.  The bill was appropriate, not exorbitant.  But if I want to be harassed while I eat my breakfast I'll eat with my parents.   Thanks but no thanks Matt, I wish ye well. But perhaps with a better hostess.

We had a GREAT experience. Friendly service, decent prices and a clean car.  Compared to the experience we had at Payless, I am ALWAYS excited about good service at the Sky Harbor rental area.  Plus, it was a pretty quick wait time of 5 minutes.  That ALWAYS makes me happy. :)

I COMPLETELY agree with Sue! Let me count the ways...  I began to start going to this Dr's office 4-5 years ago when they received a Top Doctors nod in the 2008 Phoenix Magazine, a nod I have not seen for them in some time. I made an appointment with Dr. Brown and was immediately pushed off onto the only Derm that seems to actually be there, Dr. Anngela Park.  I've seen her for a variety of skin issues, mole checks, acne, Accutane, etc. I have ALWAYS felt like a paycheck to the office, but didn't care because I didn't come there often.  It all started with the Accutane...  After taking Accutane for 3-4 months, I began to realized that on my 6' frame, my joints were starting to hurt.  Like, REALLY HURT.  I did some research online and saw information stating that previous people who had taken Accutane had the same results with about  half returning to normal after cessation of Acctutane, and half keeping the pain.  As a 26 year old woman with no end to the acne in sight, I decided to continue with the Accutane until the 6 month mark and stop to see if my acne had subsided and stop the pain on my joints.  I mentioned this to Dr. Park in an appointment and she made a rather blanket statement to me saying that I was wrong. No evidence, no conversation other than "I haven't seen that, so I don't agree." ?????? What???? Nothing in my life had changed, no other medications were being taken, no accidents happened, I didn't all the sudden start working out vigorously, I ate right and was doing what I had always been doing??? Being an educated young woman with a graduate degree, I hate being told that my beliefs are unfounded and are wrong, when no conversation takes place, no research is done, nothing.  If I make a statement and the Dr. says, "No, you're wrong, I haven't seen that", that REALLY bothers me.  It tells me that just because you haven't seen it, it doesn't exist to you.  Poor, poor thinking as a medical professional.   P.S. It was MOST DEFINITELY from the Accutane, and about 1.5 years later, the pain is VERY much still in my wrists at the bare minimum and I will probably have SERIOUS issues with those wrists, but I traded the pain of cystic acne for joint pain. What can you do?  Let's also state that even when I go in to see them midday on a weekday, arriving ON TIME, I ALWAYS have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes. Once I had to wait 45 minutes during a lunch break for work where I had allotted just over an hour.  Driving to there, waiting for 45 mins, waiting in the back room for 10, seeing the Dr, for 5, and and driving back cost me AN HOUR AND A HALF. BAH!!!  This place has NO regard for timeliness and I believe I see less and less patients in the waiting rooms over the years #1 because of the economy, but #2 because nobody likes bull appointment times.   The final problem was the branchial cyst on my neck.  I had a small pinhead sized mass under the skin that was NO big deal, but whenever I got sick (flu, a viral infection, etc) it would swell up to the size of a shooter marble. It had been there for two years with no problems and then it swelled and HURT, BAD.  I made an appointment to come in for the first time in like a year or so.  Waiting in the waiting room for 15 minutes, (not a patient's soul in the waiting room or in the back?). I come up to pay my specialist fee of $40 before I may enter.  A sign should hang above the door stating "Abandon all hope ye who enter here" because do NOT expect any sort of a good experience.    I went to the back and waited for another 10 minutes while I heard the Dr. talk outside my paper thin door about personal things that could have waited with no other patients there, then proceeded to debrief the intern, loudly, about me outside my door. COME IN?! I can hear you, so at least ignore me in person when you talk about me. She comes in, checks me out, and says "You're not going to like this".   DO NOT EVER START A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS IF YOU ARE A DOCTOR!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!!  My heart sinks, and she tells me... "I can't remove that, you're going to have to see a specialist". Then why, praytell, did I just pay a SPECIALIST $40 fee for you???? So basically she eludes to me to go somewhere else, I'm not getting my $40 back for her horrible advice. (Which consisted of the word "Otolaryngologist" scratched onto a piece of paper).  No names, no Dr.'s they work closely with.  Just making me pay $40 for what I could have found out online, but assumed your SPECIALISM would remove a 1cm cyst from just under the skin of my neck???  Then she proceeds to tell me that I need to see a family practice Dr. to get a referral.  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!  Continued on next review...

SECOND PART OF MY REVIEW!   I have not seen a family practice Dr. in years, because I STILL have not found a good one. Plus, if I just paid you $40, YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE YOU ARE NOW MY REFERRAL.  I go home unable to speak, FUMING.  I find a great!!! Otolaryngologist in the coming week (Dr. John Michael Raines at the Biltmore Medical Mall) and call them to make an appointment. The understanding receptionist says its fine if the Derm Dr. refers me, since they have the most recent documents about my neck.  I call the receptionist here and SHE GIVES ME ATTITUDE. (P.S. She has been working here forever and is ONLY nice when you hand her your card and ask ZERO questions). So I (nicely) continue to take no for an answer saying, I paid $40 for useless information, that I could have found out if you had told me they didn't do removal procedures, WHICH THEIR WEBSITE STATES THEY CLEARLY DO???   So I didn't accept no until the receptionist, thinking this would get me off her back, said to me, "Well you're going to have to fax us a release of information form and what to have faxed to the other office." (Didn't I sign an ROI form when you took me initially??? Isn't that mandated by HIPAA? But I digress.)  I say "Can I email the form to you as fax machines are kind of obsolete in most homes at the moment and I'd have to pay, yet again, to get this thing to you." She stated that they were not able to do that at the time, and could ONLY be faxed to them.  #1 Get with the times, #2 If you're making it complicated for me, just to get me to leave you guys alone, you have sorely misjudged me. I said fine and to expect a fax within a few hours.  I faxed the ridiculous ROI form I created with a scan of my ID, and emailed it away stating I wanted only my short history and any specific notes about this cyst sent to the new Dr.  I sent it to my Derm and only but THREE DAYS LATER, did the specialist get the faxes from Dr. Brown's office, so that I could make the appointment.  I got into the specialists appointment and he hands me a STACK of personal information from Dr. Browns office, 10-15 pages worth, telling me "I don't need this, but I'll give it to you in case you need all of that." Laughing at the misstep Dr. Browns people had made. Learn how to release information, because I'm sure TONS of people will be wanting their records sent elsewhere.   I am done.  I put up with them for making me feel like a paycheck, for dealing with a never-nice front desk lady, for making me wait 15 minutes minimum to see a Dr., for seeing the Dr. for 3-4 minutes at times, and even for making a blanket statement about my Accutane (IT'S CALLED RESEARCH!!! I don't care if you tell me it WAS the Accutane, just don't pretend it's a miracle drug with no side effects other than birth defects.)  But paying $40 for a waste of a visit and then having to waste time talking to a rude desk clerk and then spend another $5 to FAX info to them is enough. I will never be going back, I will never be giving them my money again, and I will be VERY HAPPY about it.  I would rather see ANOTHER 1 star Derm than come back here.   Sorry about my rant, I CLEARLY have pent up a little anger about this.  P.S. Dr. Raines did a BEAUTIFUL job on my cyst removal and I felt well cared for and extremely comfortable before and after surgery. I will be writing him a review when the stitches are removed and I see a little more healing. : )

As someone who avoids the dreaded work on their car as much as possible, I will say that our experiences at Discount Tire have always been top notch at every location, but this location is the bees knees.    My boyfriend and I have NEVER felt upsold, and have only felt the front end guys inform us about choices, and let us make the decisions without feeling pressured.   Plus, the guys in the shop do a BANG-UP job, compared to bad experiences we've had in the past with other places (cross threading valve caps, ugh).   I will always come to this Discount for my tire needs, because I feel COMPLETELY taken care of at this location. :)

I have never had a poor experience here and have enjoyed myself ever time.  I ADORE the local art and the food is fab.  The lounge area is cozy and the dining area is great (but they are mostly high tops).  The beer selection is not bad, and the only negative I can drum up is that I wish it was bigger.  But they truly make the most of the small space, so I'm happy.  I have been twice and would not hesitate to return. :)

While waiting for our table at Clever Koi, we came over for a drink and ended up liking our experience here , more than our experience at Koi.    The ambiance is sexy-mature, sophisticated, and the staff are knowledgable.    Thank you for the experience. :)

I have been following Stephanie for years from salon to salon, and she landed at Luxe 3 years or so ago.  I met Steph years ago when I got a HORRIBLE dye job and was looking for someone to fix my mop. She looked at me, scared for the both of us and knew exactly what to do. After a few appointments (the previous dye job was THAT bad) she made me look FABULOUS; even better than before! She's so awesome, it's been a love story ever since. If you need a peek, most of my pics are her color and cut work. (The lighter blonde pics)  I even sent my boyfriend her way a couple times to get his cut situated. He always looks amazing, but being a boy he's not as interested in driving so far (we live in Laveen) for a 30 min haircut. For me it's cathartic seeing her. I go in a visual and emotional mess and come out a beauty inside and out. Lol.   I love her, and love how sweet the front desk girls are.  It doesn't take much to impress me... but I have dealt with rude desk people, creepy hairdressers and dirty salons in the past.  I live in Laveen and drive an hour to get here because she and the salon staff are great. : ) I will always sing Luxe's praises. Just as long as she still has appointment times for me. ; )   P.S. I just came in starving and the front desk ladies offered to go pick up my food if I ordered at Famous Daves next door. THEY ARE SO SWEET!!!

A really cute place. I love that they have games and Jenga on the tables ready for you.  A friend and I had a few drinks and fries that were all pretty good.  I didn't have a lot of requirements in going, so the bar was pretty low, but I am a fan of the food that we got and the drinks that I had from the cocktail menu.   We got there at 5:00-5:30 and it was pretty busy by 6:00, so get there early if you want a booth. :)

Always amazing. Always worth it.   I have been to the Phoenix location before, but this was my first time at the Tempe location. I came here for a friend's birthday, who is clearly in college.  There were pretzels, and cheese, and ribs, and live music.   It was great.    Thanks for another awesome time Dropout! :)

Brandon was awesome! We tried to do a refi with another company before Academy and it went horribly wrong. Brandon and the team were amazing and were able to still get it done for us. Communication was on point and the whole process was super easy. Will highly recommend!

I really liked this place, a lot.   We came on a Saturday night and really enjoyed ourselves.  I had NO previous knowledge about the place and loved it.  It was like unwrapping a present, expecting "just a bar" and finding the world of food in the back.  Unfortunately most of the places were closed, so we'll have to go back during the day and when they open the other places they have slated to open in the next year.    I will return with my boyfriend for sure and will potentially give a more thorough review. (We might even have our reception here?) Stay tuned...

So I liked this place. It is above average, but definitely not my idea of amazing.   The burger was great, the fries were good, and the margarita was crap.   I don't remember what burger I got because it was devoured.  The fries were good, but in general I prefer a thicker fry (meh).   The problem I had was with the drink.  I had a margarita that was INCREDIBLY BORING. No pizzaz, just blah.  The salt on my rim was gone immediately for some semblance of flavor.    Other than that, it was decent. :)

Wow, they did a pretty amazing job with our new car.  So we just picked up our new (used) Hybrid this morning and it had been "dealer cleaned" but we wanted to get it DEEP CLEANED. So I suggested we drop off the car at this local car wash for a intense clean.   So we did the $250 cleaning for $100, plus a couple free car washes (worth it for us!). The only negative is that it took 5 hours or so when we were quoted 3 hours (plan accordingly!) This thing has come out as pristine as it is going to get for being used, and it looks great.   I definitely recommend the deep clean, minus the length of time. :)
