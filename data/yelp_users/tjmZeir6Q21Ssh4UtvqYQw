Best sushi in scottsdale hands down. Really fresh fish. Try the spicy mussels...they're amazing. The only bummer is they don't have a full bar. If they did it would get 5 stars.

I haven't been too many different indian restaurants, but food here is always good. I've never been disappointed. I get take out here at least 2-3 times/month. Their garlic naan is really good. They have a nice little patio as well if you're dining in.

Herb box is one of my favorite places! The restaurant is super cute and the food is really good. They use quality ingredients and their dishes are creative. Highly recommend the sweet potato tacos. It's also one of my go-to places for brunch. They're brunch is pretty popular. I recommend making reservations for brunch, but you can generally get in pretty quick for dinner. They also have a little market where you get delicious food to go.

Food here is always really good. You can tell they use quality ingredients. I haven't had anything I haven't liked. Service and atmosphere is also really good. My personal favorites are the smoked salmon and the shrimp po-boy. If you're a gin fan, I recommend trying their gimlet!

We go here a lot based on convenience. Take out only. Their food is ok. Can be inconsistent. But they're down the street and good if you don't have time to make dinner.

Food is inconsistent. I'll order shrimp curry one time and get a lot of shrimp and then another time and get two. Same with amount of veggies. Food is generally good if you live close, but sometimes you'll get a bad batch.
