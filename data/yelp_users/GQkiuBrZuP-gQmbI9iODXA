If I could give a negative star or no star I would. We trusted these inept people with the life of our family pet. After less than 24 hours our dog was dead. The bs story we are being told is that our 14lb dachawawa scaled an 8ft chain link fence then ran away  and jumped another fence ran onto the highway and was hit a car. All while they were desperately trying to get her back... Cough...  Liars. There is no way this story is true. Don't trust these liars and dog murderers.

I found this place by chance on a Sunday. I hadn't had my hair cut for 8 months due to my past stylist of 15 years moving. I'm so happy Chris knew exactly what I wanted, it was crazy after 3 minutes we were finishing each others sentences. Great place look for the signs it's on the second story. I'll be coming back for years to come!!!
