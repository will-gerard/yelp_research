Not happy at all and definitely not coming back. My colleague and I met for a business lunch here and sat at a high top table near the bar. We let our waiter know that we were in a bit of a rush. Even to get our waters took a long time. I ordered the fish tacos and they were yuck. I was definitely not impressed at all. Aside for my plate taking 40 minutes to get served, it was cold. We paid and immediately left hungry.

I come here weekly for our taco Tuesday nights. The carne preparada is lean and tasty. Just put on the grill and serve. You can't go wrong with the freshly made corn and flour tortillas. I've even bought their salsas and creamy guacamole. Their vegetables are fresh and cheap! We fed a party of 25 for less than $60. It was a huge taco fest at our house and everyone raved of all the yummy flavor. Thank you Ranch Market!

Ahhhmazeballs! My favorite red and green chilli burritos in town. Fresh, spicy, flavorful, and their tortillas are soft and homemade. I've bought 8 one day and shared them with my coworkers. Their taste buds were also in heaven. There is a reason why this place has been in business for so long!  Go there today!

My favorite lunch spot! We try to come here on Tuesdays for a quick and delicious bite. They usually have tacos and pozole on special and every bite is worth it. January at the bar is always very attentive and happy. I recommend coming here for their green chili, tacos, nachos, wings... You name it!

I've been craving ramen and yelp had lead me to this place. I'm glad it did. I came here for lunch and had their ramen and California roll lunch special. The ramen soup was so flavorful and perfectly cooked! I'm still craving it right now. The California roll was fresh and a great portion as well. I can't wait to come back and try more things on their lunch menu but you better bet I'll be ordering that ramen lunch special sooner than later!

I became a huge Richardsons fan since the first day I ate there back in 1998. I've been a follower of all his food/restaurant concepts throughout all these years. I love going to Rokerij's dimly lit bar in the basement on a Sunday morning while devouring my Enchiladas and Eggs. I always get the same dish every time, but its like a party in my mouth with every bite. I've also come here for their great happy hour specials. How can anyone pass up $5 small dishes, which honestly are not small at all. No one will ever be disappointed with the outstanding customer service, food, drinks, and cozy environment that Rokerij has to offer.   P.S. Remember to always make reservations for diner.

You will definitely find fresh homemade pasta here. This restaurant is beautiful with a very intimate setting. I had their pasta special and it was outstanding. I paired my meal with their Italian red wine. Yum yum.

Yes, yes, yes! Everyone of the ladies that work here are beyond professional and know their stuff.  I am new to this whole wedding thing and thought I would go in and do a quick alteration to the dress and just be finished. Boy, was I in for a surprise when I called in to make my appointment and the lady on the phone said "oh hun, you need do start doing a dress fitting like 3 months prior". WHAT! No need to worry. These amazing ladies got me in pretty quickly and had me come back every 2/3 weeks for my fittings. Everything they did to my dress was beautiful and professionally detailed. I highly recommend coming here. They are priced very reasonably and  go above and beyond to make the bride feel stress free for the BIG DAY!

I'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal, but this place is top notch not only in service, but as well as quality of food. The fillet mijon was tasty, perfectly cooked (medium), and still sizzling hot on my plate. We ordered mac and cheese, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus for sides. Again, I cannot express the 5 star quality of food this place serves. To end our evening off, we ordered the chocolate lava cake. I'm don't have a sweet tooth whatsoever, but to see the hot chocolate oozing out of the middle of the cake with vanilla bean ice cream. WOW, my taste buds were in heaven. I will be coming back to this place sooner rather than later. Get the lava cake ready for me! This time I will make room to fit it all in my tummy.

This place deserves all of the stars and much much more! I love the hillstone group and all of its restaurants. I first stepped into a Houston's in 1998 (ya, I'm aging myself)! Everything here is phenomenal! From all their appetizers and dinner plates I have been extremely happy with each and every order. Service here is immaculate and on point. I will always come back and bring friends here for an outstanding good time.

Good ole Randy's serves a good ole breakfast. I've lived in Scottsdale for more than ten years and not once have I came here although I shopped in this strip mall many times. My husband and I ordered the chicken fried steak, two eggs, toast, and a side of bacon! Everything was good and we were happy with the result. This is a quick diner type restaurant so don't come here for the fluff! Ps- cash only!

I've stopped by here once after I got done grocery shopping. I read the reviews and anxiously wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Casella's Italian Sub and for some reason it did not live up to what I have read in all the other reviews. Maybe Casella's was having an off day.   I am not marking it off from my list yet. I guess i will give Casella's another try. Hopefully it won't disappoint.

I love love this Safeway. I live close by and come here on a weekly basis to get anything I could possibly want. Wines from local Arizona wineries... Check Fresh pastries/cakes made by the talented Frida... Check No one knows meats and fish like Curtis who is always happy to help... Check.  Their flower selection is always fresh. There is a reason why I never go elsewhere.

The bakery in this Safeway is top notch!!! I ordered three different types of birthday cakes for all of my family's birthdays that fall in January. My baby niece got her mini smash cake with delicious fresh fruit on top, my mom got the strawberry shortcake, and I got the Boston cream cake. Every single one was such a great hit, fresh, fluffy, and tasty!! I received so many compliment from many of our guests on the strawberry shortcake that I already have a few requests to buy this type of cake for future birthdays! Everyone at this baker is so helpful and the prices are so reasonable. Thank you Safeway!!!

This review is mostly for the bartender Sara! You made our night! It was a busy Thursday night and we called ahead to make sure this location had the mega touch game. Sara greeted us with a smile and quickly poured out drinks. She took our order and everything was done exactly as we wanted: cheese sticks, wings, fries, etc. Sara was on point on everything. Thank you so much and we will definitely be back!

Who in their right mind seriously likes going to the dentist? Not I. But after trying to find a dentist after our family dentist retired it was hard work. Some friends recommended that I go to Dr. George Carr, and so I did.  From the phone call when making my appointment to even getting my wisdom teeth extracted, I have been impressed by the high level of professionalism that comes from that team. Everyone there is friendly, attended to my comfort level, and even provided a follow up call to see how I was doing after the service was conducted.  The cleanings are very detailed and use the newest technology.   I've never felt this much at ease when going to the dentist.   A huge thank you to Dr. Carr and his incredible team!

Right on the corner of Roosevelt and 7th street is where this little hole in the wall stands. If you blink.. Well you might pass it. El Norteno has the best green and red chili burros! Hands down! I always get a few orders to go because coming from Scottsdale is quite out of the way... So I usually order 3 green and 3 red! For Christmas Eve, I get a few pints of their green chili to serve piping hot to the family and boy do they love it! They always ask me where I got it, but this secret is safe with me.

I gave this place a try two times. Both times I've been very disappointed  on the quality if the food and their extremely slow service. The food made my tummy ache all day after I returned back to the office.  Unfortunately I will no longer return. Sorry la Paloma, I really wanted this to be my near neighborhood Mexican spot

Absolutely delish! This is a quick, easy, flavorful, and easy on the wallet lunch spot. Their food is always very tasty and consistent. I've ordered a variety  of their dishes and all of them always beyond expectations.  If you like super spicy salsa.. You have to ask them for it. I can only drop a couple drops if it because it's like fire.. But good.

Oh Pizza Mart. You were our go to place when I was a little girl growing up in Mesa. How can you beat the delicious CHEAP large pepperoni pizzas for $3.75 (back in the '80's and '90's). Then a 10 cent ice cream cone. You had the best old school video games ever. You are a true Mesa landmark!

After week of coordinating with a newly created yelp - foodie group, we decided that our first visit will be at Cowboy Ciao. I haven't been to CC for over 10 years, and I am glad I came back. Our server, Nancy was amazing, funny, and on point at all times. She did mention it was restaurant week, but we mentioned her what we were there for and she had some recommendations for us. Our group shared the truffle mac and cheese, mushroom pan fry, pork chop, pork belly, and the flat iron steak. Nancy was very diligent making sure we pair our food perfectly. First came out the pork belly and the truffle mac and cheese. Every bite was delicious and went well with each other. Second came our main plates: flat iron steak, pork chops, and the mushrooms. I would go back just for the mushrooms alone and the sauce.   I decided to wash down this decadent food with the wine flight CC was offering.   I would definitely recommend this place for an intimate date night. You cannot go wrong.  And a huge thanks to our server Nancy!!!

My favorite happy hour spot... And my cousin agrees! We have come here several times for their fabulous kettle chilli verde pork and martinis. Both of these items are on the happy hour menu. Other favorites are the flatbread, big ass burger (yes it's ginormous), and their amazing fish tacos.  My best friend loves their huckleberry margaritas. I've been coming to this place for happy hour for the past 7 years and will be a continuing customer because of their delectable and affordable bites. Thank you RF!

Great bang for your buck. I was a first time customer there and got 50% off my entire dry cleaning bill. Now that's a bargain. Shirts and pants were dry cleaned nicely without any complaints. This will be my dry cleaning spot from now on since it's very affordable, close to home, same day service,and they do a pretty decent job.

I'm the kind of gal that needs greasy, cheesy, spicy, yummy goodness after a rough night out. Los betos has been my go to spot for the right kind of cure. My favorite burrito is the California burrito, no pico de gallo, add beans. I order this every time and it does it's trick. I recommend you get this burrito and you'll never go back to a different kind of burrito.

This place has the best dish of all time... Blue corn enchiladas. You can never go wrong when ordering this delicious treat. I've come to Carlsbad many many times and I always order the same dish. The food is consistent and the patio is perfect for date night. Be careful when sitting outside when it's hot out because of the Mosquitos. Those lil suckers bite me every time. You can subside the annoying pain with more margaritas.

My favorite Zipps location out of all of them. They always get my order done correctly and takeout is always piping hot when I take it home. Their wings are their go to staple, delicious, flavorful, and I love them extra crispy. Another favorite item of mine is their mozzarella sticks. This spot is great to watch any sports either indoors or out in their large patio.

Can I say... Yes Please! I recently came here for din din and I do to know why I don't come back here often! Wow! My buddy from Chicago has heard a great deal about the baseball history this place holds and the food so we decided to give it a go. We came here and ordered the calamari, ribeye with horse radish, and ribs. Ohhhh em gee. Everything was savory and cooked to perfection. My martini was okay, but who cares when the food was what we came here for. Their customer service was on point. Since I live walking distance to this place, I will be coming back sooner than you think.

This place is now my go to Italian spot. Huge servings, fresh pasta, and priced just great.  I've sat at the bar on several occasions and had the short rib, the stuffed cap mushrooms, NY Strip steak and their freshly toasted garlic bread. All of it was a carb feast but loved every bite.  I will definitely go back often. I even took my parents here and they agreed with my review. You will too!

It cannot get better than this! My boyfriend and I come here about once a week and sit up at the bar. Our bartender Johnny already has our drink prepared before we sit down. Yes, we are regulars... And so are many other customers who come here. Johnny is the most amazing bartender and best customer service there is. Thank you uncle sals and Johnny for making our dining experience feel like home every time.

After reading my friends happy hour review on this place I decided to give it a try. I've been here once many years ago for dinner, but never for happy hour. They have a great menu and the dishes are generous portions so that you can share. I had the mussels...and wow..delicious. Wine is $5/a glass, and ever $2.50 drafts. Let's just say I left a happy girl and will be returning here on a regular basis.

My fiancé surprised me with a date night here. Todd was our spectacular waiter and had everything we ordered come out to perfection. I ordered the Chefs Special which was the BLT salad, filet mijon with shrimp, and green beans for the side. I didn't know I was hungry, but I finished every bite.  The cucumber ranch dressing that came with the salad was so amazing, creamy, and fresh!  We had plenty of left overs that were packed up for another amazing dinner tomorrow.  Thank you Todd for making our evening very special!

This place is for seafood lovers. Best happy hour prices for the freshest seafood around. I've come here a few times with the bf and we love ordering a dozen oysters , little neck clams, rockafellar oysters, and San Remo with a side of their bread. Everything is so tasty. We enjoy sitting belli up at the bar while sipping on martinis.  Note- this place does get pretty packed for happy hour.. Specially during the weekend. Well worth every bite!

I kick myself in the butt for not coming here sooner. My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner since I love BYOB restaurants. This place is small (about 10 tables) and have a three course meal for $60! I ordered the foie gras for the first course and it was melt in your mouth good. For the 2nd course I had the hand made tortellini. I could have licked my plate clean. For the third and final course I ordered the Grouper and my husband had the Wagu Hanger steak with Peruvian purple potatoes. Everything was so fresh and decadent! We have decided to come here more often and try new things they offer. Their menu changes weekly so it keeps it very exciting. Reservations are a must!

I've been a fan of Cafe Boa since it was located in a small cozy spot on Mill Avenue right by the old Long Wongs. After all the years of popularity and craze, I am happy to see it grow into a larger location and add an East Mesa location to its family. I was sad to see the old menu go, since my favorite dish "El Greco" is no longer on the new menu. I still come here to explore new dishes. Every ingredient is fresh and every bite is flavorful.  I will definitely be back again, and again!

I love bringing friends and out of town guests to AZ88. It has such an excellent vibe, stiff drinks, mouthwatering food, and great beats. I always start with a dirty martini and older the Hell Fries. Every bite is special! After dinner, I go for round two and order the espresso martini.  Now, lets not forget about all the talk about the secret bathrooms. Basically push the door and enter at your own risk! You will see angles of yourself you've never seen before. It's always great laughter to see what your guests say about their experience.   A must go to for date night or night out with loved ones.

By far my favorite pizza in AZ. For many years I have been coming here and ordering the roasted corn pizza and gladiator. I've tried a few of their sandwiches but I always need to get my sourdough crust pizza fix with fresh ingredients. This is such a great Arcadia staple and have introduced a lot of people to this place. Parking is the only thing that gets me in a tizzy. Another thing is that they do not start baking pizzas until after 4pm during the weekday.

Just simply the best home made pasta ever. No wonder this establishment has been a staple in the camelback corridor/biltmore area for such a long time.  We went there to try out #arizonarestauranteeek! I decided to opt out from the set menu and order the black fettuccini since I'm obsessed with squid in pasta. I'm so happy I did. My dish was full of rich flavor. My boyfriend ordered the three course restaurant week special and loved the sea food pasta with sea bass. We couldn't finish our delicious plates and rolled out of tomasos with big big smiles. Thank you tomasos for your delicious pasta dishes!

He had the filet ravioli and I had the pasta platter with a variety of three different raviolis. Everything was cooked to perfection and service was on point with a smile. I can't wait to come back here again and devour their tasty, creamy, flavorful dishes. Yes.. It's on the pricey side.. But worth every bite. We left with our bellies full and happy. Thank you Tomasos for being an Italian staple to Phoenix!

The best macaroons I've ever had! Hey, when this girl gets a craving, I will go anywhere just to get the best... And the best I did get! I am a huge fan of macaroons (vanilla bean is my fave), and I have been to many places... But this place has the best. When I got there, the place was packed with people eating their delicious breakfasts, but my tummy was only focus on their macaroons. I ordered three and ran to my car to scarf one down. It immediacy satisfied my craving and put a big smile on my face. I am definitely coming back!

You can never go wrong in going to the original VIG! I used to come here for 1/2 priced bottles of wine on Sundays... But now they have a twenty-two Tuesday special. You get a bottle of wine and one of their delicious apps for only $22. That's a steal! You can order their cheesy Tatter tots or get their trifecta hummus. All the apps are made to share and delectable in every bite. Their patio is perfect for a large party to sit next to the fireplace (we had 8 of us). This place will be my go to place for Tuesday Hh with the girls!

Amazingly delicious. I am not a club person, nor like to dance...but eating and being a foodie is in its own level and this place does not disappoint. Thank you to Christopher, the bartender who made my experience memorable. My friend and I started with the foie gras. It was such a decadent piece, a little more on the sweet side since it was served with a grilled pineapple. We then decided to order their Filet Carpaccio with the french fires served 3 ways. Everything was worth every bite. Although, this place was a little on the pricey side, how can you get mad when you are in Vegas! I will be bringing my husband here with me on our foodie fest. Thank you!

The bf and I have come here twice in one month. Both of these times the sashimi is fresh and the rolls are spectacular! Our go to roll is the Dozo roll. Reason for 4 stars is that sometimes the service is just too slow. We usually sit belly up at the sushi bar for faster service... But it is still not lightening speed. All in all, great sushi, local spot, zero pretentiousness, decent prices. You cannot go wrong!

I really wanted to love it after reading all the wonderful reviews, but unfortunately, it didn't hit my wow factor!  I ordered the California club for my hubby and I got the oatmeal with all the yummy fruit. All in all, after having to wait twenty minutes in that long line of cars I wouldn't go back. Sorry D'lish. You didn't make my breakfast roster.

If I can add more than 5 stars.. I definitely would. I've used other carpet cleaning services before but this company is worth every penny and so much more. My boyfriend and I just recently moved in together and I got tired of looking at all the couch and carpet stains. I called this carpet cleaning company and they were able to fite in right away. After two solid hours of carpet, rug, and upholstery cleaning.. Everything looked brand new. Not one wine nor pet stain( we have two dogs). They are punctual, detailed, and made sure you were happy with the results. My boyfriend came home and couldn't believe his eyes of the cleanliness!  I highly recommend them and I will be using them again.

PHONTASTIC! Best PHO in Scottsdale.. Hands down. I've come here a few times with my dad for lunch and we are absolutely obsessed! I love the family style customer service and the food and pho are so fresh. The owner remembers us every time we stop in (about once a week) and always makes sure we are happy with our order. Of course we are happy when our tummy is filled with yummy Vietnamese goodness!  This place gets packed for lunch but once you try it you will always come back.

Hello yummy burger goddess! I think I finally went to burger and Tatter tot heaven. I ordered their original 3oz burger and it was like a party in my mouth. The Tatter tots were so crispy and cooked to perfection. They also came with a variety of dipping sauces. My hot plus one ordered the short rib burger and wants to come back for more.  If you are looking for burger perfection, then this will be your go to place! I can't wait to come back and try more burgers on their menu!

Who would have known that in the middle of Tempe there is a great Sushi place. My hubby and I decided to come here on Sunday night for a quick happy hour. We started off with the soft shell crab. Although, I thought it was a little too greasy, by hubby loved every bite. I ordered the salmon sashimi and their house salad. Everything that came out tasted fresh. One of the guys making our sushi asked if we ever tried the fresh wasabi with no horseradish paste. Huh? There is such a thing? I am so glad we tried it because it gave everything we ordered extra flare.  We will be coming back more often and possibly become regulars.

Superb and two thumbs up! Every bite was delicious. We came here to celebrate our engagement and we were treated like royals! Dirty Martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives... Yum! Pretzel bread.. Get in my belly. We love ordering the decadent crab gnocchi, green beans with almonds, asparagus, oysters... You name it and they will blow your socks off. This place is a carnivore's dream! Filet for me and a bone in filet for the hubby! Can't wait to come back.. Oh.. And always order the butter cake.

"Z" is my number one happy hour spot!! Every time I go (and I go quite a bit), I come home a happy girl...that's what happy hour is all about right? From their chips and salsa to their MARGARITAS. One of those Chamboard Margs and I'm on cloud nine regardless of how my work week has been. Thanks Z for being my #1 HH spot for so many years.

This is definitely a neighborhood bar/dine in spot. Everyone knows everyone here. It's a cozy place to grab a bite with friends. We've ordered the Greek Pizza and had hot dogs for the kiddos. Everything was great and extremely affordable. Since its a sister restaurant to one of my favorite Italian Spots (uncle sals) I'll definitely be back. Amazing customer service.

They have great sushi that is served to perfection. And lets not forget the DJ. Love the DJ. Bring your friends, get some Saki, and enjoy the last day of the weekend.

It's been over 10 years since either my hubby or I have stepped foot inside a Red Lobster. On this day, I was craving their cheesy bread and the hubby wanted Maine Lobster. We bellied up at the bar and our waitress Sherry was AMAZING!! She gave us her recommendations for dinner and I am so happy we took it. The Maine Lobster was cooked perfectly and my hubby was good. I had the ceasar salad and the Bar Harbor Bake. The food was great and we where very surprised on why we haven't come to Red Lobster a long time ago. We will definitely come back, but definitely request Sherry to be our server. She goes above and beyond to give you an amazing dining experience with a smile.  Thank you Red Lobster and a big thank you to Sherry.

Oh La Bocca how I enjoy coming here. There is no place like it on Mill Ave. Every time I come here I love sharing the antipasto platter. The hot/spicy mustard is my favorite. It definitely has a kick to it. After washing all that deliciousness down with a few glasses a wine then order the truffle mushroom pizza. You definitely can't go wrong with anything you order here.

My hubby has come here for many years to get his haircut and I heard great things about it from a few girls at work. I was in desperate need of a haircut and I decided to walk right in in. Jessica was awesome and I was so impressed. She cut off more than 2 inches and did an amazing face framing job .. All for about $16! I could t believe the price. It was awesome. I left a very happy customer and will definitely be back to see her.

Delicious! My hubby and I come here quite often and we have become big fans! We always order the French onion soup? Iceberg Wedge salad, filet mijon, and their famous twice baked potato! Their food is always cooked to perfection and it always comes out very tasty. Their happy hour is great as well. I highly recommend this place!

My hubby and I are huge fans of this gyro place. We have even turned our friends into coming here often. All their gyro sandwiches are amazing and extremely tasty. Their side salad is fresh and the french fries are seasoned perfectly.  There is always a little wait since everything is made to order, but we always call in before heading there.  Thank goodness this place is close to home and we order take out from here a few times a month! YUMMY!! You will not be disappointed.

This is a classy place to have a business lunch. You can't beat their $9 lunch specials. The few times I've visited this location with my colleagues the food was good but not amazing. It lacks the Great quick service to fit in your one hour lunch schedule. Every time I've been here i feel like I'm waiving down the waiter/waitress for the status on the food, refill on drinks, or even try to pay the bill. I want to give it one more try, but we will see since my colleagues were also disappointed.

Wow! This was our first time ordering takeout from here and we were beyond impressed. This place is a small Thai place that makes amazing dishes. We ordered the chicken pad Thai a little spicy and the Tom Kha soup with shrimp. My hubby wasn't feeling good and the soup definitely lifted his spirits. He said it was a very very tasty soup. I can't wait to come back and order the wonton soup (one of my favorite Thai soups) and Kung Pao dish in beef.  Thank you so much La Thai! We are going to be coming back a lot more often now

this nail salon. This has been my go to nail salon for the past few years and every time I go somewhere else I end up regretting it. Their gel manis always last longer than any other place I've gotten them done at and their pedicures are always done perfectly! I've even gotten my eyebrows and upper lip waxed here when I come in. Definitely my one stop shop. I can't wait to try their eye lash extensions. I hope it's as good at any other service they have provided for me in the past.

Not bad, yet not too impressed to be coming back. We came here for happy hour and sat belly up at the bar. We ordered from a few items on the menu as well as the happy hour menu. The fried rice was way to greasy and salty for my taste. We also ordered the oysters and they tasted okay but had a little fishy after taste. The service was  not bad at all, but I wanted this sushi joint to make my taste buds dance and unfortunately it didn't accomplish that. Sorry Sushi Roku, we won't be coming back.

Cafe Monarch is a hidden gem. Coming here is just not like any restaurant where you order something from a menu. This is a genuine eating experience. Chef Chris is a one man show and treats each guest with care. He is a distinct artist when in comes to preparing dishes that will satisfy each distinct palate. I have come here for dinner and lunch, and yet have to try one of his Sunday Barbecue brunches.  Remember, this place is BYOB (beer and wine) and only takes cash. Every bite is worth every penny.   Thank you Chris for your hospitality.

I came back here again for my birthday dinner. This is the first time I've been back since they have redone the back patio renovations and I'm glad we did. The environment oozes romance. The food was exquisite and service impeccable. I wish they still had the BYOB option (corking fee applies) because I had tasteful bottles of wine I would have loved to pair my meal with.  My date loved it too. I will definitely be back with my plus one.

I crave the Mission daily! I have been quite a regular of this unique Latin American restaurant and cannot wait to go back and experience more dishes. I enjoy starting with the Cheese Plate. Let me tell you, this is no ordinary cheese plate. The dish is a mixture of Yucca bread, Peruvian aji, apples with warm honey, and more. Extremely tasty. I enjoyed the Almejas al Vapor (Peruvian seafood stew), skirt steak tacos, and now my new favorite pollo a la brasa. The chicken is marinated in red aji rocotto (spicy) and served on top of a mixture of french fries and sweet potato fries.   The entire staff here is always knowledgeable and will make the best recommendation. Thank you Brian, one of the owners, for always making myself and my guests feel welcome.

I really really have been wanting to try this place for such a long time now since I am a really big fan of Karl Kopp's AZ88 in Scottsdale. The department store history and feel is definitely there but it lacked the food flavor and martini pizzaz! I ordered a dirty martini and it was ok. Nothing too great. My hubby and I shared the cauliflower plate and the pepperoni and onion pizza... I wanted to be wowed like I am at the sister restaurant but unfortunately everything fell flat! The only thing exciting that brought goose bumps  was the dolls in the basement! It made the small hairs in the back of my neck stand!  Our date night ended quickly after that! Sorry Hannys, we won't be coming back!

This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.

We came here on a night in search for desert. When Blanco's first opened up they had the most amazing, flavorful, savory tres Leches cake. I would even hop on by and order it for take out because it was so delish. Since I sold my date on this cake we walked on over and were disappointed to hear they no longer carried it on the menu. WHAAAAT!  We settled for the sopapillas but to be honest they lacked the pizzaz. Won't go back to Blanco's for desert.. But will just for a margarita!

My friend surprised me and took me here for a delicious dinner. The Phoenician grounds are classy and beautiful. Our table was right by a window were we watched the gorgeous Phoenix sunset. I ordered the filet mijon accompanied with a baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. We also ate gruyere cheese stuffed little fried balls with black truffle compliments of the chef. Boy, do I love black truffle. The company, food, service, and grounds were nothing but perfection.  I highly recommend this place for a romantic date night.

Thank you for making my chihuahua look like a handsome boy. I had petsmart do a pawdicure plus on him before the holidays and boy did they clean him up very nicely. The groomers have great attention to detail and make your pet feel comfortable. I will definitely be bringing him back for an upkeep!

This place is a little hole in the wall who serves the best pho. The environment is very simple, but you will be impressed on why this spot is completely packed during lunch hours. Their food is tasty, flavorful, and it comes at a cheap price ($4-7 per gigantic bowl of pho). This location also got featured in Phoenix Magazine (July 2012) Cheap Eats across the valley! Check them out!!!

This place may not be the authentic Chinese food that you are looking for but hey.. It's pretty darn delicious. My boyfriend and I came here to dine before the Billy Ocean concert. Our bartender Theresa took immediate care of us knowing that we were pressed for time. She was knowledgeable and helped us pick our tasty dishes. We had the uncles fried rice with shrimp and Mongolian beef with a side of noodles. We haven't been to their Scottsdale location in years but now we are planning to visit it soon with friends to try out new dishes. Thank you!

I've come here a few times with my hubby, as well as some friends. Unfortunately, this place did not hold the WOW factor for me to want to come back. My friend ordered their fried chicken plate and I had their bruschetta. The bread in their bruschetta was a little tough, somewhat stale. While my friend was not impressed with the chicken dish. From now on, I will have to say Pass!

I was craving street tacos and this place is as close to the street tacos you will get in Rocky Point. It's a small quaint place but they have such a variety of different salsas I didn't even know existed. The corn tortillas were fresh and the carne asada tacos were extremely on point.  I'll be coming back here sooner than you think just to get my taco fix!

This place is just okay for me. I am not the kind of person who likes loud bars, loud music, and it's extremely packed. The bathrooms where also a huge mess. Maybe I've came at a bad day (aka spring training)... But again, not my cup of tea. I've had their ahi tacos and was hoping to get a real size taco and not a few very small tacos with no tortilla. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back here in the future.

I came here about a month ago to celebrate my friends birthday and boy was it packed. We forgot to make reservations and had about a 25 minute wait (not bad for a Saturday night). Our mouths kept watering when we watched the cooks make every pizza. We ordered two pizzas and a salad for a party of four. We immediately dug in! The salad was ok, nothing special. The pizzas definitely gave competition to the other pizza restaurants in the valley. The crust was perfectly cook, fresh ingredients, amazing cheeses. Every bite was flavorful. I definitely have to come back for more.

When I get donuts for he office.. This place is definitely my go to. Everyone at the office loves the succulent, fluffy, soft, warm, and tasty donuts from here. I even get certain requests from team members on the type of donut flavor they would like. I highly recommend the glazed and chocolate sprinkled donuts. They are my top two favorites. My hubs did order their breakfast croissant sandwiches a few times and loved every bite!

Who would have thought that this gem would be hidden inside the Talking Stick Casino. It was a chilli and rainy evening and my husband was craving crawfish etouffee. I've rarely had Louisiana style cooking so I was ready to go. I was super happy we came here. We ordered a shrimp cocktail to share and the combo etouffee. WOW WOW WOW. It was so spicy and we ordered level 3 spicy. Everything though was super fresh and tasty. We sat belli up and the bar to see them make our dishes with their fresh spices.   Husband was super full and happy and he said this restaurant made our roster. This means we will be coming back a lot sooner for some more yummy goodness.

The closest thing to Mama's home cooking and if you know how good my mama cooks... Well, the woman can cook! Their ceviche is big with fresh seafood. The lomo Saltado comes in a big plate and worth every bite. The only thing I'm not a fan of is that they do not serve Peruvian beer here. I crave a cold glass of cuzquena beer with this appetizing meal. All in all this place is a must try!

For the ULTIMATE sports bar experience, Blue 32 is my go to spot. Located on Scottsdale Road just south of Indian Bend, Blue 32 offers an upscale sports bar environment, food, and service. There are flat screen TVs all over the place with outstanding surround sound system. They have a beautiful marble bar top, and classy furnishings throughout the place.  The food here is better quality than your usual wings and burgers you might get down the street at any other bar. The nachos are packed real high with cheese, chicken, salsa...ohhhh, just name it and they will throw it on there.  This is my go-to place to watch football or any other sporting event that might be on.  Thanks Blue 32 for opening doors in my neighborhood!

This place has my favorite cupcake of all time. The salted caramel vanilla cupcake always puts a gigantic smile on my face. I've also tried the red velvet and the Oreo cupcakes but nothing is better than the salted caramel. It has a mix of salty-sweet frosting in a warm moist vanilla cake. Every bite is heavenly. If you ever want to make someone's day... Get them one of these.

I came here with a great group of friends for a Sunday Dinner / Birthday Dinner. When I see the name "Steak House", my mouth immediately salivates because I am thinking of steak houses like Mastros City Hall, Flemings, etc.  Unfortunately, this steak house is not even up to par. The food was very meh...nothing to get excited about. The service...horrible. It took over one hour just for us to get the food. We kept looking around the restaurant which was not even busy on a late Sunday afternoon for our waiter and he was no where to be found.  All in all, don't waste your time here. The steak at Outback is better and cheaper.

My out of town friends decided to get a lil fancy schmancy and reserve the private room for din din. I've been to the restaurant area before but never to this private room. The scenery of this room pulled all stops with beautiful chandeliers, dim lighting, and even your private bar with your own private bartender.  For appetizers we ordered the fondue to share and it was the most creamiest, tastiest fondue ever made. Yes, I'm still craving it. I ordered the pan seared scallops which was cooked to perfection. We spent A long time enjoying the evening with our group and didn't feel rushed.  This place is a must for date night and must make reservations ahead. Everything was just fabulous.

Yes yes yes. I've come here a few times to get my pampered and the results are amazing. Their hourly price is such a great deal and I have even done the 90 min. Everyone that has massaged me has been trained and I come out feeling relieved and relaxed. The establishment is always clean and they definitely take great care of their customers. I will be a regular here since it is so affordable.  Thank you Thai Foot Massage for making me feel relaxed again.

Pretty darn good for a company lunch spot. We had a big group of about 14 employees come here during the busy lunch hours. Our server was quick, witty, and definitely knew how to describe everything on the menu. Must have aps are pretzels and cheese fondue plus the crispy shrimp. I ordered the butternut squash tortellini. Wow! It's was so flavorful and buttery! I am still dreaming of this dish. I highly recommend on coming back here to try their happy hour specials. Thanks Mr. Fox for another restaurant concept that I highly enjoyed.

Simply THE BEST!  Do you want your coworkers to give you happy high fives... Well this is the place to go in order to out smiles on their faces. I often pick up a few dozen for my employees birthdays. Let me tell you they are a huge hit! Even the CEO and CFO of the company come by just to grab a warm, gooey, delectable donut once they see me carry in the white boxes in. Their original glazed donuts are everyone's absolute favorite.   This place has become my entire departments favorite donut shop. Go, run, dash there and grab some to go!

I am so happy I found this place. I've been craving good Thai Food and I was happy this location is close to work. I walked in around 11:30am and the restaurant was filled up with hungry folks. I ordered the Pork Peanut Panang and was super happy with the dish. Everything was tasty and their side house soup was very flavorful. I recruited some of my work buddies to come back with me for another Thai lunch!!  You have made my lunch roster!!!

I highly depend on Euro Wax Salon! I buy their waxing packages and wax all year long. My fiancé loves the results too and buys me the yearly package every year for Christmas because he know we will both benefit from these experts! I do not have a waxing specialist here but it is close to home and I always get great results. I've recommended this place to many friends and they also love it!

I've been coming here for years and never had a bad experience. Justin at the front desk is always happy and always top notch professional! A couple weeks ago I had an awesome haircut by a student whom I highly referred. My sister got her hair cut and styled by her and loved it. My other sister will go to her too. Trust me when we love a students hair styling abilities we recommend it to everyone.

Amazing and affordable. After helping my sister move this past weekend I was in a desperate need of a massage. I was so happy that Thai Royal Massage welcomed walk-ins and have flexible hours (10am-10pm). I had the Royal Thai Massage and it was definitely what my body needed. My masseuse Tony was very knowledgable and professional. I will definitely keep coming back.. This massage and location were way beyond my expectations.

The best meal from a food truck I've ever experience... And I've eaten a lot of food trucks! My bf says "if this was a stand alone restaurant, it will be packed every day". We waited in line patiently while my mouth watered with every step closer we got to ordering our food. We both had the Connecticut Lobster roll, lobster-lobster Mac and Cheese, and we were surprised with the complimentary size of lobster bisque they were handing out for the holidays. Everything was ahhhhhh-mazing, flavorful, and fresh. I will camp out next time I know she will be in my neck of the woods and I suggest you do the same.

Hidden away on the south east corner of camelback and 36th street you will find this gem! It's cozy and could feel the comforting warmth the moment you step in. We started with martinis at the bar and had crispy pig wars and their yellow tail as appetizers. Every bite was decadent and flavorful. Then we walked into the dining area for our main course. We shared the escargot and squid ink risotto! I'm so in love with their signature dish- squid ink risotto.  I'll definitely have to come back and try their other dishes therefore I'll be coming back sooner than expected. Thank you crudo for such a fantastic dining experience.

Rehab burger therapy? It sure is! I couldn't wait to try this place out due to all the positive yelp reviews. On New Year's Eve, my boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch and we were blown away by the amazing customer service, quality of food, and happy/fun sheek environment. We had the bacon cheeseburger with a side of sweet potato tots. Yum yum yum. We also had the frito chili appetizer--holy was that delicious.  I will definitely be back and break my New Years resolution diet.

I came here once when they first opened up and liked it. The hubby and I decided to come here for a romantic date night and we where happy we did. Everything we ordered was fantastic, delicious, and fresh. We first had the lobster gnocchi...WOW!! Big, chunky fresh pieces of lobster mixed in with their home made gnocchi.  Second, we had the foie gras. This is the best Foie Gras I have tasted so far. The serving was only 1oz, but worth every succulent bite. I was not a fan of the sauce they added on the side. I like the Foie Gras flavors to shine through. Lastly, we ordered the Filet with Brabb. Yumm Yumm Yumm!! I cannot wait to come back and try more of their delicious plates on the menu.  Thank you!!!

We ordered the crab/guacamole appetizer and I had the scallop rissoto for the main course. Wow wow wow! Everything ordered was on point and cooked to perfection. The crab was so fresh too.  I will definitely be back here very soon. The next thing I will order will be the black linguini with shrimp! Can't wait!

We kick ourselves for not coming here more often! My hubby and I came here to try their happy hour and we are glad we did! $5 wines - yes please!!! We ordered the green chili mac and added bacon -- Delicious Fried pork skins (chicarones) - crunchy salty goodness Pork slider - just okay...too much bread side of foie gras - Amazing  and the show stopper - the Brussels Sprouts with an egg on top plus pork belly on top. Nom Nom Nom Nom!!!  What really made all dishes amazing with an extra kick of bad ass was HOMEBOYS HOT SAUCE. We were so happy that they sold this local product here and bought a bottle. My hubby and I are hooked on this sauce.   Thanks Pig & Pickle. You can count on us on becoming regulars.

What a great way to get into the holiday spirit. We came here to look at lights, animals, and sing christmas carols. We tried coming here last year but parking was so hectic so we left after trying to park for over 30 min. This time around we got here at 5:45pm and we immediately parked and had access to the zoo with ease. Come with your family to look at the beautiful display, ride the camels, and see the talking giraffe.

Yes please! Enough said. It was a sweet surprise to come here on a busy Friday night. My friend and I sat at the high top table right inside the lounge and let the high class customer service begin. I wanted to try something different than what my usual order is at Mastros City Hall. We started with the meat and cheese plate. Every cheese and meat was of high quality and flavorful. I ordered the Chilean sea bass with the creme brûlée corn Asa a side. Every bite was AHHMazing. This place is on my list to come back..sooner rather than later.

I wanted to love this place as much of the other yelpers, but unfortunately, it fell really flat on my list. The place is cute, but crazy loud for lunch hour. I ordered the green chilli pot pie and was hoping it would be one of the best dishes on the menu. The crust was so hard and not crumbly. There was a lot of fatty pieces in the pork and it was not at all tasty. I only had a few bites and was completely disappointed with my lunch that I left. I don't think I will be back even if it was a short walk from where I work.

If it's possible to add more stars... I would. I was a big fan on Sandra via her amazing yelp reviews and when I found out she was catering my friends house warming party I literally was filled with foodie excitement. Sandra was so professional and tended to the party with ease. She made empanadas, crab cakes, chicken satay with a peanut sauce, and of course her savory guacamole. Every bite was so fresh and flavorful. I was in awe of her culinary skills.  I highly recommend Sandra for any event. She has raised the bar for any catering service.

I drove here from Scottsdale to meet my dad for lunch and we became instant fans. The place is small and quaint but the food is worth every bite. My dad ordered the Capitan and Boricua empanadas with rice and beans on the side. He was very happy with every bite. I ordered the Capitan and the Pernil. The Capitan empanada reminds me of empanadas my mom makes at home during the holidays. My favorite part of this meal was the Combo Caribe. WOW. Plantains and Tostones are my favorite and they were cooked just right. I highly recommend this place and learned that the Owners are from Costa Rica but wanted this place to have a South American/Caribbean flair. And YES it does.  My dad and I will be coming back soon!

Delish and precise!  We wanted to order pizza but wanted something different than the standard chain. Thank you yelpers for leading me in the right direction. We ordered the pepperoni and onions pizza. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. We were also amazed on how delicious the wings tasted. I ordered them in HOT and they definitely had a good kick to them. Everyone at this location was beyond friendly and helpful. They definitely want to make sure you will enjoy your food!  I will definitely keep coming back. This is a great addition to our neighborhood!

This place had me at MAC and CHEESE and PIZZA. My two favorite things. They specialize is out of the box Mac. We ordered the Blue Cheese Mac, Mushroom Mac, and the Spicy Buffalo Mac. Wow wow wow..my taste buds loved every bite. The pizza is also homemade with fresh toppings. The 10inch Pizza and the Macs to share was plenty for me and my plus 1.  I would definitely be coming back here for lunch again to enjoy more items on their menu.

I'm a Peruvian girl and I always think my mom's Peruvian home cooked meals are actually the best. I came to El Chullo on Peruvian Independence Day (July 28th) with my dad in order to celebrate. I ordered the lomo saltado and he ordered the cau cau. As much as I love my mom, I hate to say that this lomo saltado is just as good (maybe even a bit better - please don't tell her). I told my hubby that I have to take him here so that he can try it out for himself. I even loved their rocoto (hot peppered sauce) and I dipped my french fries in them. It was spicy...but a good spice.  I highly recommend this place if you want to try good Peruvian food!

I feel like I'm on a Mexican vacation when I visit here and all I need is a sombrero and a cabana boy. I love getting away from work and coming back here for lunch. Great decor and amazing patio to enjoy when the weather is perfect. Now let's talk about the tacos... Lots of a great variety to choose from. My favorite are the crispy fish and the braised beef street tacos. Can't go wrong with anything you order here. The salsa also has a great kick to it. Make it your next lunch stop or hot spot... It will leave you and you belly happy and satisfied.

I've brought my car here a few times and  recommended friends to this place. Outstanding customer service, great drive through wash, free vacuums. The prices are way cheaper than most car wash places though you might have to do a little more work. Why not! It's perfect weather in AZ. Might as well get a tan while cleaning the inside of your car. I'm definitely a retuning customer.

I had high hopes for this Zipps location. Positives: bigger bar, nice patio, TVs galore! Negatives: food ( had to take my wings back twice and they still couldn't get it right). My sister ordered the focaccia which was cut in tiny pieces on a cold as ice pita. Customer service was like pulling teeth. We sat for more than twenty minutes waiting on refills. As much as I love their wings, I might go somewhere else on mill with better service who will get my order right.

Okay, so I've been back to this zipps a few times since it's grand opening. I have to say it has improved. Amazing customer service at the bar area if you get Jason as the bartender. He took care of everyone in my party, learned each of our names, and got our order right. He remembered I was allergic to onions and made sure the pico de gallo on the nachos was put in the side. I will only sit in his area of the bar just to get this kind of detailed service. Thank you for proving me wrong the first time Zipps. I will definitely be a returning customer.

My hubby surprised me with a fun and creative post Valentines Day activity. We signed up for the Paint Your Pet class and we had a blast. Jeff Chudy and TJ Nelson (Studio Manager) made this activity fun and easy. They are true creative professionals that will walk you step by step on how to paint your own Picasso of your pet.  I highly recommend this studio. It was clean, fun, and I danced to the fun music they had playing. Every tool to be successful was provided. We will be coming here again and bringing more friends. Thank you Jeff and TJ @ Painting with a Twist!

I'm just not a fan. I came here once with my buddy and it was just plain messy. I do love to eat seafood and crawfish but clothes and hair smelled like fish after leaving that place. I'd rather go to my go to seafood place I've been going to for many years. Unfortunately, I will not be back!

This place DOES have the best sushi in Phoenix. Why go anywhere else? We sat at the sushi bar and had their pork gyoza and a hot sake to start. This was by far the best gyoza (potstickers) I have ever ate. We then ordered salmon sashimi, soft shell crab, and a side salad. Their sashimi and soft shell crab was "OUT OF THIS WORLD"!  As much as I would love to keep this place to myself, I am happy to share it with my fellow yelpers.

I've came here twice and have been extremely happy with everything I have bought. Anything you need to decorate your house...well they have it. I bought rugs, headboards, night stands, candle holders and more. It was definitely worth a drive coming from Scottsdale and I can't wait to bring my husband here since now we are in the market for a patio umbrella and some patio furniture.  You name it..they have it. This is the place to come for great home decor.

Pretty awesome to have Sam Fox add this addition to the Tempe- Mill Ave area. I've been such a fan of all his concepts for years. We came here for a company happy hour and had a great time. Prices are above than what you are used to paying in Tempe, but hey... It's worth it if you are having a great time. We shared the fried chicken and it wS delicious and juicy.  The only bad thing about coming here is the parking. You either have limited parking or have to pay for valet.  Regardless, I would still be coming back to this fun and hip place!

I am not sure how I feel about this place just yet. My hubby and I came in for a date night and we had a great time but really hurt  by the crazy high prices. $75 for two people doing one hour of bowling...the numbers didn't add up. The food was okay but high on the prices as well. We ordered the pretzels and cheese to snack on. We got two hard pretzel sticks and a little slap of microwaved cheese. I don't think we will be coming back because a one hour date costs more than $100....I'd rather he take me to Mastros if we are going to spend that much money.

I am so excited to have found pho near my workplace. I've come here a few times and the pho is great. Service is awesome.  My favorite is Pho Tai (beef pho) and my coworker always orders the Pho Ga. Everything is piping hot and fresh. This place will definitely meet all your expectations!!

This place is the MUTHA-PHO-CAO! We came here on a whim since I've been craving pho. My boyfriend was very hesitant to eat here but decided "happy wife..happy life". Boy wasn't he happy after he finished devouring the Mongolian beef! I had the pho tai and potstickers. This place definitely has great potential for a late night night cap that's close to home.

I really wanted to enjoy the experience at this place but when I went there for lunch the only place that was open was the Bao at the Dragon's lair and some juice/tea shops. My lunch buddy and I came here craving oysters and they where closed. The Bao that we did eat (pork) was really delicious but not filling for the $10+ we spent on two baos. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back to this place since I was very disapointed from the first time.

My bestie has been craving some delicious hot dogs, so one day I decided to come here to pick her up some deliciousness to make her day a little brighter. WOW WOW WOW...who knew hot dogs could taste so good. My husband ordered the Columbian and he ate it so fast that I did not know if he even chewed it. I had the Sonoran and I was so impressed. Erica had the Wunderhund and almost licked the plate.  I am from South America and was very impressed they had Salchi Papas and Alfajores. I am definitely coming back here to taste a little bit of my home town dishes.  Gracias Simons!

My cousin and I stopped by to grab a bite for lunch and completely forgot the PF Changs Rock n Roll marathon was finishing up. This place was completely packed but had an amazing vibe. We got a few seats at the bar and ordered a nice cold Pilsner! Wow o wow! Loved that beer so much I had to order another one. We both ordered the green chili burger and it is by far my favorite burger on Mill Ave! I would definitely come back with the hubby and chill outside on their beautiful patio!

Thank you Yelp family for leading me into this great restaurant for lunch. I came here and sat belly up at the bar. I've read great things about the fish and chips dish so decided to immediately order that. Wow! Everything was tasty and more! The fish was cooked perfectly and battered to perfection. The fries where fresh cut and crispy! Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw but will definitely be coming back to try different dishes!

This place is fantastico! The hubby and I wanted a little something sweet late at night and thank goodness this place is just in our neighborhood. I had the captain crunch ice cream with a delicious toasted marshmallow on top. This brought me back to my childhood days when we would make s'mores with the kids in our neighborhood. My hubby had the chocolate gelato and peanut butter ice cream. He was wowed on how great everything tastes. The owner "fat daddy" was there and we complimented his idea and ice cream creations. Definitely coming back! Wish the outside parking was more lit up.

I was very surprised by this restaurant. Some colleagues and I stopped by for lunch and we had George as our server. George was extremely helpful and was amazing server throughout the lunch. One of my colleagues and I ordered the Fettuccine con pollo. This was hands down delicious. The fresh pasta was such a nice touch and the Alfredo sauce was just the right amount.  My other colleague ordered the pesto pizza and it super tasty! I brought some left overs for my husband to try and he ate it all!! I will definitely be coming back here more often than I am supposed to, but I love love love the fresh pasta. Welcome to the Arizona Center - Cucina Cucina. You have been a great addition.

HOLY MOLY! I think I found a diamond in here.  I've passed by this sandwich shop a few times and noticed they where finally opened. Since it is very close to where I work, I decided to stop in for lunch and see why it has so many 5 stars on yelp. From the moment I stepped in, everyone was happy to help me find the right sandwich I was craving. I ordered the Jaymee Sirewich and it was like a party in my mouth. Juicy and tasty fried chicken, their BBQ was an amazing touch, but my favorite part of it all was Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch French Bread. I immediately sent a picture of this sandwich and sent the menu to my hubby. Well guess what we are having for dinner tonight...YUP, IKES!!
