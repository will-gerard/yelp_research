Generally speaking, I've never really looked at as a dry cleaner as a place to really be impressed.  Typically you take your clothes to get d/c or laundered, sometimes they have promos or coupons, sometimes you pay full price, and then you pick it up in few days. Until this place....  MY ISSUE: As a customer, I had an issue:  my really good jeans finally gave up with tears making them unwearable.  For xmas I got a bunch of new jeans, that needed alterations and hemming.  I went to 2 other dry cleaners asking around for pricing.   OTHER CLEANERS: The first was a very nice lady and top rating on Yelp, except I just didn't want to pay that much for 10 pairs of pants  The second place I went was exorbitant, and seemed like he made up pricing as I spoke to him.  I googled the average price for the alteration I wanted to get and none were in the price, and what he was saying was outrageous.  He asked me what I was expecting, and then abruptly and aggressively "shushed" and pushed me out the door.  Wow. Small business treating local customer that way.  Quite frankly, I was kinda insulted and my feeling hurt for being treated so rudely.  But I digress, this is not their review.  DRYCLEAN USA: Then I entered the 3rd store - here at Dryclean USA.  The owner (husband/wife couple) greeted me nicely.  Yes, their price was actually on target with what I saw online.  But then she did something in addition to selling me alterations.  She noticed one of the buttons were missing, she offered to fix it.  I brought the old jeans that had rips in it, and she offered to stitch those as well (something I didn't even think about.)  yes, it cost money, but it was on what I expected it to be.   RESULTS: I just picked them up today, and the hemming, repair and stitching was top notch.  RECOMMEND: Bottomline is, I'm new to the neighborhood.  I was treated with respect and knowledge.  They solved problems. They earned my trust and my business.  It's a bit out of the way for me, but I'll take the trek and go here from now on.  This is how you run a business!

The family who owns this place is so nice.  Also their juice is excellent whether its off the menu or custom.  So healthy and so good!

NVM is outright professional, diligent, and quick to respond.  Our original home developer and the stock AC unit that was installed had been having issues prior to calling them.  They came out and fixed it right away.  Since the first time we used them, we've called them out 3xs and were expeditious and sided on doing the "right thing" for the customer.  I'd highly recommend them to friends and family!

Disappointed at the service. After going to LoLos for years, finally brought my family to Mrs Whites.  One server working on a busy Sunday (post church), and waited (along with the rest of the restaurant patrons) for almost two hours! Food quality was less than par (going to LoLos from now on.)  Mrs. Whites: it's time to retire, honey child!

Purchasing a home from Wilson Parker Homes was one of the worst experiences of my life.  My Phoenix Sales Representative was abrasive, pushy and incompetent. She failed to execute, deliver and respond to timely documents, emails and phone calls.  During closing time, WPH was significantly behind their construction schedule (which I imagine is somewhat common with new home builders anyway). We addressed this concern with our Sales Representative, Title Company and (their preferred) lender. Between the communication of those three parties, it became blatantly obvious that they were "all in bed" together. I quickly felt that no one was no one on the consumer's side.  WPH was so maniacally obsessed on making their end of month close of escrow date that we received a rude phone call from their Phoenix Division president, confirming (and almost threatening) we close on time.  After adhering to WPH's request (given I had no choice), I've since closed escrow (on time). Unfortunately, I have an incomplete constructed home with promises of completion in the new few weeks (in the middle of moving my family into this home).  Most importantly, I was given one lasting impression: my sales representative neglected to appear at my closing/recording. Given my COE was end of month and on her days off, she was not present to even give me a congratulations. My observation as a sales and customer service manager in profession, was that this was completely unacceptable!  I was finally greeted with my keys four days after recording/funding/closing by a construction manager. This was probably the only positive experience I've received during the whole process.  In conclusion, I want to ensure that future buyers and current customers are aware of my experience. I trust that future and current consumers make the best decision and voice their experiences. I hope that Wilson Parker Homes makes a conscious effort to put the consumer first (rather than their sales quotas).

I'm an OG. I knew about this place when they use to be in that small house.  Now they've upgraded to Baseline/48th.  Same great staff and food.  Quite honestly, this is the best Thai in town.  I'm asian, believe me.    I am however not a big fan of a lot of space.  I like favor, and I like spice, but not overwhelming.  If you are the same, start at a 1 (5 being the spiciest).

Fair value, excellent service and expert in their field.  Zach, my technician was professional and knowledgable!  Moved into a new home back in June 2015, no termites.  Come end of monsoon season, I had them crawling inside (speculating they came into and underneath my foundation).  I had a few price quotes from other companies and got a few that was much more expensive and a another cheaper.   Truth be told, I selected them initially bc:  a.) My technician expertise. He seemed very knowledgable in this trade.  After speaking with a few other pest companies, I knew he wasn't BSing.  b.) although they weren't the most expensive or cheapest, I chose them bc the solution they provided.  I got a whole home termite quote for every other company I got bids from.  Zach was the first one to give me a realistic "spot treatment" quote.  There was no other signs around the home, except one small outbreak of termites.  (Granted I understand they can sprout at anytime).  But realistically, this was a fair solution, and really the right solution.  Results: a.) he just completed it today, so I'll be interested to find out what happens in the next few weeks/months. But I'm not worried. b.)  he went above and beyond.  other companies advised they'll simply trench around the home.  Well the issue with my house was they came inside the house, not outside, meaning they were tunneling through the foundation.  He ensured he drilled inside the home, and also gave an in wall injection.  Above and beyond.

I first found them on Yelp after seeing their impeccable rating online.  There's a valid reason why they score so high:    I had called the team at Sunburst a week ago looking to get repair done to shutters in a 25 year old home I had just moved in, with 25 year old shutters that needed fixing.  I had asked his advice on the items I wanted to take care of and had a great conversation for about 15 mins on the phone.  He had given me a choice to consult at my home and or visit their store.  I took the opportunity to visit them out in Mesa.  George was again quick to great customer service and assisted me in the repair.  It's apparent he was very skilled at his craft and understood the best solution to my shutter problems.  Albeit a relatively small job, I sincerely was amazed at the effort he put in to help me.  It was also apparent that Sunburst, also specialized in new shutter/window cover services as well.  (Honestly, he could have just declined my business saying they don't specialize in small jobs like this but he didn't.  He choose to help me).    Well as it turns out, the home I moved into also needs new blinds and additional shutters in other rooms.  Can you guess the person I'm going to call first, once I get to that point?    Hint:  I'm calling my new friend George at Sunburst Shutters and Window Fashions!
