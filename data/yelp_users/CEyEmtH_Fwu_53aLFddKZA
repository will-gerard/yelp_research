Delux.  Since today was National Cheeseburger Day I thought it only right to go out and find a place where I can get a really good cheeseburger, and from all of the reviews, this sounded like the place. We started out with their take on Bruschetta for an appetizer, which while good, lacked a bit of flavor. The bread was a little too soft for my liking and they piled the mixture on so high that you had to lift your plate to your face just so it wouldn't fall all over the table when you took a bite. So for the main course, we obviously both got the classic cheeseburger and a half order of fries. The ingredients came on the side and the fries on a completely different plate. The array and design of the dishes and food looked wonderful. As we ate our cheeseburgers we both noticed that the burger had no flavor, like it hadn't been seasoned at all. Honestly, they could have just put some salt on it before the cooked it and it would have been perfect but it was lacking on that department. Other than that the burger and the ingredients (pickles,onion,tomatoes, and lettuce) were very fresh and tasty. The bun was the best part, cooked with perfection to a golden brown outside yet a perfect medium between crispy and soft. Very tasty! The fries came with this garlic Chipotle aoli sauce that was to die for! I was well satisfied with the meal. For dessert, we ordered the Classic Root beer float made with two scoops of HÃ¤agen-Dazs vanilla ice cream- and you can't really mess up a root beer float, so that was a perfect ender to an overall, pretty good lunch.  And to comment on the service, it was great. She came only a couple times when she needed to and not any more so we can enjoy our lunch. I give this jazzy joint a 4 out of 5 stars. And recommend you try it out for yourselves!

So my boyfriend and I came here tonight craving some smoothies and reluctantly, found this place open 24 hours, with immunity boosts for your smoothies. Not to mention the smoothies tast wonderful & its great price for 32oz! The service was absolutely delightful, the man serving us was such a kind person and we definitely would recommend this place to anybody! They even have booze to add to your drink and a cool loungy type area inside. 5 stars all around!

Okay im not one to EVER hate on chipotle but I came here today asking for a quesarito which I get at every chipotle and know how they make it at every one. So we came to this one because we just happened to be on this side of town and they presume to tell me that I dont know how its made, and they just fold the tortilla over to melt thw cheese inside my burrito but they CHARGED me for a quesadilla and a burrito? Um last time I checked im pretty sure a quesadilla was two tortillas with cheese melted inside. SO would they have charged me extra for a "quesadilla" if I would of just said I wanted melted cheese in my burrito? ON TOP of that they put my toppings in a bowl and then put them on my "quesarito" after.. and I took 3 bites into my burrito and all it consists of is lettuce. The burrito continued all the way to the bottom in layers of what I wanted on it so by the time I got to the bottom I was only eating steak. (See picture) Absolutely terrible. So disappointed and I will NEVER attend this chipotle again. Maybe they should learn from another chipotle in scottsdale how to get things right.  I love chipotle but this is the worst managed chipotle ove ever been to from los Angeles to new york!

So I would normally rate this place as wonderful, always have great service. Except today I came in like I always do to get a quesorito. (Quesadilla/burrito)  And this young kid proceeds to TELL ME that next time he would prefer I come in before their rush house so HE doesn't have to take time making my quesorito!  UMM EXCUSE ME? What I do in my personal time is nome of your business and YOU are supposed to ACCOMODATE To the customer...not the other way around. I was so furious with this rude comment that I just had to leave a review; it completely upset me the whole time will eating my food. If you are the manager and see this review make sure you talk to your employee about Customer Service and Respect!  *but as we were leaving another worker came up and said he would fix that problem. So I still give this place 4 stars.

I absolutely adore this place. We came in for a quick bite one afternoon, and the chef made us feel like we were at home having a meal. I got A buffalo chicken burger with ACTUAL real bleu cheese and it was amazing. The fact that the use real bleu cheese makes me know that the care about the quality of their food. My boyfriend got the Cuban and said it was amazing. We will definitely be making this place a regular spot!!
