DO NOT come here! I thought I did enough research and chose the right place, but I ended up extremely pissed and disappointed. First off, when I called for an appointment I confirmed with Gina the receptionist that they were in network and requested a price estimate after insurance. Second, I go to my appointment, explain my severe allergies, swollen face, runny nose and all and the doctor chuckles and says "I'm trying to figure out why you are here to see me." Literally those were his words. I blew it off. He advised that they would do one set of tests on day one and I had to come back to do a second set of tests on day two. This is because they only test on the arms and there wasn't enough arm space. When I asked the doctor why he doesn't test anywhere else on the body he told me it was simply so his patients could see the results, no medical reason. (I later figured out this is so they can charge you twice.) I did my testing and also wanted to do food allergy, gluten and dairy testing and the doctor refused with no reasoning. I asked a second time and he said maybe next time. I was insistent because this was something I really wanted and he said he doesn't recommend it and said adults usually have false negatives. At this point I wasn't asking I was telling him this is what I wanted. He leaves for 20 minutes and comes back with a paper, doesn't explain a single thing and tells me to have a nice day. Apparently, it turned out to be a referral to another allergy blood testing center. I had no idea. Gina advised that insurance came back and my co pay was $35. I also asked the if anything would be charged for the second visit and I was told NO. Sure enough nothing was charged for the second visit, not even a copay. Then it gets better, I get a bill in the mail for $600!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They charge $140 for a new patient fee, $760 for the two days of allergy testing, an extra $35 copay that they didn't charge for the second visit and some other stupid fees. I also saw another Yelp review with the same problem. I would have probably been okay paying for it if I hadn't been lied to!

Whether you're an adult or have children who are looking for something fun to do, this place is for all ages! They have so many different products that you are able to create and they provide everything you need down to the different sized paint brushes. Your creations are glazed and ready for pickup within 3 days. Great way to bond and be creative!  Cons: The staff at this location are not welcoming and they seem to walk around complaining and talking about drama more than work related stuff. Nothing was explained to us when we walked in, we waited to be helped and the girl just told us to pick something, paint it and pay at the end.  One employee kept reminding us that we "needed to hurry up" because they were going to close in five minutes. Then she complained to another co-worker very loudly that she couldn't lock the door because we were still in there cleaning up. I understand that the store needed to be closed and the staff probably just wanted to go home, but there was no need to be rude about the situation. In the midst of all the rushing, another employee broke a customers creation while she was cashing him out. The manager on duty didn't handle the situation the way a customer service professional would have.   I will come back to this location, but I was not happy with the service at all!!!!!

Olive and Ivy is my go-to place when I can't decide where to eat! I have never had a bad experience here. The sweet potato canneloni with shrimp is my FAVORITE!!!! Salmon plate as well as the scallops and potatoes are to die for. Try the red and the white house made sangria, it's nice, light and refreshing. Just what you need in Arizona! Nice staff, great environment. I also reserved a table for 12 for my birthday and they were very accommodating.

I came here last week for dinner and was very satisfied. Our server was extremely professional and gave us his presentation of the menu very well, no questions were left unanswered. For such a large party (There were ten of us) drinks and wine came in a timely manner, only one drink took a little longer which the manager delivered himself and apologized for. We ordered two giant seafood towers with jumbo shrimp, lobster claws, crab legs, and split lobster tails. We took our servers recommendation on how many of each we would need to accommodate our party and he didn't over do it to try and up sell more than we needed. (Very impressed by this) The seafood was amazingly fresh and considering there is no ocean nearby it's actually the best I have had in Arizona. We all ordered steak, which all came out at perfect temperatures. I ordered the Bone In Ribeye medium plus which was juicy and tender with a nice light char. They use swarm service here for larger parties which was nice for delivery of food and pick up, but a little crowded since half of us were up against a wall. The only thing I didn't like was that they served our sides for us and I literally got one bite of each side which was just thrown by my steak. Dessert came and our server recommended a trio so everybody could have enough. It came with thier famous buttercake, a GIANT chocolate layer cake and a key lime pie centered with ice cream and whip cream! Delicious.

This is usually our go to place for sports events since it's so close to home. Love the grilled wings here with the TK Signature sauce! Also, drinks are cheaper here than most bars. Would recommend for a quick bite or drinks with friends. They do an industry discount if you have proof. The patio seating is nice too!

My toes look cute, but I wasn't impressed with the service or the environment. The only reason why I came to this location and not my regular place is because my friends suggested that this is the place they have been to before. Bad idea. We actually showed up and there were only three ladies working. They agreed to take the three of us, but were bouncing around between customers. She would start my pedicure then go to finish another ladies gel nails then come back. It was just weird and I didn't feel appreciated. The massage chair was the worst I could barely feel anything on my back. The massage was very light and short. I felt bad that they were so slammed, they turned down at least 15 women who came in while I was there. If you do come here just FYI gel pedicures are $45....INSANE!!!

Went to Sushi Brokers last night and had a good time. It was my boyfriend's first time enjoying sushi so we ordered the Vegas, the Tootsie, and my personal favorite the Surfer!! All of which came out from the barside chefs with a sense of urgency even though it was later at night. The staff was very attentive and very nice. Our server recommended some saki for us at the end, which we liked. This was my first time coming to Sushi Brokers and actually getting both good service AND Food. Maybe the night staff is better :)

Loved everything about this hotel! Walking in gives you a fresh welcome, all the staff call you by name and are willing to help you in every way. Check In and Check Out was very convenient, you can also do it via mobile. The hotel is clean and modern. The rooms are beautiful and have a large screen TV that actually controls everything down to the air and window treatments. The bathrooms all have a roman tub connected with the shower. The beds are great and have plenty of thick pillows. Room service was fast and convenient, she also was very professional and set everything up in the room for us. We loved it here and will be staying again!

This was a last resort for a late night bite anywhere besides bar food. The lights are dim and the vibe is more romantic than family style. Salmon eggrolls for appetizer are very different, but very delicious! We ordered the ribeye- which had good flavor but half of it was completely all fat and the other half was extremely thin for a ribeye. We also got the Pad Thai with chicken with a "Thailand Hot" flavor 4 out of 10 and it was very good! Service was good as well. We would eat here again.

Great place, friendly staff. Would definitely recommend Dustin. It was my first time here and I did the 90 minute introductory offer for $89! I told him where I was having pain (lower back and knees) and he hit every trigger point possible. I get massages often elsewhere and Dustin is by far one of the best! He also went over a few exercises I could do at home to help and he took initiative in wanting to see me back in 3 weeks and made me feel like my business was wanted.

I prefer the Culinary Dropout that is attached to The Yard in Central Phoenix. The enviornment on the weekends is great. Always busy, good drinks, food and music. Plus they have this awesome photo booth machine that you can upload, email and text your pictures from. They do close at 12am so that's the only downfall!

The wait was definitely worth it! We waited about 30 minutes before we got sat, but it wasn't too bad considering how many people were going in and out. The food comes in SUPER LARGE portions, so sharing could definitely be an option if you don't eat too much. I ordered the summer special steak hash which had corn, green beans, cheese, tomatoes and crispy potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes with eggs and chicken sausage. The pancake was the biggest I've ever seen. Both dishes were very good. They have plenty of drinks non alcoholic and alcoholic to choose from. I would like to try lunch/dinner here. You will have leftovers- TIP: Trying giving anything untouched to a bum- We had enough to feed one for two meals :)

Everyone go see Tammy!! She is usually pretty busy so you might want to make an appointment rather than just walking in. I have been going to her for over two years now and she just recently came to McDowell Mountain Nail Salon. Her massages are out of this world, you'll love her. The salon itself is very nice and super clean. They just got in brand new massage chairs recently which are amazing.

One of my favorite spots to eat lunch or dinner! The environment is great at Scottsdale Quarter. Outside seating is perfect. Service is usually good, servers are always busy. Spaghetti squash casserole is the bomb.com!!! Also the root and remedy, matcha horchata, and honey lemonade are a must try!

This place was a life saver after walking around the huge hotel trying to find Rose. Rabbit. Lie only to find out it was closed for the night. Someone pointed us towards Secret Pizza and it wasn't bad. I wouldn't say you have to have this when you come to Vegas, but definitely good pizza. A tad bit greasy for my liking. The line took about 20 minutes around midnight and they only have soda and a couple beer choices. Everything is handmade right in front of you while your waiting which is cool.

Get the calamari, it's got a fiery Asian flavor that's unique and flavorful! So much better than your typical calamari with marinara sauce. Yuck! All the fish was great. I have been here twice. Once for a work buyout and once on a date night. Giving it four stars because of the service on date night. We were given our appetizer and the server didn't come back for 15-20 minutes to take our order. She was missing the whole night and when we had been finished eating for a while we waived her down and she asked us to hold on while she talked to her friend. Expected better service at a place like this!

Celebrated our 2nd anniversary here and loved everything about it! The server was attentive and the food was great. Once you sit down, you get to choose from 3 or 4 different types of bread rolls. We got sea salt option. Rib-eye and Short Rib were cooked perfectly. The sides were super big and we got three, I wasn't aware they you could get half sides, but we will next time! They surprised us with dessert at the end which was a nice touch. We thought the price for the value you get was excellent. Would love to try their happy hour, I've heard great things about it and the bar. We will be back!

Good place to fix a sweet tooth! This yogurt shop has a few sugar free, gluten free, and nonfat options. (I got the nonfat Cookies'N'Cream") It's very clean and organized compared to most places I've been too. Good location right next to Pita Jungle and Sushi!

I did not have a chance to eat here, but I will not ever come back. I showed up for lunch today with two of my co-workers and they have a sign on the hostess stand stating "Please wait to be seated." The restaurant had empty seats all over, but none of the tables were bussed. We waited for about five minutes as the girl who worked there walked by us three times without saying a word, and the sushi chef stared at us awkwardly and said nothing. We decided to seat ourselves and we waited a couple more minutes and did not get greeted at all. We got up and left! We also won't be back. All they had to do was say we'll be right with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Besides the fact that they are using cage free eggs and all natural chicken, pork and beef, I'm not too sure what all the rave is about. I wasn't impressed with the service or the food. It's actually really basic and there's not really much to choose from the breakfast menu. I ordered the cheese omelette with onions and for some reason the whole thing was super watery. I get there may have been a little oil or something from the onions but watery eggs are not really appetizing. I couldn't even finish my plate. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes, which aren't anything special or fluffy like other breakfast places we've been to. It's always so busy here so it's more like an assembly line and I feel like the servers are trying to get you out of there so they can seat more people. Don't come here if you are a slow eater or don't want to wait longer.

You wouldn't expect a place that looks like this would have the best food. But didn't anyone ever tell you never judge a book by its cover? So many good choices to choose from for a decent price and a good amount of food! Love this place!

Love the atmosphere here. Sunday brunch was definitely nice and not too packed around noon. I got the Flanched Flarney Garney egg sandwich. The bun is huge so it was a bit dry, but I would recommend getting a side salsa or something to go with. The chorizo biscuits and gravy is yummy, it reminds me of a warm bowl of chili. Salads are pre-made in the cooler so I wasn't a big fan of that. Dirty chai came from the bar and it was awesome, great taste compared to most places and the bartender was super sweet. They have outdoor seating too. And how could I forget about the homemade cinnamon rolls made from scratch down to the buttercream frosting tower on top of it!!!!!! Can't wait to go back and try some of their rotisserie chicken for lunch.

If you're willing to make the drive and are looking for some good Latin comfort food, this is your place! Giving four stars because of the horrible service, but the food makes this place well worth it. The Combo Caribe appetizer is a good start for newbies. The empanadas are cooked absolutely perfect with just the right amount of crust and are not dripping in grease like so many places. I like the al a carte option so you can choose a few to try. Their sweet empanada options are also a must try. The dizzy fig has figs, mozzarella, and dulce de leche- Great sweet and savory mix for after dinner.

Love Fox Concept restaurants! Love this enviornment that they have at The Henry! The decor is awesome and it makes me feel like I time-traveled a little. The patio is beautiful and the food is great! My favorite dish is the Korean Style Skirt Steak, except I substitute the fried rice for their cauliflower polenta which is AMAZINGGGG! I got the beef short ribs and mashed potatoes last night, and I will admit I wasn't a fan of the glaze only because it tasted like maple syrup to me. Great dish though! The clubhouse margarita is delicious, as well as the fig and ginger mule. Get the sweet potato semi-freddo for dessert. Only downside is the portions are small!

LOVE THIS  PLACE! Found them originally at the Scottsdale Taco Festival, but we love coming here for that friendly Central Phoenix vibe and the food is amazing. Short rib tacos are always juicy and they never disappoint. (I wasn't a huge fan of the fish.) I always get the watermelon margarita! It's so fresh! They also do house made horchata with almond milk, add a little rum and it's 10x better. Also, their house made cucumber mint juice is great with gin!

Had very big expectations for this place, the only thing lacking was the people NOT eating here to complete the environment. There was only us and two other people when we got there. The decor is awesome, makes it feel very modern with an old 50's burger joint twist. The burgers were extremely juicy for being medium well and the flavors were great! We got the Las Vegas (which has BBQ chips inside of it) and the New Mexico (Which had red serrano peppers.....amazing). The onion rings were super HUGE.... You get four, but I don't really like how you have to eat them. All in all pretty darn good for the price!

The best thing I could have done was hire these guys! I was a little skeptical because their reviews seemed to good to be true. (I've heard horror stories about other companies.) Brad was in charge of my move and they were all very professional. They even showed up an hour early which was awesome. Also, considering that they get paid by the hour, they do not mess around. They were in and out in less than two hours and even had to disassemble and reassemble furniture. I wouldn't choose any other company to do my next move!

Can I give this place more than 5 stars!!!? Everything about this place is chic and innovative. There menu is a BOOK of handcrafted cocktail recipes, and it seems like there are limitless options.  I've celebrated bachelorette parties, birthdays and chill nights here. They make their own ice and filter their own water and have things like cucumber "air" bubbles and gin fizz. Yes they are that awesome. They also don't use any "regular" or "well" alcohol and all of their options are considered premium. So if you like Jack Daniels and/or Ciroc, this place is not for you. The last time we went I ordered a BATHTUB drink that serves up to 4. Insanely cool. Service has always been good anytime we go and the servers actually take your order via iPad which cuts out any mistakes that could be made by walking away to place your order. This place is perfect for an easy-going time in downtown Phoenix.

I'm from Scottsdale, so I was super excited to find out that this Sprinkles had ice cream and cookies!!!!! The also do an ice cream sundae where they cut the cupcake in half, put the bottom of it at the bottom of the cup, ice cream in the middle, and the cupcake frosting on the top! Now that's heaven! The staff here are all really nice and they all had a smile on the whole time! Thanks guys!

Got a recommendation to come here and I was extremely excited to try it because of the "organic" product that they offer. The atmosphere is great, I loved the nail "bar" idea and the fact that all of the employees are dressed to impress. The manager Tony was very friendly and made a presence to introduce himself. Their method of powdering is definitely interesting and takes a little longer than normal gel nails. The reason I'm giving two stars is because the man who did my nails was so rough with filing and handling my nails I ended up with cuts around my cuticles which were bleeding and that has NEVER happened anywhere else. I ended up with short stubby nails after I told him I didn't want to cut them he acted like he didn't understand and vigorously filed them down to nothing and even went so hard he broke an edge of my ring finger nail off so then it was uneven. To top it all off when he was done the under part of every nail was stuck on to my skin by the gel or whatever they put on it. I literally had to peel each nail to get them unstuck. Some spots were uneven and some shiny, some not. He must have been in a hurry even though they weren't busy. My nails didn't grow nearly as fast as when I have gels. Not coming back here, definitely not worth $37 plus tip for a manicure.

I was extremely excited to find out that they opened a Flower Child closer to me in Scottsdale! it was actually the highlight of my day! I went for lunch during the week and there was about 20 people ahead of me in line. I was a little nervous about the timing since I only had an hour, but I was done eating in less time than that. (We waited less than ten minutes before our food arrived.) They have fruit infused water for the people waiting, which is a super nice touch for the summer heat. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl with all natural chicken, their chili infused sweet potatoes are to die for!!!! A friend got The Rebel Wrap which has grass-fed steak. Both were amazing and light and didn't make me feel guilty for eating it. They have many teas and house made lemonades to choose from. The cucumber mint lemonade is awesome. I can't wait to go back and try more!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I have been coming to Tammy for 4 years now and even followed her here. She is AMAZING! Especially if you love yourself a good leg massage, nobody does it better. If she's not available, she will welcome you in and give you to any of her professional co-workers. They are all so nice, happy and all about making you feel relaxed. This place is new, super clean and up to date which I love! So many gel colors to choose from compared to other places and they also have the matching non gel color for toes so you're not searching for a similar color. Go see Tammy! You won't be disappointed!
