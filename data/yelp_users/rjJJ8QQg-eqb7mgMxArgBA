I was in Phoenix on a business trip with 3 fellow workers this is where the company booked us since the Hilton was full.   Well to start, the lobby and restaurant are under construction at this time. I'm sure it would have been alot better once that is completed. I didn' t get the roach roommate the other reviewer had, and would say it was cleaned well enough daily.   The breakfast is served from 7-10 each morning and is much better than many free ones I have seen. Coffee, juice, milk, fresh fruits, cereals, bagels, breads and toaster to use, oatmeal and one morning even had waffle you could cook.   Very average at this time.

I was in Phoenix on a business trip with 3 fellow workers and we were on a Quest while here to find a Great Steak.  Our first attempt at finding one was a disappointment.  See my review of T-Bones for that.  After checking out  Scottsdale Old Town District we wanted to find a good steak.  We asked a cute clerk at a shop in the area where to go and she said Frasher's Steakhouse & Lounge was her highest recommendation that she had never had a bad meal there.  Cool, so we went looking for it.    When we walked in it looked nice and casual with booths and a bar in the center area.   Our waitress was a very sweet little lady and she never let my glass run empty.  We started with a couple appetizers, Combo platter which had Potato Skins, Stuffed mushrooms and toasted ravioli served with a marinara sauce & the second one was chicken drummies which was smoked chicken wings.  It was all very good and didn't last long.  The bread basket and herb butter was also wounderful, the waitress brought us more herb butter without us having to beg for it.  For main course we all ordered the Rib Eye which was listed on the menu as "14oz Midwestern corn feeded beef, grilled to your specification with secret basting sauce".  Oh My God were they great!  They were near an inch thick and cooked as we ordered perfect.  Mine was Medium Rare red and hot all though it.  It was so tender with just the right amount of fat on it to give it the taste we were looking for.    I give my highest recommendation to this Steakhouse & lounge.  This was my second trip to Phoenix and if I come back again I will be back to Frasher's.  The Quest for a Great Steak was completed with 100% happy faces and full stomachs!

I was in Phoenix on a business trip with 3 fellow workers and we wanted a good steak.  I checked Yelp and found T-bone and we liked the reviews we saw so we set off In search of it.    First not knowing the area we had to get lost and asked directions from the wrong people two times.  We finally got to the right area and pasted it and found the deadend street.  We backtracked  1/2 a block and found a small signed tacked to a post saying T-Bone Steak House.  So it was off to the left of 19th before the deadend for people looking for it.  I like rustic places and this one looked cool with a very nice view of the city.  I ordered the 16oz T-Bone steak which also comes with the salad bar, & cowboy beans.  Went to get a salad while waiting for the steak and found the salad bar the smallest I have ever seen.  It was a large bowl of lettuce, small bowl of cheese (wasn't sure what it was at first, so dark) and croutons and three dressings.  Oh and a very large bowl of cold green beans with onion and a vinegar dressing on it.  Oh well we mainly came for a good steak right.  The steaks came and they were all also a disappointment, My 16oz T-Bone looked just like my friends 24oz porterhouse.  We had ordered medium rare and they were just Medium, bearly any pink, and not juice.  The bread looked like Texas toast that was not toasted.   I did eat all the steak and a salad but I was hungry, but wouldn't ever consider going back again.  Sorry but no I didn't enjoy it as much as the other reviewers.
