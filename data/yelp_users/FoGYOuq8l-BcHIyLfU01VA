I had a great first experience with this dentist. The first time I called in they had open availability which I really appreciated since it is hard for me to take off work during the week. The staff and dentist was very personable and really tried to get to know me. The office had such a warm feeling to it and very clean. I would highly recommend this dentist!

I have never even tried this place out, but I received TERRIBLE customer service when I initially called and had questions on what their boarding cost were.   A gentlemen answered the phone and I asked about their boarding rates, he told me it was $34.00 a night and it includes "everything" he said. I asked if he could explain what "everything" mean exactly and he started to name a few things such as, feed them, give medicine if needed, let them out and then he said, "I mean, what else do you need to know?" I was shocked at how poor his customer service was over the phone and I knew right away I would not be leaving my dogs with them. Right off the bat this company gave me a bad taste in my mouth and terrible customer service, so I will NOT be giving them my business.   I hope this review helps and with the lack of customer service they are giving to people it shows how much they probably wouldn't care for our pets.

I was going to use Yolanda to be my makeup artist for my wedding but things didn't go as planned.  Initially I contacted her several times to book her for a trial appointment and when I did she let me know she already had another wedding that day. She then asked me how many girls needed makeup done so I explained I had 7 bridesmaids and myself, she immediately became available and told me she would cancel with the other bride because I had more people in my wedding and wanted my business. I thought that was odd but I went ahead and booked her for the trial run.   Trial went okay but I really didn't like how she did the airbrush makeup and she made my eyebrows look huge and unnatural.     Then just a few weeks before the wedding I still hadn't received a price quote on what everyone would cost for myself and all of my bridesmaids. For 3-4 straight days I reached out by text  and a few calls with voicemails to get a price quote so I could fit it in my budget. Finally by the 6th day I just texted "?" and she FINALLY responded. She explained she had just moved and I needed to give her time and be patient. I was livid and stressed out! If anyone has planned a wedding before should know how stressful it is.     At this time I had TWO weeks before my wedding to find a makeup artist! I struggled terribly to find one and was in desperate need. I had to post on FB and reach out to coworkers for recommendations. Thankfully I found an amazing artist who put me at ease. Of course I fired Yolanda.  Please no one ever go to her.. she will give you a heart attack.

My husband and I just bought a mattress and bedroom set from here and the quality is amazing. It's a really big warehouse so they have a ton of selection and for a very reasonable price. Surprisingly the sales associates aren't pushy and are very knowledgeable. They had all of our furniture in stock and available to be delivered within 24 hours. They showed up on time of delivery and set up was super quick! From now on this is the only furniture store place we'll be shopping at. We are very satisfied with our purchase.
