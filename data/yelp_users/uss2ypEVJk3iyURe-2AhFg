We LOVE Summit School of Ahwatukee!!! The staff are all very warm and welcoming, the teachers are excellent in their ways of educating, and the students that attend truly are amazing kids!! They have a special way of bringing out the unique in each child, and building an individual curriculum to help challenge each child while helping them strive for success. My son had many challenges starting in kindergarten in public school, but worked hard and ended up superseding the other children in his classes. The teachers in public school would always give him extra work to pre-occupy him while teaching the rest of the students. He was an honors student, but we felt public school was just way to easy for him. He is now in middle school at Summit School of Ahwatukee and we are all so excited to see him actually have to work to achieve the grades which were so easy for him in the public school honors program. Yay for Summit School of Ahwatukee!!!!!

I LOVE Buffalo!!! I have been shopping here since I was a teenager (15 years ago), and still love it now. I go there all of the time. The staff is always very friendly, and they price very reasonably. I will continue to shop at Buffalo Exchange until the day I leave Phoenix.

My son was an honors student in public school. We decided that public school was just not the place for him due to how easy everything seemed to come for him. We were a little late in the enrollment process, and  were treated as if we were the worst parents on the planet because of it (even though he was still enrolled in public school just in case).  First, I walked into Paragon Science Academy to get him enrolled and the place was filthy!! Granted we did this over the summer. However, I had gone to my daughters public school that very same day to make sure that we were all set to start, and everything was spotless and organized. When I had walked into Paragon, and floors were filthy, there was a cockroach on the floor, and there were boxes stacked to the ceiling of the lobby. Can we say un-organized?  Second, when I walked up to the sliding window to get the enrollment process going, the girl who was sitting behind the counter was so rude!! She had to ask everyone else what was going on, and didn't know anything. The amount of information they required to get him enrolled was also ridiculous, but I had everything requested. When I asked about uniforms, she didn't even know anything regarding that.  There was some other stuff that took place, but to skip ahead...  My son had missed the first two days of school because of lack of organization. The day that he was supposed to start, we had gone in and no-one could give me any information. The school was still filthy, and the floors looked the same (minus the cockroach). (Cleanliness is very important to me, especially in a private school.) We immediately went and toured Summit School of Ahwatukee, which is now where he goes. They didn't require near as much to enroll, were VERY friendly, respectful, and expedited enrollment for us. The place is immaculate, and my son was able to start the first day of school. I am paying for a private education, and my son deserves the best. Paragon Science Academy is not it.

I originally decided to go to Francis & Sons because it is two miles from my house. I didn't have very high expectations because of the bad reviews, but they surpassed them greatly. Everything was well cleaned all the way down to the vacuum. They have an area inside out of the heat so that you can rest while they are completing your wash, and a few games for my kids to play while we wait. I decided to have them detail the carpets and interior recently. They did an amazing job, and only charged me $50.00!!! I have tried a few other car washes in the area out of convenience, and to see which I would like the best... I always come back to Francis & Sons.
