to start im gonna say that i went there cause i was at the mall n i thought it was a better idea there than just any other place at the mall food court, well NOT. we sat at the bar in the begging and we barely got water when another friend came along and said that he wanted to sit at the patio since he is a smoker, well we asked the bartender if that was ok?! he responded "I GUESS" with a bad face! so since then not good,   about the food ..well it was happy hour so..  philly roll- decent  crab crunch roll-decent  potstickers- AWFUL (since i love them im very picky) sweet and spicy shrimp-decent  and i just gotta add that our patio server it was only talking to one of my friends and the rest we didnt have water.   2 bad servers in one sitting NOT GOOD!!!

OK. first thing! you think is just bbq but when you see the menu WOW they have mexican food and not just any mexican food i mean i am mexican n im tired of just tacos,burritos, etc the comun thing ugh! NO this guys know whats up they have pollo en mole, chiles rellenos, COCHINITA PIBIL!!!, enchiladas suizas gosh i just got hungry to think about them! LOL but of course they still have the bbq ribs so dont think is no more bbq anymore they just were smart n made a fusion.  the service is perfect and quick! if you wanna try legit mexican food that you cant find anywhere this is your place and if your friends dont want mex they still have the great bbq ribs.
