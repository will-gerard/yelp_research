We recently switched to PBPC because our current doctor's office wasn't providing our family with the care we expect from a pediatric office.  Our daughter hates going to the doctor's office. She cries as soon as we are in the parking lot and cries the entire time at the office.  We had to follow up with our doctor because we were in the ER with our daughter. We just couldn't take her back to the current doctor and put through all of the emotions again. So I decided to search on Yelp. PBPC had great reviews so we decided to try the PBPC office.  Our daughter walked right in and went straight to the toys...which she never did at the old office. Front office staff was very friendly, another plus! They didn't appear to hate their job. They called her back and she walked herself straight back and got on the scale to get weighed...another first!  When the doctor walked in, he introduced himself, shook our hands and our daughter even shook his hand! She did wonderful the entire visit! Dr. Reznick is a great doctor and our daughter loved him! She keeps asking to go to the doctor.

The doctor's have lots of credentials, but our doctor didn't have great bedside manner. Never once did our doctor try to get to know our daughter. We felt like we were just another paying customer, get in, get out.  There use to be a young lady that worked in the front office that was friendly, but she is no longer there. Other than her, the nurse assistant was always friendly and another lady that works in billing that is always smiling and friendly, but out of all of them that is it. They all appear to hate their job.  We took our daughter in because she was sick and they ran a strep test on her and told us that we would get our results in 2 days. They charged us at the end of the visit and said that they would call with the results. One week later and still nothing. We called and they said that they were going to figure out what happened with the results.  Needless to say, we will definitely not be going back.

Wish it was what I remembered from when I was younger. It's DEFINITELY NOT the same place that it used to be.  I walked in with my family, told the girl, that was just looking at us, that there were 3 and a highchair. That girl looked at us and said, "so 4." Yes, there's a total of 4.  We start to follow her because she starts walking, but not sure if she wanted us to do so, she never said. We walk up to 2 tables and a booth, and one of the bus boys was cleaning one the tables, so I assumed we were going to the one he was just cleaning because the other 2 wouldn't fit a highchair. The girl walks right pass us and doesn't say one word, but she did place the menus on the table at the booth. So I look at my husband and he said I guess we are to sit there.  So we sit down and since there was no room for a highchair, I ask the bus boy, who just finished cleaning the other table, if we could get a booster seat for our daughter (which we don't like to put her in because she is not big enough to sit in a booster seat yet) and he said ok and yelled in Spanish to the girl that, I guess, brought us to our table. Once he yells across the restaurant, I look over at her and she rolled her eyes and made a face. She then noticed that I was looking at her and put a fake smile on her face towards me. So as if I wasn't already annoyed, now I am really frustrated!  The girl walks over, drops off our waters and walks away. I'm watching her walk away because I'm not sure if she understood that it was us that wanted the booster, but I figured that she was just getting our waters first, so I'm telling my irritated/frustrated self to be patient. Our waitress walks up, greets herself (she was the friendliest person in the restaurant) and I ask if they had a kids menu and she says no, I'm sorry we don't. Okay, no worries, we'll figure something out.  The girl finally comes back with the booster seat, which was completely dirty, and doesn't say one word and walks off. (Ok, ok, stay calm)  But I can't! I look at my husband and ask if we can just go somewhere else because I am just done with the horrible customer service. He completely agreed and said that he didn't want to say anything because he knew I really wanted to come here.  I used to love coming here with my parents and siblings when I was younger and now I am just sad that I definitely will not be coming back to this Old Town Scottsdale staple.

Reasonably priced and always friendly. They seem to be getting better at their staffing because the nail techs are doing a much better job.  I have been coming to them for at least 8 years now. The only place I go for my nail needs.

I absolutely LOVE the Pecan Turtle Sundae. My little one doesn't have a lot of sweets so we decided to try the watermelon sorbet and she loved it! Can't wait to go back!

I saw Dr K today and he was great! He explained everything he was going to do and made me feel comfortable. You can tell that he really enjoys his job. Can't wait to go back.

Decided to have something different in the area...bad idea! I got the sweet and sour bowl for lunch. The chicken was dry, the vegetables were blanched with no seasoning (no flavor whatsoever), sauce had no flavor, the pineapples had no flavor or juice in them, thanks goodness for the rice otherwise I wouldn't have had lunch. Never going back!

Frankie is amazing at what she does!! Whether I need a trim or a cut, she knows what the difference is. I've been to many stylist that don't know the difference and all of a sudden I go from a Kardashian to Lisa Rinna in a hour...come on!  I recently went to Frankie for a cut and decided to color my hair after 10+ years. I feel like a new me and it's great! My hair is shiny and it looks naturally amazing!  She is friendly and fun! I highly recommend Frankie for her hair expertise!!
