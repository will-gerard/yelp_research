I have not been here for a few years...but I have always enjoyed Coup Des Tartes.  I recently book a birthday party of  8 and we sat on the patio and man....what a night.  This place is really a "romantic" dinner place.  Fortunately, for us we pretty much had the patio to ourselves.  Our waitress Nicole and Andrea were fabulous.  We really lucked out on the whole evening.  This place is BYOB, so the we brought a great selection of champagne-celebration, wine and beer for our culinary experience.  Plus, I brought in a cake and at the end  and they made a great presentation.    Now for the food.  The food here is fabulous!  We ordered an array of appetizers ..onion tart was awesome. We each ordered something different and for maybe.......2 mins our party was silent.  The food here has always been consistent-delicious, decadent, fresh & the flavorful.     Enjoy!

Came here on a Saturday around 1pm and we had the place to ourselves.  With that said, the service was awesome, took our time ordering from the menu.  We got the carne adovado  plate and the Danish pancake, both we delicious.  Our 3rd party arrived and he got the brisket with fries, but the chipotle mayo that our server suggest was really awesome.  He packed a little for us to take home and I used it later for my steamed artichoke.   Everything we ate was delicious.  The fact that we had the place to ourselves was even more awesome.  We had great food and didn't feel rush.  Everything was perfect.

The food here is absolutely delicious.  We came for Mother's Day and my family could not of picked a better place to celebrate.  The food and service was awesome all around.  Marcellino Ristorante is definitely a special occasion place it is expensive but worth every penny.  Nice touch at the end when they gave all mom's a free homemade dessert.

Came here to meet family for a graduation.  Did not actually stay here but had drinks and used their pool.  The staff was exceptional.  They all were so friendly.  The location is not bad, pretty close to the freeway and stores including Paradise Valley mall right there.  The grounds where very nice and clean.  When I inquired about the rooms and setup my family all loved the amenities, free breakfast, happy hours and clean spacious rooms.  I would definitely recommend this Embassy Suites to others.

This TJ's needs to replace the lady who was serving the strawberry short bread dessert on 5/24.   This TJ's has always had exceptional staff members that are friendly and very helpful which is why we drive over 10+ miles every other week for our TJ's purchases.  So if you are serving a dessert with organic strawberries, whipped cream and short bread to anyone and a 13 year kid comes up ....... and TJ's has an issue with allergies etc. just say, "Sorry, we need a parent", instead of smacking a kids hand away from the sample and then saying "if you fall from allergies, I am not going to help you".    The staff here always been so helpful, fun and friendly so why would you put a person like that at a sampling station who would say something so unnecessary.    I think she needs to take a refresher course at TJ's Customer Service 101.  Thanks For Listening........

I have always love this place...especially during the hot summer months.  It's dark, nice and cool, service is usually pretty good & food has been consistently good.  Although, I do miss the coconut shrimp.  I always come for a glass of wine and an appetizer and/or salad.  It's a great location.

If you live within 3 miles of this place.....it's your local "Grille".  It is a place to go after work or an after "workout" place to get  drink.  Jen the bartender, is awesome.  It's like walking into your local Starbucks and she already is making your drink.  Yes, this place is in a shopping mall pad, so the atmosphere is all locals...but I think that's why we all come here.  The staff knows who comes on Mondays, Tues. Weds.....that's us!!!! etc.  Due to the fact, we only come here after our workouts.....we have only had their veggie pizza...not bad.  But, Jen makes a great a low calorie concoction...which  I can't name right now-working on the patent.  You come here because the bar service is great and they have cold beer!!

This is our neighborhood place to go....and we only go here 2-3 times a year only because we can't get in.  The wait sometimes is so long we go elsewhere.  So, we manage to come the  "in between" times.  The food here has always been consistent...which is what you want.  Large portions and they have daily specials which is great.  The food is great!  I love their salads, we have had their fried asparagus, onion rings-yum and my most favorite coconut shrimp.  Their chicken anything is always good and pasta.   This place has great comfort food.  The staff....always wonderful.  They are top notch and always friendly, great suggestions, not afraid to tell you...my favorite is....  The bar serves great brews and a good wine selection.  OH...and if it's your birthday nice little touch, dessert is on them.

What a gem!  I use to scrapbook so I still love coming into places like this.  I love seeing the creativity they display and as you walk back into the store they have workshops and seating to do projects.  I picked up a few items that I have never seen before for Day of the Dead and Christmas.  I did asked about an idea I had for envelopes for my Christmas cards and the sales associate was very helpful with her ideas and tips.

I have to say last week I went into Dillards to purchase a last minute birthday gift.  I purchase an item from the Coach dept.  The girl was very attentive and wrapped in the Coach box, took the price tag off etc.  Anyhow, she didn't have a ribbon, so I went up to the wrapping area and the associate put a creative ribbon, cute ribbon on the box.  I was very impressed and fully expecting to pay a few dollars for the wrapping.  No charge...she stated.  What excellent service, which is why Dillards-Fashion Square is one of my favorite department stores to shop at.

This place is a classic!  The service has always been wonderful and just love the low key ambience.  If you are looking for a classy upscale Scottsdale bar...this is not it.  You will find friendly patrons that have been coming here for years and they have great prices on all their drinks.  They have an awesome happy hour!! The parking is a little weird but if there is a will there is a way......

Great price on a bucket of Corona's.....other than that there is no reason to come here. This place is a dump!  The bathrooms were disgusting and OUR waitress was not the sharpest tool in the shed.  She could barely get an order straight so we finally had to go inside to order our drinks.   The patio is here is spacious but it's right on top of Scottsdale Rd. so it's busy and loud with all the traffic.  I didn't read if they had food but OMG...I can only imagine.  This place was filthy all around.  Not a fan...

The Tempe location always has excellent service.  I came here with a group of ladies from work celebrating the holidays during lunch.  Our server was attentive and very accommodating.  All our food and drink orders were right on and she new we were only lunch break so it came out pretty fast.  All our food was excellent, we all enjoyed our selections.  The server had no hesitation about bringing separate checks.  I will suggest Gordon Biersch for more luncheons with our work group in the future.

We only went here because it has been a traditional Father's Day event with friends.  We decided to join them for the 1st time......really...we will never go back. This place is a dump. Today was 110 degrees the air condition felt like a swamp cooler, the service was not great either. We did blow out a keg...so reconnecting the keg took awhile.  The service staff really tried to do their best, but it's The Shed I, and it has not changed over the years.  Unless your desparate for a beer....after a softball game at Kiwanis Park...keep on driving.

Penzy's is a great place for finding all kinds of spices.  The store is very inviting and easy to find what you are looking for.  I like how Penzy's have different options in spice sizes.  It's not like the grocery stores where they only offer one size.  So, this can keep the price affordable on what you need.  I do love how they may have a variety, based on the country for certain spices.  Top quality for sure! The staff here are very helpful and informative.  Don't forget to pick up one of their catalogs, which have recipes from people who use Penzy spices.  Nice touch!

Today, The Big Bang held their 1st family Christmas event.  SO MUCH FUN!!! It was a great time singing, dancing and children just having fun.  The whole band-piano players, drummer & guitar player were very interactive and engaging everyone to participate.  All the kids had the opportunity to request a song and they played almost all the requests.   Kids under 12 were free, adults 5 bucks unless you brought a toy for a local charity...they had a few Marines which gave us local citizens an opportunity to say, "Thank You and Merry Christmas!"  They had great prices for kids.. 2.50 for either hot chocolate, hot apple cider or juice with a special snack.   At the end each kid was greeted with a special candy bag.  The entire staff was very friendly and getting all of us into the Christmas spirit.  They had special table set for the kids to color, create special crafts and let their imaginations go wild.  All in all, it was a great time. I hope they continue this event and make it annual.  We will definitely be there and bring more friends.

I frequent here because it is so close to work.  You have to get there right at 11am to get seated right away or call in your order.  I have tried to order online, but my order was incorrect.  The staff here is always friendly.  Today, I presented a free appetizer card to our server ...and the card was for the Superstition location and they honored it here.  No questions asked.  We have come for their happy hour special which starts at 3pm..and that's great because our work group gets out at 3pm.  So, it's a nice option within downtown Tempe that it starts early.  Not too many places start at 3pm.  All in all this location does everything to give great service, especially if they know your work within the area.

Excellent Service!  This is one of my go to places to meet friends for happy hour.  I have to say they did not disappoint when I took my cousin for her birthday.  The bartender was great.  She made sure we knew there was less than 30 left for happy hour, then again 5 mins prior, she made sure we had our drinks and food order by 6pm.  Great Atmosphere and great service.  We really appreciate the extra attention.

I came on the hottest day of the year!  August 15th, but came to enjoy the pool and cabana with friends who were on a staycation.  The pool service was awesome the staff kept us hydrated the cabana included a small refrig to store cold washcloths, bottle waters and any snacks we purchased.  The drinks were really expensive, can beers 7 bucks, white sangria 17.00 each.  The pool was inviting and relaxing. The resort offered plenty of umbrellas so there was shade.  It was fun...it was just so expensive.  Oh...the Fairmont does provide 1/2 day valet for 8.00 which was waived because we purchased a cabana.  They will waive the valet fee if you purchase a drink/snack at any other restaurant other than the pool area.

Whenever in Vegas and in the Henderson area you need to check this place out.  We have been here twice on friends recommendation.  The place is easy to get to and small.  They do have a small bar and seating is comfortable.  Now for the food..we always order a insalata grande and it's perfect for 2 or 3 people.  The ingredients are so delicious and fresh.  We have tried several of their pizzas and you can't go wrong with any of them.  I really love how they feature their Italian beers and wines.  Not pricey for a bottle of wine.  It really has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  The service has been great...I can't complain.  They do have kids plate option, which includes gelato and a drink, which they do not advertise.

It was my first visit.  All my co workers have been talking  about this place....with that said,  ..........walking up to this establishment is not impressive.  Please do not take a 1st date here.  All I have heard is about the expansion..and thank goodness!!   This place is dark, the staff look like they are all on tour of some skating boarding ESPN tour  in town.  BUT!!!!  The staff  (who look like skateboarders) were great!  Each one of them so friendly, polite and very attentive.  Beer selection-par none...excellent selection on tab.   The expansion section is inviting for large groups...which was perfect for our work HH. MENU- as my friend would say......UNBELIEVABLE! I took home a Carne Asada concoction and it was sooooo good.  The calzone idea is great! When you can come up with creative stuffing you can't go wrong.    Ambiance 3 ..too dark for me  Staff  5+ -very friendly, attentive & polite Food 5+- the calzone spin -UNBELIEVABLE...so good.  even take home. Beer 5 -great selection on tab......can't get that everywhere.

The bakery at "MY Store" is absolutely fabulous!  I did not know you can bring in a picture and they can scan immediately on to rice paper for any cake decoration.  We were creating a custom cake and we inquired if they could scan a picture and they said, YES!  I thought it would take a day or two but it's immediately...took less than 10 mins for the whole process.  Best idea since slice bread!

This is a one of kind flower shop.  I always request esperanza rose's and fortunately they have been able to get those roses for me.  We actually pass these beautiful flowers to my sons teacher's each year.  The way they arrange them individual is so creative and each teacher is so excited to receive one.  We really appreciate the extra special attention they put into our order.  I have never been disappointed.

Joe's Farm Grill is charming.  The outside setting is awesome....picnic tables everywhere and seating inside as well.  Although I felt like I was in school waiting in the cafeteria line to order my food, it took a little while to get my order in but the food was worth the wait.  The menu options are great from burgers to grilled pizza's and awesome salads I was very impressed and had a hard time choosing what to get.  I chose the farmer because while waiting in line saw so many go by....I couldn't help myself.  I was thinking salad, salad, salad.  The farmer burger was delicious!    Please note they do not serve beer or wine or they would get a 5 star rating.  Enjoy!

California Pizza Kitchen's are everywhere....usually inside malls but this location  is easy in, easy out, which is why I enjoy coming here.  This location is not crazy busy where you have to wait 30+ minutes.  I always remember this location so if I am in the area I try to make a stop for a quick lunch.    The service is always excellent...great hostess and our waiter was absolutely attentive.  I already know the food......I come for the salads and pizza's, plus I always bring my son and he loves the kids menu selection.   I love how this location is different for some reason because it's never too crowded that I have to wait, but the staff has always been super accommodating, always friendly and if you frequent CPK you know the food will be delicious.  Enjoyable!

They have a great happy hour special that starts at 3pm.  I am always looking for a venue that can accommodate a work group of 10+ in the area.  You would think it would be easy along Mill Ave. but you would be surprised.  We came for happy hour and they have fabulous specials on wines (1/2 off) and specials on beers. Came here with a group of ladies from work and one had a birthday and they gave her a complimentary dessert. Nice touch and so unexpected.    Anyhow, they do have great specials for happy hour check our their website for the weekday specials.  Great atmosphere for large parties and great service!

This is an old favorite.......fortunately our food has always been great.  From the One & Only steak to the chicken and my favorite chilean sea bass you can't go wrong.  Only one occasion where we were sitted on the patio the service was not up to par.  One time during the weekday Eddie came around to the table and my son 9 years old loved meeting him and Eddie told him he makes the best mac n cheese.  My son to this day still raves at the mac n cheese.  It was a nice touch.  We have taken several friends for their 1st time and they have all enjoyed the experience.

This is our first visit ever to The Cheesecake Factory.  We would of never tried it, but we had a gift card.  We decided on lunch on a Saturday.  Our server Amber was very friendly and attentive and we got our drinks right away....we love when that happens.  We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza which was very good, our son order from the kids menu only 3.95, which is a good deal. The food came out fast and it was good!   Now, the bar area is very inviting, roomy and open.  They have a happy hour special Mon-Fri from 4-6pm.  2.50 drafts, but they only had two to choose from.  Decent wine menu and HH special on some wines at 4 bucks.  The only downside to this location is it is very hard to get there.  It is in a weird location at the Superstition Mall.  Other than that we can't wait to go back and try the cheesecake.

Cool Vibe at this place. It was our first visit to Christopher's, we have heard quite a bit about it.  We meet friends for a quick drink and appetizer.  The staff was very attentive, although our drinks took awhile.  We order the wild mushroom, arugula pizza.....which was absolutely delicious and only 16 bucks.  They have a wonderful wine menu, but beers on tap is limited to two.  We would return for the pizza alone.

Took friends for their 1st time to The Mission, I really wanted to know their opinions on their first visit, as I have been several times.  I really enjoy this place, it's inviting, the hostesses are so friendly and I just love the front patio when they have the fireplace going. They already had drinks from the bar, but I came in a little later and it took quite awhile before I got my first drink. =-( They sat us right away...as I had made reservations via Open Table, and our server was right there and ready to serve.  The place is always dark with lots of candles and after the sun goes down they will open up the windows.  There is a back patio and it is lit nicely.  Too hot to sit out in the summer.  Now for the food, we order chips and salsa to start...pretty standard, but when they brought in the extra hot salsa.....there you go.  It was awesome!  Way to hot, but if you mix it with the regular salsa, it's good. The guacamole is very, very good.  NIce presentation too, as they make it at your table.  We all ordered from the special menu that night and neither one of us were disappointed.  If you ask your server what their favorite is.....they will not point you in the wrong direction.  My server stated the Halibut was especially good that night...and that's what I went with.  Delicious!!  The only complaint that night was our drinks took awhile, but they made up for it when we raved about the hot hot salsa and she gave me a take home container.  Nice touch!

I really enjoy coming here.  The selection of produce keeps getting better and better.  I really hope they keep this market as produce, jams, oils, fresh eggs and meats oppose to Scottsdale restaurants.  McClendon's produce has a great selection of seasonal produce AND other organic produce farmer's are finally coming to Old Town.  Bring your friendly dog, try all the samples, buy, buy, buy and support our local farmers and small business owners.  It's a great way to spend a Saturday morning.

I was pleasantly surprised.....I didn't care for the location but it is easy to get in and out, especially when located in a mall.   The pizza was delicious and 5-6 selections on salads.  Ordered the large and it easily fed 3-4.  We had sangrias which were delicious and not a bad wine selection.  All in all it was very good.  Our waitress was awesome and gave great recommendations.

This has always been one of my favorite places to end the evening for one last drink.  I loved when it was J Chew Co. and the piano player.... they still have live music and the duo were not bad.  The bartender was great, very nice guy.  We came in for a martini and a vodka concoction.  Asked us specific on our preferred vodka made sure our drinks were to our liking. He did not disappoint.  Great place to come when it is nice weather then you can sit out on the patio or the upstairs open area.  Don't pass this place up.

This GB is one of our favorite places to stop for snack and good seasonal beer.  We try for Sundays to do our shopping in the area and stop here....because it is Happy Hour in the bar area all day long.  Great specials on their beers, wine and appetizers.  We have tried several of their appetizers, but you can't beat their garlic fries here!! YUM-O! Anyhow, the service here is always great.  The hostess, bartenders and waitress are always friendly and ready to take your order.  It is especially nice when the weather is beautiful then they open up the patio/bar area.  Great place to watch games...plenty of TV's.  I frequent the Mill Ave. location, because I work in the area and it does not compare to the San Tan GB.

What a Gem!   Singh's Farms is a fabulous garden and farmers market.  The whole layout is so inviting and charming.  I really enjoyed Singh Farms because it's not like visiting each "booth" in a parking lot, but surrounded by actual gardens, paths, large trees, a tepee and a cute little shack with more produce, breads, fresh salad mix, honey, jams & pistachios.  The owner does cut fresh flowers in a mason jar for that extra added touch....not to many flowers for sale but if you get there early, you might get lucky.  They have quite a few places to sit so you can appreciate the surroundings. they have a juice shack a little on the expensive side $7 for a drink and they also have a little food stand with a few items that looked very good....they were serving lamb sandwiches.  I would say if you are looking for something unique in a farmer's market...you have to check this place out!

Kerry is very professional.  I was looking to have my eye lashes permed...not very many salons provide this service.  I have been there twice just for the perm.  She does an excellent job.  My first visit she told me how long the perm would last, made sure I was comfortale and before I left asked if I was satisfied.  I get the perm for special occasions and I am so please with how it turns out.

If you can't find what you are looking for here.......you probably won't find anywhere...unless your brew it or crush it yourself.  The staff here is very knowledgeable and we like their recommendations, especially on their wine selections.  Best place to come for a last minute gift.  There is so much to choose from.  They do have wine & liquor tastings, but the tequila tastings are top notch.  We are tequila lovers, and due to the tasting we have come to find some new favorites.  We have purchased a few kegs here and they have they have a great selection and cheaper than Bev-Mo.   We love coming here....we're like kids in a candy store.

This place is total Ice Palace......so it is a great place in the summer.  Really....if I lived closer, I would just sit here all day and order H2o.  I came here with a girlfriend only because she had a gift card.  It is kinda of cool you can watch hockey practice here. It is a total sports bar so the set up with TVs, I really liked.  I notice the booths had their own TVs...that is really a nice setup!  Anyhow, we had salads....not a specialty place for that kind of food......this place is all fries, onion rings and burgers.  Our salads were  bland but  for 9-10 bucks ....GET THE BURGERS!  We were out of our element but we had 50 bucks to spend!  What's a girl to do?

I have been wanting to come here for awhile.  Friends tell me this place is fabulous....and foodie  friends are always right!  It was my birthday dinner with just family so it was the perfect intimate place to have my dinner.  Summer - they are not open Sunday- Tuesday and being Labor Day weekend glad we called ahead because starting in Sept. they are now open on Tuesdays.    The food!  I love how the menu constantly changes depending what is in season.  My 11 yr. son was a little disappointed when they did not have a kids menu.  Rest assure our waitress was on it and gave him some suggestions and he was absolutely happy with his order.  When his order came out he thought this is a small portion.  He was pleasantly surprise the bowls are deceiving and it was more food than he anticipated.  His pasta, butter and parmesan was 13.00 bucks.  I am glad he enjoyed it....little steep.  The rest of us had the roasted squash- delicious, pasta lobster mushroom dish which was to die for.  The flavors in that dish was unbelievable.  It was even better the next day for lunch...had leftovers.  Last dish was the pork & beef meatballs and my husband loved them.  The portions looks small when they come out but they are really filling and just the right amount.    I love how they feature Arizona wines (which I am skeptical at times) and beer...no skepticism there.  FnB served some great AZ brews.   The staff here is great.  Our hostess and waitress were absolutely  informative and very friendly gave us taste of a wine to see if we would like it.  The service all around was great.  At the end, which was really unexpected but they did bring out a birthday dessert of my choice-included a cute little candle and my family singing me happy birthday.....Priceless!

I really enjoyed this place.  Came here after shopping with my mom and wanted to try some place new within Fashion Square Mall.  Our hostess was awesome!  We wanted patio seating with a heater...it was cold in the shade and she made it happen.    Our server was awesome too she was very helpful and answered all our questions as this was our 1st visit.  We started with drinks and then she suggested appetizers -chips with their onion dip.  AWESOME!  They were delicious.  We decide to split the chicken salad and she warned us it had mayo ....classic chicken salad.  Glad she mentioned that.  We also ordered the soup of the day which was "yesterdays" soup and it was excellent.    The staff was awesome and the food was great.  We both enjoyed our chips, salad and soup along with our wines.  The whole experience was great!  Yes...I would come here again.

Great venue to see a concert!!!  I have never been to MIM ....heard great things about the actual museum, but did not realized they had a concert hall.  I am a new fan of Spencer Day...just happen to look on his website and holy moly coming to PHX.  I would not of pick a better venue to see him or any intimate concert.  The whole setup of the concert hall is awesome.  Every seat in the house is a great seat and the acoustics in the hall is unbelievable.  Spencer had a 3 piece band including a drummer and the quality of the sound was amazing.   One last final touch....Spencer came out after the concert to sign his CD's and talked with everyone who waited for him.  Having the MIM sponsor such an event was great.  I will come back and check out the museum.  This will be one of my favorite concert venues in the future.  I would recommend signing up for their concert info hopefully one of your favorite artist will perform and you too can have a great experience.

This is a Yelp favorite so I purchased the Groupon for a facial and it was worth every cent.  I made my 60 min facial appointment and my aesthetician Melanie was fabulous.  Not only was it the whole 60 minutes...not 50 minutes all 60 which was I was really surprised.  It was very relaxing and she talked about each treatment along with scalp and hand massages.  I really enjoyed the whole experience everyone there was very friendly.  I plan to get more facials here with Melanie.

The staff here is excellent!  I can't say a bad thing about this place.  They are so helpful and very informative.  With all the new changes in submitting claims and what your insurance will or will not take, it can get pretty frustrating.  I came in trying to get my claimed reimbursed with the perimeters my insurance has imposed on me...new rules 2012.  The tech took the time to help me get what I needed to submit, took the time to try to find alternatives for certain prescriptions to try to get reimbursed. If you subscribe to their monthly emails, they do run specials on a variety of supplements.   If you are looking for a top notch compound pharmacy...this is it.

We frequent for breakfast only.  They have a great full menu breakfast and a breakfast buffet.  During the snowbird season it's hard to get in.  Reservations are recommended.  The food is consistent and the staff are always friendly and ready to serve.  They do have a full bar for bloody Mary's and mimosas. Sundays summer special are 2 or 1 burgers or appetizers.  They always have a happy hour special going on with cheap beers and margs.  We have played golfed here a few times not a bad course.

Summer Winds Nursery always has the best selection and prices for starting your garden and flower beds.  I love the presentation too...it's always inviting with all their beautiful flowers, hanging baskets and the colorful pots.    We have always found a large variety of tomatoes, peppers, melons and herbs galore.  This year I also picked up a few different sunflowers for my flower bed, not the usually flowers you would see at the other home improvement stores.  They also have a great selection on organic products. There are several organic products that I use and they have them at this location.  The staff there are also very helpful and knowledgeable.  Yes-I am a fan!.

This AAMCO has impressed us with their knowledgeable staff and excellent customer service.  We drive the extra miles to service our car and SUV here.  The staff is very trustworthy they don't try to hard sell you anything.  They are matter of fact, they always answer your questions thoroughly and give you options instead of telling YOU what to do.  If you call, ask for Cipri, she will take care of you.

CALL AHEAD!!!  We live in Phoenix and the AZ Republic featured A Very Vegas Holiday..over the top displays...make the Strip a Christmas gift.  The newest attraction was the Cosmopolitan ice rink, which featured real ice off of Las Vegas Blvd.  We came early on New Years eve and they were closed setting up for a private party.     We showed up at the rink area/pool area and they had staff waiting to let everyone know the rink was closed that day.  No signs at the elevators or any indication that it was closed...BUT..the staff at the pool area were super nice and let us look around and take a look at the rink area. We took a few pictures...so we knew we were at the rink, but didn't get to skate.  Anyhow, it was disappointing we didnt' get to participate in the new attraction, but the Cosmopolitan staff at the time were wonderful to let us look around and take a few pictures.    Note to self.....call ahead.

I never shop at this store...not sure why, but I happen to step in while I was waiting for someone.  I was presently surprised.  I never really looked at their clothes or accessories and I was impressed with there cute T-shirts, scarfs & jewelry.  What made this such a good experience was the sales girl.  She was to friendly and cheerful, she said we are having a great sale right now and took me right to the sales area...and great sale prices.  I came out with 2 super cute T-shirts and earrings.  We have a store in Scottsdale, that I need to definitely check.  Cute stuff for birthdays!

WE NEED BEER..... I would give this place a 5 if they served beer and wine.  SO...I order my pizza ahead of time and pick it up to take home or use their delivery.  I have only once eaten in this establishment.  Venezia's pizza is awesome.  The thin crust is out of this world.  This is the closest best pizza I have ever had next to the one I had in NYC.  I love how you can pop in and order individual slices and they have a great selection to choose from.    Best Pizza between Superstition Fwy & Red Mountain 202.

Brent was our pool guy who came to look at our pool.  We needed a 2nd opinion because have an older pool pump and starting to have issues.  Our home owner insurance covered the inspection.  Brent was very professional and informative, found the issue-which was no way mention in the 1st inspection by another pool company.  He found a leak and repaired it....again, the other pool company did not do.  Brent explained in detail what we needed to do to get our pump and instruments working properly.  Gave us recommendations and a tip or two if we wanted to repair something simple ourselves.  Anyhow, compared to the 1st pool company that came to inspect our situation, Brent was very informative and helpful.    A few days later...the repair leak he fixed and we took care of a couple of things on our own, our pool is back to normal.  It is so refreshing to have a pool company not try to ignore a problem and tell you everything is okay or over charge you for something they didn't fix in the 1st place.  The last month we have worked with 3 different pool companies and Green 2 Crystal Clear Pool provided excellent service.

Ok....we came on a Saturday afternoon from the Scottsdale Farmers Market.  We drive by RNR after the market each Saturday and decided to pop in.  I was excited to see they had a mimosa special that Saturday afternoon.  The hostess was very nice asked where we wanted to be seated as the inside was pretty full but it was pretty chilly outside and she could not find us seating for 4 with a heater that was working.  The upstairs was closed but we did see people seating up there.....so we waited.  She was ready to seat us and a foursome decided it was too cold outside and they took our seat inside.  The hostess told us to wait, but we left.    I couldn't wait to take my brother here as he is a chef in the Cape Cod area and read some of the Yelps reviews so I thought this would be a great place to lunch after the farmers market.  Anyhow, you don't let customers leave you make it happen especially when you have all of upstairs open.  This place will never know how much we spend here on lunch for 4 or the review it could of been.

The Destination Food Tour in Old Town Scottsdale was a great way to spend the afternoon with a few girlfriends.  We all live in the Valley and it was a great idea to walk around see and hear some history of Old Town Scottsdale and try some new restaurants.  We got the hybrid tour and Amy was our amazing tour guide, we visited Rusty Spur Saloon, Outrageous Olive Oil, Malee's Thai Bistro, and The House Brassiere, 5th and Wine and Kelly's.  Each stop provided either a food sample or a drink but you were able to purchase any drink at each stop.    The Rusty Spur Saloon had live music, an old bank vault turned into their cooler and a fabulous sample of their sliders.  Next we tried an assorted sample of Olive oils at Outrageous Olive Oil and the owners were awesome and very knowledgeable.  Next was a favorite by all of us Malee's Thai Bistro, one of the few Scottsdale restaurants that has stood the test of time.  A local Thai favorite for sure.  Next, was The House of Brassiere which was absolutely charming we all had a champagne toast with the chef's favorite biscuits and pork.  It was delicious.  We then walked to 5th and Wine where they had a cute table already setup with white and red sangria's and an assorted selection of bruschetta and other yummy appetizers.  It was happy hour so they had a 5.00 wine special.  Last but not least Kelly's at Southbridge, which ended nicely with dessert we tried Kelly's version of the Twinkie and homemade donut holes sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  We also tried their specialty drink everything was over the top.    We ended up walking approx. 1.3 miles and each stop was 20-30 mins.  Amy never rushed us we had plenty of time to sample, drink our drinks, take pictures and get to know our tour group.  It was really fun and very enjoyable.  Once last tip which is good to know....when you make your reservations let them know if you have any food allergies.  One of the girls in our party had a shellfish allergy, so each restaurant accommodated her with her special needs.  I can't wait to do this tour again.

This a great place to stop for a margarita or a shot of tequila!  The selection on tequila alone is awesome.  Great patio setting, so definitely come here and enjoy the surrounding when the weather is beautiful.  I work near by so our work team will frequent her for happy hour.  They have a decent HH special and if you are a YELPER...make sure you check in!  They give great Yelp specials when show them your yelp check in.  The staff has always been friendly and very accommodating especially for our large work group.

Love, love, love The Herb Box!  Great place for lunch.  The whole atmosphere is so inviting and especially when it's cold outside and the fireplace it's so inviting.  The place is so relaxing and I don't feel like I am crowded in.  Came here after the Scottsdale Farmers Market for a little lunch and the experience was great.  The food selection salads, soups, grilled pizza's and the kids menu was all up to expectation.

Update....still fabulous.  I took my mom here after shopping and our 1st experience was a great experience, so we reminisce and ordered soup of the day - tomato & artichoke soup and  it was so delicious. The food here is always awesome....the service is just just tad slow...and I only think we came between shifts.  I don't mind waiting for the good food, but waters up front or taking our drink orders....sorry we waited quite a bit.  Anyhow. we came for the fabulous food and they did not disappoint.  Service this time around just a little slow.

This place never ceases to amaze me.  The staff, service and food was incredible.    Let me mention the service- it was a Sunday evening and not too crowded, our group of 6, I have to admit we were a pain in the ass.......we DID have reservations, 1/3 of our party were running late (OK, it was me).....CPH not a problem.    Then when we finally all get there drinks at the bar chit chatting away...our table is ready.  We don't want to sit there, we want outside....CPH not a problem.    Ok, so it was another 20 minute wait, now we are getting kind of hungry, so we sit at our original table and order appetizers, but wait 2/3 of the party still want outside sitting!!!   CPH not a problem.  An outside table for 6 is finally available so they move us (Ahhh....2 tables over), we get our appetizers and lucky for us we still get to keep our fabulous server and FINALLY the group is content.   The food was fabulous!  I love going out with foodie friends because we all ordered something different from the menu.  We started with the original chopped salad and pork bellies and they were delicious!  Dinner, we basically order everything from the pan seared scallops, buttermilk chicken, meatloaf the fish and short ribs were all excellent!  Everything was absolutely delicious.    Back to the staff & service, I have to say were all fabulous and so accommodating.  Bravo!  I can't wait to bring new friends to experience this place ......and I promise we won't be PITA's.

What a great concept!  I was invited by a friend, so I really didn't know what to expect.  The BYOB is a great idea...we brought in our own snacks and the whole atmosphere was so inviting.  Carrie was a great host and very engaging.    So...you go in get the snacks and wine table ready....Carries gets everyone setup with their own canvas, paints, brushes and apron.  You sit down and discuss what you will be painting..it's already been decided, but  whoever puts together the event, chooses what will be inspiration.  Anyhow, once you get started and the painting begins, Carrie turns on the music and you paint away.    At the end, Carrie is great about taking pictures and getting everyone's painting, so a nice touch.  It was such a fun experience to do with friends and a great idea for special events...like a birthday.  Hmmmmmm.  Check out their website and get painting.

You can't beat Spring Training games here!  The SRF is just a great venue, the layout, the lawn and all the food and beer options. All the staff are so friendly and ready to answer any questions you may have.  I like that if you order tickets on line it's not another 20.00 in fees like some other places.  You can beat 9 bucks for lawn seats, plenty of vendors, so you don't really have to get up to find the basics...beer, snow cones, popcorn etc. They also have sunscreen stations around the field...so all the snowbirds not prepared for our intense heat.....SRF has you covered!  The bathrooms are clean and always stocked-huge thing for girls, plenty of options for drinks, lemonade, microbrews on draft, domestic on draft as well as in cans and margarita's at Salty Senorita!   They also serve wine!    Food....the BBQ was hit this year....so glad they changed it from Mexican food to BBQ.  The BBQ crew at that concession are all awesome!  They are very friendly and I love if you tip....they all scream out and clap/cheer A TIPPER - WhooHoo!  The food at this concession which is just north of the main entrance is fabulous.  Beats the same old hot dog.

NE Mesa residents- this is the best Thai restaurant in the area.  FYI....they do not serve alcohol. Please note ....we only do carry out.  They have been consistent with their curries 40 & 41..so delicious.  We love #43, Pad Thai, Cashew Nut, Heaven ginger & spicy basil.  We only order to go....expect a 15-20 min wait.  The food is delicious....the staff is courtesy.  It's a must try for lovers of Thai food. Don't let this one slip away.

Came here with a party of 30+ people after a graduation that didn't have plans on eating somewhere after the commencement.  I live on the opposite side of town and would never come to this Texas Roadhouse for lunch/dinner.   I will say....I was very impressed.  This restaurant not only accommodate the entire party, but the staff was awesome.  Although, we couldn't all sit at one table they gave a section and we took over several tables.  The staff was accommodating, patient, courtesy and friendly.    Food-great selection on the menu.  I think in our party alone we ordered one of everything from the menu.  I am not a chained restaurant person, so I ordered a classic burger  to be on the safe side, it was awesome!  Someone else in our party ordered their sweet potatoes and they were delicious.  My son is a mac n cheese guy...and it came out cold he had to send it back, but it wasn't an issue.  They were very accommodating.    All in all, I was very impress with the staff and how they handle our 30+ party situation.  Kudos, to the staff for being so friendly, accommodating and very patient.  I will seek out a Texas Roadhouse -East Valley.  In the future, if some asks let's try Texas Roadhouse, I won't say no.

So......disappointed after everything I have heard about this place.  We have a great work team and we are always planning HH around Mill Ave. as we work in the vicinity.  So, to get our group to stray and try something new, we thought Thirsty Lion a few miles away Tempe Marketplace.  I was really excited about HH starting at 3pm,  So, at 3:30ish, no one is there...few people at the bar, the high tops all have a reserve sign.  First, few team members to arrive, try to get a seat for our group...and we are asked about  our reservations. WHAT! on a Tuesday?  All the high top seating are vacant.  Anyhow, they did let us have one of the high tops.  So, now we are ready to order our HH specials.  Remember....there is no one there.  It took forever to get our drinks, they had nice options with their HH food menu, so we order a couple appetizers.  They were really nothing special.  So, I order the pretzel...looks interesting w/the beer batter sauce.  So, I am waiting , waiting, waiting....had to order a wine...I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.  Finally, I asked where is my wine...oh, it's coming.  How about my pretzel order.....the waitress forget to put the order in.  She did ask if I wanted her to put the order in, I said, no.  Now, I am ready to leave and a friend and I close out our tab.  I give her my credit card, that took forever too. The bill was incorrect.....she switch our tab and put the incorrect amount on my card...so now she has to reverse it. REALLY? It took awhile to get out of here.  As some of our team members arrived at 5ish the place got really busy.  They would put in their orders, but no drinks 10 mins later still waiting.  Finally, they just had to go to the bar and get their beers.    It was a very disappointing experience.  I guess we will stick with the Mill Ave. area.  Too bad I'll never try the pretzel.

POO!  I would think after my last review this place would get their S#it together!  We came here for a birthday event in mid-day Saturday.  No ball game, no derby, nothing was really going on sports wise...so you would think service would be better.    I want this place to succeed!  It's a great location, the concept is fantastic, man...the service was still horrible.  The waitress at this establishment are ......hmmmmm -trying to think of something nice.  CLUELESS.   The waitresses here are cute, overwhelmed, clueless, can't remember anything.    I would suggest just go to the bar and order everything.  More than likely you'll get what you want, your tab will correct and your food order maybe correct.  Still not impressed.

This place has a great patio PLUS a great selection of microbrews.  I loved the setup of this place- great front and back patio-dog friendly too.  The back patio setup is awesome.  Great view of Camelback Mountain and the bicycle wall with the tires that are fans is super cool!  We came on Father's Day and for their BBQ Sunday special and we were not disappointed.  The special was great, huge portions.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Our waitress gave great recommendations and did not steer us wrong. Can't wait to go back!

What a great little store.....some of the cutest doggie toys, accessories and treats I have ever seen.  Lucky for us the Christmas items were 50% off and they still had some cute items.  The display with all the toys and the "pit bull" with all the Vegas toys was creative.  The special selection of grain free treats as well is very impressive.  All in all, very unique specialty store with just about everything for dogs.  If you are a Yelper.....make sure you check in, at the time I got 5.00 off any purchases over 25.00.  Or sales girl was very nice and answered all our questions, she did have to call the owners about the Yelp discount...but no problems.  Thank you Jillian & Ian. I will stop & shop next time I am in Vegas.

Ever since I saw this restaurant on the past Yelp Events, I was curious about his place. We came during happy hour and got one of their house margaritas and it was fabulous.  For 5.00 bucks it was well worth  it.  We also tried their pork street tacos and again tasted so yummy.  2 tacos for 4.25 during happy hour.  Having the fried tostada chip was a nice touch and the salsa's were delicious.   I wish I lived closer so take full advantage of their happy hour.  The atmosphere is very inviting and the open bar patio is great when the weather is nice.

Still... really enjoy coming to SOL.  YELPERS- check in and SOL givez you a check in offer.  Salute!  Man, their margarita's are so delicious their bartenders really listen to you if you request a special order.  The street tacos are still fabulous.  It's too bad we live so far we can't frequent more ...but when we are in the area...we make this a stop.

Friends purchase tickets from Living Social or Groupon, so we got discount tickets.  We got there maybe an hour and half after it open so there were no lines.  I really like the setup, spacious, plenty of food vendors and really San Tan Brewery did a great job of having plenty of beer booths.  Jack Daniels also did a wonderful job at their big booth with their bourbon museum and at the end a free shot and a photo booth.  I thought very family friendly early in the day, great spacious venue for the music entertainment plenty of grass area to watch the bands.  There were plenty of 2 dollar samples but majority wanted you to purchase a full plate which was full restaurant price.  We did try quite a few samples and lucky a few place did give out free samples....again the bonus for coming early.  We left around 5pm and it was really starting to pick up.  We Uber there so parking was not an issue and they even had an Uber booth giving out discounts for your 1st ride etc.  I thought all and all it was a pretty good event.  Yes, I would go again next year we really had some good food tastings.

Came here for restaurant week and it's hard to get to with construction going on and all the one way streets.  You really have to know downtown Phx to get to the valet or public parking.    Once we got to the Palomar Hotel to the 2nd floor to the Blue Hound Kitchen it was very nice.  The ambience really has a cool vibe and a very urban feeling.  I checked out the website and the pictures do not do it justice.    We had drinks at the side bar and the waitress was very attentive to the point we had to tell her we are meeting another couple, we are going to chat THEN we will sit down at our table.  Granted it was restaurant week but it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be.  Anyhow, we finally sit and peruse the menu.  It looked amazing so we decide instead of ordering the set restaurant week menu we would order the appetizers and try them out.  They were intriguing to us.  We order a fabulous bottle of Petite Syrah for only $40 bucks.....  2 hours later we tried pretty much tried all the appetizers and they were delicious.  Great flavors, the corn appetizer you have to cut yourself off the cob.  Corn cutting of the cob skills needed!  It was fun and filling.  We did manage to order the beef short ribs and 3 out 4 thought they were fabulous.  Our 4th person thought it had way too much fat for what you are paying...30+.  He did think the flavor and taste was great!   Our waiter was pretty good.  He was attentive for certain things but we sat with empty and near empty water glasses for awhile. All in all it was a great experience...little things like the bar waitress being too attentive I guess makes up for our waiter not being as attentive with certain things.  Would I go here again?  Yes!

A girlfriend writes the cutest blog and had featured the unique monogram bracelet for her Mother's Day blog.  I had to have it.  So, we went to Found by Domestic Bliss in downtown Mesa to get the bracelet as my Mother's Day gift.  What a cute, classic and if you are into French, this home accessory store is for you.  You have to check out their website to see all their interior design ideas.  They have a small jewerly section but all monogram items that are unique  If they do not have what you want they will order it for you.  Approximately 2 week wait.  Charms, bracelets, necklaces and rings.  The staff is very friendly and the store is very inviting.  Make sure you call ahead as they only open on certain days and they do have special discounts on certain accessories each month.

Roof Top on the 3rd floor of the Palomar Hotel.......go figure!  So with that saying, the 3rd floor view was cool especially at night when the lights of Chase Field are on. We came to have a drink after having dinner at the Blue Hound Kitchen and we really like the vibe, the music and it was a beautiful evening....in SEPT!  This place is spacious with inviting lounge chairs, patio sofas, high tops and the bar.  The DJ was playing some great music it was very inviting.    The bar was limited they only serve can beer....nothing on tab, the liquor was limited not all top shelf but sufficient.  Everything is served in a can or plastic due to the pool area.    All in all the crowd was diverse and the DJ was playing to the crowd which made it fun.

This place is adorable....just love the ambiance and the open patio.  As you walk in you see a wall of cute coffee cups, the hostess was very friendly...all the staff was just awesome.  We came to Morning Squeeze for an event after hours, so you know they all wanted to go home after a long morning/afternoon.  Again, they were all awesome!  They offered lunch for brunch menu and we got to sample a few items on their menu.  Everything we tried was very good- eggs, bacon, pancakes, fruit and their turkey omelet.  I can't wait to come back and try their a few of the omelets.  We sat at the bar and they had a full bar.... mimosa's, bloody Mary's and to our surprise BEERS!   The bartenders were friendly and very knowledgeable about their drinks.    Morning Squeeze is a fun place for breakfast, great menu and great selection at the bar.

If you work in downtown Tempe you have to try this place.  This place for lunch is so reasonable.  Nice to have an alternative in downtown Tempe.  They have a variety of skewer options for only 2-3 bucks.  I also tried the chicken sandwich, which was delicious.  They have a friendly front patio with a bar setup, also a back patio with lots of seating and outdoor games.  Very inviting!

We finally tried Smashburger, it's been the talk of the neighborhood.  Living in the vicinity and it's so exciting to have someplace new to try.......we couldn't get in the 1st few weeks, lines out the door.  We 1st tried calling in our orders, but the phones were constantly busy.    NOW...1st go on smashburger.com and join the smashburger club.  You will receive a coupon for a free entree, basically buy one burger, get one free.    Week 3-we decided we would order out, so we called in our order and they said it would be ready in 10 mins.  Yipppeeee!  We order the Classic, Truffle Mushroom Swiss and smash fries.  OMG....so delicious.  Now, we know what all the rave is about.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and everything including the bun was delicious.  One note...the fries were a little cold, but we nuked them for approx. 20-25 seconds...they were awesome.    The atmosphere is not that impressive, so take it to go.  The staff was very friendly and our order was ready when we got there.  We will be back now that we are in the smashburger club.  No special passwords or hand shakes needed.

I have driven by several times and finally came to see what they had.  What a great selection of pies and they have once a month slices for approx. $4-5 bucks.  Whole pies go for around $13-17.  The place is fairly new and very clean.  We took a pie as a gift for someone and it was so hard to decide which kind to get.  I love how they have fruit pies (peach, Michigan cherry, apple, triple berry) crumb or original crust with a cute little heart cut out in the middle.  They also had a huge array of cream pies too......key lime, banana cream, coconut cream, pumpkin cheese cake, lemon meringue, just to name a few.  They do have $1 off if you friend them on Facebook.  They do charge extra for gift wrapping...basically a bow around the box.  Anyhow, they had a bunch of kids working the counter, which were all still pretty new with what exactly they served and prices on certain items.  I will came here again hopefully it's the day they have slice day.

Wow...what a great find here. Came here on a Sunday late afternoon, open patio, TV's with football games on, just a real inviting atmosphere.  We have friends that live down the street, so they took us here.  Lucky for us it was happy hour.  Great price on beer & wine and a nice happy hour menu.  Service was great at the bar area.  We came late afternoon on a Sunday during football season, seem like a local hang out, not too many patrons, so it was very comfortable.  The weather was absolutely beautiful so the open patio was great.   Our friend who lives in the vicinity suggested this place...as they have been here a few times.  They loved the service and the food....can't blame them now...and it's just around their corner.

HAPPY HR starts at 3PM.....  I really need to start a Happy Hour list on Mill Ave for Professionals.  My goal for 2014.  Handlebar is a great place to grab a beer, so if you can get a seat at the bar ...grab a stool. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and they have a great selection on tap. The waitresses are like a box of chocolates....you never know what you'll get.  It's hit or miss on the waitress service.  They have a great patio very inviting, plus it's pet and bike friendly.     Back to HH.   3-6:30pm and 3 bucks off beer, wine and well.  Great deal.  They can accommodate large parties....wink, wink, work groups.  Great place for happy hour after work with co-workers.

So awesome that La Grande Orange is at terminal 4.  I love that terminal 4 has the best of the best of PHX local restaurants.  What an awesome surprise.  I have always enjoyed La Grange Orange their great salads, sandwiches, great pizza selections and reasonably prices on beer and wine.  You can't go wrong grabbing something great to eat prior to catching your flight.    LGO -great food & great service!

This place is new!  We came to support the new restaurant bar and had a coupon with all their specials.  Great price for X-Large Pizza with 2 toppings for 11.99.  Plus during happy hour they have 1.50 Coors Light.  Great place to watch football they have quite a few TV's so every seat has a great view.  One nice feature is their patio bar area, it opens up the place.  We came for the pizza and it was very good, thin crust and lots of cheese.  The menu looked good and next time we will try their wings.  Anyhow, all in all the service was excellent and good pizza!

Cleopatra Nails is fairly new, so the place is very clean.  The nail techs are all very professional.  Prices are very reasonable and the fact that 8.00 for eyebrow waxing is their standard price.  Other salons in the area are 10-12 bucks.  Walk-ins welcome.  The pedicure spa chairs are all very nice, comfortable and new.  Nice touches as well, they offer water, soda or coffee from their Keurig machine.  Hot rock massages and neck massages are all part of the price for a pedicure.

Under new management but they did keep their prices the same.  You can still get the 8 dollar eyebrow wax, complimentary neck massage with every pedicure.

We did not participate in the shopping crawl but next year I will make it happen.  My husband and I did come early to explore the shops on 5th Ave, it's been forever since we walked up and down 5th Ave to see what shops, salons and restaurants were around.  We checked out a few shops and we told them about our YELP event happening.....they were intrigued and happy to know an event like this was happening.    Morning Breeze.....we loved this little establishment and we can't wait to go back.  We loved the staff and  the bartenders.  The entire setup is absolutely adorable.  I love the colors and the open patio and the brunch options they served.  Everything they served was delicious.  Lindsey was in fine form....always energetic and making this event so much fun.  Can't wait to go back!

If you are on Mill Ave looking for a place to eat.....keep on walking! There are far better places to go to than C.A.S.A.  It does look inviting and I had a totally different experience when I 1st went there, but my 2nd time....I will never go back.  We came with a group for a birthday lunch and a few of us already experienced the food and ambience, so we were excited to have a birthday lunch and let everyone in on the positive experience.  Holy Moly....with the exception of our waitress the service right down to chef Joey and the management staff was HORRIBLE.  The food presentation on ONE order was not up to par and that ONE order made this whole experience unexpectedly bad.  The veggie rice bowl was ridiculous in every aspect.  When it came out it looked like crap.  When the person questioned the order....OMG, chef Joey stormed out....and copped an attitude.   How dare we.... It was so ridiculous it was almost entertaining.  He could barely contain himself when we questioned the veggie rice bowl.  I think he watched way too many Chef Gordon Ramsey shows.  Look at Sunny B's write up...then look at her pictures.  You will see what I mean.  Joey was so unprofessional, ready to fight and so unwilling to rectify the situation.  To make matters worst management came over to inquire about the situation and did nothing.  Not only did they not give any options or did not take the veggie rice bowl off the tab, it was a bad experience that 8 of us encounter and the 8 of will never come back.  Oh. Believe me we are telling our friends and co-workers avoid this place....because you don't want  to deal with Joey storming out of the kitchen!

This place is hard to find tucked away in commercial pad with Urgent Care, Insurance Co and a school.  We came because of a Groupon and we heard from several foodie friends this place was very good.   We came on a Wednesday evening and at first there were not very many customers even though they had happy hour until 6pm.  We got a table right away and the service was extremely slow.  We had we think a new server......although he was super nice he was a little unorganized and it took forever to get our drinks, order our food and get our food.  Once we got our food it was all excellent.  The green chili everything was excellent, the adovada burrito was delicious and even better the next day as left overs.  We really, really love New Mexican style and everything was absolutely delicious.    If you are in the area...this is must try.  Hopefully, you will get better service but it was definitely worth the wait.

We were in Vegas for a birthday celebration and lucky for us it was Las Vegas Restaurant week.....decisions, decisions...oh, where to go.  We finally decided on a steakhouse which our friends had heard great things at Hank's in Green Valley Ranch.  Being a Yelper, I did my research and we made reservations the day of.  We were not disappointed.  The entire dining experience was fabulous.  The ambiance of Hank's is so decadent.  Love, love, love the lighting.   The hostesses who sat us was friendly and the table she sat us was lovely.   Am I getting too melancholy?  Our table was fabulous!  It was roomy for 4, great lighting over a gorgeous chanderlier...the staff of 3 immediately was attentive.  At this point, they were now informed it was my birthday.  The 3 amigos appeared and made the night special.    They read all the specials, but again we knew what we wanted from their planned 3 course menu.  It was the petite filet mignon, wedge salad and a dessert.   We all got the petite filet mignon which was out of this world.  We decided on getting 2 extra sides the mashed and roasted baby shiitakes.  Oh baby.....  The whole dining experience was so incredible, attention to every detail.  We ordered a beautiful bottle of wine and the bill still came out 400.00+....remember, we all got the set price of 50.00 bucks per person for the 3 courses.  As I read another Yelper mention you have to forget about the price if you eat here.  I will say, it was a bargain if you try during restaurant week.    This is my only my 2nd 5 star rating.....

My facial here was awesome!  My facial was not rushed, everything was so relaxing and the fact that I checked in with Yelp they gave Yelper's an upgrade aromatherapy treatment with a massage,but I was getting a facial they gave me bottle to take home. Very nice touch!    NSS is in a strip mall, so it is hard to find unless you live near and know the area.  I paid 89.00 for my basic facial but I know they put in a little extra since I came with a party of 4.  When I say extra it was on them because when you sign in your papers ...what are you allergic to etc. they note extra fee for additional services and I got some with my basic facial...again nice touch!  At the end of the treatment they will tell you what they used on you and try to sell it to you.,...they were great, no hard sell only suggesting.    The one thing I was not impressed with was the NSS says spa,but there are no spa amenities like lockers to put your items in or a place to put on makeup on or take a shower and change.  They only reason I bring this up is we were here for a birthday celebration...girls getting facials/massages and go to dinner after.  There was not place for all of us to get ready.  It was one bathroom shared with the staff.  So...my review is on the treatment only the setup not so much a spa atmosphere to relax after or get ready to go.

What a great brewery, very cool vibe, the birds, the brew, bartenders, balcony roof top & their Beer Sponge....Bravo!  It's a funky little establishment and every neighborhood needs a place like this tuck away on a side street/alley way to escape to.  We came for the brews and they had a nice selection.   At the time they had 6 of their own selections and the IPA was the favorite.  They also had a great selection of microbrews from other fabulous brewery locations on tab.  We order a beer sponge "pretzel" with their homemade beer cheese sauce....CHIRP=awesome!     The staff was awesome too...very friendly & attentive and they all know their beers.  We had a great experience here...can't wait to bring friends here and enjoy the roof top when the weather is cooler.    The more peeps that know about how this place, will flock here.

Finally!  Hot yoga is moving to NE Mesa!    Found this new hot yoga studio on Groupon.  Great deal for 10 weeks and you have 90 days to utilized.  Went to visit the studio first before I purchased the Groupon and was sold immediately.  It's nice and clean and they have a great little Green Bar featuring fresh greens juices.  I picked up the schedule and signed up for my 1st class.  I like that they offer regular yoga and the hot yoga.  The hot yoga is intense and it's nice to have an option if you're not ready for it.  The staff and instructor were nice and helpful.  During the class they assisted with positions to get that better stretch and no pressure if you can't do the intense yoga positions.  If you need to take a break you simply lay on your mat take a break and drink H2o.    Great schedule options everyday of the week.

The BBQ was fabulous!  5 STARS The 12x12 parking lot 1 star  What a crazy set up.  I kind of don't get it......It's like grade school going through a cafeteria line, then the long wait you better really want your BBQ.   Well, lucky for us we had friends who already knew the drill we arrived and they were already in line so we didn't have to wait too long - 45 mins.  So we chatted away until we got to where you order.    Nice touch the owner gives you samples of the variety of meats...which is probably why there is a line (just saying) nice touch but still.  Order our brisket..which was absolutely delicious.  Tried the other samples and they were all fabulous.  I love how they serve certain meals with Rainbow bread...thought that was nostalgic.  Anyhow, if you have nothing to do and want to wait in line for absolutely great food this is your place.

Brand new location in NE Mesa.  It's a great location close to Las Sendas & Red Mountain community.  Also, conveniently off the 202 Red Mountain Fwy.  Grand Opening Feb 8 & 9th 2014 and offering free classes.   Took advantage of the grand opening to see if I would like it. It's brutal but the instructors are absolutely wonderful.  They guide you through the class with 2 instructors...one to show you the poses and the other assist with instructions.  They gave plenty of breaks and open the doors to cool off to assist us that were new to hot yoga.

We came to see Berlin & Huey Lewis & The News the drive is far but the venue is beautiful.  Especially, if the weather is gorgeous like is was for the concert.  Once you arrive to Encanterra the parking situation was horrible!  The person collecting the parking fees held everything up and there was a back up a mile long.  Then if you park in the general section it's another mile from the actual concert. It's quite a walk to the front gates.    Once we got to the gates they had food trucks, beer & wine and everything including the bathrooms (port o johns) were right there.  Thank goodness.....we didn't have to walk another mile for food and drinks.  The concert setup was really spacious especially the general admission area in the Spring you can bring chairs and there was plenty of room to accommodate all the concert peeps  This is a great outdoor concert venue.  I would definitely go here again but rethink how I get there.  Berlin - Terri Nunn's voice was fabulous and she really sang some great songs from the 80's. Huey Lewis brought his fabulous horn section so with his great voice and the horns it was awesome.  It was a fun concert, great venue and just absolutely awesome weather!

Lesson learned....never try a brand new place within a week or two after they just opened.  They just open the Mill Ave location 2nd weekend in March.  They still needed to work out all the kinks.  We came here for lunch and it was almost a 2 hour lunch ordeal.  Our waitress was super nice but everything including our waitress were disorganized.  Once we ordered our food it took 30-40 minutes to get and a couple girls in our party had to wait a little longer, once we got our food it was good.  We ordered sandwiches, wings, salad everyone was pretty pleased with the food except the sweet potato fries  were over cooked, but no big deal.    Check Please!  Lordy....that took another 30 minutes.  Our waitress was running back and forth between 3 registers to process our checks.  That was ridiculous!  I hope this place gets their stuff together because on Mill Ave. those worker bees who work in the area need to get in and out within in hour.  Zipps can accommodate large parties which was great, but plan on a 2 hour lunch.  I'll be back in May or June to try it again for lunch.  We will see if they have improved.

I loved that our 4 legged friends got some Yelp swag.... Our Lucy (Cairn Terrier mix) made out like Angelina Jolie at the Oscars.  It was a nice touch with the Yelp bandana,  Yelp dog bones, frisbees and a Sprinkle pup-cake!  Plus the glam squad aka -Lindsey walking around spritzing the dogs with doggie perfume & cologne.  The pup pampering station was awesome!  A Yelp shout out to Lori Landis for hosting a great yappy hour.  Her gallery was absolutely charming and her paintings were so colorful, I really enjoyed them.   The food was absolutely delicious, I really enjoyed the chicken and the mac and cheese was a nice compliment.  Great presentation from Sprinkles.....adorable setup with cupcakes...there were awesome!    After the yappy hour we walked up and down Main St. the galleries were so inviting and obviously dog friendly some had awesome organic treats and H2o bowls everywhere.  It was really fun seeing all the owners with their pets we did make some new friends and shared some pet pictures.  I can't wait to come back.

Called ahead to see if they had a roof top bar and to see what happy hour specials they had.  We were a large group meeting for drinks.  Well, no roof top bar but on the 4th floor you can take your drinks up just no bar service.  Not a bad view.  No happy hour specials but they had $4 beers & $3 tacos...everything else was a little pricey.  They had a decent selection on tap, our server was little clueless, the patio was kind of small, all in all nothing special.    So now we are ready to leave and our friends rode their bikes to Tapacubo and when we were ready to leave one of the bikes was STOLEN.  The bike rakes were on the side of building in the parking lot.  NO CAMERAS someone came and cut the cable and took off with one of the bikes.  Our friends have been calling the hotel for a week to speak to the manager and not return phone calls.    It's safe to say.....do not ride your bike here and we will never be back.

Great lunch spot for you Mill Avenuers!  Found the Revo Pizzabar during one of our walks so we stopped in to check out the menu and looked around.  The manager came to greet us and told her we work in the area and always looking for a lunch spot and happy hour for our work group.  She immediately handed us a card with coupon discount.  The card include their daily specials etc.  So a week later we came back for lunch (6 of us) the service was awesome, the menu looked great, pizza, sandwiches & salads.  Pizza's were great size for one person, someone else order The Maverick and it was huge!  Great looking sandwich, 2 people could split it.  The manager stopped and she remembered us and thank us for bringing our lunch group in.  We were all very happy with our orders.  Except...the Kale salad w/tangerines.  Although it looked fabulous the taste was bland.  The house dressing didn't accommodate the salad...it needed a little something more.  Other than the salad everything else was delicious.  Again, the lunch service was awesome...we were all in and out within 60 mins.   I'll keep you posted when we bring our work group back for happy hour...stay tuned!

Happy Dance when Minder Binders came back!!!  That corner needed MB!! The new setup is absolutely fabulous...all the décor is cleaned and dusted off and the bathrooms are finally nice!  Just brings back so many great memories...great job recreating the whole place.  Bonus is the patio with gas fire pits and heaters.  No volleyball courts but the new setup is great!    The service was great came right before happy hour ended and our waiter was attentive and made sure we got a round right before HH ended.  We ordered our burgers and everything was delicious.  No more Thunderhump Burgers -Boo!  The burgers were still great.  Great beers on tap, great selection.  Happy hour was a great deal.  Can't wait to go back!

Great lunch spot on Mill Ave.  The patio both front and back have a great atmosphere and have plenty of umbrellas for shade.  The lunch service here is very fast and the staff is very friendly and have great suggestions!  I am always looking for a place to accommodate our work group usually 5- 8 people, Blasted Barley is perfect.  The lunch menu was awesome, great salad selection my favorite Smoked Cobb Chop.  Check out the selection, I can't wait to come back for happy hour and try out their happy hour menu.

Killing time and looking for a place to have a quick drink and what a find!  This place is huge and the beer/draft selection alone is awesome.  This is a true sports bar with tons of TV's all over the place.  Just happen to be happy hour and they have awesome drink specials.  They also have a patio facing North so provides some shade and smoking for people who need to light up.  The service here was also very fast and friendly. Great location to meet friends as it's close to the freeway.

Came to check out the new pet store in the area after a friend told me about a unique dog dish she purchased that looked like a maze to help dogs slow down when eating their food.  Our sales girls was super friendly and asked right away if we needed any help and told us their promotion deal buy 5 items and get 10% off.  We only purchased 3 items and we still got a proportional discount.    Cute pet store with a variety of dog bones you can purchase in bulk not prepackaged.  The dog bones come in all sizes and you can scoop up as many as you need.  They had cute Christmas items for your pets and we purchase a squeaky gingerbread man for our dogs for 5.99. The have a variety of quality dog food as well.  What was unique they also provide a self wash station.  You can wash your dog in their stainless steel sink, no bending over in the bathtub, I thought that was a unique idea.

This is exactly what this corner Kneaded - McDowell & Power Rd.  Today we braved the opening day and the service was great.  They had the entire staff on board greeting customers they provided samples of their breads, desserts and sample drinks.  Although there was a line it was perfect opportunity to look at their bakery display, read the menu and look at all their beautiful gift baskets.  This was my 1st experience at a Kneaders and I was really impressed with the setup.  They do have a nice patio although it's facing west during the summer months the sun will be beating on you.  Plenty of seating inside and out to enjoy your meal. I thought one of the best deals around is for smoothies 16oz for 3.29 and they have quite the selection.  The only downfall I see is they are closed on Sundays.  I can't wait to go back.
