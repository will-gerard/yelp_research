I've had great experiences here. These guys come across as trustworthy, honest and reliable. I just wished I lived a little closer to them but that's certainly not their fault. And I recently learned that they have a shuttle that you can schedule, but there are some types of stipulations to it that I can't recall.  One thing that impressed me is that they answer their phones after they "regular business hours", and I didn't realize that until I asked them when they closed and he told me 45 minutes ago! Haha.  These guys have my business until they show me that it can't trust them anymore. And between Ryan and Russell, I think I'll be going here for a very long time.

Had a fantastic time here! Dr. Simone was great to chat with while she examined my eyes.  This was my first time at the eye doctor and I got lucky on my first try. I'd recommend this place to anybody!

Love eating here! I try and go at least once a week. The staff is friendly and great to converse with. The food is always excellent and you cannot beat the prices! I try and take as many friends as I can for breakfast or brunch.

I try and eat here as often as I can. The food is fantastic and the wait staff is excellent. They are a small business that I am proud to support.

This shop use to be the best place! There was a man named Dave managing it and he was the most honest mechanic I'd ever met. He left for what was told to me was "personal reasons" and now I just can trust this place... Every time I go in for an oil change, they always seem to find something... Sometimes it's $200.00 and sometimes it's $1200.00... What's interesting is they don't find the same issue from last time... Makes me feel like it's a bogus issue. And when I get a second opinion from another auto shop, they say that there isn't an issue with what Meineke mentioned...  The last time I was there for an oil change, they were suppose to use synthetic oil and forgot to do so... And said that all of my radiator hoses needed to be replaced... I approved it ($250 later)... And it was done. A few days later, my main radiator hose comes off as I was driving... Once I evaluated the problem, I discovered that they had actually broken the part where the hose mounts to the radiator which often happens from over tightening the hose clamp. I went to a different mechanic to get my radiator replaced. ($400 later) My truck doesn't over heat anymore. I'm never going to Meineke again.  A friend of mine also went there. She had them replace her break fluid, and we later found out that it didn't happen even though she paid them for it...  It's a shame. Don't go here. You will be lied to.

I had an awful time living here. I signed a year lease here and it couldn't have ended soon enough.   I did not feel safe here. The cops were in the complex at least twice a week and the community is not gated.  The residents are rude, don't pick up after their pets, and flood the dumpster areas with trash.  The staff is no helpful or competent. They don't take care of things for you.  They managed to come up with a bunch of false excuses to withhold my deposit, claiming that it was used up to cover a previously unmentioned "carpet cleaning fee".  I will never recommend this place to anybody. Spend alittle more money and go to Andante or Sierra Vista...  When I got into my apartment it was filthy. I found rusted screws laying in the carpet. The bathroom was atrocious. The kitchen work was spotty. The only thing that I liked about the apartment was that it was very spacious.  The parking situation is a joke if you live anywhere other than the south end of the complex. There is not enough uncovered parking here except for the South area.  You will hate living here. This "community" use to be called Broadstone Ahwatukee Fairways. Look up the reviews from that place, they are accurate. I think they changed the name to avoid the poor reviews that they deserved.  Thanks.
