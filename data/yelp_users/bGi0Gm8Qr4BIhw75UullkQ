I've been going to My Mothers since I've been 8 years old. The food here is fantastic and the people are amazing. I love this place.

We come here fairly often. The food is good, but since it's comfort food, it's heavy sometimes. The artichoke dip is pretty darn good, I'd recommend that as a starter. The steaks are always really good as well.

Daughter took her first class here and it was great. The classes are small and only last a few weeks, so the investment is not intense. The instructors are talented and enthusiastic. The final performance is nice and short and everyone gets a moment to shine. Highly recommended.

Terrible design. There are 2 bathrooms in the whole place and you better pack a lunch if you need to use it, because it's a hike to get there. Seats are old with little cushion. Space in front of your legs is non existent, so if someone gets up to leave, you'll need to stand too. As for getting a seat in the upper sections, bring an air container, because the air gets thin when your up that high. Bring a pair of binoculars and a telescope if you buy something in the upper section.

The best breakfast in AZ and don't forget the bakers basket. The atmosphere is fun and old fashion country style. The home made cookies at the register are amazing, don't pass them up. The egg creations each day are unique and well worth a try.

I have been to Tammy Coe on many occasions and I have to say, each time, it's a treat. The MJ cookie is my all time favorite, simply one of the best cookies I've ever eaten.   The mini muffins are fantastic, just the right size to try one or two or three or...  Even if you're not into sweets, it's worth checking out the store just to see the artistry of the cakes. Each one is truly a work of art.

Compass Grill is always a treat. You can't beat the views, they are all part of the experience you pay for. The food is top notch and not outrageously priced. It's not an every nigh meal, more like a once a year meal. The food is ok, nothing really special, especially for the price, you're paying for the experience.

The atmosphere is what really makes this place. The waterfall out front, the cantina feel of the outside eating, the decorative tables and art on the walls all lends to the good feelings you get when you walk in.  The food is great as well. The mole sauce is one of the best I've had. You will not go wrong if you're looking for great Mexican food.

Great thin crust pizza is really really good. Give the summer salad a try, the mix of vegetables is really great, with a mix of crunch and soft. They also have some great summer specials for couples.

Home made marshmallows toasted on top of my sundae was a smart decision! The great thing about this place is the unique flavors you will not find anywhere else. I've eaten ice cream from New York to California and there is nothing like Sweet Republic. If you have the chance, do yourself a favor and check it out.

The best Indian food in Arizona. The owner is one of the finest people you will ever meet in your life. Everything about the place is special. All of the food is fresh and made on premises daily. Treat yourself to something unique.

Pretty good for a chain restaurant. In the same vain as Paradise, but I think the choices at Paradise are a bit more deep.

Best cupcakes in town and I've tried a LOT of cupcakes. The sizes are large enough to split for two people and the flavors are incredible. For me, it's all about the frosting and the frosting here is the best. Also, side note, check out the kick ass digital signage they use. The images on it are amazing.

My family and I had been here before and the experience was good, so we decided to go back.   This experience was horrible and we will never be going back again.   We went in on a Friday night and there was only one other table of people. Looking back on this, I should have taken that as a sign of things to come.   We order our food and 45 minutes goes by. We see the other table receiving their food and we watch as 3 other "to go" orders walk in and pick up their orders. I stop the waitress to ask her what is going on and she tells me that they had to get the other table fed first. I'm thinking to myself, they can only make one tables worth of food at a time? What would they do if 10 tables filled up?  She tells me it'll only be 10 more minutes.   10 minutes goes by and my 3 year old is fit to be tied and my wife has had enough. We get up to leave and they say "oh please it's just about out" and I say, no thank you we're going to go to Subway.   They have the nerve to charge me for the 4 drinks (ice tea) and the soup. $14.00. I was so pissed and hungry I just paid it, but in retrospect I should have told them to go screw themselves.   Horrible service, they could care less about their customers and absolutely no remorse about the situation at all.   Never going back.

It's good ice cream, but it's more about the atmosphere and the setting. The line is generally out the door which is sorta lame, but adds to the experience in a way.

Trying to eat better and a good friend told me about this place. An amazing way to ease into eating vegetarian, many of the meals have imitation meats made with vegetables.

Average bar food in and average setting. The waitresses could care less about quality service. If you go for lunch, expect it to be a two hour lunch since they must have a one armed special needs hire working the grill. If they screw up your order, don't even expect them to acknowledge it. I eat at a lot of places for lunch, it's my favorite meal of the day, today is the last day for this place. Go there at your own risk.

The beef and cheddar croissant is calling my name, but I decided to go with the Chicago dog and a chili dog chaser and of corse cheese fries. Probably should have gotten the salad, but I don't get here very often and I treated myself.

Great burgers, but the price for s a bit high for what it is. $8 to $12 dollars for a burger is expensive. The shakes are incredible here, but once again outrageously priced. $6 to $10 for a shake is pretty insane. With all that said, the burgers and shakes are really good though.

Really amazing place. We tried the pretzel, sausage, cheese plate and it was incredible. We also tried the bread and olives which were so good we got a jar to go. Tried the Cobia which light and crispy. And their home made green peach tea was delicious, we went through about four glasses each. Our server, Kat was amazing, made us feel special.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I want to start eating better and I'm glad I decided to try this place. The Asian Salad was fantastic. Great atmosphere and people. Only thing I would change, they need some ice for the ice tea, I mean it's sorta in the name.

Best ice cream in all of Arizona. Most unique flavors I've ever had. The place is way too small though for as popular as the place is. There is always a line out the door no matter the time of day, which can be irritating.

The place is super slow for lunch but the smoothies are so good it's worth the wait. The blueberry almond smoothie is my favorite. The food options are mostly microwave heat ups, but the tacos are pretty good.
