First of all, I'm out to have a good time on my birthday. The id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was 11 pm on my actual birthday. Then we get in and the bartender (male) looks over at the female bartender and goes, "are you going to get them?" to which she rudely replies, "no you get them".   Everyone was rude from the get go. We just went to check them out. I give good reviews where ever I go. But I felt bombarded with rudeness and hated it. We walked out in less than 5 minutes. Don't do it!

So good! Went here after a work training. It wasn't too busy, the waitress was very attentive and the food (vegan tamales) were amazing!! I don't typically like tamales but these were to die for. I really like that all of the food is from local vendors but the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be back!
