Went there twice this week alone.   Service is great, the owner actually thanked us for our business and was really helpful when trying to order. Cucumber salad was great both times. Went with a group of 3 today and had to sit outside because there are only 2 tables that hold more than 2 people inside.  Great place to eat, I'd go back.

Top notch sushi at an amazing price. I eat here at least once a month. It looks like a whole in the wall, but don't be fooled. It has fantastic sushi, and the house salad with ginger dressing is really good.

by far my favorite restaurant right now. I've been at least 10 times in the last 6 months. I love taking new people for Ethiopian food.   The injera is really good and a nice change of pace from the normal breads or fries you get in other restaurant types.   The healthy eater is delicious and has some great spices.   The curry chicken is a very mild curry and is packed with flavor. A little difficult to eat with the injera, but they'll give you a fork if you ask.   The Gored gored is pretty good too. Most people's stomachs churn when they think of eating raw beef but it's actually pretty good. I think it would be a bit better if they used a higher quality cut of beef, but it was still pretty good. Covered with some great spices and you don't even notice that it's raw.   For vegetable sides, i prefer the split lentils, the chickpeas and the carrots and potatoes. The lentils have a cinnamon type spice in them that makes them great.  Some nights the service is a little slow, but for the most part they do a good job. They are very helpful will explain anything if you have questions.   They also serve raw dishes on a daily basis. Last time we tried the raw cinnamon roll.  Not sure why it's called a cinnamon roll. I guess it did have cinnamon in it, but it didn't look or taste like a cinnamon roll. One of my friends said it tasted like a Clif Bar, which it totally did. It was pretty good, not sure if its worth the $5-7 for it, but it was something nice to try once.

I don't usually like peanut sauce but tried it at Thai elephant and it was great. Nice location near the light rail.

Burger was great, but the service wasn't so great. When thumbing through my wallet for cash, the owner rudely interrupted me and told me they don't accept cards, only cash payment.   When my friend asked what he would recommend, he shoved a menu in his face and said "I'd recommend looking at a menu".   I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger, which was avocado and bacon, so you can't really go wrong with that. The fries were good and the burger was pretty good.   Service: 1 star Food: 4 stars  Average: 2 stars  http://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2983024079/two-hippies-magic-mushroom-burgers-phoenix

So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try it with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to order and what I was eating and also steer me to the best place in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho experience and want to go back again and again.  unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has it's own entrance and eating area. It had a pretty nice atmosphere, the owner was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured they either eat there quite a bit, or the owner remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The menu had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The owner offered to go over the menu with us, since it was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle it. The place was pretty clean and the staff was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor fish odor in the air, but I wasn't quite sure if it was the restaurant's fish or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way it wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our meal at all.  I ordered Pho with thin sliced beef and tendon. I have to admit, that when I looked at the menu, I thought tendon was tenderloin, so I assumed I was ordering thin strips of beef with beef junks. It wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my order with an emphasis on TENDON that I realized what I ordered. Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give it a shot. My wife ordered a flat noodle meal instead of the soup since she's had it before. The food didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent amount of hoisen sauce, and an even more decent amount of hot sauce. The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my bean sprouts, tore up my basil and plopped in my jalape√±os to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great it tasted. I wasn't really amazed that it tasted good, but that it tasted SO good AND I'd never had it before. Why had people kept this a secret from me? It was fantastic and right up my alley. Soup, hot sauce and noodles. I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's noodle dish, not really enough to give a thorough review, but it was good, and I'd try it again.  The prices weren't bad, I ended up paying about $22 for the two of us to eat our meals and a small appetizer split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.  Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.  Because of this place, I am now a fan of Vietnamese food, specifically the Pho soup.

I've been to Daily Dose several times and I've never been disappointed. My most recent trip I ordered the chorizo mac & cheese. I love chorizo, I love mac & cheese, and the combo is great.   The cucumber water to very refreshing and a nice break from the standard water with lemon.   The staff is always helpful and I've never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for a table. Will definitely be back.

The lunch specials here are great, especially the vegetarian menu on Fridays. The lunch wrap is always a favorite. The salad that comes with the vegetarian lunch menu isn't that great, but the rice is ok. The meals are quick and spicy and the service is very good.

One of my favorite spots in the valley. Love the waffles and the cornbread is fantastic. I'm not even a fan of grits, but I order them almost every time I go here.   The staff is very helpful and friendly. They come and chatted with us and gave us some recommendations.   Not a big fan of the kool-aid, but other than that, everything I've tried has been great.

I was referred to Exquisite by my how warranty company when my A/C stopped working. After their first visit, the system stopped working again after a few days. They took another 3 or 4 days and then they had to send a senior rep to fully figure out the problem. After a few hours, he was able to fix it. About a month later, it broke again and they sent the same Sr tech out. After an hour or so of trying to figure out the issue, he basically said that he may be able to fix the problem eventually, but he has a lot of other customers backed up and needs to get to them, and that I should call another company. It seemed like he calculated that reimbursement from the warranty company and could see it was going to take a while to fix, and he wasn't going to get much, so he left.   Another company came and fixed it in about 2 hours. No problems since.

Pretty pricey food, especially considering I'm not being waited on. The hot dog is $5.50, for a $1 hotdog. Just seems a little pricey from a strip mall, stand up restaurant.
