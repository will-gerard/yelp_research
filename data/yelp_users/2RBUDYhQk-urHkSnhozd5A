This school is ran very poorly.  Teachers are good but administration is terrible.  If there's any kind of major issue such as bullying or harassment the principal will do nothing about it.  In fact she will get defensive and lose her temper at parent/student filing a complaint.  I'm very relieved to have my child moving on to bigger and better things.

Absolute Best Sushi in town!  We come here often!  Favorite rolls are "what the heck" and "screaming roll"... Love the atmosphere. Love the house music and vibe of this restaurant! Family owned and friendly staff!
