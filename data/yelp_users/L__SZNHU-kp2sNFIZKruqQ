Good food, Great Beer, Terrible Service. I understand when a bartender is busy with a full restaurant and bar that they can't make me the center of attention but when that bartender is busy with a personal conversation it becomes a problem. Had to ask for a menu, wasn't asked if I would like another beer or anything else, was simply given a tab....??? Also, it's nice to at least make eye contact when you're asking how the food was or when you're handing someone a tab they didn't ask for. Once again, usually not a big deal when a place is slammed but when I'm being treated like this while you're having a 20 minute conversation with a guy at the bar 4 feet from me and chopping cucumbers.... seriously. I've never been made to feel so unwelcome in an establishment; apparently ownership has a problem with making money. Basic things like checking on your customers and asking if they'd like another beer shouldn't be ignored just because your staff is pretty. I generally let stuff like this go and chalk it up as just catching someone on a bad day but this is now the second time I've received service like this from Arcadia Tavern.

I seriously have no idea why people eat here where there are 100 better alternatives for Mexican food in this town. We had a shredded chicken chimichanga, green corn tamale, and chicken enchilada. All 3 were bland and tasteless at best and all three were very greasy. If you think Taco Bell is great Mexican then this is your place, otherwise, steer clear, go home and pop open a can of processed tamales from Del Monte, you'll get a better meal.

I've been to the House twice now and I'm more and more impressed after each visit. For starters, the atmosphere is perfect. The setting is very personal and intimate inside and their patio is equally inviting. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to food and drink selections and very courteous and attentive. On our first visit our bartender Kevin welcomed us and after finding out it was our first visit he took the time to suggest several food selections and drinks.   The food is some of the best I've sampled in the valley; every dish is off the beaten path and an unexpected joy to taste for the first time. Far to often new establishments play it safe and don't stray to far from the norm of southwestern cuisine but The House Brasserie's kitchen and chef do a remarkable job of introducing their patrons to a sampling of dishes that are both creative and amazing. My suggestion, try the Duck Confit Bahn Mi!  If you're looking for an excellent meal that outside the norm you've got to stop by The House Brasserie.

Purchased a $4000 service contract from Scottsdale Jeep that covers all maintenance for my 2014 Grand Cherokee. I've used said contract at 3 local dealerships so far to cover oil changes and other maintenance without incident. Most dealerships initially warn me that MPP (the service contract) usually doesn't pay for maintenance but they all happily check with them, figure it out, and complete my service. Not Earnhardt, I was given a prompt "we don't work with them". Asked to speak to the service manager, nope, busy. Don't worry Earnhardt, I'll happily take my business elsewhere and happily crap all over your reputation any chance I get.
