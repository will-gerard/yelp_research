Have been here multiple times but after today,  not going back.  I expect to wait for a table, but expect to be greeted by my server sooner than 15 minutes after being seated! And even longer to get drinks and place order, and 35 minutes later got our food - for 2 people! No excuse! Although our server was very friendly, a quick word about why food was taking so long would have helped his tip. Food was ok but not great this time. Wish I would have made my own tastier breakfast instead of wasting $30 and 1 hour and 45 minutes plus drive time.

Having recently turned vegetarian for health reasons, I wondered if the Paneer Tikka Masala could be half as good as their Chicken Tikka Masala, which was the best I've had from England to NYC to Phx. Well, no need to worry because it was superb! Smooth and creamy, the dish melts in your mouth. There are numerous vegetarian options. I strongly suggest samosas to start, and you can't go wrong with their saag/palak, chana masala, either of the dahls, the yummy okra dish, or the aloo gobi with savory cauliflower and potatoes. Add rice and garlic naan and you will have a delicious  meal. Take some home too cuz it's even better the next day!  Friendly and courteous staff, and the owner usually stops by every table.
