I'm pretty sure this is now called Let-it-Roll Bowl.  I've been here twice in the last few months and it is a really fun place to have a party. The bowling is cheap as dirt, the drinks are cheap as dirt, and the restaurants food is VERY good.   I was here just last Friday night for a girlfriend's birthday and we had a blast.  It was during cosmic bowling and I think EVERYONE had a great time.  Cedric Ceballos was the DJ (yep, you read that right). He was OK. I've heard better, but for sort of a "low rent" part of town, it was wonderful. And very inexpensive.  I will keep visiting as long as they keep their prices right and the atmosphere light.

Inexpensive, greasy Asian food. It doesn't get better than this amazing Glendale institution that's been around forever.  Decor is crazy tacky but who cares when the food is so good.   I'm obsessed with the noodles and my husband chooses the beef and broccoli everytime.  Even my toddlers eat it all.   All in all delicious dinner.  Oh and remember they're closed Mondays!

Wasn't horrible,  wasn't good either. I came into the salon asking for a pretty dramatic change in both color and cut. I was seen right away which was nice and discussed the color and cut I wanted with my stylist who assured me she knew what she was doing. She didn't.   Asking for an ombre might be a new concept to some, but in this day and age it seems like every other person is getting one and most stylists should be well versed in it.  Don't assume. After a shocking bleach job on everything besides an inch of my roots the owner clearly saw the look  of terror on my face and had to explain to the stylist how to fix it.  After 5 and a half hours (not even kidding) my hair was finally done (and perpetually fried). I didn't have enough time to wait or enough patience for a style and walked out with wet hair. A couple of days have passed and I actually like how it turned out... that's why it's getting 2 stars. Now, I hope that this was a singular problem that won't happen again but there were more issues.  I was booted out of my chair while the stylist took another client while my hair was (over) processing. A few hours later my stylist took on yet another client and left me sitting with color on my hair longer than necessary. Personal phone calls were being made constantly.    The client is made to feel the least important here,  and for the price I paid I could've gone somewhere a little nicer and could have saved myself 5 hours.

I love this place. This bar ends up being my husband and I's date night favorite. It's close to our home, there is an inside-ish air conditioned patio where we can smoke, the beers are big and ice cold and they even have shuffle board.  The juke box is loud and always on point. Sure it's a little "dive" that truly is not in any way an authentic Irish pub but they don't shove the fact that they're an Irish bar in your face. It's a great place to grab a few ice cold beers, eat some of the CRAZY AMAZING wings, and relax.

I love The Root! I have been going to the wonderful and hilarious Roxanne for just a few months now, but I've been so satisfied!  I've had my hair colored twice and everytime it turns out perfectly.  Rox knows exactly what she is doing. My hair cuts have been PERFECT as well as my eyebrow waxes, they always look great.    I would recommoned the Root to anyone, and I'd especially recommend Roxanne.  But all of the stylists are just as friendly.

My husband and I got married here in November of 2009.  We were the first wedding on the premises since the building was constructed in the early 1900s.  We wanted something different and something downtown and when we came across CMOP we were so impressed by the space, and the staff that we knew we had to have our wedding here.   We said our vows in the "technical" front of the building, which is now actually the back area facing 7th St. The cocktail hour was held on the third floor and our reception was sprawled along the second floor.  The dancing took place in the room where people often eat lunch or snacks, but it was cleared out. Being the first wedding here it was a challenge to coordinate tables, chairs, catering, music etc.. but it was a learning experience for the staff as well as myself.  They handled it with ease and I was so happy with the final outcome.  If you are looking for a amazingly fun place to get married or have an event in downtown Phoenix I would suggest the Children's Museum for you.  I can't wait to bring my daughter here when she is old enough to enjoy it herself.
