Having been regulars for the past 10 years, last spring, my family and I went to eat there for a celebration. We were surprised to see the change in the layout of the restaurant. There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal. The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so, for me, I settled for a mushroom burger. We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was "helping" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water. We found it very rude when they would take our plates away without even bother asking. I did not enjoy my meal that day and we do not plan on returning to this poorly, functioned restaurant.

Every time that my family and/or friends go here for a special occasion (the last time was for my birthday this year): the staff was always accommodating and friendly. We are always pleased with their services and we have been going there for 7 years. The food is delicious and savory each time. I try to change up my eating preferences because I am never disappointed with what they have on the menu. Not to mention, they have great management.
