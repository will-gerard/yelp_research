This place is so great!  They are always so friendly and get you in as quickly as they can if you don't have an appointment.  They always do an amazing job that lasts a long time.  I have taken numerous friends here and everyone I have taken has loved it.  It is very inexpensive for the quality of service you get!

I've been to this place 3 times. The first two times were ok...they did a good job but just seemed hurried to get me out of there. Then I went to go in for the third time and was running late which is rare but besides the point. Apparently there is an 8 minute cancelation policy which no one has ever informed me of. I got there at exactly 8 minutes late and they said sorry can't do anything about it you can come back 3 hours later. They just lost business over 8 minutes. I will not come back to this place.

Service was good, food was sub par.  I wouldn't recommend.  Everything was very bland.

This place is a gem!  All of the instructors for both spin and yoga are great teachers who want your experience to be the best.  They genuinely love what they are doing which makes their classes so amazing.  I am always drenched in sweat after each class!  I was sort of skeptical to come here before it opened because it was slightly intimidating...with all of the best teachers from all around the valley having a large following of yogis and spinners, I was worried I'd feel out of place.  That did not happen at all!  I have always been greeted with smiling faces from all of the staff and the teachers.  They make all classes for all levels, so it really is great for everyone.  The food.  The. food. is. amazing.  Who knew that I would like a you're so keen (quinoa burger) more than a regular beef burger!  They give you great healthy options so you can have a delicious lunch that makes you feel good and is good for you!  The juices are amazing, and if you want to create your own, you can!  Overall, this place is a 9.99, only because I wish they would have more than one shower!  I like to go to class in the morning and go straight to work, and others have the same idea, so we have to take turns having quick showers...it would be nice if there was at least one more shower!! :)

Love this place! Has the freshest tasting juice that is cold pressed and knowledgeable people to help you with a cleanse or just a kick start to a healthier life!  I spent quite some time there the other day just talking with Alexandra!  I came in just before closing and wanted to start a cleanse the next day.  They were basically out of juices so instead of having me come back when they opened the next day, she told me to just come back later that night when they were done juicing and she would help me pick out juices to make a great cleanse!  Needless to say, all of their juices taste amazing!  It's kind of pricey, but definitely worth it!

So pho King good. Best pho I've had. And those Sriracha buffalo chicken potstickers. Oh my. Great service and staff. It's a real life food truck! Will be coming back here frequently!

I called before I made the trek out to the store to see if they had a particular brand of shampoo and they said they did. Upon my arrival they said they didn't carry it but had "something similar". I'm not sure if they genuinely didn't know what product they have or if they were just trying to get me into the store to buy something else from them but it didn't work. I let them know I was upset and they didn't even try to apologize. I won't be coming back to this ulta again. Hopefully other ones will be better.
