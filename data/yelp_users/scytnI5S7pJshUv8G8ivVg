Great place! I am here very frequently- and I'm always happy with the price and service. They do a great job on my nails, and I would recommend to anyone!

Great food, not so great barista knowledge. I've given a few "lessons" in Americano drink building here. Not sure if employees were new, but higher expectations from a place with an expensive espresso machine.  I take my coffee cravings two miles down the street to DD now.

Do not go here for eyebrow waxing!   I was led to the back, expecting a typical "waxing room" and was instead seated in a salon chair, and told to lean down to let my head rest on the top of the chair. I'm almost 5'9- you kidding me? My neck hurt the entire time. What a joke.   I almost left that instant, however, I was in a hurry so decided to give in a chance.   The cigarette wrenched smelling stylist pulled out a makeup bag of sorts to get her wax solution ready.  (Ok- so now I'm really irked. Is this a backdoor alley operation or..?)   My eyebrows were pencilled in- to which I started with "you're going to have to remove the pencil to wax them" she said it wasn't necessary to maintain the shape, and waxed over it, or around it, etc. Really? This is not normal.   I get home and use makeup remover to remove the pencil, and do  my own remaining brow hairs, for a $12 job that should have been completed before I walked off.   Not professional, not my cup of tea. I prefer somewhere that caters to regular eyebrow waxing- not a make-do situation.

Love it. I get my Pad Thai dinner takeout fix a few times a week here. I have to say their to-go packing accuracy is 100%- which is often a rarity when ordering complex or specialty items at other fast casual establishments. Thanks team!

The best! I've been to many salons around Phoenix, and this one is by far the best. Kind service, great stylists!

Excellent place.   My children have only been going here about a month, however;I am so impressed with the cleanliness, safety, and teaching that happens here.  My youngest started speaking the week we switched to this school, and my oldest has shown calmer behavior at home.   I've been to a few preschools and daycares around north Phoenix, and I can say by far this one is the best.   I have no association with anyone working there (in regards to the bad review in which the person states all good reviews are from employees!) .... Just a serious interest in my children's development.   Grateful to have found this establishment, and looking forward to having my two year old grow here over the next few years!

This DD is the best!! Lightning fast service with a smile. I live right by three coffee places, but I drive 5 miles (out of my way) round trip here most mornings to get my large iced coffee, light ice, light cream, no sugar, and one pump of mocha. Thanks for making my mornings, crew!

Great place! We order delivery from here frequently... And they are always quick and kind. Tonight, they were running behind schedule on delivery, and the manager on shift called to tell me they were running behind! Who does that!? Wonderful customer service. Thanks team! You all rock.

Not impressed. Empty on a Saturday morning- multiple tables stacked with dirty dishes for the hour I was there. Waited 15 minutes for an Americano to be delivered... And it was as clear as iced tea. Cute place, but doesn't live up to the intention it might have as a restaurant.
