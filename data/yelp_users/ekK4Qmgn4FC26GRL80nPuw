We have ordered from here a few times now and Chizona's has never disappointed, the pizza has been great every time. We also love the cheese garlic bread. Being from the Midwest, I was also very happy to find a place with a good pizza puff. I haven't had the hot dog yet but I've only heard good things - can't wait to try a couple.  Go Sox!

I eat here about once a week. You can't beat the lunch specials, especially on Fridays when its a giant slice of meat lovers, 6 wings (bone in or boneless) and a drink for 7 bucks. Pizza is always good.   Now I'm just looking to find a partner to take on the giant pizza challenge with me, I want my picture on the wall!

Ordered a medium pizza and Howie bread both of which were under cooked. I also ordered 1 pizza sauce and 3 garlic sauces. I got 4 pizza sauces..... I will give them credit as they came back out and delivered the garlic sauce after I called obviously greatly appreciated
