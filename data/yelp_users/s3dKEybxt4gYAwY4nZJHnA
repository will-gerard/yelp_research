Maybe I do not have the most sophisticated palate, but I really liked my dinner here! Plus they were having $.99 margaritas. If you wanted to just live cheaply you could just have $.99 margaritas and chips and salsa and probably live the rest of your life.  all in all the service was good I am stuffed to the gills and I got very cheap tequila. What more can someone wants in life. I guess I am a very simple girl.

We brought our BMW for a simple repair they gave it back to us undriveable and wouldn't help rectify the problems that they caused. We finally took it to another shop and had to pay thousands to fix the problems that goodspeed caused. Go elsewhere.

We went horseback riding and found this little one traumatized from being stuck in a thorn bush!  At the doctors and no micro chip or collar.  She's the sweetest girl!  Above and beyond pet grooming in anthem was so nice to give Muppet a complimentary grooming when they heard her story and did such a great job!  She was covered in dirt and dreadlocks and thorns!  Now she looks beautiful!!  They said she spent the whole time kissing them to say thank u!

The bagels here are perfect, and if you get a bagel and lox, they don't scrimp on the lox or cream cheese!  Coffee is great and staff courteous.  My only complaint is they give you a bag of plain lays chips with your order.  I think I'd rather get nothing or a pickle.  Just kind of a random thing to go with a bagel.  Besides that, this place is great!

I brought my rescue puppy here and they really did such a great job with her.  Very warm staff and extremely informative.  They took a lot of time with Tipsy and made her first vet experience wonderful.  Highly recommend this great place!

Unless u r looking to party it up constantly with no relaxing don't come here!  On the weekends the pool party is going on and u constantly hear loud bass and drums ALL DAY.  I like a good party like the next girl but taking naps is part of the fun of a nice resort stay and by Sunday i was over the constant boom boom boom.  There us no escape.  Go downstairs..ding ding ding from the casino...go to ur room..boom boom boom from the pool.  NOT relaxing.  If they could sound proof the rooms i would like it.  Also this is a bit strange but the rooms are very dark.  Not enough lighting, and the hallways r like a refrigerator.

I came here while getting my car detailed at Danny's and had 2 hours to kill.  I ordered the gobbler sandwich with roast turkey, stuffing and a cranberry relish.  Oh yummy...it's even better than paradise bakery's version.  The vibe is cozy and open and has great wifi.  When the manager heard it was my first time she came over and gave me a delicious pumpkin muffin with glaze.  I'm ready to burst, but really loved relaxing here.  Great place!!
