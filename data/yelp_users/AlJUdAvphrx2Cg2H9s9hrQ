THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! Took me about 5 min to get served after several employees walked right past the counter. When We got our food the fries had obliviously been sitting for a while because the fry hopper was full and we were the only ones there. Then they tried to tell me they were out of coffee and smoothies! They need to understand that the people coming in and buying food pay there checks every two weeks. The staff is terrible and the food is awful I will NOT be back

This place is terrible! Customer service is awful food isn't very good  and you pay $5 for cheap ice cream with a little bit of toppings inside. All the workers here seem to have an attitude and when I asked for something different because my shake was terrible the girl who they said was in charge said " Hmmm do I want to be nice?" DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! It isn't worh it.

Came in here to try and make my lines a bit cheaper as I wasn't using a lot of the stuff on my current plan. I explained my situation in the store to an employee which then greeted me with an eye roll as the huffed on his way to the computer terminal. Proceeds to pull up my account them tells me there is nothing he can do. I tell him That that wasn't good enough and that I needed a better price than what I was paying which then he told me he couldn't do anything. I ended up canceling sprint because of this and now I am stuck with an ETF of $362 all because I was given incorrect information and was frustrated to the point of cancellation. Turns out after talking to a customer service representative online my bill could have been cheaper and the guy in the store just wasn't willing to check other options. I have had nothing but bad experiences with this joke of a company having people tell me "If you trade in your old device we will wave the ETA" THE SAVINGS ON THE PHONE WAS LESS THAN MY EARLY TERMINATION FEE! Don't go to this location. All they are interested in is making commission off you and aren't interested in helping you out with your terrible service or issues much like the whole entire company isn't willing to help. Seems like a qualification to have terrible customer service to work at sprint even talking to people at the corporate level and having a supervisor hang up on me at one point. You just lost a loyal customer of 4 years Nice job sprint. I will NEVER be switching back to sprint and telling everyone I can about my terrible experience with this wireless provider.

Had a great experience here! First time coming in and I was greeting like I had been coming there for months. Got recommended this place by my fiancés brother who went a few months back. I WILL DEFINITELY RETURN! Joe took great care of me asking exactly what it was I wanted and nailing it! He was very personable and was actually engaging in great conversation which was unlike other places I've been to. Very clean shop that is very well set up! Thanks to the guys over at EMG! You have gained a loyal customer!
