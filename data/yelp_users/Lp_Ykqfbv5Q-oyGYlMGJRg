Flavorful dishes and Martini Mondays!  That makes me f-cking estatic!  The Thai waitress is not that friendly, but loved my Vietnamese friend and treated us well so I was happy.

After numerous attempts to find a place to go to open at 11 for lunch (Lalibela, Bacchanal, etc), we headed to Downtown for Paisley Violin.  This place is not located in a cookie cutter neighborhood, but this place is worth a visit!  We service was a little slow, even though we were the only ones in here, but the food most definitely made up for it.  We had the Mediterranean platter and the cheese plate.  Take note My Florist Cafe, this is how you do a cheese plate...  The Mediterranean platter was overflowing with hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush, olives, dolmas, etc.  I love, love, love dolmas!  And these were amazingly fresh and I was pissed that my guy all the sudden decided to like them.  The hummus was spicy and had some chickpeas that weren't completely blended, which added a nice consistency.  Everything else of that cutting board was delicious, and I love their little panini pressed pitas!  The cheese plate was also delicious, serving a cranberry stilton, brie, feta, and a semi-hard cheese I couldn't identify.  We wanted to stay and have a sandwich, but we were already full from the two appetizers.  So my guy opted for a Kiltlifter while I had their pumpkin cake.  I wish it wouldn't have come straight out of the fridge, but it was delicious.  The cream cheese frosting and the dense pumpkin cake was a sweet way to end our lunch.  I wish I wasn't leaving AZ in a month, because I would make myself a regular here.

Oh little Korean woman, how I love you so.  You are absolutely adorable and did not realize that the man wig I was looking for was for me.  I absolutely loved the look on your face when you realized I was going to be dressing as a man for Halloween.  I know you cater to all the drag queens, but I guess you are not used to it being the other way around.  Nevertheless you were extremely helpful and took no time at all to pick out the perfect Charlie wig.  You even showed me how to put it on, all while laughing in disbelief that I would hide all my pretty hair and try to doll it up like a man.  Prices were great for the quality of hair that you are buying, and they have all this fabulous costume jewelry and eyelashes to complete the drag queen look.  I will definitely hit this place up when going to a theme party.

Six months ago I would've written a glowing review about how Cheuvront is filled with everything amazing.  From their wonderful servers to the beer, the cheeses, the wines, and the food.  Then I came in to have a drink with my brown boy after picking up my man wig for Halloween.  We got there at 3 pm, the place was completely empty.  The bartender mentioned that happy hour started at 4 and gave us the menu to glance at.  Seeing as we had an hour we just had a few beers to start, and to tide us over until happy hour.  The beer was Papago Orange Blossom (which is glorious!).  Then happy hour rolls around and my friend decides he wants mojitos.  So eventually I get one as the last drink and just asked the server which mojitos they had and I chose the pomegranate one.  The mojitos were good, the mango one tasted like dessert, a little overly sweet.  Again, everything is cool, until the check arrives.  They charged us the normal $8 for the pomegranate mojito instead of the happy hour price.  I asked the manager and he just gives me a blank stare and tells me it wasn't on the happy hour menu.  I briefly glanced at the happy hour menu and I didn't take inventory of all the items on it.  He decided not to be cool about it and left it on the bill.  I know times are tough around here but when you charge those high prices ($6.50 for a pint?!), and then screw over your customers, absolutely ridiculous.  You lost a long time customer and fan.

Came here last night with the girlies to satisfy our craving for Indian food.  We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place!  So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries.  We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd.  We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal.  Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time.  Before we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks.  So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu.  Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge!  My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim.  No skimping on alcohol here!  The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down.  We finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan.  I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it.  When the food arrived, we were excited!  Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order.  I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table.  All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves!  This food was too good!  Luckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home.  I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch.  Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now.  Overall, $20 a person including tip, with strong drinks, good food, and extras to take home we were satisfied.

The bartenders always know how make interesting shots!  Plus they have their "Slay the dragon" t-shirt for drinking all the beers.  Yeah...the shirt itself isn't amazing, but I'm down for any drinking contest.  I love the cranky old man owner.  He's a Man U fan so he's even better!  Go Red Devils!

Upon first impressions, not that impressed. After a few minutes, I'm in love. The bartneders qere amazing, hooking it up with much needed shots and a free beer when he forgot to change the keg. The bartenders love to joke around and it seems like there are a lot of regulars. Always a good sign...  I would give this place five stars if I had the food, they have tomato soup. Alas, I was out with the biggest tool in N Scottsdale and apparenty I didn't deserve a meal with this horrible "date" because I wanted to leave so I could watch It's Always Sunny. Best decision of my life!  Also, a warning to all Armadillo employees, I may attempt to steal that big red chest in the Women's bathroom. It may take a few attempts, and I may get arrested, but I have to have it!

Went here last night to grab drinks with a friend and had a blast.  The place was pretty empty in the downstairs bar so the bartender was at our service.  I didn't catch his name, but he has a shaved head and makes the best drinks!  The gin gimlet was perfect, not too strong or too sweet.  The dirty Stoli martini was even better....oh how I love a good martini!  Then he took the reigns with our drinks after that.  My friend had a chocolate martini and then something that tasted like a raspberry creamsicle.  Both were sweet but delicious!  And I had a blueberry lemondrop and an appletini.  Don't judge me on the appletini!  I just wanted a green drink!  They were all good and we were in reverse happy hour so we got the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped scallops for $5 a plate.  They were huge bites for only $5 a piece and I loved the sauces that came with it.  I'm coming back for sure, but only if the bartender is there!  I love the drinks!  Put anything in a martini glass and I'm there!

The place is cute.  I came here to enjoy a stiff drink after dealing with all the nut jobs at True Foods Kitchen.  The place is dark and sexy and a great place if you want to continue a date and get all sorts of romantical.  The bartender makes a pretty good gimlet and an amazing dirty martini.  Where's the Stoli though?  A little sad about that.  I know this is a weird thing to comment on, but I love their water.  It's a huge turnoff for me when restaurants serve water that tastes like metal, but this place had water that tasted like SmartWater.  I really enjoyed that.  This isn't a five star joint because of the redic reserved tables on a Wednesday night.  And it was reserved for a gaggle of "Woo!" girls who would not stop taking blinding pictures!

Prior to coming here last night I've only been here for happy hour after hiking Camelback so last night was first time actually eating here for dinner.  The happy hour food isn't that good.  But that's to be expected as they are giving the food away for free.  So skip out on the happy hour in the bar for food and actually get food from their menu.  Get the drinks though because their sake flights are delicious.  It gives you a lot of variety when you order the Diamond, Pearl, and Silver one, because that one really gives you an idea of what sake is.  Back to the food...the sashimi is actually pretty good.  The cut was off, but the grade of the tuna was really good.  The spicy tuna roll was amazing!  And their specialty rolls are cute, not as much variety as other places, but I do love the addition of sprouts in the roll.  The waitress was kind enough to wait on me and my friend, even though we took forever to order!  I will be back for dinner again!  But I can't say how soon, seeing as Delux is right there, and that place is the best!

I'm stuffed!  No please, no more food!  Wait, it's free?  You just want to give me extra food because you feel like it?  Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car! I swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's.  They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars.  The food alone is divine!  I love every item on their menu!  The souffles are to die for as well.  But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal.  If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!

I know I don't live here anymore, but I remember hitting up Vincent Market Bistro on the weekend after a nice hike up Camelback. This is a great place to just come, relax, and enjoy a nice weekend  brunch.  The food is fresh and outstanding, and as always, the service is perfect.  Great place to take people who are in town visiting for a truly exceptional meal.

I absolutely adore this place.  Great location, right down the street from a friends house so we never have to deal with parking issues.  Everyone who works there is really sweet and one of the older bartenders is great to talk with.  I used to stop by so often the bartender would take a few glasses of wine off the bill.  Whenever people come in from out of town I have to take them here.  They have the best bruschetta!  I have tried to recreate some of them at home and while they have been good, they are no match for Postino.  It is a great place for a relaxing lunch, romantic dinner, or night out with the girls!

Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe.

So this place has a bit of odd history for me.  When I was back in high school, this guy would always promise that he would take me to the Chart House is Redondo/Hermosa Beach if I ever gave him the chance.  Well, I never did, but then I started dating a guy and he took us here for our...wait for it...one month anniversary.  I know, totally lame, but when you're in high school one month seems like a ridiculously long time!  So we go there all dressed up and looking cute, and we don't even make it to the bread because my date is puking in the bathroom.  The waiter thought my date abandoned me because my date was with me for all of two seconds.  So needless to say I didn't get the full Chart House experience. Fast forward to 11 months later, and he takes to the one in Scottsdale for our one year anniversary.  The food was delicious and the setting was as cute as it can be for living in the dessert.  We even got to see the geese kick the ass out of the ducks for food that was laying out there.  This place is a standard, upscale, romantic restaurant.  I like more off the beaten path places, but this place is always a safe bet.

Went here right before I got my first tattoo with one of my girlfriends.  She used to work at this place back in the day and would always tell me how awesome it was.  So we stopped in since I had an hour before the tattoo artist would be ready.  We got the eggplant bruschetta to share and it was heavenly.  I believe eggplant should be included in more dishes and was so happy to find it be the star of this appetizer!  It was perfectly cooked eggplant and the bread was a crunchy balance to the soft eggplant.  We both got salads as a light dinner and I they were completely overloaded with veggies and cheese!  Next time I have to try the pizza!

Not as fancy as the newer stadiums that have been built, but I come here to watch baseball not to be seen.  The Angels play here, so I'm a little biased and would love this place no matter what. I just love chillin out on the lawn with a pint of Mirror Pond and watching the minor league players try to prove themselves with a few All-Stars sprinkled in.  The atmosphere is great as Angels fans are awesome and show much love and class for the team.  Note...park in the industrial lot across the way if you don't want to wait for hours to pay $5 and park a block closer.

I am surprised at the lack of reviews here.  This place is great, a little hidden when driving through Sedona.  You'll find this place amdist plenty of art galleries.  I love coming to Shugrue's every time I drive up to Sedona.  They have one of the most spectacular views in all of Sedona!  Their lunches are delicious and not heavy by any means, and I love how they give you a scone with your lunch.  Too cute!  It is the best restaurant to stop by if you want to enjoy a lazy lunch, sip on a couple beers or margaritas, and enjoy all the nature around you.

Everybody at the makeup counter was extremely helpful in showing me how to complete my Tobias Funke Blue Man costume and how to create a fake beard for my Charlie costume.  I loved how knowledgeable the staff was, and I one person didn't know something, they would find another girl who could give you an answer.  -1 star because it can get a little pricey to complete the look and they try to upsell.

Yes, your heart will hate you for the next few months, and you may not be able to come back here for a while out of fear of having a coronary, but this place is amazing!  Mmmm...fried chicken, waffles, mac and cheese, red velvet cake, and the Kool-Aid in the mason jar.  Far better than Roscoes!  And if you're lucky you'll spot a few Cardinals players.  I've seen some DE from the Cardinals when I was down here.

I got a tattoo by "The Danny Ross" as he was referred to by all the people at the parlor.  I had a phoenix feather done on my hip to go along with the peacock feather on the other side.  This tattoo was way worse than the first one, and at times I wasn't sure I was going to make it, but some how I powered through.  Although Danny kept joking it was his job to make me cry, then at that point, my tattoo would be complete.  Luckily, it didn't go that far. When I first saw it completely finished I was a little turned off but the size and style, but it was just my initial worrying.  Now I love this tattoo more than my first one.  I am definitely going back to Danny for my next tattoo and to get him to touch up the peacock feather.  I love his style!  And everyone in there is super friendly, coming in to check out what you're getting done and telling you how much they like it.  Side note:  A motorcycle gang hangs out there, they may seem intimidating, but they were really nice to me!

Went here yesterday to pick up a suit for job interviews.  I was feeling and looking like hell, but Holly made everything so much easier.  She helped me pick out and coordinate the perfect outfit for my interview.  A little steep for the suit jacket ($200), but it looks damn good!

I needed an inexpensive breakfast/lunch joint to take my parents after they were gracious enough to drive to AZ to help me pack and move.  Being that my Dad was in a car for six hours without any real food, I knew I had to choose the restaurant carefully.  Orange Table was within walking distance of their hotel and wasn't filled with uptight Scottsdale people.  So I knew that while my Dad would rather stop at Brackin's for a beer, or the Grapevine for food, Orange Table would do.  The place has the cute cafe atmosphere, with the beer list written on the chalkboard next to the front door.  While they weren't able to satisfy my Dad's need for an Irish root beer (Guinness), the waitress patiently dealt with his smack talking and finally made his choose a Delirium Nocturnem, which he ended up loving.  My Dad even loved the food more than his beer, which is hard to get him to admit.  He had the red leichester (?) grilled cheese with bacon, Madre has the mushroom omelet, and I had the veggie sandwich.  All of us were happy with our orders.  I loved my veggie sandwich, which was overflowing with red peppers, avocado, sprouts and the like.  And the olive bread it came on was amazing.  I had to sample the mushroom omelet, and that sauce was divine.  I would have tried the grilled cheese, but my Dad is like a wild bear when it comes to food.  So I opted not to get my hand bitten off and let him devour the thing immediately.  Cute place to grab brunch, I just wish they had salad options.

This place has awesome margaritas on the rocks.  It's not the fanciest place around, considering Scottsdale and all of it's pretentiousness is right down the way.  But it is a great place to relax and grab a nice meal and drink, especially by the waterfall late at night.  They have a pretty good late night menu too that I used to always order off of when I got off of work.  I love their carne adoba (?) plate!  They also have really good appetizers.  Cute place to drop by when you're in the area and just want to kick back.

Great pizza, albeit a little overpriced.  They are a little stingy where they charge full price even if you get the toppings on half of the pizza.  Whatever, they make a damn good pizza. With that perfectly crisped thin crust and good portion of toppings.  The service is a little slow, and the pizza does a take a bit, but it is all worth it.  Also a good place to cougar watch, for some reason they love this place!

Love this place for their Orange Blossom beer.  It's definitely the best beer I've ever had.  I'm a girl, I love the fruity beers.  The vanilla bean finish is absolute perfection!  The only reason they don't get five stars is because of the bitch servers.  Sorry I don't have a cock, but that doesn't mean that I don't want attentive service.  The food is alright, but I come here mainly for the beer!

The owner was awesome enough to open the bar up early for all us footballer fans who wanted to see Man U take down Arsenal.  I got there a little later, but the bartenders were happy to be serving drinks, and everybody was pretty wasted.  I just had a selection of their beers.  Doing the Hef, Peach Ale (I blame my guy friend for ordering it first), and the Summer.  All were awesome and the bartenders knew to keep pouring us water as the day went on. I didn't get any food, but everyone who did got it promptly and loved it.  They definitely don't skimp on the food. I am coming back for all of the morning Man U games.  Arsenal sucks!

$13.50 to play half the course with a golf cart.  That's a pretty good deal, and you can bring your own cooler filled with booze!  I never liked golfing, but I took on this course with two girlfriends.  We aren't great golfers, but this course is fun to play on and not intimidating at all.  The course is quite pretty too, set against the backdrop of the Papago mountains.  I thoroughly enjoyed attempting to golf while getting drunk.  Next time I'm bringing cigars, then I'll feel like a true golfer.

Came here last night with my friend who has not so much as ventured outside the American food realm.  He finds sushi to be disgusting and didn't even know what Indian food was.  He also continues to ask me about cooking tamales even though he knows I'm Spanish, but I think he does that for fun.  Now when he suggested dinner, we could have opted for his standby of Chili's, but that would mean severely lowering my dining standards.  So I decided to open his eyes to a new cuisine, hence the trip to Blue Nile.  I'm a virgin to Ethiopian cuisine, but I'm trying to go the way of a pescatarian, and I know Ethiopian is very friendly to the vegetarian.  This restaurant is located in the multicultural strip mall just east of Rural on University.  Total unsuspecting place of great food.  We settled into the second, larger room which has seating more traditional to that of Ethiopia.  I was excited and menu offered so many choices.  My friend was completely lost and not sure of what to do.  We both settled on the samplers, me with the vegetarian and him with the meat plate.  When the food finally came, it was arranged on this huge plate with injera at the bottom.  It didn't look like a lot to begin with, but looks are deceiving, as I couldn't finish a quarter of my dishes.  I can't remember the names, but I got the garbanzo beans, split lentils, eggplant, mushrooms, and squash.  I love eggplant, and the eggplant was my least favorite.  Everything else was just too good!  My friend loved his food, even though he was unsure of what he was eating.  It was his first time trying lamb (I don't know how that's possible at 22), but he really enjoyed it.  Surprisingly we didn't make a mess, which seemed impossible to do.  Overall, $22 pre-tip for a huge and flavorful meal, awesome deal!

I was lucky enough to get to dine at two Ethiopian places during my last week in Phoenix.  After Blue Nile, I was dying to experience Lalibela and get another taste of Ethiopian food.  I came here during lunch, and I have to say their specials were awesome.  $7.99 for your choice of 3 options of meat or vegetarian, injera or rice, and a drink.  Pretty good deal if I do say so myself.  I settled on the veggie options of the two lentil dishes and the green beans and carrots with injera.  My guy got the three meat dishes and injera.  The food came quickly, and I have to say these portions are much bigger than Blue Nile.  And I think these might be a bit tastier.  I loved the spicy lentils and the beans and carrots.  And the sauces in my guy's meat dishes were equally amazing.  Now that I've popped my Ethiopian cherry, I'm determined to learn how to cook some damn good Ethiopian food.  I doubt it can match this place, but I'm not going to be finding Ethiopian in Salem and I need my fix!

I know that most of my friends and I come here for the drinks for they have awesome food as well.  I used to come here all the time with my family when they visited because my Dad is Irish and loves any Irish pub.  They have a great Guinness beef puff pastry type deal, deliciously unhealthy mac and cheese and an awesome desserts.  I love the brown bread ice cream and their bread pudding!  And then once you've devoured all that food (if you can still move) they have great drinks and live bands!

I came here last night to experience all that is Green.  I was excited because I'm trying to go on this less meat eating path, and Green is the perfect place to do so.  The setup is absolutely adorable with the denim insulation and the VW hubcaps and car doors.  And the menu layout for all the tsoynamis is equally cute.  My friend and I got the wings to start, the red diablo, and the kung pao bowl.  The wings were really good, and I love the dipping sauce they came with!  I was in heaven with my red diablo bowl.  I loved the consistency of the mock chicken and the eggplant had been soaked in sauce for a while so it was completely mushy, just the way I like it!  I completely polished off my bowl, and my friend did the same.  Yet he was still craving the tsoynami since the guy at the counter gave us a free sample.  After going through all of our options, at which point he decided we would never be friends again because I don't like coffee, rootbeer, or mint, we decided on the rocky road tsoynami.  These things are huge and perfect to split with someone for an after dinner treat.  They definitely do not skimp on the toppings.  This place is perfect to get some flavorful vegetarian in, and it's served at a pretty good price.  I definitely have to come back and check out the salads.

Came here Saturday to watch the SC game with a friend.  I hate SC and he loves them so he was excited to see all the SC alumni packed inside.  It was too filled with Trojans inside for us to grab a table so we had to sit at the outside bar.  Our bartender was amazing!  Her name is Savannah and she is my drunken soul mate.  I loved hearing about her night, and we compared pictures of our drunken times on our cameras.  She's really cool and attentive, and a little bit of a drink pusher.  But I don't mind, I love getting drunk so I'm happy!  I am definitely coming back again, just for her!

I still cannot understand for the life of me why every one of my friends wants to go here.  It is always packed with bros and some hos, the service is terrible, and the drinks aren't even that low priced.  I guess I would understand coming here if I was a pool player, but it seems like it is impossible to get a table.  I'm sure this place will be around as long as the dean doesn't shut down the Greek life.

Every meal I have had here has been delicious.  Whether it is lunch or dinner the service and food are always at the top of their game.  It is so relaxing to escape from the Arizona heat underneath the shade of all their trees on the patio.  Love their drinks too!  Great prices and friendly service!

I don't know what else to add from all the other positive reviews.  This place is the shining star of Tempe bars, being a old house hidden off of Ash St.  And then they get points for being in the Jimmy Eat World song as the place to meet on a Tuesday night.  Great atmosphere with a decent beer selection, and the food is actually really good!  This is definitely my favorite bar in Tempe!

Definitely didn't think that Bill's Gambling hall was the place to be, but apparently it is because of Drai's.  Love that it's after hours because nothing sucks more than getting your drinking cut off.  I was a bit drunk so I can't really remember the layout of the club, but I remember thinking it was huge.  There were a lot of crazy characters hanging out at the club, but I think it is part of Drai's charm.

This place is absolutely disgusting.  Packed with people who look like they've been on a crack binge for the past month.  Screaming babies are everywhere.  Absolute hell.  Avoid especially if you've had a drink in the past week, it will definitely give you a hangover.

So another first date, another restaurant that I didn't get to chose.  I'll admit, I wasn't terribly excited about going to Sapporo, seeing as it was in North Scottsdale and I had spent my day drinking with a friend at Rose and Crown.  I'm taking date pregaming to a whole new level!  So I roll into Sapporo around 9:15, 45 minutes late for my date.  Again, I don't do North Scottsdale and have no desire to visit the land of the cougars and sugar daddies.  But I figured on a Thursday night at 9 that the bar would be laid back.  Boy was I wrong.  I forgot that cougars are living off of their exes and current sugar daddies and they have kids they couldn't give two sh*ts about.  So they were out in full force, and getting very hammered and trying to dance to Lady Gaga songs.  All the money in the world couldn't buy these hags class.  But I'm here to get some free drinks and possibly some high quality sushi.  The waitress was extremely attentive and was nice enough to remind us that the kitchen does eventually close, so we should probably order.  I can't remember the exact name of the roll I order, but I went with my usual roll requirements of spicy tuna, avocado, and scallops.  I have to admit that the sushi was fresh, so no complaints here.  And seeing as I didn't have to pay, and was pretty buzzed throughout my whole date I can give this place 4 stars.  Now if I was sober and actually paid attention to the atmosphere and prices, I know this place would drop in stars.  Much love to the server Brittany!  You are absolutely adorable and a total sweetheart!

This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here.  They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if you're looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from.  I love how clean and perfect this mall is!

Amazing sweet potato fries with the perfect aioli!  Their burgers are good, just difficult to eat as the bun is very delicate.  Love coming here after hiking Camelback for beer and fries!  They have a great beer selection!

So glad to be back in Phoenix for the weekend! Top things to do/go in Phoenix when in town for a short amount of time are go to The Vig, go to Postino, and hike Camelback.  Spring is the perfect time to hike Camelback, as the weather isn't too bad and you don't feel like you are going to die of heat stroke when hiking. Make sure you go early in the morning or later in the evening if the heat gets to be too much.  My favorite side to hike is Echo Canyon, making my best time up the mountain this weekend at 33 minutes! I may have pissed a few people off on the mountain, as they were moving at a slower pace, but everyone is incredibly friendly, so I think I'm good.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix to hit up! Great workout that pays off for the day drinking you're bound to do in town!

Perfect place to drunkenly grab a pizza during first fridays! So good! And definitely better than bianco because there isn't an insane wait with snobby hostesses! Go cibo!

This place was a huge disappointment!  With all the positive reviews I was expecting such a better experience.  I came in for a nice goodbye lunch with my  bf and experienced such lackluster service. We walked in and the place was reasonably full for a weekday lunch and we waited for a few moments before anyone at the bar even took notice.  Finally a guy (Lydel) walked by a showed us to our tables.  He plopped down the menus, shortly asked us what we wanted to drink and left.  A few moments later he slams down our waters, asks us if we know what we want.  We barely had a chance to even open the menu.  I don't know why he was in a rush...I doubt his shift was going to end any time soon.  We weren't sure of when he would be back so we put in an order for the infamous sweet potato fries and an afternoon marg for the bf.  Again, quick service, but definitely not friendly.  The fries and drink were pretty much thrown onto the table.  What's up Lydel?  Having a bad day?  Don't take it out on me.  So we put in our order for the chicken phyllo packets and the fez salad and fez kirsa.  Then we did into the fries. I was excited, because I absolutely love sweet potato fries!  But these were just mediocre, if not bad.  They were lukewarm and the dipping sauce tasted like an orange creamsicle.  It was way too sweet for my taste.  I was hoping for a savory aioli to counter the incredible sweetness.  The phyllo packets were another disappointment.  The sauce seemed so watered down and again they were just lukewarm.  Then the entrees came...the kirsa was again lukewarm!  Do they not own a real oven in this place?  Ugh...I ordered hot food and expected it to be hot.  At that point...along with Lydel's attitude and him assuming that I wanted a half salad because I should not be eating as much...I'm over this place. I was glad to leave the crappy, loud house music behind as well.

This place is absolute heaven when you are hungover.  The omelets are huge and fluffy, stuffed with deliciousness.  I love the thick cut bacon!  They definitely do not skimp on the good stuff!  I was talking about it with a guy at The Roosevelt later that night and he told me Matt drives out to Gilbert once a week for that bacon.  Definitely worth it!  The hash browns are even better.  Perfectly crispy without being burned.  Matt's will definitely fill you up at a very good price.  Loved seeing Matt at The Roosevelt that night!  He's awesome!

This place seems to get better every time I visit. The first time was a Friday night out with the guys. We met up for dinner and I had (and loved) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries. After dinne we got our drink on with a live band. The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors. And the shots kept on coming! It was a blast. The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend. It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy. The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing. It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar! We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there. Awesome night!

So I came here last night for a first date and was pleasantly surprised.  We hit up the bar so I could check out all the local art under the glass.  It was a cute touch, I love when restaurants play up the neighborhood's culture.  We got their in time for happy hour, and the Scott informed us it was a dollar off beers.  I know that doesn't seem like much, but any deal works for me.  I forgot the name of the sandwich we got but I know it had turkey, red peppers, and fontina in it.  Really good!  We also got the soup and salad...and I'm going to have to say that the tomato soup is better at the Roosevelt.  Still good, but I don't think you can best the Roosevelt at the classic grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. We eventually came back at the end of our psuedo hipster night and got the Nutella croissant.  I'm pretty sure I was incredibly drunk because I don't like to eat dessert on the first date.  Want the boys to think I eat normally, instead of like the fat chick that resides inside of me.  The one who believes that desserts are for everyone and then one communal dessert (which goes to me).  But hey, drinking makes you lose your inhibitions, so I was game.  I'm happy I did, the croissant was light and flaky.  And who doesn't love Nutella?  I don't eat it plain with a spoon like some people, so I guess I don't have as much love. Cool place, I'll definitely be back.  Probably just so I can listen to the music.  I swear they were playing my iPod, with all the acoustic Metric, The Bravery, and The Thermals.  I love you for that alone!

Went here last night with the bf while the rest of the crew went to some buffet. It's nice to take in a romantic dinner when in Vegas, espeially since you'll be doin shady shit later. We stopped at the bar for a drink first and I was feeling gin, but the bartender to convinced me to get the cablecar. It's their signature drink, and I could see why. I'm not a captain fan, but this drink tasted like candy. After a few sips of the drink we headed to our table. We had originally intended on getting the tasting menu so we could spend all of our money on booze, but the menu looked so good! We decided on the oysters, fried goat cheese salad, bacon wrapped scallops, braised short ribs, and a side of the truffle mac n cheese. Service was prompt, and we got the salad and oysters inmediately. This was along with the delcious ciabatta bread that was perfectly browner but still a little doughy. The oysters were perfection, and I loved the bits of fried artichoke on top of the salad. After we finished, we received our entrees within minutes. The short ribs were perfectly tender and the scallops were amazing. I was pissed the bf got the scallops. They came with lentils cooked in bacon! Oh...my taste buds were in heaven. The mac and cheese was good, but I love gooey homemade mac and cheese so I have higher standards. The portions are huge, and I couldn't come close to finishing half of what I ordered. Of course this doesn't mean I didn't save room for another drink and dessert. Now anyone who knows me, knows I have the rule that everyone at the table gets a dessert, plus a community one (just for me) for everyone to share. But I was so full that we only got two. The chocolate souffle that came with mint chocolate chip ice cream and the peach cobbler with the rose ice creamm. Oh my god! One of the best cobblers ever. Great complimnt to my gin fizz tropicale. This place was a definite highlight of Vegas. Delicious food, great drinks, lovely atmosphere! Perfection!!!

So I've been to LGO numerous times over the past couple years, ever since my girlfriend took me there for a hungover breakfast.  I've always enjoyed their variety of menu options, and find it a good place to take people for a quick and easy breakfast/lunch option.  The food is reasonably priced, with the exception of their beautiful and creative Tammie Coe cakes with are crazy expensive.  The market aspect of LGO gives you something to do while you wait for your food to arrive at the counter.  My favorites are any of their lunch sandwiches.  And my friend loves their egg sandwiches so much he texts me to remind me how good they are.  This LGO is too adorable for words, and is hands down the better than their Pasadena location.

Good Southwestern food in huge portions.  My friend and I came here around 9:45 last night, and the place was reasonably empty.  One couple came in after us briefly. The place itself is nicely decorated.  I love the open grill at the bar, and the smell of burning wood.  We ordered a couple martinis, gimlets, beer, and actual food.  The drinks were nice  and strong, the bartender has a heavy hand!  The food was delicious.  I got the carne adovada which was just perfect.  The pork was so easy to pull apart.  And who doesn't love a meal where you don't need a knife?  That means less effort put into eating.  My friend got the skewers and enjoyed them as well.  The presentation for them is a little nicer than the adovada, which is just meat thrown on a plate. The bartender was great, asking us what music we wanted to hear on Pandora.  He still needs to watch The Hangover so he can understand why my friend needs to stay in Caesar's Palace in Vegas.  We just might have to stop in and see him tonight.  Word to the wise: be careful about getting drunk at the bar.  The bar stools are wobbly and I can see someone eating shit while wasted.

This place is amazing!  I came here with my "brown boy", as he is so affectionately called, to grab a quick bite to eat after classes.  Still not sure why the boy invited me out to lunch if he wasn't hungry, but I was starving so I was down.  I ended up getting the something kafta and he got the spanakopita.  The food arrived promptly and the kafta was huge!  It came with two huge pieces of ground lamb, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita.  The spanakopita was also a huge for an appetizer.  I didn't have any of the spanakopita because I was so busy enjoying my meal.  The lamb was perfectly seasoned and was a great match for the addicting garlic sauce and the hummus.  Walked out of here paying less than $15.  Definitely a great meal at an amazing price!  I can see why it's packed with college students  If you are getting dessert, I would skip over the jellied treats and go for the baklava.  Nothing can beat baklava.

Cute little restaurant to stop by for a few drinks a food.  You wouldn't really notice it unless you were looking for it.  Yeah the crowd is not my taste, as I don't see the point in donning short dresses and heels for a casual night out, but to each their Scottsdale own.  I wish the bartenders were a little friendlier.  Why do they always seem to have a bit of attitude when serving my drinks?  I've served and I don't care what kind of day your having, deal and smile. Drinks are decent, still a little pricey and the servers will try to stiff you on their drink specials if you don't ask.  Food is pretty good.  I would like to come here more often, but the crowd drives me away.  That, along with the idea of getting hit on by some guy named Volt when I'm trying to eat dinner and catch up with a girl friend.  Ugh...Scottsdale douches are everywhere.

I've got to upgrade this place to a five star joint for three reasons.  1.  Their half and half plate of hummus and babba gannoush is the best I've ever had.  And at $4 during happy hour, it's a great way to start the night.  2.  Their gin and tonics are out of this world.  I don't know what they do differently, but it's a little sweeter and you can't taste the gin at all.  Warning: having 5+ of these guarantees that you will be hammered.  3.  The Vig Rig which was sweet enough to cater to two drunk girls and drop them off at their separate homes.  If only we knew that you picked up people to, then we wouldn't have had to deal with being stranded for the first part of our Saturday morning.  Even with your crowd of douches and cougars, I can't help but love you for my experience Friday night!

You had me at Hoegaarden and lamb vindaloo pasty.  I came in here a little drunk from cheap drinking at Ra and was starving!  My friend and I looked over the menu, and couldn't decide between which pasty to get.  Luckily, the waiter was extremely patient with us and even helped us decide on which one to get.  We ended up with the lamb vindaloo and the chicken alfredo.  It was only a short wait until our pasties arrived.  They were huge!  Way more than enough for two people.  Both were extremely delicious and flavorful, and I loved the sauces that came with them.  I would definitely recommend getting different pasties so you can split them up and share them.  Great food at a great price!  I love this place!

The price was a little high for a takeout place but after running on solely booze for 24 hour this shit tasted amazing! Get the chicken pesto panini or the Mediterranean salad. Lots of delicious prosciutto on the salad along with fresh avocado. Perfect to take to the sports book to watch the lions win a preseason game. Only time they will win. Same as last year. :(

Love the beer selection they have there!  It's an interesting place to take people who aren't into that kind of scene.  They start feeling uncomfortable the second the sketching begins.  I never get to stay there long enough because of my friends, but they stay a bit for the beer selection. Great location, great find!

Live right next to this place and needed to grab some beer after getting home from the airport.  Usually liquor stores have a somewhat decent beer selection, but this place didn't.  No Blue Moons, no Corona Lights, nothing but the standard Bud, MGD, Coors, and Natty Light.  Skip this place if you're doing a beer run.

Do you enjoy sitting next to crazy people who have no problems invading your space? I sure do!  Luckily Southwest has provided me with the wonderful opportunity to enjoy my favorite past time.  The flights are always ridiculously cheap, I swear the employees are high off of something because they are always happy, and I think the pilots are speeding (my flight always arrives 15 minutes early!).  All planes are pretty much the same, and Southwest goes out of there way to make a little more enjoyable at the cheapest cost.  Unless I am going international, Southwest is my go to airline!

When Pita Jungle is insanely packed, just walk across the street and I promise you will better food at a cheaper price.  Their hummus is absolutely delicious and I love their lamb!  Perfectly seasoned food and a great price!  Hit this place up over Pita Jungle and you won't be disappointed.

I have to agree with all said by Thomas S.  This is a place filled with "trendy" chain restaurants, shops which don't have any reason to exists, and everything is overpriced.  All of this is fine, all of this I take with a grain of salt because of the Coyotes and Cardinals stadium.  But then, there are the people.  Goddamn, the people here are incredibly low class and rude.  Some 35+ balding man decided to cuss me out because I made a U-turn to get a parallel parking spot so I could make the Coyotes game.  Then his parents started in on me and my guy.  Yeah, 55+ men yelling at a 21 yr old girl and her guy.  Real f-ing classy.  I can see why they hang out at Westgate, the other people aren't any better.

Yeah, I realize that Fogo de Chao is the "IT" Brazilian Steakhouse to go to in Scottsdale, but this place far surpasses it.  This place is cheaper and maintains a better quality of food.  Oh...all the meats that they have!  And everything is wrapped in bacon!!!  You definitely can't go wrong there!  I always leave this place way too stuffed, but I definitely don't hate it.  I absolutely love the grilled pineapple they serve.  One of the best dishes out there!

Came here last night for dinner and had a blast.  The bartender makes a great dirty martini and their sangria is a lighter drink when you aren't looking to get wasted during a casual dinner.  I had the super chop salad and it was delicious!  I loved the sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, white beans, sunflower seeds, and it keeps going from there!  The only thing was in the end I wanted less salad and more veggies. My friends had the mac and cheese and the burger.  They devoured theirs in seconds so I can only assume it tasted good. And lastly, their dessert is amazing!  My friend ordered the banana bread pudding and it was huge!  It took all three of us to finish it. Great place!  Definitely coming back for to explore their menu a little more.

Just came here for a sendoff brunch with the parents, and I am sad that Switch will no longer be in my city.  Their brunch menu is short, but has a good variety.  I had the crustless quiche, which was a little heavy on the cream sauce, but too good to stop eating.  Their tomato soup was a good addition on a cold day.  I am just sad that it took me this long to come for brunch!

Hey cops...just because I happened to be leaving a bar at 2 am doesn't mean I'm drunk.  I'm a tiny girl and I don't need three cop cars surrounding me and treating me like some second class citizen because it is your duty to protect and serve.  Thanks for throwing my purse on the ground, subjecting me to two field sobriety tests and a breathalyzer.  All in the freezing cold, while I was dying to pee.  Oh wait...I blew a 0.036.  I think that means I was telling the truth when I said I had two beers over the course of 4 hours.  Thanks for threatening me with jail time that didn't adhere to the law.  I loved hearing that you could give me a DUI if you thought I was drunk and my BAC was between 0.05 and 0.08.  Last time I checked the number line, 0.036 is less than 0.05.  Forget that actual crime that's going on around us, treating of legal drinking age girls like shit is more important.

This place is a total dumpster.  That's how me and my girlfriend always refer to this place.  The owner doesn't even look like he tried to make this place look decent.  I've never been there when it was packed and the empty main room in the back make this place feel like an abandoned warehouse.  Yeah, I get this place has cheap drinks, but there is definitely a reason for that.  I feel like I might contract Hepatitis from stepping into this place.  And those cheap drinks are also ridiculously small.   This place needs to be shut down by the Sanitation Department as soon as possible.

I love downtown Phoenix and how they've taken historic houses and made them into cute little restaurants and bars. Rose and crown is a perfect place to grab a few if you're waiting to get called into bianco. It's also great to meet up with girlfriends to play some pool. They have a good beer selection, and they make awesome bloody mary's at last call. I love coming here in the evening to sit out on the porch and sip a few beers.  As I've never eaten here, I can't vouch for the food. I've heard it's the standard pub fare, but nothing to wow you over.

The atmosphere and service alone make this place 5 stars. While my friend and I stumbled our way into this restaurant, there was a table full of Cuban people enjoying a celebration. They looked like they were having a blast, and were sweet enough to let us in on their party. This led to us have a 2+ hour Cuban dance party. They even made sure to get everyone in the back in on the fun!  The waitress was awesome as well. Sharing a few dances with my friend as well.  The food was good, though nothing could match the glorified fishsticks at Las Vegas in Miami. So sad about that, yet the crispy fish and plantains were delicious. Just wish that it could have been on the same level of Las Vegas.  Other than that, the food and music are rocking and the service is outstanding! A diamond in the rough in Central Phoenix!

Came here last night after leaving the murder of douches (shoutout to ben!) at Loco Patron. This place was a much needed change from the fratty atmosphere of LP. I've always seen this place when I used to work at Pure, but never found the time to make it over. I'm so glad I finally did. This place is cute and I'm sad the old owners left because I knew them from Pure and they were awesome! So my friend and hit this place up around 10 because our party of 15 had dwindled to us (You can tell who the real alcoholics are!).  This place had a few people in it, and we decided to hit up the bar.  The guy Josh was awesome!  He is my old co-workers roommate and was really friendly.  I always had a bottle of Sunshine in front of me!  And he made us a variety of shots.  Love when bartenders take the wheel and just do everything they can to get you drunk!  You were awesome Josh!  I hope to be back here soon!

Had a total blast at the club this past Saturday.  Me and my friends did the cabana with bottle service.  The club is beautiful!  The pool is amazing!  Everybody is great, from the hosts to the servers to the people!  This was my first time going all out at the club and I'm definitely doing it again!  So worth it!

Man, when my ex-bf used to work there he would always bring home the best food.  I love their channa masala and lamb saag!  They also have some of the best naan around!  If you do get dessert, the ghulab jamen is insanely sweet, but their kheer hits the spot!

As much as I love the original Postino, this one is equally amazing, if not a little better.  The bartenders here are really sweet, and make sure that you are good to drive home before you leave.  For the record...I slur my speech after a few glasses of wine, I wasn't really that drunk.  They still have the amazing wine selection, absolutely delicious bruschetta (get the tomato jam and goat cheese, heavenly!), and great soups and salads.  And of course the paninis are a godsend.  Though this one is a little farther, I think I will frequent it more often because of the bigger space and bigger bar.

This place is a total godsend!  I just got the best Brazilian wax here.  It was completely painless and Nicole was a total sweetheart.  The wax took about 15-20 minutes and I only cringed during one part.  That should sum up how great they are.  They have this special wax that is a deep purple and works wonders.  Definitely something new and amazing!  This place is worth the drive and probably the only professional waxing salon where you can get a Brazilian for $35!  $13 for AZ residents, but I'm from CA so I missed out.  This has officially become my go to wax spot!

I came here Friday night for a date, and my impression of this restaurant may be a little skewed because I was at Roosevelt pregaming with a girlfriend for this little shindig.  Suffice to say, I may have been a little drunk.  But I was still sober enough to remember how amazing the sushi was.  I didn't get to sample much of the menu because the date wasn't that hungry and only wanted two sushi rolls (If there was a rating for dates, this one is slowly getting knocked down).  I started off with a cocktail (Kiss me and like me, I think), which was good, but the bartender forgot to strain the pulp and seeds from the orange.  For dinner we got a roll with tofu, asparagus, and cucumber, and another one with tuna, cream chz, and a light tempura batter.  These rolls were delicious!  The veggie roll was refreshing, and a nice contrast to the savoriness of the tuna roll.  I wish I was with a eating champion, so that we could have tried more rolls.  While I will not be back here with the date anytime soon (f-ing BoSox fan), I will definitely come back to Moira for some tasty sushi.

The door man sucks ass!  I don't know where he gets off thinking he is so special, but he was being a total douche to my friend.  My friend had an Indiana driver's license and asked him what year he graduated high school, if he had any other ID, etc.  It was like the Spanish Inquistion.  He had no problem letting me in and I have a CA ID.  Didn't understand that.  Oh wait, I'm a girl, so I guess the tits let me get into bars with ease.  I should tell my friend to work on getting boobs, then he won't have to deal with asshole door men.  The only reason this place gets a star at all if because of the bartender who profusely apologized about the door man.  Other than that, this place is a total douche fest.  But we're in Vegas, so I guess that's to be expected.

I've been coming to this place for over a year, and thought I'd write a review before I peaced out of this state.  Compared to Bally's, this place is a palace.  Compare this location to the others in the surrounding Scottsdale/Tempe area and this place steps up their game.  The machines are always clean and you can usually find an empty cardio machine within 5 minutes during peak hours if you are flexible with your machine choice.  It's always good to mix it up.  The strength training machines are nice and I enjoy the variety compared to the other LA Fitness locations.  My only complaint is the personal trainers that hound you to join a program so they can hit on you.  Not flattering to tell a girl she needs to get in better shape, especially at the cost of $500 a month.

This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries. Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect. Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness! After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better? Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini. This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!

I came here (albeit drunkenly) to watch my friend play indoor soccer.  Yes, we were down in Tempe.  And yes, this place is way out in the boonies...but this sports complex is cool.  I was just browsing the website, and apparently they have locations around the US.  So it's a bunch of baseball fields with and indoor soccer field in the center.  The place itself is awesome because they have replicas of baseball stadiums.  And not just any baseball stadium, but one of the Big A!  They even have the big rock A.  So that is a huge plus right there.  Now I don't know about any of the baseball stadiums, but the indoor soccer stadium sells beer!  Another reason why this place is awesome.  The only problem I have is with the humidity of the soccer stadium and the plexiglass.  With the sun shining in the afternoon, it makes it hard to watch a play of the other side of the field.  Other than that, this place is great.  And while I won't be driving out for every indoor soccer game of my buddy's, I will gladly come out here to sip a few beers every once in a while!

So I've been a huge fan of the European Wax Center for months, ever since I discovered the one way out up in North Scottsdale.  I was looking at the website and discovered that they just opened this one up.  I was extremely excited as that cut 40 minutes of driving time out of my day and it was just a few blocks away from my gym.  I am completely devoted to this place, and have already begun planning my 4 hour drives to Sacramento from Salem so I can get waxed.  Tahoe is right next to Sacramento, so it won't be a total waste of a trip.  I was a little disappointed with this location however.  The front of house girls were complaining about this and that the whole time I was waiting for my waxer, extremely unprofessional.  And they don't have the plush red rug that I adore, instead it was just a standard one.  Those are my only complaints, Chelsey did a great job once she realized I was a regular and stopped explaining the procedure.  All these girls have great bedside manner and I cannot get enough of this place.  I'll be sad to leave this behind in AZ.

Fuck you Bank of America.  I lost a credit card, and I will admit responsibility for my losing of it, but should it really take me 3+ days and 5+ hours of me being on the phone to get it back?  Keep in mind, it's holiday season and I need the credit card to buy a plane ticket home. I guess you would understand that if you didn't send me to some goddamn call center in Thailand, where they can't understand a fucking word I say and talk over me when I'm trying to give them information as they are reading from a script! Then it's hold and wait while I transfer you, first to a credit card claim, then to the California banks, then it's an emergency, and then I have to go to Visa, and then back to you because you can't approve my fucking claim for some reason.  I absolutely, absolutely loved calling you guys back only to find out your call center will be down for 4 hours. Fabulous! I just got off a 14 hour shift, called you back, and you won't be up until 10:30 and I'm supposed to call you?! But it's okay, because as long as I call before 2 pm EST tomorrow, we should be good. Yeah...I don't have a fucking job and I can just take my sweet time to spend another hour plus with you.  Fuck you!

Gross, sketchy, white trash, and filled with drug dealers.  Bartender can't make a margarita to save his life.

This is the place to go if you want to dress like a hipster for cheap and with higher quality than Forever 21.

Damn! This stadium is straight up legit! The stadium is beautiful and you have so much lawn space to spread out and enjoy the game!  They have an insane amount of options for food and drink so you're bound to find something you like. And after you enjoy a couple margs or beers at the game, you can hop on over to Old Town to continue the fun!
