I am so glad I found this place, the cha shu ramen was what I got, I added an egg, it was amazing. I've had better pork but the broth and noodles made up for it big time! Phoenix doesn't have a really big Asian community esp in comparison to LA and MN so I was happy to find a place with proper good noodles. I'm a noodles freak! One of the best ramens I've had.

No bell boy to help me while I waa struggling with a bunch of things. No one offered help. No front desk service for 5 mins when I arrived. Hall ways smell like public toilets. Shitty. Def not a 4 star hotel.

Good beer, gracious staff BUT and this is a HUGE BUT I ordered the chef salad and it came with a dead fly wedged in my lettuce I'm pretty sure I did not ask for lol. The waiter took the salad off our bill but that was it. Seriously? A dead fly....  he did ask if I wanted anything else but come on after finding that in my food why would I want anything else

The food was good but what was amazing was their customer service. A waitress spilt wine, thank god it was white, on my sister who had a cute outfit on and not only was she apologetic and helpful, so were the other waiters and waitresses. The manager rushed over and handed us a 20 dollar bill for dry cleaning and a $25 gift card for the restaurant, I heard the bar staff asking our bartender to get us our drinks immediately which were comped. Way to make us happy after a sour accident!

Really sexy, warm and fun environment; it's hard not to notice right away. The food is amazing, I had the bacon wrapped meatballs as an appetizer, holy cow amazing! The croutons at the bottom of the bowl was just extra amazing-ness! I had the royale which is basically a cheese burger version and it was unbelievably tasty. The beef is so flavorful (based on the similar taste both the meatballs and royale had) you probably can't go wrong with any of the beef dishes.

Product: I wanted a 60 minute foot massage (reflexology), it was really 30 mins of head, shoulder and arms massage and the rest of the time was spent on your feet. They should really specify that they were going to "add in" these other massages as that didn't interest me. I wanted my feet massaged and focused on not other body parts. I did not care for that.   Service/technique: The reflexology was poorly done, technique is key in any massage and anyone who has had a decent massage knows that speed is not appreciated. Massages are supposed to be healing not rubbing my leg and feet repetitively really fast. I'm pretty sure you're whole body shouldn't be moving vigorously while they work on any part of your body. She didn't know where to apply pressure and ease up. It was painful, uncomfortable and boring.   Save yourself the time and go to Thai  Royal massage

Lisa is amazing, my gel manicures last over 2 weeks without peeling! She's a perfectionist which is great. Their massage therapists offering back and shoulder massage while you get your mani/pedi are unbelievably good, I was incredibly impressed and I'm a huge massage snob.

A hole in the wall but amazing quesadilla!!! The tacos were alright, the star of this restaurant would definitely have to be the quesadilla, you can't go here and not order one or two or THREE!! Lol the bread/crust/dough if the quesadilla is amazing! The salsa bar for the nachos they provide while you wait for your food is fun and there are some good selections, esp the cilantro one and I don't even like cilantro.

Christine is hilarious and understands hair so well she educated me about why and what she was doing so I too understood the dynamics of my own hair and the styles I wanted. But honestly she is so friendly and funny, she kept me laughing the entire time. She also took her time with styling my hair despite it was after hours. Cut and style for $35 and I had super ultra long hair down to my hips.

I've experienced both dinner and brunch, dinner was disappointing, I got the pork belly which wasn't crispy and tasted extremely weird (there was an barn animal smell to it which based on experience from eating good meats means it wasn't prepared right) gross. So dinner was a fail but the only reason this place is getting 4 stars is because of their brunch. Everything was amazing! I got the potato croquettes, bacon risotto and the truffle starter jar. All unbelievably yummy especially the potato croquettes! I'll definitely be going back for brunch never again for dinner

I've ordered for delivery twice now and the fried chicken comes piping hot and super crunchy, so delicious! I've also had the beef samosas, curly fries/seasoned fries and fried corn on cob, all of which were so good! Pleasantly impressed by the quality considering the establishment's slightly questionable

Love love love!! I got 2 pounds of snow crab legs with the trifecta and if you are considering other sauces, don't! As the first timer, I was a little nervous about the trifecta sauce but the moment I caught a whiff of my order, I KNEW I made the right choice. Nothing else could possibly be better than the amazing trifecta, like oh my geeerd good lol. After the crab was done, I saved the sauce and made some bomb fried rice with it. But warning! You will have days of garlic breath hahaha I also got the cajun fries which was perfection.

I've been getting my lashes done for 5 years now and have gone to many many different aestheticians in different states so i think that gives me the credibility to say Amida does good work. She's really personable and lovely which makes the time you spend laying there worth while even more so!

My friend and I both got full minx pedi $75 each.  -sloppy work, parts of my nail uncovered, started peeling 30 mins later etc.  -she cut my big toe, it bled.  -I don't mind paying the money if it's good service and I understand that it takes practice to perfect any new service like minx but if your aestheticians need more practice, don't charge a perfected service price. -my gf also noticed peeling a day after so she blew dry it (as instructed by the salon in case of any peeling) and it didn't work.  - needless to say, we were both very disappointed
