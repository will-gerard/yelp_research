Worst customer service, I spoke to the manager at 6:20pm and he informed me that he was able to take my car in until 7 pm when they close. I drove over and was there by 6:30. I then waited in the lobby for ten minutes until I walked into the shop to find someone. The manager then tells me that he can't get my car in today and to make an appointment for the following day. I explained to him that he told me to come in and he could get me taken care of and on top of that I've been waiting for ten minutes for someone to come into the shop. He said he was sorry for the wait but he was working in the Shop. Funny thing is when I walked into the shop he was standing in a circle cracking jokes with the rest of the workers. There are exactly two cars in a six car Shop. I guess these guys don't want the business. It's my fault though this is the second time something similar had happened to me here.

Clean and professional. In my opinion they have the best corals in town, great prices and the most knowledgeable staff. They can help anyone from the beginner to the most advanced saltwater addict.
