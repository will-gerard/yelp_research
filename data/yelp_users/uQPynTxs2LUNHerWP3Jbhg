Nitrogenated black IPA. This brew kicks your favorite beer smack dab in the Disney spot and giggles while you weep over it's fizzy yellow corpse.

If there was one word that could use to describe this place, it'd be "MEH". Sure, the staff is nice and friendly, the view from the patio is pretty sweet too (if you're into people watching - AND if the weather is tolerable), and holy damn if the iced tea here doesn't just about represent the perfect example of the drink... forget that hay-flavored crap every joint in town likes to dilute even more with the inclusion of ice cubes. This stuff is SERIOUS. I thought they brought me a coke by accident.   Anyhow, to the pizza. Split a pepperoni and sausage with a buddy of mine and, seriously, I've had better at bowling alleys. My lunch buddy even called me a liar when I replied with "Just fine" to the waiter's question on how the meal was.   That's about it. I'm not going to shit-talk the joint. It's perfect for where it is and what it is. I'd likely go back, but I'd try something else and f that failed me too, I'd write em off forever.   Step it up BRICK (and why do they call them that?)! Howzabout some fresh basil or SOMETHING on that bland pie?
