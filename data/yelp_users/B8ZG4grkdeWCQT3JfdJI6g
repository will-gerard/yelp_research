Ain't nothing happy about happy hour. We were having such a great time until the manager Liza came over and told us to be quiet because supposedly we were being too loud during happy hour. They targeted only us when everyone else was being loud too. I feel we were targeted  because of our ethnicity. Besides being targeted, the service was really slow, and they got our check wrong several times. I will never be coming to this place again, and will discourage any friends from coming to this place.

My husband and I absolutely loved this place! Not only was the food delicious, but the customer service was exceptional! We went there for the first time this past Sunday to celebrate our 8 year wedding anniversary, and they treated us like a King & Queen. Everyone from the hostess to our server Dean were amazing! Loved the entire experience. We will definitely be going back and will bring our friends along for the ride. If you haven't checked this place out I definitely recommend you do, you won't be disappointed!  To the Toro Latin Restaurant & Rum Bar staff: Thank you for your outstanding customer service! You really know how to make your customers feel special. If I could give you guys 10 stars I would! Thank you again for making our special day feel extra special. :)
