MacAlpines is very interesting, a restaurant, thrift store and an antique shop rolled into one.  The service is very friendly, all the waitresses are in 1950's outfits like you would expect.  The food on the other hand is horrible!!  I got a ruben sandwich, it was pretty dull and flavorless.  I also got a side hawaiian salad, which was also flavorless.  My girlfriend got a veggy burger, which seriously tasted like saw dust.  It was so gross, I felt bad for her because I had suggested this place to eat at.  We should have order a malt or some kind of soda drink, because I think thats what this place is known for.  But we were just getting a quick bite to eat before we headed to the film bar.  At the end of the meal they gave us the wrong check, which we corrected.  Well, overall the service was pretty good, but the food was so terrible that I gave this review 2/5 stars.  I'll probably try this place again just to have a coke float or a malt, but I'm staying away from the food.

Lux is one of the best places to have a cup of coffee in central Phx.  The drinks are pretty good; they used to be better a couple years ago.  Maybe they changed there espresso, who knows?  I love their new location: it's designed so well.  I love mid-century furniture, so it's still a pretty nice spot to have a cup of coffee with my girl.  I haven't had the food yet, but I will soon.  Since they now serve food and drinks, there is more of a reason to go to Lux.

I have been to the Roosevelt many times, but it usually someone else wanting to meet there.  The service is horrible, I have never one time had good experience with the service here.  The waitresses should be shot and buried in the basement, if there was one that is.  The beer selection is good, a lot of things to pick from.  The food selection kind of sucks, not a whole lot to pick from for someone that can't eat dairy.  This place is so dark, that its perfect if you have a date with an unattractive person.  Whats the point of going to meet some friends, if you can't see them in the bar?  It has a great location and its pretty nice that the bar is a house.  There is still way better bars then the Roosevelt, so this would be last on my list as far as places to hit up in central Phx.

I stopped by this place because a friend had recommended them, so I thought I would try them out.  I knew I needed brakes and possibly rotors, and I tend to wait to the possibly last second to get them done (which is costly and dumb).  They were very friendly and fit me in with an appointment for the following day.  They had replaced my brakes and rotors within 3 hours of bringing in my car for $430, which is about an average price.  They did try to sell me on a tire rotation and a oil change, I declined.  But at least they didn't try to sell me on an air filter, I'm so annoyed when places try to do that, hell I can replace that myself.  I would go to this place again, they're easy to work with and they seem pretty honest.

First off I noticed that the patio was huge, a large open space.  Kind of nice, but it doesn't look like they have done anything too spectacular with it.  The waiter was nice and friendly, but overall not a great server.  I didn't even get my drink until after a 20 minute wait and I had to ask for it again.  I ordered a bacon cheese burger, which was huge, but overall fell short of flavor.  The fries were kind of boring and soggy.  As I complained to my girlfriend about how many pickles were put on my burger (7-8), she pulls a pickle out of her eggs.  What the hell, lol.  Shortly after that, the waiter noticed that there were a ton of red peppers left on our friends plate.  I guess the kitchen didn't get her food right either, she asked for no peppers.  The waiter had taken the drinks off the bill, which was nice.  But he should have taken her meal off the bill.  I wasn't impressed with the food or service.  This place lacks consistency, according to all these reviews.

My favorite coffee shop in phx,  their espresso is incredible.  Great mid-century decor, friendly staff, great music.  A way better cup of coffee then you'll find at lux.  My only complaint is that they close on Sunday really early, they need to extend their hours.  This place is still one of my favorite coffee spots in Phoenix and I highly recommend it.

I got my haircut by Amber the owner, really great cut.  I'm very happy with the cut and just overall service.  This is definitely a 5/5 star place, the reviews speak for themselves.  The price is about average for a mens cut, I definitely don't have any complaints.  I will recommend my friends go to her because she is awesome!!

Right off the bat... its a little ghetto.  A hole in the wall place w/ not much charm at all.  The staff is friendly and a little slow moving, but they make up for it in other ways.  The food is amazing, reminds me of my moms cooking.  You know.... southern crap thats f'ing terrible for you.  They're way over priced for the presentation of the food and look of the restaurant.  But then again, it taste really good.  Their proportions are large and you will definitely be full afterwards.  If you're more interest in the look and feel of the restaurant, then pass on this place.  But if you enjoy soul food, this is the place for you.

Great place to have a drink and watch a movie, so much better then going to a regular theater.  Why spend the same price you would for over priced popcorn and a coke... instead just get a couple beers.  I much prefer this place, then your traditional theater.  My only complaint is that I wish they had more of a movie selection, either way still a cool place to see a flick.

My girlfriend took me to windsor for my birthday last night, I was very impressed.  The look of the restaurant was very clean and modern, the service was incredible.  The food was delicious, I got a pulled pork sandwich.  The cocktails were also very tasty.  I don't usually give a place 5/5 stars, but this place is definitely up there and worth going to over and over.
