Great selection of fried catfish, whiting, tilapia, bass and cod. I have tried all except the bass and thought all were very good. I especially liked how they used just the right amount of batter.  They also butterfly the fried shimp.  Great spot for fish.

Still one of the top 5 buffets in Las Vegas for value. My favorites are the prime rib, fried chicken, collard greens,  kulua pork, and the pound cake. The weekend champagne brunch is also a great value at under $20. Tue night Bbq is a stand out with Beef ribs, pork ribs, and bbq chicken.

I think they have the pricing for tbe buffets set about $7.00 too high. I dont like giving negative reviews but I can't see the value in paying for the quality of food and the matter that it is presented in. The carving station and sushi were good, the desert station was not appealing at all. Table service was friendly but not efficient.

$7.99 with a players card.  Hamburgers made to order are okay. Roast beef carving station not enough to justify regular price of 10.99. Main St. Better value.

I am very particular when it comes to my movie going experience. I only go to certain Harkins or AMC theaters. But we made a special trip here to see The Hobbit in 3D HFR. We had a very nice experience. Comfortable seats like Harkins. They also refill Harkins cups for $1.50. The restrooms were clean and well maintained. Good popcorn and sodas. We will be back.

We been here a couple times now and have always received fresh hot food. The philly cheesesteak and the 57 burger are standouts.They have a soda fountain so you can share drinks. A good value for lunch or a late night snack.

My favorite little Greek spot. I like the Greek salad w/ Gyro meat and the spinach pie. The rice pudding is also good. They give you a choice of chicken lemon rice soup or bean soup with every order. The place is always clean and the service is great.

Great service, and very fast installs. There are worth the drive, give them a call before you take your headlight problems to the dealership.

I really enjoyed my experience at M&M, both times I visited I had the Oxtails smothered in gravy. If you like Oxtails or have had oxtail soup, I'm certain that these will be the best that you have had so tender and meaty they come right off the bone.  The pork chitterlings are also very very good for those who eat them. If you don't eat them but wanted to try them, this would be the place to do it.   The gravy they make is also top notch.  I sampled the collard greens, okra, red beans and rice and yams, all were very good.  A little corn bread pancake comes out with every meal.  The portions come in full and half sizes, the full sizes can probably be shared so you leave room for dessert.    The only negative part of the experience would be the climate in the restaurant during the summer months can be a little warm for some but that doesn't take away from a great soul food restaurant that is on the strip.

Former member of Lifetime Fitness, Planet Fitness has everything you need to work out except for the pool at half the price.  The club has been open a year now and everything still looks new the bathrooms in the showers are very clean.  I love the aqua massage tables and the massage chairs.
