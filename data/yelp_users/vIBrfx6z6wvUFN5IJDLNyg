My boyfriend and I went for Phoenix Lights and it was pretty cool.  The zoo did an amazing job putting up all of the light displays and it just looked beautiful.  There were plenty of employee's around to take your picture (and to keep you from getting into places you shouldn't).  I was pleasantly surprised that they did have holiday booze station with beer, Kahlua, Schnapps, and peppermint tequila.  If there was any draw back at all it would be that the zip line was too short.  A great date night and/or family night event to go to.

This is the first time that I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory and I am a fan! We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and it was pretty good. The bread that they brought out was I think dipped in a whole vat of butter, the complementary bread they brought out was actually better with the dip. For the main dish i got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was awesome. The flavor and the crispy topping brought everything together. The veggies and the chicken were plentiful and covered in the sauce. I brought it home because i couldn't finish it all and it was just as good reheated. The wait staff was very polite and knowledgeable.

Love it!  It was pretty far away from my home in Glendale, but I think it was worth the trip.  We had girls night here a couple weeks ago.  We had a cute waiter, who helped us with our wine choices.  We ordered 4 different types of bruschetta and they were divine!  Will defiantly come back even though it was a little pricey It still wasn't that bad considering the quality.

I love Arby's and this location is never skimpy with the meat on the sandwich.  They are super friendly to me and my dogs.  What other fast food restaurant gives your dog (when you are going through the drive through) a bone!

Love this zoo!  Well maintained easy to see all of the animals.  Love the fact they have a baby exhibit that houses all of the new baby's.  They also have groupons and Entertainment coupons which is awesome. They have rides, a petting zoo and a BBQ place there that is rockin.

3 of us went out to dinner there because we had a gift card and all 3 of our dishes were disappointing. 2 of us got the 2 for 20 deal, boneless wings (which weren't bad but honestly how do you mess up boneless wings), the new Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp (the other guy got the same meal) and shrimp and i got the Fiesta Lime Chicken. Parts of the chicken were burnt and dry; and the Bourbon Chicken and Shrimp lack flavor and complementary sides. The service in the bar where we sat wasn't too bad though... the food just sucked.

I have always loved Red Robin.  I went there and had the blue cheese burger (not sure if that is the real name of it) with a side of steamed carrots.  Every time I go there is a different cook, so if you are like me and like a lot of blue cheese on yours I suggest you ask for extra!  The carrots were actually nice and soft, I hate when restaurant say that they steam veggies and they are still hard.  The service is always speedy and polite.

They aren't very good at keeping the client informed on their case.  They are nice enough but you have to call them otherwise they just won't get in touch with you at all.  I don't know anything thing else about them because I dropped them.

Went there on a night where there were live bands.  Definatley a fan, the crowd and the band gets into everything.  There is also a nother section you can go to if you arent in to the band.  It has a pool table and vidoe games.  The bartenders are pretty hott and are good at paying attention to all of the customers and not getting swamped.  Definatley going to come back here!

They front desk staff is really friendly and understanding, I was two minutes late and didn't have the new patient paperwork.  I was taken back right away by Debbie, she looked over my paperwork and asked if i had any concerns.  Throughout the procedure she was very good about talking to me and letting me know how much longer I had, and she paid attention to my body signals (pain).  The biggest thing to me is that Debbie remembered that I was a human who needs to swallow!  She would give me swallow breaks and she was very good at placing the sucker thing to get ride of the extra spit. At the end the doc came in and talked to me for a little bit got to know me checked out my teeth and I was done.    I also got free toothbrush, floss, toothpaste, and mouth wash.

I am so a Diamondback fan now! Just moved down here and went to the game to get tickets. Walked up to the ticket booth and asked if they have a military discount... they did. We got amazing seats right by the home plate for only $25 a piece. Recommend walking around before you settle on what you want to eat and drink they have a pretty awesome selection of food and booze, everything is kind of expensive... but it is cheaper than a Cardinals game. We almost got hit by a foul ball, we saw the freak in action, and a grand slam! Plus there were 2 drunk guys a couple rows back who kept things fun with their various crowd pleasing chants. We were so impressed we are thinking about getting tickets for next year.

It is a cafeteria style place and the food is amazing.  The sweet tea on tap is not sweet! haha But they have old school soda bottles that are so good. I had the ginger ale. I had the pull pork, mac and cheese apple sauce.  Everything was soo amazing.  Def recommend getting the apple sauce as a dessert it is so good!

Drove there from Surprise, AZ and it was the best lunch i have ever had. Boyfriend got a BBQ chicken salad and I got a Brie and Turkey sandwich. I would defiantly go back, the price was good, food was good, and the people there are really friendly. Plus the Coco Mania Espresso Drink was to die for!

I went there for lunch because I had a hankering for Mexican and a Groupon.  The service started out good but didn't finish that way.  We were honestly 7 minutes from dinning and ditching.  After we got our food we didn't see our waitress for another 30 minutes!  The food did not make up for it either.  I am pretty sure they microwaved everything.    I go out to dinner to get food better than what I can make at home and this fell way short of my standards.

It a God send being out here in the almost boonies.  You can get just about everything there, hot food to go, random food staples, stuff for your farm and so on.  Everyone is really nice and helpful.

My boyfriend and I went He got the Cali tacos which were good but didn't really have a lot of taste. My BBQ sandwich was good but didn't come with BBQ sauce! The meat was really delicious and tender but the bun was really sogggy and greasy. The sandwich end up making my stomach hurt.  The portion size for both meals was perfect though. Overall probably won't go back.

Three of us went here an hour before they closed (9pm) and were seated right away. We ordered the alligator appetizer and a cup of lobster bisque. The alligator with the Cajun sauce was deli-sh! My cup of lobster bisque was creamy with chunks of lobster in it. Probably one of the best that i have had. When ordering our waitress was very helpful, we ordered Costa Rican Mahi Alexander, Crawfish Etouffee, and the Soft Shell Crab. By far HANDS DOWN the Alexander was the best dish. It offered a little bit of everything and the flavor or the sauce plus the amazing dirty rice. OMG it was amazing and i am kind of upset that i wasn't the one who ordered them. The Etouffee was colorful and deli-sh the crawfish were really soft and easy to chewy plus the flavor the sauce thy were in was amazing. I ordered the soft shell crab... i had never had soft shell crab before. It was pretty good! I would recommend that you put a little of the Cajun sauce that was served with the alligator.

This place is how burgers are supposed to be. My favorite is the BBQ burger with green chilies very messy but very worth it.  The place is super small and old fashioned.  The burgers are cooked to order and delicious.  Th milkshakes are intensley thick and wonderful.  Staff are friendly.  Best place to go for a burger.

We love taking our dogs to this place!  It is always super clean and they KNOW your dog.  They check up on them after each visit. And you can tell when they are in the exam room with you that everyone there is really a dog person. When we have had emergency situations they have been very flexible getting us in at a  decent time. The prices are reasonable and they even give a military discount.

We left the Cardinals game early so we could get a good seat and i am glad that we did. We had Josh as our waiter and he really knew his stuff and had a great personality. As always the beer selection was overwhelming but thankfully you can never really go wrong with a good waiter. I had the Cuban Dip, the sweet tomatoes and the pickles beautifully were beautifully complemented with the Au je sauce. My boyfriend got a half rack of ribs that literally fell of the bone with the first bite. The BBQ sauce was very tasty. But i think the best thing about the meal was the creme of corn. Neither one of us were a fan of creme of corn but this was magical. ;)

The curry here is amazing.  I haven't really explored anything else. I am a fan of the spring rolls and the yellow curry.  They ask you how hot you want your curry so even people who don't like spice can still enjoy the delicious curry. The only down side is that there isn't a big seating so sometimes there is a wait

My boyfriend and I went there after spending the day at the zoo. In the beginning the waiter was awesome. She split a bowl of Lobster Bisque that was AWESOME. And he actually convinced me to get the Ma-hi Ma-hi instead of the crab legs i had my heart set on. The Ma-hi Ma-hi was good, the steamed veggies that came with it were a little undercooked in my opinion but over all everything was fantastic. My boyfriend got the rack of ribs (he was planning on sharing the crab legs with me). He said they weren't "fall off the bone good but were still pretty good." The waiter could have done a better job of checking up on us (we ran out of drinks fast, but other than that we give him 2 thumbs up. At the end of dinner our waiter even brought us a couple of hot towels to wash ourselves up with.

We went in for Mother's Day without a reservation.  The manager meet us at the door and was able to seat us right away.  Our waitress was named Stephanie and she was so awesome. She was very friendly and took the time to small talk with us even though they were crazy busy. She provided me with my free Mother's Day mimosa and gave us time to look over the menu.    We did the Mother's Day special and had the bruschetta, green chili burger and the BBQ burger with brownie for desert. The bruschetta was pretty good nothing to special but good.  The green chili burger was decent, the pico de gallo on the burger was a bit too much for me.  The BBQ burger was flippin amazing, I found myself hoping my boyfriend would get full so I could eat some of his (he did share).  The brownie was amazing and warm with warm chocolate drizzle that went amazing with the vanilla ice cream.

I love this place!  I have only been for night festivities  but it has always been awesome.  There are normally live bands and no cover charge, for those that want something quieter they have another room that is farther away.  The outside fire pit is the coolest one you will ever see.  The service is for the most part good.  The Reuben sliders  are amazing and the fish with the fish and chips is good.  the fish just has a little too much batter for me.

I just finished my first Bark Buster Consultant and I am so excited and impressed.  My trainer was Michelle Willey and she is so awesome.  I love that they come to your house and walk you through everything.  I have to say that at first I was really skeptical of this kind of training- "They really think that they can fix my dog in 3 hours?!"   The first hour she went over everything from the view of the dog.  It is amazing once you they tell you all this info how much of it makes sense.  Then the second part of the consult is the training techniques.  She was actually training me and my dogs.  There method of discipline at first makes you feel really silly - especially when your neighbors are spying on you- but when you see how well it works you will get over it.  Plus the more you use it with your dogs in the beginning the less you will have to do it. In the end i am extremely proud of the progress my dogs have made today and excited to have well behaved dogs!  1-877-500-BARK (2275) www.barkbusters.com

I freaking love this place!  It is really l close to my house and it have $1 jello shots!!!  Need I say more.  They are open for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and nightlife.  The food isn't that good but the nightlife is really why people go.  They have a small dance floor and have karaoke and a DJ on certain nights.  Outside there is volleyball, basketball, life size beer pong, horseshoe, live bands, and corn-hole.  The drinks are all reasonably prized.  Most of the bar staff are really friendly and really want you to have a good time.

I love going to Ace for the simple fact that i almost never know what i am doing and there is always someone that is there right when i walk in the door. Whether i come in to get a new key or trying to do a home improvement project. I have gone up there several times and just shown them a picture of what is wrong at home and they know exactly what I need to fix it.

Theresa I tried the new enchilada sub and I LOVED it. The meat doesn't look good but it tastes really good.  What really makes this Subway awesome is Theresa.  She is really helpful walking me through on what she thought would be the best for the new sandwich she was funny.  And had dog treats for our dogs outside. And she didn't put too much veggies on but not too little. Between Theresa and the new sub I am def going to come back.

I have only been here for Lady's night (Friday) .  Everyone was really nice and helpful.  They even took all of our pictures with our targets.  It is an inexpensive way to blow off some steam at the end of a long work week.

The only reason I keep going back here is because my kid is addicted to the smoothies.  The kitchen is not very clean and just looks gross. All of the food is microwaved pretty much so it isn't that good.  But it is a pretty cheap reward for my kids after her therapy on Friday's so that's ok. They do have a lot of specials on food and smoothies which is nice.

I have been to Booty's 3 times and generally the service sucks.  The second time I practically had to go into the kitchen myself to get some silverware.  And the place is called Booty's but no one who works there a has a good looking booty. ha ha The wings are really good though and event though you have to wait forever to get them it is worth it.  Every time we order no matter how busy or slow it is is ALWAYS take at least 30 minutes for wings.  It should never take that long to put wings on the table.  This last time that I went our waitress was pretty attentive but it still took 45 mins for our wings.  I can't wait until B-Dubs open again.

I love this place!  The beers, staff and the atmosphere make this place as amazing as it is. The patio is dog friendly (idk about at night), has misters, corn hole and comfortable seating.  Inside it is very laid back seating great fro groups.  The bar has 6 wines and about 35 beers on tap.  The bartenders and waitress are very knowledgeable and will help you choose a beer that you love.  We prefer to have them help us create a sampler (6 beers) and go from there.  The food is even great!  We have had the pretzels which are amazing the beer cheese makes it.  The pretzel itself is much softer and not as salty as you are probably used to but sooo good.  I have also tried the spam sliders which was AMAZING! haha I know what you are thinking spam gross but it is good and you have to try it!  Only bad thing that I have to say is the parking SUCKS! Carpooling or public transportation are a must!--- Or bring lots of quarters.

I love that the store is small and has exactly what I need.  I started coming here after Petsmart and the store staff was very helpful when picking a new dog food for my dog.  They even told me which food has a loyality reward program.  And if they don't have something you are looking for they will order it or give you the name or web address of someone who does.

The people here are why I come back to this place to give blood.  They are all friendly and nice, and if you are regular they remember you r story and ask you about your life.  There is always someone near by checking up on you to make sure that you are comfortable.  There are blankets and pillows while you are in the chair and they are generous with there snacks and drinks.    They also have started allowing people to do the questionnaires online and just bring in a one page print out saying that you did it.  This save A LOT of time.
