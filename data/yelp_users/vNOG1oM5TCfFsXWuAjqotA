Almost walked out of the place.  Having spent 7 years working in the restaurant industry, I have learned that there's a good correlation to condition of the bathrooms and the overall hygiene in the kitchen.  While some places can slip on hygiene (provided they deep fry everything and serve it hot), sushi cannot.  Poor hygiene leads to an unhappy digestive system.     Had I not already ordered my food, I would have left after using the restrooms.    I stumbled in here by accident and I would be happy to not try it again.    Overall the quality and flavor of the sushi was about as good as a supermarket.  It was not bad, per se.  But, it certainly was not good.  I would not recommend Ishi for sushi.    The atmosphere gets a 2 out of 5.  Service gets a 2 out of 5.    I recommend a "pass" when you are in the mood for sushi.

Cold sushi!  Hot waitresses!    I have never seen so many hot waitresses in one place.  I found the sushi to be above average.

Hands down (pun intended), the best massage facility that I have ever visited.    Urbana (not pronounced like the place where the University of Illinois is located - soft "a"s) sets the benchmark for all massage places.  I am not saying this lightly or jokingly.  I am serious.  Out of the 50 or so massages that I have had in my life, Urbana is on the top of the list.    The therapists are top-notch.  They are professionals.  People who are serious about massage.   They are not the types of people enjoy giving back rubs and want to make some extra money.  Urbana's therapists are serious about the art.  They are well educated and very talented.    The atmosphere is ideal: comforting, private, and very tastefully decorated.  It is clear that the proprietor put a lot of thought and effort into planning this unique spa.    The thought of combining a healthful massage with a rejuvenating tea bar is unique but seems so obvious.  After you have your massage, you can kick back and enjoy one of the 70+ different teas that they offer.     Urbana is the ideal place to get a massage.  Try it and you will not regret it.  ** Update - I recently had another massage there.  All I can say is "!!!"  This place is awesome.
