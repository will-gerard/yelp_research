Terrific sliders! Great Italian beef... way better than Lukes Italian beef.  This is a little hole in the wall that has been there forever.  It's one of those gems that all the people in the local neighborhood know about! The Italian beef was out of this world.  Juicy, meaty, and the broth was salty and rich!  I will definitely go back.

Sub par. Go to Taco Bell instead. This place is terrible! Apparently it holds some memories for my wife ("It used to be good"), but it was not good.  All the food is bland and basically just filler. Stay away.
