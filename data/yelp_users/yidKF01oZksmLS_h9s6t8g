This is one of our go to, tried and true places. It is a great mix of Tex-mex and comfort food.  We love to sit at the bar for the fantastic happy hour or have a nice dinner at a table. Waitstaff is always great. The food is terrific! The is osso bucco is the best I've had. Tender and so flavorful. The beef stew is fantastic as well as the stacked enchiladas. We love the Hoppers Poppers and bacon wrapped shrimp. The Aztec soup is so flavorful and light. A great light meal with a salad. They have a terrific brunch with bloody Mary's and mimosas. Miguel's Mule, the Paloma and the sangria are all delicious!

BEST green chili pork and always a very friendly waitstaff! Love to dine there! We have been often for drinks, lunch and dinner. The pig dip is fantastic and their daily specials are always great. I once had a lemon pizza that was truly to die for. Light and flavorful. Wish it was on the menu all the time.  Really have never had a bad meal. Delicious fish also.  Love the atmosphere too.

Delicious pizza and the beet salad is fantastic. Loved the cauliflower gratin too. It is a favorite place to meet friend for a leisurely lunch with some delicious wine. Soup of the day is always very good too. Love the history of the building and the pictures showing it. My MIL used to get her hair done there. Fun piece of Phoenix history for a third gen. Phoenician.

Love love love! We go on average once a week. Love the meatball pho with added veggies and the grapeleaf wrapped beef rolls. I have also had the vermcelli salad with lemongrass which is delish but am addicted to the pho.  Have also gone to Da Vang and it is great too. Love that reviewers call them "competitors". I am pretty sure it is the same family but not sure.

Love this place! The Otro salad is one of my favorite salads. The chicken soup is also delish! The Paella Mexicana and the Pollo Asada are wonderful too. Tacos are street tacos and yum! Have a Poloma to cool off in the Phx heat.

I LOVE this place. Not only is crab one of my favorite things to eat, I love the variety of flavors to choose and spice level. I also love that you get your own bag. Really fun. I always get the snow crab with sausage and the legs are HUGE. Not your typical snow crab. The veggies are also a great addition. Real veggies, not just corn and potatoes.  We have the crocodile bites and they were good- tasted like chicken .  Very fun atmosphere but it can be loud and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Have a few drinks and enjoy the fun. The waitstaff is really fun!

We have wanted to eat here for a few weeks and finally made it in. The inside was reserved for a private party so we tried sitting outside. There were air conditioners and it was pleasant, not cool but totally comfortable. The patios are huge with tables, couches and grassy areas. Really a beautiful, contemporary space.  The GM and the waitstaff were so friendly and great offering suggestions and chatting. We ordered the crispy chicken meatballs and the clams for apps. The meatballs were ok- the sauce and chilies they sat on were great! Maybe more of the sauce? If you didn't get a bit of sauce, chili and cilantro with the meatball it was a bit bland. The clams were good but had bacon and beans. I'm more of a lemony garlic sauce clam person.  We ordered the beef ribs with cilantro lime fries and the roaster cauliflower to share. Jeez! Good thing we did. There were 5 ginormous ribs and they were SOOOOOOOOO delish. I am not a huge beef rib fan and I could have finished them off but would have seriously paid for it. The fries wet crispy and tangy with the cilantro lime. I  cauliflower but this was just ok. Again, the sauce it was sitting on was really good. it was almost a head of cauliflower, sliced in two. I think we would have preferred smaller pieces with the sauce mixed in.  For the four items and three drinks (they have a delightful rose on he menu) it was $100.  A bit on the pricy side but the portions were HUGE! We brought one whole meal home of ribs, fries and cauliflower.  Will definitely return!

Really love the drinks here. They have the most unusual drinks that you say "who could possibly come up with this??l" because the ingredients are so different but I have had several and they are all delicious. I can't even remember what's in them but they are so good!  We did have the fried chicken skins. If you can get past what your eating, they are delicious.  Fun atmosphere, small and quaint. We will be back for dinner to try the other items that are as unusual as the drink menu.

We stopped in to see what was new in this space. What a fun surprise! The staff was fun but we were the only ones in the place but it was a Wednesday at 5 or so. We chatted with the bartender and ordered some drinks. Great, inventive drink menu.  We played some games, they are all FREE! I just wish there were a few more "girly" games like Pac Man, Frogger, Qbert or Donkey Kong. I knew a few of them but my hubby knew most.  We ordered the sliders, tots and fried pickles. Not the best food. Tasted like frozen food thrown in the frier. It was edible but not really good. They did have fun nostalgic treats but we didn't try them.  It would be a fun place for a group to hang out for an evening. Games (video and board) and great drinks.  Work on the food and it will be great!

We unfortunately had a not so great experience. We went on a Thursday night and needed to wait for a table. Hostess seemed a bit scattered and we told her we would wait in the patio and get a drink and app. Service and the calamari was great out there. Then it went downhill.  We were told our table was ready right after ordering a second drink. The waitress said she would bring it to our table. We were sat at our table and waited, and waited and waited. No one so much as came to bring us water for at least 10 minutes. We stopped two of the waitstaff asking for our server and our drinks, explaining they were following us from the patio. 20 minutes after we sat down our drinks "found" us.  We finally ordered a kale salad to share and an entree each. About 25 minutes later the salad and my husbands hamburger came. Um, ok. We were sharing the salad as a started but we rolled with it. Not two second after the food was dropped, another server asked how our food was. Well, we have not tried it yet...... We finished both (they were delicious by the way) and my pizza still had not shown up even though we had asked 2-3 times to other servers. Our waitress had not come back to check on us and finally came back to see if we needed anything else and I mentioned that we still had not received my pizza. It took another 15 minutes to get. It was very good also.  We will try it again in hope the service has improved because the food was great. They were all friendly but very inattentive and unskilled.
