Love it here! The management is friendly, maintenance is quick to respond to requests, and the common areas are well-kept. I appreciate that we are always kept informed about any news via e-mail. I also feel like the community is safe--I haven't seen any issues of theft, vandalism, etc. Everyone we've met in the complex has been nice.  Our apartment overlooks a park, so it's great to see trees and greenery out the window. The pool area is also a really nice place to relax and have friends over for a BBQ.  I saw a few reviews about the staff being sticklers for rules--this is true. Things like keeping current tags on your car and adding longterm guests to the lease are strictly enforced. Just a heads up if you are used to more relaxed management. Fortunately we're (usually) on top of things.  The rent isn't cheap, but it's certainly reasonable for what you get, especially when compared to other apartments in the area. We're renewing our lease for another year.

My friend and I were looking to add some exercise into our schedule, so we each purchased a Groupon for ten classes at Dahn Yoga.  I was expecting some typical yoga classes--you know, downward dog pose and such...  The experience ended up being completely different than I expected. At Dahn, they practice a traditional Korean style of yoga that focuses highly on meditation and affirmation. I did break a sweat during the first portion, although I am not very graceful and had trouble with many of the poses that were unfamiliar to me.  During the second half of class, we had to do a few things I was NOT used to. For instance, we had to listen to strange jungle music and kick our legs up in the air for a good five minutes. I'm pretty shy about that kind of thing, so I felt really embarrassed and was wondering what I got myself into. But during the following meditation portion, I began to feel really relaxed. We were supposed to feel an energy ball between our hands, and it actually did feel like something was there.  I left the session feeling very relaxed, limber, and destressed.  I've gone to about seven classes since, and am kind of hooked.  I always go in feeling stressed from work and life but leave feeling great! The exercise and stretches really help me to loosen up, and the meditation time is nice as I don't get a lot of "quiet" during the rest of my week. I'm becoming less and less inhibited about the exercises I find "strange."   I should also mention that the instructors are SO nice. They have, on more than one occasion, spent extra time with my friend and I after class to make sure we have the poses down and feel comfortable.   Since my Groupon expires soon, I went ahead and signed up for more classes. The instructor was really nice about helping me choose a membership that works with my budget.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend Dahn if you're looking for typical exercise-focused yoga classes, or are easily embarassed. But if you want to try something new and have a great outlet for destressing, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try. They occassionally will offer free classes for people to come and check it out.  A few notes for new patrons:  -Wear socks! The ones with the "grip" at the bottom work great! -You don't need to bring your own yoga mat--the studio's floor is a big mat. -Occasionally there are partner activities, so it's nice to come with a friend. -Don't expect "typical" yoga, but be open to something new!

I'm so excited that a friend introduced me to this place! I returned to Arizona in September after living in Japan for two years, and I had yet to find a lot of the "staple" foods I enjoyed there. Nagasaki Grill offers really authentic udon, ramen, tonkatsu, curry, etc.  The plain but comfortable inside is authentic too. Eating there felt just like being back in Japan.  It's important to note that Nagasaki Grill's food is in no way "fancy" or upscale. It's what you would expect if you walk into a small neighborhood joint in Japan where locals grab a quick bite after work.  In other words, just good plain food. The service is quick, but the husband and wife run the place alone and don't fawn over guests at all.   I would give Nagasaki 5 stars, except that it's SO uncomfortably quiet in there. I had to whisper so my voice didn't echo obnoxiously. :)  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!

I love Korean food, so I was excited to try Hodori.  The first time I went, I thought the prices were a little high, but not unreasonable.  The "kimchi pancake" was tasty, but my bibimbap was quite bland.  As for the wait staff, they were not very friendly, but brought everything out on time. Overall, I was content with the experience, but certainly wasn't impressed.   However, my second experience at Hodori was awful.  We literally waited at our table for an hour to have our order taken--they told us the kitchen was too backed up to receive any new orders. (Meanwhile the two tables around us ordered and received their dinner.) We decided to leave, but they assured us we could order and that we would get our food in twenty minutes.  In reality, it took another hour and ten minutes to get our food.  I tried a kimchi soup this time--it was alright, but not worth the wait or price.    I NEVER stiff wait staff, having worked in food service myself. But I planned to make an exception this time, as waiting to be served for over two hours after being seated is ridiculous. However, they added a mandatory 18% gratuity to our bill.  Even thought this meant a few dollars per person, we all felt so cheated for being forced to pay for such poor service. They did apologize at the end for the wait and brought out complimentary ice cream. But at that point, we were just ready to get out of there.   I would NOT recommend this restaurant and will certainly not be returning there in the future.  UPDATE: It's one thing to have bad service, but I spent the next day throwing up. On my birthday. I mean, really? And no, it wasn't because I'm not used to the food--I've had actual Korean food in Seoul without any problems at all.

I completely forgot to update and mention that I spent the next day throwing up. On my birthday. Again, what a terrible experience!

This is by far my favorite Viatnamese place in town. I've been going there for about 10 years now, and love it every time.   I often order takeout as well, and it's always ready lightning fast!  I have so many favorites, so it's difficult to make a recommendation. But the egg rolls (#1) are a must have! The spring rolls (#2) are also tasty if you're looking for something a little healthier.  For entrees, I love the chicken pho (#14) when I want something simple or the rice and egg noodle soups (#18 and #19?) when I'm looking for more variety. The noodle bowls are awesome as well--#28 is nice because they'll chop up egg rolls and put them right in your bowl. Yum! As a plus, prices for any of the above top out at around $6.95.  The only thing I wouldn't recommend is getting one of Saigon's few fusion dishes--teriyaki chicken, for example. Stick to a strictly Vietnamese dish.  I would score a 5/5 for sure except a friend of mine did get sick there once a few years ago. I haven't had it happen in 10 years, so it may be a fluke. Still, I figure it's good to know!

I tried this place for the first time for Valentines Day. They were offering a fondue and wine special, but had the regular menu open as well. The special was great--for $49 a couple, we had a salad, cheese fondue, chocolate fondue, champagne, wine, and port.  Our waitress told us honestly that the portions weren't too sizeable, so we did also order an additional olive and cheese plate. (Honestly, we probably could have done without but wanted to splurge a bit since it was Valentine's day.)  The quality of the food was excellent! I really want to get the recipe to the chopped salad! The fondue was pretty tasty as well--not as good as Melting Pot, but much better for the price!  We liked the atmosphere even more than the food. Having to enter through the back (as you would for "any good speakeasy") added a fun and exclusive element.  Once inside, the tables are lit romantically by candelight. Around 9pm, towards the end of our meal, the jazz group began playing. They're definitely talented! Of course, if you want a more "quiet" atmosphere, I'd come before they start. :)  I'm excited to go back and try Kazimierz on a normal night!

This is some of the most authentic Italian pizza I've had in Phoenix The crust is baked to perfection, and the ingredients taste fresh and delicious.   I've been twice and enjoyed the romantic courtyard seating both times.  It's perfect for a date night, but also great for a dinner with friends and family.   As for portion size, the pizzas are big enough to split, especially if you get an appetizer. Save room for dessert as well! Last time I was looking for something smal and tried the cioccolatino--it was amazing!   The only thing I would hope for is a more expanisve menu--maybe offering the sandwiches for dinner as well. Cibo does mean "food" in Italian, after all. :) I'd love to see what their pasta would be like!

I've been a B of A customer since 2004, and I have no idea why I haven't left them years ago. The tellers for general banking needs are usually pretty polite, but anytime I have any other question or issue, I've always walked away more confused and frustrated than before. Every once in a while I'll experience great service, but it's very rare.  I just moved to this side of town, so I went to this location for the first time. I wanted to ask why I all of a sudden started being charged $6 a month for on-line banking while I was living abroad, hoping to get a refund or at least make sure I would stop getting charged.  The phony high school student working as a bank representative there did stop the charges, I'll give him credit for that. (This requires signing up for a new "free" banking system that requires you to use your B of A credit card once a month or face a $15 fee. And no, on-line purchases don't count. Go figure.)  But when I asked about refunds or at least finding out why my account changed without my knowledge, he said something about his computer being down and that he would call me within the week to let me know.  It's been a month now. Guess if I've heard from him.   I was also supposed to get new checks for getting the new account. Nope! Not yet, anyway!  Since I've been a B of A customer I've dealt with $1400 in bank fraud, (which they refunded and then suddenly took back out of my account when a representative made a typo on the amount,) have received checks with the wrong account number on them and then denied new checks when I didn't bring one in for proof, have been denied a bank letter required for a student visa, have been charged fees for not having money in an account I'd already closed, and countless other annoyances that are unacceptable for banking.  I was hoping this branch would be better! Disappointed as usual!   I know basically everyone is disatisfied with their bank in some way, but does anyone have any suggestions for when I finally decide to leave the dark side? Chase? Desert Schools?

La Bocca has been one of my favorite restaurants for a while now. I can't get enough of their sangria, appetizers, or mint ice cream. Yum!  While I wouldn't say the Italian food is all that "authentic," it's certainly delicious. The wood-fired pizza certainly rivals its more expensive competitors. Although I admit I'll sometimes just order the appetizer sampler and goat cheese salad, (and a pitcher of sangria,) and I'll be set for the evening.    The food is the main draw, but I have to say that the atmosphere is nice as well.  It's fairly trendy and the tables are candlelit--good for a date night or a classier alternative to a normal evening on Mill.   I would definitely recommend La Bocca! Have fun, and don't forget to save room for the ice cream!

Teharu is one of my favorite sushi bars in the valley...but to be honest, it's mostly because of the staff and atmosphere.  I've always received exceptional service here. And, let's face it, once you've gotten your food delivered on a conveyor belt, "normal" restaurants just aren't as fun anymore.  In terms of quality, I can't say Teharu is the best. Sometimes the sashimi tastes like it's been on the conveyor belt for a bit too long. But the variety is great, and for $1-$2 a plate, I can't complain!

I recently moved into the area, so my roommates and I decided to give this place a try. Everything minus the food was fine. I'm not much of a drinker, but the menu does include a lengthy and diverse beer selection.   The food is basically what you'd expect from a pub.  While the menu is a bit more extensive than similar places, the quality is about what you expect--mediocre at best.  But if you're not looking to eat, the atmosphere is nice for hanging out with friends, grabbing a beer, etc.  The servers are also friendly.  The day after going to the pub, though, I was very sick. I don't know if it's that my stomach can't handle a beer and hot chicken wings anymore, (must be getting old!) or if it was food poisoning. To play it safe, I'm definitely not going back for the food!

I worked at Urban Bean for a summer a few yeras ago and absolutely loved it.  One of the main appeals for me was how "green" the place was.  The to-go cups are biodegradable, the coffee is local and organic, the pastries are baked on site, the used coffee grounds are composted, and the extra pastries are donated.   The drinks are quite tasty as well. Although I haven't been in a while to try newer items, all of the classic stuff is delicious! I also recommend the cardamom cake if it's still offered--it tastes like a chai tea in cake form. Yum!

I absolutely love restaurants that are converted from old houses--in my experience they always have such a comfortable feel and the food always seems fresh and delicious.  The Main Ingredient definitely lived up to my expectations. The food is delicious, the ambiance is great, and the service is fast.  The patio is optimal for a date or hangout with friends. Since it was full, though, my date and I instead enjoyed relaxing couch seating inside. Also a good choice, although we felt a bit short since we were sitting across from a few hightop tables. :)  As this was my first visit, I've only tried a few things on the menu. But I can tell you that the artichoke dip is the best I've ever had. And the Jive Turkey sandwich is delicious. So is the lemonade--they offer free refills even though it's clearly homemade. Yum!    With so many interesting sandwich combinations, I'm excited to go back and sample more items. I'd also love to bring some vegetarian friends--they had quite a few tasty looking meat-free options.   My only complaint is that our waitress wasn't the friendliest. She wasn't rude, just seemed disinterested.  The rest of the staff, however, was really polite.  I could also forsee complaints arising from other patrons about the lack of parking available, but my date and I didn't mind walking off a few artichoke dip calories on the way back to the car.

My first Zoyo experience was amazing!  I had been out for a walk with friends and was wearing pajama pants since everything else was in the laundry. (Don't judge!)  I hadn't worn pajamas outside of the house in years, but figured no one would notice on an evening walk with a few close friends. But all of a sudden, they decided it was a great time for frozen yogurt!   I reluctantly went inside with my pajama pants on--did I mention they were bright blue and have monkey faces on them? But I noticed some young kids were also clad in silly pajamas, so I felt better.   When I went to pay for my yogurt, they only charged me $1. My friends had gotten the same amount of yogurt, but had paid three times as much. When I asked about it, the very friendly girl behind the counter informed me that Wednesday is "pajama night" and everyone wearing them gets a discount. Such an awesome coincidence!  There are other random discount days--Mondays, for instance, offers discounts for people who ride their bikes to Zoyo.  As for the yogurt, it was quite tasty! I love the pumpkin and red velvet flavors. They also offer a few non-dairy choices for lactose intolerant patrons. Most of the flavors are also fat-free, though I can't speak for the calories. :D  I would have given 5 stars--my only issue is that they closed an hour earlier than what was listed on the door. The really nice employee did let us hang out for a few extra minutes, though, which I appreicated as we had just sat down.  I'm definitely going back to Zoyo, and I no longer have qualms about wearing pajamas in public!

Tried this place for the first time the other day and had a great experience!  Right off the bat, I loved the decor! The menu is written in scrabble tiles and the space itself seems like a cross between an industrial space and a home library. Very cute!   Our barista was the owner. I forget her name, but she was very sweet and definitely knew how to make some delicious coffee!  I also appreciated that there were board games. Sometimes the best part of a day can be cozying up with friends to enjoy a mocha and some Trivial Pursuit!   My only complaint is that the restroom is around the corner--still indoors but part of a wide open room used for conferences. Wouldn't have been an issue, except I had to walk through a live conference to use the restroom, and I'm sure everyone in the audience heard me flush! Wah!  Otherwise, great visit! I'd love to go back!

Honestly my first visit to Seksun wasn't great. We were one of only two tables on a Saturday afternoon, but the service was slow and kind of strange--bringing one water refill when we were all empty, forgetting to put in an order, etc.  The sushi quality was mediocre and didn't taste all that fresh, as though the plates had been on the conveyor belt for quite some time.   It's about a half a block from my house, so I figured I'd continue to go occasionally but not make it a regular thing.  A few weeks ago, though, Seksun had a "free sushi night" where everything on the conveyor belt was on the house. (It definitely helped that our table was right next to the kitchen!) This time the sushi was fresh, the restaurant was fully staffed with friendly servers, and there was music playing. Since this time, I've had nothing but good experiences at Seksun. I think they've sorted out a lot of the issues many other reviewers and myself have mentioned, so my roommates and I have started eating there fairly often. We usually have a really awesome server, Frank, who is really friendly and usually pretty fast.  The food quality has definitely gotten better, especially if you order if from the menu instead of waiting for it on the conveyor belt. I also tried some of their umeshuu (plum wine) which is delicious! I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!
