Great haircuts for men, nice and friendly staff, and free cookies, what more could you ask for as a man in a salon?

Friendly people, good service. It's like they actually don't mind being at work. Unlike their 16th and Camelback location.

This is the BEST JMs I've been to. Not that other locations are bad, this one is just special. Everyone is really nice and friendly, you feel welcomed even when they're slammed. It's super clean. And let's not forget the best part; the sandwiches are delicious.

Today was my first and last time I will go into this branch. I work off tips and bought a large amount of ones today (175 so not too many). A teller named Dana, or Dena or whatever made it very clear she was not happy by making the comment "you're killing me smalls." and proceeded to count my money while huffing and puffing and not making eye contact. She was weird and the vibe was even weirder. Then she laughed at me both times a had to sign the receipt. She was extremely rude and I'd hate to deal with this person ever again. Go to 7th and Missouri they are leaps and bounds better there. This is the first time can honestly say I've been disappointed with Desert Schools. Congrats Dana, or whatever your name is.

I love the donuts here. I've only had the opportunity to try a few but what I had was delicious. The actual dough seems a little thicker than a traditional donut but still remains super soft. Yum.   When I was in everyone seemed to be quite happy with their experience which is nice to see considering they just opened two days prior. I'm sure as things progress things will only get better.   It's simple concept that Phoenix needed. It's a great time for local food business and always a great time for a donut... Or cinnamon roll... Or bear claw...
