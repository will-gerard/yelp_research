I agree with the other reviews - but for different reasons.   The management company (LPC / Lincoln Properties) "big corporation" approach trickles down and causes onsite management to behave like detached drones.  Tradition at Kierland is as beautiful as it looks. .    But it's not worth it!  Be very afraid:  Being  "managed" by a huge property company means that the on-site management can do or say as they please (or do nothing) and hide behind "the company" since there is no one you can get ahold of in the event of a problem or dispute.   The legal practices are questionable - like not showing you the entire lease until the day you move in - then you are surprised with some incredible terms:  Sure, you don't have to sign - but this is on the day you have abandoned your old place and arrive with a moving truck wanting the keys ...    Also - don't be fooled by the seemingly incredible discounts (if you sign a 13 or 24 month lease) - they are indeed too good to be true - and you will indeed regret being fooled.   I assume they can only get away with these practices due to the economy, perhaps with so many people trying to rent instead of own - but this is only grasping for a reason that the company and management behave so badly   Be aware of any company that seems to have as many lawyers than maintenance staff  (they lawyers respond faster than maintenance!)   Run - don't walk - away ... there are lots of other places  (just read the fine print to make sure they are not managed by Lincoln Properties/LPC or one of their affiliates).

Feeling a little silly raving about the food in a cafeteria for a furniture store - but it's true! - The food is very good, and the prices are probably cheaper than the average (subsidized) school lunch program.    Vanity stops me from going to Ikea just to have a great breakfast or lunch (for like $3-4) so sometimes we make up an excuse to browse at Ikea, just so we can combine it with lunch.    The food (in the cafe) is fresh cooked - like healthy grilled salmon, or from simple chicken dishes to swedish meatballs etc ... I hesitate to say "considering the price, the food is great"  because it makes it seem like it's about a cheap meal.  No ... Think of the food in the Ikea Cafeteria like their furniture:   Quality, stylish, sometimes exotic, always unique, at a great price  (and you have to assemble it yourself ; )

I'd like to say that the food was delicious except that our party of ten came to happy hour based on their website featuring a happy hour food menu. But when we got there after ordering drinks we were told that there was no happy hour menu, and that they were very sorry but the website is outdated.  The manager mentioned that they would be updating the website, after 2 years, to correct that they had happy hour specials... Meanwhile, our entire (now very hungry) party had to  to finish our drinks and find  a different restaurant .   Really,  the proper,  or classy move by the manager would have been to offer us the advertised happy hour menu and prices to make up for the mistake. So anyway I cannot comment on the food, but the one beer that I had was quite nice. So, there's that.

This was a rare find in Vegas.  A 5 star restaurant that was also quiet, elegant and reasonably priced.    My wife and I visit vegas quite often (5-10 times per year) mainly to enjoy the shows, restaurants and shopping. While there are many fine restaurants by some of the world's top chefs - few also offer this rare combination of a quiet dining experience (in Vegas!) plus world-class food, reasonably priced, AND with reasonable portions.    On a Saturday night, my wife and I went to look for a nice restaurant for a quiet dinner.  We saw a few small signs for Table-10, and found it in a rather discrete location  (away from the concentration of restaurants and shops, pleasantly perched on the second floor)).   When we got there, we were pleasantly surprised by several things:  1. there was no wait!  (for such a restaurant on a saturday night - this was astounding). 2. the restaurant was not crowded, and it was quiet enough for us to enjoy and have a conversation. 3. they had a $45 dinner special - 4 courses - with a variety of choices that were memorable and delicious.  One notable part of the meal experience ...  the portions.  One of my main complaints about Vegas restaurants (and about everything in vegas) is stressing Quantity over Quality.  Most restaurants cater to the tourist who wants value (quantity) for their money, and thus they pile on the portions to the point where you really cannot appreciate the meal.  Table-10 ... the portions were just perfect:  Satisfying but just enough to truly appreciate the cooking and to look forward to the next course.  Last - I will echo some of the other recommendations here - the Banana Cream "cake" - was amazing  (while I expected the entrees from an Emeril restaurant to be 5-star, the deserts were also memorable)-     Highly recommended!   But keep it a secret so we can get another quiet table next time!

Awful.  They look clean and competent - but every time I go there (and this is my last) - the car seems actually dirtier than when I arrived!  How is this possible?  Well, after they hand it back to me, there are crumbs etc on the seats (sloppy vacuuming) the  cupholders and console still has stains - I  mean OBVIOUS stuff.  There wasn't a visit where I had too send them back 2-3 times to re-vacuume  or re-wipe the inside.  I am no clean freak by any means,  This was just sloppy work,  Consistently.

Subway is great!....  just NOT THIS LOCATIION !! I have no idea why or how it came to be. - but everyone - from the manager on down is just, just ...  [searching through my thesaurus for the right word .. hmm .. hmm ] .. ah LAME.  here it is ... I order using the online system ALL the time - an average of 5-7 times per week at different subways all over the country (mostly in my area of Phoenix).  Everywhere else, no matter how busy - within 15-20 mins, I can pick up my order.  The employees know how to manage the incoming online order vs the walk-ins.  This store .. it is so bad it is comical.  Here is one example of the 4-5 times I tried with them: There is a Starbucks next door, so I was sitting there and decided to pace an order ... and I watched.  There was 1 customer in the store, maybe 2 ...  I waited 15-20 mins and came in to pick up my order.  He hadn't even started it!   And his excuse - "sorry there were customers in line".  (umm ... online orders don't state on the ticket "please make this sandwhich whenever the store is empty").  I had to wait 3-4 times longer for my order, thann if I stranded in line.  Other times the order was plain wrong (youusually don't find out until you are far away...)  I'd write more about how poor the management and service is, in this one store (all the rest are great!) .. I just don't want to waste more time on them ... but be warned.

Just a great experience all around.  Good food,  wine .... atmosphere and music pleasant ...not too loud or soft.  Very knowledgeable wait staff  ... about the wine and food. .. very attentive and friendly.   Layout of the tables vary  from dining to tall tables to sofas with outdoor fireplaces.  A classic black and white film always is projected on the back wall giving the place a very unique ambience.   Prices are reasonable with a good happy hour menu that is every day including Sunday.
