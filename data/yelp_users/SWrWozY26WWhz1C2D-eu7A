Geez. Not sure where to start.  The pizza was mediocre at best. And overpriced.  Then to sit there and watch/listen to the staff berate some customers in front of everyone.   There are many food options around the Westgate area. This would be the last one I would recommend to anyone.

Love love love this place.  Excellent food every time. And the service is always great.  I highly recommend the schwarma, either chicken or steak, and the Greek fries.  I crave Pita Kitchen often and it never disappoints.

I love Chipotle. The staff is always so friendly and I always know what I'm getting. The prices are right and the food is healthy. My kids love it too.  If I'm at Westgate, Chipotle is always an option.
