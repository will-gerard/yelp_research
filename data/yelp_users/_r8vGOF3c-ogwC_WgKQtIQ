I was a bit disappointed by this little place, as I've heard so many good things. I always order the same dish at every Thai restaurant (pad Thai) so it gives me a good basis for comparison.  The pad Thai here was a bit soupy, and was severely lacking in veggies. It didn't come with tofu either, which was too bad (all of the other vegetarian dishes did, however). It seemed to be made up of sauce and bean sprouts, with a few noodles thrown in.   I wouldn't rush out to this place. There are plenty of other phenomenal Thai joints around.

I hadn't been to Buca Di Beppo in a few years and I won't be going back for at least a few more (until the memories of my experience fade, at least).   First of all, it's incredibly expensive. I understand it's meant to be served family style, but my fiancee and I ordered a single dish, and had a coupon for another free one, a small order of garlic bread and two waters. Our bill: $32 - for ONE dish and garlic bread! It's ridiculous!  Second, the service was terrible. 30 minutes after we were seated, we finally had the chance to order. This isn't to say the waitress didn't come to the table, she did. It's just that when she did, she was in such a hurry that all we could eek out before she was rushing away was that we wanted two waters. We were there for an hour and a half for spagetti. I will just make this at home from now on.  Third, the way the restaurant is laid out, it's VERY loud. There was a party of about 10 people next to us, and my fiancee and I couldn't even hear each other talk. So we say in silence. Now, this is not the restaurants fault, but these people were OBNOXIOUS. The management should have said something.   And finally, the food is terrible. It reminded me of food made at summer camp - you know what I'm talking about - the mass produced kind with standard pasta and sauce. My fiancee also noted that his chicken parmigiana was terrible and that it's better at Olive Garden. A restaurant I will be sticking with from here on out :)

After writing this post, I was contacted by the owner and reimbursed for their error in charging me twice. It was handled professionally and I'm excited to use the money I was given back for more tattoos!

I've been to the one at Desert Ridge many times, but sadly, it has closed so I went to this location instead. The menu is pretty extensive but the food itself was subpar. The noodles were too rubbery and the flavors were pretty standard. I ordered a saketini which I've had many places and this was the worst! It was all vodka, and no sake. Waste of money.   They also had a young girl playing the piano there...which was....out of place. It made it so the restaurant was so loud that I couldn't even speak to the person next to me.   Definitely won't be going back here soon.

I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed.   First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble?   Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it!   Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go.

This place is very true to its name-very retro, very metro. The prices were a bit high but all of their items are truly unique. FLW pieces, Eames airport benches, etc. Great spot for someone looking for a specific designer who has some spare cash they need to burn.   The owners were super friendly and the location was super cute! It's a little hard to find but once you do, it's a treat. The only reason I'm not giving them more stars is the prices are more than I can afford.

Best. subs. ever. Didn't receive 5 stars because their hours are terrible! Only open until 8 and 6:30 whenever school isn't in session is ridiculous. There are more than just students living in Tempe!

YUM!!!!!  This is one of my favorite Thai places - especially at lunch! My whole company (4 people) can eat here for like $30!   The pad Thai lunch special is insanely tasty and leaves me full for the rest of my work day. If you like Thai, give this little place a go!

Very good, authentic Mediterranean fare. They also have great lunch specials - entire vegetarian platter (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas) for $7.99, can't beat that! I also tried a few of their french fries and they were delicious!  Otherwise, it was a bit slow on the service but a nice place to eat. I will definitely go back here again!

This is the definition of a hidden gem! Nestled in a strip mall, this cute little place will leave you delighted and stuffed!   The extensive menu offers heaping portions and endless options. I've had their eggplant entree, greek salad, artichoke dip, pizza, etc. and I have no complaints about a single one of them! Everything is fantastic!   I even took my incredibly picky parents to this place and they've been back 4 or 5 times...now that's truly telling of the place.

Nothing great about this place. They could replace the sign with Subway and I would never know...except that there would be fewer options to top my sub with. They coined the phrase "Mike's Way" in an effort to allow you to order your sandwich in some special and tasty way. In reality, it means lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar...wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. As a vegetarian, this is one of my least favorite sub places since there are not too many toppings for those of us avoiding the meat selections.  I've only been here once and will not be going back.

I recently attended a wedding reception held at this venue and was thoroughly disappointed. What's too bad for them is that I am currently searching for a venue for my own wedding and will not be considering nor recommending this location to anyone I know.  First and foremost, the organization was poor. No one had any clue where to go, there was one tiny little sign that said which wedding reception you were standing in the middle of (yes, they held more than 1 which got crowded and confusing). The biggest disappointment was in the food. The cuisine was prepared and apparently only 2 vegetarian requests were put in, and we needed a 3rd. The hotel would not accommodate this request and I went hungry. What was funny about that was when I saw a vegetarian plate delivered, it was literally a plate of steamed vegetables. They couldn't throw together some extra veggies on a plate? They couldn't walk over to the restaurant located in the same hotel to get SOMETHING for me to eat? Nope. I went unfed.   Other than that, the staff was rude, the venue was stale looking and the decorations were bland. I wouldn't even consider this location for your wedding or any event you may want to hold here.

This place is pretty cute, good happy hour prices (4-7, 9-close), and tasty food. I had never had vietnamese before, and I was pleasantly surprised. The wait staff is a bit annoying (they kept coming to the table every 2-3 minutes or so), but other than that, definitely a good find.  The only weird thing is if you sit in the back area of the restaurant on the right, you look into a grocery store with bright lights and shoppers...it's a bit odd for a nicely appointed little restaurant.

After giving this place a few more chances, I've come to discover their yellow curry to be PHENOMENAL! They also have a special pumpkin curry sometimes which is amazing as well. Definitely worth the trip for the curry alone. YUM.

I stumbled across this place today and was glad I did. Unlike other antique malls, this one was spacious and had AMAZING items to be found.   It's not one of the most glamorous buildings in the area, but it's definitely worth a look. Prices vary and they truly have some unique and EXTREMELY vintage items in there (picked up a typewriter that's 90 years old!)

I hesitate to write a review because I want this gym all to myself :-p  The owners, Robert and Vicki, are super friendly and informative and still manage to teach me something new each session (I've been working out for a while now, so I was sure I knew everything. NOT!).   They do a great job with offering a well-rounded health and nutrition plan to get results fast, and it's the good kind of results-- less body fat and more lean muscle, not just numbers on a scale.   I'd definitely recommend this gym to anyone struggling with motivation and struggling to get their body where they'd like. It's tough, but it's been worth it!

My mother had used this company to do some work in her kitchen and recommended I use them to install some security doors on my house. They were easy to communicate with (email, text, phone), showed up on time, were reasonably priced, and even swept up my car port and put away my trash can when they were done. Left my house in pristine order and did everything wonderfully!   Their policy is to never let anyone have keys to your home besides them, which also means they are there at all times to supervise the labor. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that fact. No more lock boxes!!  I've had some terrible experiences with contractors in the past and I will definitely be calling these ladies again (oh, it's owned and operated by two women... how cool it that?!)

The ambiance at this place can't be beat! Live music on most nights, great wine and drink menu, and plenty of food options. The food is great, the decor is fantastic and every experience I have with this place has been phenomenal!   I highly recommend it for dates/intimate evenings.

I've used Planet Hugger both for regular service as well as a "move-in" service to clean a vacant home before we moved into and they did an incredible job. My husband said they were even on their hands and knees using a razor blades to remove stuck on junk on our tile floors. (Gross to admit but we have a baby, is that a good enough excuse?)  Everything is sparkling when they leave, very pleasant to work with and all-natural cleaning products are required for a house with pets and a baby. I can't imagine using anyone else! (They even folded the toilet paper rolls the cute way that hotels do, nice touch!)

Great, great location but still working out the kinks.   As with any new restaurant, my experience was that of an establishment still trying to establish itself. Besides the longer-than-expected wait times for food and food items never arriving, what did end up in front of me was UN-BELIEVABLE!   I'm a vegetarian with a long history of being underwhelmed by veggie sandwiches. In fact, you'll rarely catch me ordering one because of the blandness that so often accompanies the traditional "salad-on-a-sandwich" that is usually served to me. I decided to go against my gut and order the veggie sandwich and was so happy I did. What ended up in my belly was the most flavorful, rich sandwich I've ever tasted. It was amazing that they could cram so much flavor into this thing. It was truly amazing.   Along with my sandwich I also ordered their Cactus Cooler adult beverage. Absolut Pears, ginger syrup and muddled serrano peppers... yes, peppers! Let me just say, that drink burned so good.   All in all I will definitely be back!
