Based on Yelp reviews, we dined at this restaurant recently on a double date. The building itself is adorable. Maybe used to be an old house? It's cozy and you feel like you will be served some home cookin' with a twist. Our appetizer of spinach artichoke dip was delicious but the meal declined after the beginning. My husband and I both ordered the chile relleno. The description looked fantastic but the polenta was bland and the chile itself (for not being heavily fried) was very greasy and left me wanting. One of our friends ordered the crab cakes which he described as fine.   Toward the end of our meal, a gnat was discovered floating in a Manhattan at our table. Our server was notified, she took the drink away after asking if our friend wanted a replacement (he declined) and we waited for our check. The drink was still included on the check and the waitress seemed a bit surprised when he asked for it to be removed.   I think the reason I was so disheartened about this experience was we still ended up paying about $70 for our meal (just for myself and my hubs.) Unfortunately, Coronado is not worth the food, price or overall experience.

I appreciate that this is a historic theater in Phoenix. However, it needs some serious attention. The rows are dreadfully close together -- I'm 5'9 and my knees were touching the seat in front of me the entire show. The bathrooms and concession stands are thoroughly outdated. The real kicker was parking. After seeing Aziz Ansari, we sat in the parking lot for 45 minutes without moving an inch. For a theater that holds only 2,600, I don't understand how it was so chaotic.   Oofta. Will not return unless they host a must-see act.

When I found out I was having a baby, one of my top priorities was finding suitable childcare. I knew I would be going back to work and wanted to have arrangements made well in advance. Who would've thought quality daycare comes with applications and long waitlists?  5 months before I was due, I started researching and scheduling tours. I had heard nothing but stellar things about Montessori. That combined with Villa's infant room, almost unheard of at these schools, was an immediate draw for me.  I don't want to bore you with the details but after several postponements of our tour, unresponsiveness from staff members, and clear internal miscommunications, we never even got to see the facility. I had to go out of my way to try and establish a relationship. After several attempts, I wrote an email advising we would not be pursuing childcare at their facility. The director went above and beyond to contact me and asked if we could set up a phone call. I agreed but did not receive a call at the scheduled time -- icing on the cake.   I experienced a huge lack of professionalism with Villa that I'm not willing to risk translating into something more serious in care of my LO.

Parking is a hot mess and I really try to avoid this area altogether over the weekends. Overall, I really like this TJ's. They seem to have the same staff working there longterm (win) and they're always super friendly. This store stays well-stocked and I'm almost always able to find exactly what I need.

This location is not as stellar as others. They usually have a bit of a wait and the regular employees do not seem thrilled to be there. The food is fine but the customer service alone makes it a chore to stop by.

Easily the best dry cleaner in Phoenix. This place is top notch. Be prepared to pay more than a $2/shirt joint but it's well worth the additional cost. My clothes are always returned good as new and never damaged. Customer service is great, the owner and employees really know their industry. They also contract out with a seamstress to do minor and affordable repairs. Evening/weekend drop off with next day pickup. Keep up the good work, Elite. Yelpers love you and so do I.

Dr. Bracken is superb. He truly has a gift with animals. When we switched vets, I was a nervous wreck. Don't judge me for being a crazy pet owner -- nothing's too good for my furry babes. Dr. Bracken spends a lot of time with our animals and is also great in giving treatment options. He's so nice and friendly.   I like the laid back environment, ease of appointment scheduling, and excellent location in Arcadia. This practice is also more affordable than others we've frequented. Glad we found this veterinary gem!

I think as far as airports go, Sky Harbor is pretty great. As other Yelpers have stated, for such a large airport the security check goes relatively quickly. Terminal 4 is the biggest/best with restaurants, shops, etc but the other terminals are fine as well. Make sure if you're getting dropped off/parking a car that you're at the correct terminal. They're working on a tram but for now you either have a hefty walk or have to catch a shuttle to get to another terminal. Plan ahead, know where you're going and you'll be just fine. Free wi-fi for your layover pleasure and an overall well kept building makes Sky Harbor a great departure point from Phoenix...c'mon, you wouldn't want to be here when it's 115 degrees either.

This girl loves Kona's happy hour! They have great deals on rolls and the drinks are very affordable. I appreciate that they have many options for vegetarians, including avocado egg rolls which I could eat all day if allowed to do so. The wait staff is efficient and friendly. This particular location is at the food court end of the mall and is a short stroll from the movie theater and mall shops close by.    I probably would recommend a local sushi joint if you're going for a regular/later meal. Your money will go further at a smaller restaurant. However, few happy hours will ever be able to match my love for an atlantic roll and sake bomber after a long day at the office.

Some people go to car dealerships to gawk at new vehicles. Others window shop at their favorite department store. I myself prefer to frequent Williams Sonoma and try my best to keep from drooling all over the Le Creuset line. If I'm feeling really dangerous, I will hit this place up during one of their sales. This store has great customer service and the staff is very knowledgeable about the products they sell. With kitchenware, you get what you pay for. Believe me when I say you will not regret your decision to spend a bit more money on a much better product. If I could give this store any negative feedback it would be that is is highly addictive. Warning--once you enter, you are sure to return :)

We have eaten a Mikado a few times now for lunch and have been impressed each and every time. They have a very large sushi menu as well as regular menu items. Their lunch specials are pretty good although there are no veggie options on there so it doesn't usually help me out. However, I have had the veggie tempura roll, avocado roll and shitake mushroom roll. All have been delicious and I will definitely be a repeat customer.

I really do enjoy this location and miss having it closer to our home. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The layout is easy to navigate and I believe their prices are generally lower than other grocery chains in the area. It is very clean, has a great variety of products and rewards you for using your VIP card (10 cents of per gallon of gas can be appreciated!)

This is a very nice park. We have started bringing our dog here for nightly walks and he loves it. There's plenty of space for exercise but it's also a great spot for lounging around in the cool fall weather. Looking forward to utilizing this park that is so close to home for us!

As far as PetSmart stores go, this one is pretty good. The customer service is great, the store is clean and everything is easy to find. This particular location hosts an animal rescue (called Paw Placement) which as an animal lover, is refreshing to see. North Scottsdale is a bit of a drive for me but if I am in the area and need to go to a PetSmart, I will head to this store.

Dr. Longwill and his staff are top notch. I have never felt more comfortable at a dentist's office than I do here. They are very friendly and are sure to explain everything thoroughly. I live about 45 minutes from the office and I don't mind the drive, they are worth it! Sarah at the front desk always brightens my day and that is saying something when one finds themselves at a dentist's office!

We went to Four Peaks for a late dinner with friends. We are all big fans of their brews so that was the main appeal. They didn't have a ton of vegetarian options but my husband and I split the portabella veggie beer bread. I wasn't super impressed but again, we were primarily there for the beer. Nothing goes down like a peach ale on a hot Arizona night :)

We brought a stray kitten here to get her all fixed up so she could be adopted. She received her spay, testing and all shots for $120...that is a steal. I was surprised at how friendly the staff was and they made sure to answer any questions I had. Maeby (the kitten) has healed up well and is in the clear to be adopted. It is a bit drab and even a little depressing but their money goes to providing affordable pet care, not decorating. I will continue to bring my pets to their normal vet but if you're in a pinch and wanting to save a lot of money on these necessary vet trips, this is the place to go.

I'm not typically in this area but found myself in south Tempe after a morning appointment. With about 10 people ahead of me in line, I knew I had hit rush hour and figured I would be waiting quite a while. To my delight, I didn't wait in line more than a couple of minutes, was helped with a smile and my drinks were out within another 5 minutes. Wish I lived closer to this location!

This is the only salon I will go to in the valley for waxing. I found JFY about 2 years ago and have been a fan ever since. I always make sure to see Heather (although I'm sure all the girls are great.) She is a fantastic esthetician and I am always so impressed with her work. I've never had a brow wax like the ones I get from her! The braz you can get here is amazing as well, totally worth it. They explain everything really well and make sure that you are comfortable. They pride themselves on a "no double dipping" rule and that is something I appreciate. The customer service is fantastic. Loretta, the owner, is always quick to get me on the schedule as I am typically guilty of needing a last minute appointment. I would highly recommend JFY and plan to be a loyal customer for a long time!

Seriously, this 'sno-cone' is a cut above the rest. I could almost guarantee you've never had one like this. I highly recommend the strawberry colada w/ tropical creme, of course! It's cheap and you get a heaping amount of sugary sweet goodness in a styrofoam cup, sure to cool you down during the hot AZ summers. I'm not sure about the other locations but this one stopped accepting debit/credit cards. I get that small businesses can take a hit with bank fees but really...no one carries cash anymore and I'm not going to write a check to get my dessert. If you do have cash on you, swing by the drive-thru and dive in. You won't regret it.

We just saw The Decemberists here and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. Aside from the fact that this is my favorite band, the venue itself was fantastic. Not too big, not too small and great customer service.The acoustics were phenomenal. It is easy to find and parking is free if you find a spot in one of the nearby neighborhoods. Here's to hoping that another great band will soon perform here!

Suzanne's has a great selection of dresses. I knew when we were married in April 2009 that I wanted a Maggie Soterro gown so choosing this boutique was a no brainer. In all fairness, my dress was perfect. Suzanne herself did the alterations and it was perfection. Unfortunately, our patronage did not stop with my gown and thus the slippery slope began.  My mother also purchased her dress from Suzanne's and while it was nice, it was discovered on the day of the wedding that an entire seam had be left open during alterations. Strike one. My groom, his groomsmen, ushers, and fathers all rented their tuxedos from here as well. I am not exaggerating when I say there was something wrong with every single (count it, 7!) tuxedo. Holes in the shirts, lipstick on the collars, ivory and white shirts mixed together, wrong sizes, the list goes on and on. The best part of it all was my husband's shoe breaking during pre-ceremony pictures. He switched shoes with his best man so as to stay on solid ground during our wedding :) Coming in a close second was my father-in-law being peed on by one of the owner's dogs (in a bridal shop?!) when he went to go pick up his tux. A BIG strike two.  The icing on the cake was while my husband and I were on our honeymoon. Suzanne called my mother to tell her all of the tuxedos had not been returned (untrue.) While my mom calmly explained everything that had gone wrong, Suzanne yelled at her and accused my husband of doing something to break the shoe, that I was ungrateful, etc...I really didn't consider myself to be a bridezilla, found the comments to be totally unfounded and offensive toward myself, my husband and my mom. Oh, and the phone call was ended in a lovely professional way-she hung up on my mom after laying into her. Strike three, you're out.  I know weddings don't go perfectly. After it was said and done the issues with the tuxedos were a joke in a our family. However, the treatment we received from Suzanne (the owner) was unprofessional, rude and childish. I can't recommend this shop to anyone. Spend a little more money and go somewhere that has more to offer than just selection.

Since moving to Arizona, I have found it difficult to find "mom and pop" shops in the East Valley. Imagine my delight when a coworker directed me to The Bread Basket. This is a quaint, privately owned bakery that has excellent customer service and delivers a fantastic product. My husband and I chose this bakery to make our wedding cake and we were not disappointed. We ordered a three tier square cake. It was a marble cake with fresh raspberry filling...no fruit preserves allowed. It was delicious and beautiful, exactly what we had wanted. One of the owners, Brenda, delivered the cake to our venue herself. Since then, we order a miniature version of our cake on every anniversary and continue to enjoy the baking bonanza at The Bread Basket.

Target stores seem to be very similar in layout, product placement and obviously, pricing--so the differences between them do not usually stand out to me. This store is in a great location. For the most part, the staff seems helpful although the general attitude seems to have diminished in recent years. Their lane management also does not seem to be on par with what it used to be as there is usually a wait. However, overall I like this store. I can say with confidence that I will seek out a Target before succumbing to the dark side of Wal-Mart.

This is a great restaurant with fantastic breakfast cuisine. My only complaint was the wait but that is to be expected on a weekend. Once we were seated, our server was prompt and the food was brought out very quickly. We had the pancakes and wild mushroom omelette (with avocado!) It was delicious, we will definitely return to The Breakfast Club!

So...in the future, I'm hoping to be able to write a stellar review for this restaurant but that will have to wait. For now, I have to be a bit critical and somewhat bitter due to the fact we didn't even get to eat our Saturday breakfast here. We put our name in to get a table and were told it would be about a 20 minute wait--no problem. We strolled around Civic Center Plaza for a bit and then went back to snag our table. We waited for about 15 minutes before we were helped at all and when our server did come she took our drink orders, brought our beverages and then moved on for another 15 minutes. She came back and apologetically told us that the kitchen was running about 40 minutes late. We had our puppy with us (this place is dog friendly on the patio which is sweet) and we just couldn't justify staying that long. She comped my delicious orange juice which was very kind of her and we promised we would be back. Bummer. I guess the moral of the story is this may not be the place for you if you're in a hurry or have a hyperactive puppy in your midst. Hopefully I'll have better things to say next time around!

I am happy to report that I was able to eat breakfast here recently and it was a great experience. Our server was great and compared to other reviews, I felt the service was fairly quick. We were initially told that there was a ten minute wait and ended up waiting for about 25-30 minutes...certainly not a deal breaker.   Our food was wonderful. We split an order of french toast and the garlic mushroom scramble. Both were delicious but I could go on and on about the scramble...the sauce on it was savory, rich and the perfect topping for eggs. My orange juice was not that great this time--it was pretty sour but that could be a fluke because the last time we were here my OJ was superb and definitely worth the money.   As I said before, a big draw to this restaurant for us is the fact that they are dog friendly. Even on a chilly morning, the patio (equipped with heat lamps) makes for a fun family outing with our pooch.

After 5 years of living/working a stone's throw from Cowboy, I finally pulled the trigger and ate lunch here with co-workers. First impression was subpar. I called to make a reservation for 7 people at 12pm on a Wednesday. I was a bit surprised that the host required a credit card to hold our table. Really? For lunch?  When we arrived, we were seated promptly but it took 20 minutes to have waters brought to the table. It took another 30 minutes for our food to be served. I had the vegetarian chopped salad which was delicious. It wasn't good enough to outweigh the bad service paired with high prices. Unfortunately, this place is a little pretentious for my liking. Too bad!

It's a little scary when you've reached the point with your vehicle that you can't justify taking it to the dealership anymore for service. I love my Honda dealership but couldn't justify driving 30 miles and spending exponentially more money there than a normal shop.   A family referral brought me to the door of Marshall's and I have had two good experiences so far. Both times I brought my car here were normal maintenance appointments so I can't speak to huge repairs or their costs. I can tell you that both times, my oil changes were done within a couple of hours, the final price was reasonable and customer service is overall pretty good. I've never felt I was being taken advantage of or that my patronage hasn't been valued. Car talk can be a daunting task for a this lady and I'm glad to have found this little safe and reliable gem in Scottsdale.

We recently attended the St. Francis Festival here and had our dog blessed. While we didn't get to see the inside of the center, it seemed to be a lovely location and the grounds were certainly clean and well kept. This was a great event with animal adoptions and dogs everywhere! Lots of fun for our dog (and us) and we will certainly return next year.

In my adult years, I've become a tried-and-true doctor snob. I don't like waiting for extended periods of time. I hate calling to schedule an appointment when I'm sick and being told I can't be seen for two weeks. I loathe feeling like my doctor doesn't care about me. Dr. Gibson and staff might be psychic because they surpassed all of my expectations from start to finish.  I only sat in the waiting room for 5 minutes before I was called back. My nurse, Pam, was legit. So sweet, so friendly, and made sure I was comfortable. Dr. Gibson was just lovely. She spent 20 minutes in my room, actively listening and getting to know me. She assured me that she's set up her office to accommodate same-day appointments in urgent cases - love! They also do lab work in house. I'm so happy and relieved to finally have found a PCP who cares about me as a patient.  Five star doctor, five star office, five star experience.

So...dang...good. The Humbolt on garlic herb is ahhhhhmazing (make sure you get a side of ranch) and it goes down well with a tall cup of Kool-Aid. Lunch time can be crazy and if you go in the afternoon, prepare for a lengthy wait. Not cheap but not expensive and definitely the quintessential 'munchies' food.

This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesn't happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes.   We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.  This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.

I love Green. My husband and I have only been vegetarians for about 9 months and we were pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant a few months ago. We have tried many of the dishes--so far my favorite is the Green burger. The food is tasty, the atmosphere is laid back and customer service is usually pretty good. My favorite part about eating at Green is dessert...Betterfingers Tsoynamis are a must for me. It is delicious and satisfying! Really the only reason I can't get myself to give 5 stars is because of their prices...they are a little high for my taste but is not enough to deter me from returning!

Like many before me, I am trying to be sure to review only the venue itself. I appreciate Gammage for what it brings to the Valley. The arts don't have a huge presence here but this theater brings a little bit of Broadway to the dry, Arizona desert. They typically line up seasons that have something for everybody which makes an evening show now and then almost impossible to resist.   The building itself is older and does not have an elevator--meaning that anyone who has a physical disability which renders them unable to climb stairs, must buy tickets on the orchestra level. Out of the many shows I have attended here, there have been frequent issues with the sound system...disappointing when you are sitting further than 5 rows from the stage.   However, being that this is the only stage in AZ that houses big traveling productions, I can't complain too much and will continue to be a patron here. Looking forward to the rest of this season!

One thing that is very difficult to find is a Mexican restaurant that does not cook their beans with lard. La Fonda's beans are veggie which is great because they are delicious. Great customer service, prices are ok and delicious food. I usually get the bean and cheese burrito-fundido style. Now that I'm moving closer to this area I will be eating here much more often!

The produce is yummy and their frozen food choices are creative, easy and tasty. This store is in a great location and I love shopping here!

Everything about TeePee is average. The food is really heavy and usually loaded up with grease. Only a few options for vegetarians (beans are safe, rice is not) and I'm just not crazy about the fare offered. I know it's historic, George W. ate here, etc. Lack of quality outweighs tenure to me.

Love it. Beautiful atmosphere, great customer service and fresh food. A little pricey but worth it for a fun evening out. My only complaint is that they are closed both Sundays and Mondays--seems a little excessive but that's just me. I highly recommend the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. To all my veggies out there, never fear! Their beans are safe for us :) For many years we have been and will continue to be frequent customers.

So happy we live so close to Chelsea's Kitchen! This place is great. Fresh food, reasonable prices and a nice ambiance. Don't miss the white sangria, it is refreshing and wonderful to share. The service is usually good although the last time we visited, the hostess seemed quite bothered to help us. The only real complaint I have is that they only take reservations for parties of 18 or more. 18?! Really? Excessive. Without a reservation on a Saturday night, you will easily wait for over an hour. The patio is fabulous and this is a great brunch/lunch/dinner spot in Phoenix.

IKEA is a monster. Really. You could easily spend the majority of a day walking around aimlessly and taking in the scenery. Even when I'm not in the market for any big ticket items, I enjoy seeing the rooms they have set up to showcase their products. It never fails that I'm walking out of there with a least one or two gadgets. The overall concept of the store is great. While it may not be the highest quality of furniture, it does its job well and certainly can be used in most decorating styles. Some items are moderately priced. Others (ie; lounge chairs) seem overpriced to me. But that's the beauty of IKEA--you can pick and choose. I don't think there is another store on this planet that i say, "Wouldn't this look great?" more than I do in IKEA. Wild horses couldn't drag me away :)

We have started bringing our dog here almost daily and have had nothing but good experiences so far. The grounds themselves are very well kept. There is a 'passive' dog area and an 'active' area. Translation--little dog and big dog sections. There are doggie level drinking fountains (some are at people level too!), agility obstacles and shaded areas speckling each enclosed park. The people that bring their dogs here seem to overall be very responsible and aware of what is going on. We haven't had any problems and look forward to returning...nothing wears our pup out like a trip to doggie Disneyland!

Regular movie theaters have been ruined for me. Esplanade is fantastic and while it's a bit of a drive for us, it is a a theater  I will gladly put miles on my car for. Between the two types of theaters, I would recommend the Cinema Suites. These theaters are smaller (less people to annoy you,) no kids allowed,  the cushy seats recline, no one can kick your chair (you're in your own partitioned row,) and best of all you have your very own server in your very own reserved seat.  It's in a great part of Phoenix, the Biltmore area has plenty of options should you choose to have dinner outside of the the theater. Make sure if you park in the garage you have the front desk validate your ticket. Also, reserve tickets online before you head out the door. The theaters are small and sell out very quickly. Looking forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises midnight premier this week and NOT have to wait in line! God bless reserved seating.

The Cottage was the florist for our April 2009 wedding. They were fantastic. Many who have planned or are planning a wedding know what a stressful task it is to find each individual vendor. The florists we met with prior to contacting The Cottage were well out of our price range. Imagine my relief when I found this tucked away, adorable cottage in Queen Creek that also happened to be a florist. The prices were very reasonable, the girls spent a good amount of time with me discussing what I really wanted and best of all, the end result was stunning. Our flowers were delivered on time to our venue and the calla lilies which were the center of every arrangement were breathtaking. As a bride, I appreciated the reasonable pricing, friendliness of the staff and most of all the outstanding finished product. I would highly recommend this florist for weddings!

All pets in our family are patients at McClintock Animal Care Center. The staff is kind, caring and so helpful. The doctors are amazing and really take their time with your pet. Our dog has had constant health issues over the last 4 years --Dr. D and Dr. W have gone above and beyond to treat her. We LOVE this vet's office and trust no one else with our feline and canine family members :)

My husband and I lived here from 2009-2010 so this may be a little dated. However, I can say with confidence that during this time period,  this was a very nice apartment complex and we enjoyed living here.  Rent was very reasonable for such a nice area (hop, skip and a jump from Ocotillo.) Our apartment itself was lovely with upgraded appliances and a great kitchen. The two bedroom we were in was spacious, had great natural lighting and was overall very nice. I wasn't a huge fan of their parking policy. We had one covered space and the other was a first come first serve. We didn't take advantage of the amenities as often as we should have but when we did they were a reminder of the spoils of apartment living. San Palacio has a great pool with cabanas and tons of space in the immediate area. I enjoyed our time at this apartment complex and would recommend it to anyone looking for an apartment in Chandler.

From the first time we visited, I have been impressed with this restaurant. Pho places are not common in our neck of the woods and I am very happy we have found one that serves great food and provides good service.  While pho itself usually has beef broth in it, the owner has been happy to make ours "veggie"--vegetable broth, noodles, herbs and vegetables. Delicious! Soup does the body (and soul) good and it is definite comfort food for me. The veggie spring rolls are also very good.   We've never had bad service here and until something drastic changes, we will be frequent customers at this little strip mall joint.

Clearance heaven. I've found some steals at this location. I'm not usually one to spend a large amount of money on shoes so I scope out the sale racks before I'll head into the full priced shoes. I'm rarely disappointed in their selection and find the customer service to be quite good.  Sign up for their mailing list and you will get coupons that will help ease the pain your wallet feels upon checkout.

I love Costa Vida. Their salads are delicious, it must be the fresh tortillas that are layered on the bottom.Customer service is great and the food is consistently good. My only issue with this restaurant is when you are nickel and dimed for things like sour cream, extra dressing, etc...I'm not a fan of that. But the pros outweigh the cons and I will continue to eat here.

Ah Sprinkles. I curse you for coming into my life. So does my scale. This place is indulgent, delicious and decadent. Simultaneously, it is fun, fresh and makes you feel like a kid (what kid doesn't love a cupcake?) The customer service here is obviously a top priority to the company as it is always pristine. It is a little pricey but oh-so worth it. I bounce between the chocolate marshmallow cupcake and the vegan red velvet--you would never guess there is no dairy or eggs in these! The day we live in a city that doesn't have a Sprinkles is the day I will cry myself to sleep.

Times have changed. Unfortunately, I am no longer a Sun Devil. I am not in between classes and certainly don't look the age of a college student. Therefore, I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb at this particular location. Do I care? Nope. In-N-Out is good no matter what college campus it is on :) As with most of their locations, GREAT customer service and a fantastic product. Nothing like a grilled cheese (animal style) to make you feel a bit better about life.

The breakfast burritos here are amazing. I always get the #12 with potatoes. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because they charge you extra to substitute things, charge for extra salsa, etc...otherwise, my co-workers and I love this restaurant.

Dog Days has quickly become our dog's home away from home. He LOVES it there. Sure, I was a frantic, overprotective dog mom the first time we dropped him off but my fears were quickly dissolved when I realized the quality of this facility.  The day care section is divided into a 'big dog' and 'little dog' section. The dogs are closely watched at every moment to ensure safety for all. The employees are very attentive and know everyone's names by heart (it's the little things, after all.) Also, this place is crate free, meaning you don't have to pay extra for your dog to play with others all day. They are only crated if being fed a meal or if they are being boarded overnight.   Megan, the owner, is great and very reassuring even to neurotic pet owners like myself. The first time we boarded Dexter for a long weekend, we called twice a day to check on him. She was kind and patient, explaining to us during each call that he was having the time of his life.   Dexter's visits are now a weekly occurrence and one I know he looks forward to. These trips are mutually beneficial as he not only has fun but is completely exhausted afterwards, giving his parents a much needed night off. Love Dog Days and plan to be a long and loyal customer!

Delicious, unique and a bit of a hidden gem in Scottsdale. We have had a quick breakfast here a few times now and it is great. The chocolate croissants are flaky and buttery, basically melting in your mouth. The crepes are cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. The customer service is very good. The menu doesn't seem to have many vegetarian options for dinner but we look forward to enjoying lunch here soon as they have many items we would be interesting in trying. Head over to Scratch and say Bon Jour to some tasty French cuisine!

Pitta Souvli is without a doubt my favorite Greek restaurant in the Valley. It is locally owned, has fantastic customer service and the food is amazing. I am a vegetarian and this place always has delicious options for me. However, pre-vegetarian days were filled with their tuna salad which is out of this world :) Don't miss out on an order of the greek fries when you visit!

I. Love. Sprouts. This store is truly fantastic. Unfortunately, there is not one close to our house so I do not frequent them as much as I would like to. However, this location is near my work and I will sometimes pop over there on my lunch to do my grocery shopping.  I think stores like these have a reputation for being much more expensive than a typical grocery store. My experience has proved otherwise. Granted, we do not eat meat so I am not sure what the comparative prices for those products would be. However, the food we do buy--vegetables, fruit, dairy products, etc--is very affordable. They may be a bit more than what you would spend at Fry's but the quality is certainly a cut above.

There are not many fabric stores in the area anymore so it is nice that this one is so close. I have been to this location a couple of times recently to buy fabric for chairs that I have been redoing. They had a great selection of what I needed. I would only go to this store when they are having a big sale or you have a coupon, otherwise it is a bit pricey. My last visit here did not go very well. There was a discrepancy in the pricing (it was discounted) and the cashier argued with me about it. I'm not the type that goes into a situation knowing I'm absolutely right so I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt! Alas, a calculator proved I was correct and even after that was figured out, she still did not honor the price that was supposed to be given. I probably won't be going back here because of that...I left the store happy to have my fabric but very frustrated that I had overpaid and not received great customer service.

My shopping experience here was similar to that of a used car dealership. It was obvious from the time I walked in that the employees work on commission. Fine -- no big deal. However, I draw the line when I'm reminded of it for the entirety of my visit by probing questions, random salespeople checking on me in my dressing room (guy that works there -- I don't feel comfortable talking to you while I'm changing,) and the pièce de résistance; as I'm checking out, our original sales associates said to the cashier, "You made sure to put my numbers in for her, right?"   Really? The clothing here is high end and pricey. I don't expect that kind of behavior when I'm thinking about buying a $200 pair of jeans. The best thing this store did for me was have enough selection so I could figure out what I liked and order it somewhere else. Pathetic.

Hanny's is a little different. We went on a Saturday night for a drink but they weren't overly busy. After waiting at a bar with two bartenders for 15 minutes (with very few customers) I ordered my drink. It wasn't made correctly and the bartender held on to my card even though I wanted to close out. That took another 5 minutes to get back. Overall, not impressed.

Fresh and Easy is a nice, quick stop for something satisfying to eat. As a general rule, I don't usually do the majority of my grocery shopping here. Their produce seems very overpriced to me and being that veggies are the primary food group for my family, it does not make much sense for me. However, their pre-made meals are great. The soups are delicious and we frequently grab one of their pasta dinners to share for dinner. Their breakfast burritos are also pretty good :) For what it offers, this is a good place to buy your groceries--just don't go into it expecting the variety of goods you may see at Fry's.

Love MyoSymmetrix! I've had the pleasure of being Jessica's client for about three years now. I found her while preparing for my first half marathon and booked her for sports massages during any subsequent trainings. Within the last year, she has been a lifesaver by providing me with prenatal massages. Jessica is a lovely person and an expert in her field. Hoping she stays in Old Town for years to come!

This Farmers' Market is a little sparse in the summer months and rightfully so. There does not seem to an abundance of produce when it's consistently 110 degrees outside. However, fall through spring is perfection and I love spending my Saturday mornings here. Wonderful vendors, fantastic products and a great way to experience Old Town Scottsdale.

I've been a customer of Blanco's for quite a while now. It's a go-to place for girl's night or a quick bite with my hubby. Unfortunately, Blanco has lost both my husband and I as patrons.  On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect.   An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right.   I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now. Thanks for the help, Blanco!

I've unfortunately never been to this location as it is a bit far for me but I am frequent customer of their booth at the Scottsdale farmer's market. Probably my favorite thing to purchase!  Caroline is always so friendly and clearly has a passion for their family business. It's quite difficult to find vegetarian tamales, forget about vegan options. The Tamale Store provides a wide array of both. No lard here! They're surprisingly affordable, easy to steam (they're frozen) and oh-so-yummy.   I love all the veggie options but my fave are the black bean and cilantro tamales (vegan). Looking forward to visiting the actual store if I'm even in their neck of the woods.

Cornish Pasty is...wow. It's almost indescribable. It's really that good. First of all, any pub that has Hoegaarden on draft is automatically a winner in my book. When you add that plus a great happy hour, life is good. If you just want to get your drink on after a long day at the office, Cornish is hard to beat. If you want to drink AND eat (two of the best things a person can do) you will have an evening to remember. I'm vegetarian and this place has a ton of options for me. The Veggie Oggie and The Greek are my favorites--make sure you get a side of HP if they have it. You won't regret it. As long as this place is open, my husband and I will be frequent visitors.

I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good.   Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes!   P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)

Paw Placement is like a breath of fresh air in what can be a very dismal and depressing line of work. Animal rescue is of such importance and rarely gets the attention it deserves. The directors and volunteers of Paw Placement truly make a difference---that deserves a stellar review.   We first encountered this rescue when we adopted our cat from them 4 years ago. The first thing I noticed was its criteria to adopt an animal from them. Their guidelines are in place to ensure a pet doesn't go to just any home, that it will be cared for and loved. Also, they are sure to socialize their adoptable animals to give that dog/cat the best chance at being adaptable in a new home.   The directors of this rescue are informative, helpful and obviously passionate about what they do. It shows in the way the rescue is operated and in the dedication given to homeless animals. When we decide to add another furry member to our family, we will certainly go to Paw Placement. Thank you for all you do!

Wow...where has this place been all my life? Or at least since I moved to Phoenix :) By far and away the best pie I've had in the Valley. At Yelp's suggestion, we tried out this joint with another couple and we all had a great experience. Our wait on a Friday night was only about 15 minutes and during the short interim, we hit up the bar for some drinks. After being seated, our very friendly server explained the specials and took our orders. Between the four of us, we ordered olives, Caesar salads, funghi, BBQ chicken and Yukon gold pizzas. Holy schmoly were they good. It is difficult to find crust like that and you can tell they have the right type of oven to make an amazing pie. The large pizza is plenty big for two people and the pizza my husband and I split (the funghi) was ahhhhhmazing. The flavors were bold, rich and oh so satisfying.   The quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge. Affordable+delicious+great service = a returning patron.

What a shame. It has been 3 years since Mumford and Sons have been to Phoenix and they played at this mess of a venue. We had lawn seats and it was a cluster. We could barely hear the band out on the lawn. How they played for 90 minutes without someone who worked at the venue making any adjustments is beyond belief. It also took an hour to get out of the parking lot. Totally disorganized, never again!

I scheduled a move-in cleaning with the owner the day before we needed it done. I appreciated her getting back to me so quickly and her willingness to fit me into their schedule. That was about the extent of any positive experience I had with them.  I was given an arrival time of 2-3 pm. At 3, the owner contacted me saying the girls were running about half an hour late...no big deal. At 4:15, no one had come yet. I was then called by the crew saying they had run out of gas and would have to reschedule. I said that would not be possible because the reason I needed the cleaning done that day was because we were moving in the following day. They said they would try to get on the road and figure something out. At 6 pm they finally arrived. The girls were very sweet but on top of everything that had happened, I was expecting a thorough cleaning. They did a great job on the bathrooms but I felt everything else was either brushed over or not noticed at all. One reason we needed cleaning was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. At the end of our cleaning, there was still hair and dirt on the "mopped" kitchen floor, the inside of the fridge, freezer and cabinets had not been touched. I don't know if my experience was a fluke but it added a lot of anxiety to an already stressful week. My husband and I have spent the last three days cleaning what should have already been a clean townhouse. I still ended up paying what I would have if the correct appointment time had been kept and at the end of all of it, I received an e-mail saying if I did a Yelp review I would receive $20 off my next appointment. So here I am, writing my review. Although I do not anticipate using my discount because I will not be using this company again.

We called Palladino's the day before we needed to get the carpets cleaned in a townhouse we were moving to in Scottsdale. The owner was able to schedule us quickly which was very much appreciated. The representative who came the next morning to clean our carpets was great (apologies, I cannot remember his name.) He was friendly, professional and was able to get the job done quickly. The main reason we needed the carpets cleaned/deodorized was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. The cleaning helped with the hair/smell but idid not get rid of it completely, maybe because that type of issue with carpet needs more than one treatment. Either way, we were pleased with our overall experience with the company and will most likely be using them again in the future.

Happy hour or not, I love 5th and Wine. They have a great selection of wine ($5 on HH,) the service is always great and the food is tasty. There are few better ways to spend a Friday afternoon than sipping on a glass of red and nibbling on apple/fig bruschetta. Delish. Did I mention $5 glasses of wine?! They have a nice patio and it's a great way to enjoy Old Town Scottsdale. 5th and Wine, you hold my heart and taste buds in the palm of your hand.

It pains me to write this because I have never had a bad experience at a Port of Subs. However, this store became the exception to my rule this week. I went at lunch time so it was understandably busy but I wasn't greeted or acknowledged until I was served. I order the vegetarian sandwich. This is where my visit went downhill. This particular location only has one meat/cheese cutter--which means that the meat AND the cheese are sliced on the same machine--which means that even their "vegetarian sandwich" is going to have meat goo on it. BUMMER. This is a deal breaker for me but because I had already waited so long to be served I didn't have time to go anywhere else to get food. As I was checking out, I was charged for the avocado I asked for on my sandwich even though it states on the menu that it is included. The less-than-helpful cashier argued with me about it and at the end, I still ended up getting charged. Absolutely, positively will not be returning to this location.

Our baby was delivered at Obsorn but we did take birthing classes at Shea. It is a top notch facility with a state-of-the-art NICU (not offered at Osborn). It did have a very large, hospital feel to it and they deliver 4 times as many babies as their smaller counterpart in Old Town. Not our cup of tea but nice to know its there in case we need it in the future. Parking is a nightmare.

The idea behind Bahama Bucks is genius...especially in a place like Arizona. Delicious, refreshing and very affordable. I have frequented many of their locations but this one is the closest to my house. I try to branch out with their many flavors but usually end up getting the same thing--strawberry colada with tropical cream. You won't be disappointed!

Have you ever been to a doctor's office where everybody knows your name? Yes, that is beyond cheesy. Yes, it is an amazing thing.   I've been a patient of Dr. Reuss for a little over two years. He recently delivered my daughter (a tiny ball of perfection) at the Scottsdale Osborn Family Birthing Suites. From my first appointment to the big day, he was everything I had hoped for in an OB/GYN. As a first time mom, I had a a fair amount of questions prepared for each appointment. Dr. Reuss was always patient, never rushed our appointments and was very communicative throughout my pregnancy. If only all doctors could be so great.  The office staff is also on a different level of wonderful. Shoutout to Mary, Gabriela, and Alee. Kind, supportive, and always friendly, these ladies are amazing. The total package includes a superb doctor, excellent office staff, and open availability when scheduling appointments.  I'm so grateful I was referred to this practice by a dear friend. Having a baby is beyond emotional. The treatment I received at this office calmed my crazy mommy brain from start to finish.

I really enjoy this Starbucks and wish it was closer to my home. Most Starbucks are created equal as far as product goes but this location offers superb customer service. The employee working the drive-thru is always incredibly friendly and makes small talk..a nice gesture that doesn't happen very often anymore. Will return whenever I can for my caramel macchiato!

We have been patrons of Pet Club for quite some time. While this location does not seem quite as big as some of the others, they still carry a wide variety of goodies that are sure to make any pampered pooch (or cat!) very happy. Being that both of our pets are on a holistic and grain-free diet, Pet Club is an obvious choice for their food needs. They carry a wide variety of foods that are difficult to find in the big chains. At the risk of sounds like a pet-owning snob, I appreciate that these stores carry plenty of foods that don't include the yucky stuff most people don't want to know is in their pet's food. The employees are knowledgeable about the products they carry and the items are reasonably priced.

This restaurant has become a lunch favorite at my work. It has great food (their yellow curry is fantastic), wonderful customer service and reasonable prices. If I had to critique anything, it would be their location. They are located in the huge shopping center that used to house Basha's and Target...now empty. It is somewhat of a ghost town but don't be fooled! This is a family owned restaurant that you will be glad you visited.

Dr. Wachtel and staff are top notch. They are professional, friendly and very knowledgeable in their field. I also appreciate their appointment availability including late afternoons and some Saturdays. As a working lady, I need this kind of flexibility to establish a good relationship with any office.   It is no easy task to walk in to an orthodontist's office as an adult -- it can be intimidating and it is a big step to undergo treatment. Dr. Wachtel is well worth the cost and I am so excited to start my Invisalign adventure!

After reading reviews on Richardson's, I wasn't sure what to expect. I grew up on New Mexican fare and it is not an easy cuisine to perfect. I was also a little reluctant toward the menu as their vegetarian options seemed few and far between.   We visited the restaurant with another couple who are avid carnivores. We were pleasantly surprised to find something on the menu for everyone. My husband and I split the chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. The beans are vegetarian but the rice is not so in lieu of it, we were able to get a green chili potato (ridiculously tasty). The food was delightfully packed with heat -- the kind of heat that's cured by a bowl of ice cream or more of what caused the burn in the first place. It IS spicy so be sure to heed the warning on their menu. I dabbed my forehead with a napkin more than once.   To me, there's something about a server who knows her stuff. Our server was fantastic. We wanted for nothing during our entire experience and she knew exactly what was safe for us to eat as vegetarians.   I don't agree with others who think this place is overpriced. Our party of four had the same number of entrees, a bottle of wine, and two cocktails for $120. And yes, they only have valet parking. Welcome to any good restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait to visit again and get my sweat on!

Yeah, it's a little overpriced for burgers but it is not out of the norm compared to other joints like this ie; Coal Burger, Modern Burger, etc...  We have eaten here two times. Both times I ordered the Zinburger sub the veggie patty and add truffle aioli. Both times it was great. I will admit our first visit we each ordered a side of fries which was way too much food. One order is enough to split between two people. The milkshakes are stellar and are alone worth the trip to Biltmore.  Definitely expect a wait if you go during the weekend. Other than watching others get to eat before you, I have no complaints. Good service, good food, good restaurant!

While it is somewhat embarrassing to write a review on how good a donut shop is, I feel I must do it. Bosa is hands down the best place in the Valley to eat a donut. They're indescribably good. I've been to many of the locations and they all seem to be consistently good. The product they serve is outstanding and I have been ruined for all other donuts because of this funky little shop.

This was a well organized run with a great turnout. 2013 was my first year running and I plan to continue running in future races! This is a great cause, the entrance fee is very affordable and most importantly, the run s a wonderful showing of support for the memory of Pat Tillman.

There are few things cuter in this life than a bunch of babies swimming together. I love that Hubbard offers free classes to infants who are 2-6 months old. It's a great way to bring in new business and it gives parents a test run of what regular swim classes will be like.  Miss Amy was our teacher for the last 3 months. She's unfortunately no longer with Hubbard but we really enjoyed the time we had with her. Classes are only thirty minutes long which is plenty of time when dealing with a newborn. We've had tears. We've had laughs. It's a crapshoot but always a lot of fun.  My only complaint is the cost after 6 months. Approximately $80 a month for one class a week, I can't imagine we'll be able to financially commit to this until our little one is well past a year old and in a solid routine. Until then, we probably won't continue with lessons until she's older.

My sister's wedding was at Clayton in September 2012 and it was absolutely stunning. This is a modern space in the heart of Old Town, perfect for a chic and elegant wedding. The staff were all wonderful and while I cannot remember the event coordinator's name, she was lovely and catered to our every request. As are many places in Scottsdale, pricing for this venue is steep and you may want to look elsewhere if you are on a tight budget.   Fantastic!

We splurged and went to iPic for the midnight showing of Happy Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (it's ok to be jealous.) We had never been there before and while we have visited similar theaters in other cities, we didn't quite know what to expect from iPic. From start to finish, this was a wonderful experience. So wonderful that I think I am ruined for regular movie theaters.   We bought the upgraded seats which are comfy recliners that come with a blanket, pillow and your very own popcorn. The wait staff was very helpful and although we didn't order food, our drinks came out very quickly. It is a bit costly...at $25 for one of these seats it is not something we will be doing every weekend. But for a special night out or a midnight premier (you don't have to wait in line as your seats are reserved) this is a great option! We will be back!

Without a doubt, this is the best buffet in Las Vegas. Will definitely return for bottomless mimosas!

Our family has used Brighton for years. I routinely bring my wedding rings here for cleaning and rhodium plating. Everything is done in house; no nonsense where your jewelry is shipped off to a third party. They are affordable, trustworthy and a great local business.

My co-workers and I just ate lunch here for the first time. The food was great, delivery time was fast and the prices were very reasonable. I had the hot and sour soup which was delicious and filling. Will definitely eat here again!

I have not eaten here for about a month due to a nasty case of food poisoning I am sure was from this restaurant. For sushi, we will stick with Mikado which is right across the street.

Beautiful fields and a brand new facility. This is a great place to catch a spring training game. The food is pretty standard fare with a few curve balls (get it?) that showcase Arizona culture. Looking forward to next spring!

I'm a bit disappointed in myself for not visiting Arcadia Farms sooner. I've lived in Arizona long enough that a meal here should have been a priority long ago! Better late than never, I suppose.  To all who live in the Valley, you know how exciting it is when the weather takes a turn for the better and the thought of eating a meal on a lovely patio makes you jump out of your chair. This place has that whimsical patio that you could sit on and drink mimosas for hours. The service was very good and the food was delicious. My sister and I both had the wild mushroom tart which was savory, satisfying and oh-so-good. The only reason I am not giving Arcadia five stars is because I have to be a bit of a vegetarian snob. There weren't that many veggie options (at least for brunch), I think only two or three menu items.   I look forward to to returning here to check out their breakfast and will definitely be a repeat customer.

We have been patrons of Pet Club for quite some time. If I'm in a pinch, I'll suck it up and head to Petsmart...but this store is worth the trip when I need to make my big purchases. Being that both of our pets are on a holistic and grain-free diet, Pet Club is an obvious choice for their food needs. They carry a wide variety of foods that are difficult to find in the big chains. At the risk of sounds like a pet-owning snob, I appreciate that these stores carry plenty of foods that don't include the yucky stuff most people don't want to know is in their pet's food. The employees are knowledgeable about the products they carry and the items are reasonably priced.

We recently saw Tom Papa at Stand Up Live and while he was hilarious, I was less than impressed with the venue. This experience was overall much better than our tickets for Pablo Francisco over the summer. We chose the earlier show this time  which started right on time and didn't have nearly as many openers.   My husband and I both opted for the 'bottomless' fountain drink to cover our two drink minimum. Our server was nowhere to be found after our initial drink service and she reappeared 15 minutes before the end of the show with our first refill and the check. She was all over the place, never said thanks for coming in (or anything of the sort) and refused to smile. It's a comedy club! It is definitely tight quarters without much wiggle room. I am sure we'll be back because they really do have the best headliners in the Valley. However, I would expect better service as this is not a cheap night out. After tickets, the drink minimum and gratuity included in the tab (for just two people?) we easily dropped $100. Hoping for a happier server next time around.

I've eaten at Zoe's a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed. The food is fresh and delicious, the customer service is great and you can't beat the location. Who doesn't want a lunch break after a long day shopping at Fashion Square? I'm a big fan of the tuna sandwich and tomato soup combo. Yum!

I have gone to EVD since I moved to Arizona 6 years ago. The entire staff is professional, friendly and it seems they do not have a high turnover rate because most of the girls that were there when I started going are still employed there. To me, that speaks volumes about a doctor's office. While I have seen many of the medical providers here, I am a patient of Dr. Chen's. She is an amazing doctor and is sure to explain everything thoroughly to me. I appreciate feeling like I am a valued patient as this is something that slips through the cracks with many medical providers. As long as I am living in the Valley, I will be a patient at East Valley Dermatology.

I stopped going to this practice when they simply became too busy for me. As a patient who needs yearly exams by a dermatologist, I came to expect a solid relationship with my doctor. Five minutes in an exam room was no longer sufficient for me. I've since found a wonderful dermatologist in Old Town Scottsdale. Such a bummer that this office went downhill so quickly.

It is every girl's worst nightmare...finding a new hairstylist. I have been faced with this daunting task for a couple of months now. After asking for peer references, I was referred to Ally at Saskia. I quickly made an appointment and am so glad I did!   The salon itself has only been open for a short time. The decor is comforting, the ambiance relaxing and all staff members are very friendly. At the risk of sounding dated, I have learned that a business that provides good customer service is certainly one worth returning to. I was also appreciative of the Audrey Hepburn movies playing in the back room :)  Ally was a delight and obviously very good at what she does. After doing a quick initial meeting, we got to work on fixing my starved-for-attention hair. I have very thick and finicky hair--this seemed to be no problem for my new fabulous stylist. After my partial highlight and cut, I happily paid my bill knowing that it was well worth the services rendered. Looking forward to my next appointment at this up and coming salon!

Saskia Salon is still my go-to for almost 3 years now. In the time I have been a client, I have gone through multiple (and radical) style/color changes, enjoyed my sister's wedding day with a BEAUTIFUL do and also learned how to manage my crazy hair. Ally is a true talent in her industry. It has been lovely getting to know Saskia, the other stylists and staff.   I trust them completely with my hair and also enjoy a mani/pedi with Ally when my color is setting. Saskia Salon, you complete me :)

I am so glad I stumbled upon this place! Amanda is an expert in her industry. She gives me the perfect brow wax every visit. This wax salon is clean (no double-dipping EVER!) friendly and affordable. I plan to be a long-term client here.  PS--free pair of panties with a Brazilian wax. How great is that?!

Since my previous review, I became a regular client of Jessica's. I really liked her -- always gave me a top notch wax and is so friendly. So why the two stars?  I'm not sure when/why the switch happened but the front desk has morphed from customer service to high-pressure sales. I'm guessing this stems from the owner as I've had many conversations with her about their package deals. I get it, you guys make more money in the long run with these deals. Ask me once, ask me twice, sure! No big deal. However, I draw the line at being barraged about it every single visit. For a nice wax salon, I expected better. I've stopped going here solely because of the uncomfortable check-out experience.

Hobby Lobby could be described as highly addictive and dangerous to those with a shopping problem. I really love this store and it seems to have a little bit of something for everyone. They have a great selection of decor items and all of it is very reasonably priced (especially when you have a coupon or they are running a sale.) The customer service is good and the only complaint I can provide is their check out system...it is dreadfully slow. Worth the wait for my shabby chic goodies. So happy this location is finally open!

I thought this place was too good to be true for a while. Cheap drinks, good food, great service...O.H.S.O. is the total package. They have an amazing selection of beer and a great happy hour ($6 for a pitcher?!) We love their dog-friendly patio, especially during the winter/spring months in AZ. Brunch on the weekends is also fantastic. $10 for your meal and a monster mimosa. LOVE this place!

I was so disappointed by Teres. I came here the last week of my pregnancy, ready for some pampering before the big day. I made an appointment and arrived 5 minutes early. 40 minutes later, I was seated for my pedicure without any mention of the delay.   Without too many boring details, the next 90 minutes included my nail tech cutting my toe, cutting a cuticle on my finger (because she was talking to another tech and not paying attention) and a conversation between employees about going to Mexico, getting drunk and flashing people. I gave this place a shot because they market themselves as an upscale salon. My experience included upscale prices but poor service/quality.

My husband and I were married in April 2009 and I certainly regret not reviewing Muscleman Music sooner. Jason and Kerri are a fantastic couple. They are professional, wonderfully kind and easy to work with.   Jason was a a great DJ. He was attentive to our likes/dislikes and made sure to stick to what we had spoken about before the wedding day. No chicken dance, thank you very much! He was approachable, even when mini-bridal meltdowns occurred and was thoughtful toward any questions we may have had.   Kerri acted as a planner for our event. While our venue came with a wedding planner, she was extremely helpful when it came to details, contacting vendors, etc...she also provided our linens for us at a very reasonable rate. They were beautiful and she really had an eye for what worked, what didn't work and most importantly, what made her clients happy.   I would recommend these two for any of the services they offer. They will take the stress out of 'vendor madness', as I lovingly call it, and make sure you receive all the attention you deserve for your big day. Thanks, Jason and Kerri!

So glad we found this little gem that just opened in the heart of Scottsdale. We brought our dog here for the first time over the weekend and in doing so have found a new go-to place for not only grooming but for pet food, goodies and toys!  Upon entering Wag N' Wash we were greeted with smiles, hellos and and a first timer tour of the building. Our primary reason for going was to utilize their self-wash setup. We chose the ultimate wash which includes an upgraded soaping machine, leave-in conditioner, cologne, brushes, towels, drying, etc...Our pup isn't the easiest dog to bathe but it was certainly an easier experience here than struggling with him in the bathtub at home! While we only have used this option, it seems a good idea to spend the extra $4 and upgrade to ultimate wash!  After Dexter was clean as a whistle (and smelled good to boot) we roamed around the store. They offer a variety of toys and collars that you would not normally find in a Petsmart type store. They also have an in-house kitchen/bakery that offers homemade treats and goodies for our four-legged friends. We're looking forward to ordering a birthday cake for our little man this fall!  Other than the self-wash, another main draw of this store is their selection of food. They offer a huge selection of lesser known but wholesome and nutritious foods you find rarely at the large pet stores. Steve, one of the owners, took the time to talk to us about our pup's health and nutrition. He offered us organic and natural solutions to what otherwise has been a situation where our dog has be on prescription foods and supplements. As a pet-parent that encourages a grain-free diet and doesn't want to pump my kids full of unnecessary remedies, I really appreciated Steve's knowledge and advice in the matter.   Yay, Wag N' Wash! We can't wait to come back and visit. We'll work on his jumping habits before Dexter comes back :)

Our dog had a severe allergic reaction to a deshedding treatment they now offer. The response when we alerted them of this was indifferent at best. Super disappointing as we used to love this place. Unfortunately, we will no longer be patrons.

This facility seems very nice and while I am not a senior, it does offer classes and activities that apply to my age group! Most recently, my husband and I enrolled in a beginning French course that is once a week for 3 months. It was much more affordable than a traditional college course and I hope have a solid grasp on the subject when all is said and done.  The building itself is nice and in a lovely area of Scottsdale. There is a small but adequate exercise equipment area and I have also noticed some gals shakin' it to Zumba. Not the caliber of LA Fitness or 24 Hour by a long shot but might be nice for those preferring a quiet workout atmosphere.

My go-to quick burrito stop, America's is great. Their refried beans are vegetarian (sometimes hard to find) and a basic bean and cheese burrito is my old faithful. The staff is very friendly and you can't go wrong with the pricing. Cheap, fast and delish.

Dr. Johnsen treated me for a sports related knee injury. He was professional, efficient and most importantly, got me back to my running routine with minimal pain. Their office is also convenient as all imaging (MRI and X-ray) are in house. Will be back if needed!

Where to begin. This facility deserves five stars in every way. We toured the center two months before the arrival of our baby and pre-registered for the big day. Check in was a breeze. We were taken straight to our large and very private L&D suite.   Our nurses, Dani and Shauna, were amazing. The level of care they provided was fantastic. They kept me and my husband calm, even during times of uncertainty. We had their full attention as I was their only patient. You see so many faces when having a baby but everyone was lovely. Our baby's nurse was sweet and tender with her and after the shift change, our new nurses were also wonderful. It was clear my doctor also had a good relationship with the staff. Everyone advocated for me which is indescribably important.   We spent two nights in couplet care upstairs. Our little family cozied up and our room included a nice recliner that laid into a bed for the mister. Our baby stayed in suite with us the entire time and true to form, she and I received excellent care. Shout out to Wanda for being so supportive to this new mommy.   Osborn also offers lactation consultations, both during the hospital stay and after discharge. I highly recommend welcoming your new bundle of joy at Osborn. Our experience was bliss.

This is a solid choice for good pizza. It's not gourmet but is certainly leaps and bounds above a Domino's or Pizza Hut. They are consistent in both the quality of food and delivery time. We are now loyal customers to this little strip mall gem!

You can't hit the snooze button on a Saturday if you want to avoid a lengthy wait. As long as we arrive early in the morning, I'm all about this place. The service is great, the coffee flows freely, and the food is on point. Because carbs run the world, I usually go with the spuds deluxe. One day, I hope to venture out and try something new. Cute patio when the weather is nice.

I hate how much I love Whole Foods. This particular location has stellar customer service, an outstanding hot bar, and overall great food selection. We've also taken to buying our little's formula and baby food here when we're in a pinch and Amazon can't deliver fast enough :)   I can't give five stars because of the prices here. I'm on board paying more for high quality, organic, cruelty-free products.  Unfortunately, other grocery stores are catching on to this trend and I can easily find my favorite almond milk somewhere else for a fraction of the price. That being said, of course I'll be back. Duh!

I've toyed with my rating on this one. On one hand, I've received questionable service at this location a few times. On the other hand, I LOVE everything about this pub. When potatoes are your favorite food (like they are mine) and you could eat soup even when it's 115 degrees out (like I do), there's no better place than Cornish. Oh, did I mention it's a dream for vegetarians? Seriously, you'll be impressed with the number of options they have.   This is good, hearty food that hits the spot. My go-to meal can be any variation of the eggplant parm pasty, the cream of leek, potato, and stilton soup, or the Greek pasty. Great for splitting as the portions are huge. Particularly on a chilly, Arizona winter night, I love grabbing a bench, sipping on a pint, and wishing I was half as cool as the hipster staff here.  Five stars: all day, err day.

I'm so happy Merci (formerly known as Scratch) is back in business. The service is better than ever and the menu has been slightly revamped. Great for a croissant and espresso or a full meal. The open-faced Brie sandwich is like heaven on French bread.   Don't forget a macaroon for the road!

We heard about Jim through Stilwell Pianos (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/stilwell-pianos-tempe) and he moved our piano from Mesa to Phoenix last October. I was so impressed with his punctuality, professionalism and friendly personality. He picked up the piano from a residence in Mesa, brought it to Phoenix and placed it carefully in our home ensuring it was exactly where I wanted it to be. His pricing was very reasonable and I believe a piano is something that should be moved by a specialist -- spend the extra money and hire someone who knows about pianos! Thanks, Jim!

Such a fun idea for a bar. Low-key, casual, and a great wine/beer selection. Our party of four quickly found a table on a busy Saturday night. We proceeded to play trivia, dominoes, and sip malbec. The service we received was excellent. Our guy was personable, quick with the drinks and knew his stuff. Will be back to this Arcadia strip mall gem.   side note: the proximity to Bosa Donuts is a major win.

Great customer service, reasonable prices, and superb coffee. This little gem in Old Town is better quality than Starbucks and more approachable than Cartel. Their vanilla latte is simple, delicious, and made with real vanilla syrup. The salads and sandwiches are overpriced for what you get but I don't make a habit of stopping by for lunch. A morning cup with a pastry is all I need from this quaint coffee shop.

Harkins always provides great customer service, the most recent films and reasonable pricing. This is our destination theater when we have girl's night out! The parking is a little hellish sometimes but the theater can't be faulted for that...that blame can be placed with whoever designed the mall parking lot!
