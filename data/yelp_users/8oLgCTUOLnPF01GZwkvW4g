great selection of beers on tap!  I am pleased to go into a place that offers a different selection from the normal sports bar, yet still has plenty of the old stand byes!  food is great, happy hour is awesome! I love the daily specials, which encourage me to try something new at a reasonable price as well!  service is rock star super awesome and amazing as well! i usually end up in Joey's section and also had the pleasure of  being served by Kyle this evening.. both are super helpful in helping me decide on a delicious beer and always there with a smile or anything i need!  this is one place id be proud to be a regular at!

I love the $4 fry up for breakfast served till 2PM on sundays along with a bloody mary. Tuesday nights and Thursday nights are great for $3 pints. Always a decent selection and they rotate a few taps often.  Jen is one of my favorite servers/bartenders here.

yummy appetizers on happy hour and very decent drink specials! food was top notch and service is better than i could ever ask for!  i had the pleasure of being served by Derek, he was patient, there when i needed him, always smiling and engaging and most importantly informed me of the specials that weren't on the menu right away!  i will be back!

food is always good! im a fan of their wings, and happy hour!  they have sleepy dog red rover on tap and the servers are always ready to help with anything!  burgers are huge, so when i order one i expect to have leftovers, i was unsure at first because of the price, but soon realized that the portions, service, and quality all made it a smokin deal! not to mention, they always have deals on here and groupon that make it even more affordable!

I just ordered food for delivery online.  the website was easy to use and prices are fair. delivery charge is $2 and with one entree and two sides the bill was less that $20 and fed me and my boyfriend with some leftovers in the fridge for later! i got the orange chicken and ordered it medium spicy.  next time i will absolutely go hot.  the taste is good and sweet but not spicy at all.  i will also ask for the chicken to be cooked a little longer, as a personal preference.  i got 2 spring rolls which are tasty and the crab puffs.  the crab puffs come in a generous portion and there is a lot of meat inside each one with a great taste to it.  I was unhappy with the bread on the outside however, it seemed more chewy and hard than the nice crunch that i was after.  The order came correct, on time, and hot with all of the condiments requested.  I wouldn't get the crab puffs again but i will try some other items from the menu.

typical crowded and loud place with expensive drinks.  I've been in a few times to this location, and typically i would have given this place a couple more stars (not four more, but a couple).  After my visit last night, i will most likely never be returning.  Last evening i got off work where i serve alcohol and food stuffs to people, my boyfriend picked me up and we headed to sandbar to unwind and enjoy the rest of our evening.  We arrived around eleven in the evening, and my boyfriend bought me a vodka sprite.  We proceeded to dance and have fun when a bouncer approached my boyfriend and told him he had to get me out of there, but he could come back, obviously my boyfriend left with me.  i had had ONE drink!!!! now i know i can be exuberant sometimes, and im not a great dancer, but i was not by any means drunk!! nor was i causing any problems or even talking to anyone besides my boyfriend!!!  i feel insulted and i am even more shocked, because the past few times I've been there i have seen people who were clearly over served!!  i highly doubt i will ever return to this place!!

decent selection of beers on tap. i love this place for lunch! im a person that always orders the same thing at every place i go, but this is one of those places that i cant pick just one! you can really tell that they order quality ingredients, and their chicken wings especially are awesome! i also love their buffalo chicken wrap and their jalapeno appetizer.  service is really great as well, i usually sit at the bar and am served by Gina.  she is great at her job and i don't know how she does it, but she seems to always be in a good mood! one of the managers named Eric has also gone out of his way for me.  I told him one time that i really wish they had honey hot sauce for their wings, and he told me "next time you come in, we will have it". its not on the menu, but he made it happen for me!  This place is great for lunch and easy to get to being right off the 101, but even if it wasn't, id still probably go out of my way to get there.

i love how they have a lot of the american comfort food i crave, but with their own little signature twist! I've had the monkey burn, their meatball app, and a super delicious salmon dish among others and everything was great!  i also love supporting local beers and nimbus makes it so easy!  my only problem is deciding which one!  i tried their Monkey Shine the other day, and wow! i do love a barley wine! hit the spot!!!  also, service there has always been great! i stop in usually for a later lunch and even when its slow my servers have been attentive, friendly, and give me my space when i need it (sometimes i stop in to do homework after class and need some peace and quiet to study).  My last visit in, Daniel waited on me, he was laid back with a huge smile!  Even though he was bar tending and i chose to sit at a table in the dining area (studying!) he didnt make me feel like i had him going out of the way for me or was a burden in anyway.  food came out promptly and he made sure my glass was always full!  i look forward to my next visit in!

i stopped in this evening at the loathing thought of having to cook during finals week.  I decided to walk in so i could take my time looking at the menu.  I was greeted right away as i walked in, and my first thoughts were 'wow this place is really clean'.  I stepped up to the counter and Jacob was eager to help me pick out something, making several recommendations of items on the menu he liked.  I decided to go with the crispy chicken sandwich. When i got home and opened my box, i realized that this was the first time i had ever gotten fast food and what i ordered actually looked as good as the picture!  the taste did not let me down one bit either! overall, Culver's appears to be clean, staffed well with employees eager to help and give great service, and the food exceeds my expectations of what i would expect from a fast food joint.  I must say also that i have tried their custard on several different occasions from another location and they are fantastic! i am regretting not ordering a vanilla custard with oreos as i type this!

if you want a place where the staff talks shit about you to all the other employees and customers, come here!  Or if you want to sit yourself at a table (as directed) and wait 5 or minutes for a server, come here! service at tables is beyond slow and completely terrible.  servers (and bartenders) have no knowledge of draft beers, or even what they have.  I get that there is a lot of beers on tap and the taps change, which is cool, but when I ask about a unique beer or a specific type on draft, I expect an answer besides "I don't know".  I wanted to love this spot for its dive bar feel, selection of draft beer, and food served till 2 AM, but the service and management make it really hard to like.  specifically Michelle, goes out of her way to avoid you, if she doesn't like you, which would be fine if she didn't tell her coworkers and other customers how much she hates you, which all of them will gladly remind you of.  Her unprofessionalism of bringing up past (4 or 5 years ago) issues dampers the atmosphere and adds and high school drama feel to the whole place.  And don't bother talking to management, regardless of her unprofessionalism, poor judgment, poor service, and flat out rudeness the owner will take her side, even though he is losing major money in his pocket!  regardless of a "past history" with Michelle or not, I can guarantee that you will have poor service, overpriced beers, and an uncomfortable atmosphere.  I will never be back to this establishment and would much rather take my business to another local business with professional servers, timely service, and reasonable prices.
