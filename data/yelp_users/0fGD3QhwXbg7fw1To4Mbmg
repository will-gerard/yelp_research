Dirty dirty dirty. Food was below average. Prices were cheap but yuck! My friend literally lost his appetite and threw his food out.

I'd say the food is good. Not great but good. The service was friendly and prices were just right. I'll probably be back.

I'm new to the area and this place is 1.5 miles from the street from me so decided to give it a try despite the two star rating. I'm glad I did! It's a laid back bar. Nothing fancy. Part of the bar is indoors part is outdoors which is cool. I had the cowboy burger which consisted of Angus beef, bacon, onion rings...speaking of onion rings, they have some of the best I've ever had! Where was I? Oh yeah, the burger..it was topped off with ghost pepper cheese and bbq sauce. I opted for onion rings instead of fries or sweet potato fries and so happy I did. Remember why!? The onion rings are awesome!! I chased my burger down with a couple of 25oz cold beers which were a great price at $4 each. Apparently they are $3.50 during happy hour. If you are thinking of coming here..go for it! Most people review bars and restaurants when they are angry anyways. If all the happy people made an effort to review this place it would be at least four stars. Cheers!

You guys are a joke.  I was told my internet bill would be $41.95 + tax/month.  The guy who signed me up said that I would get phone service too with that.  I said I don't need phone service but he proceeded to tell me that it's bundled so I get it anyways.  I get my first bill and it's $72.25. Woah! I call Century Link and after an hour on the phone and being passed around to three different people and offered a $27.94/month internet only rate.  Here we are a month later and my bill has not changed.  I call and customer service hangs up on me 15 minutes into the call because they could not find record of the change.  I had a new account number made and a confirmation number and yet they could not find anything on it when I supplied them the information.  So I call back and speak to another customer service rep, he proceeds to tell me there is nothing he can do so they transfer me to loyalty because apparently loyalty can supply the discounts.  I'm on hold for 45 minutes and finally hang up because it's ridiculous I'm dealing with this.  I call back again, the new rep says to call back in the morning when they are not so busy and I can get through.  Wow.  I was warned about Century Link from a neighbor and I still proceeded to go with them. Shame on me for not listening.  They bait and switched me in the beginning, they gave me false account update info to lower my bill, and then they waste more hours of my time dealing with it.  I'm going to the BBB, Consumer Affairs, Yelp, and telling Directv that they need to stop referring customers to their "partner" at centurylink.

Good atmosphere and service. The food is good but not great. We always enjoy coming after church on Sundays.

My family always enjoys themselves here. Service is great, food is fantastic, and beer is cold. I am baffled by the bad reviews about this location. We've been coming every Friday since we moved here four months  and never had an issue.

This took over Paradise Bakery. The food which consists of sandwiches, soups, salads, pastas, and bakery items is fresh and full of flavor. Because of the fresh ingredients it is a little pricey for fast causal but worth it. I love the modern ambience that is very warm and inviting. Make sure to always get one of their amazing bakery items with your meal!
