I am glad that 20 plus years of being a Cardinals fan is finally paying off. Here is to another great season..  Looking forward to the next.

Came here for a beer after work on a Friday and wasn't too impressed. I don't think I am asking too much for my beer to be cold.  I think it was served in a glass that came right out of the dishwasher.

Where els can you go for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for under 5 bucks??  This place was awesome 20 years ago when I came here for lunch in high school and  is still awesome when I bring my kids here now.  I just recently had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was better than i was expecting.  This is also the go to place if we are watching football or just chillen with friends.

I love this place.  This is the closest thing to an East coast bagel that I have found in Phoenix.  The breakfast special is awesome and the eggs are cooked on a grill and not in a microwave like some of the other bagel shops I have been to.  They get really busy on the weekends and sometimes it is hard to find a place to sit.  Good thing I live close and they are just as good to go :)

Good food, decent price. We came here on our way back to Phoenix from Crown King. (annual xmas shopping trip, this time no singing.  See Daren C's review.)  Do yourself a favor and save room for the pie. Even if it is breakfast time.

This is going to make the rotation of small dive bars in our area to frequent.    Came in here planning to just have a beer and relax since I had to work next morning.  Small COLD Blue Moon pitcher and a foo foo drink for my wife were only 8 bucks.  Just as we finished our drinks and were getting ready to leave an outstanding gentleman who's name I can't remember bought the whole bar a round of drinks.  So not to be rude we enjoyed another round.    I can't wait to come here with our whole group of friends.

This is another one of those places that has been here as long as I can remember.  The staff is always friendly and the drinks are inexpensive.  Tipical bar food not too exciting.  Good place to come hang out while getting your car serviced next door.  Plan on making this place a more regular stop for refreshments :)

I have not been to this place in like 10 years.  Got invited to go to lunch today and it was EXACTLY the same as it was the last time I was there.  Buffet was pretty good and the menu has not changed either.  Not much to look at but for a 6.00 lunch what do you expect.

I love this place!  I have been eating here for (holy cow) 20 years.  There used to be 2 other locations but this is the only one left.  Just a normal sub shop but the people are friendly and the menu is cheap.  Took the whole family, wife and 2 kids, here for lunch and it was only like 15 bucks.  Can't beat that in this economy.  The inside is covered in bumperstickers and the tables have 1980's high school pictures lacquered into the table so it keeps the kids entertained.

This is my FAVORITE place to come and hang out with friends.  The food is good and the drinks are even better.  I have been here on Sunday morning to watch football and almost had a seizure because I don't know which tv to focus on because they have all the games playing on multiple tv's. The watresses seem to always be in a good mood and having a good time. I have some of my best drunk memeories from here (Patron) that I can and can't remember.

One of my favorite local dive bars.  Drinks are cheap and the shuffleboard is free.  We have been here numorous times with a small group and never had a problem finding a place to sit.    One of the cool things about  this place is I work graveyard shift and I can come here @ 6am to get a frosty cold adult beverage after a long night of work.

This is my favorite place to buy pool supplies.  Everyone that works here is super friendly and willng to help you figure out any pool problems.    They have everything from chemicals, whole pool cleaner systems and even do repairs on all different kinds of automatic pool vacuums.

Can't beat a coupon for 9.95 for a haircut.  I usually have Chelsea or Debbie cut my hair and they always do an excellent job.

Just recently found out about this place.  Went in with a bunch of old crap and came out with almost a hundred bucks in credit.  I just wish I knew about it before I gave two crates of disney movies to savers.

Went here for lunch last week and was disappointed.  Food was bleh, nothing special.  Probably not a bad place to go grab a drink just too far for me.

Fast, delishious, trucker-sized breakfast.  Bacon was thick, Pancakes were the size of the plates and the service was good.   They were pretty busy and it only took about 10 minutes to get a table for 5 of us.

This is probably one of my favorite places in Westgate.  The beer and a shot specials are usually what i end up with.  For only 7 bucks for a blue moon and a shot of jager it is hard to beat.  They have a really good selection of music with the videos playing on numerous tv's.  The crowd is relaxed and usually is not difficult to find a place to sit.   One thing I have learned the hard way , is when you are sitting on the couches enjoying a frosty cold beverage, watch out for the shin height steel tables that will jump out and bite you.

good New York style pizza lunch special.  just over 5 bucks for 2 slices and a drink.  Also a good place to watch world cup on a lunch break. ( even though I don't know what is going on)

I've been coming to this location since it opened and they always do a decent job.  This trip I also had my oil changed and I was in and out in under an hour.

I went there for lunch with my wife and the service was good.  My wife had a bean and cheese burrito and I had a carne asada burrito.  With 2 cans of soda lunch came to 12 bucks. They had samples of some banana nut bread that my wife said was the best she ever had.  We will definately be going back here again.

Great little neighborhood bar.  Went to watch football on Sunday and had a good time.  Beers were ice cold and not expensive.

Been here a few time and until today had OK service.  Well today I was told that my jeep was extra dirty so I would have to be charged an extra 5 bucks.  That's right, bring your extra dirty car pay the extra dirty price.  So now I am at Danny's Family Carwash not getting charged extra, but less because they took your coupon.  thanks

This is my second visit here and i am happy to say it was way better than after they just opened.    2 egg breakfast with bacon and hash browns were perfect.  Service was excellent and had some sympathy for those of us who were nursing hangovers.

This was kind of a last minute option and kind of wished I had just gone home.  We went for a late dinner and possibly some drinks.  The food was just ok.  the service was horrible for the amount of people that were in there.  There was maye 5-7 tables seated and it took the waitress for ever to do anything.  Probably wont be going back anytime soon.

Perfect place to come to for a drink after work or dinner with the  family.  Just across the parking lot from the AMC 30 so it the perfect place to come for dinner and a movie.  The staff is always friendly and just about everything on the menu is good.

First off I want to thank Daren C. and Ryan C. for inviting me to come here for lunch.  This place is a couple blocks from my house and I did not realize this gem was even here.  Probably one of the best sandwitches I ever had.  I also have the sweet tooth of a five year old, and the dessert was awesome.    Everything inside the stor is fresh and is made here.  The only thing shipped in is the ingrediants.   I will definitely be back

I took the whole family there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and there was about a 20 minute wait to sit down.  Figured it was a good thing that we were not the only ones there.  The chips and salsa were good and the waitress was super busy but still took good care of us.  We all ordered some form of chimichanga and they were all good.  They messed up my order and brought me beef instead of chicken which was ok because the beef had a little kick to it.  The kids had minichimis beef and chicken and they had no complaints.  We will definateley be going back.  Maybe next time we will take advantage of happy hour.

I have now been here twice and both times were excellent.  1st trip there I had probably the best chicken strips I have ever had at a bar.  The owner/chef was kind enough to spend some time at our table to "school" me on the different types of micro brews that were available.  Very helpful.  Second time there I had the steak sandwich and once again was not disappointed.  Not your typical bar food.  They also have live music and beer tasting on thursdays.

I came here for lunch with (burger snob) Daren C. and Ryan C.    So normally at a bbq place I would get the pulled pork but this time I got a bacon cheese burger.  Well Daren did not steer me wrong because this plase serves an excellent burger.  They do not skimp with the bacon either.    Next time I will be trying the pulled pork.  If it is half as good as the burger I will be happy.

Came for lunch again with Daren c.  I had a bacon cheeseberger again.  I swear next time I am going to try something else besides the burger.  Maybe pulled pork or maybe loaded baked potato.

We came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch after the good guys car show.  Had no problems getting seated and the waitress was really friendly.  She even got my 16 year old son to smile for a picture.(impossible to even get him to look at a camera)  Our drinks never were empty and the food was good.  I had the meatloaf and mac and cheese.  Best part of the lunch was watching the scottsdale snobs and their kids coming in and turning right around to leave when they realized they were in the wrong place.  It's really not that bad.  Looking forward to hopefully having one on the west side of town.(hint hint)

Made the mistake of coming here on opening day.  Not a good idea for someone with anxiety issues.  They had a bunch of really good deals, but I fear it is probably going to be the same as going to Walmart.  And I HATE going to walmart.
