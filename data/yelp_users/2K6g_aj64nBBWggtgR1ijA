So soft and shiny! I bought a living social deal for the Coppola Keratin Complex treatment. The salon is clean and comfortable & Frank is the best part of your experience. "a morning person" frank was able to get started on my hair at 7:45 am!! I have had this treatment done more than a dozen times for the last 3 years and I'm impressed with the attention to detail Frank gave each stand of hair. I only wish I would have bought more of the living social deals as the normal price of $340 might be a bit too much for me to keep going back. If they do offer this deal again I will be sure to get it!

This review is specifically for the Nordstrom bridal department. I recently became engaged and have been casually searching for a wedding dress. I went to a trunk show back home in DC at Nicole Miller and decided I wanted a Nicole Miller dress. After searching the greater phoenix area I found it at Nordstrom. I went to several boutiques some nice some not so much and let me say that Deb in the Bridal salon was bay far the most professional and attentive. You would have thought the dress I was buying was $35,000. I went home to think about it and decided to call and order the dress.   The Bridal department at Nordstrom is the same as any other part of Nordstrom and you can return the dress if you change your mind (un altered). I am getting married in Las Vegas next May and Deb let me know that they could ship it to Las Vegas for me and have it steamed there. ! I am really happy with my decision to go with Nordstrom. My best friend and maid of honor is coming into town at the end of April and Deb insisted we come in just to take a look for dresses for her. Nordstrom can be your one stop bridal shop. I plan to get the reception dress and accessories (Lot's of accessories) there too!  UPDATE:!So I ended up returning the dress but still was treated so kind!

While I know most people think of a steak house when they go to the capital Grille. I like to think of It as one of the best French onion soups I have ever had. I am a French onion soup snob. The best thing about Cap Grille is the way they treat you at all of their restaurants. Just moving here from Washington DC this capital grille makes me feel right back at home! I love it!

Chang, Changs getting Changs over here. This is the song that comes to mind when I think of PF Changs. I know this is a chain restaurant but it's DAMN good every time I go. Usually I just get a few appetizers. If you are looking for authentic Chinese cuisine then you are at the wrong place. As a matter of fact authentic Chinese food is really not all it's cracked up to be. this is a great place to go with friends or right before the move. I love the steamed pork dumplings with lettuce wraps and c'mon now the Mongolian been is the ish! If people give this place a bad review because it's a chain then that's just silly. Everyone already knows it's a chain and frankly Changs must be doing something right to be as big as they are.  There are time s I get "Chang-ed out" but I will always end up back there for some yummy spring rolls!  I did choose to review this spot because it is my favorite I love the atmosphere in here and because it's in Tempe it's a younger crowd and laid back so I do prefer this location to others I have been to in my short time in AZ.

So good! Exactly what I have been looking for! I drove about 12 miles just to get the boba tea. I love the "slush" I typically get Mango, Passion fruit or peach flavor. The staff was nice and the place was clean. What more do you need

Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels' the wise words of Kate Moss clearly this chick has not had a sprinkles chai tea cupcake. Well damn I too like to look good in a bikini however not a Friday goes by without me thinking about those sweet sweet chai cupcakes, only available this one day of the week . Perhaps it's the lack of availability that's got poor Kate thinking her bones look better than a chai cupcake. Please sprinkles do us all a factor and make all cupcakes ready to eat everyday!!! Or at least my chai!! I'm officially converted from Georgetown cupcakes red velvet!

I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times,  not because their whack fake boba is that good, but to see if every employee was rude or maybe I caught them on a bad day. I understand hemorrhoids, headaches, tummy bubbles, and domestic issues.  I know everyone has a bad day. Well this place has a freakin' black cloud just chillin over it! Everytime I step in this joint, it's clear that the person behind the counter feels inconvenienced by having to actually make my order. Seriously, I'm ordering a chai tea with boba, not baked alaska. The worst part is I'm in a pissy mood when I leave the place. So I gave it a try and the only thing that comes to mind...... treat me like ass once, shame on you. Treat me like ass twice,  shame on me. Treat me like ass three times, and I'm calling you out. Get a grip tea fusion you are not the only spot in Tempe Market Place, your tea is mediocre at best and your boba is not even legit. I sincerely hope the managers take this review into consideration. And, on one last personal note, If I get another pair of eyes rolled at me when I walk by the store I'll personly sit outside and hand out samples from paradise bakery, coffe bean and juice it up smoothies! All of which offer tea.

Other than the extreme proximity to my home, the only other reason I go to this gym is Oscar. Oscar is my personal trainer that I started with in January 2011. Please understand I don't really use him as I should instead I use him as a friend while working out. Since I moved to AZ and did not really know anyone Oscar is my new friend. However Oscar has got my ass down 12 lbs and in great shape so kudos to hi!   On to the gym. Long story short this place sucks. No towel service, always stinky, no cardio TV, whack group classes this list goes on and on. Maybe I was spoiled at Xport fitness (my last gym) but I don't think so. Seriously this place needs a face lift S.T.A.T. The equipment is falling apart & the music is just awful. I took a spin class and the music selection by the instructor was The Beetles THE ENTIRE TIME! R U KIDDING ME? Spin is supposed to be intense. I can really appreciate all music but I need fast upbeat high tempo music to spin to and nothing about The Beetles does this. I go to 24 hour fitness almost everyday so don't get me wrong I do value that I have a gym here in NE mesa but there is no doubt in my mind that the moment another gym comes around, I and 98% of the other members just might join. Since I have been signed up here I have seen a Manager fighting with another manager, equipment out for days at a time and no cleaning supplies to wipe of your machine after using. Gross! C'mon 24 hour fitness get it together. Oh let me go ahead and say one good thing about the gym. They offer a kids zone that my son loves to go to and it's got pretty good hours although it could be better on the weekends.

This is a very lovely shop.  Amanda who was fantastic was helping me. As far as wedding gown prices are concerned I would say that Mariee is ranked right in the middle. I tried on dressed around $3500 and that's pretty good. I did ultimately get my dress somewhere else but I would still highly recommend stopping by Mariee. They only recently stopped caring the designer I was interested in buying.

I was a bit disappointed at topit cupcakes. I placed an order about a week before I wanted to pick up the cupcakes and when I arrived I still had to wait about 20 minutes for them to be finished. They seem to have not real organized way of keeping track of what customer is next. it was a bit of chaos trying to understand whoso place was in line. the gentleman working at the front even asked "who is next" The place was decorated nice and was very clean. as for the actual cupcakes while they are yummy I did not find them to be gourmet style and worth the $3 per cupcake. I recently moved from the Washington D.C area and had the luxury of George Town Cupcakes and they are spectacular!!! The cupcakes were a bit dry and the frosting was stale too. I am sorry to say that I will have to go else where in the future.    On a side note if you ever find yourself in the D.C. metro area you MUST try Georgetown cupcakes. there is a reason people wait 90 minutes in line for them!

This is a great Starbucks! The Manger Leighton is always so friendly. I used to just go to this bucks while visiting my boyfriend and they would remember my drink and order. Now that I live here it's as if they know when I am about to walk in the door. The team is friendly and the place is always clean.  In addition to all this The team knows about current specials and the goings on with Starbucks so that's cool.
