Starting to warm up to this place - or it might be the twin suns frying my brain.   Some of the bro's and I parked our speeder bikes here to grab a cold one. If you're into brawl scenes, this is your jam. We saw some old dude slice up a couple of punks with a flashlight, watched another alien dude get fried by a pistol, and we hadn't even been there 10 minutes.   What's the draw? Apparently there are some pretty damaged Twi'lek sluts that hang out here and know how to please. Worth it.

This guy is the definition of lifesaver.  Lost my only motorcycle key (it is the love of my life) when I was shopping around one afternoon. Long story short, I lost my keys and decided to catch a ride home.   Called The Lock Guyz the next morning around 7 am (they work early, which is a plus in my book) and they answered my call right away. He actually beat me to the location where my bike was at that morning, and had two keys cut for me right there on the spot within ~10 minutes.   Keys fit the gas cap lid, triple-tree lock, ignition AND helmet storage clip...this has happened to me before (but I found my keys later on) and bike shops have quoted me over $500 to re-key the entire bike. The Lock Guyz only charged me $90. They take cash and cards on site.   When he left, I had trouble getting the key in the ignition for the first time (it's an old bike). I called them, they came back right away to make sure it worked properly, and I was on my way.  The Lock Guyz got me out of serious jam and I'll definitely use them for any/all lost key situations. Good guys to have in your Rolodex when you're out of luck like I was.
