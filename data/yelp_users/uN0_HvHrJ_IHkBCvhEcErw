Amazing! Such a fun little restaurant. It adds character to downtown Phoenix and the food is great! I got the hot cakes, which were huge and tasted so free, with real butter and real maple syrup. The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist. My friend had the special, which was eggs benedict and hashbrowns. Also amazing and you can tell all the ingredients are farm fresh. I'm salvating just thinking about it! The wait wasn't too bad for us. We got their right around 9am and waited for 20 minutes, ate in 40 minutes. However there was quite the line of people after us. I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!

I found Bloom Skin Care on Groupon and since my last name is Bloom I thought it was a sign. Diana is amazing and I couldn't be happier. I'm not able to come in as often as I like, but when I do it's always a good experience. I highly recommend Bloom Skin Care.

Awful. Awful. Awful. First I called to set up an appointment and never heard back for two weeks. I had to call a second time just to get him to call me back. During the appointment I wasted an hour with Gary just for my manicure to chip, peal and come off in chunks within a couple hours. I was expecting a relaxing manicure and all I received was an hour lecture as to why he doesn't do gel manicures. Not to mention that his groupon said "3 gel manicures". He is closed Sunday and Mondays so I waited and called him on Tuesday because who has time to stop in before 6pm on a work day. He never returned my voicemail so I stopped by the salon today. I asked him to divide the groupon by 3 and refund me for the 2 treatments that I didn't use. He refused and said it's my fault that they chipped. I am appalled by his "customer service". If I no longer wanted to use his service you'd think that he would offer a refund for the unused services as a kindness gesture, but instead I paid $60 plus tip for the most awful manicure in my life. He's bit even friendly. He was rude to me the moment I walked in and complained why his client are all 90 years old. Ugh! Thanks for ruining what I thought was going to be a wonderful experience

I met with Megan at the Wedding Expo in January 2013 (a year before my wedding). In our short conversation at the expo I could tell that this is her true passion. She understood my concepts and ideas for my wedding from just a short conversation. A couple months after that my (now) husband and I met at her studio. Her studio is gorgeous and gave us such a good feeling about working with Megan. She listened (actually listened) to our ideas, looked at our Pinterest board, and showed us recommendations of flowers based on what we said, our budget and being that our wedding is in winter.   She really worked with us to stay in our budget without having to take away from our overall ideas. She was able to find these trees that we saw at ZGallerie and allowed us to rent them, which saved us a ton of money. Her and her team also took on a very time consuming and challenging craft project for us, that saved us money and gave us the look that we were going for - they cut many wine bottles to use for the vases which were re-purposed from the ceremony to the reception. The one thing that my husband said when we were deciding between two different florists is that this is Megan's passion and you can tell by talking to her, so we knew we'd get a beautiful display of flowers at our wedding.   The other company we spoke to didn't actually listen to what we wanted and just gave their suggestions for what we should do, at the end of the day they were running a business and we were just another job. With Megan, we felt like we were another masterpiece that she was creating and she just happened to get paid doing what she loves.   Overall the communication with Megan was great during the process. She even met with us at our venue to talk with our wedding coordinator and discuss the layout of the flowers. The day of ran so smoothly that I never had to worry about how the floral arrangements looked, everything was very organized.
