I usually hit old town with my best friend and her SO (also one of my good friends now) - we've been here a bunch of times and have absolutely loved it. Great atmosphere, great jello shots, etc. Tonight was the night of the NAU ASU game and so it was pretty empty and low key. We were directed to Amanda for jello shots who basically ignored us and the request for one not having whipped cream. Whatever. Later we're still here, and it's a friends birthday so my BFF's boyfriend texts him, and Amanda walks by and rudely says, "if you wanted a picture all you needed to do was ask."  like... We are texting. So we go up to her and politely say we'd ask her if she'd pose if we really wanted a picture. She screeched at us and was essentially saying it's too late the damage is done, wah wah. If you're working at this type of bar you can't be a jerk. Yeah. They have smaller people. If we wanted pics, we'd ask. No need to ruin a bar for us there, girly. Either she's starving for attention or she had a miserable night - either way we don't want to come back.

I tried my best to enjoy my time here, but let me give you a little recap. This bar had some good positives but some of the negatives really threw me off. As we walk into the bar, you know, it looks great - loud, live, music that the crowd is enjoying. Great. That was nice. We went straight outside and ordered two AMFs and a jack/coke. The two AMFs were COMPLETELY SOUR tasting. The female added two chunks of lemon to each drink and this was not an AMF you would want to drink - I wouldn't mind if I said, please add this lime, but as we were tipping she just put them in there. Probably the worst AMF I have ever had. Ok, I'll manage, you know, since we're pretty drunk already. We chug our drinks because there's absolutely no way you can slow and casual sip a sour drink. Luckily, the bartender we had the pleasure of being tended by on the inside of the first floor was a life saver. He made two great pink p's for me and my girlfriend while her boyfriend had a redbullvodka. All the while this bartender is being very attentive and giving us plenty of water as we ask for it (I am not one for having a hangover!) Seriously, nicest bartender I've experienced in downtown scottsdale. So we made our journey to the second floor which has HORRENDOUS stairs.. Who has stairs like that for drunk people? I admit, the patio looked nice and the cushions were comfortable. They had good dance music on the inside, but the DJ could have been a little more into the crowd. Anyway. We didn't stay long on the second floor but on the way out we did visit the bartender inside and get another cold glass of water. He was a lifesaver!  Do go - if you want to relive the 70s and 80s Do not go - if you want to enjoy some drunk mosh pit!

Service is usually very sloppy in this location and they often mess up orders.  Figured I could be more descriptive.. My family loveees tacos. With a passion. But every time we seem to visit this location we're lucky to get our orders correct. Plain is plain! -_- it's cool to stop by when the Diamondbacks win, but eh, we've moved on :(

Looooove the food so much. Always go with some kind of fried rice, although chicken fried rice is my favorite. If you ever need a quick fix, this place is wonderful and the portion sizes are good too. Even a small dish has a ton of food (I had eaten it and forgotten to take a picture for the review, oops... It was that good). My family often orders their orange chicken, fried rice, and soup.

Went here for my new employer's mandatory drug test - I came an hour before they stopped testing and I hadn't had enough fluids. Luis mentioned that if you cannot complete it they mark it as failed. So he waited an extra hour and a half for me to drink another six and a half water bottles so I could submit my samples. He was very nice and sweet, was taken care of quickly even though the place was a little busy!

Kathy usually does her best to take  great care of me and my nails. The other two techs I have spoken with when being helped by Kathy also seem very nice. Can get busy. I have had one or two unfortunate mishaps here from other techs filing too much and making my cuticles hurt. Overall though I can't complain. It's usually very quick in here once you are seated.  I've since moved on to greener pastures where my nails don't hurt!

Love the Dbacks stadium. As every review says - this is the friendliest team. The experience from food, patrons, staff - all unbelievably amazing. If I had the opportunity to come all the time, I would!

Food was cold, shrimp not properly cooked through, workers seemed to be uninterested in service, I suppose you get what you pay for though!

I've been here twice and this is also my mother's podiatrist. I came in here two years ago to have my old botched ingrown toenail removed (my old podiatrist took out BOTH sides, very painful, it never grew correctly on the bottom) and both doctors made sure it was less painful for me.   I bumped my big toe the other day and it bumped the nail the wrong way, I cut my nail and it felt awful. . I needed an appointment immediately and they scheduled me for the same day (Rebecca is a sweetheart! -  their receptionist). I needed to have the nail cut on one side and I was in and out of there quickly with good advice on how to help my foot heal as quickly as possible. Dr.  Abraham is the sweetest and I was out of there super quick. Love the service and friendly environment

I've always been blown away here.. From the moment you walk in the staff has such a nice air about them. I've been here a few times but I forget to check in, this salon has been my go to spot for my beauty needs the second I discovered it.   D'Lisa has done a Brazilian wax for me (which by the way was QUICK! not as painful as I expected, D'Lisa has an awesome personality and doesn't mind chatting while she does it), and a few eyebrow and lip waxes. After my first visit I decided I would try to have my hair cut and styled here as well, and I chose Vanessa... And I couldn't be happier! She is very sweet like everyone else. She did a great job and this last visit, we decided to make a drastic change. I had very long, thick hair. She suggested a short cut and I love it. I also had my eyebrows and lip recently waxed by Taylor as well and I was incredibly happy with those results too. I always love to come in and relax. They also offer drinks and snacks which I think is nice. Happy one year anniversary to this location!  Overall extremely happy to find this gem of a business with people so kind. Everything has been spectacular!

I wanted to go ahead and do a quick update/edit. After I left this review I also started getting spa manicures with Leticia.. I definitely recommend the "spa" version of anything she does.. Most relaxing massage ever!  She has done vinylux polishes (which last a week) and Gelish for me. Always very satisfied and she is very easy to talk to. She's gone out of her way to reschedule to me and has responded to me late at night if I had chipped the polish and wanted to come in and do something different. It's really sad to say that I have since moved from the Phoenix area, but yea.. Whenever I visit home I need to visit!

OK score from me. I was looking to stay in town for a few days without spending a whole lot, and this place is somewhat ok. I will say I did read a LOT of reviews, so was worried about bed bugs and stuff.   Owner was extremely nice. Let us pick what floor we wanted to stay on.   Felt unsafe due to the area, around the block is a travel stop that has many homeless people.   We never got breakfast here, so no issue.   Room was OK. Some paint was peeling.   Toilet ran ALL the time. The noise was a bit annoying....

Very cute place, owners are super friendly. I do suggest trying the Vanilla Frappe. Was delicious, same with the chocolate chunk cookies! This is right across the street from my workplace and I have been here a few times for coffee. Always very pleasant :)
