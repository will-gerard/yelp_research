Dinosaur is one of my favorite golf courses in Arizona.  The course itself winds through the Superstition foothills, and the elevation changes are spectacular.  The course has always been in the best condition imaginable, and the marshals are always helpful.  The first time I played it, I had the same doubts of other reviewers. The practice area is small,  only has mats, and you can only hit irons and hybrids.  The putting area is small and there are no bunkers or chipping areas nearby.  For those people from the North that haven't golfed during the winter months, it does not really give a person a chance to get their game together - which they will need to do to golf Dinosaur.  But once you get on the course, you forget all of that. The beauty of the site and the wildness is amazing.  I have seen deer, coyotes, cougars, and javelinas on the course, despite houses sprinkling some of the fairways.  A beautiful course, and the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is the practice/warmup area.

Picture this - Mother's Day with 3 toddlers under three and a half. We decided to go to the Railroad park, as the parents group was having a gathering and barbecue there. We thought the children would have a ball, being able to run around and see other children - and be able to eat besides.  Well, I think grandpa had as much fun as the kids - there is so much to do, and so many things for the children to play on.  Yes, I rode the train, played on the stagecoach, chased the twins around the picnic area, and even had a  barbecued hot dog!! They have a large train, and a smaller "steam" train.  The large  train goes around the park, which is fairly big, and you can see all the different groups gathered while on the train. You even get to go through a tunnel.  There is also a railroad museum, birthday cars that you can rent for birthday parties, a swing area for the younger children, the stagecoach and little western town, and a number of gazebos that can be rented for a particular day and time.    All in all, it is a great park for kids of all ages, including those of us that have never quite grown up.

This is not very far from my home, but for some strange reason, I have never visited there.  Maybe because we don't have New York Deli's in Spokane, and I'm not familiar with the idea.  The other day, I agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel, and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop.  They actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu.  I had breakfast - the choices were very diverse - including skillets, various pancakes, bagels (of course), french toast, omelets, and a number of other items.  The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable.  The only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy.  I actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.  Although I usually don't eat lunch, I am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu. And their deli counter, and all the different varieties of bagels.

Let's see - where to start?  Dive bar - check; dirty bathrooms - check; very little parking - check; styrofoam plates - check; not gourmet chinese food - check. So why 5 stars?  It's a combination of wonderful employees and owners, awesome selection of beer, good size drinks, great customers and good but not spectacular food. Yes - it is a dive bar, but it's much more than that, and has a charm all of it's own.  Part of the total effect is that you do not have the typical Scottsdale club crowd, but down to earth people that are there for some inexpensive food and good drinks.  Most of entrees run $6.99 for a pint, which is served with rice in little boxes.  It is enough for one person, and I always have rice left over.  I do like my food spicy, and their spicy is not very hot.  However, they do provide red chili sauce, so you can spice it up to your heart's content.  Is it "gourmet food" - no, but it is delicious.  If I had my choice, I would come here rather than PF Changs - and in fact, this has become my favorite spot in North Scottsdale for beer drinking, eating, and just hanging out.  So I am giving it 5 stars, not just for it's food, but it's overall atmosphere.  For a dive bar, you can't get any better.

This is several miles from  where I live - but there are a number of "tire" shops within a half a mile of me. When I went out to my car after being away for awhile - I had a flat tire. After AAA came out and put my spare on, I went to 3 different tire shops - two who wouldn't even look at it because they "don't repair flats". WTF - a tire store that doesn't repair tires!! The last one I went to suggested  Discount Tire, so off I went, expecting the worse.    What a great surprise!!  They got the tire, looked at it, and showed me where there was a hole in the sidewall, which couldn't be fixed.  So I bought I new tire, it was on the car and out in 30 minutes.  Great service, fast, and really reasonable prices.  Just this month, the wheels and tires were stolen off of my son's Yukon.  I suggested Discount Tires, and they came to the car and replaced them, all within a day. And they had to deal with the insurance, and also special order the wheels and tires.  With that kind of service they are now my tire store!!!

Now, I'm not a country western fan, have never line-danced or danced the 2-step.  But this is a great bar.  I was talked into going by my son, who is a country western fan.  The first time I went there, we just had something to eat, and beer.  The band hadn't started playing, because we were there to early, but the people were nice, and all the staff were really pleasant. We only had hamburgers, so we couldn't really judge the food.  The next time I went, my golfing buddies wanted to try it - so we got there on a Friday night, right before the band started..  Now none of us are country western guys, so we were there just to have a good time. One of the guys wandered off and found a TV, which the staff switched onto a football game he wanted to see. The rest of us sat and watched as the band started playing, and the dancers started dancing.   What a great time!!  Obviously, there was a group of people that were regulars, and came just to dance.  Then there were a lot of people (like us) that just came to watch, drink, and have a good time.  There is a whole range of age groups, and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun, whether they were dancing, drinking or watching.  Out of all the places I took my buddies, this is the one place that they all said they wanted to come back to. And who knows, maybe next time they will bring cowboy hats!!

Bunk beds - have you ever shopped for bunk beds?  Not many stores have them, and the ones they have very utilitarian.  We were fixing up a room for my grandchildren, and bunk beds were what were needed.  So to make a long story short, the only ones we found that fit with the decor, were at Roomstore.  This was about the 10th store we had been to, and since I am not a shopper, I found a comfortable couch to sit on, while my wife did the shopping.  The salesmen were super friendly, and very patient with her (more so than I was).  But I had the couch, and and a few  bored salespeople that came by and visited with me. That kept me entertained, while she happily did the shopping.  Not only did she look at their bunk beds, but every other bit of furniture in the store.  They have a huge selection, and I was provided coffee so I wouldn't fall asleep.  She did find the bunk beds, and was very pleased with them, and I must admit, they look beautiful.  She also found a couch (not the one I was sitting on) and ottoman that she purchased, and they held for us until we were ready to have them delivered.  After they were delivered, my picky wife decided she didn't like the ottoman, and they took it back without question, and immediately credited our account.    It was really difficult scheduling delivery, not because of the, but because of my schedule, They were very accommodating and helpful, even though we had to change the scheduled delivery several times.  All in all, the salespeople and office staff made it a very pleasant experience.

I was wandering around the shopping center at Shea and Scottsdale Road at lunch trying to decide what to eat.  I noticed a little Italian Deli, and was amazed  - it was before noon and the placed was packed.  I went in and before I looked at the menu, I wandered around looking at the diners and their plates.  The diners were very mixed - professionals,  construction workers, couples, singles, and groups. They all seemed to have something different, and they all seemed to be enjoying what they were eating.    So I decided to give it a try.  The person who took my order spoke heavily accented Italian, but I managed to convey what I wanted, which was really simple - an Italian Sub with salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni & Provolone.  It was packed with onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and drenched in sub oil.  It was great, delicious - made me aware of what I had been missing all my life - and more than filled me up.  My only disappointment was that I was full - I wanted to try everything on their menu, because everything looked so tempting.  But they are close to my home, so I'm sure it will become my lunchtime favorite.  I only gave them 4 stars, since I only had the sandwich.  But I will update as I visit them again and try their complete menu, which also includes salads, pasta, pizza, and different kinds of subs.

I am handy around the house - but like most things, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  This Home Depot is close to home, so I frequent it quite often.  It is a typical Home Depot, but what i really like about it is that there are knowledgeable people that work there that will tell me when I am out to lunch.  Sometimes (well most of the times) I need a little direction, and they are always most helpful.  I think on some of the items, their inventory is a little sparse, compared to Lowe's.  But the people seem much friendlier, and much more willing to help.  Even the customers, if I am looking somewhat perplexed, will make suggestions. Can't beat that!!

Stopped by this little bookstore on a rainy day, a good time for reading.  It is located in a strip mall just south of Fry's at 8989 E. Via Linda.  It is not large, but they have used all of the available space for books. They have an extensive collection of used paperbacks, and a few new books available for purchase.  The owner is super friendly, and spent quite a bit of time showing me around, and making sure that I understood the exchange policy.  They have a large selection of used mystery, and general fiction books, quite a few romance novels.  Their science fiction/fantasy section is very small as is their western section,  but overall, they have more books than usual for a small book store.  I am only giving it 4 stars for two reasons - first, the exchange policy is not the best I have run into in small paperback exchange stores, and because they had small selections in several of the genre most people are looking for.  However, I did buy several older titles I had not been able to find in other stores, so it was a very successful visit.  Overall, a nice little store, and the service was great.

My children love Chipotle, and where ever they are it is the first thing they look for.  I had never tried it before, but I have tried similar places, so I knew what to expect when I came in,  It is very clean and spacious, and there is plenty of room to park.  The first time I was there I wanted to read the newspaper, so I ate there, and it was quite pleasant. The next couple of times, I had burritos to go.  I was pleased  all of the times I was there.  As with any of these make-it-while you watch places, I think a lot depends on the people fixing the food.  All of the times I have been here, they have been very pleasant and have not skimped on any of the ingredients.  Compared to other similar business places I have been, the meat, whether it is the beef, chicken or pork, is extra flavorful. In all, a great experience.  In fact, as I write this, I am craving a Chipotle burrito...

I don't eat breakfast often, but when I do, I like it to be large, filling, and cheap.  That being said, I was disappointed in JP for two reasons -  service and value.  Although the pancakes are excellent, the breakfasts are overpriced for what you get.  My bacon was undercooked, but the personable waitress volunteered to take the bacon and have it cooked some more.  Even with that, the service was terrible.   Once she served the customers, she would play cards with the cook. I had to remind her that she took my bacon to be recooked; and also had to ask for a refill on my coffee. I guess the card game was too fascinating!  Although this location is not far from where I live, I doubt I will be going back.

This is one of two Fry's within about half of mile of each other - one on the north side of Mountain View, and the other on the south side.  One is a Fry's Signature Market, and the other is a Fry's Marketplace.  Apparently they were owned by two different companies before Kroger bought them out and turned both of them into Fry's.    I prefer this one simply because it is a little better organized, and has a wider variety of general merchandise.   They have a fairly good selection of wines and alcoholic beverages, although their selection isn't as good as AJ's.  They do have a fair amount of natural and organic items and their vegetables and fruits are very good. They have a nice little deli, with varying priced meats and cheeses. Also, the store doesn't seem as cramped as the other one, and the merchandise doesn't seem to be as crammed into each nook and cranny.  This may be simply a matter of the size of the store, but it does make shopping a lot easier and relaxing.  The clerks are generally pleasant, and helpful, although sometimes a little rushed.  Apparently Fry's is on a cost cutting campaign, and of course, the first thing they cut back on is help. But the workers really make an effort to help the customers, and we appreciate that.  I do go to AJ's for specialty items and their beer and wine selection.  However, for every day shopping, this is the place to go.

Drove a van down from Washington, and had the engine light come on.  By the time I got to Ketchum's it was off, but they hooked the computer up and told me they couldn't be sure but to bring it back if it came on again..  I later went back and it was what they thought it was, and they repaired it.    They were really friendly and attentive.  They were able to get the car in immediately, and would have driven me home if I wouldn't have waited.  It is family run, and not part of a big chain, so they value their reputation, and are proud of the length of time they have been in business.

If you are a nuts and bolts kind of guy, this is the place.  It is rather a small Ace store, but they have almost all of the normal hardware merchandise squeezed into the small space.  Consequently you have to ask where things are - and the people that work there are very helpful.  That is the advantage of small hardware store, next to a Home Depot or Lowe's.  It is the people that make the business, and these employees are great.  I have been here for keys, fans, electrical switches and receptacles, wire, screws, bolts, tools, and always seem to be able to find what I want.  Ace and Home Depot are complementary to each other, as each of them stock things that the other one doesn't.  But I'm lucky, and have both within a mile of my house, and I use them constantly.  And if you want something that they don't have, you can order it on their internet site, and they will ship it to the store.  What more can one want?

I am not a shopper.  So when my daughter needed me to get a  children's "pak n play" for her recent visit, not only did I now know what is was,  I never even knew where to start looking.  Now when I go shopping I usually last about 10 minutes,  so I headed to the PGA Golf Superstore on Shea.  Why?  I figured that since I don't  do shopping very well, the least I could do was to start somewhere I liked.  Across the parking lot I noticed a place called "Kid to Kid" and since I had heard it mentioned by my daughter before, I called her and she said to check it out. Wow - this was even better -  maybe I could take care of everything with one stop, so off I went.  Being a male, and not knowing what I was shopping for, I went up to the first clerk, and asked if they had any "pak and play" things.  She said they might have - it just depended on what they had in stock.  Well, my luck ran out - they didn't have any.  But she said they had another store in Paradise Valley, and I could call them to see if they had any.  I did, and surprise - they had one, which they would hold for me if I could get there in the next hour.  Twenty minutes later I was the proud owner of a "pak n play"  and even found out what it was.  Mission accomplished - and not counting travel time - I was in the stores for less than 10 minutes!!  But while I was in the stores, I did get to look at some of the merchandise.  If you are looking for clean, slightly used, children's clothes and furniture, this is the place to go.  The "pak n play" was brand new (still had the original tags) and was less than half the original price.  Apparently their stock varies so several trips may have to be made - but they have enough merchandise that experienced and savvy shoppers will always find something and at heavily discounted prices.  If you have young children or grandchildren, give them a try.  You will be very pleasantly surprised.

In the State of Washington, all liquor sales are controlled by the State, including state owned liquor stores. I had driven by these little hole-in-the-wall drive-up liquor stores in Arizona, and was curious about them. So one day, instead of walking by the store, I went in to browse around.   Obviously, the store was really meant for drive through customers.  The inside of the store was small, cluttered, and stacked with boxes of bottles, in haphazard displays and in no discernible order.  They did have the high traffic brands, and with some exploring, you could find some of the smaller distillers and distributors.  And they did have a small selection of wines, but nothing like AJ's.  It would have been interesting to really explore, but the aisles were so narrow, that barely one person fit - so if there were more than 3 or 4 people in the store, you were afraid of knocking over a display.  Since it was really crowded, I didn't spend a whole lot of time there. The prices looked comparable to Fry's, but not nearly the selection.    I think I'll stick to Fry's or AJ's, until I can get to BevMo or Total Wine.

I first stopped at this place for a quick bite to eat right after happy hour began.  It was pretty a random choice, since I was in the area, and simply wanted something quick and easy before I headed to Golfsmith.  Since it wasn't busy, I wandered around, and was pleasantly surprised by the place.  The staff was friendly, the patio was nice, and all tables and seats had good views of the TVs.  The menu was extensive, and you could find almost anything you had a taste for.  I had the chicken fingers appetizer with the blackened cajun spice, and they did a first rate job with the seasoning.  Although some places tone down their seasoning, the spice mixture was just right. Although it might be spicy for some tastes, it was just like I cook at home - and very rarely found in a restaurant.  They also had a nice selection of draft beer.  I have since been back several time, and have tried both their pizza and pulled pork.  Both were very well prepared, especially for bar food.  The place was very busy the last two times I was there, but it was very well staffed, and plenty of servers to handle the volume of people.   As has been noted by others, they also have a shuttle bus, which is a definite plus. It will pick you up and take you home.   I have never used it, but I have talked with others that have, and they all love it.  It is great that the restaurant has that option available.

A great Brewpub!!  It is about half way between two of my favorite golf stores, so thankfully it  is very convenient for me.  They also have two of my favorite beers - Kilt Lifter and Oatmeal Stout. Consequently, I am here on a regular basis.  I have stopped by at all times of the day - lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  I have to confess, I very seldom eat here - not because the food is bad - but simply because I am usually on my way one place or another.  What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.  What stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.    Although it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve.   Be aware - it can get busy, particularly at night and during popular games. If you don't like crowds, or just want quiet conversation and drinking, it can be overwhelming.

We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.  Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.    The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance.  Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...  I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.  The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).  Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.  I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it.

This is a course I keep coming back to time and time again.  I bought their OB Golf Club and have golfed most of their courses, and this is my favorite.  I bring my friends here when they visit, because with the OB card, they also get discounted rates.  And universally, after I ask them at the end of their visit, which of the OB courses they liked the best, it is Eagle Mountain.  Every time I have played, the condition of the course was immaculate. The advantage of this course, over the We-Ko-Pa courses, is that the carries aren't as bad, and seems to be more forgiving.  It is surrounded by homes, but they are back enough that they do not come into play.  Finally the staff was friendly, and helpful.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that it took a long time to play.  Every time I have played it has been "cart path" only, which really adds to the time it takes to play (especially if you are in the opposite rough).  I highly recommend it to everyone, and it should be everyone's list of courses to play.

I was late for golf this morning, so I wasn't able to grab anything for breakfast.  Heading to We-Ko-Pa I was going through the culinary desert of Fountain Hills, so I thought I would look for a breakfast place.  A church had just let out (yes, on a Wednesday morning) , so I decided that I would follow the church members.  It was a good idea, and a bad idea.   The good part was that they led me to DJ Bagels.  The bad part was that with all the church members, it was crowded.  It was mostly an older crowd, so being old, but fast, I darted to the front of the line and ordered their special breakfast sandwich, which was the first thing on their blackboard.  And was it ever good!!  It had bacon, ham, egg, sausage, your choice of cheese, and your choice of bagel.  All for $4.99.  What a great breakfast sandwich.  As I waited for the sandwich, I took some time to look at their full menu, and watch the servers take the orders to the customers.  The service was great - and the servers seemed to know a lot of their customers.  And even with the crowd, they always seemed to match up the order with the right person.  And their menu was enticing, a lot of natural choices, and really interesting combinations.  From now on, when I golf in Fountain Hills, I know where to go for a quick breakfast.

I flew in from Washington, went to my house, and headed to the golf course.  Unfortunately my van wouldn't start.   How could this be?  My son had just purchased a battery for the van from AAA several weeks before, so I called AAA and they had someone out in 10 minutes.  He checked the battery, and the charging system, and everything seemed all right.  He then checked the battery again, and found that there was a dead cell.  He replaced the battery with no questions asked, and apologized for the dead battery.  He was very professional throughout, and definitely knew what he was doing.    And I did get to the golf course in time.  What more could you ask!!  Five stars definitely.

I decided to take advantage of the low summer golf rates in the valley, and try Las Sendas Golf Club. Several golfers that I had played with on other courses suggested I try it.  When I arrived, it was evident that there was construction of a new pro shop, and I had to wander around until I found the temporary pro shop in a trailer. Not being deterred by the immediate construction area, I was anticipating the round from everything I had heard about the course.  The golf course is great.  They have a very nice driving range and practice area, and it is included in the price of the round.  I was favorably impressed, as the range was in great shape, the yardage was provided to the flags, and the hitting area was level. Plus, because it wasn't busy, I could spend as much time on the range as I wanted, before I played.  The fairways are in excellent condition, and the greens were true.  There are houses along the golf course, but they are set back enough that you do not have to worry about hitting them with errant shots.  Several of the holes are fairly straightforward, but most are outstanding.  Some I consider  the most picturesque in the area, and because of the elevation, many holes have wonderful views of the valley.  Apparently they have new owners/management, and they are really working at making the club a first class experience.  I was favorably impressed, and am adding this to my list of favorite courses in the valley.

Across the street from a Taco Bell - but so much better.  Located just south of Old Town on Thomas, to the West of Scottsdale Road, it is located in a small building on the North side of the street.  Depending on sensibilities, one may or may not want to eat in - it is a pretty basic interior with a few tables - some would even call it a greasy spoon.  However, the food is great - if you like authentic south of the border fare.  There is a large menu painted on the wall, with pictures of the food and descriptions .  You can get combinations, or individual orders of tacos, burritos, etc. It is inexpensive -  I had two carne asado tacos and a fountain drink for less than $5.00.  The hot sauce and condiments are great, and the people are friendly.  Great little place for a quick bite to eat for breakfast, lunch or late night.

I was in Old Town for an appointment and walked by Bischoff's. I remembered that I wanted to check them out to see if they had a particular hot sauce.  I had only been in one other time several years ago, and had forgotten what a unique store it was.  Because I had some time to kill, I not only looked at the hot sauces, but also all their other "stuff".  And what stuff it is - everything from southwestern  foods, baskets, pottery, clothes, t-shirts, travel books, cookbooks, hats, tourist souvenirs - you name it, they have it.    It kind of reminds me of the old general stores that still exist in small towns - a little of everything, but with a southwest flavor.  Crowded, narrow aisles, no rhyme or reason where they stock things - but still fun to look through.  I never did find the particular hot sauce I was looking for, but I did manage to find three others that I took home to try. And I'll be back, if for nothing else  just to look through their assorted merchandise for that elusive  touristy gift.

My first experience with the "Bat Cave" was an evening rendezvous with a friend of mine to watch a basketball game on TV.  It was a late night game, and to be perfectly frank, I don't remember who won - actually I don't remember much of the night at all.  It turns out that they had late night specials for food service workers, and we made the most of it.  But I do remember that it was a fun night, and after looking at the menu, I wanted to try some of their food.  One of the things that intrigued me was that most of the dishes had green chili's - either in the sauce or the actual dish.  Since I love chili's of all sorts, and had never really sampled authentic "New Mexican" food, I was looking forward to it.  I tried the green chili stew, the Carne Adovado and  loved them.  Since then I have tried almost all of their menu items, and haven't found one that disappoints me, although I keep coming back to the Carne Adovada.    The service has always been great - my beer never gets empty before another is brought - a really important consideration if you are eating the habanero sauce.  As has previously been described, the decor is a little different, and the bat theme a little over the top.  But it all comes together, and is a fun place especially later in the evening.  And the food is always good.

My golf group decided to take me out to dinner as a reward for having them down to Scottsdale for our winter golf trip.  One of the guys wanted to go to Don and Charlie's so that's where we ended up. We got there fairly early on a Friday night, and were able to get right in.  We were seated in a large booth and given menu's but then seemed to lose our waitress.  It was busy at the time, so we weren't upset, but we wanted to order drinks.  We finally flagged the woman that sat us, and she located a server that took our order.  She then brought us our drinks, but was so busy with other tables, that she seemed to forget us for a while.   Apparently they had a special on their prime rib that ended at 6:00 pm, and everyone wanted to order before the magic hour was reached.  But so did we - and she made it just in time. But was she ever frazzled and curt.  The prime rib was wonderful, the baked potato was delicious, and the drinks were great.  I don't eat red meat that often, but I love it, and the prime rib and steaks were cooked just right - and the fresh horseradish was an extra treat.   It should be noted that by the time we finished there was a line waiting to get in.  They were swamped, but they did not seem in any hurry to rush us out and free up our table.  As sports fans, we all wandered around looking at the sports memorabilia during the time we were eating, so it took us a little longer to finish than usual.  They were patient and we did not feel rushed at all.  The only thing that detracted from the experience was the general commotion and noise of the crowd, and people waiting to get in.  It made it difficult to talk, so of course, we raised our voices.  And that just added to the din.  But all in all, it was a great experience.

Was looking for someone to work on my vehicle (a check engine light had appeared) and I had become somewhat disgruntled with my old service center. After looking on Yelp reviews, I decided to call Marshall's. They were able to get it in the next day to see what the problem was.  Very nice on the telephone, and they called me back to give me various options and prices on repairs. I decided to just replace the spark plug wires, and when I picked it up, it ran perfectly.  What impressed me was they gave me choices on what needed fixing immediately, and what could wait until later.  Some of the things that needed to be done, I could do myself which saved  money, which is always a good thing.   Very nice people, and very professional. They are my new auto service mechanics, as I can trust them to give me honest answers.

On my way home from a late golf session at McCormick Ranch, I decided to stop at the Village Tavern. I had driven by it for years, but never stopped in to see what they offered. I wanted to try some place different, so decided to give it a go.  Since I was by myself, I immediately went to the bar for liquid refreshment. Not a great selection of beer, but they did have several choices, so all was not lost.  I did decide to try something to eat, but since I wasn't overly hungry, I opted for a pizza. I was surprised - it was quite good for a "bar" pizza, and something I would order again. On a subsequent visit I had the fish tacos, which were also quite good.  I'm not a meat and potatoes person, but there were a number of choices on the menu that I am waiting to try.  However, it always seems that when I stop by, I'm more in a snacking mood than looking for a full dinner. But their menu is solid, and I will try a full meal when the mood hits.  A nice place, and I wouldn't hesitate to bring out of town visitors here.

As if I didn't have enough hiking in the desert,  I decided to golf Sanctuary.  Unfortunately I picked a rainy, windy, cold day to do so.  Why "unfortunately"?  Because Sanctuary is a narrow desert course - and we looked like drowned rats after the first two holes.  So we decided to sit in the lounge a have a few drinks until it stopped raining.  It turned out to be over two hours.  Consequently, we spent a lot of time on the next 16 holes looking for balls.  I blame it on being cold - the alcohol couldn't have had anything to do with it!!  But all in all, a very nice course.  It is target golf, and at times from the tee boxes, the fairway is hidden.  Warning - if a person isn't driving well, then bring lots of balls.  The desert here is very rocky - so if your ball goes off the fairway, you have no idea which direction to look.    They do have a nice practice area.  It includes a putting area, driving range, and bunker/chipping area.    The people working there are very nice, and offered to give us rain checks since we had only played two holes.  We did persevere, and finished all eighteen.  But only with help from the grill - the beverages and food was above average for a golf course, so we did enjoy the rain delay.  I would highly recommend this course - it is nearby, a desert target course,  environmentally  conscious,  and fun to play.  Just bring lots of balls, and watch out for rattlesnakes.

I just wonder why it took me so long to find this place.  I vaguely remember looking for it one day, and never finding it.  I thought maybe I had the wrong address, my iPhone was lost, or it was to late at night after an evening of looking for the perfect drinking hole.  So I tried it several months later in the early evening, and finally found it after driving by it three times.  But it was well worth the search.  I found beer heaven!!  They not only have a record number of beers on tap, they also have hundreds of beers located in large glass faced coolers so you can browse at your leisure.  More importantly you can pick and choose what beer you want and buy it in six packs to go.    They have a large menu, which looked very good - something for everyone.  Unfortunately I was so enthralled by all the different beers, that I forgot to eat.  But from the looks of the food delivered to the people around me, it was very appetizing, and all the people seemed to enjoy it.  It is a very comfortable place - lots of wood beams, interesting decorations, and very friendly staff.  The place is really laid back, and  very easy going, although it does get loud at times.  It only adds to the atmosphere, which of course is very conducive to drinking.  I am only giving this 4 stars, because I have yet to have the food.  But I will be back to try it, and, of course, to continue sampling the ever  changing variety of beers.

Being from the Northwest, I'm always on the look out for a good coffee place.  No, not the wild exotic mixed coffee concoctions, but just your basic strong coffee that tastes like it was brewed in an old enamel pot on a camp stove.  Although most of the corporate coffee shops have their "bold" coffees, they just don't do it.  And throw in some bagels, muffins, pastries and reading material, and I'm good. So I stopped by here with some friends the other day, and was pleasantly surprised.  They do their own roasting and grindings, and have really good flavorful coffee.  They also have pastries, muffins, and minimal  sandwiches.  It is nicely decorated with a few really comfortable chairs on the inside with counter seating and tables.  There is also outside seating that is really pleasant on those warm Arizona mornings.  A plus is that they have free WiFi, and newspapers and magazines for comfortably relaxing over that morning cup of coffee.  Surprisingly, although  I have been back several times, I haven't tried any of their food or pastries. To me, it is all about the coffee, and great doses of caffeine.  For that, they get four stars.  They have the best tasting coffee I have found in the Phoenix area, and although they don't always have their strongest available, I can always find one that I like.  It has now become my morning hangout.

What can you say about this place? I was in the area, in the middle of the day, and thirsty. I had never heard of the Tilted Kilt before, so I thought - an Irish pub!! All right!! I went in - and things were looking great - nice interior, lots of big screen TV's, and good looking waitresses (I'm a guy - I like looking at good looking scantily clad women).  But it went downhill fast. I wandered over to the bar, sat down, and waited. Did I mention I was thirsty?  It took a good 5 minutes for the bartender to even notice I was there - she was busy talking to other customers on the outside bar.  She finally noticed me, and handed me a menu and took my drink order. Never said a word!!  She then went back to her conversation with the others.   While she was socializing, I did look at the menu, and the food people were eating, and nothing really looked or sounded appetizing. Twenty minutes later, she came back, and sharply asked me if I wanted to order. By that time, I just wanted another beer before I left. She grumpily took the menu, and went back to talking to the guys on the outside bar.  I did notice that out of about 20 people in the restaurant, all were men.  Obviously, they were there to look at the waitresses, and not for the service or food. But all were sitting at the bar or outside patio - maybe the secret is to sit at a table.  BTW - the bartender never came back.  She was so engrossed in her conversation on the other side of the bar, I could have walked out without paying and she never would have noticed.  I did leave cash for the drinks - but no tip.    So if you want to dine and dash - this might be the place. But otherwise, don't bother.

I was told about this place as the unofficial home for the Seahawks (aka as the SeaChickens) in this area.  Seattle was playing a Thursday night game, so a group of fans and I decided to go there and give it a go. It is a Irish style pub tucked into a corner in a strip mall.  Although I had been in the mall a number of times visiting Golfsmiths, Best Buy, and Northern Lights, I had no inkling this place was even there. We got there early, jut in time for Happy Hour, and it was great. Half price off of all appetizers and flatbreads, and $2.00 off all beers and wine. In addition, they have great daily specials.  It has quite a gathering for Seahawk games, and it can be pretty noisy and wild during the games.  However, I did return on a Monday night to try their $5.00 hamburger (a great bargain), and although it was busy, it was a very friendly and easy going atmosphere.  With their daily specials, great happy hour, and friendly atmosphere, this could become one of my favorite places.

I'd heard about Jason's Deli for a while, and never had a chance to try it.  I was in the vicinity though, and finally took the time to stop in for lunch.  It was right at high noon, and I never expected the number of people that were coming and going. That said, it was very efficient - everyone knew what they were doing, and they handled the crowd very smoothly.  As this was my first time through, and not having looked at a menu before hand, I was overwhelmed by the number of choices.  I ordered a basic sub, found a seat, and waited for it to be brought to my table.  There wasn't a long wait, and despite the size and bustle of the place, the order was promptly brought to my table. The sandwich was great, reasonably priced, and filling.  I was amazed at the number of people that they were able to serve, without it ever seeming to be as busy as it was. Next time, I will go when it is not quite as crowded, so I can study the menu, and try some other menu choices - especially their soup, gumbo, and red beans and rice.    And yes, there is soft ice cream, so that alone will keep me coming back.

Finally!!  After three separate tries,  I made it to the Vermont Sandwich Company when they were open.  I had to meet the carpet cleaner at 1:00 pm and was starving.  So I stopped, and they were actually open.  It isn't that they don't keep regular hours - it just seems I always get hungry for a sandwich at weird times.  I had the whole Long Trail sandwich - roast beef, horseradish mayo, muenster cheese, extra onions,  green peppers, crumbled bacon, and a delicious pickle.  Also a side order of potato salad.  The service was quick, and the person taking the order was very helpful.  There is plenty of sandwich - in fact, I had some left to eat for a late snack.  The VSC has a wide variety of hot and cold sandwiches, wraps,  and salads.  They make the sandwiches out of fresh ingredients, and actually cook their own beef for the sandwiches.  An interesting concept is you can build your own sandwich - something like a pizza.  But I want to try a few more of their combinations before I experiment.  One thing I did find - if you aren't hungry when you go in, you will be after you look for a while.  The aroma of beef, bacon, and condiments is enough to make your stomach growl.  One of the best sandwich places in Scottsdale.  I'll be back - I even have a menu with the hours listed.

I love golf stores.  I never buy very much, but I really enjoy browsing and looking at all the golf related  merchandise.  This store is kind of hard to get to at first, but well worth the effort once you find it..  Although not as big as some of it's competitors, it has a great selection of clubs, golf clothes, and accessories.  It has an area you can try out clubs, and also a repair center.  The customer service is great, and there is always someone to help with questions.    They seem to have a wider selection of used clubs and older models at fairly reasonable prices than other stores in the area.  It might just be that it is seasonal, but every time I am there I find used and older clubs that are either on sale, or priced very reasonably. Plus, they have Titleist and Footjoy products.  Great place to shop - I always find myself stopping there on my golf store outings and checking out their new additions.

There we were in Sister's Closet, my wife shopping, and me squirming in one of the "man" chairs.  She could tell I was thinking of heading for some chips, salsa and beer at one the of the local eateries, so she took me by the hand to Well Suited, the male equivalent of Sisters.  Then,  of course, off she went back to Sisters.  Not being a shopper, I was lost.  Well Suited isn't as large as Sisters, nor does it have as a large selection, but there seemed to a little something of everything.  After walking around the store, alone and in a daze, I got side tracked and went through a open archway to the furniture end of Sisters - which I  found more interesting.  After browsing through the home furnishings, I went back to Well Suited, and actually looked at the merchandise.  I am not a shopper - but I do know golf shirts, and they had a number of brand name golf shirts at very discounted prices.  A lot of Tommy Bahama, higher end Nike, Bobby Jones, and Greg Norman shirts in different sizes and colors.  I can make decisions on those ( yes, she lets me make my own choices of golf shirts  - she says it doesn't embarrass her - because she doesn't go with me when I golf). But she makes suggestions on my other clothes.   When she came back from Sisters, she showed me other clothing I had missed - high end slacks, suits, shirts, and jackets.  By then, my biologic shopping clock had reached the alarm level - I just couldn't shop anymore.  But I did walk out with two shirts, and a desire to come back next time and shop for my at least my maximum of  twenty minutes!!

This is convenient to where I live, so I stop here often on the way home from McCormick Ranch Golf Course.  It is a classic bar and grill, with dark wood, nice bar, and a lovely outside eating area. It is decorated with blue and white check table cloths, and a very pleasant decor. The food is a step above a typical bar-grill, with a wide variety of choices.   My favorite so far is the Bourbon Street Pasta, which has andouille sausage, cajun seasoned chicken,  and sun dried tomatoes in a chipotle cream sauce.    Of course, they have a wide selection of beer and wine.  The staff is friendly and service is great. I find myself returning every time I am in town.

I noticed Andreoli's, and actually went by it many times on my way to and from different businesses in the Fry's center. But for some reason, I had never gone inside.  Since I live nearby, I try to explore all the interesting eating places in immediate vicinity, and one day I decided I was hungry for an Italian sub.  Since I was near Andreoli's I decided to give it a try (plus the Vermont Sandwich Company was closed).    Entering the deli, it was very nice inside - very comfortable looking and small, with a few tables. Since I was looking for a sandwich to go, I looked at the menus on the reader board/white board and ordered.  The sandwich came in a to-go box, with a side of salad. There was no one else in waiting, and it took several minutes for someone to notice me - but that was ok since I had a chance to go over the menu. The person that took my order was very informative and nice.  When I received the sandwich, I was initially disappointed, since it seemed small for the price, and as always, I was hungry.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived home, and had a chance to taste it.  It was very good - the bread was perfectly cooked, and the meat and cheese were very complimentary.   I have gone back several times and  tried different sandwiches and pastas, and everything I have had is delicious. So if I am really hungry, I will go to other places in the area. But if I am craving authentic Italian food, and am out for a walk, I go to Andreoli's.

New York Pizza? Although I have eaten pizza all my life, I had no idea what New York style pizza was or how it was defined.  But I was watching Sunday night football,  was hungry for a pizza.  I decided to give Yo Pauly's a try, since it was not to far away.  During halftime, I drove over to look at the menu, and order a pizza.  The owner was there, and was quite helpful in my ordering. After I ordered, I was sitting reading the menu (which really extensive - calzones, salads, sandwiches, wings, dinners, desserts and Greek food).  The owner came over and offered his suggestions of menu items to try in the future.  I did not know what to expect.  I took the pizza home, without looking at it, because I was in a hurry to watch the game. Wow!!  I loved it - thin crust, delicious toppings, and baked to perfection.  I normally eat half a pizza, and save some for the following day to see how it reheats.  However, I liked this one so much that I ate the whole thing before the game was over.  Is it New York style pizza? I have no idea - but I do know I liked it, and will be back and try other things on the extensive menu.  Great food, great owner!!

Coming from a place and age where the most exotic ethnic food was considered to be Taco Time, I have spent  many years experimenting with all kinds of different foods.  One of my favorites is Indian food, and thanks to Microsoft and other tech companies, who use workers from India,  there are many more Indian restaurants now scattered throughout the country.  I am not an expert on the food (in fact, until recently, I never understood why Bollywood movies were always playing in Indian restaurants).  But I do enjoy it, and try every Indian restaurant I can find.  I started going to Indian Paradise several years ago, and loved it.  It has a nice interior, and the servers are very nice and helpful.  I always seem to come in the early evening, before they are busy, and I always feel somewhat spoiled the way they treat me.  I love their masalas, curry, and naan, and have, of course, tried all of their Indian beers. I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious.  I might note that I have never made it to the lunch buffet - I always seem to be golfing at that time so I'm just never in the area .  But it is on my list of things to do.  ***Bollywood - Bollywood is the name given to the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry in India.The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood. Bollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number. Indian audiences expect full value for their money; they want songs and dances, love interest, comedy and dare-devil thrills, all mixed up in a three hour long extravaganza with intermission.

Greatest invention in the world - an automatic car wash, that is automatic.  For $5.00.  All you do is drive up to a electronic screen, pick the wash you want, and extras (if any).  No high pressure sales jobs - just high pressure washing.  You have the option of paying by cash or credit card right at the electronic screen.  You drive around the corner - a worker sprays the front of your car with bug cleaner, and off you go through the car wash.  Quick, fast, efficient,  and no hassles.  In addition, they do have vacuums for free for the interior of the car.    How did it do?  Great - I hadn't washed the exterior of the van for a year and the only thing it missed was a couple of embedded bugs on the front.  No more having to avoid washing it because of the hassles that go on at a lot of car washes - now even my daughter will take the van for its weekly bath.

So I played golf,  worked out for two hours, and practiced two hours on my lousy sand play.  After burning thousands of calories, and getting nowhere on my sand shots, I figured I owed myself a treat.  So I stopped by Sweet Republic on my way home, and tasted almost every ice cream they had - and they were all delicious.  I finally settled on their Salted Butter Caramel Swirl, and  loved it.  Always health conscious, I limited myself to two scoops.  But I am now at home calculating how many calories I will have to burn off to justify another trip to Sweet Republic. And this time to go for three or more scoops!!

I've been trying to get to this place for almost a year now.  It is in a general area that I go to at least once or twice a week - Costco, K. O'Donnells, Golfsmith, Four Peaks, etc.  but it seems that I just am never around there when I want a light lunch or quick bite to eat. I finally made it!!  It is a delightful little restaurant located in the strip mall behind K. O'Donnells and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. It reminds me of a taco stand in a building.  The first time I was there, I made it for lunch - and I could see why it has so many good reviews. The line was out the front door, but they simply take your order and you find a table to wait until it is done.  Although it was crowded, I did find a table, and was able to watch as they served lunch - very efficient, very friendly.   The food is delicious, made with fresh ingredients while you wait.  The menu is large.  I have tried the blackened chicken burrito, carne asada tacos, blackened chicken quesadillas, and, of course, the Dos Equis - all were great.  They also have a breakfast menu, and children's menu.  They have several salsas available, but once I found out they had Habanero salsa, I knew I loved this place.  For those that like less fire, they do have both green and red salsa, of varying hotness.     I have only given 4 stars as I haven't tried everything I want to.  So now I will work through their menu - it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. But with Dos Equis, I will persevere.

Being a stranger to town, it took a while to find it, but well worth the search.  I was hungry for cajun food and thought I would give it a try, and am glad I did.  I tried both the gumbo and jambalaya and both were excellent.  I sat at the bar, and the service was friendly and attentive. Although it is a long drive, I will be going back as soon as I have another craving for cajun food.

I am a golfer, so when trying to decide where to have a second home, first and foremost I considered golf courses. But as I explored different cities, I came back to the realization that I wasn't going to be golfing every minute of every day, so I had to consider other activities. Arts and culture, sports teams, zoos, gardens, restaurants and yes, exercise.  Visiting Scottsdale, as one of the potential cities, I became enthralled with the green belt, and its possibilities.    As a result, I bought a place directly on the green belt.  And it was the best decision I could have made. I use it on a daily basis, whether for walking, biking, spending time on it with visiting families and their children, and yes, even practicing golfing (using plastic balls). I also get to play with the dogs that are visiting the green belt with their owners, without the bother of owning one. It is a great place to take small children for a stroll, or to help them learn to ride their bikes and their scooters, to hit and catch balls, or generally just to play.   It is also great place to sit, have coffee or a cool drink, and people watch - and uniformly, most of the people are friendly.   Yes, there are some that take their activities a little to seriously, and are offended by little ones, dogs and distractions being in their way. But for the most part, they pay attention, and handle the inconvenience nicely or at least without saying anything rude.  Now, when people come to visit, the thing they like best about Scottsdale is the green belt and all of the different activities it provides.  It is something the City can be proud of.

I am a golfer - but not a good one.  One of the unintended consequences of my golfing in Arizona is I spend much of my time in the desert chasing balls.  So I thought it would be a good idea to become more familiar with my surroundings - and the McDowell Sonoran Preserve was perfect for that.  We went to the Gateway trail head, simply because it was the easiest to get to, and we lucked out.  It has a very nice visitor center with restrooms, ample parking, and brochures on the various trails. It also has an interpretative trail with signs, information boards, and examples of desert flora and fauna. This trail is paved  and easy to traverse, and I would recommend it for those people that want to see and learn about the desert, but have difficulty walking.  There are a number of other trails throughout the Preserve varying in difficulty and elevation change, so a person has a number of different choices of hiking trails.  One can even hike to the top of the mountain. But one of the things I like best about the preserve is that there are a number of trails that children would enjoy and would not be to difficult for them to hike.  I understand this is part of the City of Scottsdale's Park Department, and we should be proud of the preserve.  Since our original visit to Gateway, we have tried a number of different trails and trail heads, and have enjoyed them all.  Be sure to take your camera, and be careful not to brush up against any of the cacti. My wife accidentally stepped on some when she was taking pictures, and I had to use pliers to pull the barbs out of the soles of her boots.  It's a beautiful area, and the residents of the valley are very lucky to have free access to trails of this caliber. We should all take advantage of it, whether to hike, bike, or simply stroll though the desert scenery. It's beautiful !!!

Came back to Scottsdale for this month's stay, and found water in the bottom of my refrigerator. After checking with friends, who had no recommendations for a service company, I went to Yelp, and found Dino's.  Gave them a call and they set up a time for the next day.  The next morning, the technician called me and confirmed, and gave me a two hour window when he would be there.    He showed up on time, and immediately went to work.  I had an idea what was wrong, but being the klutz that I am, I had no idea how to fix it.  So I made a point to watch him and he had no objection - and explained what he was doing as he went along..  He was quite personable, and obviously knew what he was doing. Withing a half hour it was fixed, and working.   The price was reasonable, especially when you consider he educated me on how to fix it if it ever happens again.  So Dino's is now my appliance repair company.

I had no idea what AJ's Food was, but had a chance to browse through it the other day.  Very impressive.  This is not a place that you would use to do your daily shopping.  But it is fantastic for those items that are hard to find.  The deli is unlike any deli I have ever seen in a grocery store.  The food that they have is not your typical deli food.  There were various dips, spreads, salads, and meats.  I sampled the rice pudding and a cajun shrimp cracker spread.  Both were delicious.  And their baked items and desserts were out of this world.  I was equally impressed with the large beer selection they had - everything from Chinese to Indian to Mexican  beer - brews from all over the world. And their domestic beer selection is second to none.  If you are looking for a particular brand, they can order it for you.  The wine selection was equally large, and offered all the selections one could want.  Their produce selection, and general grocery section offered a variety of items not normally stocked in a grocery store.  I was on a tight time schedule, so I wasn't able to browse as much as I wanted.  The prices are higher than a normal grocery, but for those items that you have a hard time finding stocked in your local store, this is the place.  From now on, I will visit AJ's on a weekly basis, but just for those one-of-a-kind items (plus the bakery goods).

I had to check out the iPhone 4, so  went to the Apple Store,  Now I am not a Mac guy - all of my laptops and PC's are Windows, even though I have an iPhone.  So it was really interesting going into the store.  Between their laptops, iPhones, and iPads, I was impressed.  More importantly, they seem to have customer service - which cannot be said of Microsoft.    On entering the store, there is a greeter, that kind of steers you in the right direction.  After browsing their hardware, I wandered over  the Genius sections, where technicians helped people with their problems.  Now granted, Apple has it easy since they do limit their OS to their own hardware - the technicians do not have to know the ins and outs of all the different computers or their incompatibilities - they just have to deal with hardware and software they are familiar with.  But they did appear knowledgeable, and did have very good social skills in dealing with people. Not only that, if it was something that was easily solved, there was no charge.  It was refreshing.  There was no high pressure sales persons, just staff that were proud of their products, and eager to show them off.    Now I have to go to the Microsoft store and see how it compares!!

I had an accident with my new iPhone 4 (it decided to take a bath) and after drying it for two days, it was completely dead. I had only had it for two weeks, so I decided to bite the bullet, and buy a new one.  I set up a genius appointment at the Apple Store, and went in expecting to be out some serious cash.  I was up front about the water damage with my assigned technician, and she was quite helpful - in fact, after checking my account, and seeing that I had been a long time iPhone user, and had just upgraded, she managed to get me a new iPhone at no charge.  Thanks to the Apple Store and thanks to Madison. Great customer service!!

We were in North Scottsdale taking photographs of the desert, and ended up close to the Calistro Bistro.  So after all the glowing reviews, we decided to stop in for Happy Hour on a Sunday and give it a try.  Wow, were we impressed.  We were the only ones in the place (except for a bridal shower in the back room), and were asked where we would like to sit.  Being chilled from being outside in the rain, we opted to sit at the seating area where you could view the chef's working, and directly in front of the cooking fire.    We were offered drinks, and since my designated driver doesn't drink, was given a choice of a number of teas.  The one she selected was fabulous (according to her).  I saw that they had Anchor Steam Porter on tap, and I was in heaven,    They have a wide choice of  appetizers on their happy hour menu, and we tried several of them - the pork taco, the fish taco, the flatbread, and the short-rib Panini sliders.  All were delicious.  They were all so appetizing, we couldn't pick a favorite between the fish (salmon) taco, the pork taco, and the flatbread.  The meat in the sliders was fantastic, but the toasted panini  was slightly over browned.  I might add that the waitress originally brought us an order of hummus that someone else ordered, and it looked so good, that I thought my wife was going to arm wrestle her  for  it.  She said that the next time we were there, that was going to be one of her choices.  I do not give many places 5 stars, but I will on Calistro.  There were so many pluses - allowing us to sit where we wanted (I was impressed that the even allowed us in the way we were dressed), Anchor Steam Porter on tap, delicious food, interesting flavors, lovely décor, and wonderful servers.  All in all, a delightful experience on a cold, windy, rainy day.

Sorry - this is my first one star review.  I very seldom do not find something I like about a place - but the only thing I could find I liked at this place was a Dos-Equis Amber draft.    I had a two hour wait until my plane was schedule to depart, and decided to have a beer and watch one of the baseball playoff games.  I really didn't expect much - I had already eaten, and simply wanted to kill time for a couple of hours.   Service - No stars!! The bartender was surly, not just to me but to all of his customers.  I never saw him smile, talk, or express any emotion other than slapping drinks in front of his customers, and acting like he was angry at the world.  Food - No stars!! The people next to me ordered nachos, chips, and some kind of chicken dish.  They were served with plastic cups of hot sauce, guacamole, and in plastic baskets. The food appearance was unappetizing, and ridiculous for the price.  How do I know they were bad? The people left the food uneaten after several tastes, and went next door to another eatery.   Beer - One star!!  You can't ruin Dos Equis, so I will give them one star. If I could take that one away, I would - just for the surliness of the bartender.  So if you are going to stop here before your plane takes off - do not sit at the bar, and do not order food. You may be lucky and get a friendly waitress - but there were none in sight when I was there.

I was in the mall, killing time as usual, and decided to take a look at the Microsoft Store.  I have worked with Microsoft computers since the advent of the computer age, and had recently visited the Apple Store, so I was curious what the Redmond people had to offer.    Next to the Apple Store, it left a lot to be desired.  It was pretty much the same that you could see at any large electronic store - and since Microsoft is primarily a software company, the computers were a mixture of Dell, Toshiba, HP, etc.   There were several interesting displays set up, but I found nothing that was really outstanding or different than you could find at Best Buy or any large computer store.    Even though all of my computers are windows based, I will not be returning any time soon.  There was just nothing that was really new or innovative.

I like it, I really like it!!!  I am a very simple eater, I like good food, and want it to be reasonably priced.  I do not like pretentious restaurants, which are "in" for a couple of months, and then change after the initial reviews. That said, when a good friend wanted to try FNB, I was good to go - but in my mind I was somewhat hesitant, wondering if it was one of those places that had a rush of good reviews, then service, ambiance and quality would slide.  I need not have worried.  I was impressed. After walking by the front  door,  Pavl was standing in the door and greeted us. I had never met him before, but he is one of those genuinely nice, warm human beings that love the world, and everyone in it. I did not have a reservation, but he immediately sat us and truly made us welcome.  It was like dining in some one's home - everyone made us feel at home, and actually seemed concerned about our evening and the meal.  I had the Alaskan Halibut and it was outstanding.  I also tried the Jadori chicken, and it too was wonderful (I had not ordered it - it was half a chicken, and I would have ended up with it in my lap). Of course,  I am a beer drinker, and their choices were limited, which I had expected - but they did have a beer brewed in Prescott, which was fine.  They are known for their wines, and they had an extensive wine list of different local wines available, which I understand are quite good.  It is rather expensive, but the atmosphere, food, and service make it reasonable.  And yes, even if you don't know him before you go in, Pavl will seem like an old friend by the time you leave.

I had always been curious about Mabel's on Main. A lot of different reviews, although they were generally positive.  So the last time I was in the immediate area, I decided to stop in, and of course, have my usual beer.  It was early evening, so it wasn't crowded, and we got right in.   The inside is very nice - a very comfortable feeling, dim lights, and dark wood. There were some tables with stuffed chairs, and booths along the wall, with the bar in the middle of the space. There didn't seem to be anyone to seat us, so we just sat at one of the tables.  Several minutes later, the hostess appeared and informed us that the table was reserved - but it wasn't for several hours, and since we were only going to have a drink, that there was no problem.  The menu was not extensive, but offered a number of different choices.  We decided to have a drink, and just relax for a while. Midway through our drinks, the hostess again appeared, and apparently the party that had reserved the table came early, and we were asked to move to a booth.  This wasn't a problem, and we agreed.  The hostess was very nice and professional, and comped us our first round.    As Mabel's started filling up, I could tell it was more of a lounge than a restaurant. The customers were very diverse, of all ages, and although there was the usual Scottsdale players, it was a very laid back atmosphere.  Great for people watching.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable evening. The hostess and our server were exceptional - very friendly and they alone would keep me coming back.  Great atmosphere, great food, and great service.

Some of my golfing buddies were visiting, and we were heading for We-Ko-Pa for a day of golfing.  It was an early tee time, so we decided to stop in Fountain Hills for breakfast. Since we are always trying to find a good breakfast, and aren't afraid to try new places, we decided to stop at Flapjacks. It is located in the Basha's shopping area, and not to difficult to find.   Now we are all big breakfast people.  We like big country style  breakfasts - which we hope will get us through to Happy Hour time. Their menu was interesting, had a number of different choices, and we all ordered something different.  One of our group is a picky eater - actually he is a pain in the a**.  But the waitress was very nice and accommodating, and the food actually came as he had ordered it.    That said, we were all slightly disappointed.  The servings were small and the food was average. The two pancakes that were included with the meals were very good, but only about twice the size of dollar pancakes.  There was nothing special or outstanding to recommend the place - and it is to far out of the way to make a special trip for breakfast unless you live in Fountain Hills.

My daughter was visiting from Fairbanks, AK and her one year old twins came down with an upper respiratory flu type illness.  Because they are covered by Tri-Care, we were told to take them to the nearest hospital, which happened to be Scottsdale Healthcare.  I went with her to emergency, holding one of the twins.  We were promptly greeted by the front desk, and histories were taken.  They also took a blood test to see the oxygen content of the children's blood. After about a 15 minute wait for test results, we were seen by one of the emergency room physicians.  He discussed his findings with us in detail, the plus and minus of different treatment modalities, and his recommendations.  I am a healthcare professional, but my daughter isn't, and she had several questions, which he explained clearly and patiently.    Also delightful was the person taking the insurance information (which did not happen until we were almost done).  He was personable, and obviously delighted with children, as he spent more time playing with them, than getting the information from my daughter.  It was a very pleasant experience, and it actually took less time for the emergency room visit, than to get their prescriptions filled.  I might note that it wasn't particularly busy that night, so it might be different if they are swamped.  Of course, I did manage to catch what the grandchildren had - aren't kids great!!

The best that can be said of my golf game is that I am enthusiastic.  My son, who is a professional golfer, tells me that I can't buy a golf game - that you can only get it through practice.  Well, I have taken his advice, but sad to say, I can't get it through golf practice either.  But I do enjoy looking at golf equipment.  That being said, the PGA Tour Superstore puts all golf things together in one spot.  It is a "superstore" in every sense, having everything from shoes, balls, bags, accessories, every major manufacturer of clubs,  apparel, and even golf decorations for the home.  They also have a number of cages for trying out new clubs, a huge putting area, and even a sand trap.  For those golfers that need clubs repaired, grips put on, or clubs adjusted, there is a shop at the front of the store that can help.  They also have fitting that is available - although I have not tried that.  I do know that because they have all the manufacturers available, they are not vested in trying to sell any one brand.  I had sold my old Taylormade driver to a friend of mine, and they had a number of year old Ping G10 drivers on discount (they happened to be the same as one I owned).  None of the drivers had the same shaft I had, so I tried all of them in one of the cages.  The salesman simply got me set up in the cage, and left me alone to swing to my heart's content.  I did eventually found one that seemed  close to my old one, but it took some time.  And more importantly, the salesman left me alone to find the one I wanted, without any high pressure sales tactics.  My son has used the golf shop for grips, and bending his irons.  He was quite pleased with the results - they were ready the same day (he had a tournament) and done perfectly.  The service so far has been excellent.  They help you if you would like help, and leave you alone if you just want to browse.  I have visited this store on a weekly basis, and think every golfer should visit it at least once.  And who knows - maybe you can't buy a golf game - but it sure is fun dreaming.

Since I bought my Van, I've been looking for a place to make an extra set of keys.  Unfortunately, it has a computer chip, and I didn't trust any of the bogus reviews that I kept seeing on Yelp for locksmiths.  I had talked with Ace Hardware, and they thought they could do it, but after seeing the keys,  they didn't want to take the chance of ruining the chip.  So they referred me to Mercury Safe and Lock.  It took me a while to find them - they are located in the shopping center on the Northeast corner of Shea and Scottsdale next to Sportsman's Wine.  They knew immediately what I wanted and were able to help me.  It did take a little longer than I expected, because they have to call the manufacture for the pin code.  While I was waiting, I had a chance to look at their merchandise. They have quite a selection of Safes, dead bolts, latches, locks, etc.  And they do automotive keys - so if you are looking to have extra keys made for your car, this is the place to go.  They are relatively expensive, but it is just a fraction of the cost of getting keys programmed by the dealer.

I'm always on the search for a cajun restaurant to try - it doesn't matter whether it is good, bad or indifferent. I can always seem to find something I like, and with cajun food, I am pretty easy to satisfy.  We decided to give Lafitte's a try, although we wondered what a cajun restaurant was doing in an Embassy Suites Hotel.  We did manage to find it, and we were pleasantly surprised.  The menu was not all cajun/creole dishes - it is a general restaurant for the hotel so there are a number of different menu items for those not interested in cajun.  Although we didn't get to try everything, we did opt for our usual  - gumbo and shrimp etoufee, and a cup of jambalaya. We were pleasantly surprised - all were fairly authentic, and quite good. The size of the servings were larger than normal, which was nice.  It might be noted that the jambalaya is not your typical restaurant version - it is a rice mixture covered in a very dark roux. We both loved it, but we are use to dark rouxs - many would feel the taste offsetting.  Only two minor negatives.  It would have been nice if they would have had at least one beer from Louisiana - the beer list was really limited, which was surprising to me. And a person might want to order extra rice, as the portions were large, but came with only one scoop of rice.  The prices were more than reasonable, and I am sure we will return to try other menu items.

Visited the PGA Superstore and noticed a new BBQ place in the Pima Center, so of course, I had to try it.  It was in the late afternoon,  and kind of quiet, so I sat in the bar portion. The restaurant was quite large - several seating areas and patio areas.  I liked the setup, as it gave it the restaurant an open feeling, and an opportunity to sit outside.    Now I'm not a barbecue aficionado - I like all kinds of  barbecue and don't know the difference between rubs and sauces, or the different regions.  I just know that I very seldom find  anything I dislike.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a glass of their Honey Ale beer.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sandwich - it was quite good, and seemed cooked to perfection.  It was served with fresh onions and pickles on the side, which was really nice.  The bun seemed to soak up the sauce a little to much, and it became soggy - but since I usually end up with barbecue sauce from one end of me to the other, it didn't really phase me.  And they do have rolls of paper towels at every table for people like me, so I was good.  Another plus is that they have hot sauce in case the barbecue sauce isn't hot enough for your taste - and I used it liberally.  The service was great, with one exception.  They had plenty of employees there, which is a great plus.  But they give you a buzzer when you place the order, and then you wait for it to buzz, and then go pick up your order.  I thought with that many employees, they should have at least been able to bring the meal to you.  The other problem is limited parking.  It is in a shopping center and the parking directly around the restaurant is limited, so you will probably have to walk.  I did enjoy it, and will be back.  Next time I will try one of their samplers or assorted sliders and some of their sides, and be able to do an updated review.

This is a beautiful golf course, designed by one of my favorites, Ted Robinson. Some of the notable courses he has designed are Sahalee, Rhodes Ranch in Las Vegas,  Tuscany in Henderson, and Temecula Inn in California.  Almost all of his designs have an abundance of water, and Ocotillo is no different. Throughout the course, ponds, streams, waterfalls, and fountains make this a very unusual desert course.  It makes for very interesting golf, and if you have a tendency to stray off line, very difficult. There are three nine hole courses that depending on the day, are combined for 18 holes.  All are very playable if the correct tees are selected, and range from red - 5100 to gold - 6700.    The course is in great condition, and managed by Troon Golf.  They do a very good job, and keep the course in very good to excellent condition.  There is a driving range, and above average practice facilities.  It might be noted that the course is surrounded by homes, but they are very out of the way, and a player doesn't have to worry about hitting into them.  Pace of play varies, depending of course on what kind of group you have in front of you.  Usually you can finish between four and five hours, and usually there is a marshall on the course.  Bernard's is also very nice, and is a great place to relax after 18 holes. They have a snack bar,  full bar, and full service restaurant, so you have a wide range of choices. The service is fast, friendly and efficient.  The only downside was that several of the persons working in the pro shop were not very outgoing - very business like, but not very social.    However, all in all, a great experience, and I will make this one of my favorite courses in the valley.

Green Chili Pork Stew!!!  I love it - and I heard that this new restaurant had it on their Happy Hour menu.  I had never heard of Chef Robert McGrath, or his reputation, so I wandered over to the Renegade Canteen on an early Friday night to try their stew. What a mistake - it was packed, with standing room only in the bar.  The greeter was very friendly and personable, and seemed really disappointed that I did not want to stay or wait.  But I told her that I would be back when it wasn't as busy.  I returned the following afternoon during happy hour, and it wasn't quite as hectic. I was able to sit at the bar, and was quite impressed with the restaurant.  The interior was quite nice, with lots of dark wood, and open spaces, all very nicely decorated. All of the servers and bartenders were really nice, and obviously they were having fun working there.  I did order the Green Chili Pork Stew, and it was great and everything I had hoped!!  I will keep coming back just for that dish alone.  They also had a nice selection of beer and a fairly representative wine list.  But sitting at the bar and watching what some of the other diners ordered, I may have to expand my horizons.  All of the food looked amazing - from their Buzzard's Breath Chili to "Bob's Big Burger". (I actually waited to see how they would eat these gigantic burgers - I would never have been able to get it in my mouth).  They also have soups, flatbreads, entrees and steaks - all at fairly reasonable prices.   And I did meet Chef McGrath, who was making sure that each of the diners were enjoying their evening.  It was nice to see that he was really interested in their thoughts and opinions of his food, and would treat his customers as valued guests.  A great dining experience - just make sure that if you are going to Happy Hour, get there early!!!

Never being able to pass up a new sports, I saw great reviews of the Blue 32 Sports Grill by Michael C and Donald S.  I figured that was just what I needed to add to my list of places to watch the hapless Seattle Mariners (and Seahawks) - an upscale sports bar.  At least if my teams lose, I can watch in a comfortable environment.  And lose they did, 11-6, perhaps on their way to setting a season record for the most losses ever by a Mariner's team.  But I digress.  The Blue 32 is very nice, and I particularly like the way it is set up.  There is a very nice bar, all the requisite flat TV's,  and the sections are split up where everyone has an excellent view of the games.    More importantly, the food is very good - much better than an average sports bar.  I had their Shrimp Poor Boy and it was wonderful.  The other diners sitting near me had everything from pasta to ribs to steak, and everything looked delicious.  I asked about Happy Hour specials for food, and they had not decided yet what they were going to have as specials (but they do have a list of Happy Hour drinks on their menu, and they do plan on adding some type of food specials at some time).  I sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and attentive.  She answered the menu questions I had, and was very on top of things.  I was very impressed that the servers were organized and efficient - especially since they had only been open for several weeks.  This is definitely a place that I will be visiting in the future.  Not  to watch the dismal Seattle teams, but just to grab a sandwich or a quick meal at a reasonable price.

This was previously posted under Teakwood Tavern Grill - which now has this new listing ...  I'd been driving by this place for over a year, and just never stopped in.  It was called the Teakwood's Tavern and Grill and looking at the reviews on Yelp, it didn't seem to offer much.  But then I heard that it had changed hands, and now was a place to try.  It is now called the "Tavern Grill".  Their specials were supposed to be great, and since I am always looking for a good deal, I thought I would check it out.  I stopped in the first time on a Thursday, and it was $3 Margaritas, and half price appetizers all day.  It was packed - there was a game on, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. I sat at the bar, and the bartenders were swamped, but they were still able to give good service. I tried several of their appetizers, and it was above average for bar food. And cheap.  I later went back on a Tuesday night to watch a Diamondbacks game.  The special that night was $3.00 Mexican beers, $1.00 beef or chicken tacos, and $2.00 fish tacos.  Dinner for less than $10.00!!  And I didn't have to cook.    And the great thing is they have peanuts - and you just throw the shells on the floor.  For me, this is a great attraction.  Nothing better to watch a game, drink beer and eat peanuts - almost like you were at the ball park.  They do have a separate dining room in the back, and specials for children.    This is a great sports bar, inexpensive food, and pleasant service.  Although it gets hectic for big sports events, it is a lot of fun, and makes for a very inexpensive evening.

I originally saw the Spotted Donkey some time ago and thought they were out of business. It seems that they were just taking their time opening it to make sure everything was right. And they nailed it. When I first went in I wandered around and checked out the dining area, the lounge and the patios. All very impressive.  The only thing that struck me rather odd was the order pick up counter in the dining area did not seem to fit with the rest of the decor.  But the dining area also extends into the bar area, and if you sit there, you do not seem to notice it as much.  I first stopped for Happy Hour - and what a great Happy Hour. Draft and bottle beer - $3.00, appetizers for $4.00, and well drinks and frozen Margaritas $5.00.  I tried several of the "lite bites" including the Cinco Queso Dip, the guacamole, and the Taquitos - all were delicious. And, of course, they have Dos Equis Amber on tap which is a great plus.  I returned for dinner several nights later, and it was just as good.  They have an eclectic menu with a variety of standard Mexican dishes with slightly different ingredients in some to give them a different taste. Everything we tried was very good, and excellent blend of flavors, and hotness.  The service was very friendly and attentive, from the hostess to our servers, to the bartenders. It was the little things they did that showed they wanted our visit to be a pleasurable experience. They do have several high definition TV's, and we asked that one of them be changed to watch a game we were interested in. They had no problem with doing that, and actually went out of the way to find the channel.  We had a baby with us, and everyone was very helpful and friendly in accommodating us.   I also requested fresh chopped jalapeno to sprinkle on some of my dishes, and they actually had it and brought it with no questions asked, and no extra charge (which does not happen often).  Although not as authentic as some of my favorite small Mexican restaurants, it is a great dining experience, and someplace that I can bring friends and visitors. The atmosphere and decor are rather trendy, but at the same time relaxing and comfortable. A great combination!!

I had read the positive reviews of Taberna, and decided I would treat my son's family, which included an 8 month old baby.  We carefully plotted  the time so she would be at her best, and off we went. We were immediately seated, water and chips were brought to our table with a green and red sauce. So far, so good.  And then we waited, and waited, and waited.  We finished all of the chips and salsa, and finally decided to check with the hostess and see if there was a waiter available.  (The delay was good - it gave us ample opportunity to explore the restaurant - and it was very impressive. Several dining areas, a seating area with couches, a bar, and a large patio for warm summer evenings.)  Several minutes later a waiter finally appeared, and apologized - apparently there was a large party of twenty or so, and they had forgotten to tell the waiter we were there.  The menu is small, but has a variety of options.  All of them looked delicious, so we all tried something different. I had the steak tacos, my son had the fish tacos, and my daughter in law had the chicken enchilada.  All were wonderful, but everyone thought the enchilada was the best. The guacamole was different - it had pumpkin seeds in it - but delicious. And the flan was equally outstanding.  We really liked the chips and plantain - and the salsas were excellent.  We did manage to eat several baskets of the chips, and all agreed that they were great.  The waiter, hostess and manager went out of their way to make everything right for the delay.  Usually I am not bothered by slow service, but with an eight month old baby, we were anxious to order so we could finish before she became restless and irritable.  So once we had a waiter, we were fine.  But they insisted that they would make it up to us - giving us free drinks, free appetizer and a free desert.  Andrew, our waiter was superb, and made the meal very enjoyable.When we go back, we will definitely ask to be seated in Andrew's section.  So after a bad start, a very enjoyable meal.

Being a good husband, I volunteered to take my wife to another day at Sister's Closet. It takes her hours to go through everything - and I'm usually left to find something to do to kill time.  Fortunately, they now have an Einstein's in the same shopping area.  A lifesaver!! I was able to have several cups of coffee, some wonderful onion bagels with cream cheese, and to casually read the newspaper without being hurried and feeling I was taking up space.  It is large, clean, and the workers a cheerful and helpful.  The only glitch was that on one of my bagel orders, they lost the order!! Not a big deal - I wasn't going anywhere  - so once they figured out the order got lost in cyberspace - they immediately re-entered it and brought it to my table.  So now I'm covered - if my wife has to be at Sisters early in the morning, I can relax at Einsteins!!

I noticed that a new Jimmy John's had opened on Hayden in McCormick Ranch.  I am a sandwich fan, and had heard about Jimmy John's for several years, but had never been able to stop and try one. So since it was close, I decided to see why everybody was recommending them.  It wasn't busy when I arrived, so I was able to ask some questions, and take my time deciding what I wanted.    I ordered a Vito, which is essentially an 8" Italian sub.  I was impressed - not only was it fresh, but the bread was delicious.  The only thing that I was disappointed with was that it was not as filling as I expected. Now when I go, I order of the "Giant" side of the menu, and it is just right.  Great sandwich shop, and one of my regular stops on my way home from golf.

I was really looking forward to checking this place out. I noticed the last time I was in the area, that construction was going on, so I decided to stop by once I saw it was open.    It was in the early evening, and it was fairly busy.  I sat at the bar, since I primarily wanted to see what the menu was like, and to have a drink.  My initial impression was dampened by the fact that they had no beers on tap, and the bartender was far from friendly.  He just did not have any social skills.   Looking at the menu, there was nothing that seemed to stand out.   I was disappointed in the interior - but the patio was really nice.  There was nobody using it, but it was spacious and looked like it would be very nice when the weather cooled.  Plenty of TV's and the service seemed prompt.  After having my drink, and doing some people watching, I decided to leave. I have the same feeling of some of the other reviewers. Although the crowd was somewhat mixed, it was primarily older people (and yes, I am  one of the people over 60).  But since I am not one of the old men that steals drinks, or interested in cougars, I found little to recommend here.

Always willing to give a new beer place a try.  I had heard that Nimbus had opened in the old Taberna site, and thought I would stop and see what it was.   I was really surprised, because I had heard such good things about Nimbus in Tucson, so maybe I was expecting to much.  The interior had little or no character.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender seemed bored and uninterested. I asked about the different types of beer, and she really had no idea how to describe them.  I ordered a draft of one to try, and then she handed me a menu - which actually had beer descriptions on it. It would have been nice to see that, prior to ordering.  That said, the beer was good, but not so good as to override the lack of ambience, and the average service.

I'd heard about Il Bosco from Yelp, was in the area, and thought I would try some of their pizza.  It is very small, with a small outside seating area.  The menu has pizza, salads, two appetizers, and two desserts.  They have a wood fired pizza oven, which gives their pizza the perfect crust. They do have beer and wine, although a limited selection.  I ordered the Joanna Pizza - pepperoni, sausage, cheese and tomatoes, and had them add onions. It was delicious, one of the best pizza's I have tasted.  I was going to give it a four star rating, but had several pieces left over, which I took home for breakfast the next day.  Wow!! It is the only pizza I have had that actually tasted better the day after!! That in and of itself, bumps them up to a five star rating.  Another plus is their prices are very, very reasonable.  All in all, a great little restaurant.

I'm always up for a Bratwurst and a beer, and since I was in the area, thought I would give this place a try.  I'm glad I did. I had coincidentally entered the bar, rather than the dining area; the bar, was of course, was where I wanted to be, so I was good!! It happened to be in the mid-afternoon, and it was very quiet - in fact, I was the only one there.  So I had a chance to talk with the bartender, take my time looking at the different types of beer, and getting recommendations not just on beer, but also on the food,  It was obvious that the bartender loved talking about the beer.  He had full knowledge of the many different types they had, and made several recommendations. I tried two of them, and they were great.  My main reason for stopping was for a bratwurst.  He made several suggestions on the food, and I finally tried the Beer Bratwurst, with the Rootbeer Onions, Sauerkraut, Spicy Peppers, and Relish toppings. It was delicious. The bun was rather large and dry - but it was just right with all the toppings and the condiments I added.  Great place - the service was very good, the bartender very helpful, the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. A great addition to Old Town!!
