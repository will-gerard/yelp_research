This place is wonderful. Bikram Yoga Peoria recommended it and I don't ever want to eat at another Greek place. The gyro salad is my favorite, The pita bread is perfect and the staff is great.

This was an amazing stay! My husband and I came for a staycation night just to get away. We specifically got the suite because we wanted a fireplace, and I was blown away by how beautiful the room was - and the rate I got it at.  Housekeeping sent three people up to my room to deliver firewood and start the fireplace for me - going above and beyond anything I expected. I'm so glad they did as I thought it would be electric.  In-room dining was delicious and the service during was great; we ordered dinner, dessert and breakfast. Not once did I have a moment of negative customer service, and on top of that I was interacted with more during this one night stay than with most longer stays I've had other establishments.  Even afterward, we left a hat behind and received an email and phone call about getting it back to us. All that, and I've not even touched on the beauty of the location and hotel itself. Such a great stay - we'll be back. Thank you.

Typical Chipotle flavor but the service staff always seems annoyed and they're light on that guac we all pay to have added.

Zero stars. Unacceptable wait. Unacceptable customer service with a "sorry just deal with it attitude." Although that seems to be Verizon's way regardless of how you're trying to get assistance.

Jabz is such a welcome change to my fitness routine! I've been going since Mid-March, and I'm completely obsessed!   Each day has a different body focus, and each day I leave feeling stronger and amped to start my day. We incorporate kicks and punching daily, regardless of workout, and we get that cardio in, too! All in 45 minutes! Amazing!   It's nice to have the 16 max girls in class. You get to know each other and receive lots of feedback from the trainers. Speaking of trainers, Jeremy and Kylie are wonderful! I've never had a class with Jennifer but I've heard good things.   Want to talk results? I'm down approximately 15 lbs since starting (with good nutrition,too), and my body hasn't been this strong since my days of competitive sports.   If you're looking for a workout community, are sick of big gyms or just want to change things up, I highly recommend Jabz in Glendale!
