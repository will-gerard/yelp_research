Saturday has kids from school of rock jamming. Happy hour from 3p-8p. Good spot for a beer and live entertainment.

The bartender is amazing and knowledgable, he provided us with a flavor profile ... descibing the flavors in every drink. In addition he is able to provide excellent service and still has time to explain everything and socialize. The happy hour food is not bar food, its very upscale and meticulously prepared.

If youre looking for a great barber in this area you need to check out this spot and make an appointment with Allison. She is a perfectionist and took the time to make my experience relaxing and worth the stop. Appointments are highly recommended. Straight shave was one of the best i ever had!
