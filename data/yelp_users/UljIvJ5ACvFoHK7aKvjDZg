Ugh! Walmart. I wish the staff here cared more.

I've been to this Discount Tire place several times, and the staff has always been helpful and knowledgeable. Their warranties are great, and they never pressure me to buy more than is safe. They are consistent and good!

I like this thai restaurant a lot for their pad thai.  Very flavorful.  Consistently good service.

I've been to Liberty market several times and always recommend it to friends.  Everything I've tried here has been very good.  Their service is organized and great.  Sometimes you might see Joe, the owner walking around and talking to people.  Of the three restaurants of Joe's (Liberty, Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Barbeque), Liberty Market is my favorite.  Random, but take a trip to the bathroom - they are very innovative and cool.   There is also lots of fresh produce and supplies that you can buy.

I come here about once a week for lunch.  The pizza is always amazing, and they have a great lunch deal.  The reason for 4 stars? The staff is rude and impersonal.

I have stayed at this hotel while hosting two conferences for work. The rooms are nice and the staff is helpful. Love the Westin workout! Best hotel gym I've ever seen. It also has nice places to hang out.

I came here as a nervous newly engaged girl. Tiffany helped me to pick out the dresses I wanted and then recommended some that I might like. Even if I don't buy my dress there, I would recommend it to anyone in the wedding party.

This is one of the best thai places! I have moved 5 times since I found Thai Basil and I still go out of my way to order there. My favorites are the curry dishes and the pad thai. Service is Good and fast.

After reading amazing reviews, I came to Altered Ego for a cut and color. Morgan did a fantastic job! I plan to keep going!

After my hair stylist moved, I was wary of finding another good one.  I found great reviews on Altered Ego and decided to take a chance...  Not only is this salon super cute in decorations, but it is family owned and well-established. My stylist knew how to help me and did a great job on my cut and color.   When I went back a second time, my stylist and the person at the front desk gave me knowledgeable recommendations  on quality products to use.  I found a winner in Altered Ego!

We went on vacation in Las Vegas and chose a spa suite the MGM Grand. We had a great experience, expect for one thing: the check-in process. We had to wait in line forever at the check-in area. Then, when we got to our room, we realized it wasn't a spa suite, and we had a hard time getting the room we ordered.   Other than that, our room was great, and comfortable.

What do I love about this place? The cool menu! Yes, the wasabi is blue, and yes it's a trendy bar, and yes it's a little pricey, and yes, I would recommend it. My fave roll: the Marilyn Monroll - complete with pink rice paper.

This place is not your average automotive service business. Their customzer service is amazing! A comfortable waiting room with snacks, a controllable tv and magazines that cover more than cars? I'll take that any day. They also have an amazing deal on oil changes. Their quotes for repairs are reasonable.  As a girl, a lot of automotive technicians talk down to me and pressure me into services. I didn't get this treatment here. They were respectful!

This Fry's is right next to my work, so I hop over here for a quick bite at lunch. They are doing a lot of renovating right now and the organization of the store makes no sense. However, it will have a sushi bar and be much bigger when they are done.

This LA Fitness is just like all other locations. Cardio kickboxing class with Andrea is awesome!!!  I don't like how packed it gets during the 5-7 hour. And they hold the body fat percentage calculator hostage and make you sign up for training for it.

This coffee house is a quiet, peaceful place, with great natural light and a beautiful garden patio.  Great place to go to visit with a friend, read, write, or relax. Great selection of coffee, tea and italian soda.

I really like this place. I'm from San Francisco, and this Chinese food is the closest to home I've experienced in Arizona. One of the only places that has honey pecan prawns. Yum!  Updated review: 2/10/13- Honey pecan prawns aren't there anymore, but it's still good!

Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  this food is consistently good.  I do not like the feeling inside the restaurant, but if  it is a nice day, their outdoor tables are great!

The queen creek olive mill hosts a great variety of products and events.  iI've eaten at the restaurant once, and it was good. The only downside is that it's popularity makes it very crowded and hectic.  Perhaps the best aspect of the olive mill is the Olive oil and the spreads.  So good! It is expensive, but it is worth it!

I love the food here, and the olive oil and other products. They always throw fun events too.  Four stars? Because I left a voicemail with them with a special request, but never got a call back.

This is my go-to sushi place in Gilbert. There is a great variety of sushi, and non sushi items, and the food is consistently good. I always bring sushi lovers here, and they always want to come back.  The only reason I gave 1 star is because my husband, who does not like sushi, was not a fan of the teriyaki. I agree that it was bland.

I had a great experience here today. My mom other in law and sister in law recommended it to me. They have very thick, curly hair and I have very fine, straight hair so I was concerned about it. I also decided to highlight my hair for the first time.   At the end of the day, my hair looked amazing, and it was healthy. Priscilla helped me feel comfortable with this big change too. I like that she did my hair exactly as I asked, but also offered recommendations.   They were very warm and helpful here. And when I had to go to work in the middle of my appointment, they worked around my schedule.  Good job Curls Gone Wild!

It's hard to find Chinese Food that isn't covered in grease. When we moved to San Tan Valley, this was the first place we tried. We've since tried other Chinese restaurants in the area, and we love this one the most.  At China Chef, the food is consistently good, the menu has good variety, and the customer service is good. The portions are good too.

The great thing about this gym is that, even during busy hours, it isn't completely packed. Another great thing: the energizer bar. Love the smoothies!

Walmart as a chain is okay. his particular Walmart is horrible.  I have been here several times, and each time I have not been happy with the selection, the service or the attitude of the employees.  Go to the Walmart on Dobson and 8th street.

As far as selection goes, this Office Max has the same selection. As far as customer service goes, it's not so great. I've been here several times, and the staff is always in a hurry to get away from helping me, or they are not present at all.  There was another time, when the girl at the checkout counter was just rude. There was a very friendly guy in front of me, and he was very nice to her and trying to make her smile, and she just glowered at him. He didn't deserve that! I got the cold shoulder too.

Most nail places offer pretty standard services, and so does this one. I did have to wait for a few minutes before sitting down for my full set, but the technician did a great job, and was very careful.

My husband and I decided to go here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Of course, it was busy, but we were unimpressed. Isn't Denny's supposed to be equipped for busy on a Sunday morning? We ordered an appetizer, but it never came. The reasoning: it takes a long time to cook them. Our food was OK, but it could have been better.

If you want a GIANT milkshare in a variety of flavors- this is the place to go. The food was cooked well and the staff was friendly. Next time I feel like cheating on my diet, this place is definitely an option.
