I used to come here a lot because it is convenient. Its overpriced as hell, and they have shit selection, but the previous owner (?) Steve was nice. They have a variety of stuff, but not a good selection of anything. Cider and wine selections are ridiculous and the staff doesnt know what they carry, so forget about the drive thru. Cant think of a reason to go back really.

What a mess!!! Looking for outdoor fabric and this place is close to home, so it was our first stop. No outdoor fabric could be found, but in fairness, I am not the type of person that likes to "hunt" for things. I'm more of a get in get out kinda girl, and this store is most definitely NOT conducive to that way of shopping.  After a quick circle around the shop, we went and asked where the outdoor fabric is. Answer: "if we have it, I would think it's near the upholstery". If? Think? We circled again but there is zero organization in the place, and I was shopping with someone that doesn't have patience for that, so we quickly left.   Also, crowded and dirty. If they had organization, training, and a mop, they would get more business. They could even raise prices. But, I'm sure there are people that would rather dig and shop in a less fancy place to save the money, and if that's you, this is a good place. Never thought I would feel like a fabric store snob, but I guess that's me.

I've always liked this place. Never liked the bathroom tho. Not sure why bigger girls with stomach issues seem to prefer the stall with no door, but that's been my experience. It's gross to scoot/climb around the knees of some portly chick doing the devils work when all I need is to get to the sink. Other than that, always had fun.   We went for the chili cook off, which was fun. There were about 30 booths, most with chili and salsa to sample. The $10 tasting kit came with 10 cups, hardly enough if I wanted to try all, but most booths had chips to use if you didn't have cups (or a tasting kit - waste of $).   Regardless, still a good time. I love roscoes and will go back, but really wish they would do something about the bathroom. OH and stainless steel toilets are ice fucking cold on girl bums!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, this is a long story, but I'll do my best. Brought the girlfriend's Passat in to have the service light checked, a/c checked, and it was making a strange noise. Wheel bearings, ac leak fixed, oil changed and tires rotated. Pickup car, service light still on, and makes a different funny noise. Call up, they have us bring it back, apologizing for the light, and thinking they just need to balance the tires. I thought that was automatically done after a rotation, but hey, I'm no mechanic! Offered a free oil change on her truck as compensation, and since she had brought it in anyway for its own a/c issue, she was happy with that.   This ordeal lasted over a week, dealing with multiple employees and manager. The first guy that worked on the Passat apparently quit that day, the next guy had to leave because his wife had a baby, etc.   Eduardo told her that all her hoses needed replaced and several other things, before he gave her a diagnosis of the problem we brought it in for in the first place. At this point, we just want to pick it up. So we do, and now the airbag light is blinking. Manager (Seth) refused to speak to us and then we were hung up on.   Pretty ridiculous. Not sure if this is because we are women or what, but us being female shouldn't have anything to do with the fact they don't seem capable of fixing a problem without causing a new one. Francisco was the only person there worth talking to. He was great, but sadly there were too many other things wrong.

This is a wonderful alternative to going on vacation at a fancy resort. The options are limitless and the attractions are many. There truly is something for everyone here.   They have a kids area with rides from your elementary school carnival. You know the slide that takes off a layer of skin and shocks your ass all the way down? Also, the tilt-a-whirl, no doubt filled with sun-baked vomit. There is a petting zoo, and you can even feed and ride miniature livestock!  You can buy a bird here, and even get a brazillian wax for $45 from a toothless woman. Dining options include pork rinds, funnel cakes, and snow cones.  In all seriousness, it's only $2, the people watching is decent, they have beer, and you might find something cool. I didn't think the prices were spectacular, but maybe I have unrealistic expectations.

I've been coming here since I was in dipes. I eat here at least twice a month. Sometimes lunch, sometimes dinner, never on Mondays. My dad lives in Washington state and when he comes to visit, he literally goes from the airport directly here. I always get the enchilada/taco combo. Prices are great, food is excellent. The salsa is amazing, with a nice kick. My girlfriend actually doesn't like the enchilada sauce here because it clearly has cinnamon in it and apparently that's not her thing. The only thing I can say I don't like is that the taco has the cheese on the outside of the shell. ?? Weird. Yeah, the place is old, but so what? My grandmas place is old, too, but the best food I've ever had came out of her kitchen. Don't judge a book by its cover! Or, do, more for me.

I've been here one time before to get a drug screen and physical for my job. Had a long wait then, but I didn't really care that day. Yesterday, I came here for a drug screen and check up after a car accident. The girl at the desk told me to "give her a minute" to get me in the system and they'd get me in. Hour and a half later, I ask if she knows how much longer, as I have to pee but have to hold it for the drug test, plus headache, nausea, and not to mention covered in blood. Kinda want outta here. I was told they have a high number of "urgent injuries" so it's taking longer. Uhhhhhhh ?? I mean, I don't know what their definition of urgent is, but I didn't see anyone else with blood.   Finally get seen and they told me I need to go to ER immediately (hey thanks for the wait!) for a ct scan. And they forgot to give me a tetanus shot.   I just hope I don't have to come back to this place. It's too long of a wait.

I came here to find some cheap fabric because my girlfriend and I are making  cushions for our patio chairs. Only problem is that neither of us know how to sew lol. The fabric we want for the final product is $25/yard, so we want to do a few rough drafts first, and that's what brought us here. Also, this place still has patterns, which we also wanted to look at.  They had a section of clearance fabric, and we were able to find something to meet our needs at a pretty low cost. We also spent a lot of time looking at patterns and picked out a couple.   I did notice that the outdoor fabric they had was lower quality than the stuff we chose at another store (Sunbrella, the $25/yd stuff), the selection was only a few styles, and the price was actually HIGHER.   The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the staff here were very good, bathrooms were clean, and the store has everything for crafts, kinda like a michaels but more open and easier to shop in. Wasn't impressed with the prices, however.

I know very little about cigars and have never smoked one, but I came in to this shop at the the girl's  request as she is in need of a cigar box to build a guitar with. When I walked in, I was greeted promptly and I asked if they sold cigar boxes. The gentleman working there showed me a stack of about 15 boxes to look at. They were all different and each one was unique. I picked out a few I thought she would like and a couple more so she'd have a selection to choose from. Girlfriend was impressed by the boxes I picked up for her, and is excited to start her project. She literally just now told me she can also build an amp using a cigar box. I can't wait to see what else she comes up with. Personally, I'm planning on making a jewelry box for myself out of one of the ones she doesn't use.

I have seen several shows here, and despite the over priced and weak drinks, nightmare security, and disgusting bathrooms, I come back because I like music and apparently no one bothers to check how bad a venues reviews are before deciding to play there. That being said, I attempted to attend a show there recently. My friend, that has a brain injury, was confused by security telling her she couldn't have gum. And a pen. GUM! I'm well aware of this anti-gum stance they have, but she was not. When she questioned the OVERLY THOROUGH security "lady", she was denied entry, security claiming she was intoxicated. So, next day, I call to speak to the General Manager, Donnie Johnson. This man is horrendous. I was spoken to very condescendingly, and in a manner that gave me the impression he flat didn't believe me or CARE at all. When my friend called him, he literally shouted at her, told her it was her fault for not informing them in advance that she had a condition like that and that the marquee "doesn't employ doctors as security". Then, he gave her "to the count of three" to tell him what she wanted. She's not THREE YEARS OLD! When she didn't answer him quickly enough, he hung up on her. Great customer service here. I'll never go back. I have a lot of free time. I'll be voicing my opinion all over the internet.

A friend and I came in after she had boot camp, to undo the progress she just made. She had chicken fajitas, I had a beef enchilada, pretty standard fare. I definitely like the location, and it's very big. There isn't a whole lot of parking, but it is close to the light rail. They also have a big outdoor patio which seems great for happy hours or birthday parties or anything where you have a big group. I didn't notice if they have misters, but there is a bar outside and I believe they have games outside, too. The service we had was good. Our food came out fast, our order was correct, and it was pleasant, except for the person at the next table celebrating her 28th birthday with a loud song from the staff. Never understood that bizarre ritual myself, but it seemed like she was enjoying herself, too, so good on Macayo's!

I used to be a huge fan of Buffalo Exchange, so I came in today looking for jeans, skirts, dresses, shoes, accessories, just whatever.... I have always hated bringing my clothes here to sell or trade because the staff and the value given both suck (i'll come back to this), but the prices and selection to purchase stuff always impressed me. I also liked the option to choose a token for charity instead of a bag, but I don't know if they still do that because I didn't buy anything today.   I started out looking at jeans, and the lowest price I found was $25. The average price was $32, and when I came across a pair for $42, I stopped looking. Next I went to look at boots, but they didn't have many in my size (womens 8). At this point, my girlfriend was ready to leave because she was disappointed at the high prices, too, so I didn't have a chance to look at anything else.   As for selling stuff, the worst part is the staff. They make it quite the humiliating experience, to say the least. The looks on their faces are as if they are sifting through a pile of raw sewage brought before them by the disease-ridden underbelly of society. I'm not sure who led them to believe they are the all superior upper echelon of the fashion industry, but perhaps they should be enlightened to the actual reality which is their life.   Bottom line, super disappointed all the way around. We went to Goodwill from here, where we both found tons of stuff and went home happy.

Came here with a good friend for lunch. She had a burger and a beer, I had the salmon with roasted veggies. The atmosphere is always amazing. This was her first time. It was a little hard for her to find, but other than that she had a good experience. The am always impressed with the food and the restrooms are always clean. $50 with tip, kinda steep for lunch, but we both had alcohol with our food. Then again, I haven't seen her in a year, so it was worth it. I will continue to come here and introduce new people to it. One of my favorite spots!

Came here for dinner because I was craving the beer I always get here, RoseGaarden, so my lovely girlfriend was kind enough to bring me. This beer is a blend of hoegaarden and I believe raspberry ambroisia. We both had classic cheeseburgers, mine with pepper jack and BACON ! Both burgers cooked perfect, came with some delicious sauce, and plenty of fries that come in a separate metal cup type thing. This is nice for me since I don't really like my food to touch, and gives me extra plate space for ketchup. Both of us were happy and full. Only thing is kinda pricey. $50 for two burgers, a coke, and a beer.

Came in for lunch today after an exhaustive morning searching estate sales for vintage furniture. The girl and i split the tuna salad sandwich. I have no complaints on the sandwich. I like the big chunks of tuna, cucumbers, and fruit.  my girlfriend prefers untoasted bread, but other than that, she loved it, too. We ordered mimosas, but ended up with a pitcher of sangria instead. We werent in the mood for sangria, & the manager refunded it right away. She also offered us mimosas, but we declined since we were already done with our meal. Overall great experience, as always.

I love this place and come here every time i am in vegas. My fav bartender is Steven. He's hot for one thing but also he can slay cherries on a cocktail sword clenched between his teeth! I cant even catch popcorn in my mouth. They have live music at night, its a fun atmosphere, & the people watching never disappoints.

Absolutely LOVE this place! Went for dinner last night with the girlfriend, a friend and her mom. The appetizer we wanted was no longer on the menu, as Tomaso likes to change the menu regularly, but we asked for it anyway and our request was happily granted. We ordered a bottle of Tomaso's own red wine, Luxur 2004, fabulous! Our appetizer was lemon caper shrimp. Filet mignon was perfection, and for dessert we had fudge truffles. I asked for strawberries with the truffles and again, wish granted with zero hesitation. Everything was perfect as always. I wouldn't bring a girl here on a first date cuz it's a bit spendy for a girl that has no guarantee, but the place definitely drops panties.

Had dinner here on Tuesday night. The waitstaff was friendly and prompt. I had the seared ahi tuna with cilantro jalapeño hummus. I loved it, but my girlfriend felt the tuna was slightly over cooked. She ordered the wood fired chicken. That was excellent as well. I actually liked the flavor of hers better, but both dishes were awesome! I would also like to add that the temp inside the restaurant was comfortable. Most of the time, regardless of time of year, I find most places to be too cold, but this time I was able to leave my jacket off and was never uncomfortable. The parking lot at this location is crowded but I found a spot no problem. The restaurant was full but no wait. Only thing I didn't check out the bathroom, but the rest of the place was clean, so I would be surprised if the bathroom wasn't.

Stayed four nights here with my girlfriend for a business conference. When we arrived, the line to check in was not bad. We arrived early and we were able to check in early, for a fee, $28 I believe. We were told if we waited 1/2 hour, the fee would only be $15, but they gave us the reduced fee without waiting because of medical reasons. They also provided a refrigerator in room free (normally $25/day) for medical reasons, which is that I had medication that needed to be refrigerated.   Entering the room, I noticed one bed was seriously concave, but the other one was fine. There was a lighted table that the cord had been severed and the wires exposed. We informed the bell guy when he brought our bags but we didn't care enough to change rooms. The carpet was loose, looked like water damage to me. The TV was fine, but has absolutely NO jacks, so you can't hook anything up to watch movies or music or games. They do charge for internet, $13.99/day, PER DEVICE!!!! Good news is Starbucks and some restaurants have free WiFi.   The bathroom was huge and very nice, but the shower was weak. The bathtub is awesome and easily fits two, but ours didn't drain. So, called maintenance. They didn't fix it the first night (GROSS!) but the second time we called, they snaked it, made mess, housekeeping came to clean, whole process took about three hours. I assume the issue was resolved, but we didn't use the tub again after that. Also, when people in other rooms shower, it is loud as hell, but I never heard the people talk or laugh or any other noises lol.  We called to speak with a manager about the plumbing issues. The girl that answered, Olivia, has a thick accent. Apparently she was saying "manager", but to us it sounded like she was saying "money gift", and when we finally figured it out we laughed about the misunderstanding. She was rude, accused my gf of laughing at her, and then hung up on her. Call back and got the GM Brian. He was a dick from the start. He offered to give us a free late check out, which we already had arranged. So, he took off the early check in fee and a room service charge, a total discount of $36.   While speaking with Brian, we discovered that we had a charge for room service that wasn't ours. So, we called the room service manager, Pharrin. She was absolutely awesome! She immediately looked into the incorrect charge, took it off our bill, and even offered to cover our breakfast the following morning!   Overall, it was OK and mostly our individual room & the front desk people that got the 1 star. I would stay there again. All the fees are kinda ridiculous, but there are ways around those.

Came here three times during my trip, once for lunch and twice for breakfast. No line any of the times. Had the lunch special the first visit, $8.99. It included a (whole) roast beef sandwich, and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Both were good. I was more impressed with the soup, mainly because most restaurants have shitty chicken noodle. This was not bland, had big chunks of grilled chicken, and tasty broth. The second time I had two eggs with bacon, coffee, and toast. It was just like anywhere else, but it was $23. Third time, steak & eggs breakfast special, $6.95. Food was good, steak cooked properly, way more food than I could eat. All in all, it was pretty good. I would only order from the specials tho if I ever go again.

Came here in search of outdoor fabric for some cushions. Don't want some boring pattern, boring colors, or flowers, those are for OLD people. We want something that POPS! Well we certainly found it here. Plus, the quality is way way better than we could find anywhere else. Sunbrella is the brand and I'm quite impressed with it.   At first I had sticker shock at the prices, $23-$41/yard!?!?!? But, the rolls are 54" wide, so each yard goes twice as far as other stores (for our project anyway).   This store is impressive! They have so much to look at, it was the equivalent of my eyes salivating like Pavlov's dog. Really got our creative juices flowing for sure. I see some barstools getting recovered in my future!  The only thing that I didn't like was 4 out of 5 employees we worked with offered less than I would expect, attitude-wise. One clearly became frustrated that we didn't use proper terms or know what we were doing, one couldn't answer any questions because he only stuffs cushions, one couldn't operate the register, and the one that could operate it didn't speak a single word to us. And for the honor of their service, we had to wait. The store was busy, though, maybe a weekday would be different. There was one nice girl that showed us around at first, she was great, wish I could remember her name.  Overall good experience, highly recommend.

Had dinner here to celebrate my new job. Waiter Christopher, knew the menu extremely well. My date is from Seattle and is therefore leery of seafood here. She got the steak and it was amazing. I had the mahi mahi and it was delicious as well. Wine also did not disappoint. Will definitely go back.

Stopped in here while waiting for the girl to get her hair cut so I could earn some brownie points with her..... I got a Strawberry shake for her and a chocolate one for myself. I was happy to see they came with a free mix-in. I added strawberries to hers and m&ms to mine. The girl that helped me was fast and friendly, and she gave me some coupons for my next visit. The place was very clean. The shakes were delicious. They also have italian shave ice, which i'll have to try next time. The only thing I could say is that the bathroom was locked (I was the only patron at the time) and I didn't feel like asking for the key, but I don't really consider this a negative since it IS mill ave, after all.

Stopped in for a quick drink and we were greeted by a hot bartender that was a self proclaimed "drink wizard". He told us about the special for the night (which he had to repeat because I was checking in, not listening lol) which was a blueberry vodka and ciroc with lemon juice for $3, or a tall for $1 more. I had the tall, obviously.  Tasted like a slurpie! The girl asked for a strawberry banana drink, which he made perfect for her, not too sweet. We sat outside in this couch area. It was cool, but the thing that initially drew us to it was the privacy, which was gone when the motion detector light came on with the light of 1000 suns. It turned off a few minutes later though and all was good. Overall great experience. Will definitely be back.

I've been here a few times before, but most recently my girl brought me here for lunch on our anniversary. I had the garlic & pepper beef with salad. Absolutely delicious! I chose mild. The flavor was good, but basically no heat. I really like the salad dressing, which is their own recipe. She had a chicken dish that she chose medium spice. It was also really good and good spice level. They serve soda in cans, which I don't really like but it's not the end of the world. The service has always been good and fast. I've only been there for lunch and I've never been late back to work. The place is pretty small, and I like that. It's never been too crowded, which I also like. I will probably eat here a lot more times. If you go and you sit in the small room to the right, you might notice an interesting piece of art on the wall.

Brought my girlfriend here because she has been wanting to check it out for a long time. She had a chardonnay,  and I had "the least sweet red you have" since they were out of cab. Mine was very good and she seemed to like hers. We decided to sit at the tables in the back. I really like that option. Gave us privacy but still a great view. We also really liked the seating areas in the "lobby". We had a  chance to relax and finish our drinks while waiting on our cab. Very nice time. I'm sure I'll bring her back again.

I contacted this company on the recommendation from a friend. I spoke to Leonard when I called about my heat not working. He came over early in the morning while I was still asleep, and hopped on the roof and checked it out. He found the problem right away and took off to get the part. Although I slept through it, I was always kept informed via text message or voice mail. He came by the next day, swapped the part, problem solved!   Fast forward seven months: a/c not working. Call Leonard and his son, Levi, came by the same day. This time it was another simple fix, done quickly and professionally.   Winter again, heater kaput. This is a very old unit, mind you. Levi came out to have a look. He told me he could try cleaning out the unit, but it is labor intensive (therefore, not cheap) and may not even help, ultimately it needed to be replaced. This was in late February and since he was familiar with the history, I asked if he expected the a/c to still work. He said yes, so I decided to wait it out.   A/C finally crapped out in August, so I called the guys, they got me a new unit, installed an additional return for better efficiency, and even helped with financing. I had them take care of a couple plumbing issues, too.   These are wonderful, caring, HONEST, professional men. Very clean and respectful. Job well done!

Stopped here for lunch. Split a brisket supper with a friend. The brisket was amazing! Great sauce. Great service. For sides we had beans and potato salad. Both were good, I preferred the beans. Clean place, nice clean restrooms. Games all around the place. Prices were good. Only thing is they only have plastic silverware, but other than that, we were more than pleased!

Been here a few times before. Food is always good and the service has been all but once. It's kinda spendy, so we checked yelp for other sushi places nearby, but they had negative reviews on the food and the prices were about the same, so we stuck with our usual.  This time, we tried the pineapple rolls. I really liked them. They have a spicy kick to them and the pineapple sauce was delish! Seemed more like a pineapple salsa than sauce, because it was chunky.   We also had the Uppercut wine, which tasted much better than it smelled lol. And we had California rolls. We both left full and the bill was $51 including tax and tip, so overall not bad. I like this spot.

Had time for a bite while waiting for an appointment at the apple store so the girlie and I came in here. We both got the house specialty, short rib enchilada. I had the berry mojito and she had some other vodka drink.   The food was amazing! I especially liked the rice, which had a light lime/cilantro flavor. The beans weren't my favorite. The enchilada was really good. It wasn't your standard enchilada you get anyplace, had a little different flavor in the sauce, but I like that. I like variety and appreciate different places making things their own.   Our server was very nice and good. We were in a slight hurry due to our appointment but we told her when we ordered and asked if she could bring boxes and the check along with the food. She might not have liked that, but if she had a problem with it, we certainly couldn't tell.   The only prob were the prices, $50 for lunch for two is a little high, but in hindsight, one meal would have easily fed us both. Next time I want to get the ceviche. Looked fantastic!

I found out about this service like 4 days ago and I am so excited because I've been waiting for a service like this for EVER! I placed an order on Superbowl Sunday. It took less than 20 minutes for delivery. The selection and prices are pretty good. There are a few things I would have ordered instead but weren't available, however the driver said they are still trying to determine what items people want. I will be emailing them directly about that, but all in all, great experience. I will DEFINITELY be ordering again.
