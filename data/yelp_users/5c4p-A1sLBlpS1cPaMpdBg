The mizithra was excellent as was the cheese garlic bread and for that and the ambience, I will give this place 4 stars. The Italian dressing on the side salad was gross so I'm glad I ordered the cheese bread. It's nice that the meals come with a scoop of sherbet, spumoni, or vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Cute little diner right in the middle of the neighborhood. Stopped here real quick before taking my sister to the airport. We each had a biscuit sandwich: she had the chicken and biscuit with bacon, cheese, and gravy and it was great and I had the one with chicken, honey, mustard, and pickles and it was excellent.  2 sandwiches and a coke to split was $21.

Excellent service and very fast. There's a small selection of local beers on tap, which I like and a small menu of sandwiches and salads. We had the chicken salad sandwich and the prosciutto sandwich and both came with a tiny slaw on the side. Everything was excellent. I think our bill total for the two sandwiches and 2 beers was around $40. Beers were pricey at $6 each a pint, but they are a buck or two cheaper at Happy Hour.  Sandwiches are tasty and fresh healthy ingredients.

These guys are great and super helpful!  I am just starting to get into biking and they were very helpful with everything.  They even assembled my bike rack and put it on my xterra for me and showed me how to strap my bike in.  I will be bring friends and family back to shop for their bikes here too!

WOW-how have I lived in the West Valley for 6 years and never have been to South Mountain!?!?  I took my sister for a picnic here and we ended up driving to the Summit.   What a great drive and we saw several other roads heading off in different directions that we will have to explore at a different time.  There are also some trails I would like to hike as well.  There was a Navajo woman up top selling some jewelry she made, which was very cool and I got my mom a necklace and earrings for $20. The park is free, so how can you beat this gorgeous scenery so close to downtown Phoenix?!?!  Will definitely be back!

This place is an adorable stopping point along the 17.  I love the Farmer's Market next door.  Their honey is excellent!  Pies are good, cookies are great, food is decent too.  Fun atmosphere and a good little pit stop.

What a great little find thanks to Yelp!  There were 3 of us and we had a family sized dinner salad for a little over $10 with an excellent pomegranate dressing. Then we had a large pizza - The Spicy Italian, which was awesome!  The meat was very good and the crust was excellent on the thin crust.  We will definitely be back!  Out waitress was super nice too.

I'm glad that they are now open for lunch so I could finally try it.  I wouldn't stand in line for hours for this pizza, but it's definitely good.  The brick oven crust is excellent-we had 3 different ones and the menu only offers like 7 choices, but all 3 were excellent.

I go here several times a year and absolutely love this place!  The pretzels, red cabbage, spaetzle, sauerkraut, schnitzel, you name it-and it is excellent here!  Oktoberfest is always a good time.  The staff is great.  My favorite dinner dish is the j√§ger schnitzel and my favorite lunch sandwich is the Reuben-best Reuben I've ever had.  They have a couple different German potato salads-both very good!  This place is a must try if you are near downtown Glendale.

That was fun!  This morning was the first morning I have been.  I sampled a couple things and bought lots more.  The chicken burrito was so so-kind've dry.  The different popcorns were ok-kettle corn is always good.  There were olive oils, honeys, gluten free desserts, veggies/fruits, Syrian bread-yum, and some craft booths as well.  It didn't take too long to walk it all.  I was there for about 30-45 minutes.  Nice little breakfast cages within walking distance.  I will be back.

$134 to replace 20 feet of flex tube in front yard. That fixed the leak, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  I've had a similar leak repaired before for half that cost by a landscaper.

If that's what a cheesesteak is supposed to taste like in Philly then I don't ever want to go to Philly!  This is one of the very few times that Yelp has led me astray. I only had this place bookmarked to try because it was a 4 star review. That cheesesteak was not good. Too salty, tasted like it was cooked in a sauce that should've been used for an asada burrito. With tax it came out to $7.58. What a waste!  This place is a good example of one and done!

It depends on the team you get-Terri is great and I forget the name of the girl who was teamed with her.  My second team-not so great. They ran out of stuff to clean and called me since they still had an hour left and I had a few more ideas, but after they left-I noticed they didn't even dust one of the entertainment centers!!  The shelves were caked with dust since it had been almost 3 weeks since I had last dusted.

Great food!  Excellent service!  The place is small and busy during the lunch hour, but the service is quick.  I had the chicken chimichanga, which was great.  Love the sour cream too!  The two salsas were both spicy, but good.  I had the sopapillas for dessert with honey and powdered sugar, which were also good.

The only appetizer worth getting is the volcano nachos which are excellent and huge!!  All the other appetizers are just ok.  The fajitas are decent as is the club sandwich and quesadilla, but by far the best thing on the menu is the cheeseburger in paradise!!  Drinks are pricey but good.  The atmosphere is fun as long as you are not in a hurry because they run on island time!  They are not in a rush-so if you have time to sit back an relax and enjoy the company or a game on Tv, then this is an excellent choice for a cute and fun little area in West Gate.

The last couple times I have been here, the food has gone up in price but the service and taste has declined some.  They still have a great cheeseburger and volcano nachos.  The other appetizers we had that we used to like just haven't tasted as good in recent trips.  The quesadillas had a seasoning on top that wasn't very good and the chicken was dry. The boneless chicken bites didn't have much breading.  The atmosphere is still fun, but it's a costly experience.

This place was cute and fun.  I used a groupon and went with my sister and parents when they were down here visiting for Thanksgiving.  We took the tour, which was short, cheap, and informative.  We bought a small loaf of freshly baked bread to sample some of the oils.  The lunch looked great-sandwiches and desserts, but we opted for samples and a mocha since we were headed to Mesa for lunch so we would like to come back and try some sandwiches.  It was lunchtime and there were quite a few people there.  All 4 of us purchased some Christmas gifts there so it was well worth the visit!

The pancakes would be a 5, but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so I averaged it out to a 4 star.  A very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast.  You can order just 1 if you want, perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes!!!!

Love this place and come here once a month at least!!  You have to try the hashbrown casserole as one of your sides!  They have great chicken fried chicken and pot roast!  My parents always get the chicken livers and my brother always gets the chicken n dumplins.  Desserts are great too, but you are usually too full by that time!  Portions are big!  Breakfasts are excellent too, as are salads.  Pretty much everything on the menu is great!

The staff at the counter is always super courteous when I come in and pick up a to o meal.  When we eat there, management is always visual and circulating the restaurant.  The place is always clean and the food is always good.

The 4 star review is for the pizzas.  I've had pepperoni, the special, and the 5 cheese.  All of them were excellent.  The salad and pastas I would probably go with a 3 star.  Olive Garden is better in that category in the same price range.  Their garlic bread is also really good.  There was plenty of seating for 5 of us at lunch time.  I think maybe 4 other tables were occupied at noon on a Wednesday.  Service was friendly.  We definitely will be back for more pizza and I would also like to give the sub sandwiches a try.

Tour was short, but interesting. Food is ok and beer is ok.  It's interesting to check out the local brewery scene though.  It has potential with a stage for a band setup.  Could be a nice local hangout spot on a Friday or Saturday night for those in the neighborhood.  Bottled beer that we took home was flat.

This company has proven to excel year after year. I have been a customer of theirs for several years and they have never disappointed me. I usually have them spray the inside as well as the outside twice a year and that is included in my monthly price. I forgot to unlock my gate once, and they came back out the next tie they were in the area and sprayed it then. A few years ago I had a cockroach problem outside and a few got inside and they sprayed and then came back a few weeks later and resprayed. They truly do have excellent customer service.

A hidden gem in the Southwest Valley.  We loved the ambience and cabin like feel with the mesquite wood smell.  The calamari was great, a couple people ordered the pulled pork sandwiches and loved them, all 5 of us gave thumbs up on the fries, the burger was great and the Parmesan crusted fish was also good.  I will definitely be spreading the word on this place and coming back to try more.  After looking at the pictures, I'm eager to check out happy hour :)

For Buckeye-this place is most definitely a 4 star rating!!  The place is cute-love the name and the reason behind the name.  Went here for lunch with some friends after hearing some good reviews and it was very good.  I had the Reuben sandwich on a pretzel roll, which was small but great.  The homemade chips and seasoned fries were also very good.  I saw some other sandwiches on the menu that I would also like to try.  I also hear that breakfasts are good, so I need to get there and try that as well.

This place is adorable. Great location - great lunches and the lunch prices are perfect. $9 fish tacos were definitely 5 star. The short rib sliders ($9) were good, but a bit dry so probably 3 stars. The place is great though-clean and the doors open up to the outside. Very nice. Will be back here for lunch to try the Reuben and to get the fish tacos again!

We had to drop my sister off at the airport and wanted to try something new so I launched my Yelp to see what I had bookmarked nearby and saw this. Neither my mom nor I had ever tried Peruvian food so we thought we would give this place a try. It's right on 7th street so parking in front of the small restaurant (7 tables and a few chairs at a small bar) is very limited, so if you miss it, just turn right on the first street and then take a right into the alley and park in the small lot behind the restaurant. You can also enter through doors on the back or walk around to the front.  We shared an appetizer and each got a meal and drink waters and our total bill was approximately $36.  We loved everything. I can't remember the names for each, but I'll post pics!

Probably the best sports book in Vegas.  Plenty of TVs and plenty of betting action.  The grill makes great sandwiches and fries.  We are obsessed with the Cuban sandwich and the Reuben is great too.  They also have a late night menu and on Sundays open up the theatre for an extra 1,500 seats to watch football games on 11 big screens with cheap hot dogs and beers.  Definitely the place to be for all sports action!

The beer was good; I enjoyed the first 6 beers on the menu on my flight. My two compadres had mixed drinks. The caprese appetizer was good and the fish tacos looked good.  The reason for the 2 stars is the pizza. We ordered a pepperoni pizza that was a good size, but was disgusting.  I would have rather had Chuck E. Cheese pizza!  Even a frozen Jack's pizza would have been better that this!  Come on, how does a bar/brewery/restaurant not make a decent pizza?!  I'll still come back to try something else and some more beers though.

What a cool place! I had the Margherita pizza which was spot on. My friend had a pepperoni and pineapple with Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on a wheat crust. Hers was ok, but we both liked mine better. Will try a couple different ones next time we are there! $8 for a pizza-great deal!
