By far the best boba I have ever had the melon cocoanut smoothly is amazing! The boba is cooked to perfection! And the diamond ice is so good too! I just wish they had one in Phoenix but Snoh in Phoenix is great too.

I have been going to EWC for years now. I love this place. I have four different waxing packages with this company; brows, lip, Brazilian, and underarm. I used to go to the one next to Desert Ridge. I had a great waxer there named Christine but unfortunately she parted ways with the company. After she left I decided to try out this location. It is closer to where I live and myself and friends have tried other waxers at the Desert Ridge location and were less then impressed. My first time waxing at the Camelback location I was a bit nervous because of some past experiences I have had at the other location. Judging from past experience at the end of the day I think your waxing experience rises and falls on which waxer you receive. EWC tries to tell you otherwise; that all their waxers are all equally as good due to the extensive training they receive but I have not found this to be the case.  I lucked out at this location and received a great waxer named Kelley. She is very polite and does very thorough work. She is great at shaping brows, does not leave any hair behind and the Brazilians are fairly painless (sometimes it can be very painful depending on the waxer you have and also how long you have been waxing). She also is good at keeping conversation going so you do not feel so uncomfortable during your wax.

The servers are nice and the presentation of the food was fairly sophisticated, but the actual taste of the food was disappointing. We ordered a large veriety of things and to be honest none of it was good at all. I suggest going to dinner elsewhere and just ordering drinks/desert at Tanzy aka iPics.

I used these guys back in January. I have moved a lot and most of the time I would use Two Men and a Truck and I always had issues with them either breaking my things or just very rude behavior from the movers. I thought that was normal for moving companies. My last move I decided to try a new moving company and my sister suggested Parker. I am so glad I chose this moving company and I will continue to do so for all of my future moves. His team was polite, professional, they did not look like they just got out of prison and above all they were very careful and did not break any of my belongings. I highly recommend these guys for anyone needing to move.

This place is awesome. The taro root boba is great! I also really like the taro root snow with condensed milk.

So delicious! I had the opportunity to try the Valley Girl juice last year (greens, cucumber, apple, celery, ginger, lemon, cinnamon, cayenne and honey) and I still remember how delicious it was. I think it is because they fill each drink with so many amazing ingredients. I visited the Raw Organic Juice Bar today and decided to try something new. I tried the Gladiator (coconut water, coconut meat, banana, agave, cocoa, maca, hemp seed, almond butter). It was packed with flavor yet light and refreshing.   The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their products.   I recommend this to anyone that wants a nutritious treat. You will love it.

I have been here twice now. Once for dinner and once for lunch.   The food has been exceptional both times.   The Tandoori, Butter Chicken and Dosa with dipping sauces are delicious.   The lunch buffet is tasty, fresh, very clean (unlike most that are out there) and affordable .   The staff is very polite and always helpful.   I will definitely be back.
