My recommendation is to avoid this place. Here is my experience.   The Good: I really enjoyed the atmosphere in this place. Old movie posters, natural wood etc. Small town joint feel. The fried Chicken.  Ok, that's the good.   The Not So Good: After placing our order I took a good look around and saw there was 2 other groups (1 family of 3 and 2 guys) besides us. The dad of the family had his coffee cup on his head trying to get the waitress' attention and shortly after finishing my coffee i understood his method. Very slow service, and a lack of attention by the staff. This was the experience the entire time. I ordered Scrambled Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, and Wheat toast. My friend ordered a biscuit and Chicken and Waffles. The Eggs were runny, the bacon and hash browns were room temperature when they got to me. The toast had been sitting out so long it tasted stale with the butter soaked completely through the bread. There was no evidence of toasting on the bread at all. Very dissatisfying, and completely disappointing. My Friend said the chicken was great, but when i asked about the waffles he had me take a closer look. The Waffles are EGGO waffles. Not cooked fresh. Eggo waffles. Its baffling to me why you would list this as a special when its chicken wings thrown on eggo waffles. Eggo. Seriously.   Don't plaster CHICKEN AND WAFFLES on the front of the window when you can't make any of it from scratch.
