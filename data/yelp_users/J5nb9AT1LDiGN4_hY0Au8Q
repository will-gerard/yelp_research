We brought our Sadie girl here (female boxer) to be checked out for her legs. Based on her symptoms Dr. Plummer pretty much had an idea of what she has; degenerative myelopathy. Instead of having us go through extremely expensive MRI's and xrays he suggested that the most cost effective plan would be to genetically test her for Degenerative Myelopathyuch first. This only cost a coUple hundred compared to the thousand or so it could have cost for tests that probably wouldn't have led to a diagnoses. It's nice going to a vet that understands how expensive things can get and give you options. To us it showed that they care for their patients more than bringing in another dollar.   Dr. Plummer had a wonderful bedside manner. He was sincere in his concern and examined her thoroughly, testing her reflexes as well as her eyes. He basically checked her from head to toe. He personally called me to break the terrible news about Sadie's positive test results for the disease. I felt he truly nOt only cared for Sadie and was saddened by her diagnoses but he also had concern for us. He let us know if they're was anything we needed we could always call or come in. He even offered to do check ups on Sadie over the course of her diseases progression.   The staff is also very personable, friendly and caring. Also another yelper commented on the expensive tests but anyone who owns pets knows how expensive veterinarian care can be which is why Pet insurance is available but also this office accepts Care Credit cards which for us was a lifesaver. If you're worried about cost apply for a Care Credit card. Plus they're not only good at vet offices but also at dental offices, eyes doctors, imaging and more.   Overall this is a fantastic office with wonderful staff and vets who love their furry patients as well as their humans. If We ever need their assistance in the future for Neuro vet care we'll come here first.

I really love Sakana! I've been here 4 or 5 times now and every time it's a sure win. Everything you get here is wonderful but the baked scallop is one of my favorites. It's topped with a ton of crab with some sort of sweet sauce, maybe a mayo of some sort, and tons a little scallops. So delicious! They have a great selection of rolls to choose from; classics like the Vegas, Philly and Rainbow rolls and then some specialty ones like their scallop roll and the Sahara Rainbow roll, which is really spicy! Service is always friendly and the food never takes too long. They have a teppanyaki area too which I still haven't done because I love their sushi too much, so I can't vouch for that but eventually I'll try it! This is a definite must try sushi place.

Oh hell...we won't be going back! lol   After having an amazing dinner at San Tan Brewery where we sat outside and enjoyed our night we decided to splurge and have dessert somewhere else for some added fun to our evening. So we thought, "Hey let's try The Melting Pot." I had been a few years prior and thought it was completely over priced and not at all worth what you pay but my hubby had never been so I wanted him to have that fondue experience.  We got there about 40 minutes before they closed and they immediately sat us in this claustrophobic little booth...thing. The last time I had been there I was with a party and we sat in a regular dining area. Yes this little booth was intimate but it really doesn't do them any favors. By having such little space and a closed curtain you start analyzing everything around your small area. Like how there was food splattered and stuck to the wall. Or how the wood along the wall had been essentially burned away over time from the heat coming off the fondue pots. Or how there was a HUGE uneven crack in the middle of our table. Everything just seemed outdated and grimy. After a few minutes our server came and asked for the drink orders. My hubby ordered an Irish coffee and I just wanted water. He asked me if I wanted one of the two sparkling waters they carried or "tap water". I told him tap water was fine and when he made a face I asked, "Well is it filtered water?" after he said yes I kind of just stared at him with a face like, "okay and your issue is...?" He just walked away. lol I'm sorry but I'm not going to pay your outrageous price for water, it's ridiculous, plus I'm not a fan of sparkling water. I'm perfectly fine with filtered water and this guy was trying to make it out as if I just ordered some unfiltered swamp water or something. Seriously, get over yourself. So I got my undesirable "tap water" and my hubby got his coffee. The yin-yang chocolate was brought out with the dippers and we were pretty disappointed. The cheesecake looked and tasted exactly like Wal-Mart's cheesecake, the brownies were so sugary sweet I could barely get my one piece down, the marshmallows were stale, and the bananas had brown spots on them! Although, the pound cake (I believe it was), the strawberries and the rice crispy treats were okay but it was an extremely small portion and way over priced, just like it was a few years ago.   After we were finishing up my hubby still needed to finish his coffee and the server brought out the check...and then started clanking glasses, vacuuming, loudly shouting to others, laughing, and talking about inapproprate coworker drama. The place went from quiet to very noisy in a matter of a couple minutes. Apparently waiting to clean the restaurant until all the guests have left isn't something they train the staff on. It was extremely rude.  All in all I'm glad we went ONLY so that my hubby could have that experience, which he didn't like, so we won't be back. Don't waste your money when you can easily buy some good quality chocolate, melt it at home, and enjoy it with fresh fruits and other dipping pieces of your choice.

A great deal more happened since my last review and you can see I did up it by one star. After my last review an employee from The Melting Pot decided to privately contact me and was rude towards myself and my review as well as made some snide remarks towards myself and my boyfriend. This really upset me so I contacted The Melting Pot's management and worked with the Area Manager, Kelly Cooper. Kelly was extremely helpful, and offered us a free dinner for the trouble we went through.   Last night we took up the offer and arrived on time for our reservation. I requested for a table in the main dinning area, rather than one of the private booths. I never considered myself someone uncomfortable in small spaces but I really didn't like the private booths the last time we were there. The booth and area seemed very clean and much more comfortable this time around. Our server was extremely personable and courteous the entire evening. Everything came out promptly and we were able to dine just under the two hour mark. I've seen others complain about how long it takes to dine here but that's really just part of the experience. Plus my boyfriend and I can sit and talk for hours so we were fine with it.  The food was...okay. We had the spinach artichoke dip, which honestly was bland. We LOVE spinach artichoke dips and this was the worst one we've experienced. It lacked flavor; it needed more spices or even some kick with jalapenos. We had the Coq Au Vin broth for the entree and again it didn't really give the food much flavor at all. Our meal wasn't awful but it wasn't amazing either. As stated in my previous review I've been to The Melting Pot before and remembered how my entire family felt the food didn't match the large price you paid. I still feel the same, I dont think the food has really improved and maybe its because you're cooking it yourself. For example, we really love beef at medium rare, which you can't really do here especially since you're mixing meats and everything needs to be cooked all the way through. We love veggies steamed or roasted and well seasoned but that's not how its cooked. Without the different dipping sauces the food tastes pretty plain. It's just boiled meats and veggies, and after the boiling process the meats come out over cooked for our taste, and the veggies just seemed so boring. Also one thing I noticed, the mushrooms weren't washed; they still had that dark soil-dirt all over them. So for each one I was trying to brush off the dirt before putting them in the broth. For our dessert we chose the s'more chocolate and opted to take out the brownies, cheesecake, and marshmallows, and had them add extra of everything else. Those three treats are just way too sweet to be dipped in chocolate; the sweet chocolate is more balanced by less sweet items like the fruit, pound cake, and surprisingly, the rice krispies treats.  We had a good enough time, so why is there still a low star rating? Well just under an hour after we left we both became extremely ill. I'm not exactly sure why because we followed our servers instructions by letting the meats boil for at least 2 minutes and sometimes our pieces ended up boiling longer while we had some of the veggies. Also, we didn't touch any of the raw meats to our plates either. So, we spent all last night in and out of the bathroom. Not exactly how we wanted to spend our Friday night. After some light research on Google I did find quite a few reviews on other sites, blog posts, and forum comments about people getting food poisoning from The Melting Pot.  So needless to say, this will be our last visit. After the previous bad experiences, having employees angrily contacting me, and now food poisoning we're not planning on going back. The only reason I upped the star rating is because the manager, Kelly, was so understanding with my complaints and took my concerns seriously.

We were sat and started looking at the menu but realized everything was breakfast. Once our server came over with a couple waters we asked for a lunch menu and were told lunch doesn't start until noon. Seriously no lunch until noon? We have the kind of work schedule where we're up super early so lunch time is at 11AM. Plus most places serve lunch starting at 11AM, some even start at 10:30AM. This was enough to make us leave and go to CK's Tavern instead. This was very disappointing as we were looking forward to giving them a try. Maybe next time...

We finally came here for dinner but we were disappointed. There wasn't alot to choose from and it's quite expensive. The service was fine and the food was pretty decent but we expected a very different menu and a larger one at that. Plus their prices were way too much. I doubt we'd be back.

Came here today to get everything I needed to dye my hair and the associate that helped was great! I've only dyed my hair once and it was almost a year ago so I needed a refresher on everything.  She helped me pick out everything I needed, gave me some great info and tips, and now I feel confident on dying my own hair again!

MmmMm! I love this place. They have wonderful food. Although if you come here during a lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait because this place gets super busy and crowded but it's so worth the wait.  I got their tacos and some chips and salsa and guacamole. Omg, so delicious. I can't wait for the chandler location to open so I can try them for lunch when I'm working, yay!! Also I absolutely love the art work they did to the inside, it's very SoCal and makes me feel like I'm back in San Diego. Very very good, I will keep coming back!

Seriously what is it with furniture salesmen, they're just like car salesmen! So we're looking for a few pieces and have been store hopping. Against my better judgement we went to look in the Room Store. The sales guy was all over us. He said he'll let us look around and he'll check on us later but he's literally following us. Any time we stop to slightly glance at a piece of furniture he quickly comes over to tell us all about the piece. Go away! If I need help I will ask for it. I really hate furniture shopping at these types of stores. The sales people are ridiculously annoying and they sell all the same cheap crap...which you can buy online for even cheaper btw (Amazon, Overstock, Wayfair, Hayneedle). So after about 15 minutes we were done. I'd had enough and we left. Won't return, hopefully...you know when you're hungry but you have nothing to eat in your kitchen but you keep randomly checking your fridge or pantry like something new is going to appear, that's how I am with these damn stores. I always hope for better furniture, and better service but it's always the same bs.

I was calling around for break pad/rotor prices and called this shop based on the good reviews. I told the gentleman on the phone that I have an 2008 Mazda 6 and its a 4 cylinder. He then told me there is no such thing as a 4 cylinder in a Mazda 6  that's why it's called a Mazda 6 because it's a 6 cylinder. I told him he was incorrect it was a 4 cylinder. He told me I was incorrect. I said, "Okay thanks anyhow". I then called Mazda  in Mesa where I bought my car,  thinking I have been wrong for 5 years. They laughed and said, "Nope that's just the model name, it has nothing to do with the cylinders." So when should you not go to an auto shop? When you know more than they do.

Food is always consistent and tastes decent. Service is kind of blah. The place is kind of dirty and this includes the appearance of the employees. Eh...but its cheap and you get what you pay for.

I am really quite surprised at the high reviews for this establishment. They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.  When we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant!   It took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water.   Needless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!

This is where my boyfriend and I go if we want good Chinese. Its hard to find decent Chinese in Arizona in the first place but this restaurant is actually pretty good. Plus we like the buffet style when it comes to Chinese so we can try different items. Their buffet is always stocked up, there is a lot to choose from and its pretty tasty. The staff is friendly every time we go and the place is CLEAN! Too many times we've been to some buffets that are outright disgusting. My boyfriend who is allergic to shell fish likes it because he can order tuna rolls and there has never been an issue with cross contamination which is so nice because we've gone to some upscale restaurants and have had issues! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do feel it should be a couple dollars cheaper per person but since its always been so good we'll continue to make this our Chinese restaurant of choice.

The Good: So this place has excellent yogurt. Its creamy, never gritty, and the flavors are fun and forever changing. I have been going here for nearly 15 years and I'm never disappointed in the yogurt. Its wonderful!  The Bad: This is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. First, they only take cash. I'm someone who never carries cash so it makes it inconvenient to have to remember to bring some. Second, no longer do you see the family members working there with their friendly faces but instead are these high school teens that don't care about their job and talk about their high school drama instead of showing some courtesy to the customers. Lastly they don't have a lot of toppings to choose from and I feel they're a bit pricey so I never get them.  For years I refused to get yogurt anywhere else because MFY was sooo good I didn't like any other shops but alas I have ventured and found other great places that are doing a better job at creating creamy yogurt. I'll still go there every so often when I'm in the area but nowadays I seem to like other places a bit better but its still very much worth a try.   FYI, they're not open on Sundays! I used to always forget about that!

Ha! I haven't been here in y.e.a.r.s! But my BF decided to take me out to lunch because I was having a sad day (I had to give away my puppy to a friend....my older dog was jealous and the puppy wouldn't stop nipping at him and he kept eating the furniture {I tried for over a year to train him!}) and he thought old school Fuddruckers would cheer me up. It was pretty much how I remembered it from middle school. The burgers were pretty decent and the fries were okay too. I liked how they had a ton of different sauces to choose from for your burgers and fries but it didn't really like the open area of lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc... it looked clean but kids with their germy kid hands were touching the toppings and it kind of grossed me out a little. I wish all burgers just came with those toppings on the side so no one else is touching your food but I get weird with stuff like that. I got the regular burger with swiss and mushrooms and he had an elk burger, both were cooked to order. It was a lot of food and neither of us could finish everything. Overall we had a good experience and it did cheer me up!

We decided to try this place for lunch today and it was okay at best. Its nothing special. Its similar to Elmer's Tacos or Someburro's but I would actually prefer one of those places over this Los Favoritos. Their red hot sauce was odd because I could taste no flavor just the onset of a spiciness. The rice was moist, which was good, and the refried beans were fine. Nothing was awful it just wasn't anything to rave about. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. But since I prefer the tastes of the places listed above I probably won't be back.

Wanted to give this place another try and again they failed me. I ordered a soft flour carne asada taco and got a soft corn taco instead and I actually really hate the soft corn tortillas. I also got chips and guacamole. If you love guacamole and are a snob about it like me don't get their guacamole. It's some sort of bland, cheap green stuff. And then they throw raw shredded cheese on it... Ugh. Sorry Someburros, I should have listened to my guy and drove over to you instead. Waste of money. Oooh and that's another thing!! A small drink, a taco and chips and guacamole was $12!!!! Rip off.

I've been going to Kona basically since they opened, mainly at the Scottsdale location but now we live in Chandler.  Their Macadamia Nut Chicken is amazing!!! Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite dish ever. We also love their sushi. They have many rolls to choose from and the traditional rolls are priced well. I do think the specialty rolls are a bit pricey but they taste so wonderful I'm willing to deal with it.  We went to this location last week and everyone was very willing to make sure there was no cross contamination since my BF is allergic to shellfish. The head chef came out and talked to us. He was very accommodating and explained that the rolls are made in the morning, so there could be cross contamination but he was happy to break down a section to prepare our rolls on fresh surfaces with freshly cleaned utensils. My BF had a very small reaction but nothing the Benadryl couldn't correct. (I have since emailed Kona asking them to prepare their shellfish rolls and non shellfish rolls separately.) Even with a slightly puffy lip my boyfriend and I enjoyed it so much!  The main reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the prices but we'll keep going back!

We had come here a handful of times since moving in down the street. I signed up for the eclub they have online and got a coupon for a special price on bowling but it was only for specific times and only during Mon - Fri. So we came in on a Friday, the last day of the coupon, and only had an hour left to bowl. For us that was perfect. Well when I gave the coupon to the girl at the desk she told me they couldn't do that tonight because they were using 8 lanes for leaguers. Ummm, ok, what about your other 20-some lanes available? We were really upset that they wouldn't honor their own coupon due to a couple leagues coming in! Your leagues are not the only place you receive revenue. Your non league bowlers should be given the same courtesy and respect. Obviously here we're not. She was extremely rude and the manager was standing right there and didn't say anything so obviously he didn't care. So I emailed AMF, which I'm pretty sure it didn't go to any corporate office, it was directed back to the people who run this location. The response I got was this, "So what do you want?" Seriously!!?!!! Never mind then! I never wrote back and we''ll never be going back. Brunswick will be getting our dollars from now on.

We have been here a few times and it's pretty darn good! Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable of the food. I love their prime rib and crab while my boyfriend's loves the baseball cut steak. We're going here for Valentine's next week so we're excited to return!

What a disappointment...   We were craving delicious, juicy burgers and what we got were burgers that were dried out, tasteless, and way overcooked. This is due to the cooks pressing on the burgers while they cook, and either not knowing or not caring what temperature they end up being. And my bacon was black, seriously, completely burnt. Those burgers are not worth $12 a piece. The fries weren't seasoned, they were awfully bland. The only thing that tasted good was my coke.  Also, Yelpers talked about Teakwoods having live music and the server said they've gotten lazy and never book bands anymore, and have actually taken the event calendar down. I don't see us going back. My generous two star rating is for the atmosphere; I liked the upbeat bar feel it has.

My BF and I came here last night with my parents and really liked it. Three of us had the Best Chicken sandwich and the other had the Tower Burger. Everything tasted pretty good. I'll admit that my chicken sandwich wasn't AWESOME by any means, but it was pretty good. I opted for the caprese pasta salad instead of the kettle chips but it was a bit bland; next time I'll try the potato salad instead.   The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was great. I felt we were a lucky table because we got to sit outside where it was a little quieter then inside, plus the weather was wonderful.   For now I'll leave the rating at 4 stars because I want to go back and try some of their other selections but all in all it was a great night and we're looking forward to going back!

Just like with the Crowded House in Chandler, I love the Potato Barn. I think they're sister stores or something. I love all the unique pieces that you won't find in places like the room store or mor furniture. I always go to these two stores before anywhere else. And it's a huge plus to not have sales people following your around.

I really needed my brows waxed since we're going on vacation in a few days; gotta get those things tamed! I always get really nervous with new people waxing my eye brows. Too many times I've left a place with odd shaped brows or half of one missing. Ugh so frustrating... Based on all the great yelp reviews I called Judy's and made an appointment and I'm sooo glad I did! Pamela did an excellent job, she's an experienced professional. She was friendly, made me feel comfortable but was also quick. After the appointment the woman at the front desk gave me a pamphlet of their other services so I plan on checking out the facials and the acupuncture.   Also, don't let the outside of the building fool you. It's an older building for sure but they definitely put love into the inside with updated furniture, new paint and brightly colored art on the walls. I love that it smells like essential oils too (I'm an aromatherapist, lol).  I'll definitely be back and would highly recommend this business!

Based on all the high reviews on Yelp I decided to give this place a try to have my eye brows waxed. The place was extremely outdated, I waited for 20 minutes before anyone helped me, and I just felt very uncomfortable being there. The lady who waxed my brows was pleasant enough but it doesn't make up for my terrible experience.   When she was done I told her that my right eye brow looked a bit longer then the other and she insisted that the left brow looked longer, so she shortened it more!! She also asked if I ever break out after getting my brows waxed and I told her that I never do. She then put something on my brows to "help with my breaking out" even though I just told her that I never break out from waxing. Without asking she rubbed something onto the skin on and around my brows that smelled strongly of alcohol and started burning. I told her it was burning and her only reaction was "Oh...that's odd." She didn't attempt to wipe off whatever it was that she put on my skin. Once I got home and looked in the mirror I had to correct and shorten the right brow to match the left one that she messed up. Also within a couple hours for the first time EVER, after 15 years of getting my brows waxed, I started breaking out!!! So I had to apply coconut oil, lavender and tea tree essential oils to the areas for a week to heal the skin.   I will never ever go back to this place and recommend you look else where for waxing. In addition, it isn't very professional to advertise on your website that the Brazilian waxing you offer includes "up the butt". Really? They couldn't have found a more professional and tactful way to say that?

Oh what an enormous disappointment... I grew up coming here. I remember my mom taking me here as a kid and they had the best fajitas. I decided to try them again for the first time in 15 years and I was so excited and then so incredibly let down. The first thing I noticed was the decor. It literally hasn't changed in the last 15 20 years. It's completely outdated. Next was the price. Are you kidding me? $30+ for fajitas!??? The owner has got to be out of his mind to charge that amount. I have never in my life seen fajitas so expensive. Literally double of any other restaurant. It's completely unacceptable. I should have walked out right then but my BF convinced me to stay and we'll just share an order so we can at least try them. Soooo- incredibly not worth it. Not at all. The shrimp were tiny, the steak was well over cooked, the tortillas were very small and they only gave us three even though we were sharing. We asked for more but was told it would cost extra. There was barely enough food for one person let alone two. The chips and salsa were okay and because of their overpriced ridiculousness we only had water, which tasted dirty, so it was tap water, not filtered. I would never go back here. I was so saddened by what has happened to this place. A place that used to be beyond popular is now a place to avoid. Lower your prices by half, up your quality and quantity and maybe we'd return. There are many other places that are way better in price, quality and quantity then this place, so don't bother.

I can't believe I've never written a yelp review for the AZ Ren Fair before. I've been coming here off and on since I was a kid. It's definitely a lot of fun especially if you've never been.   They have tons of interesting shops that carry all sorts of wacky and fun souvenirs. There are also quite a few shops that have costumes so if you want to dress up, you can. They have shows like the Ded Bob Show and the Tortuga Twins who are more for adults and they have shows like Barely Balanced, Adam Crack and the jousting which are great for everyone. They also have mini entertainments without an official stage, like the woman who just sits and plays requested songs on her harp. The food is really good too. Best smoked turkey legs and giant chocolate covered strawberries anywhere. The chocolate milkshake is amazing and we always have to get a corn on the cob.  This place isn't cheap though. For two adults without kids who get food off and on during the day, multiple drinks to stay hydrated in the Arizona sun, a few souvenirs, plus tickets and gas to get there we spend about $150. You don't realize how much things add up.  The only thing that's a bit disappointing is nothing ever changes. Not the shows (not even their material), not the shops, or location of shops, not the food, nothing. Its nearly identical every year.  We've decided that we'll skip the next year or two in hopes of maybe some change or at least give us a chance to miss it. We've gone 4 years in a row because my boyfriend had never been to anything like this before. We really do love it but when we went just a couple weeks ago for their opening weekend we didn't even show up until 11:00am and we left around 4:00pm because we got bored. So hopefully by skipping a couple years will reignite our love for this fun fair.

We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. Personally we didn't try any of the food because we had eaten earlier. The servers were nice, but my best friend's husband complained that the drink he ordered was terrible (it was, we all took a sip; it tasted like cough syrup) but the server didn't really didnt seem surprised or remove the drink until my friend's husband gave it to her. Also through the process of serving all the sushi dishes they couldn't remember who had which ones, and which was which; there was a few minutes of confusion. We're not supposed to know which sushi is which, the servers are. There also was some inconsistencies with the wasabi. Some were so mild you could barely taste anything, while the others were so spicy that it brought tears to your eyes. No one made complaints on any of the sushi itself. However based on what I saw, I know I've had way better. We also took a look at the menu, and their prices are outrageous. I truly think RA is more of a trendy thing, like Starbucks...people just seem to go here because of the name. We'll just stick to our regular place for sushi.

We're so done with this place.  Years ago Gordon's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on Mill Ave, or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun. Now Gordon's is a place full of constant disappointments. A couple months ago we went to the Gordon's in San Tan Village and we were served cold, tasteless food. A month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again. This time I wrote to Gordon's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits, and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another try.  Today we visited the Mill Ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards I wished we hadn't gone. We sat in the self seating area near the bar. Our server was very standoffish and you could tell he didn't want to be there at all. He brought us our soda's and took our order but he didn't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides. While waiting for our food I noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them!! I grabbed another server who was walking by and told her. She apologized and took the glasses. A few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said, "Well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it's okay." Are you effing kidding me!? Finally the food came and just like the San Tan Village location the food was cold, and absolutely tasteless. We finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left.   Seriously, if you're looking for a fabulous burger, great beer, excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please take the time and go to the San Tan Brewery which is in Chandler off of Arizona Ave and Chandler Blvd in the old town area. You won't be disappointed! As my dad would say, they could sell their burgers in India they're so good. http://www.santanbrewing.com/ However, if you're in Tempe and don't want to drive all the way to Chandler (and okay with fighting for parking) try Four Peak's Brewery, they're also fantastic.  http://www.fourpeaks.com/

We came here based on a couple of recommendations. When we walked in no one greeted us they just looked at us. The place was old and dumpy looking. Finally a lady grabbed a couple menus and just walked away without saying anything. We followed, assuming she was seating us. She slide the menus onto the table and walked away again, squeezing between us. It was extremely rude and awkward. We sat down, and gave our drink order to the asking server. Upon opening our menu we didn't see a lot of meals, more like separate items. It was odd. In addition, the prices seemed outrageous; $9 for two eggs and a couple pieces of bacon!? That's ridiculous! $8 for a couple pieces of French toast!? After seeing the crazy prices, along with the disrespectful hostess, we weren't impressed, we left. Instead we went to Mill Ave right down the street and had an amazing breakfast at the NCOUNTER.

I have seen so many great shows here; Iliza Schlesinger, Felipe Esparza, Ari Shaffir and Nikki Glaser. I love how if you sign up to be a member they'll call you randomly and offer free tickets sometimes. That's pretty neat. That's how we ended up seeing Nikki Glaser. The shows are fun and really no matter where you sit you'll be able to enjoy the show. However, the cost of the drinks, holy moly are they super expensive. It's always a two drink minimum and boy do they add up quick. The first time we went we ordered some fun alcoholic beverages and with our four drinks and a tip it was over $70!!! That's insane. So from then on we only get a couple waters or soda. We've never eaten dinner here but we have tried their chocolate cake and it's really good and I don't usually like cake much. Service can be a bit spotty though depending on how busy it gets. However, I would keep coming back but I now know not to get any alcohol drinks here.

This QT is hopping! Tons of people here all trying to get some gas and grab some lunch. They have a ton of gas pumps but it's never enough. I got lucky today, woot! Their service is fast and friendly. I tried their new kitchen and got a slice of pizza. It was pretty darn good for gas station pizza. Lol Too bad when our office moves to Chandler in May I'll have to find another QT. You rock QT.

Sometimes you just have to be the odd ball out I guess. I have eaten at Chuck Box about 5, maybe 6 times and I have tried  both the burgers and the chicken sandwich. I truly don't understand the hype. It's okay but nothing spectacular. However, the onion rings are fantastic!  The staff is usually rude, I've only been once where I think someone was pleasant. The burgers aren't cooked to order. The condiments are all sitting out and for some reason it bothers me. Don't know why really, it just looks...off...like I can see people waiting in line and I get this irrational idea that people are just standing there...breathing on everything. I don't know! Also the reason for a two star verses three star review is that they don't take debit or credit cards but instead have a lovely little ATM that is expensive. It's 2013, almost 2014 actually, stop taking a stand or making whatever statement you're trying to make and just get a card machine.

I had been here a couple of times while I went to school at SWIHA across the street. What a waste. I'm not really sure why people drive around with Pete's Fish & Chips bumper stickers and why people rave about it, or why anyone would give this place more than 2 stars because it's awful. Absolutely awful!  First off, it's over priced for what you get and you're getting frozen food! NOTHING is made fresh. You get frozen square pieces of fish, frozen shrimp, frozen fries, frozen, frozen, frozen. You'd be better off going to your grocery store, buying it cheaper there and cooking it at home. It's sad when Long John's Silver's actually beats out someone in fish and chips. Plus even after they cook they're frozen fish squares it doesn't taste good. Its greasy and bland. Also the red sauce...yeah it's gross. I wanted tarter sauce and was told no.  Second, service is appalling! Why are they so damn rude? The people servicing are disrespectful and always love shutting the little screen door in your face. They also don't accept credit cards, or debit cards. Really? Come on, catch up! The first time I came here I had to leave and go to Wendy's because I don't carry cash. So I had to try again another time, That was my first experience. There is no excuse to not accept cards nowadays; Geez, you can accept cards on smart phones, it's that easy!!!  Lastly, hygiene. Ugh...gawd...gross. This place has got to be breaking alot of health codes. Their staff looks dirty, they constantly handle money with the same gloves they use to prepare food. Plus, I have seen staff go on cigarette breaks using the same gloves they use to prepare food.  Just take your business elsewhere. Just listen to the majority of the people who have given reviews, most of them are NOT good because this place is terrible.

I had to run out of the office to fill my gas tank and across the street was The Original Hoagie Shop. I decided to give them a try since it was convenient. I even quickly checked their Yelp rating and saw the 4 star rating, so I felt it was a safe bet.  The place was quite small and a bit dingy feeling. I didn't smell anything, which was surprising. I guess I was expecting to smell either baked bread, or the spices from the different hot sandwiches they offer, or something. I wanted to leave but felt I didn't have much time to go elsewhere so I stayed and ordered the cheese steak sandwich. Most places that offer cheese steak sandwiches usually have onions so I was surprised to find out I would need to add them on. I paid and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally! I got my sandwich and I headed back to work since I was running behind now.  When I got back to work is when I realized they charged me extra for mushrooms but they didn't bother to let me know there would be an up charge for it. The total came to $8.18, I thought whatever, as long as it tastes good I'll be fine with it.  I was very disappointed. The sandwich was absolutely flavorless! No tomato, or lettuce, no mayo, or malt vinegar, nothing was on it. It was just cooked chopped meat, with a little bit of onions, a few mushrooms pieces, and some cheese. This was not worth the money, not even close. I am so disappointed I wasted my money...  I definitely won't be back, I didn't think it was worth the $8 bucks by any means. I would suggest going to Forefather's Cheese Steaks off of Priest and Warner. They're flavorful, they have lots of options to choose from, very clean place with happy staff. For the price I paid for JUST a sandwich by itself I could have gotten a sandwich, fries, and a drink at Forefathers. How sad is that!?

DISGUSTING!!! I can't even believe there are actually people who have given this place more then one star. I would give it zero stars if I could.  My boyfriend and I decided to try it. Whenever we have chinese we always go to Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet in Ahwatukee because its very good! Arizona is a hard place to find decent chinese food but we decided to take a risk and we lost!  After paying, we were seated and the table was filthy. There was actually food splattered on the short wall that divded the booths. We went to find plates and there were none. We stood around for about 5 or 7 minutes until someone brought a few out. After walking around I could only find 3 or 4 things that looked decently edible. There really wasn't much to choose from and I was distracted by the dirty floors, walls, and food stations, that I couldn't really think about anything else. When we sat to eat I took one bite and nearly spit my food out. It was absolutely rancid! I washed my mouth out with my soda and watched my boyfriend make faces at his plate while pushing his food around with his fork.  I glanced down and there was a thick black hair laying across the table. I'd had enough! We got up and demanded our money back. They tried to say we ate everyhing on our plates and I had to explain that our plates were not full because we didn't fill our plates up to begin with! Then they tried to keep the money for the sodas. I pointed out that they were full glasses of soda sitting there and I want ALL my money back. After telling the lady I wasn't leaving without my money, I finally got my full amount back. We left and went to Chompies in Chandler for some delicious food in a clean atmosphere.  If you want some pretty good chinese that's buffet style, try Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet in Ahwatukee. It's off of Chandler Blvd just east of 48th Street.  Seriously this place has tons to choose from, its tasty, has great service, and very clean. This is where we always go and where we should have gone that night.

We went here last night for the first time and really liked it! My boyfriend got the orange chicken, and I had the walnut shrimp. Both meals were very flavorful, cooked well, were great portions, and also reheated nicely the next day. For some reason I really liked their fortune cookies too. I know it sounds like an odd thing to mention but I did! I usually never eat them but their fortune cookies had a homemade taste to them! We will absolutely be going back!

I'm not going to go into a detailed review of the acts because I don't want to give anything away but I'll just say it was okay. I thought it would be way better. Had I not gotten half off tickets through my work I would have been a little upset about the price. I'll be honest, towards the end both my boyfriend and I seriously had to fight to keep our eyes open. I think that we were too tired from the long day we'd had on strip, plus we expected more sleight of hand and magic tricks then what they preformed. Actually they were more making fun of people who perform "magic" then anything. They also kept going on political rants. Guys, it's Vegas, lighten up. We're here to relax not get irritated by the world we live in on our vacation. Also I didn't like how they kept turning the lights off and on, and off and on when picking audience members to participate. It was very distracting. Additionally they should add some monitors so you can better see the actual act.  Lastly,  with the amount of time they spent setting up for the acts (just lots of talking) didn't leave much time to do many tricks. I'm glad we saw them to say that we went and had that experience but I probably wouldn't repurchase tickets.

I have been to the Rainforest Cafe quite a few times over the years and it's never that good. The hostess was creepy. Lol She got into our bubble of space to ask how many for our table. We both sort of stepped back and she stepped forward. She needs to learn space boundaries. We got to our table and ordered. Our sever was a bit obnoxious, nothing in particular, he was just kind of annoying. The food was blah. The menu itself is boring and like any other boring restaurant. You'd think that they'd have more fun or exotic recipes being that it's the Rainforest Cafe but nope, they had a few sandwiches, some salads, a few burgers, some fish items, etc... pretty boring. If it hadn't been for the free gift card we had we probably wouldn't be back. Go elsewhere. There are plenty of places that are far better. Rainforest Cafe is more interested in the environment they provide than the food they serve.

This place was pretty neat! I loved the décor. We came here one night for sushi and it was pretty good. Not amazing but good enough. Service was friendly and the environment was fun and clean. I'd like to try their burgers, since they seem so popular. And their fries come in these little cute shopping carts! Lol I'd definitely go back for another try.

We had a wonderful time! I saw this show 4 years ago and loved it as much this time as I did back then. Absolutely stunning! Would watch this again and again! This is a good show to start with if you've never seen a cirque show before. It's very whimsical! I'm looking forward to the next time we're in Vegas so we can see KA, or O.

We got very lucky with the wait as there were only a handful of people in front if us.  The atmosphere was whimsical. It's beautifully decorated with flowers and bright colors, really stunning. I wish we were sat in that center area with all the flowers but it's okay maybe next time.  I actually thought there would be a bit more to choose from but of the items I did try were quite good. I had the prime rib, sausage, lime corn, potatoes and a few other items that were quite tasty. I also tried the crab legs. I had wished they were freshly steamed and hot like at Caesars Bacchanal Buffet. I thought they were...ok but not great.  The desserts were also really good. There was alot to choose from and everything we tasted was delicious.   We would likely go back as it was pretty good. I just wish, being that it's The Wynn, there was a bit more to choose from, and that their crab legs were served hot instead of on ice.

We had a great time here. Food was excellent, prices were a bit high but you're getting higher quality, service was great and the environment was very nice. We sat outside at night, very pleasant. We'd definitely come back.

So here's the deal. We came here for breakfast and it wasn't great.  The service: It was terrible. I could not get a server to refill our waters and orange juice to save my life, and what we were given was warm. I hate warm water, soda, juice, milk, even coffee. I like my drinks ice cold, so that bothered me.   The food: Eh... it was okay. It was not worth the $25 per person cost, that's for sure.  Several types of eggs and potatoes along with bacon, sausage, mini French toasts, mini pancakes, croissants, muffins, bagels, fruit, etc... is what they had.  I think the only reason to come here and pay this price is if you plan on eating several full plates, which we didn't. We didn't eat that much at all because it was mediocre at best.  EXCEPTION!!!!! The one exception is I did decide to try a crepe.  I got the #1 which was nutella with bananas, hazelnuts, and whipped cream. Okay, this thing was f*****g Delicious!!  With a capital D. It's the only reason I'm giving the two star rating. However, I'm sure you can find a restaurant that is much cheaper and get a wonderful crepe.  Also, after we left my boyfriend started feeling really sick and had to make several trips to the bathroom throughout the day. So while the crepes were good we'd never come back due to price, blah food, and the fact that my boyfriend got pretty sick.

I was really craving some Asian noodles, so after seeing the Blue Man Group we headed over to give this place a try. We waited about 25 minutes, which isn't too bad.   Our server was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was decorated to fit the theme and was very inviting.  I ordered the wonton soup with thin rice noodles, and the boyfriend ordered the chicken soup with flat rice noodles. The prices were pretty decent, about $15 per person for what we ordered.   Our dishes came quite quickly but to our disappointment they tasted pretty bland. We let our server know and she brought over some soy sauce, chili sauce, and some salt and white pepper. After adding in the seasonings the soups were delicious! My boyfriend's chicken was moist and tender, and the shrimp wantons in my soup were wonderful!  We would definitely come back here next time we're in Vegas!

We came here for dinner the other night and we weren't overly impressed and, honestly, I'm quite surprised by some of the higher reviews.   The atmosphere was fine; low lighting, decently decorated, but it was much smaller than I had expected. It was also nearly empty when we first got there at 6pm.  Service was decent; a couple of the servers were hard to understand but we got by. Now, I understand the whole concept of how the servers will keep coming with the meat  until you turn over the little colorful toy looking thing but it was a bit distracting to have a conversation when the servers are circling around you and interrupting. Maybe it would be better to just bring out a dish of the samplings and if you want more then you could ask for it.  The salad bar was...okay. It wasn't anything to rave about. I tried a sampling of six different salads; mushrooms, tilapia and tomatoes, chicken salad, egg salad, crab salad, and garbanzo bean salad. Of the six I thought two of them were good; chicken salad and egg salad.  After we finished with the salads they started bringing in the meats. Again, we thought they were okay. The beefs were definitely way better than the others. I liked the prime rib, the sirloin, and the fillet, however they were a bit over cooked for my taste but they were seasoned well and moist. Although, the sausage was dry, the ham was so-so, the pork chop was completely dried out, the lamb I didn't care for, and the piece of rib I got didn't really have any meat on it. They also brought rice, beans, some other sauce, and a small dish of fried banana's. I didn't try the beans or whatever the sauce was but I did try the rice. It was plain, nothing exciting, plus it was slightly undercooked; I got a few crunchy pieces. The fried banana's were really good though.  We had the flan for dessert, it was actually really good. Keep in mind though, flan is pretty easy to make, but it was tasty.  I think that it's a great concept and would be an enjoyable experience if the quality was better. While I'm glad we at least tried it, because it's always good to try something new, I doubt we'll ever be back. The price we paid wasn't worth it. Unless they lowered their price to $20 a person, I probably wouldn't come back. I think it would be a better idea to take your money to one of your favorite steakhouses.  Now I was going to give this restaurant a 2, maybe 3, star rating however, after reading other reviews and seeing how the manager of Brazilian Bull responded to negative reviews I changed it to a 1 star rating.  Tip to the manager: if you want people to return after a bad experience, being rude, disrespectful and extremely defensive is not the way to do it. Being argumentative and trying to prove a point won't help your restaurant and you should keep in mind "word of mouth" is a powerful tool. Learn some customer service and common courtesy.

Very cool, but there is a good reason for the one star. Read below...  Being that both my boyfriend and I are part of the medical community we are fascinated by the human body. These types of exhibits are an excellent way to understand what makes you tick! As far as this particular bodies exhibit it was okay. A bit boring compared to the original Body Worlds but pretty cool.  However, there was an older woman who works there wouldn't leave us alone. She kept going from room to room explaining something when we didn't ask for an explanation. Being that we probably knew more about the human body then she did, it was starting to annoy us. We just wanted the quiet so we could enjoy the exhibit and what was in front of us.  Also, about 6 years ago I visited the original Body Worlds. It was much more exciting and allowed viewers to see not only humans but animals as well. It was much more interactive and they showed you the entire process they go through to create one perfectly preserved body. Also they used many different races as well as both genders equally. This exhibit in the Luxor seems to be using mostly Asian men, and it made us suspicious of why.  (Reason for my one star review!) I did some research and found its possible these bodies are prisoners from China who were executed and were not given a choice in where they now "rest". I'm not someone who believes in an afterlife and so I don't exactly worry for the person who is being displayed because he doesn't know, however if he had living family who wanted him properly buried that should have been the families choice, not Chinas. China should not be profiting off of these people, they should be donated.  In the original Body Worlds every body is donated by people who wanted to be apart of the exhibit. Now knowing this I regret spending my money here and wouldn't return. I would rather spend my money with a reputable organization.   Lastly, I think those who are pissed about these types of exhibits due to religious views because of unborn fetuses or people shouldn't see inside the human body in this manner really need to grow up. This is science related, keep your religious views to yourself. You don't see scientists and medical staff making a fuss over fictional religious stories being told in your church, do you?  No, because they respect the fact that you want to have a belief. So people who have an issue with this don't need to attend. So stop trying to ruin it for others!

I finally made it here! A co-worker has brought treats in from Essence Bakery, on several occasions.   My BF and I each had a macaron. One chocolate, and one vanilla bean. Both were excellent! The fillings were rich, sweet, and velvety. The cookie pieces of the macarons were perfectly chewy and dense. They were wonderful! A little pricey at $2.95 each, yes, but they were soooo delicious; its a nice special treat.   Service was very friendly and helpful. The shop itself was clean and organized. It has a  relaxing atmosphere, especially with the trees canopying the building. It would be wonderful to sit outside in cooler weather.  Definitely give this place a try!

Saturday night we finally got a chance to try Gelato 64. We have been meaning to come here for weeks but it never worked out. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly enough. We both ordered their smallest size which was plenty. He got some pistachio and volcano and I opted for the banana and tiramisu; both came with these cute little waffer cookies. We both loved our gelatos. They were really very good! A bit pricey for sure though. For the nearly $8.00 we spent we could have gone to the grocery store and purchased 3 half gallons of ice cream, and I know, I know I'm paying for the fact that its gelato but price is one reason why I'm not fond of "ice cream" type shops. It's just kind of ridiculous how much they charge. I was surprised that they only had roughly 30 flavors to choose from since the name indicates there would be over double that amount. One of the freezer cases was completely empty and the other two were only about half full. As we were eating our gelatos everyone was asked to leave because they were closing in a few minutes. I thought they still had another hour but I guess not. We'd definitely be back because it was really good, but not on a regular basis. Regardless of how delicious the gelatos are, to us, it's not worth spending so much money on such a small amount.

Now this is what I'm talking about! My boyfriend and I have been looking for a bar and grill type place to be regulars at and I think we finally found one. Due to the high ratings on Yelp we decided to head on over for a Friday night with food and music.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful. Also when we told her her this was our first time visiting she let the owner know, who came over and introduced herself! We thought that was very personable and pretty cool. It's nice that the owner likes to keep herself present which probably makes for a better running establishment.  We didn't want to get overly full so we decided to share a few appetizers. We ordered a dozen medium/honey wings, a basket of fried zucchini, and a basket of their fries. The wings were wonderful! Thinnly breaded and fried and then they even throw them back on the grill. They had that wonderful grilled flavor to them. The fried zucchini was a generous portion and they were so packed full of flavor. I'm picky about fried zucchini and these were awesome. Their fries are beer battered which are literally the best kind of fries your can possibly have. Everything came out piping hot and tasted delicious.  I had water with lemons (I had been drinking soda all day...yikes) but my boyfriend enjoyed his huge beer. Also we found out they have 40c wings on Tuesday's! We normally go to Native New Yorker but I think we're going to start coming here. I just wish they had more flavors to choose from. Maybe they'll start adding some!   The restaurant itself was clean and so comfortable. It's a pretty good sized place with an outdoor patio, an area with bartop tables and a third area, where we sat, with booths. The places is decorated with sports memorabilia and A LOT of tvs. I liked that they had a large variety of options playing so there was something for everyone; basketball, boxing, snowboarding, golf, hockey, etc...   At 9:30pm a band came in to play, Chuck E Baby was the name I believe. They were great! They kept the audience entertained between songs and took requests as well as played some of their original pieces. Ck's website has a band schedules which is Thursdays-Saturdays and there is never a cover charge.  We had a fantastic time and can't wait to go back!

We had to run over here to buy some French macarons before we left Vegas. The line was about 12 people deep, not too bad. The ladies who helped us were very nice. The macarons were delicious! Will absolutely hit this place up next time we're in Vegas. Wonderful, really wonderful!

I've been to both the Chandler location and the Tempe location many times. The food is always consistently good. Their wheat bread is the best; my boyfriend and I didn't care for the sourdough. I love their soups! They're flavorful and come piping hot. Their chicken salad sandwich is delicious, as is their gobbler sandwich and the Italian sandwich. Their establishments are always clean and the staff is always friendly. I do think they're a bit pricey which is why I can't give the 5 stars but I'll still keep coming back.

This place is okay. We've only been here once and while the environment was nice, the server we had was slow and didn't know the food very well. Also our food wasn't that good, plus it took forever to get it. I honestly had wished we would have gone to Outback Steakhouse instead, we've never had a problem with the Chandler location; great tasting food at good prices. While here at Firebirds my prime rib was bland and so was my boyfriend's steak. Nothing special even though you pay high prices. Ehh... I'd go else where.

We made it back here to give them another try. While the food wasn't terrible it wasn't amazing either. I stand by my original review. I had to add salt and pepper to my steak because it lacked flavor. Also this piece of prime rib was mostly fat. I cook steaks at home and know all about marbeling and how it gives flavor but there needs to be an even balance between the fat and meat otherwise you just feel ripped off. I still feel going to Outback Steakhouse will give you better tasting steaks with lower prices. The location on Chandler Blvd had never disappointed. Sorry Firebirds you're just not for us.

I really love Kirkland's. I have been shopping here for years. They have really wonderful home decor at affordable prices. I love coming here when they have big sales on holiday weekends. Plus if you sign up for emails you get coupons which you can use on top of any sales they have going on! The staff is always friendly and helpful, and the store is always clean and stocked full. This place is definitely one of my favorites.

I really love Crowded House. I bought a couch and cushioned chair from here a little over two years ago. We love it! Six months ago we purchased this cute light blue chair and love that as well. And now I'm looking for a new dining table so we're going to go there today! I can't get enough of all their decor and I love how the sales people never bother you. If you need something just find someone and they'll help you. I'll always go to crowded house (or potato barn) before going to other furniture stores who always have the save mass produced crap. At least here you get to find more unique pieces. Plus you can also order pieces in different colors or fabrics as well! Love this place!

Just really bad... We've been to this location twice now and it's just terrible. The wings are overly breaded and they kind of just slop the sauce on, not even covering the entire wing. Also we normally get the spicy honey mustard at other locations and I don't know what sauce this location uses but it isn't even a mustard. It's some sort of oily concoction that tastes like spicy fried oil. Yuck! Also the restaurant itself has an awkward setup that feels uncomfortable especially when the booths and tables are run down and old. My boyfriend happened to use their restroom and he said it was disgusting and compared it to a run down gas station bathroom. Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.  We normally go to the Ahwatukee location and I think we'll just keep making the 25 minute drive and go to a more comfortable location where the food is good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting.

Every time we go to this location the servers and staff are friendly, even the managers walk around asking how everything is. The food is always fantastic! We LOVE our prime rib and they always have delicious cuts, perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sides are wonderful too!! We'll continue to go here for our steak fix. MMMMMM!

Pretty good! We've gone here a few times. Pizza is always consistently good and they have the best ranch. The honey hot wings are not only huge but really tasty! Next time we go there we want to try their thin crust pizza. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I always feel they're a bit pricey. Last time we got a medium pizza and 12 wings and it was roughly $23, just seems a but much for that.

We ate here for the first time last week. We drive by it often enough and see the commercials so we decided to give it a try. I found a coupon on their website for a large half pepperoni, half Hawaiian pizza and since we liked both kinds we went for it. My boyfriend went to pick it up and he said he liked watching them put the ingredients on because they were fast and accurate. Everyone, he said, was friendly and they gladly accepted our coupon. Once the pizza was home we just followed the instructions and cooked it for about 16 minutes. It was wonderful!! The crust was soft but slightly crisp on the very bottom, the cheese was still "melty" since it had just come from our oven, and the ingredients tasted so fresh! Hands down this will be our "cheap" pizza of choice, the expensive pizza coming from Oregano's which we also love.

Okay...so...weird! I have been eating here for years and have never reviewed Costa Vida!! What is wrong with me!?!!   I have three words for you...sweet. pork. tacos. These have got to be my all time favorite tacos! I skip the rice and beans and opt for some chips and salsa instead. Perfect!  Fresh tortillas made right in front of you! Delicious salsas. Friendly service. Super fun atmosphere! Just go...go get some sweet pork tacos, kick back and enjoy a yummy meal every single time you visit.

You've got to try this place! After living in Chandler for a year and half we finally got around to trying Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria and we are so glad we did. First off the place is small but they do have a few tables inside and a handful outside. We were lucky because the sun was down and it was a breezy night, so we opted to stay but sit outside. We both ordered the serious slice; pepperoni. It's always good to test out a classic before getting into the complex pizzas. The pizza slices are pretty serious! One is the size of two large slices. They're similar in size I'd say to Venezia's but just slightly wider. They come on round metal pans and accompanied by a pizza cutter! At first I was thrown off by the pizza cutter and just wanted a regular knife but I soon got used to it and thought it was fun. The pizza itself was soooo- good! It was mostly thin crust New York style; I say mostly because the outer edge, where you'd normally hold a slice of pizza, was thicker. I wish it was as thin as the rest of the crust. Anyhow, it had thick melty cheese and oregano sprinkled on top. I always add more oregano and we both add the red pepper flakes. We both were in heaven with these slices. The serious slices are $5.50 and come with a drink, .50¢ extra for additional toppings. Jimmy & Joes does offer pick up, of course, and delivery. This place was so good we decided to go back two days later for lunch. I'm pretty sure Jimmy & Joe's will be our pizzeria of choice for quite a while.

My boyfriend I dined here a few months ago. We'd never been and thought we'd give it a try! The decor was lovely, the staff was very friendly, and the food looked spectacular! Now you'd think my star rating would be better but sadly it isn't. Even though everything looked amazing the food was actually tasteless. We were both surprised that our food tasted so terrible when it looks so amazing. I had ordered a shrimp plate and he ordered a lamb dish. Unfortunately we've never been back and probably wont ever go back.

We really like this bar! Not much to say; great drinks, yummy food, relaxing atmosphere! They always have good bands playing and fun events going on. Great place to kick back and catch up with some friends in a comfortable place.

We love this place! You can't go wrong if you eat here. Their chips and salsa are excellent and their burritos are so flavorful! I either always get their chorizo breakfast burrito or their chicken chimichanga. The BF usually gets something with carne asada or fish. Their friendly staff, clean establishment, and wonderful food keeps us coming back over and over!

Oh Burrito Company... no more...  I visited again and this time my experience was down right awful. I picked up a chorizo breakfast burrito to go. Super rude service and they charged me for extra salsas that weren't in the bag. I asked for the burrito to be double wrapped since I live in Maricopa and when I got home it wasn't, the burrito was cold. There was a hair wrapped into my burrito and to top it off I got really bad food poisoning and had to miss several days of work. Thanks burrito company...I won't be back.  I'll be taking my business to Los Taquitos, Rubios, Tortilla Fish, Chipotle or any other good Mexican food locations nearby that don't offer crappy service with a side of food poisoning.

I decided to give this place a try since the reviews are so high...plus I was craving a breakfast burrito. I'm about to give a lot of information that you may think will contradict my rating but please, just bear with me.   After finding the eatery, I parked and got our of my car. Oh boy, I was getting nervous. The place looked run down and dirty. There was debris in the parking lot; containers, pieces of trash and such. Behind the restaurant was another unidentified building. Maybe it's the owners home..? The outside of the eatery didn't look appealing at all but I thought, "Nope, Yelp says it's great. I can usually rely on my fellow Yelpers." Take a deep breath! As I walked inside, I purposely didn't look around. Instead I immediately looked at the menu chose my dish, ordered, and paid. I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito with potato and cheese.  I ended up waiting about 10 minutes since there were a few orders ahead of mine. This, unfortunately, gave me time to look around. Old food stuck onto floors that looked like they hadn't been mopped in ages. There was some other dark smudges that I couldn't make out what it was...or had been. Large areas of paint peeling off the walls, bits of paper from straw sleeves laying around, clumps of dust and cob webs hanging around the air vents and upper corners of the building. There was a wooden bench that looks like a couple slates were missing from its seat. The place really needed to be thoroughly scrubbed.  While waiting I helped myself to two different kinds of salsa from the salsa bar. Finally my food was ready. I was surprised at how heavy the bag felt. I drove back to work and opened the yellow paper that contained my burrito. My god the thing was huge! It was like a small baby! Alright, so, the test! I took my fork and knife cut off a bite, put a little of the fresh red salsa on it and ate it. Wow, It was EXACTLY what I have been looking for in a breakfast burrito!!! The chorizo was spicy, the potatoes seasoned, the egg not dried out, the cheese gooey and melty, and the tortilla was the perfect texture. It had that, almost, transparent look to it, you know, the kind where you know it was handmade. Then I tried it with the green salsa verde! Omg!! So flavorful and delicious! I was in breakfast burrito heaven! However, the thing was so big that I could only eat half.  So! Now you understand my high rating despite my earlier comments.  This is a true "hole in the wall". Do I want to know what their kitchen looks like, HELL NO! But I will continue to go back because the food is THAT good. I'm so glad my Yelpers didn't let me down. ;)

I guess we came here on a good night compared to some other reviewers.   After seeing the crazy wait for the buffet on thanksgiving night we ended up here. We were sat right next to the fountain which was so relaxing. Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu items.  I had a seafood Alfredo type dish with lobster, shrimp and scallops,  and my boyfriend had the chicken parmesan. Both of our meals were excellent. I do think it was a bit pricey but the food and service was very good.  The only thing that was little annoying was having people taking pictures right in front of our table since we were sitting right next to the fountain but we tried to just ignore it and enjoy a relaxing evening.

We've gone here quite a few times and every time its great! My boyfriend loves the beer and we always get burgers because they're just that good. Prices are moderate; roughly $11.00 per person for food, throw in a few more dollars for a beer. It can be pretty loud on a weekend night but hey, its not only a bar, its brewery! Atmosphere is fun and service is always friendly.

We have been here twice and both times were very good! My boyfriend likes his steak  sandwich with the onions, peppers, and cheese wiz, I get mine with provolone, mushrooms and onions, and we usually share some French fries. These sandwiches are HUGE!! I can't imagine ordering the large when I can barely finish the regular and I think next time I go I'll order the kid sized! Also if you order a sandwich and fries you'll get a free drink. I like the bread and I love that they have malt vinegar available! They also have sweet potato fries which are soooo- yummy! I will say its a bit pricey but it is really good... The atmosphere is clean, friendly, and very enjoyable. Whenever we have a craving for cheesesteak sandwiches this is where we go! Forefathers for the win!

Gotta say I'm not as impressed with forefathers anymore. The sandwiches seem smaller and not as flavour as they used to be. For two sandwiches and one drink it cost over $20!!! That's really overpriced. Insanely overpriced!  Additionally during their busiest time they allow patrons who are no longer eating to just hang out while a line starts to form for those waiting for a table to open. We didn't have time to wait so we were forced outside in the 110° heat. No misters, no outdoor fans. We were sweating horribly and both of us just scarfed down our food just so we could get back into our air conditioned car. We didn't enjoy it at all. Either get a larger establishment or ask people to not hog tables when they're clearly done and its the busiest part of the day. Awful experience.

This place is ok. It's not great, really, I could name a handful of other great places to go before coming here. The service was decent, the food was mediocre at best and the prices were a bit high for what you got. $8 for one pancake? I thought it was a mistake or that it came with eggs, bacon and hash browns. Nope just the pancake. I wouldn't come back here.

Oh this place was great!! The wait is awful, so just know that. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner you will be waiting for quite a while if you show up at peak times. But once we got seated everything was great from there. The service was friendly and fast and the food was really good! It's one of those places where you want to keep eating after you're full. I would definitely want to come back here and try other dishes.

Bad...just really bad!  Was excited to see something different other then "burgers and fries". I thought, "Oooh, Hawaiian food, great! Something different!" I was so wrong. First off the place was filthy and I had to wipe down my own table. Staff was rude and obviously hated their jobs. And the worst part ever and why I will not be going back, they do not properly clean the shrimp. That to me is unforgivable. I couldn't even eat the rest of my dish once I saw that. If they don't clean the shrimp and devein it properly, what else do they not clean?!! Never ever again!

A couple nights ago we visited Spices and really enjoyed it! We both ordered the gyro plates which actually has A LOT of food, so next time we'll just get the sandwiches. The meat was seasoned well, and the pita was soft and fluffy. And I loved the tzatziki sauce! The yellow rice was flavorful and moist and I absolutely loved the Mediterranean salad! The staff was very helpful and extremely friendly. Next time we both want to try the falafel! Definitely give this place a try, I know we'll absolutely be back!

I've been to Jamba Juice and I never like it. I'm not sure what they put in their smoothies because it always tastes bitter, grainy, and tastes like diet food. But at Tropical Smoothie it's always a flavor explosion of goodness in my mouth. I did learn a long time ago that I've never cared for TS' s food, so this review is solely based on their smoothies...although maybe they've made some changes in the last 15 years and I should try it...  Anyhow! Going to Tropical Smoothie, for me, is a rare treat and not something I do on a regular basis, 1) because I'm almost never near one, and 2) like coffee, it can get pricey.  So with that in mind, I couldn't care less how annoying the staff is. As long as my smoothie is mouthgasmic those rowdy, bored looking teens can do whatever they want. My favorites are the Peanut Butter Cup, Bahama Mama, Sunrise Sunset, Paradise Point, Beach Bum, TropiColada, and Pineapple Delight. Yum yum! I hope to never see Tropical Smoothie go out of business because their smoothies truly are the best ones I've ever had!

I have come here twice; once with my dad on father's day and this morning with my boyfriend. Both times everything was really delicious. Both times I've gotten the Shirley's Gone Bananas. A crepe with nutella, strawberries, bananas and whipped topping. MmmmmMm! If you go on Saturday or Sunday morning be prepared to wait because it gets pretty busy and it's a small cafe. The staff are friendly and the place is clean. The only thing I wish they had are side orders of eggs, bacon or sausage and potatoes for the breakfast crepes and chips or fries for the lunch crepes.  The crepes are an ok size but if you're wanting a big hearty meal this isn't it. At least they don't over charge, their prices match what you get, so that's good! If we're ever in the mood for crepes this is where we'll go!

Awful, just awful! All the food was bland and tasteless. The steaks were dry and mealy, the waitress constantly kept saying, "i don't know" to everything we asked and she would only tell us the larger sized beers because she kept trying to up sell. Also they were out of medium rare prime rib, the mushrooms obviously came from a can, the potatoes were also dry and bland, and the au jus was some weird thick dark sauce. Don't go here, just go to Outback, its slightly cheaper and MUCH better quality.

We just got done having an early dinner here and it was excellent! My boyfriend had the beef Pho and I had the chicken Mi Ga. Absolutely flavorful and just all out delicious! The staff was friendly and was courteous as well as accommodating when we let them know of my boyfriend's shellfish allergy. They actually helped him pick a safer broth. The portions are huge so we'll have plenty for lunch tomorrow too. I can't wait to come back here! This place truly is unPhogettable!

Today we decided to give Moreno's a try and had our first Sonoran hot dogs! In case you're like us and have never had one, it's a hot dog wrapped in bacon which was topped with chopped tomato, onions, pinto beans, salsa, chilies, ketchup, mustard, and mayo all nestled into a light as air, fluffy bun. We both really enjoyed them! Also I'm really big on having house made chips and salsa so we got a side of that so I could give it a try. The salsa was great! Nice texture, flavor and spiciness. However the chips were...eh. I wish they made them from scratch or at least bought better quality, more authentic chips. These reminded me of something you would find at any grocery store. The place was clean and festive inside, and the staff were friendly enough. We'll go back so we can try some of their other items.

What can I say?! Crackers is by far our favorite place for breakfast. We have been here a couple dozen times and we've never left disappointed. Wonderful service, fantastic food, and a comfortable and cozy atmosphere. The skillets are flavorful, the egg benedicts are perfectly cooked, and if you're craving something sweet try one of their french toast breakfasts. It doesn't get any better than this! I wish I could give it 10 stars!!

We're so done with this place.  Years ago Gordon's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on Mill Ave, or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun. Now Gordon's is a place full of constant disappointments. A couple months ago we went to the Gordon's in San Tan Village and we were served cold, tasteless food. A month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again. This time I wrote to Gordon's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits, and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another try.  Today we visited the Mill Ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards I wished we hadn't gone. We sat in the self seating area near the bar. Our server was very standoffish and you could tell he didn't want to be there at all. He brought us our soda's and took our order but he didn't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides. While waiting for our food I noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them!! I grabbed another server who was walking by and told her. She apologized and took the glasses. A few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said, "Well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it's okay." Are you effing kidding me!? Finally the food came and just like the San Tan Village location the food was cold, and absolutely tasteless. We finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left.   Seriously, if you're looking for a fabulous burger, great beer, excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please try San Tan Brewery which is in Chandler off of Arizona Ave and Chandler Blvd in the old town area. You won't be disappointed! As my dad would say, they could sell their burgers in India they're so good. http://www.santanbrewing.com Or if you're near Tempe and okay with fighting for parking try Four Peak's Brewery, they're also fantastic.  http://www.fourpeaks.com/

We ate here a few weeks ago but took it home instead of eating there since its self serve seating and there were no available tables. My hubby got the Cottage's Pie and I had the Oggie. We both liked our food but I think my hubby liked his more then I liked mine. I think the flavors were over powering and too bold. It just seemed off and extremely heavy. Next time we go I'll try the Reuben pasty with corned beef and pastrami, it should be a bit lighter and more to my liking. Service was good, everyone was nice, and I loved the décor of the restaurant. Very old world British looking with the  dark woods mixed with white walls.

We finally made it back here to give them another try.  Service was...eh...but they were seriously packed, so it's understandable. We took our two rueben pasties to go and damn did they hit the spot! They were fantastic! We'll definitely keep going back! Also, I'm not sure how long ago this happened but they expanded. The restaurant is twice the size now. Which is great because now we can try eating there instead of bringing it home.

No no no! Our first day/night our a/c wasn't working and so it was hot. Then every night we stayed there including the first, when we pulled back, what was supposed to be, clean bed sheets we found hair! And not any hair, pubic hair! Omg...*gag*...there were like 4 or 5 of them! Also the sheets had these yellowish stains from overuse. It was disgusting. And to make matters worse my boyfriend kept breaking out in hives in the morning! When we finally checked out I talked to the guy behind the counter who said all he could do was return the resort's fees. I may end up contacting Hotwire and see about getting a refund. Ugh. Never again with this place!

Well, we finally went in and tried the food this time. (We had gone in a few weeks back and didn't eat because there were no available tables and it just felt uncomfortable in such a small space.) I'm sorry I don't understand the hype because the food was mediocre at best. Boiled hot dogs with toppings; something we could easily make at home. They would be better prepared on a BBQ or grill. Again the environment was just over crowded; no available tables, and being that there are only roughly 6 tables, this is easily accomplished. I will say their prices are very fair and staff is very friendly its just something we decided isn't worth the money and probably wouldn't return.

I struggled between 3 and 4 stars but I'll go with 4 since we were pretty impressed. Its not 5 because this is a small buffet and I felt like there wasn't much to choose from BUT from what we did have the quality was very good! We decided to go on crab night because I love crab. Too bad my boyfriend is allergic to shellfish. Poor guy...   So! The crab was perfect. It's a nice sweet snow crab that easily broke from it's shell in nice large chunks of meat. Mmmmm.... The clusters are a good size and they're steamed and kept hot, so nothing soggy or soaked in water. What I loved is that everyone can't go in and horde all the best pieces like at Harrah's in Maricopa. Instead you wait your turn and you're handed a plate full of clusters by the chefs. Also the butter available is a delicious clarified butter.  We also tried the roast beef, roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, green salad, rolls, fried rice, orange chicken, and a couple pasta salads. Not one thing was bad. Everything was of high quality and was seasoned well. Nothing tasted from cans or boxes and we're very picky about this because we don't cook from any boxes or cans. The desserts were fantastic! Small samples of an assortment of chocolate mousses, creme brulees, jellos, ice creams, cakes, and cookies. Nothing tasted frozen, everything was fresh, flavorful and tasted made that day. We were very impressed on how much detail they put into the desserts since this is where places can really lack.   Additionally, it was only $18 per person where at Harrah's it's $25! Plus we signed up for the rewards cards so we could get the $8 bucks off our total from the free points they give you when you sign up. We were extremely impressed and other than the buffet itself being small, it reminded us of a good Vegas buffet. We'll definitely be making the 45 minute drive one way instead of going to Harrah's down the street.  (Sorry for the dark crab picture, my phone was dying so the flash wouldn't go off)

After moving to Maricopa a month ago we finally decided to try the sunrise cafe for lunch. The atmosphere was ok and the staff was friendly enough. I had the ruben sandwich and my husband had the bacon and swiss burger. The wait for our food was a bit long, longer then you'd expect for two sandwiches and some fries. The fries were cold, over cooked, and had zero seasoning. My ruben really should have had double the amount of corn beef on it. I was very surprised at how little they put on. Also, no coarse mustard!!?!? How can you serve corned beef and not have coarse mustard to offer guests? My husband's burger was cooked to the temperature he liked, however, he said it was very bland. Again, no seasoning on anything. Also some of the staff tend to like to have personal, non work related conversations right in front of guests. It was inappropriate. As we were finishing up I was watching a server refill the sugars and ketchup bottles. They keep all of their packets of sugars in these old filthy buckets and then place them on your table top but don't wipe the tables off afterwards. Refilling ketchup bottles didn't seem any cleaner as they were pouring it from an old, dingy, plastic, pitcher. Those two things kind of grossed me out. Granted I'm a bit of a clean freak but still if you're going to do these things in front of customers at least make it look more presentable. Also wish the staff were a bit more respectful I'm not your hun nor your sweetie and don't really care for people who call people that. Anyhow, we might be back to try breakfast but if that goes the way our lunch did, we wouldn't come back.

We finally came here for breakfast and it was okay but nothing special. My boyfriend's waffle was definitely frozen and reheated as it was mushy instead of crispy. He said his food was bland and even the coffee seemed cheap. My eggs Benedict was decent enough but I've had way better. We just don't understand why so many people like to rave about this place, maybe it's because this is basically the only breakfast place Maricopa has. We're looking forward to moving back to Chandler next year so we can go back to our favorite places.

Okay Harrah's you and I need to have a talk. Tonight we decided to try the Eagles Buffet at Casino Arizona in Scottsdale and that buffet made us realize you've been ripping us off. Long story short. They have WAY better food; higher quality, including the crab. The food was seasoned well and nothing tasted frozen and reheated. Their desserts were fantastic and yours are absolutely terrible. There is sooo much more you could be doing. Like at Eagles they don't make people wait in crazy lines according to reward levels where you show up and watch others get seated immediately while you've been waiting an hour. Inexcusable. Oh! And the best part, they're $7 cheaper per person. So! We've decided to lower your star rating until you get your act together. Even with the gas mileage driving a 70 mile round trip we still save $6 and get way better food and service from Eagles than at your buffet. Shame. For the readers, make the drive to Scottsdale, it's so worth your time, much more than paying inflated prices at Harrah's for what we now realize is crap.

My work was offering discounts for this restaurant and since I had been here roughly 5 years ago, and loved it, I thought it would be fun to take my boyfriend here for dinner. So I purchased one of the gift certificates being offered and we visited the Mesa location last night. Unfortunately, it seems the food and quality has really plummeted since my last visit.   Service was subpar. While our server did get us everything we needed in a timely manner she wasn't friendly at all. She seemed bored and almost put off by having to even be there.   The food was...eh. I'm pretty sure our second bowl of chips were left over's from another table. When we first arrived we were given a bowl of very warm chips. As we ran out I watched a manager clear off a table from customers who has just left but they had a full bowl of chips on the table. I watched the manager walk back to the kitchen and within a minute or so our server walked out with a bowl of chips. When I grabbed one it was cold. This tells me the chips on our table didn't come from the same place as the first bowl of warm chips. We didn't touch anymore chips. I'm 100% sure that the shrimp I was given was frozen, and then possibly microwaved. It definitely wasn't freshly cooked shrimp as it was bland, and rubbery. The refried beans are unquestionably canned instead of made fresh. They had that same dry texture and metal taste as the canned variety. My boyfriends carne asada burrito was just that; cooked beef wrapped in a tortilla. No salsa, no sour cream or beans, no onions, no peppers or tomatoes. Nothing was in this tortilla except for cooked beef. I've never seen a burrito that didn't have any other elements to it other than meat. It was strange. We tried the fried ice cream for dessert and they didn't even bother to crush the corn flakes, they just stuck them onto the ice cream whole before slightly frying. Since the cornflakes didn't fry all the way this gave it a terrible, thick, and yet almost stale type of texture. It looked very appealing but it truly was a disappointment compared to other fried ice creams I've had.   Had it not been for the $25 off we would have definitely complained to the manager. We won't be going back nor will we purchase anymore coupons from my work for this restaurant. Quality and service is just too low compared to the prices they have listed. There are better Mexican restaurants around to choose from.

Tried this place again and the fish didn't seem fresh at all. Something tasted off and we couldn't eat it all for fear of getting sick. They still don't know how to roll them correctly either. Completely oversized and falling apart is what you get. Also it took forever to get our order and it's just overpriced. I'd rather spend the gas money and go to a good sushi place in Chandler or Ahwatukee then come here. This place is NOT a 4 star sushi place, how it got those kind of reviews I have no clue since it keeps getting worse.

We liked it! Friendly staff, extremely clean facility, nice prices and great quality of ingredients. On weekends they have a special; 2 regular subs, 2 chips, and 2 drinks for $12.99. They have a handful of toppings to choose from...I really wished they had black olives but they do have pickles! Also if you get it "Mikes Way", which is vinegar, oil, and spices, you should know they really pour on the vinegar. I prefer alot of vinegar so I like it but those of you who dont may need to let them know to go light on the vinegar. So if you're looking for some yummy subs give them a try!

This review is mainly for their Ovation Live! Showroom. We came here last night to see Jim Jefferies live and we were so excited, he's one of our favorite stand up comics. When we got into the theater we realized the seats aren't stadium seating, there isn't even a slight slope so that the people in front of you are slightly lower, nothing. And of course the people in front of us were seriously 6ft4 so my 5ft1 ass couldn't see anything. I was so disappointed. I got glimpses here and there but I came to see Jim live, not watch on a poorly lit projection screen above him. Why wouldn't they create this theater like others I've been to with stadium seating or at least have a nice slope so the people in front aren't completely blocking your view? So we spent roughly $140 bucks and barely saw anything. Plus what was more is the seats up in the balcony were stadium seating. So they paid cheaper prices and actually got to see. Very frustrating. Oh and the actual seats were shit, they were old and cheap. So overall it was disappointing.  As far as the rest of the casino, I didn't notice too much of a smoke issue unless I was right next to someone smoking. The place was decorated nicely and actually kind of reminded us of a mini Vegas casino a little. However don't expect to get a signal on your phone. We couldn't use our phones the entire time we were there and unless you're sleeping in the hotel you can't get their wifi access. Oh, and don't go to the 24/7 Cafe, it's absolutely terrible, I posted a review on them.   Overall it was a so-so, ok kind of place. I would go back here but only for an awesome show that I don't want to miss otherwise I doubt we'd be back in for any other reason.

Very excited about this Asian market! There was so much to see and buy! Everything looked fresh, clean and the staff seemed friendly. Will definitely be back!

Last night my boyfriend said he wanted a big juicy burger for dinner so we decided to try Lobbys. He definitely got his burger fix! The burgers were packed with toppings, the beef was flavored, and the cheese completely melted (I hate when cheese isn't melted). Their crinkle cut fries were crispy, salted and so yummy. Mmmm... everything was delicious! They also offered us fry sauce. It tastes very similar to Freddys or Kanes dipping sauce. The place was clean and the staff very friendly. We'd definitely be back!

There isn't much to say. Excellent fresh burgers and fries! This is one of the better fast food places, plus its dirt cheap. Oh and if you've never tried your burger "animal style" please do, it's part of their secret menu.

Despite my lack of check-ins, I've been to this location at least a dozen times in the last couple years and i really like them. I've never had a problem at this location. Let me say that again, this location! I have had food poisoning from the location on baseline and mcclintock. Anyhow, this location is always really clean and the staff are very friendly. I've never had an issue with bones like others have stated and the food is always fresh. I like the ultimate chicken bowl and the avocado burrito is really good too. The avocado salsa is good too!  Plus they have cherry coke! Win!

We came here looking and worked with Jeff who was very nice and really helpful. I only found one dining set that I sort of liked but I'm not sold on the quality of the chairs, I liked the table though. So we're going to keep looking. But since Jeff was so nice and genuinely seemed to care and want to help us I wanted to give review for others that might want to purchase here. Everyone was very nice, no one was pushy, and I would recommend this store purely based on the friendly staff.

We came here for dinner in hopes that this place would end up being a bar we could go to on a regular basis. We generally have to drive out to Chandler or Ahwatukee to get anything decent; Maricopa isn't exactly booming with great places to eat or shop. When we walked in I liked the atmosphere of the bar; all the things hanging on the walls and from the ceiling was fun. It was pretty busy and it took a few minutes for someone to find us a table. Once sat our server introduced herself and took our drink order. She came back and we ordered some chips and salsa to start. We got our appetizer. The chips and pico de gillo was great but the other salsa tasted off...it had a metallic taste. We were waiting for our server to come back to take our entree order but she was running around to other tables. We waited, and waited...and waited. 25 minutes later another server saw our menus still on the table when she went to grab them l I told her we'd been waiting quite a while to order. She took our order; I asked for the fish and chips and my boyfriend ordered the meatball sub. Now we waited and waited...and waited again. The woman who took our entree order brought us more chips and salsa on the house for the delay. Finally after another 25 minutes we got our food. We were trying to stay positive thinking maybe all this waiting will be worth it. It really wasn't. My fish and chips seriously looked like those fish sticks you got as a kid. They looked very unappetizing and the portion did not match the price. Also the breading on them was falling off and was moist instead of crispy. I couldn't believe I was paying near $13 for 5 little fish sticks and some under seasoned, frozen, crinkle cut fries. This meal should really be priced around $8...$9 at the most. My boyfriend's meatball sub was also on the smaller side as well but he did say it was tasty, however they really jipped him on fries. Our original server came back, apologized, and refilled our drinks. The whole evening was kind of blah. I could honestly overlook all the waiting but what I can't overlook are the prices you pay for the food you get. It's truly not worth it. I'd rather make the drive out to Chandler or Ahwatukee and get better food and better service. We're not sure if we'd be back. Who pays $33 for cheap fish sticks and fries and a small meatball sub!? We could have gone to Outback Steakhouse and gotten delicious prime rib for that price.

For whatever reason I didn't check the yelp reviews prior to coming here. I have been going to another nail salon by the ace hardware store and while they're ok for the most part I wanted to try a new place. I was surprised how large this nail salon was and it was decorated very nicely. It looks like they put a lot of money into it. I asked for a pedicure and they had me pick out a color and got me sat immediately. When I sat in the spa pedi seat the water was a bit cold but I didn't worry about it. The man working with me asked if I had ever been in and I told him no and he seemed insulted. He then asked if I lived in town and I said yes. Again, his face showed insult. He asked if I had just moved here and I was nervous about annoying him and almost lied but I said that I had been here almost 3 years. He looked very annoyed by this. I just shrugged it off. Aside from that uncomfortable situation the rest of my visit went well. He gave the absolute best foot and leg massage from any nail salon I have ever been to. This was not a typical 2 minute massage that most nail salons give. He sets a timer of 10 minutes per foot, then he used hot stones and hot towels. Being a massage therapist myself I could tell he either has had training in massage or he's been doing it long enough that he knows the muscles well. I was in heaven. Once he started painting my toes I found it odd that he waited in between coats. Everywhere else they always do the layers of paint right after the other but he waited about 5-10 minutes between each coat of paint. So I let my tootsies dry and went to the front desk to pay. Unfortunately, they don't have a tip area on their credit card slips. Okay, if you're not going to allow me to leave a tip on my receipt then you're not getting one. I'm not trying to be rude I just don't ever carry cash, not ever. I know they don't want to pay taxes on their tips but isn't some tip on a card better than nothing? So I felt bad but left without tipping. A few days later I noticed a lot of the paint was chipping off. I don't know if this is from him waiting so long between coats or what but I wasn't too happy. I don't know if I'd go back... Overall I think this place is ok, and the massage was amazing but it's possible he gave me a better massage then normal knowing I was a new customer and he wanted me to come back. And I really don't like having to make an extra stop at the bank to get cash if I were to come here, it's too much of a hassle when I just want to stop by after work. So I'm not sure. I think for now I'll go back to the regular place by ace hardware.

My mom and I came here to get pedicures. Not much to say. Pretty typical nail salon. It was relaxing and they did a good job. However when we were ready to pay my mom gave the nail tech her credit card. The nail tech actually had the audacity to ask us to give her the tip in cash. My mom said she didn't have cash and she would be paying with a card. The lady said she understood she wanted to pay with her card but could she please pay her tip with cash. My mom was getting pretty confused and uncomfortable. So I told her that we would be paying with a card and to please go charge it. Seriously!!?? I had to explain to my mom that she wanted cash so she wouldn't have to pay taxes on her tips. Ridiculous!!! It was extremely unprofessional and rude. For this reason I won't be going back.

I've gone here a few times for pedicures since moving to Maricopa and so far so good on experiences. Their prices are reasonable and everyone is friendly. They always do a great job. Plus their cheapest pedicure includes hot stones. Oooooh I could really use one right now as I sit at my desk at work, with my brain barely functional from staring at mortgage loans all day.... Anyhow! Yes give them a try! I came here when we first moved to Maricopa and haven't tried any other places because this place is great, I have no reason to switch.

We love RigaTony's! It's always clean and the staff is always very friendly. The inevitable 30 minute wait on a Friday or Saturday night is worth it. Their fried zucchini is wonderful and we always get the RigaTony pasta, its delicious! Also their Apple Bread Pudding is OUT OF THIS WORLD and if they ever remove if from the menu again my boyfriend vows to picket them. lol That is actually one of the reason's I'm giving them a 5 star. The fact that they listened to their customers who were begging for the Apple Bread Pudding to be put back on the menu shows they actually do care. As long as they keep the apple bread pudding (that my boyfriend would lose a limb for) we'll keep coming back!

For a buffet in Arizona this is the closest you'll get to a Las Vegas quality buffet. This is hands down the best buffet in Arizona with its sister casino's buffet The Eagles being #2 if you want a cheaper option. Everything was fresh, seasoned well and delicious. There were a lot of choices and the cooks were constantly putting out fresh items.  The crab legs...oh the yummy crab legs.  Individual legs, split in half for you, bursting with delicious sweet crab meat.  Lobster claws, scallops, muscles, oysters and shrimp also adorn the table. And don't worry they have drawn butter for dipping. Fyi, if you go on a night where the crab is on ice just ask one of the friendly cooks to throw them into the pot of boiling water to get them heated.  We liked this place so much we came here Friday night and then Saturday night we were like, "why not!". Lol The first time we came to The Wandering Horse we were sat towards the back near a windowless area, but on Saturday I asked for a table right near the big windows so we had a beautiful view of the mountains.   Tip! This place starts getting a decent line a half hour before they open. So if you don't want to wait and wait I suggest getting here early. We got there on Saturday around 3:45 and were second in line. By the time they opened the line was about 30 people deep and growing. By the time we left around 7pm (we like to enjoy and take our time)the line was easily 60 people deep.   Definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.

Came here for the first time the other day while on my lunch from work. I ordered the #8 Sparky which was really tasty and was a great size. It was much bigger then I had expected. I wish they offered kettle chips or a better variety then Lays potato chips. Also, I wish they had some homemade potato salad like a red potato salad with dill. Something more exciting than the plain, old, boring, yellow potato salad that most places carry. So instead of getting a combo I bought just the sandwich, and went across the street to QT to buy a drink and chips, which is fine.  Okay I do have one pet peeve about this place.  I think it's absolutely crazy that they don't answer the phone during the lunch rush. To me, that is really poor service. Don't get me wrong, obviously by my rating I truly like this place, but to say you're not going to answer the phone because of the rush seems almost...lazy. There are PLENTY of places that have lunch rushes, and some bigger than here and they answer the phones. I almost didn't come here because I originally was told about this place from a coworker so I Googled their number and called to find out more specifically where they were located. But instead of speaking with someone I listened to a message that stated no one would answer the phone during this time. It's a good thing I found them because had I not, that alone would make me not want to try them. It's a pretty big inconvenience to customers who have never been or would like to know about the items they carry. I just don't feel a business should ignore their customers just because they're busy.  Even with the above I will still come here because the sandwiches are excellent!!! And this is coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of subs or sandwiches; I think it's because I ate them so much as a kid.

Dang it! Why didn't I check Yelp before coming here!?I hate when I do that.  Don't go here, you'll hate it. It took thirty minutes to get our food which wasn't even worth the wait.  It was very bland and greasy. Plus we weren't the only ones. There was a manager at one table dealing with food issues, another table where the guy told a server that if his sever doesn't get them the bill they're walking out, another table that had stopped eating and started looking around anxiously and then there was us, 25 minutes and counting to receive a burger and a sandwich. Nope wouldn't go back. Bland, greasy, overpriced food with seriously ridiculous wait times.

I vistied this office for years because this is where JoEllen Embry practiced and she has been my go-to WHNP for 10 or 12 years now. So this review is NOT a reflection on JoEllen but of this office and how they run their business. They're so busy with patients but they refuse to extend their hours and on Fridays they even close at noon! Then you get there on time but you're not taken back to a room for at least a half hour over your appointment then you sit in the room for another half hour before your doc comes in. However, if you're running late they won't work with you. Plus, I would literally have to schedule an appointment with JoEllen 8 months ahead of time. That is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. JoEllen also had no time to discuss much while I was there because she was so swamped. I've known her for many years and while she was here she always seemed overworked and stressed. Other office quirks I didn't care for were the long hold times when I called in or being made to feel like I was a bother to the front desk ladies. I also kept dealing with billing issues with this office with how they coded things for my insurance. I have not had issues since following JoEllen to her new practice in Mesa. Lastly when JoEllen left their practice no one from their office bothered to inform me. Knowing that I have ONLY seen JoEllen they should be well aware of my opinion on who sees me and they allowed me to keep my appointment and not tell me someone else would be seeing me. That is unprofessional. I just so happened to call to confirm my appointment with her the day before and they said it wouldn't be with JoEllen. I immediately cancelled my appointment. Dealing with woman issues is stressful enough on its own, I don't need excess stress added to it.

We've only been here once and it was for take out. When we got home everything was still nice and hot and tasted fresh. The staff was friendly and there was a fun band playing while we waited for our to-go order. We'd definitely make our way back here again.

REALLY awful. We were sat across from the bar somewhat near the front entrance. Our server came and we both ordered drinks, he ordered a beer and I had a Malibu and pineapple. Once our drinks were delivered mine had a bug in it as well as a clear shard of plastic. Really..? You didn't notice that when you were making the drink? I let the bartender know and he got me a new drink which also had a bug in it. I sent it back and declined another drink. After receiving our food something caught my eye right above and slightly behind my boyfriends head. A swarm of gnats was actually circling near the wall that separated us from the servers walkway. I couldn't stop staring at them. I told my boyfriend but I guess from his angle and the light he really couldn't see the tiny bugs flying near his head.  The prices really don't match the food y ou get. They really should lower their prices. The salad is pathetic with its place iceberg lettuce and basically no dressing.  The pastas we ordered were bland and tasteless. The only decent thing was the spumoni you get at the end of your meal.  I was so uncomfortable here I don't want to ever go back. Every time my boyfriend asks if we should try them again all I can think of are those bugs and I veto the option immediately. We love RigaTony's and Oregano's; WAY better food, great service, and an inviting atmospheres. Please trust me and MANY of reviewers, just don't waste your time or money coming here.

We decided to give Gold Chef a try based on yelp reviews.  The egg rolls were...eh...they didn't have any pork or chicken in them and they're quite oily on the inside.The crab ragoons were perfect!! We shared the orange chicken and sweet and sour pork with fried rice. The two entrees were delicious! Although the fried rice was plain; no veggies or egg, I didn't realize they had more than one kind and they charge you $2 extra for it. All in all it was a positive experience and we would definitely come back but next time we'll just have the ragoons and share an entree since it was too much food.

I've got to give this place a 5 star! We drove from Maricopa to go furniture shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus. We had an excellent experience and will absolutely be going back!

AHHH-MAZING!!! I don't want to make this a lengthy review so here's just a few things.  The atmosphere was wonderful. It was trendy with it's wooden accents, lit candles, and stark white linens.  The service was outstanding. Couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable and sincere guy. Even when someone in our party ordered something that is normally sent back he let her know, and then gave her another option that would go with the tastes she was looking for. He was wonderful at pairing the perfect wines with our food.  The food was out of this world. We shared the Chopped Salad (which has it's own Facebook page, lol). It was hands down the best salad I've ever eaten, and I'm not a salad person. We both ordered the filet mignon which came with some greens and smashed potatoes. I've have never had a more tender and juicy filet in my life. It was absolutely fantastic! Hats off to the chef!  Please know this place is quite pricey so be prepared for that. Our salad, two filets, and his two beers came to about $93 but it was so amazingly worth the splurge.

Another let down in Maricopa. The yogurt we had was bitter and gritty. We didn't like it at all. The majority of it went in the trash. So sad because we really wanted to be able to come here for our frozen yogurt fix. The place was decorated nicely and kept very clean. That's the only reason I'm giving it two stars but I know we won't be back.

I tried this place for lunch during work one day. I really liked it! They have a good size menu and the staff is super friendly. They explained a lot of different things about how they get special ingredients shipped from overseas and how duck sauce is not traditional so they don't have it, lol. I did feel the portions were a bit small compared to other places I've been, paying similar prices but it was very tasty and I'd go back to try more for sure.

I went Savante yesterday for cut and color. I told the stylist, Tanya, I wanted to be a light, very ash blonde with darker low lights throughout. I showed her several examples. As far as cut, I wanted to get rid of the dead ends but still wanted long hair, with layers. Prior to my visit my hair was quite long, to my lower back and had lots of layers. What I got was hair that is a yellow/orange/peach color and to my shoulders. I've been dying and bleaching my own hair for years and the last 4 months I have taken myself from very dark brunette/red to blonde. I felt my hair was light enough now that a great colorist could get the color right where I wanted it. Even though the color isn't what I wanted, it's the cut that I'm most upset about...ugh.  When we discussed length I told her I still wanted long hair. I told her I wanted it at the bottom of my shoulder blades and for the front to still be able to easily get into a low ponytail. It's now a couple inches above my shoulder blades. I was not expecting it that short! When I first saw how short it was I was shocked but I told myself it was okay it wasn't that bad, it'll grow out. To me, having hair just a couple inches below the shoulders isn't long. What's worse is even though she put layers in it, it's basically all one length. I'm used to being able to pull the back of my hair forward and it being longer than the front, I can't do that at all. I really hate this cut and the more I looked at it after I left the more I realized how much was gone. So much that when I picked up my boyfriend and he looked at it I actually cried!! I never thought I'd be one of those girls that cries over hair, I thought those girls were being too dramatic. And here I was, getting very emotional about all my hair being gone. I kept touching it and then getting upset all over again. I think it's such a shock because I've never had this happen to me before. What was even more upsetting is I didn't even have a nice experience while I was there. Normally when I go to a salon I feel pampered, chit chat with the stylist and just relax. Yesterday I felt like either she was in a bad mood, or maybe she didn't like that I scheduled the same day...something felt off. I felt very awkward. I tried making small talk but it didn't last. After about 10 minutes I stopped trying and just sat quietly listening to the other clients and stylists conversations. I also got the feeling she really didn't like the fact that I dyed or bleached my own hair. Other stylists I've worked with just laugh it off and don't make me feel like I've done something wrong. She was very short about it all. Idk, I just felt uncomfortable. She told me not to flat iron it but when I got home I had to! Because all the hair is basically one length and I have a ton of hair it was way too bulky at the ends. I'm going to have to flat iron it until it's longer and I can get better layers into it. All in all this was an awful experience for me and I now have to find a new colorist as well as wait for my hair to grow back.

Yesterday I called and left a message for the owner. She called a couple hours later and I explained everything. Prior to her call I found a yelp review from another woman who had a bad experience with Tanya as well. However when I told this to the owner she said that she hadnt seen any bad yelp reviews and she's very surprised to hear that I wasn't happy because according to all the other girls in the salon, I was. Clearly if I had loved the outcome I wouldn't be calling to complain, I'd be booking my next appointment. She refused to do any kind of refund but offered to do my hair herself. So I drove the 45 minute drive to Gilbert from Maricopa only to find out her recommendation is to leave my hair alone. She offered to put in highlights but the issue wasn't the level of color, it was the tone I hated. Being an orangy/yellow instead of an ash is what bothered me. My hair looked better before it was ever touched by them. I had worked so hard at getting the brassiness out and now it was back. I showed her several reference pictures, the same pictures I showed Tanya and again was told my hair looked like the pictures. No it didn't. She kept saying that the color is beautiful, but it wasn't to me. I asked if she could put a nice brunette color over the orange and just leave the blonde pieces alone but was told that she knew I wanted to be blonde so she was hesitant on making me darker. I felt like I kept getting excuses and just gave up. I don't like arguing with people. She made me feel like it was my fault that I got this color. She said I was so dark when I came in. I told her I wasnt dark, I was quite blonde. I showed her a picture that I took on Monday and she questioned the time frame of my picture as if I was showing her an old one or something. As far as the cut she apologized that it wasn't the cut I wanted but according to the other girls in the salon apparently it was. Shoulder length hair isn't long hair. Again I was made to feel it was my issue. She offered me back my gratuity and $20 off my next service with her. I was fighting back tears. You know those people that will argue and demand things, etc... yeah that's not me. I'm an introvert, a suffer in silence kind of personality. Another thing is Tanya was in the salon and instead of apologizing or trying to make things right, she wore a girly, sparkly baseball type hat and would hold the bill of her hat down when she walked by me, as if I couldn't see it was her! Seriously!?  I took a shower this morning and was combing out my hair and noticed a huge gap in my cut!!! I couldn't believe it. I thought maybe I parted it weird, nope, it's parted where I always part it. So then I went back and looked at pictures I had text to my mom and there it was! A gap in the cut! I didn't even notice it when I took the picture! And what's more is that the owner touched and looked at my hair several times and she didn't notice it either.  I'm sure somehow the gap in my cut is my fault as well. So even though the color is not at all what I wanted, the cut is awful and the service wasn't great either but I'm not entitled to a full refund? Completely unacceptable!! I'm so done with this salon and won't ever return. If you value your long hair don't go here. If you like butchered hair then by all means go for it.  When I flat ironed my hair, it looks so ridiculous. It looks like I gave scissors to a child and let them have at it. I'm so upset. One side is straight but uneven and chunky and the other is completely chopped up... I'm going to have to clip my hair back for months until it grows long enough that I can cut the excess to match. Lovely.. Worst anniversary weekend ever!  Then I got a voicemail from Stephanie, the owner, who told me due to my Yelp review I'm no longer welcome at her salon. So apparently instead of acting like a professional she's taking this personally. She doesn't want to admit that her associate ruined my hair and wants to believe her salon is perfect. That's fine. After how I've been treated I would never go back. I called my bank who refunded me the amount I lost and she'll have to deal with them who will be calling her to collect my loss. I also put a complaint on BBB and with the board of cosmetology. This is not a place of professionalism or has any consideration for their clients but only their pockets. Beware of giving any criticism, they'll inform you that you are not welcome to return. Very sad.

This morning we decided to give this place a try after reading the positive Yelp reviews. Our experience was...okay. Nothing horrible but nothing great either.  I got the traditional eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Irish eggs Benedict. It was good, a little lacking in flavor but okay. The potatoes, however, were extremely bland and lacking of any seasoning. I needed to add salt and pepper to my entire meal, which came from these dirty looking tin cans sitting on the table. I noticed the portion of potatoes they gave us was extremely small, I felt gypped! I almost said something but decided not to make a fuss over it. The waitress brought us a glass jar filled with ketchup for the potatoes...I didn't like this at all. The jar had some dried ketchup on the underneath side of the glass lid and it just looked greasy on the outside with finger prints all over it. It just bothered me. I know they're trying to be cute and unique but really just leave it in the original ketchup bottle.  Also this isn't a large eatery, with only about 10 tables. The size doesn't exactly bother me but when you have a baby at the next table screaming, the entire room gets tense, you can actually feel it. But it's not the size of the room its how they use the space. The Farm House in Gilbert is also a very small space but it is extremely warm and inviting, Mark's Cafe lacks this.  FYI, if you haven't tried The Farmhouse off of Gilbert just south of Guadalupe, please do, it's incredible, but get there before 8AM or you'll be waiting in a line that goes around the building! Wonderful place!  Just a side note if the owners ever read their Yelp reviews. We noticed they were playing religious music, which didn't bother us even though we're not religious, but for the sake of respecting EVERYONE who comes into your place of business it would be a good idea to be neutral so you don't lose customers.   All in all this place was mediocre at best. I definitely felt it was over priced for what you get. Service was fast and friendly so that was a plus. However, knowing that I can get better quality, better tasting food, with cheaper prices elsewhere has me thinking we may not be back. We often go to Crackers Cafe on Elliot and Priest which is excellent. We've been there over a dozen times and every time it's a win. Wonderful food, great environment, friendly staff, and prices that make you feel like you're getting a great deal. Mark's Cafe is over priced with a lack of comfort in their decor and food.

I am so happy I found Kevin for my home inspection. I'm purchasing a home and needed someone on my behalf to let me know if this home is sound and safe. Kevin showed up early and did a very thorough job. He gave me a full report of everything he found including pictures. He went through his findings with me and explained everything in detail in layman's terms so I understood. Kevin was very friendly and really great to work with. I would absolutely recommend him for your home inspections. I now feel confident in my choice with this home.

Wow! Now I understand the 5 star rating! This place is fantastic! It's was girl's night, so my bestie and I came here for a sweet treat after eating a yummy dinner at Costa Vida. The line really wasn't long when we entered the shoppe but there were tons of people outside and inside enjoying their cold gelatos during this blistering Arizona heat wave. We were greeted by smiling faces who offered us samples; the gelato was so airy! I opted for the mint chocolate chip and my friend had the cheesecake. We paid, we picked a table, and then we were in gelato heaven. I've had gelato at other places but theirs is at an entirely different level. It's extremely light in your mouth, and so airy and creamy. Another plus is they have a staff member walking around offering cold water to guests. I love this! Other ice cream, yogurt, and gelato shops purposely only have bottled water so you have to purchase it. Frost seems to focus more on their service, your experience, and their wonderful gelato. It's funny, because when other Yelpers mention you will never want ice cream again, it's true!!

Came here since we were in Tempe down the street from Mill.  It has a trendy atmosphere; clean, cement floors, wooden tables, bare but with large, interesting art pieces. Inside was spacious and clean. Service was friendly. You order at a counter, seat yourself, and they'll bring your food out when it's ready.  We both ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict. Both meals were wonderful. Thick slices of ham, eggs cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was perfectly seasoned. Fried potatoes came with the eggs and they tasted so good they didn't need any seasoning or ketchup, etc...  Our experience was great! We'd definitely come back when we're nearby.

Like many places in Maricopa this is another eatery that falls short.   The food was so-so. We both ordered chicken sandwiches that came with fries. The chicken was dried out and cold, and the fries were exactly like McDonald's...eh. The service was decent, although our food went to the wrong table and was left there until the customers let them know it wasn't theirs. It was then brought to our table. Hmmm....eh...okay so I'm somewhat of a germaphobe! I don't want my food sitting at another table. I am aware that those people's table very well may have been cleaner than the kitchen but I couldn't see the kitchen so...  We did like the decor and the environment. They have a few billiards tables and a handful of tv's with sports and movies playing. They have a patio which is nice but apparently smoking is allowed because it was coming in through the door and into the restaurant. Not okay with that...  Would we go back? Maybe... just for one more try. Although I would lower my expectations.

Honestly I don't even feel like taking the time to write a review for this place but I have to warn others. Seriously... So my friend and her boyfriend invited us to join them for dinner since we drove out to Queen Creek to see their new house. As soon as we walked in I got uncomfortable. It just smelled off and looked like the establishment wasn't being cared for. We got some food but there was a lot of choices that looked questionable and I wouldn't trust so I felt very limited. I only chose things that looked either fully cooked Or something that I knew shouldn't be spoiled. Our friends started acting a bit odd and hinted we should really leave. My boyfriend and I were done anyhow because the food wasn't good at all. So when we get outside they tell us that while we were getting our food the family a few booths down actually started throwing up! They said the servers were rushing over to get it cleaned up quickly. I have never been to a restaurant where patrons are vomiting immediately after taking a few bites of food. How old or unsanitary can it be for your body to not even try to process what you put in your mouth but instead immediately starts rejecting it. Needless to say I would never ever ever EVER go to this place again. I can't even believe that. Omg no, stay away, stay far away.

Who doesn't like Chipotle? They're always consistently good, the place is clean, and the staff friendly. I like that the food is always fresh, nothing processed. The boyfriend always gets the steak burrito and I tend to always get either a steak bowl or tacos. And I'm basically addicted to that corn salsa. You can't really go wrong by eating here.

Hobby Lobby is my drug of choice. I basically decorated my home with 90% Hobby Lobby. The staff is always friendly, they have great deals, its clean, and its really large.

We decided to give this place a try last night since they opened almost a year ago and we hadn't been in. Plus we just wanted a fast cheap meal without having to cook and without having to eat at McDonald's or Wendy's. Upon entering we were asked if this was our first time and had the whole menu explained to us. The burgers are cooked very thin on purpose and they offer shoe string fries or onion rings to go with them. They also have hot dogs and chicken choices. We both ordered a burger, fries, and a drink. Prices aren't bad, they're about average. We had a 25% off coupon so it was just over $10. After you order they offer you some fry sauce and have a special seasoning blend you can sprinkle onto your food. Everything was great! The burgers were very tasty as are the fries. Actually we both really loved the fries! They do offer frozen custard with lots of toppings to choose from. We didn't get any. We're the kind of people that are always blown away by prices for ice cream at eateries and would rather just buy it at the grocery store. Anyhow, we'll definitely be back. It's a nice change from the usually fast food joints.

By now we've visited Freddys at least a dozen times or more. The staff is always friendly, the environment is always clean and upbeat, and the food is always consistently good. Fyi, we're pretty addicted to their fries, not sure why but they're so damn good. Maybe the seasoning is laced with crack, I don't know but they're awesome!

I'm stuck between 2 and 3 stars...2 1/2 stars if I could. We decided to give Can't Stop Smokin a try since I had a gift certificate from work.  The atmosphere is actually really comfortable and nicely decorated to go with their BBQ theme. It's sort of cafeteria style; grab a metal tray, place your order and they'll bring it to you at the end of the line where you pay, and seat yourself.  We both ordered the #3 combos which comes with two meats, corn on the cob, two sides, dinner rolls and a drink. It's a lot of food! We could have easily shared one plate. I got the pulled pork, and the sausage. He got the brisket and sausage. For our sides we both had the baked beans and the garlic buttered potatoes. I read in other reviews the mashed are box potatoes, so I knew I wouldn't be getting any of that, I can't stand box mashed potatoes with their grainy off texture. Also...when we were looking at the sides they were offering, we saw a hair in their mashed potatoes. Yikes...  Service here was really friendly. Everyone seemed helpful and happy to be there.  The food was...okay. The sausage was moist and had some flavor, as was the pulled pork and brisket. Their BBQ Sauce I'm not a fan of. I didn't like the spicy one at all it just tasted weird, and the regular one had too much vinegar in it which gives it an almost alcohol taste. The baked beans were eh...not great but ok, just like their other dishes. The garlic potatoes I'm pretty sure are frozen and reheated. They don't taste fresh at all. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to them to get any flavor. The corn on the cob piece was pretty good. Juicy and they add butter to it. Also their dinner rolls are really good, they're basic but they were fresh, and soft so I really liked them. For dessert we shared the apple cobbler since other Yelpers seemed to enjoy it and it was tasty. We both agreed the best tasting things on our plates were the rolls and apple cobbler.  Overall this place is decent enough, but it's overpriced compared to the quality you get. Those sides truly are poor quality, I don't think anything is made fresh, or if it is, they freeze it and reheat which downgrades the food because nothing reheated will ever taste fresh. Like I said, we only came here because we had a $10 off coupon. We're HUGE fans of Rudy's, who is literally right next door, it's a regular place for us so I think we'll stick with them instead but I'm glad we gave this place a try. If you haven't tried Rudy's you should; good prices, flavorful food, excellent BBQ sauce, and much better quality.

This review is strictly for their grooming area.  We came here a couple months ago (I kept forgetting to write my review) and took our 7 year old boxer for a grooming session. All we wanted was his nails clipped and a shampoo/dry. Firstly we got attitude from the larger lady behind the counter especially about our dogs vaccinations. She didn't know how to read the paperwork from the vet showing he just received his vaccinations and it's good for three years. It clearly showed the date we got them and how long they were good for but she kept arguing with me about it. Finally once I got her to understand she seemed to reluctantly put this info in their system. It was like she wanted to be able to reject our pup so she wouldn't have to deal with another dog on a Saturday. Next I talked to them about his nails. They needed to be clipped but earlier that morning he had torn one at the dog park and they refused to touch it. It wasn't bleeding or anything it just needed to be trimmed and shaped so it was smooth. She acted like this was a huge deal as if I asked her to do surgery on his nail. Lol Honestly this woman was ridiculous. You're a groomer don't you see torn, messed up nails all the time? Deal with it, geez!   No one explained the process or gave us a wait time or anything even knowing we had never been to Petsmart for their grooming salon before. I assumed since an appointment had been made that once we brought him they would immediately take him and get started. This wasn't the case. We waited and waited and waited and waited....our boxer sat in a crate for nearly 3 hours before anyone did anything with him.  Finally after 3  1/2 hours they said he was ready. FYI, I know he sat in a crate for 3 hours before they did their half hour of work because his crate was right by the door they were walking in and out of and we could see him. Anyhow, I don't know what they did but he was terrified!!! He was shaking involuntarily and his eyes were huge, he looked completely spooked!! Our boxer is an extremely gentle soul and it was clear that whoever handled him was being overly harsh. I will never take him to this location ever again. They clearly didn't care about us or the fact that they're supposed to be caring for our dog.

I bought a few gift cards from my work for a few restaurants because they finally got rid all the restrictions, including an automatic 18% gratuity. ATL Wings was one of them.  We checked out their website before going there for dinner. For me, I am able to judge a company's professionalism by taking a glance at what promotes them on the web. In addition, we wanted to see what the menu looked like. The website is pretty basic but what bothered me were all the spelling and grammar mistakes. Plus it looked like something a complete amateur put together. The menu looked...decent, although everything seemed fried.  We made our way down to the establishment and found it in a worn down shopping area of Chandler. It's a small joint with a handful of tables, which many were full of people. However it didn't seem overly clean. The empty tables and chairs had pieces of food on them from earlier customers and the floor wasn't any better.  I was able to overlook the uncleanliness due to all the people who seemed to be enjoying their food. As we were waiting in line, I noticed a sign that says they will charge an 18% gratuity for any parties over five. Really!?  This isn't even a place where you have actual servers! It's a fast food joint! I think the owners think their establishment is fancier than it truly is. Even though there were only about 4 people in front of us, the wait was nearly 20 minutes just to place an order! It seemed a bit ridiculous. Even with the long line the girl behind the register actually stepped away to get the cooks more sauces. Shouldn't the cooks be doing this?  We finally placed our order; two 6 wing combos and a side of the mac and cheese bites. I handed her our gift certificate and this is where things really start going downhill for us. She was charging me the old 18% gratuity that should have been removed from their system; these restrictions were lifted.  Also, we had already used a couple of the other gift certificates for other restaurants and weren't charged any gratuity. This means the memo was sent out and either the owner of ATL Wings never read it or just ignored it. Based on another reviewer saying that the employees admitted they don't get any of the tips, I'm pretty sure it's the latter. I'm sorry, is this place owned by Amy from Amy's Bakery!? You don't tip out your employees if you're charging tips? Unbelievable...the arrogance of some restaurant owners really shocks me. After trying to explain to the girl that we should not be paying any gratuity the girl said she had to charge it but would remind the owner of the change. Not wanting to seem like a jerk we just paid it and sat down.  After about 10 minutes we finally got our food. If you order a soda don't expect refills because they don't have a soda machine, they just have a bunch of cans in a fridge which you have to pay for individually. Otherwise they have Kool-Aid, that's...interesting. I can see having this available maybe if this was some sort of a children's eatery place like Chuck E. Cheese or Peter Piper pizza, but otherwise I don't see why having an overly sugary punch is so great. I had the Honey BBQ wings and my boyfriend got the Cajun BBQ wings. They came with ranch, tiny celery sticks and fries. I will say the fries were actually really good! I think they tasted better than anything else we had. The wings were...okay. They had flavor! It's just that we were expecting them to be way better, as if there was going to be this huge WOW factor involved due to the ratings on Yelp. There was nothing special about these wings. In fact, our normal wing place is Native New Yorker and I definitely like theirs much better. At NNY there is a large variety to choose from; more unique, fun flavors verses ATL wings that seem to have just hotter versions of others. In addition, NNY allows you to mix as many flavors as you like. So if you want one wing of every flavor, they'll do it! Not at ATL. At least for the combos, you only get to pick one flavor. Come on, that's the best part of wings; trying multiple flavors!  My wings seemed a bit over cooked, as the outsides were too crunchy for me.  While their wings were decent enough the mac and cheese bites were absolutely awful! They were square shaped with overly flat bottoms. This tells me they are bought and frozen, and then deep fried when ordered. So they're not even making them fresh. This explains why these particular appetizers are terribly bland. There is absolutely zero seasoning. I ate one and my boyfriend had a bite of another, the rest were thrown in the trash. What a waste!  The quality here is extremely low, and I'm really surprised this place is being raved about on Yelp. I would highly suggest trying Native New Yorker; we go to the one in Ahwatukee off of Ray and the I-10. At least here you'll get true service, with much better quality, free refills, and where multiple flavors of wings can be ordered.

UPDATE!!! Lowering my review to 1 star, I'd give zero stars if I could. I explained in my first review how I purchased a gift certificate through my work's discount program for employees and a newly changed policy is to no longer charge the 18% gratuity. However when I came to ATL Wings on Friday they forced me to pay that gratuity. My work contacted them about illegally charging me and ATL Wings actually gave push back! Now keep in mind the company I work for is not some tiny little nothing business; it's the largest corporation in the world for it's industry and ATL Wings is so arrogant they think this may not effect them. Let me tell you ATL Wings, in my building alone, I work with nearly 2000 people, who most of which reside in Mesa, Gilbert, and Chandler; word of mouth is a very powerful tool. This restaurant is now being reported to www.Restaurant.com to be taken off of the program for employees to purcahse gift certificates! Clearly they have no respect for their customers. They only want as many dollars as they can get, even if this means going against contracts they sign with other companies and ignoring policies that are given.

LAST UPDATE!!!  I got an email from restaurant.com this morning, it's official! Since ATL Wings doesn't know how to respect  their customers and they ignored their contract and policies with restaurant.com, they have been removed from the discount program. I was allowed to get another certificate to a different restaurant in exchange for the hassle we went through.   ATL Wings, my employer gave you the opportunity to fix this but you decided that it's more important to overcharge your customers with invalid fees just so you can keep the extra cash. You took the gamble and you lost on this one.

We've gone here twice and both times is was great!! If you're brand new to Rudy's, let them know and they'll have someone come and explain the whole menu and how it works. They'll also let you sample the different meats before you purchase!  The atmosphere: It's very casual and friendly. They have huge metal containers with ice holding beers, sodas, and other fun drinks. (FYI, if you don't want the glass bottled sodas they do have regular cups and a self serve soda fountain.) Large picnic tables are placed in rows in the main dinning area as well as on their patios. Fun, vintage metal signs adorn the walls giving it a more country laid back kind of look. They also have flat screen TVs hanging around the dinning area to watch whatever game is on.  The Service: The first time we went everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The second time we were also greeted with smiles. The guy who took our order seemed a little grumpy but towards the end of our order he gave a big smile. I think he was just focusing on the order to make sure it was correct. Either way he didn't ruin our experience.  The Food: Both times the food has been delicious. The meat is tender and seasoned very well. I will say on our first visit my corn on the cob was over cooked but this last time I got the cream of corn and it was delicious!! And it is NOT like cream of corn from a can, do try there's, it's wonderful. The spicy chop and sausage is very tasty. My hubby loves the brisket! Next time I'm going to try their chicken. The new potatoes are great but if you get the butter on them they do put ALOT of butter, so maybe ask for them to go light on the butter. My hubby likes their potato salad, which is in the fridge near the front of the line, and he enjoys the corn as well. They only have two BBQ sauces to choose from, which are on all the tables, but both are tasty. One is  a little sweeter then the other and is always my choice. Know that when eating in the restaurant your meats will be placed on wax paper. At first I thought it was odd but after sitting down it just adds to their atmosphere and their meat is so tender that using the plastic forks and knives hasn't been an issue. As far as dessert I believe they have puddings and pies in the fridge but we've never had their desserts.  The ONLY bad thing I can honestly think of is the bread. They'll ask you if you want some bread to go with your meal for free but don't expect homemade rolls. It's actually sliced bread from a bag, just like what you buy at the grocery store. This is my reason for the 4 stars. They really should be baking their own rolls. The first time we did accept the bread not knowing but this last time we didn't bother with it.  Overall it's a great place for some yummy BBQ with a laid back atmosphere and the prices are well worth it.

We just love this place so much! Had another delicious bbq meal yesterday. We seem to have our favorites now. He always gets a huge brisket sandwich and the green chili stew, and I always get the half sausage, new potatoes, and cream of corn. *drool*   Oh! We also just found out they give military discounts for active or retired!  Service - excellent, food - wonderful, atmosphere - fun! This has become one of our favorite places.

Eh....what more can I say then that.  Very bland, tries to model themselves like chipotle but nothing like chipotle...not good, not good at all. We'd rather go to Taco's N More or just drive to Chandler and get Chipotle or drive to Ahwatukee for The Burrito Company.

Prior to a very late dinner we stopped here to take some desserts to go so we could enjoy them after dinner! Most people were getting ice cream but we purchased 3 decadent desserts! A dessert called Intense with rich chocolate and a pink French macaron topping it, a white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake, and a double chocolate mousse.  After our late dinner at Noodles we headed back to our hotel room and enjoyed these as a happy birthday treat for my boyfriend. They were beyond amazing! All of them were rich and melt in your mouth delicious.  We will absolutely make our back here next time we visit Vegas.

My hubbs and I ate here last Friday and were pleasantly surprised! We had received a coupon in the mail and decided to try them out. Walking in the décor was lovely; very modern and sleek looking. The service was great! And the food was delicious! My hubby had the marinara penne pasta with sausage and I had the garlic and white wine penne pasta with mushrooms and asparagus. You are given free bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which is very tasty. The restaurant is clean, service is very friendly, food is good and the atmosphere would be great for dinner or lunch.

We decided to eat here last week since we had only been the one time and wanted to try them again. Ugh, it wasn't good. We ordered a couple dishes to-go and it was completely over priced for what we got and the food was flavorless! I was so disappointed since when we first tried Babbo's we had a great experience. We probably won't be back. We'll just stick to Oregano's or RigaTony's since we always have a good time at those restaurants.

Okay, so I'm raising my rating back up. Babbo sent us a gift card to come back after our terrible experience with out last take out order. So last night we finally decided to use the gift card and give them another try.   We got our food to go and it was great! I had the spring mix salad with mozzarella instead of feta, and the classic spaghetti and meatballs, and my BF got a Cesar salad and with his Italian pasta. They also gave us two squares of bread with oil and vinegar.  The spring mix salad was fantastic! I could have had a huge bowl of that and I'm not usually a big fan of salads. My spaghetti was also really really good. It came super hot with two giant meatballs, the pasta was cooked well and it had a really good amount of sauce which I like; I hate dry pastas. The only small complaint I had is about the sautéed mushrooms I added to my pasta. I was expecting thick slices of large mushrooms, but instead they were these tiny pieces; no bigger or thicker than my pinky nail. So it didn't seem worth it to pay extra for sautéed mushrooms. My boyfriend made no complaints about his meal and also really enjoyed it.  All in all the meal was wonderful and we'll definitely be going back now.

We actually avoided coming here until the reviews were better. When Porkopolis first opened Yelpers didn't like care for it much but that often happens with a new restaurant. It takes time for everyone to get down a smooth running process. I'm so glad we waited because tonight was great!  We were seated within a few minutes, greeted and had our drink order taken. Our server was pleasant and she took our food order; pulled pork sandwich for me, and the brisket french dip for my hubby. Fries on the side.  While we waited we took note of the decor; rustic "gas" lamps hanging around the room, fun large pieces of wall art, the tables were of smooth, dark, large planked wood, tv's above the bar, and a bar height seating area in front of the kitchen. It was clean and everyone was busy. Our food came out and it looked wonderful. It was of a great portion. We tested a little of the bbq sauces available on the table. Of course he liked the spicy one, and I preferred the sweet. We both were "mmmm"ing in our first few bites. The food was delicious. Both of our meats were moist and the bbq sauce was fantastic. The bread of the buns were soft and warm. The fries were seasoned well, and even the Cokes really hit the spot to wash everything down.  I feel we got a fantastic meal for the price. We had an excellent time and look forward to our next visit!

Let me just say that if I was ever in a burger rehab therapy clinic these would be the burgers I'd want for my meds. I bookmarked this place on Yelp a long time ago but since we live in Maricopa and work in Chandler we rarely ever venture to Scottsdale. But the other day we were like "F-it, let's do it!"  There were no wait times when we arrived, which is nice. They have patio seating but the décor was so fun we opted to sit inside. This place was completely decked out in beach décor. We truly felt like we were sitting in one of our favorite food shacks in San Diego off mission beach. We ordered some chips and salsa to start since we had our Check-In coupon from Yelp. If you've read my other reviews you know how super picky I am about chips AND salsa. To my surprise both were great!! Usually there is always one I'm a little "eh" about but at Rehab both were really good! For the burgers I ordered the Hawaiian Burger and added guacamole and my boyfriend got the Ghost Burger and we both decided to try their sweet poTOToes. (Yes that's how it's spelt!) Holy beefy amazingness batman! These burgers were delicious! They were perfectly cooked to order and I love the traditional buns they use. The tots came with this chipotle aioli sauce that was a "I'm-ganna-just-drink-this-sh*t" kind of good. My only regret is not being able to finish all my food! You know where you're eating and you know you're too full but you keep saying to yourself "just one more bite..." Yeah...that was me. It was so good but it was so much food. We all know burgers and fries/tater tots don't reheat well at all so I knew even though I was taking leftovers it wouldn't get eaten. So sad... At least my boyfriend ate all of his. Service was great too! Drinks always stayed filled, food came out at a normal time frame and the staff was very friendly. Overall this was fantastic experience and we'll definitely be making our back here soon with some friends. So should you go here? Yes. Should you come hungry? Yes. Should you expect to feel like an overstuffed thanksgiving turkey ready to bust? Yes. Will you love it? Absolutely.

I was a patient of Sarah's years ago and really liked her a lot. My mom also goes to her regularly too. Well I needed to get into a dermatologist for some odd red skin issue I'm having. I called to make an appointment today and they didn't have any openings until October. Umm its June...yeah that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard! If you have that many patients maybe you should extend some of your hours. Patients shouldn't have to wait 5 months just to see a physician. Unacceptable. I called another reputable dermatologist in the area with better reviews then this skin center and I have an appointment tomorrow.

I ate here a couple Saturdays ago and loved it! The rolls we had were fantastic. We enjoyed the dragon roll, Las Vegas roll, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, and probably a couple others I'm not thinking of. We also shared several edamame plates. Also they had no problem filling a request for a specific kind of roll we wanted to try. The server kept our drinks filled and was very friendly and courteous. Everything tasted very fresh. The raw rolls were nicely chilled and the fried tempura rolls were obviously warm. Personally I loved the atmosphere. Other people commented on it being too plain or like a cafeteria. I feel they went for a more modern and fun look rather than the obvious traditional decor. They have Japanese lanterns hanging from the ceiling, and a large art piece hanging on the far wall. The tables are fun with their black glittered tops that are surrounded by orange cushioned chairs. Lighten up people, sometimes less is more. It's very clean inside which is nice because it allows you to become comfortable quickly so you can start enjoying your experience. Oh, and I do feel this place is much better than Teharu. This is a great place to come with a couple friends to chat, enjoy sushi, and have a relaxing dining experience. I'm really looking forward to my next visit!

We continue to make this place our sushi location of choice. Last night we went with another couple and had an amazing time. Fantastic Las Vegas Rolls, amazing Caterpillar Rolls, and some wonderful Dragon Rolls. I love their unagi, it just melts in your mouth.   Service, as always is extremely friendly, a little slow with bringing the check, but they are so pleasant and helpful. They're quick on refilling drinks and making sure you're happy. Also the place is CLEAN! I love when I can sit down and nothing looks gritty, oily, or has food particles left on the table or seats. Seksun is always kept very clean.  What we love most about Seksun (other than their food) is they prepare their shellfish items separate from the non-shellfish items. My hubby is allergic to shellfish and constantly deals with cross contamination issues with places like Kona Grill, and Teharu, but not at Seksun. We can enjoy our entire meal and he can pick and choose what we wants without worrying about having an allergic reaction.   Love this place so much and always look forward to going here. We've become regulars and visit at least a few times a month.

We just had another wonderful experience. You know you visit a restaurant quite a bit when the server knows your order! It made us laugh, and we were impressed by their memory. Definitely try Seksun, they have melt in your mouth Vegas rolls, Caterpillar rolls, and more. Also if you were one of those that came here when they first opened give them another try. Tonight we noticed the service is faster, which prior it was a bit slow. Also they now offer a happy hour every day from 5pm to 7pm where they're offering $1 appetizers, and .50c off all their sushi! Oh! And we noticed a handful of new sushis we've never seen before. Support one of your local Arizona businesses! :)

We came here the day after thanksgiving for lunch. Super long line! After waiting for an hour and knowing it would be another hour wait (plus we had a show to go to) we decided to pay the extra $20 bucks per person and just get inside!  Oh wow, so much amazing food! I had mainly thanksgiving food since on Thanksgiving day we ate at an Italian place in Ceasars, which was very good actually. Let's see there was turkey, sausage, prime rib, candied yams, glazed carrots,  green beans, mashed potatoes, and more! It was all delicious. My boyfriend also had some of the thanksgiving fare as well as some sliders, pizza and he really enjoyed the brisket.  I was most excited about the freshly steamed crab legs! Yep...I will admit I had two plates. They were delicious! You bring them a clean plate and they will hand you back your plate full of piping hot crab legs! They had little cups of melted butter just off to the side. I also grabbed some lemon wedges and squeezed the lemon on the crab meat before dipping into the butter. Omg heaven!  For desserts I believe I tried their tiramisu, creme brulle, and a chocolate mousse. My boyfriend had a raspberry dessert, a piece of tropical cake and I believe something chocolate...he always gets something chocolate. Lol Everything was wonderful.  This will become a buffet we visit every time we're in Vegas!

This past Friday I decided to try Cane's on my break because coworkers have said how good this place was. Well let me just say, fighting all the traffic near ASU, while the Tempe Arts Festival was taking place and University shrinking down to one lane was well worth it! Plus even after my 15 minute drive back to work my food was still hot.  I got the 3 Chicken Finger combo which came with fries, Texas toast, Cane sauce and a drink. It was probably the best chicken fingers I've ever had!  The chicken fingers are made with 100% never frozen chicken tenderloins which is marinated for 24 hours so they come out extremely moist. They're perfectly seasoned and breaded, not too much and not too little. The cane sauce is so yummy.  It tastes like it has ketchup, mayo, worcestershire, seasonings but I'm not sure what else is in it, however its excellent, you have to try it! The Texas toast had a crisp outer crust but is soft inside. It was buttered and wonderful. The fries were pretty good basic fries; salted and crinkle cut.  I highly recommended trying Raising Cane's if you've never been!

We tried this place a few days ago for a quick dinner and we both really liked it!   The experience is interesting. You choose one of the brown paper bags based on which type of meat you want and using a red sharpie you fill out what toppings you'd like on the sandwich.   What I like most about Which Wich, compared to other sub shops, is they have a ton to choose from. Most places have lettuce, tomato, peppers and sometimes pickles. Which Wich has 54 different options for your sandwich! Multiple cheeses, sauces, veggies, dressings, and more. In addition, they have unique sandwich choices like crab salad, buffalo shrimp, egg salad, chicken salad, meatball, breakfast sandwiches and the list goes on!   You can also create a bowl instead of a sandwich to cut out the carbs that bread contains. Or if you want the bread but just not all of it, try it Skinny style and they'll pull out the middle of your bread so your sandwich is made between the outer crusts.   They also have chips, cookies, and milkshakes for their side options.  Give them try!

This was a very fun and interesting place. We went for lunch I believe during the week so it really quiet. We shared the tostada appetizer and then shared the apocalypse sow pork burger. Both were very tasty! Service was really great too, they were attentive and friendly. The only thing I would say is the prices seemed a bit high for the portion size they gave you. Other than that our experience was great and we'd go back to try some more options.

I'm actually surprised by the higher ratings. We didn't think it was that great.   The staff wasn't very knowledgeable about the sushi or the menu items. Anything we asked the response we got was in a bubbly voice of "I don't know!" While I appreciate her friendliness and upbeat attitude I felt she should know more about the sushi and the dishes they serve.   My boyfriend got the orange glaze chicken. It was...okay, but definitely way over priced for what you got. $8.50 for that dish and it was mostly rice and a salad with a bit of chicken. The small salad was depressing looking with the unknown orange sauce (again, the server didn't know what it was but laughed about it). My BF didn't eat it so we're still not sure what it was but it resembled thousand island.  The sushi wasn't good either. Now we do have some friends who loved their sushi which is why we tried Eastwind's but for us it truly fell short. We arrived right when they opened so all the sushi should have been prepared fresh and it definitely wasn't. The Tempura was complete mush and the tastes just seemed truly off. The flavors didn't blend and melt in your mouth at all. I did enjoy the New York Crunch Roll, I believe was the name. It was the one great roll in a line of unsatisfactory rolls. The other sushi rolls were tasteless, mushy and seemed to have been from the prior day.  Our favorite place is Seksun Sushi Go-Round on Ray, just west of Alma School. We have been there over a dozen times and we've never been disappointed. Give Seksun a try!

Can't get any better then a QT. Always clean, staff is always friendly, food choices and quality are great with good prices. Plus, I don't know what it is but I always feel safe at a QT no matter what time of day or night I'm there. QT for the win! :)

We came here on a whim because we had no idea what else we wanted for lunch. The gyros were, I think, better than Niros Gyros. Their portions are huge and everything is really tasty. I liked trying the different hummus's and the baba ganoush. The owner was really cool. He let us try a sample of the cucumber lemonade. Wow that stuff is amazing!! The only disappointing things were my boyfriend wanted fries and they were out and the prices were very high for a fast food type joint. We'd come back for sure next time we're in the area but I hope they would lower their prices a bit. That would be the only reason we might pass on them if we didn't feel like spending that much.

We really loved this place! Fresh hot fish tacos, excellent beer battered fries, and a wonderful salsa bar with different salsas and cream based sauces like avocado, chipotle, and cilantro. They also make their own ranch for their fries. The one thing I wish they did was offer flour tortillas instead of just corn; start offering the flour tortillas and it'd be a 5 star from me! Other than that this place was fantastic and we'd definitely be back. Also the staff and owner is very friendly!

Decided to treat myself to a yummy sushi dinner a couple weeks ago (sorry for the delayed review btw). The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and it was quiet, which for me is a plus. It was hard to choose between all the delicious sounding rolls, there were so many wonderful choices! I decided on the Snow White and the Volcano. Wow were these rolls amazing. My only complaint is that I couldn't finish both by myself! Lol I can't wait to go back. Plus they assured me that if I let them know about my boyfriend's shellfish allergy they'll make sure to avoid cross contamination. Fyi, it's hard to find really good sushi in az and my boyfriend and I love a couple sushi places in San Diego but this place is very comparable.

We've been here enough times that I can update this review. This place is so damn good! Our last experience was a little disappointing because my boyfriend got a cross contamination allergy reaction but I blame us for that. We should have reminded them that he needs his sushi prepared away from any shellfish. We've basically tried all the sushi rolls that are without shrimp. All wonderful! They even told us we could always pick any roll we wanted and they could swap out the shrimp for another type of fish. Very cool. We'll be back for sure!

Still loving this place and their yummy sushi. You really can't go wrong here and it's a great place if you want more of a quiet experience because it always seems to be a relaxed environment when I come here. I will continue to come here for sure!!!

I've got to help keep the trend of these awesome reviews going! We decided to go here for lunch with the recommendation of a friend plus the Yelp reviews and we're glad we did.  The atmosphere was lovely. It's a small place with bright orange walls and colorful lanterns. It was clean too. The staff was friendly and very willing to answer questions about the dishes.  The food was very good!  We shared some orange chicken and Cantonese fried noodles with bbq pork. We also had two pork egg rolls. Our only complaint was the egg rolls. We were expecting hearty egg rolls with lots of pork. What we got was very tiny egg rolls and that didn't seem to have any pork in them at all. Its possible they accidentally gave us spring rolls. They were still tasty though.  Even though we live all the way in Maricopa (ugh...) we'll still make sure we come back. It'll probably become our go-to place for some Asian dishes.

What more can I add to all the other reviews? I originally went to Snooze in San Diego (check out my review!) so when I saw that they came to Phoenix I had to try them, of course.  Snooze is an excellent place for an amazing breakfast. I always get a half order of the eggs benedict and then share a flight of pancakes because o.m.g. they're amazing! The pineapple upside down pancake...wow....could there a better pancake? NO! But the chocolate chip comes in right behind it. Also what I love are their hash browns because unlike other restaurants Snooze actually seasons their hash browns wonderfully. I generally hate hash browns and avoid getting them but at Snooze I have to have them! You can order anything and won't be disappointed. Service is always great and the place is really comfortable and clean. This place is a winner for sure! Oh! And if you're going for someone's birthday breakfast, quietly tell your server and he'll bring out a birthday festive pancake with a candle! Very cool.

Tried Joyride for a late night taco dinner. The atmosphere was very hip and trendy, fun and inviting. We almost felt like we were back in San Diego! The wait was a bit long but we found out it was worth the wait. The staff was very friendly as well. They have delicious chips and salsa, we couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend ordered three of the beer battered fish tacos and I ordered three tacos as well, beer battered fish, Carnitas, and chicken. For our side dishes my boyfriend had black beans and I had the orange and cucumber salad. I thought the Carnitas and fish tacos were fantastic although I didn't care for the chicken. My boyfriend said the black beans were fine and my salad was okay. I put a little salt and pepper on it to make it less bland, maybe more than two mini oranges? We did feel the prices were a little high for tacos. However, because the tacos and chips and salsa were so tasty we would absolutely recommend this place, we'll definitely be back!

Pretty dang good! We had the house special but added pineapple and took off the ground beef. A little ranch on the side and our meal was delicious. I normally only get thin crust pizzas because I don't like all that breading but their crust was really good. It has a buttery sweetness but with a wonderful crispy texture. Mmm! Next time I really want to try one of their salads too. For me, pizza and salad are the perfect couple. We'll definitely be coming back here again.

Yeah... no thanks! After the sales woman Susan introduced herself she asked what we were looking for and I told her"just looking". She said that she would leave us alone while we looked. Omg! We felt like we were prey and she was stalking us. Everywhere we went I could see her watching us and standing just feet away. Really? Leave us alone! I kept avoiding eye contact hoping she'd get the point. Then when my boyfriend and I were discussing a couch she came over and started giving us prices. I told her we needed to discuss it. She just stood there, I told again we needed to discuss and would get back to her. She finally went away. We decided to not buy because we wanted to check out other places. We called her back over and told her this and she said she'd go get her business card. When she came back she told us the manager wanted to know what would make us buy today. I told her "nothing, I want to shop around". She kept trying to push me and i kept telling her no. We finally left and I won't ever go back.

Update! I forgot to add this but the following day I got a call from Susan asking if we were coming back to purchase. I never gave this person my number nor gave permission to be contacted. She took it upon herself to look in their system (because I mentioned I had a Wells Fargo furniture credit card that could be used at Mega Furniture) and she got my number and called me! Completely unprofessional. I called back later and told the woman who answered the phone how inappropriate that was and after I heard her sigh and what I think was a whisper of "ugh...oh my god", she assured I wouldn't get anymore calls. They for sure lost my business.

No... just no. We're trying to find a few pieces of furniture and I was told by a friend to check this place out. We walk in and are attacked by a salesman. I tell him straight out we are ONLY looking. We will NOT be purchasing today. But still he follows us around like a puppy and then was telling us how he's new and he has to follow us but he doesn't want to be one of those pushy salesmen. Omg... just go away. Biggest turn off ever. Then he starts telling us his life story and too much information about his personal life. Wth? Dude, seriously, go away, I don't care about your back problems! We took one lap around that store with our new human-puppy-man and got the hell out of there. Never again. Never ever again.

We gave Chris a call about our 3 year old couch. The cushions had completely gone flat and needed to be restuffed. Within a few days he was able to get us a quote we were comfortable with and have them stuffed and ready to pick up. He also made sure the new foam was higher quality then what came with the couch originally and explained why this was. He perfectly fit the new foam inside the covers so we wouldn't deal with sagging material anymore. We were really impressed with his craftsmanship and professionalism. Plus he was really easy going, we never felt we were dealing with an obnoxious sales person who just wants you to get the most expensive product. We'll definitely be giving him a call for our matching chair cushion once it needs the foam replaced.

After my parents had a good experience with AFW the boyfriend and I decided to take a look. I'm not a fan of chain furniture stores with sales people becoming stalkers so I had my doubts.  I decided to go alone to check the place out before torturing my boyfriend with obnoxious sales people. My first impression was, "Holy shit, this place is huge!" I wandered around and to my astonishment I was not followed, harassed, pressured, or made to feel stupid by any sales people. They simply said hello or asked if I was finding every thing okay. The prices truly are unbelievable. Some of the same sets I've seen either online or in other stores were at least twice if not three times as much then what AFW was selling them for.  So needless to say a couple days later I brought my boyfriend and we looked around for an hour and decided on a couch set for our loft, a leather chair and bookcase for the office and a dining set for the kitchen. Purchasing was extremely easy and fuss free, and delivery can be within two days if it's in stock. Some of our items were available while a few others we had to wait for. But the items that weren't in stock came sooner then expected!   We'll have to see how this furniture holds up, I'm hoing well since it's just my boyfriend and I.

Ugh so greasy... we just ate a pizza and wings from here. It was full of grease, the crust was burnt and the wings seemed barely cooked. I'm pretty sure they use frozen cheese. I've only ever seen cheese crack and crumble like that from a frozen grocery pizza. Plus it's so over priced. I could go to Papa Murphy's and get fresh everything, cook it at home for half the price and it's delicious. Gross, never again.

This place was fantastic! Finally came here with my boyfriend last Friday for dinner and it was sooo good!! You get to create your own personal pizza; sauce, cheese, meats, veggies, etc... I would definitely come back. It can get busy so if you're going for peak lunch or dinner times be prepared to wait. The line moved quickly though. Sorry this isn't a super long review but there isn't much more to say other than get over there and create your own slice of heaven! Ha get it!? lol  ;)

Pretty delicious! We've tried the gilbert location when they first opened and liked it, so we knew it would be good. We came here with another couple to have some drinks and tacos. And boy did we have those drinks and tacos! Lol $58 dollars later, full of tacos and with a tipsy boyfriend it was time to head out. We tried the carnitas, shrimp, carne asada, and crispy fish tacos. All of them were seriously good. My malibu and pineapple drink wasn't something I'd order again...it tasted like I was drinking flowers, it was odd. But my man drank that along with his two long island iced teas which he said was different but still good. Fyi, in the 5 years we've been together I've never seen this man order anything but a good quality beer, so that was strange! After some hilarious and raunchy wonderings of what "white magic" was (remember, tipsy people) we learned it was a delicious lime aioli-baja type sauce. MmmmmMm. Also their chips and salsa are sooooo good! We basically all filled up on that before dinner. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that their sides are very disappointing, nothing special about them at all and everything is a bit pricey here. We'd definitely be back. This is a perfect place for yummy food while you're having some drinks with great friends.

Talk about terrible. Goodness. I came here because my co-workers kept raving about it so I finally decided to try it. Well it's extremely hard to order when the person behind the counter doesn't speak English. She understood Carnitas quesadilla, aaaand that was about it. While pointing and using exaggerated words I got the lady to understand "sour cream". Then I tried to tell her "mild salsa". Omg, what a headache. After saying "mild" eight times she then started pointing to the different salsas and I said, "I don't know which one is the mild." Not sure why I said it, she didn't understand it. She then said, "Hot?" I gestured with my fingers and said, "little hot." It was enough to get some salsa into a little to-go cup. Holy hell. This wouldn't have bothered me as much if I were in some hole in the wall Mexican joint where I know the food is amazing because the recipes are being passed down the generations. But that wasn't the case, I was in a mall for crying out loud!   So I get back to work and open my food. It's dripping, literally, with grease. In fact, it was so greasy that the aluminum paper stuff holding it together tore when I tried to pick it up. I couldn't even stomach eating the last piece. They barely put any Carnitas or cheese in the quesadilla, and they didn't put any of the grilled onions that should have been there either. I paid $7 for this awful Carnitas quesadilla and it didn't come with a drink or sides.   So overall this was truly terrible. I will not be going back. Take your money to a Chipotle since that's who they're trying to copy, or try a different eatery in Az Mills.

Ooooh so *this* is what a great color and cut looks like. After my terrible experience at Savante Salon in Gilbert I wasn't sure anymore.  This afternoon I visited The Pampered Pinkie just so someone could take a look at my ruined hair and see what could be done. I wasn't at all expecting anyone to touch my hair. After my experience at Savante, I was very nervous to let anyone work with my hair. I talked to the owner, Megan (who was dressed up for Halloween!), and told her everything I went through. She was so incredibly nice and completely understood how I felt. She suggested I work with Jackie by correcting the color, the cut and using olaplex to help strengthen the damage that was done to my hair. Jackie had an appointment available as I finished talking to the owner, sooo fate? I don't know but the owner seemed so reassuring I went for it! Jackie and I got to work. Well she worked... I got pampered! We discussed exactly what I wanted and as well as what I didn't want.  While jamming out to some 80's (woot!) music Jackie used more olaplex and rinsed my hair and then she went on to the cutting process. We decided to cut and blow dry my hair without me seeing so I could see the final result when it was all finished. Fun!!! As she cut I started getting really nervous and at one point asked how much she was cutting. She reassured me she was just blending the layers and no length was being taken. Once she completed I couldn't believe it, I was finally an ash blonde with low lights that matched my natural color. This is what I wanted from Savante that they couldn't deliver. And the the cut looked like a professional cut. She styled it straight which is how I like my hair, plus we can check for mistakes easier. Jackie told me to be super picky and anything I saw that I wanted differently she'd do. It looked so amazing! I finally had gorgeous layers that were skillfully blended and my hair no longer felt heavy and bulky. After that I had to give Jackie a big hug!  I no longer have to walk into work every day looking like a barbie doll owned by a 6 year old who likes to play "hair salon" with kitchen scissors. I used my 20% off check-in offer from Yelp, which was great. My entire drive home consisted of me car-dancing to 104.7.  Aside from the great service, cut, color and renewed faith in salons, I had a fantastic experience and can't wait to come back. This is a cute, shabby chic salon that offers hair and nail services. They have a jewelry boutique with super cute finds, essential oils and other goodies. I would highly recommend this salon and Jackie for your hair needs. I hope next time I can try their pedicure services too!

I'm addicted to their white chocolate ice blended coffee drink. I just wished this location opened much earlier like at 5:30am like their Chandler location so I could grab a coffee on the way into work.

Pshh, how can you go wrong with Frost!?? By far, hands down the best gelato, apart from actually going to Italy. I love the location in gilbert, where I've been multiple times, and the Phoenix location is just as good. Lots to choose from, beautifully displayed and taste fantastic. Plus I love that Frost offers free water, unlike other places that charge you. Frost will continue to be my favorite gelato place to visit.

I decided to come here after work for an early dinner. I was craving sushi and saw the yelp reviews were good. I tried their scallop appetizer to start and got two rolls. The appetizer was really very good, it came in a big seashell! I would absolutely get that again. The rolls were ok, nothing amazing but pretty good. I tried two classics; the philly roll and the spicy tuna roll. Both were on their happy hour menu, yay for discounts! They were good but too warm. I expected them to be cold since they weren't baked or fried. That was the only thing I didn't like... which leads me to wonder how cold are they keeping their fish? But I didn't get sick or anything and I'm hoping it was a fluke so I would go back and try them again. Also service was friendly, a little slow, but that was ok, I was enjoying a slow paced evening to start my weekend.

I'm actually surprised by the reviews for this place because it's one of the few decent places Maricopa has. It's not a 5 star place by any means but it's pretty good. If you're needing a Mexican food fix and looking for that heavier Mexican food with chimichangas and refried beans then this is your place. Service is always friendly, the place is clean and the food is pretty good. I like their chips and salsa. Prices are pretty average, nothing overly expensive and the portions are great too. I've been 4 or 5 times now and I haven't had a bad experience yet so I'll continue to go.

Update! Cause we discovered their fajitas! Holy shit, nom nom nom! So now anytime we come here we split some steak and shrimp fajitas. They're very good. They serve them with onions, peppers, mushrooms and a plate with rice, beans and some toppings for the fajitas like cheese, pico, sour cream and guacamole. You can get flour or corn tortillas with them. My only gripe is that the shrimp fajitas only come wth about 6 shrimp, they're large but I wish they came when a few more. Anyhow, really yummy, always enjoy them. Oh! And currently the hours on yelp show they're not open on weekends. That's not true!! I think they're open everyday from 11am-10pm. I put in a request to yelp to change that.

Oh yummy! I really liked this place but I'm surprised by the not so great reviews. We've been a couple times and it's always really tasty. I love the décor and the service is always really friendly. I always get a couple of drum sticks and a waffle. MmmMm! Not much more to say other than I've always had a great experience and look forward to going again soon.

This review is strictly for their grooming salon.  Previously we had taken our 7 Year old boxer, Rosco, to the Gilbert/202 location and we had a terrible experience. However, our experience at this location was completely different. The staff was very friendly and I expressed my concerns due to the Gilbert location upsetting not only us but poor Rosco literally left shaking. They tried to ease our worries and reassured us they would take great care of our dogs (we were also bringing our 12 week old Boston terrier Zeus too). Zeus is still gaining a personality and just loved the attention regardless but Rosco is older and is a gentle soul which the Gilbert location very clearly didn't care about.  The two girls that worked with our dogs (Brittany and... I cant remember the other girls name) were awesome with our pups. They both got spoiled by everyone in the salon, especially Zeus since he's a puppy. This time Rosco left happy and excited. I was amazed at how smooth and clean they got his nose which I struggle with keepnig moist and dirt free. They both smelled great too and each got a cute bandana to take home which they wore for the rest of the day.   We'll defintely be back! FYI, the only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because I think the prices are a bit high for Zeus. I think $25 for Rosco is a great price, he's a 70lb dog but once Zeus hits 4 months (which is next week) he'll also be $25 and I think thats a bit much for a 7lb dog. And even more so I dont like that the nail griding is an extra $12 per dog. Thats way too much. It should either be part of the grooming fee or should only be a few bucks extra. For the amount I have to pay for nail grinding on both of my dogs I could get an entire other dog groomed. lol

Currently eating as I swipe this on my phone and I understand the 5 star rating. The place is very clean, and inviting. It has a hip, city feel to it unlike other gyro places that are in need of an update. I feel like I'm back in Cali or Seattle. Prices are pretty on point so not much to say there. The staff is very friendly and easy going.  So the food... The gyro is really wonderful!! The tzatziki sauce is fantastic. Layered under the shaved meat is onions and sliced tomato. Really delicious. However, my only criticism are the fries. They're very much an after thought. No seasoning, thick starchy pieces of potato. So 4 stars. Next time I'll just have the sandwich alone or try one of their salads. Other than the fries this was an excellent experience. I'd definitely be back. Oooh and they have styrofoam cups! Back to 5 stars! I'm aware they suck for the environment but name another material that keeps your drink cold for literally hours in our Arizona heat. ...Yeah exactly.

Today Chipotle finally opened! Not much to say yet. The line was ridiculously long but moved fairly quickly. The food was delicious and the service was great. So glad we have one in Maricopa!!!

The line was crazy long but it was worth the wait. The subs were delicious. We split an Italian and the Club Supreme. The tables and chairs had food on them but they were so busy they probably didn't have anyone available to keep the dining room clean. Considering the craziness it's forgivable. They have mug root beer yay! But no black olives...ah man. However the bread is really good, nice and soft and the meat is cut fresh. All the veggies were bright and fresh too and they have kettle chips! Score! All in all this place beats out subway any day and firehouse's rich sauces limit my visits so we'll definitely be back to jeresy mikes.

Came back tonight and got the tuna! Sooooo good! Clean, friendly and faster service this time. Giving them 5 stars cause now we'll be regulars. Plus I'm so happy that jersey mikes is giving Maricopa a chance because we need so much more in this city.

This place was just...okay.  Not terrible but nothing spectacular either. The decore and atmosphere was really great! You can tell they put alot of money and work into the place. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food, however, was kind of blah. We did get our meals to go and ate it back in the office, so maybe it was because it wasn't piping hot that it didn't taste so good...? But I doubt it. My two other co-workers messaged me that they also didn't care for it. My onion rings were over cooked and were mostly breading, and my char-grilled chicken sandwich was breaded which I wasn't expecting. All in all this place was decent enough but I'd rather go elsewhere.

Great place! We've been here a few times for sushi before going to tempe imporv to see a comedy show. I love their décor and the colorful wall. The place is clean and comfortable. The sushi is always tasty and their service is fast and everyone is really nice. We'll continue to make this our sushi place whenever we're in the area for the improv.

This is a really good sushi place and we've been quite a few times now. Their miso soup is good and we always share several rolls. They have a large selection of rolls too, which is nice. Service can be a little spotty, sometimes being great and other times being forgotten but for the most part its not too bad. Overall this is a great place for some yummy sushi.

Delicious!! We're so excited that Freddy's is opening in Maricopa!! Finally a good burger place! We've been going to Freddy's since we lived in Chandler. Their burgers are thin steak burgers with all the toppings you could want. The shoe string fries are so yummy especially with their fry sauce. They have custard too! Honestly I've never tried it because I find it hard to pay for ice cream at any restaurant when I know I can get a half gallon at the store for almost the same price but I think once they open we'll finally try it. Can't wait!!!
