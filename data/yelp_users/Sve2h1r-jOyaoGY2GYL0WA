So I was taking a licensing class for my profession on Camelback and 16th Street....an area I have visited only a few times in the 25 years I've lived in Arizona (I am a blessed native Phoenician).  I kept trying to find a place to eat nearby that would be tasty, healthy, and where I could dine in an hour without eating horrid fast food. I happened upon Coup Des Tartes, and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was elated! The atmosphere is charming and quaint, sending me back to the time of villas and simple yet delicious food. My Chicken Pesto Sandwich was absolutely to die for - the pesto is every bit as good as my Sicilian grandma's - a review that was received with excitement by the incredibly cheerful and warm staff!  It was SO good in fact, that I went back the very next day and this time invited my foodie boyfriend - who had the sandwich I tried the day before - and was COMPLETELY wowed. My Brie and Ham sandwich was DELICIOUS.   This is now my FAVORITE lunch place - if only I worked closer to Coup Des Tarte - I would be their most frequent patron.

So I've only been here once, unless you count that time 20 years ago when i was there with my Girl Scout troop, and I really "dug" it. (Ok, I know puns are bad, but I'm feeling very punny today!)   But really, it's a real pleasure to have places in Phoenix flaunt what an amazing, rich and ancient history our valley really does have. After all the quips I hear about how hot it is during Summer, it's great to visit a museum filled with Arizona Awesomeness that I can flaunt to those Texans who swear their state is the best of them all. And this museum certainly does that.  Great pottery, docents and views make this museum a lovely place. I went for the Yelp Helps event, and was blown away by how absolutely gorgeous this place is at night, and how the sounds of the city just disappear and transport you back to a time when the light rail and street lights were figments of people's imaginations.   I can't wait to schedule this into the cool places I'll be taking my niece over Winter and Summer breaks!

Pizza has to be one of the most loved foods around the world. After all, it's a meal you can eat with one hand, fold, pull the cheese off, and add nearly any food to it and it's still delicious. You really can't go wrong with pizza. There are several different levels of pizza, and I'll share my categories with you in order from lowest to highest quality: 1. Cheap college student pizza -  2. Delivery brands - Papa John's, Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc. 3. Restaurant Pizza - NYPD, Oreganos, etc. 4. Specialty Pizza - Grimaldi's, Picazzo's, etc. 5. Gourmet - Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, etc.  Now that we have that out of the way, I'll rank The Garage. It's a combination of 1 and 3, and I love every bite of it. The flavors are solid, the crust is pretty good, it's a bit greasy (which has it's place in the pizza lover's arsenal), and the toppings are yummy.   I love stopping by the Garage anytime I'm coming home from hunting, hiking or shooting out in the Superstitions or Florence - stopping in when I'm out that way is a tradition! I adore The Garage. Plus, it speaks to my rural roots.

I live across the street, and work in the same complex. I eat here weekly, at least once.   Literally ALL their burgers are amazing. The Sweet Jalapeno is my favorite. You can get their KILLER onion rings, to die for french friends, or 1/2 and 1/2! Their Greenbay chili is really good. And their WINGS. The Honey Hot is my favorite. They have truly awesome Bleu Cheese Dressing (Even if you don't LIKE IT, Try it, You'll love it!).   I usually get the Honey Balsamic salad for lunch, with candied walnuts, fresh goat cheese, cranberries, and a dressing that is out of this world yummy!  The beer on tap selection is pretty small, but it's got some good ones. And they have damn good bloody mary's! The bartenders and servers are always peaches!

Living here for the last two years has been nice. The grounds and staff are wonderful. Rent is pretty reasonable for Scottsdale. The only drawback is the fairly consistent water repairs causing water to be shut off for the whole day.

After two car accidents in under a year, my neck and back were in pretty terrible shape. I've been to Spooner after each accident, and after the standard 8-12 weeks of treatment, I felt like my young spunky self again.   The first accident was a T-Bone on my passenger side, and my neck was all funky and hurting. Ryne massaged, manipulated and exercised my neck and shoulders back into pre-accident shape. He also equipped me with exercises to continue after treatment ceased, and they continued to help make my life better, especially since I'm at a desk all day long typing and designing away.  The second accident was much worse. I was at a complete stop when I was rear-ended at 35+ mph. My neck, shoulders, back, and arms were achy and had shooting pains. I had a constant headache until Torrey started treating me. Torrey is Ryne's older brother, and he's a miracle worker with my neck and shoulders. Now, after 8 weeks of treatment, I'm feeling much better, and should hopefully soon receive the "we don't wanna see you anymore" go ahead to resume my normal life.  These guys know their stuff - if you ever need PT, I'd recommend them. My mom (59 years old) went to Ryne after a leading surgeon botched her knee replacement. After a new replacement, she was in serious pain, and Ryne coaxed her leg back into shape and health with patience and understanding. She said she'll never go to anyone else.

With several Middle Eastern friends, I get a little picky because I get homemade food. Byblos was recommended to my boyfriend and me by a gentleman in Changing Hands who overheard me saying I missed our friend's hummus (they moved back to Israel), so we decided to check it out, and we were so happy we did!  The older gentleman who served us had a lovely accent and demeanor, and he was very helpful with choosing appetizers and entrees. The decore is a little sparse I suppose, but the food makes up for it. We had the hummus and shish-kabobs that were delicious. The hummus was as close as we've found to our Israeli friend's, so needless to say that would have been enough to captivate our senses.  We will definitely be going back!

I'm a beer lover/fanatic/snob. I started out drinking the gross light yellow stuff that Miller calls "Champagne", and as I grew older I also grew wiser. Much wiser, thankfully. Now, if I'm going to break my 50g Carbs/day or less rule on anything, it will be a delicious, usually craft, brew.   My honey and I went to Papago a few weeks ago to meet up with a couple for a few brews - and we were fairly pleased. Their 30 brews on tap definitely supplies something for everyone, and their local selection is pretty great. As for their beers, I've had the Orange Blossom and the Coconut Joe. The OB was fine for a lighter beer, but it was honestly a bit too sweet - not a fan. However, the Coconut Joe delighted me - it's coffee/coconut flavor is delightful, and it's a thick beer so it makes me happy.  The ambiance is nice and chill and the service is chill, too. Oh, and their selection of bottled brews - almost as amazing as Tops! Check this place out.

I love this place. I'm not sure if it's the solid selection of cigars, the patrons that you can chat with for hours, or the fact that Virgil is awesome, but it's my favorite place on Mill to hang out with friends.   There's nothing better than nice weather, a patio, awesome new & old friends, and a delicious cigar.   My only wish is that they carried pipe tobacco since I'm a pipe smoker.

THE BEST GUINNESS IN TOWN.  Their Mussels are delightful, as is the rest of their food. But really, I go here for the perfectly poured Guinness.

Over the last year, I've noticed a rapid decline in the quality of service at Rula Bula. It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.  On a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.  The waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True true to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was "left overnight".  Problem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.  There's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie.   I'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction.

Worst Happy Hour. EVER. In fact, my group of friends labeled it our "Friday UNHAPPY Hour".  1. The music is INSANELY loud, prohibiting a normal conversation even if the person is sitting right next to you.  2. The DJ is absolutely TERRIBLE. 3. While the free food concept is great......it was all kinda gross. 4. The server acted like she was doing us a favor. 5. The mix of people is really odd and kinda creepy. Old creeper men, weird ghetto younger men, and just a few of us business types. Really not the scene for a happy hour with business associates or 'sophisticated' friends.  The ONLY good thing I have to say is that they can't mess up tequila.

So a friend suggested we go to this awesome sandwich place for dinner - the only disclaimer he made was that it's cash only. This wasn't a problem for me, because places that only take cash are usually  less expensive - those credit machines aren't free to run!  The sandwich was good - I had Jambon, Provolone on baguette minus that lovely thing called pate. I'm NOT a fan of pate. It was delish. Tender ham, good cheese, neat atmospher. And they have Jones Soda's - which I always love.  I didn't get to try the DeLi Manjoo, so I'll have to go back! But those suckers look amazing!  Nothing remarkable - but it's a solid sandwich shop with incredibly reasonable prices!

10 PM on a Saturday night is rarely a good time to find delicious grub, but Carly's was definitely up to the task.   Drinks: try the Bloody Mary, it's the best I've had in town, and I KNOW my Bloody Mary's.   Food: I had the Cheese Dip Sampler which consisted of the Feta Rosa and the Artichoke dip. The pita seemed fresh, and tasted delicious. The Feta Rosa is super yummy, but only for those that have a love affair (like I do) with Feta cheese and Garlic. And the Artichoke Dip was delightful and definitely spicy, a nice take on an old favorite.  My complaint: the service was a bit sassy and slow. And it's a *teeny* bit hipster, so if that aggravates you, try to get past it, because the food is worth it. Especially if you drink a bloody mary ;)

Found this place by clicking on a Facebook link, and I've forsaken all bath and body type stores ever since. Bath bombs are awesome. Their shaving cream Shave the Planet (meant for men) is remarkable on my legs - goodbye foamy store stuff!  I am forever in love with their lip balm and scrub. In love with everything, really.   My boyfriend knows that if he wants to get a quick gift that'll please, Lush is the place to go!

Several months ago I had dandruff that WOULD NOT go away. I followed the recommendations of my hair dresser, dermatologist, massage therapist, manicurist, boyfriend, best friend and multiple internet sites. NOTHING worked - I tried every shampoo, oil, powder and lotion. Every method from cold rinses to deep conditioning to tea tree oil treatments. All to no avail. Needless to say, I was reaching the end of my rope and the height of embarrassment.  I've always been the girl among my friends with the best hair! It's long, thick, with just a hint of wave, and a perfect texture - but with dandruff, I lost that title.  THEN I stopped in my favorite store (WHY didn't I think of this FIRST?!), and discovered "Hair Doctor" mask. One treatment and I had dandruff-free hair for two weeks! Another treatment when it started coming back, and in two months I haven't had one speck of dandruff.  Have a problem? Go to Lush, they can solve any problem!

In my business I'm fortunate that insurance company people come out every quarter to wine and dine me, and I always get to pick the restaurant! I've been hearing fabulous things about Tarbell's for years, and have been making my way to dine there for awhile. Last night was THE night!  As I walked in the door, the hostess was smiling and the owner/chef Mark Tarbell was standing right there to welcome the guests - and since I'm a huge fan of Iron Chef America, I was incredibly excited to meet him.   The waiter was soft spoken and really pleasant, and the bread they bring to your table was delicious. Upon perusing the menu, there were several things that caught my eye - the Crispy Chickpeas, the Calamari and the House-Pulled Mozzarella. I'm a huge fan of the last two (and they were really good), but the first one had me a little skeptical. The Crispy Chickpeas were DELICIOUS! Crispy, a little cheesy, and just perfect.  The Tuscan Kale also had all of us a little skeptical, since kale is generally bitter. Not so with this delightful salad, I could eat it every day! For the main course we ordered the Mr. Fish of the Moment (halibut), Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna and the Cast Iron-Seared Pepper Steak - ALL of these were absolutely perfect in temperature and flavor!   Dessert is a must, especially here! We split several desserts -  Mascarpone Cheesecake  with Rosemary Caramel Sauce (TO DIE FOR) Profiteroles with Vanilla Bean Gelato & Chocolate Sauce (AMAZING) Southern Bread Pudding with Kentucky Bourbon Sauce The "Beloved" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate (MY FAVORITE)  I tried and loved them all!  Bottom line - this is now at the top of my favorites list. I would eat here every day if I could afford it!

I work in the same complex, just across the way. I frequent Jade Palace at least once a week, for a delicious and economical lunch. Their lunch combinations are really great! I usually get Kung Pao, which is served with Fried Rice, an Egg Roll, and a Crab Wonton. For $8.95, I couldn't ask for anything better.   My only complaint is that I don't get the soup with the lunch combo because I always eat take out!

SO Sad. This particular location has closed, due to lower traffic. The location on 92nd street and Shea is still open, as is their other one. They deliver for a few bucks, which is great since I can't always leave the office for lunch but I still want my JP!

Let me start by saying: I will drive from North Scottsdale to get Gelato here.  Yes, it really is THAT good! They have a Chocolate Brandy Cherry flavor that is the most divine thing I have ever had chance to eat! It's rich, but not so sweet that I couldn't easily finish my large in one sitting. If I were to live closer to this place, I would stop by almost daily. The Lemon flavor is luscious, a bit tangy with just enough sweetness. The Cherry is certainly for cherry lovers. Chunks of cherry make it scrumptious!

Their drinks, their food, and their service - all 5 stars.  I have only ever been for brunch, but each time has been delicious. Their brunch specials are always unique and delightful and the service has always been good.  The decor is quite a bit like Ticoz, which is nice, and it's really an atmosphere where any sort of attire is acceptable. Wear your jeans and cute tank, or your LBD and sky-high heels, you'll fit in either way.

So the boyfriend and I were an hour early for the Coytoes vs. Blackhaws yesterday, so we figured we'd get some food. We had planned on going to the BBQ place, which ended up having a 45-50 minute wait, as did Johnny Rockets, so we walked BACK to Which Wich.   I was delightfully surprised! The little bags you mark your sandwich fixings on are charming, and super efficient. The folks behind the counter were cheerful, and the sandwich was delish!!  Perhaps one of the BEST sandwiches I've ever eaten!

I have been going to Rolf's for YEARS, and my mother years before me! My mom, once upon a time, had Rolf as her hair stylist, before he focused on solely running the business.   The salon itself has a warm, enjoyable atmosphere. The reception desk gals and guys are really kind, and are so friendly on the phone! They offer you tea, coffee, lemonade, and other various goodies when you come in.  My stylist, Kristi, has to be one of the sweetest, and BEST stylists I've ever had the pleasure of working with. She really has great input on what styles suite your face shape best, tells you how to replicate the style at home, and helps you define your vision for your hair. She's cheerful and incredibly professional. I've been her client for over 5 years now, and if I moved to another part of the state, I would drive to Rolf's just to have Kristi do my hair!

My first tattoo was 3 years in the planning, and it was inked by Jet this afternoon. As tattoos go, mine wasn't terribly complex or large, but it held a lot of meaning to me, and I wanted it done right.   The design was a branch with Forget-Me-Nots and Lily of The Valley coming off, with a hummingbird hovering above the flowers. Jet took the Lily flowers (they're white - tough to make look good with ink), and shaded them with some grey, leaving some of my skin color in the flowers - they look amazing. He took my very loose idea and made it into a design I will forever be happy with.   The atmosphere is really relaxed, all the guys are hilarious, and during my time there we watched a ton of UFC fights - definitely makes you think twice before complaining about pain when you watch those guys get their faces bashed in!  Bottom line: Jet makes a first timer feel comfortable, and he was sympathetic when I needed a break because I was a bit light-headed. I really hope this guy never leaves Phoenix, I want him to do any remaining body art I get!

I love steak. It's my favorite food, my dying wish, my best friend and my version of PMS Ice Cream. I really, truly love steak. Some people (my mother) attribute it to my O+ Blood Type, others to my very outdoorsy/hunting family, and my vegetarian friends just think it's because I'm nuts. But no matter the reason, it's the best thing since The Big Bang. For this reason, I feel uniquely qualified to review a steakhouse, and even more so because I once worked at one of the best in the state.  As a college student who has a discriminating palate and a thin wallet, I take advantage of good deals when I find 'em - and The Keg has an AMAZING deal for you. For your birthday and/or anniversary, they send you an email redeemable for a free entrée of some type. Last year was Caesar Salad, Prime Rib,  and your choice of side. This year is an 8oz Sirloin with the same accoutrements.  So sign up for their birthday/anniversary club, you definitely won't regret it.  The steak I had last night for my birthday was really pretty good! I'm not much of a sirloin lover - I prefer Rib Eye because of the juicy flavors from more marbling, but this Red Meat Lover would never turn down a steak. The Top Sirloin was tender, moist, and had a really good flavor. AND they cooked it to my perfect Medium-Rare specifications. As my side, I chose the Twice Baked Potato; I wish they had brought me three more, they were so delicious! The Caesar Salad was pretty good, but the dressing wasn't anchovy-ey enough for me.   Overall, I wouldn't kick The Keg out of my bed, and I would probably invite it in. I only go here once a year because it's all I can afford at this point, but if I had the $$$, I would  definitely go back more frequently!!

I was out with the boyfriend for First Friday, and was desiring something cool, sweet, and creamy. My first thought is always Gelato. We were strolling, and came across Chill Out. When we walked in, it seemed clean, and the purveyors were quiet, yet smiling and friendly.   I ordered a large Lemon. The price wasn't terrible, but the flavor bordered on it. The consistency was like that of Gelato that had gone through a few thaw-freeze cycles, and was gummy. The texture was really gross because of this, and the flavor was pretty bland. I've had better Gelato out of the freezer aisle at my local grocery. I wouldn't drive out of my way, or even stop in when walking by, to eat this Gelato.

PROTEIN PANCAKES!  That's really all I need to say. I don't care if the service is bad, the tables are dirty or the coffee is watery. Their pancakes are worth an hour wait and a grumpy server.

KILLER workspace, definitely fits the name *nudge* haha, get it?! No? Ok I'll stop.   Moving on. The workspace/meeting space is contemporary, comfortable and welcoming. Especially for all you Macophiles in the world - they look like the Arizona division of Apple, Inc. (I think they have more Mac's than the Apple Store).   I was here for a Brew Camp about homebrewing, and the atmosphere was perfect for the learning, talking and tasting that took place. And the cooperative concept of Gangplank is really revolutionary. Makes me want to pack up my Scottsdale office and open shop in Gilbert!

It's a sweet little coffee shop on my way to work. They have a Sweet Honey Latte that is to die for. Starbucks used to make them, but they stopped several years ago. And what's more, Sonoma's is better, because their espresso is much better.  The drive-thru is super convenient, and the service both inside and out is speedy and friendly. The inside is a clean environment, without feeling sterile. They have sports &/or news on all the time.  They have excellent breakfast sandwiches they'll make for you in any combination you can think of.  And, they're only open until 2PM, and closed on weekends, just like a family-style coffee shop should be.   Check it out!!

So my beau's friend John introduced us to this place, as he lives right nearby. WOW. SO good!  I have only ever eaten the Gyros, but it's SO good. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, and the folks that work there are delightful. We often argue about how horrible the Red Wings are :) as they are from Detroit, and I'm a Coyotes fan. But it's all in good fun!  I would drive from Scottsdale to eat there!

What a charming little place. It took my honey and I back to our beach trips and how much fun chowing down next to water is! We started with some brews and the crab artichoke dip. Beer is always good, and they have a decent selection - they need more local stuff though. The dip was solid, as were the chips and other dipping bits.   For dinner I had the bowtie pasta - needed a little bit more salt, but otherwise it was delicious!  I didn't get the bread that I was supposed to though :( My honey had a burger, and said that it was pretty good.   Overall, it's a lovely place with solid food. The view and atmosphere is casual and lovely, and the service was friendly. We'll definitely be going back!

This is where to be on Monday or Tuesday nights after 8. The $20 Board & Bottle deal is unbeatable, and the vibe is cool and hip without being stuffy and overdone. It's a great place to take my young or yuppie clients for a nosh and drink, and they always have a wonderful time.  Their wine list seems to change quite frequently, and they always have a great selection. And they have a pretty good beer selection too, for those non-wine drinkers (I'm still questioning if those folks are human or not).   My favorite bruchetta is......umm.... all of them. I love going with 3 or 4 girlfriends, because we can get one of each kind, and bathe in the deliciousness.   Check it out, you won't regret it! Tip: Get there before 8 if you don't want to be waiting in line for half an hour!

Best place to go for a pint. The revolving beers make this place fresh and new with every visit. They feature delicious craft brew, none of that yellow piss stuff college kids call beer these days. The local features are always great since you don't have to hunt all over the valley to find them.   The folks behind the bar are great and laid back, offering up suggestions if you're ever stuck. The biggest bonus to this place is the fact that you can drink here anything you buy from next door, and they have a remarkable selection of already chilled bottles.  Also, if you're hungry they let you bring in food from Thai Basil or the pizza place just down the way. Awesome.

Favorite place to shop EVER! And there are many many reasons why, but I'll try to keep it short. I'll even number them for you, in order of importance. 1. Quite clean - Always a plus!  2. Friendly service - even the employees that don't speak English very well make every effort to help you find what you need, and they always say hello, and thank you. 3. Inexpensive - they aren't always "cheap", but their prices are often quite low, and very reasonable. 4. Unique - you can get ingredients here you can't get from supermarkets or AJ's. Need fresh lemongrass? They have it. Need galangal root (need to even know what it is?)? They have it. Need special spices for Thai or Indian dishes? They have them. 5. TEA-topia - they have a SERIOUS amount of teas available, ranging from whole-leaf to instant with sweetener. They're delicious, reasonably priced, and delightful. 6. Meat Department - their meat department has a really great selection of fish and shellfish. I don't particularly care for their chicken, but I try really hard to buy free-range chicken anyways. And their fish is fresh, and most often ocean rather than farm raised/caught. 7. Fun - this place is my playground. I have been in a few times, and every time I've just walked around exploring, reading and being like a kid in a candy shop. If you have a fondness for any kind of Asian food, from Japanese and Chinese to Indian or S.E. Asian, they have an aisle (or more) that will make you burst with excitement and wonder.  Bottom line - you really really must stop in. It's worth the trip, and you'll walk out with a tremendous amount of stuff you didn't know you could find or that even existed, and your bank account will smile at you.

I, along with two of my girlfriends, purchased the Groupon that was offered a month or two ago. It was definitely a great way to expose a new business!  My first visit went along rather nicely. I saved my groupon for a future use, and just got a Manicure with the gel overlay, since I had a pedicure that was still perfectly good. The previous reviews about the pedicure chairs are accurate, not too comfortable.  My second visit, was really disappointing. I went in the Saturday morning before Valentine's day, just checking to see if anyone was open so I could use my groupon. Because of a cancellation shortly after my arrival, I was slated for a pedicure first, and a manicure with a reapplication of the gel on my nails that I had received three weeks earlier. The receptionist (sweet girl) assured me that was possible, therefore launching my hopes of my nails looking fabulous for my date that night! When time came for the manicure, I was told that there wouldn't be enough time to do the service I was promised, but only regular paint. Well, ok, it's my fault for not scheduling an appointment. But when the girl was removing the gel with a buffer, she buffed so hard and fast, that my nail beds burned, and I had severely damaged nails when I left. Worse than if I had acrylics removed by peeling them off.  I commented about how it burned, and she looked at me as if I was being a pansy, and said "it always feels like that. if you don't like it, then don't get the gel polish". Are you KIDDING ME?! The reason it hurt, was because she didn't give a flying flip about me, and wanted to move on to her next client. She was upset that I wanted the gel to be redone to begin with.  The group of nail techs all are really really chatty and loud, and a little obscene. The music was SO loud I could hardly hear the questions being asked of me.   I will never go back here.   The only bonus, was I was offered a complimentary glass of wine on my first visit.

Not the WORST place, but nowhere NEAR the best place, I've ever been.  Went in, back in January, for a dinner around 9:30, on a rainy night with my beau. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to stop, acknowledge our existence, and take our drink order. By that time, we had decided our food order, and gave her that, too. Another 10 minutes later, we received our beverages. another 25 minutes later, we received our order, and my chili cheese fries were decidedly bland, while his hamburger was worse than McDonalds. Minus that his regular fries were actually good.  I'm pretty sure that will be my only experience at SPS's. The decorations were pretty awesome though.

The staff has always been fairly friendly. I admit that includes an allowance for the standard gamer-geek awkwardness and lack of social poise. I'm a gamer, and have been for years, but I somehow managed to escape the standard of not showering and not speaking.   The new games are new, so not much to say there. The used games are often pretty good, and when they aren't, they're easy to return and receive a replacement or refund for. For example: I bought a Harry Potter game, and the first two used copies wouldn't work in my PS3, so they gave me a new copy. They even went so far as to hunt down another copy, play with it and then transfer it to my nearest store.   The customer service is difficult to beat. And they have great prices on games.

Last night my honey and I went through our usual "what do you want for dinner?" routine, where both of us try to avoid choosing. He said "Greek sounds great", and I thought so too. So, I pulled out my trusty Yelp Android app, and we picked Posidon because of all the amazing reviews.  We were so excited to try a new place close to home, and it smelled quite good when we walked in. The waitress informed us it was her birthday, and that service might be a bit "slow". No worries there, that was ok with us after a long day.   We ordered spanakopita as an appetizer, he ordered a gyro with no tomatoes and french fries, and I ordered the beef souvlaki sandwitch with Greek salad.   Let me preface the food review with this: I LOVE food. I love going out to eat. I'm very forgiving of mistakes, and kind when I correct them. Out of my 56 Yelp reviews, only 4 have received 1 star, and all for a very legitimate reason. I really go out of my way to give places ample opportunities to correct my frustrations, and few places are lacking in their ability to make me happy. That said, on to the food.   Spanakopita: It took awhile to come out, and it was not terribly appetizing to look at. The two pieces were drastically different in size, but that wasn't the worst part. The spanakopita was luke warm/cold, tasted like it came from the frozen food aisle or had been sitting out for weeks. It was bland, not at all flaky, and the texture was really weird. Oh, and the tzatziki sauce was the worst I've ever tasted, including the months past due grocery store kind that I kept in my fridge as a poor college student. The waitress didn't bother to come back and ask how it was.  Gyro with fries: The meat was flavorless, cold, and smothered in tomatoes (he specifically said to leave them out) and that terrible tzatziki sauce. The fries were cold and awful. HOW do you mess up fries???  Beef souvlaki with salad: The beef was tougher than shoe leather, and the leather would have had more flavor. The tzatziki (yes, I'm saying it AGAIN just to emphasize) was TERRIBLE. Oh, and the salad. If you could even call it that. It came in a bowl with a fat blob of yucky dressing, close-to-gone onions & tomatoes, with 2 olives, no feta, and lettuce that looks like it had been trampled on by a herd of zebras.  We tasted each other's dinner to double check, talked quietly, and confirmed that it was the worst dinner (I told the waitress this in an apologetic tone) we'd ever had. The plates were thrown together like they didn't care, and the service was sub par.  The WORST Part: The waitress saw us not eating, came over and asked how dinner was. I politely said it was terrible, and started listing off our grievances. Then a woman, who was apparently the "boss lady" came over to see what was wrong. I've never been so insulted in my life. When my bf said that the gyro meat was cold and bland, she said "well they cut it off the rotisserie and put it on the grill". He politely told her that he knew that's how it worked, but that it wasn't hot. She said "Well, that doesn't make any sense. We're known for the best gyros in town, and we have 4 & 5 star reviews on Yelp". Ok so we're totally making all this up, then. *scoff* She said "sorry" and walked away. No offer to replace the food, or take a portion off our bill.   So we paid $22 for food we said was terrible, with nothing but a condescending apology to walk out of the door with. FYI, we paid for our food (we regret refusing to do so), and left all but 2 bites of each dinner on the table.   I'd give the place another chance if the food were the only bad thing. But with that terrible service, I wouldn't step foot in there again if my life depended on it.

Best comic shop EVER. The owner is passionate about his place and his love of all things comics is evident. He greeted my comic-nerd honey and I with enthusiasm, and frequently asked questions to both see if we needed help, and to also offer suggestions.   The coffee bar is sweet, with killer names for drinks.  They have an awesome selection of old comics (my total fetish), and are willing to keep an eye out for things you've been searching for. Their game nights sound awesome, and I can see it being an awesome place to get some homework done, or just chill after a long day.   So say we all.

Monday of my 4-day Memorial Day weekend, I get a craving for some hookah smoking and relaxing. It's 9pm, and I look for places still open, and thankfully Zayn's was.   My first impression was that the place was fairly clean, but the girls were frazzled, running all over the place. Later we found out that they had run out of fruit and bottled water so one of the girls had to make a run to the grocery store.   The hookah itself was pretty great. I chose Mango shisha and was pleased. Apparently, they use fruit bowls instead of regular bowls, so the mango had a grapefruity note - not bad, but certainly not my favorite. I would have liked to know before hand, so I could opt out of the fruit.  My biggest frustration was that they didn't have an Turkish Coffee. I suppose that wouldn't normally bother me too much (though this was the first time I smoked shisha without a cup of Turkish in my hands), but the fact that they had run out of so many other things too made me feel like this place was really ill-prepared for business.   Without their Yelp! offer, my session would have been $17+, apparently because of the fruit bowl that I didn't know I was getting. Not sure I'll try this place again unless I'm jonesing and they're the only place open nearby.

I've been going to Amber for close to a year now, and my skin is the happiest and healthiest it's ever been. She uses lovely natural ingredients, always knows exactly what she's slathering on your face, and is willing to chat about any skin issues or problems you see along the way. I'm getting ready for my wedding (in 39 days!), and I know that without a doubt my skin will look amazing because of Amber. Not only does she know her stuff, but she's gentle and kind, and never tries to shove products in your hand. Amber is delightful, and so talented. Plus, who can argue with a relaxing atmosphere, and hand/foot massages with every facial? No one!

I've been working in the Village at Hayden complex for over 4 years now, and my family has owned a business in the complex for over 15, so I've eaten at all the restaurants that have been in (and out) of the complex over the last decade and a half at least once, if not more.   It's owned by The Collins Family, proprietors of Wally's American Pub. The concept is really exciting to me. It's all about American favorites made with mostly local and always fresh ingredients of the highest quality. The decor is soothing, with excellent jazz-styled music for listening pleasure. The booths are large and comfortable, and the entrance for the patio is through garage-style doors. Unique, inviting, and pleasing to the eye. The other detail I noticed and loved was the weight of the flatwear. Maybe it's just me, but I really prefer eating a good meal with heavy and comfortable utensils.   The cuisine is what you're really concerned with, so I'll get to that now (finally!).  The only appetizer I've tried so far (because it's so amazing I can't stop ordering it!) is Dad's Grocery Bag. It comes with 3 cheeses (Manchego, Fresh Goat's Milk and Paremesean), 3 meats (Soppressata, Prosciutto and Capocollo), French loaf, olives, nuts and honey comb plated on a wooden cutting board, with the honey comb resting on a long-handled spoon. Now, if only my dad's grocery bag really carried all these delights when I was a little girl!  I'm a salad girl, largely because of my grain allergy (I save my grain consumption for delights like the bread and a craft brew), and they knocked the Seasonal Vegetable Chop out of the park. Tomatoes, beets, grapes, squash, corn, tomatoes, cabbage, manchego cheese and butter beans tossed in a parsley creamy champagne vinaigrette. Excellently executed, and something I would eat every day for the rest of my many-remaining days if I could afford to do so.   I've heard from a reliable source (my father, who is something of a fish nut) that the Blackened Red Fish was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, as was the dirty orzo. And the Grilled Angus Burger is a serious meat-eaters delight, with excellent ground chuck and fresh veggies with Tillamook Cheddar.   Oh. And their hot tea! It's LOOSE LEAF brought to you in a nice little teapot. If only every dining establishment would recognize that loose leaf is so vastly superior to the bagged teas. Maybe they'll catch on soon.  For a restaurant that has been open less than a month, I have to say that they've completely hit it out of the park. My new fav lunch spot, in a complex where the Spotted Donkey, Zipps, and Tandoori Times vie for that spot. The Collins Family has another hit.

Shangri La. My Happy Place. Heaven on Earth. Twirl is the best frozen yogurt shop I've ever eaten at. And I consider myself somewhat of an authority on the subject, because it is my favorite dessert in the entire world. Their flavors are delicious, the yogurt is creamy, and the topping options are wonderful. They have the BEST fresh blueberries I've ever had at any yogurt shop, and I love that they have mochi!  And the price is really reasonable. SO much so, that my honey and I went twice in just a few days, and we don't really live right in the area. I know we'll be back really, really soon.

I really hate to do this downgrade, but I have to for the sake of all those that love good beer and some sort of decent service.  After my fourth visit, I'll likely refrain from stopping in to  WOB for quite some time. 15 minutes at a table, and 10 at the bar, and still no one would talk to us to take our orders and money. Even after trying to flag folks down at the bar and table, my friends and I were totally ignored. Sure, they have a phenomenal selection of beer, but that doesn't do me a bit of good if no one will take my order. The employees were too busy yucking it up with each other to pay us any mind at all.  Hopefully they'll educate their employees here pretty soon. I would love to spend money here, but they have to want to take it, first.

Mat and Sharry Engelhorn have a big hit on their hands. Angel's Trumpet Ale House, so named because of the meaning of their last name and their passion for all things craft beer, is my new favorite place.  Service: Generally speaking, opening nights are fraught with disaster, poor service, and mediocre food. Not so with AT, everything was as amazing as I would expect it to be when the place wasn't jam packed with people. Our server was pleasant, pretty speedy, and explained a few details to us. She was in a hurry, but she didn't hurry us, and that's a really good thing.  5 stars for service.  Food: The FOOD! Oh yes the food was incredible.   I can think of no greater sin than soggy wings, but these wings were crispy and tender, with an incredible spicy buffalo sauce, and a delicious bleu cheese dressing. Instead of throwing a few carrot and celery stalks on the plate, they were made into a salad with a few radishes for spice and color. Let me say again, the wings are AMAZING.    My honey ordered the pizza with peppered bacon, sausage, pepperoni, and leeks - it was crispy, just enough cheese and sauce without being overwhelming, and the ingredients were amazingly high quality. I ordered the Southwest burger, and it was incredible. I love that you get to choose your protein - I chose beef, and the beef patty was moist and perfectly cooked/seasoned. My only "complaint" is that I wanted MORE Adobo sauce for a bigger kick, and maybe a bit more cheese, but those are easy modifications to make next time around. The burger bun was light and delicious, with perfect flavor to compliment the patty and toppings.   They also have featured seasonal dishes on the chalk wall as you walk in, and they sound absolutely incredible.  Dessert was fantastic and a fun play on childhood treats. We ordered the seasonal pop tart which was strawberry rhubarb, and it was delicious. The filling wasn't sickening sweet like a normal pop tart, and it was spread between layers of what looked to be a modified puff pastry or phyllo dough. The top was drizzled with a fantastic thin frosting, and finished with sprinkles of pink sugar for a playful and crunchy touch.  5 stars for food!  Beer: Their beer selection on tap is magnificent. So many beers I know and love, and many that I had never tried/heard of before. I tried two new IPA's and they were both splendid. The pour was great both times - one in a pint and one in a tulip, the head was perfectly poured with just the right amount and appropriately sized bubbles. Their beer folks know their stuff. 5 stars for beer!  Atmosphere: I loved walking up and into ATAH. The slump block building reminds me of my childhood home, and their metal grate dividers outside are genius and rustic. The inside perfectly blends the beauty of the wood rafters and block walls with bright colors, natural wood chairs and tables, concrete bar top, and tile backsplash. And you can't miss the massive amount of windows to let in the sun and the gorgeous sunset views. It was a true pleasure to take part in the best time of Arizona summers at this amazing pub. Oh, and I love that they have three unisex bathrooms, it is a nice relief from the standard multiple stall setup that precludes you from privacy in your most private moments.  5 stars for atmosphere  So that's 5 stars all around, and I only expect it to get better with age. I'm going back tonight, and maybe tomorrow, and definitely Sunday. I'll be here a lot., you should definitely try it.

I've been on a quest over the last several years, to find a place for pedis/manis/artificial nails that I actually LOVE going to, where I could have artificial nails done that DON'T lift! My search is over.  In December, I went in for a pedicure. The seats are these great, long cushioned benches, with each place set with a back message should you wish to turn it on. The pedicure tubs are really lovely, and they use removable tubs for each one. They are filled with warm water that's infused with lemon or orange peels. They have a vast selection of lotions for your mani/pedi, including all your favorite spa scents. I had a gal named Uueyn (Pronounced Wynn), and I've been going to her ever since!  Lesley's review about the ambiance is spot on. I love that I am able to have a reprieve from the Top 40 for an hour, and listen to calming classical on a softer volume. The owner and her husband are there a lot, as she does nails too. Both really kind and helpful people.  My mother and I both get gel nails, I get tips, and my mom gets the overlay. She's been having them done by Uueyn for a year, and she's NEVER had a chip, lift, crack, or break, and she's definitely not kind to her hands. I have the same experience, but with a shorter track record.   I would recommend making appointments, as walk-in can be hit or miss. The prices aren't any higher than other salons in the area for equivalent quality, and seem to actually be lower.   I have recommended Uueyn and Scottsdale Hand Foot Spa to my friends, and all that have tried it, absolutely love it!
