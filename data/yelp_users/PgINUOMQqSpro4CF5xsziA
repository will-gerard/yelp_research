Always a good place to come. I love happy hour as all appetizers are half off! Makes for a decent break on the wallet. Usually pretty pack especially on weekends. Come early!

Always a good place. Customer service is top notch and they always check up on you even if you are sitting outside. It's a step up from Denny's to be sure. Around the same price too! This is the only 24 hr location that I know of.

Amazing sandwiches and probably the best servers/staff of any restaurant I've been to. Great choices and gourmet sandwiches available that comes with a handful of sides and a pickle. Condiments on every table and a tray of free water at the end of the counter. All smiles around. Such a great place. I can complain about the price but I just keep coming back anyway! It's that good!

Kind of small place, I feel like. But this was the first and still the best Chili's  I've been to in town. The service was great. The waiter knew what was going on and knew his stuff, suggested a great margarita for a price I deem worth it. The EL PRESIDENTE or something like that. Food is good and had more than one person wait on us which was pretty cool considering we weren't the only ones there. Our drinks always filled. That's the main thing I look for. Not too shabby.

Food was good. Service started out good but then became less and less... good. He was there to help us fill drinks, took our orders, refilled our endless shrimp, etc but when we gave him the money for the check, he pretty much disappeared with it. We sat there for probably 20 minutes and never saw him walk by again. Had to ask another waiter where he was with our change and when he came back, he said "I thought you didn't want change". Really. No way we were tipping you $50, bro.

The cook this day was not cooking... Our order was not too out of whack but it sounded like there were a lot of screw ups all around us. We heard the manager tell one of the servers that she had enough of the cook today so she was basically going around calming customers back their eats. So I admire that about her. Poor people, though. I mean, I asked for my steak well done but came out medium... I still ate it cause I still enjoy medium steak, but it's just not what I wanted at that time. Not sure if we will revisit this location in the future.

It was our first time here and everything was going smooth. We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait.   When we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.  He came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked "So what did you guys want to drink, again?" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying.   Our order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically "who had this or that" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones.   After a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.  After he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.  When it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.  So we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to.   As for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries. I gave one-star for the food and one-star for the service.   I guess I was expecting a lot more from the reviews and reputation Lo Lo's had...

Moved in March 1. I love this complex. The staff is awesome. The maintenance is awesome. The grounds are kept and they do whatever they can for you as long as you make your issues known. Never had an issue here and they don't hesitate to just kind of hang out with you. For this being our first place together, we really think we picked a great place and community to live in. Every one seems to get along just fine. I don't know what the future holds but we can see ourselves living here for quite some time.

Came here for the first time last night a few hours before they closed. I must say that there were many interesting things for sale. I don't know what I was expecting an "antique mall" to be but it really wasn't what I expected. It's basically full of glass cases , open cases, and many floor items that vendors stock I'm hopes of selling. It's a great idea and I found many things I wouldn't  mind buying. Some things I wouldn't consider "antique" though. It seems to be a little under staffed cause I didn't really come in contact with many.

Always a great place and I think they gotten better with the move. It's much more fancier now and the staff seems very happy to be serving you. They are understanding and very patient, too. Our waiter was very funny and was positive. I can't exactly recall his name since it's been a few days but he looks exactly like Kevin Smith. We asked if he's ever gotten that and he says yes, a few times. Also helped us settled our Star Wars over Star Trek dispute and also added Marvel over DC. Yes, we are a bunch of nerds but we will continue coming back!

A horrid first time. You get judged the moment you walk through. I ordered a number 8 which was a crispy but I was given a 7 which was a grilled. I had them fix it and they apologized with an apple pie. Then I heard someone say to not give it away. So that's cool.

Been trying to find a replacement Denny's since we've moved that was always our go-to place. It was pretty much perfect, however, this one is not it. Seems like the waiter forgets you're there... or doesn't bring everything you order... only been here once and probably won't be back.

I went in for a quote and the guy was really helpful. Explained to me a few different ideas for what I wanted and this was just me explaining to him what I wanted. I didn't have a picture really but he was able to figure out what I wanted pretty quickly. It looked very clean at first glance and seemed widely known. Kind of a small shop but size doesn't mean quality. I may have to go back with a clearer idea of what I actually want.

Big and filled with clothing and people. It was very busy on this day but I'm not sure how it is most days for I have only been here once before way back. Every employee I can count asked how we were and if we needed help as they passed by. Some even came over to us. So customer service was pretty good. Got lots of clothes to go through both guys and girls as opposed to the other location where it was mostly girls clothing. It seemed pretty clean to me too.

Found this place a few months ago through a friend. Nice, little coffee shop with a full bar as well. Coffee is VERY good. Also open later than places like Starbucks. Weekdays till 12 and weekends till 2, I believe. Prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is cozy. Lots of college students on their laptops. Lots of hipsters. Everyone generally nice and you can overhear some crazy conversations. Smoking permitted outside. Has a full bar, in-house snacks and meals. Also has a full bar. All types of people come through.  It gets busy most nights (or at least nights I've been there) and the only bad thing about it is that there isn't enough seating!

Amazing. All I have to say is that the service was incredible. Our waiter Brandon ( I really hope that was what his name was) was knowledgeable and gave us a great rundown of their menu and sauces. He even drew us a little piggy in the sauces to explain each one! It was really a unique experiences. The food was better than he explained! We will definitely be back for round two!  THE DEVIL SPIT BURGER IS DELICIOUS.

Love Dr Tiffany, love Dr Gettleman. They are both very patient and answers our questions very well even when they seem like paranoid concerns. Dr Gettleman is very animated and colorful and I think that goes very well with the kids to be comfortable. Dr Tiffany is very kind and nurturing. The rest of the staff is very nice and always willing to assist.

They don't really seem to care. Prices are okay but not as low as they make them out to be. Employees just look at you like they are annoyed at you coming in or are judging you. This is mostly the younger employees though. I only come once in awhile but the atmosphere never changes. Also disorganized.

Been to this one twice. And the service was poorer than the last. Took our order and forgot about us. I think the waiter realized that he indeed forgot about us and came up and said there was a delay with our food. Why would that be when the people who came after us already had their's. Weird. He ended our night by checking on us maybe once. We were there for probably an hour... Fun.

Crap place. We came here after a weekend trip for our son's 2nd birthday. He enjoyed all the games and had fun. I mean, he's 2, he won't noticed how we were being served, of course. I ordered food for my family, 1 pizza, some wings, some cheesy bread, fries and hot wings. Food took almost an hour to come out. Wings were not hot, they were bbq. Cheesy bread was really greasy for some reason. Fries were obviously from a frozen bag, undercooked, and was not completely drained of oil. Pizza was actually good. Probably 4 girls worked that night. The greeter, who was completely uninterested in her job. Did she even welcome us? She pretty much stood at the entrance the entire night when the other girls needed help. Girl running cashier and orders was pleasant. She tried hard to make our stay okay but she can only do so much, I guess. Third girl looked like she was running prize booth, running tables, running Chuck E costume but again, uninterested in her job. 4 person was probably the cook? I didn't see her much. Everything was pretty much chaos when it came to the service. Maybe I shouldn't complain cause this place is not for adults and kids don't know anything about service yet... but damn...

Best wings I've ever had are here. They have loads of choices in flavor as well as strips and sandwiches. Reasonably priced too. Been to this Wingstop many times with no issues whatsoever. Usually get the 30 wings, fries, and veggies. I think it's $24.99. Give or take. Love this place.

This is a great Target. Lots of nice employees and always greet you with a  smile. Even the Starbucks people do so. VERY clean inside and out! Would recommend instead of the Wal-Mart on the other side of the plaza.  The only bad is it's right next to the light rail station. Lots of creepers and people who think they are badass walk around.

The place atmosphere was great. Really loved the way you can make your own sandwich and just pretty have it any way you want it. The worker that was helping us was really informative and walked us step by step on how to create a sandwich. It was pretty good! I got the bbq chicken and coleslaw with pretty much all the fixings. It wasn't "the best sandwich in the world" but it was a good eat.

Very disappointed. Came here around 9pm (they close at 11pm) on a Monday night. We were greeted and seated promptly. The waitress taking our order seemed like her mind was elsewhere for pretty much the whole night. (Strike 1) I ordered the Houston WITH onion rings on top at an extra $1.39. No problem. I got my burger and there was JUST ONE onion ring on it. And a small one at that. (Strike 2). My fiance had a Dr Pepper and when a refill came along, they gave her a Coke instead. She hates Coke. (Strike 3).   I could understand the mistakes (cause they were small) if it was busy that night but aside from us, there was two other tables. AND another waitress in the house. It was a very disappointing experience.

It was great. Being our first time, the server was very courteous and did a good job answering our questions about the food.

The cashier was a little meh. But she was friendly enough in taking our order. Maybe I expect to much when I go into a place and tell them it's our first time? She was just kind of saying like "okay, cool, here's the menu"... that's good and all but dude, it's my first time, say things like " oh sweet! welcome! I hope your visit is amazing!" be excited for me! Well, rant over. But the food was great. We had some good eats here.

It's a Wal-Mart, what do you really expect? Got some good times and bad times in here. The really good thing is that it's connected to Christown Spectrum so you can go there when you get treated poorly here. Not all employees suck though, like all places. They are kind of slow, though.

So I ordered online last night because dinner plans fell through. I've never ordered at this location before so I figured I'd give it a shot. We are in between 2 Papa John's: this one and the one on 43rd and Bell, and spoiler alert, the one on 43rd and Bell is way better.  I finished placing my order at 8.02PM. The email said it'd be 30-40 mins, which is normal so whatever. 8:50ish rolls around...hey, where's my pizza? I called the store, forget the name of the dude, but I asked where my pizza was. He took and look and said and I quote "he should be coming up right now". Sweet. I can forgive 10 mins. So I wait. And then wait. Where's the dude? I don't bother to call cause I can almost guarantee they'd say the driver is coming... so now I'm going to see how late they are.  9.05pm...still nothing.  9.10pm...still nothing.  Around 9:20ish, knock on the door! HOORAY! So I answer and the dude didn't say a thing. He had an expressionless look on his face like he knew he'd done bad. I'm like whatever, I was just happy to have my food, cause yeah, my son and I were hungry. I say thanks and he leaves...looking like a lost puppy.  So we sit and start chowing down... hey guess what? Pizza's cooled. Not even the good cool. It was pretty much tasting like it was left out. Oh you want a kicker? Effin' ham was crunchy... no, not the good, slightly burnt crunchy, it was kind of like undercooked crunchy... like it was still partly frozen crunchy... that was nasty stuff.  After we finish I start thinking, no way in hell it takes that long to make pizza and get to my place. Especially on a damn Tuesday night with no events going on. I check the bill and it says they didn't leave the store until 9.02pm... like really? Did you not think I'd check the receipt? Your receipted ratted your ass out that after my pizza was made, it was left on the counter and you didn't make your damn delivery until 9.02 pm. Exactly 1 hour after I had ordered. But wait, didn't you say the driver was about to roll up when I called you at 8.50pm?  This is a crap location and should be ashamed to bear the name 'Papa Johns'. No other Papa John's ever had been this late and made pizza this crap. And has never lied about the driver being on his way. Just wow. Get outta here.

Good food. Not enough seating and often gets busy. If you're white, they treat you with royalty. It's not a race thing, it's an Asian thing. The fancier you dress, the more they pay attention to you. Don't expect water to be constantly filled, you have to ask them. They aren't on top of it but that's how Asian places are. The Pho is great. Just about everything on the menu is good. Try it out. Go early.

Definitely a great eat here. I only tried Culver's a few months ago for the first time. It's a little bit pricey-er than other burger joints, but this place is worth it. My first experience was at the Paradise Valley location. It was a smaller store. This one is so much bigger and offers more seating. The hospitality and service are exceptional. Everyone smiles and is quite nice. The burgers are a delight! Also serves chicken and roast beef sandwiches. I would compare them to Lenny's Burgers but a little bit more fancy and classy when it comes to presentation. Will definitely be back.

LOVE the local joints. Actually found this place on Yelp and was glad that we did. Ordered the pastrami burger and let me tell you, there is absolutely no comparing that masterpiece with anything else. The burger was completely delicious. It literally punched me in the mouth with flavor. We also got their philly and wow. Every ingredient was proportionate and made every bite damn near heaven. This place knows what a good meal is and the portions are completely adequate. Fries are completely legit. I can't believe I never knew of this place back in my high school days. Would have been a regular for sure.

Whoa, the two times I've actually been to this location has been very far a part. Although I don't remember my first time here too well, I just know there wasn't any problems. The more recent visit was great. My server, David, was an awesome dude, kind of just hanging out with us and taking care of our every need. He made it like a chill out, rather than us just being in a restaurant so that was pretty cool of him.

Extremely amazing. I can give this place a definite 5-stars. Their burgers are mouth watering tasty and you will crave it soon after you have your first meal. We found this place from Yelp reviews and I am glad I did. I ate here because I was starving so of course it was good but then I went back the next day when I was just hungry and the quality had not changed. Great, laid back staff who converse with you and make sure you are happy. Please, if you are in the area, check it out because this is by far one of the best burgers I have ever experienced.

Will always come back. They are amazing. Chicken is always on point. Not a five stars because I'm picky and when I say no lettuce on the sandwich, I expect no lettuce, but once in awhile they still put the lettuce. Other than that, pretty solid.

I didn't really enjoy it, actually. It was my first time and they were basically giving me that look like why did I even show up if I didn't know what I was doing. Um, isn't that why you go to new restaurants? He did explain to me what they had and things of that nature but it just was very uncomfortable. The sandwich wasn't as I expected.

Place is pretty good after new ownership took affect. Pretty clean and organized. I would give the food 4/5 stars. Better than most chinese buffet places. Looks like all employees are actually Chinese. Your drink is always filled since they check up on it regularly. I actually had more than I could drink they filled it so often. Prices are good at $6.99 per person during lunch. Dinner is $9.99 per person. Children 3-5 is $2.99 as the check said. Soda is $1.49. And guess what, REAL ICE CREAM. We were pretty happy about that. Worth it.

Amazing, low prices on many different grocery items. Everything is pretty easy to find and some of their sales are really top notch. Only thing keeping it from a full five stars would be service. Employees seem to just kind of watch you look for stuff. The coolest dudes are the deli guys but some of them actually come off as douchebags. There's one guy that's pretty funny though.

Great price! Every sandwich is 5$ plus whatever else you want. It's a small menu so not much need to stumble through a list of choices. The pizza sandwich is amazing. They have their own mix of hot peppers too which is delicious! The service is good and friendly.

I don't really do car washes but this place is pretty cool. I was surprised they actually greeted up and talked to you. Only thing really keeping this from being 5 was that the 3 dollar wash didn't really clean well. Maybe I shouldn't be complaining since it was so cheap.

This place is like packed 24/7... maybe because the only time I've ever gone was in the morning...so don't quote me on that 24/7 thing. But this location is really awesome. The dudes who work there are personable and love how they can just talk to you about anything. Love the Dutch Bros experience. No other coffee place can compare.

Ever since moving to the North side of town, we were looking forward to trying out this place and making it "our spot". We were very weary about it because we loved our original spot, Pho Thanh on 17th ave and Camelback. But this place blew us away. It's a little family owned joint and they are absolutely the nicest people. It may be another dollar are two, but I feel like the experience is worth it. It sounds weird but the pho tastes "cleaner" and "fresher". It's like to cook it fresh every few hours or something to keep it tasting great! Service is also quick and top notch.

The best bang for your buck pizza out there, I would say. Basically a Subway BUT PIZZA. You choose what you want on it and virtually no limits. Pretty good size and they make it right there. Great place to eat.

The service was outstanding. The waiter was knowledgeable and cared that it was our first time there. Asked him about a few dishes and he went into DETAIL about them. Had a good time.

Extremely nice, amazing, courtesy service. The ramen and the sushi were delicious. Try the shrimp popcorn roll if you like some crunch! Will be back for sure.

AMAZING. I think that's the only word I can think of. This is so cool that FINALLY we have some kind of "oddities" type shop in Phoenix. I've been searching for one for a long time, and yes I was guilty of being into it after watching the show "Oddities". Mason, the shop owner (if not one of them, I'm unsure of that), is SO nice and friendly and I just want to keep throwing money at him. His stocks are pretty good for a new shop and they just keep updating. There's always something new to look at.   If you haven't already, please check this place out! It's on 6th ST and Roosevelt, a few doors down from the Jimmy Johns. They are good people and it's always great to support local shops.

This is the worst McDonald's experience I've ever had. Let me explain:  We had just gotten back in town from a trip and was starving and just happened upon this Micky D's. We ordered number 8, a crispy chicken delux, and a number 3, a 1/4 lb'er but plain with cheese and then a kid's meal for our son. Our order came out in no time, which is what you'd expect from fast food.  My girlfriend ordered the number 3 but when we got it, it had pickles and onions on it. No big deal cause we could just take it off. Problem solved.   I ordered the crispy chicken and what I got was a grilled chicken so I took it back and let him know I got the wrong order and the cashier said sorry and they were going to remake it. I was cool with that. Actually sat there for awhile, conversing and realized much time has gone by and we were actually finished with our fries with no sandwich. I went to the counter and there was no one there. It seems like they were understaffed? But I waited for a few minutes before the original cashier came back and I told him that I hadn't gotten the sandwich yet. He was apologetic and handed it to me. I guess it was prepared but no one said anything.  I went back to my table, ready to eat but wait, it's ANOTHER grilled chicken sandwich. Really? And the kicker? It was in a crispy chicken box... does the cook think I wouldn't notice what a crispy chicken is supposed to look like? Again, I took it back and the cashier, real nice dude, I had no blame on him whatsoever, he called back to the cook(s?) with me watching asking them what they were doing and to make the order correct. He again was apologetic and assured me it would be right out.   Again, I sat down and waited for awhile. I went back to check again and the manager who knew what was going on the whole time was the first to notice me coming back up, asked her crew where my sandwich was... and guess what, it wasn't even made this time. The cashier, again, asked the cook why there was no sandwich then he said he said he was going to go make it so I would get my long-awaited for sandwich. He did as he said. I watched him go into the kitchen, put on gloves, and personally made my chicken sandwich.  At this point, however, I was over it. I told the manager to forget the sandwich cause my family was tired and we were ready to go home. I don't usually do this, but I asked for a refund, which she happily obliged to. She was also very apologetic and was able to refund me as well as give me my sandwich and a coupon. If it wasn't for that, this review was never going to be more than 1-star.   I don't know if the cooks were just not wanting to work tonight for whatever reason and I really don't know who was to blame, but I do know the original cashier (I wish I remembered his name) and the manager were willing to do what they could to help me. I would like to thank you two for that...  But I will not be coming back to this location.

Damn, that was fun. Ordering drinks and food can be a bit of a hassle and needs work but the server was freakin' cool/chill. I guess with a group as big as we had, on a very busy night, things can get hectic, but every thing came out great. Thanks!

It definitely was a first time I would have liked to have back. Told the servers that it was my first time there and they really didn't even acknowledge it. I asked what really was popular and it seems that they just pointed to the most expensive thing on the menu.   The meat wasn't even all too great. It was dry and there really wasn't a taste to it. We had the brisket, turkey and ham. The portions was definitely ridiculous as well. It did not even fill me up.  I wouldn't go back.

This place has never let me down as far as the quality of food goes. Only reason this doesn't get a 5 star rating is because some of the employees are... let's say... distractable. If I didn't say "hey that's my burrito you're about to give that guy" or "hey, I ordered chips", I probably would've been hungry with no money that day. The rest of the time though, every one's chill.

Meh, just your standard Walmart. Nothing really stands out about this one. Walked by an isle with an employee just standing around. He asked if we were good but he was blatantly just making it look like he was doing something. It was quite entertaining.

Greg is amazing here. He showed me how passionate he was with his profession and was also very personable. We shared stories about music and shows and his love for guitars. Helped us pick out a mattress just right for us and guided us with exactly what was going to happen and it did. Free delivery was a plus and the movers were very quick. In and out in no time at all and they were all very respectable. Thanks again, Greg!

This one's brand new and I've only experienced the drive thru but that was pretty much the best part. It was like a video conference when I was ordering which took me by surprise! But it was outstanding service and the building looks solid. I will have to go inside next time.

Really not a bad place. This was our first time here and we were surprised. Got to admit, there was some worry with some of the reviews we saw but we decided to stuck to our guns. I ordered the pad Thai and the gf got the Japanese udon. Both came out steaming hot. Both were big bowls, so the portuon wasnt too bad. I added steak to mine for an extra 2.99. Unfortunately, the amount of steak I got wasn't worth the extra charge. Legit about 5 little pieces.  Both were also delicious full of flavors. Would liked to have seen a little more vegetables, though. We also threw in a 6 piece order of pot stickers. That was 4.99. And they were good. Nothing special. All in all, it was a good experience food wise and we will probably be back. Service could use a little umph of motivation.
