We brought our 2006 Jetta TDI in for a routine oil change & were told that we needed to get our timing belt changed as soon as possible. We had to discuss the cost of the repair, so we took the car home. After deciding that it had to be done to avoid the cost of a new engine should the belt break, we got the car back in that same afternoon. Our service manager was able to work with us on payment so that we paid half then & the other half 2 weeks later. He also pointed us to some coupons online for $100 off any service. And of course, provided a loaner car for the night. On top of completing the work overnight, they also replaced the water pump & anything else that would have needed replacement within the next 10,000 miles. Being a dealership, I was surprised at their competitive pricing, especially on a service that requires so much work to complete. We are happy, happy customers.

I have never been here before, but I will definitely be back. I got the super nacho & man, it was super. The place was packed, which is always a good sign. We ordered & ran next door to get a mega millions ticket. Unfortunately, I didn't win the $640 million, but I did have a full belly.

I've been here a few times lately to visit my brother-on-law & to have some pre-op appointments.  It seems to be clean & well-kept. The staff that I have encounterd has been friendly & helpful. When I have surgery, I know I will be in good hands.

Holy old people! This place was packed with senior citizens until about noon. We had one of the last lanes, along with another young family - us 10 were the only people there under 55. The guy at the front desk was a little out of it, but the guy at the food counter was charismatic & very helpful. I will definitely take the fam here in the future, just as soon as I get the hang of their heavily oiled lanes.

I've never had a bad experience at this location until now. We walked in, waited with 2 other families for too long while all the employees ignored us. And when the hostess finally showed up, she looked like she'd rather have bamboo sticks stuck under her fingernails than seat us. Forget it! I had a bad feeling about how our meal would turn out, so we left.

This location is closest to my house, but like the other reviewers, this is a really rundown, raggety, dirty, smelly location. There are some really nice people that work here, but that doesn't always cut it. It's always busy, with never enough cashiers. And talk about 'People of WalMart'!!! This place is crawling with some real pieces of work.

We reserved a small truck so we could go out of town, up into the mountains, but since every college student in the state of Arizona was moving home for the summer, there were none available. They upgraded us to a SUV for the same price. I would definitely use this location again.

Love this place! There is something for everyone, and you used to be able to find me in every room - hip hop, country, 80's & even creeping around the karaoke room when they had it. My friend and I would sweat the night away & leave only when they kicked us out at 2am. Just don't show up before 10pm, otherwise you'll be wasting precious time.

I completed the "Blazin' Challenge" and whooo buddy was I burnin'. It was fun though. The only con: they make you pay for the challenge, like $20 for the wings, they didn't have our shirts, and your name only stays on the board for a short while. Everything else was good though - wings are great & they have lots of flavors to choose from.

I like this place - it's close to my house, clean, friendly staff, items in stock... I love looking at their home decor section. The produce is overpriced sometimes though. The place gets crowded sometimes. The guy is never at the self checkout desk when I need him to add ice to my order. And there's no cell phone reception in the back of the store, which is seriously annoying when I'm on the phone with my husband trying to see if there's anything else I can pick up.

So, we proceeded to the window to place our order & had to tell the girl 3 times that we wanted a Mc-gridd-le, real slow like so they'd understand English, or so we hoped. But alas, it shan't be. They even had it correct on the receipt, but nay, I tell you, nay. The screwed it up afterall.

We left another Red Robin location after being treated like dirt & came over to this one. We weren't griping necessarily, just commenting to the server about our experience, and he had the GM & manager come over & talk to us. The food was great, as always, and then they took $20 off our bill just for the inconvenience that the other location had caused us. Great staff, great food, and high on our list of places to eat. We will be back!

Ah, yes, Home Depot, my friend. I actually don't like them as a competitor to my husband's business, but for every day items, plants, paint samples, screws and nuts and bolts, and all that other fun stuff, they are a necessary evil. The staff are super friendly & the store is organized. What else can a girl ask for? Except maybe a $5000 gift card to buy all my crafty stuff with?

This particular visit was the 3rd visit I've made to Chipotle in the last few weeks that has been disappointing - subsequently, this will be my last visit. This time, I asked for a carnitas burrito...oh boy! The meat was atrocious - dry, tasted like mold/dirt, and then I got a big chunk or slimy fat & all was done. I couldn't possibly take another bite, nor will I ever again. The only thing they have going for them is the chips & guacamole.

I think I ate more of my husband's garlic fries than he did, and my sweet potato fries with the cayenne ranch were so delish! It was very crowded due to some sporting event, but the service was pretty fast & they kept up on our drinks. I've heard that it depends on the night, but my burger was absolutely flavorless, blah, nothing special and I will probably never eat a burger there again. What's dumb, is that it looked mouth-watering, just tasted like nothing.

I have used these piano movers multiple times & always had quick, efficient, and professional service. I would recommend Max Piano Moving to anyone.

The best pizza in town! You get to design your own or choose from favorites - mine is the Sgt. Pepper. The real sugar rootbeer or birch beer is Ah-mazing! And while you're there,  try the dessert pizzas. Oh, and super affordable!
