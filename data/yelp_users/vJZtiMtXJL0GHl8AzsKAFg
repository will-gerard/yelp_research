Groupon Buyers BEWARE.  Along with Steve, I am also extremely disappointed in the lack of cleanliness here. I purchased the $75 Groupon (thank GOD I didn't waste anymore than that). When I was contacted they said they would be at my house for one hour, because that was what was included in the Groupon. We have cameras in the house due to a previous untrustworthy cleaning lady and could see that they were here today for 36 minutes total.   During those 36 minutes they cleaned: the floors, and dusted an end table. That's it. Not the bathrooms, they didn't even wipe down the counter-tops. The entire house was untouched except the floor and that one end table.  Not only that, but the floors weren't even clean. I took a clean wipe to them when I got home and came up with a dirty, dirty wipe.  I was using this as a test to see if I would use them in the future for bi-weekly cleanings. Needless to say, that won't be happening. And I will be attempting to be compensated for my $75 wasted.  Best of luck to you.  An Update for you: they did come back and clean my house, and did an AMAZING job. What a house SHOULD look like after 4 people cleaned for an entire hour. However, due to the lack of professionalism the first time around, and the outrageous pricing without a coupon I will not use them again.

Everything here is amazing. So authentic and fresh-tasting. The chicken burrito is my favorite!

The two stars here are for the niceness of the girl that has done my nails and for my pedicure. Now, the manicure. I got the SNS manicure and the first time after 2 days it was chipping. I called and went back and the same girl re-did most of my nails (only the chipped ones). Now, 3 days later, every single one of them has cracked or chipped. I'm not particularly hard on my nails and have always done gel with no problem. I don't know if it's just the SNS which they swore was better than gel or if it was the girl that did them. Either way, I won't be going back here and I won't be getting SNS anymore.  Also, the cash only tip policy is ridiculous. I get that you'd prefer cash so you aren't taxed on it but OCCASIONALLY I don't have it on me. And I don't want to be charged a $2 ATM fee every time.

I had no idea this was so close to where I live. The sandwiches here never disappoint, the staff is always friendly and the price is unbeatable for what you get. My only reasoning for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it were a smidge cleaner on the inside.

I have to say I was really impressed with the overall look and feel of La Casa Blanca. When it gets cooler outside I am definitely going to sit on the patio. The service was good, food was good, margarita was a little weak, but overall I will definitely return. Next time I might ask them to not seat me in a room where literally every single table has a screaming child. Oh well!

LOVE THIS PLACE. My only disappointment was when they changed their menu for summer. The regular menu is delicious. I can't wait til they change it back. But this place is really great for some live music, good wine, and good food.

Pizza isn't half bad....but it's way overrated, and overpriced. If I want good pizza there are plenty of places I would think to go before Grimaldi's.

You know, for $6.50, this place is damn good. I got the Wednesday Lunch Special which included a giant gyro, a drink, and a side of hummus. The portion was great for only 6 bucks, and it was delicious. The meat was a tad on the greasy side for me, but other than that, two thumbs up. I will be going back.

My boyfriend and I have been here twice now, and have only had one thing we wouldn't order again. (the scallop and shrimp ceviche). It was a little bland, but everything else was AWESOME.  We had:   Jalapeno Crab Cakes: YUM Angus Burger: so juicy Chicken Medici: soooo good! Lemon butter chicken: good, but not as good as other chicken picatta dishes i have had. Fettucine Pelligrino: good, but a little heavy for me. boyfriend loved it.  The drinks have always been great for us, and we always sit at the bar. The service great and the bartenders are always so friendly.   LOVE IT! Give it a try, despite the cranky people leaving bad reviews. You NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY!

LOVE this place. Great food, high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut), and fun service.  I love this place, and always leave happy and full. Authentic italian food is my weak spot! :)

As someone who is not vegan or vegetarian, I thought this place was pretty good! I went with a friend who is vegan and she was very impressed with everything. The set up inside is a bit jammed but it definitely has a local feel. I don't know if I would be back by myself but if I have someone that's vegan or vegetarian coming into town I'll definitely take them here.

Really glad Yelp is smart enough to filter out the 5 star reviews. If you notice, the exact same people, with the exact same 5 star reviews posted them EVERYWHERE they possibly could.   This place is quite possibly the biggest joke of a business I have ever encountered. My best friend "bought" her dress there. I'm not going to bother typing out how horrid our experience was, but I will say it was RIGHT ON PAR with what everyone else has written.   Do yourself a favor, just don't do it. Ever.

We were SO EXCITED to have a BBQ place close to our house. Our first experience was good, the food was okay (though i've had better BBQ).   Complaints:  -Pulled pork: dry, flavorless, soggy. -Beans/Coleslaw: disgusting. -Cookies: subpar, even though i havent had one. they are still in the shape of the frozen square they come in... no thanks. -Service: unenthusiastic employees, rude.   2nd visit:   -Order was wrong, food gave us both horrible stomach aches... and didn't even taste good. (i only ate my sweet potato fries and ditched my sandwich).  3rd visit:   -Service was horrible -Order was wrong... again. I went back in to let the girl (short brunette) know i got regular fries instead of the sweet potatoes i loved.   She replied with: "Are you sure?".  Me: "I tasted them, and they are regular." Girl: "Oh, well let me go see if you ordered the sweet potato".  ARE YOU KIDDING ME? My tastebuds aren't broken. I had my receipt. Regardless of whether or not YOU put it in right.... I wanted sweet potato fries. Didn't you learn the "customer is always right" rule?  She then proceeded to roll her eyes and go get my fries (which took well over 5 minutes to fry, thaw, or whatever else they do to them).  Needless to say: I won't be returning.

I was really surprised when I read all the bad reviews on here! My boyfriend and I go to BLD all the time. I challenge those that had bad experiences to come back and try some more food. I have had nearly everything on the lunch/dinner menu and can say almost everything was pretty darn good.   The ribs were a bit dry, and the weird ciabatta bread they tried to put the burger on once was not tasty at all... but other than that the food is GREAT.  Good happy hour too!  Just give it a try!

I bring my car here all the time, and they do a far better job than the Cobblestone at Alma School & Germann.   This time was special though. I bough my car at a nasty car dealership who so graciously stamped those dealer stickers on the back of my car. Not wanting anyone to see that, I removed the sticker myself which left the adhesive still stuck to my car.  I asked the guy at the very beginning if he could get it off, and he wet his rag with gasoline and wiped my car. All seemed fine at the time, but after the wash my paint in that area looked totally ruined. I didn't notice until I got home, but went back a week later and spoke with the manager.  The manager was SO NICE and helpful, and had a detail worker come buff out that area of my paint, making it look brand new. No questions, no fuss, just FIXING.   In my opinion, that's how all businesses should be. If you screw something up, I expect you to fix it. If you don't your consumers will hear about it.  Danny's Family gets 4 starts from me!

Quite a fan of this place. It was pretty quiet while we were there, but the server was able to recommend a good Greek beer, and the food was pretty darn tasty. We'll be going back!

This place is great. Exactly what Mill Avenue needed. Something somewhat healthy, homemade, and DELICIOUS. If you haven't been, this place is a must try.

I've used Bronzed Bella twice now and absolutely love it. Great result, no orange, no streaks and it lasts a long time. I recommend this to everyone that is considering any other type of tan whether it's spray or fake bake. Must try!

I always get great service when I'm here. They do great pedicures and manicures. The gel is always spot on.  They use pedicure bowl liners and an autoclave for all their tools. Sterile is just as important as polish quality.

I've been on the hunt for a new pedicure place for months after a nasty experience at another salon nearby. This place is top-notch. Only $20 for a pedicure and they use hot stones. What?! All instruments are autoclaved and single-use. The salon is spotless. The technicians are meticulous and insanely friendly. I'm in love.

Love this little local place. The food is so so good, they have great craft beers on tap, the vibe is so friendly. My go to is pizza and wings. Supporting local is the best way to go and this place has my support!

I've been here a number of times and have always been happy with the food and service. Beer selection is good, wine selection is decent. Ambiance and decor could use some updating but other than that I would come here any time for a good meal!

We have been here numerous times and love it. The beer is awesome, but not for those looking for a Coors Light. You'll need to drink the real stuff to find a beer you like.   The food has always been great. Try the Pork Belly Sliders and Cannoli Nachos.   Service has been good most times but occasionally can be on the slow side. They've been slammed busy every time we are there so I've given a bit of slack on that.

This place has become my favorite Ahwatukee bar. We really needed something like this in the area. The beer here is always wonderful, my favorite is the Mandarin's Best Friend. It has an amazing citrus flavor and is so refreshing for the summer.   I've tried close to everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. My favorite: blackened chicken sliders. Yum!   Occasionally the service can be a little on the slow side, but if you're looking for a fun, relaxed placed to just hang out...Here it is.

Got my nails done here recently. Didn't realize it at the time but she pulled my cuticles so hard they are red and sore still two days later. She also did not use sterile cuticle cutters or pushers. The only thing new or sterile was the new file which they let me keep. That was nice.   Also - $25 for gel is great but included no massage, she missed half my nail with the gel polish in many places and the day after it was already chipping. I went somewhere else and paid full price to have them removed and completely redone. I'll never go back for my nails here.   1 star for the nice lady that did them.  1 star for the sterile use of the nail file.

Updating my review. The place is under new ownership and has really lost some credibility in my eyes. I really want to love it. Ahwatukee needs something like this so badly!   The wine selection is smaller than I hoped for at a "wine bar" and the food could use some attention. The hummus was so salty is was nearly inedible. The bruschetta was decent but nothing special... Almost tasted like sliced bread from a bag. Not toasted.   The flatbread was so soggy I could only eat two small slices and when I was asked why I didn't eat my dinner and explained to them I just didn't like it.. They took 10% off. Oh? So I didn't eat hardly any of the pizza but instead of removing it or offering me something else you only take 10% off? Lame.   They have some things to learn in food quality and customer service. Not planning on returning.

Sandwiches were great. I'd recommend checking out the menu before you go, as it can be a bit overwhelming. The sassy sauce is amazing. Staff was friendly, prices were a little higher than I expected but the portions were great. This place will be our new go-to instead of subway or anywhere else from now on!
