Not impressed.   I called about a month ago to make an appointment for my sister and me. I had gotten the groupon for three mani/pedis and they allow multiple people to use the same groupon, which I thought was nifty. Had to wait a month to get in. That was a pain. But at least we finally got in together, right?   Wrong. We showed up to our 5pm appointments a few minutes early today and my aesthetician greeted me by name when we walked in the door. Said as soon as we filled out paperwork, she was ready for me. Score!   THIRTY MINUTES LATER, my sister still had not been brought back. One of the nail technicians (Daleesha, I believe her name was) had finished with her previous client between 5:10 and 5:15, but decided to go into one of the massage rooms to chat with a coworker, apparently, and left my sister hangin' there. After being confronted by my technician (thanks, Lisa!), Daleesha finally started on my sister's nails after 5:30.   I was all done with both services around 6 o'clock, and when I finally left for work at 6:45, my sister's pedi wasn't done yet.   Incredibly frustrated that our sister date with dinner and drinks at EVO afterward turned into chatting at the nail station because the brow lady was not only running behind (not surprising when their technicians just run off behind closed doors!), but didn't bother taking care of clients who had been waiting for 30+ minutes.   I'll give them another shot because I paid for a third service, but I don't have high expectations, and I won't be back after my groupon is used.

Absolutely love this place! I've lost count of how many dozens of times I've eaten here in the last few years.   My go-tos are the nuts & berries salad, the humanitarian wrap, and the mushroom bisque. Love their egg sandwich on a bialy, too. And I really love that I can get breakfast anytime.   Healthy and d'lish.

This is my favorite spot in the entire Valley, and with their Tuesday night BOGO pizza deal, it can't get any better!  Definitely don't skip the bruschetta! My favorites are the pesto with tomato, the artichoke with roasted red pepper, the garlic, and the queen creek olive with ricotta and basil (which isn't on the menu, so you have to ask for it). Last night, Boyfriend and I ordered two garden pizzas. I think that's my favorite! We've also had their garlic pizza (I probably wouldn't get that one again, but it's the only thing I've been disappointed in on their menu), the truffled mushroom pizza (awesome!), and I LOVE their goat cheese & pear salad.  Boyfriend has also enjoyed the Sicily pizza before.   Two big thumbs up from me. I've been here with friends, with classmates, on dates, and before events at Gammage. I have always left pleased with the experience. Give La Bocca a try! You won't be disappointed.

Amazing place!   I haven't ordered anything from their restaurant yet, but I am a huge fan of their feta stuffed olives, their meyer lemon olive oil, and most of all, the artichoke & garlic tapenade.   They have all their tapenades/spreads out for you to try, which is super awesome, complete with wooden spoons and trash receptacles. They also have an olive oil bar of sorts, with cups you can pour some into and taste it. They have two cremas that are delicious as well.   Make sure you snag some of their recipes! They suggest using olive oil in pancakes, waffles, and crazy things I have never heard of. I routinely make the drive from Tempe just for their tapenade. It's that good!

I went there for lunch when my mom was in town, and finally got to check out their sandwiches. I got their Manzi panini with a side of their pesto pasta salad and mom had the Sevi sandwich.   Their pasta salad wasn't anything special, and Mom thought her sandwich was good, but nothing to write home about. Mine, on the other hand... I have never had a more delicious panini in my life! My mom even tried to eat mine, it was so good.   We also took home some of their olive oil cupcakes. They were just okay. Very moist, but a little too oily for my taste.   VERY crowded. We ended up sitting at a picnic table outside, European style (sharing with strangers). There was hardly room to walk around inside without bumping into 15 different people at once. And yet I would still go back for that delicious panini.

Stay away!  I have never had a worse breakfast experience. I used to live in the apartments right across the street, so I thought it would be a convenient place for a weekend brunch. Boyfriend and I headed over there one Saturday morning to check it out. I ordered a veggie skillet, and he ordered a make-your-own omelet. The menu description for my skillet said "fresh cut veggies." It came out with cauliflower and crinkled carrots. When I raised that point to our waitress, she giggled and said "freshly frozen!" Boyfriend's omelet also came out with only half the ingredients he ordered, and one that he didn't. The only good thing about this place is that they adjusted the check appropriately for our meals.

This makes my top three favorite restaurants in town, for sure. I've been there three times already this month.   The most important thing I think I can say is be specific about your dislikes! You write down what you *don't* like, not what you do, so if your palate is somewhat high maintenance, that needs to be communicated.  Don't go if you're on a time crunch. If you're there before 5:30, the sunset discount is $15 off! And sitting at the bar is super awesome, especially on a slow night.   Their foie gras torchon is the best I've ever had, and Chef Josh always has awesome wine recommendations! This place is a must-try for foodies.

I attended my first class here before this place officially opened, and I've been coming back for 4+ years.   Love their dance fitness classes. I've only been disappointed by two - one instructor that had no rhythm but hasn't been there for about two years, and another (So you think you can dance) class where we learned part of the Thriller dance. Not exactly what I thought I'd be doing, and a little disappointing to that end.   I've finished the first two levels of their pole class, and have enrolled for the next session. It is a little spendy, but so much fun. Class sizes are super small, so you get a decent amount of both feedback and time on the pole.   Christie is awesome, instructors are awesome (super bummed Kathy left!), and the place is a blast. I am often uncomfortable in "social" situations where I don't know anyone (to include group fitness classes), but this place really draws you in and makes you feel connected.

We had a five-star experience, so came back less than 24 hours later. That one was more like 4 stars, so four it is.   I had the Croque Madame both times. The first time, it was absolutely spectacular. Everything I wanted. Perfectly cooked, egg was runny and amazing. Just delightful. The next day, it was considerably slower inside, but my edges were slightly burnt and my egg wasn't runny at all. A little bummed at the night-and-day from one day to the next.   The Mexican corn with Oaxaca was pretty awesome. Got it on recommendation of our server the second day, and was super pleased. Outrageously messy, but good.   The mister got something yummy the first day which I don't remember (but clearly was good enough he didn't complain about going back the next day), and the special turkey reuben the second time. Reuben was interesting - coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. I wasn't totally sold on the idea, but he was happy with it.   We sat on the back patio until our food came. The swarm of flies was tolerable when we didn't have food on the table, but I spent more time swatting them away and defending my plate than I did eating what was on it, so we moved inside. Sat inside the second day and still noticed a few flies on the window, but the experience was much more tolerable.   Friendly service, tasty food, and breakfast available all day. (Super important to a third-shifter!) We'll be back.

The wine list at a new restaurant often makes or breaks the place for me. Shula's' wine list ROCKS! You want a cab by the glass? They have three. A bottle of Montrachet? You've got it! Afraid of most restaurant wine prices? The prices here are some of the most reasonable I've seen. I'd definitely return just for the wine list.   We got a small tour of the photos, with the replica trophy pointed out. A little strange, but not the super-weird experience some others mentioned.   I started off with the French onion soup. Stellar. For an entree, I had their lamb porterhouse. Five stars. Our server got out his nifty little penlight and had us check the temperature before he left the table. Two thumbs up there. It was perfectly medium rare. That they have a lamb steak makes me incredibly happy, and the wine-mint glaze that accompanies said lamb is divine.   The sides didn't wow me. Three stars. The crab mac was definitely tasty, but I guess I was expecting big chunks of crab, which I never found. Plenty of crab flavor; I just had different expectations, I suppose. The grilled asparagus was also good, but nothing I couldn't make at home. The green beans were probably my fave. The citrus glaze and julienned peppers were an awesome combination. They were a little sweet for Dad, but I was pleased.   I was too stuffed for dessert, so I can't chime in there.   Possibly the most impressive part of our night was the service. I came in with my dad, who was visiting from 3000 miles away. Neither of us had ever been to a Shula's. When the floor manager, Jon, heard that it was a treat for us, he made sure we were more than taken care of. Or perhaps their service really is that amazing. Either way, five stars plus.   Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Mostly. I'll be back.

Yum! We were here for Restaurant Week, and the mister was definitely glad he forgot to make reservations elsewhere.   Sat down at their last available table outside and noticed a couple near the edge getting ready to leave. We mentioned it to our hostess and were told that we could move momentarily. Awesome! Our table was quickly snatched up as soon as we moved, so their willingness to accommodate us was appreciated.   Love their little plate with an assortment of water flavorings. Cucumber, lemon, and lime slices - one of each per guest at the table.   Started out with the beet salad. So good! The candied pecans had the perfect amount of cinnamon in the glaze. The mister had the lobster bisque. He was a little disappointed that there wasn't more lobster (only one decently-sized piece in the bowl), but liked it well enough.   They took our drink orders before bringing the first course, and when I ordered two different glasses at different times, the server (maybe the somm? A different server than the one who took our orders) knew which courses I had ordered and clarified the foods. Top notch service right there.   We added on the beef carpaccio appetizer between the first course and our entrees. It was good, but not quite what I was expecting. Their seven-minute fried egg didn't live up to my expectations. Very little yolk still runny, plus the breading was a little off-putting. I don't like breaded and subsequently fried foods, but the man wasn't sold on it either. Didn't get the hype there. The chive cream was an EXCELLENT compliment, and the mustard was delicious, though a little overpowering.   My lamb shank entree was strangely sweet and not what I was looking for, but the farro accompaniment was outstanding. I left meat on the bone, but hoovered all the farro. So good. The beef medallions were spectacular! Perfectly done, tender, and juicy. I was almost regretting not ordering the beef for myself.   For dessert, I had ordered the semifreddo, and was served the icebox cake. Not sure if this was a mixup on their part or not, but it was still tasty and I never mentioned anything to the contrary. The grapefruit was a strange choice next to the chocolate and caramel, as the caramel overpowered it, but the cake itself was so tasty it didn't really matter. The frozen yogurt came out with a plentiful serving of gorgeous, fresh berries. Both of us were happy there.   The cappuccino after dessert came with cubed sugar, and they allowed us to grab the cup and go walking around the grounds.   $150 before tip, with Restaurant Week pricing. I probably would've been happier if I would have spoken up about the lamb, but we'll be back. Great food and excellent service.

Their mediums are huge! I couldn't even finish mine.   Came here on a Saturday early evening, around 5. No one in line in front of us, but it still took a good 10-15 minutes to get our bowls. Not the end of the world, but slightly inconvenient.   Once we received them, though...   I got the Tropical and the mister, the Original. I think I might have liked mine better, but his was pretty tasty as well. Delicious granola. Super sweet, but only natural sugars. When we were waiting, we saw one of the girls leave with a bunch of reusable grocery bags, and come back from Sprouts about 20 minutes later with two bags completely full. Their fruit is definitely fresh.   We'll be back, and order smalls next time.
