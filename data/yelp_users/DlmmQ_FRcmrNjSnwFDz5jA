Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said "Oh, it will be out in a few minutes". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people.   The food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.  We will definitely never be eating here again.

Very clean and great service! I'm 7 months pregnant and was in need of a pedicure. They did a great job! The hot stones felt amazing on my calves and the lady really took her time massaging my feet.   I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to manicures and pedicures but this place definitely left me satisfied. I will be returning in another 2/3 weeks for another pedi.

I don't leave reviews often but Del Sol definitely deserved a review for their service. I'm a new home owner and I was having some pool issues I just couldn't figure out. I'd had multiple pool owners come over and see if they could help and nothing.  I decided to call a professional. I had one company come out and tell me it was my cleaner and I may need to drain the pool because it was too green. I decided to get a second opinion (thankfully) and gave Del Sol a shot.   Tom came the next day, he educated me about the different filters, gave me some tips on maintaining my pool, and put some chemicals in it to bring it back from the dark side. In two days my pool was sparkling blue, I cleaned out my DE filter (Tom recommended) and my cleaner was working better than ever.  Thank you Del Sol for your honest service and great price. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone.

Definitely recommend and would take my son there again. We arrived right when they opened and were seen right away. The staff was friendly and the Doctor was very kind, patient, and caring. She took the time to explain what symptoms were normal and what to keep an eye on. Overall a great experience.
