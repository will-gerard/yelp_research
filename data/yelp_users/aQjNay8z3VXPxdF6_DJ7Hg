I have never been to a Macaroni Grill since living in AZ so I was more than thrilled when my family decided to get together and go! My first impression when we walked in was that the ambience was beautiful and for a saturday night it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. The ambience was immediately ruined once we walked in and an expeditor in a mint green shirt who I witnessed yell "don't touch me!" to a server who tapped him on the shoulder who clearly had a question concerning an order. What an asshole! Our server Taylor was a sweetheart and gave us great service:) My family ordered the Mediterranean sea bass, the shrimp portofino and the pan-roasted pork chops. It was all amazing! I also recommend the goat stuffed peppadew peppers they are delicious. Ps: their balsamic reduction sauce is money!

The incompetent girl taking pizza orders for delivery last night clearly sucks at her job. She said her delivery driver was outside my place calling me several times and even left a message. Prove it. We waited an hour and she didn't think to try calling the number as well? Instead she just cancelled my order all together. I know for a fact I gave her the correct phone number. It definitely wasn't a mistake on my behalf that's for damn sure. I recommend you don't go here. EVER. She hung up on me and blamed me for it. Unreal. Customer service here blows. She didn't even try and make it right and send me a new one. Go to Z Pizza, Pino's or Dominos. Seriously anywhere but here! Especially if that girl still somehow has a job there.

Waited 50 minutes today for a pulled pork and a hot link sandwich before asking for our money back. I can't imagine how much longer we would of had to wait. I've heard nothing but good things about this place....so disappointed. They weren't even busy!!
