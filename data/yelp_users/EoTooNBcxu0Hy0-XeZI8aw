At first they're standoffish and a little reserved, but I think it's having to deal with some of the fussiest jewelry designers and metal artists in the Valley. They try to assess you as you walk through the door and try to anticipate your type of personality...that's a good thing.  While it may look like a hole in the wall or a place that won't carry more than an ounce of silver, Lonnie's Inc really has so much more going for it....whether you're into enamelling or beading, this place is it.  I miss their other location out in Mesa, but that got closed down last summer.  For now, I make the drive to Lonnie's in Phoenix and each time I've gone, I've yet to be disappointed.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

I thought this Fry's closed a little later on a Friday night - either 11pm or midnight.  Nope. 10pm. I got there, knowing what I wanted and needed. My friend also got what she wanted as well...no announcements that the store was closing. My friend and I were at the self-checkout...for the record, I hate those things because I feel like they're taking away from the workforce, but that's just me, though.  Anyway, the lone cashier that was open looked like she had a huge line, so I opted to use the self-checkout.  I got my stuff and my friend started to ring up her purchases...*machine stops working*  "Oh, were you going to buy that? I thought you were both done. I turned off the registers." and continued to make a fuss about what a pain it was to turn them back on. Really? Turn the key to the right. That's all she has to do...unless she needs to call in a manager or something. I don't know about their procedures to re-open registers.  I kept thinking, "No, she's just going to walk out with it."  Instead my friend said, "Well, since it's clearly so much hassle for you to turn the registers on, then I'll take my business elsewhere. There are other stores that are open."  "Oh no, it's not that...let me turn on the registers again."   Somehow she made it sound like she was doing us the favor...and she turned a key and entered in a code and VOILA! the register was open again...all that attitude from the person monitoring the self-checkout just to have her turn a key and enter a code? Lame.  At the end, when she realized that it wasn't a $2.00 purchase, she was all smiles.  Long story short: go before closing, preferably before the sun sets because it's a little scary...and the parking lot is a little on the dirty side, as was the rest of the store. I saw where some people had munched on donuts, then tossed them into a shelf, hiding it behind some items, hoping it wouldn't be spotted. GROSS.

It was all right. I really can't say anything, to be honest. It's not quite a 3 star, but it's not even really a 2. Service was nice and the people were nice, but the food was a bit..."eh."  Nothing to write home about. Prices were nice and cheap.  I'll shell out a few more bucks and hit Rosa's. It's more flavorful. While LT has a decent kick, the flavor is a bit ho hum.  The tortillas were nice and fresh...that was the best part of the meal. I had ordered the carne asada burrito. It wasn't spiced as much as I thought it would be. Maybe they were hoping the sauce that was in it would make up for the bland spicing.  The sauce had a small bit of kick and was all right. The carnitas tacos were a bit of a let down...the meat was dry, but the salsa was all right.  If you're looking for fast and easy, this is it. If you want food brought to you and you can relax, I'd suggest going to a sit down restaurant.  This had too much of a fast food feel for my taste.

This lovely place I discovered in Las Vegas when I lived there.  (The one in vegas is on Alta between Rainbow and Buffalo near sushi on summerlin, but I've heard it's moved since then.)  I would have given this 5 stars, but I have found that their roast beef sandwich leaves a little to be desired -- mostly because it's like shredded roast beef, so it's a bit bland and extremely dry.  That aside, everything else just flies into the hearty flavorful sandwich realm.  I would recommend the Mushroom Cheese Steak, Grilled Italian or Meatball sandwich.  Their specials Capastrami (hot pastrami, cole slaw, swiss cheese and russian dressing) and The "Bobbie" (turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo) are something to get all hot and bothered over.  Capriotti's also has Vegetarian Sandwiches -- soy Turkey, Balogna, Salami and burgers -- if you are not a meat eating kind of person.  Overall, I love Capriotti's, but am happy they are quite a ways away.  I'd eat there at least 3 times a week if they were closer.

Coming from the Bay Area up in California, I'm spoiled when it comes to Japanese noodle houses. I'm also spoiled when it comes to Japanese comfort food.  This, my dear...is freaking fabulous. It's not ridiculously expensive and it made my very fussy hubby fabulously happy.  I ordered the chicken katsu don while he got a bowl of veggie noodle curry. Mmm...we also ordered california rolls. While it had krab in it, the rest of the ingredients were so wonderfully fresh I forgave the krab.  Good Japanese noodle houses are hard to come by, but this is definitely a great place...and only around the corner from our house! Yay. :)

I love this place. It's a stone's throw from my house and if the weather is good I can walk there. I've been coming to this place for over 2 years. I did deviate and go to VooDoo Nail Salon, but they have closed down...and I went back to Nail 8000.  I love getting pedicures only from here - they do this callus removal thing that makes me want to weep because it's so good. The girls try to be conversational and friendly, but ya know...sometimes I don't want that.  The leg massages are great because they promise a set time (think it's 10-15 minutes) of a leg massage and they don't skimp on it, either. They've ruined it for me for other places with leg massages.  They do tend to try and push nail art on your toes, but I have to be in the mood for that! The pedicure I choose is usually $28 and after time spent in India, I cringe at the price...but the leg massage...*drools* The girls do try and talk to you during your leg massafe and sometimes I feel a bit anti-social because I just want to take a quick nap, but I chat anyway because they are such sweethearts that I can't help *but* talk. :)  I still get my  nails done at The Pampered Pinkie! :)  Nail polish selection could be better, but it's ok, I've got over 100 bottles to choose from back at the house so it's not like I'm going to be starved for a color!  FYI - They don't like it if you add tips on with your credit card - they prefer cash for that.

I love this Starbucks...well I love everyone that works there, save for one redheaded surly girl. My cousin and I call her Sister Surly and the moment we see her, we head on off to the other Starbucks on Dobson and Warner.  It's your typical Starbuck's fare -- coffee and pastries.  Next door is  Jamba Juice, across the parking lot is a Massage Envy and then next door to that is the Good Egg. You can have breakfast and then go to Starbuck's after.  Overall, this Starbuck's is my favorite in the Valley...except when Sister Surly works...

In addition to doing all our 'let's fix it up before it falls down completely' mission for our home, we needed to take care of our citrus trees.  Thanks to a thoroughly incompetent person who was staying in our home, they turned off the sprinklers for 2 months...leaving our grapefruit and orange trees to die - in addition to our lawn.  The people here were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the basics - aside from, "Have you turned on your sprinklers again?" (yes, we have) - and offered some good advice for the trees.  This is our second time coming here and we're definitely fans since they're right around the corner from us!

I originally started in the other Family Vetcare in Ahwatukee, but swapped to here when I discovered there was one closer to the house.  Even my cousin ended up taking her extremely hissy pissy cat here and there no problems - she was extremely happy with how they treated Princess Hissy. He's a very troubled cat.  I take Rex here because it's close to the house and he loves the vets...and the vets love him.  My only complaint is that they don't have grooming services here for him. Boo!  The newer one in Ahwahtukee is actually like...I don't know? The mothership? It's all super shiny and brand new, but the service in both places are excellent.

Carrabba's is a treat for me. I know it's a chain. Believe me, I know.  But usually most restaurants that are chains are chains for a reason - they're good enough and consistent enough with enough appeal to many eaters.  This is the case with Carrabba's.  My friend Cathy ordered the Mezza Luna - ravioli that was stuffed with some yummy ingredients and a tomato cream sauce. She let me have a couple of pieces and I let her have some of mine. I ordered the Rigatoni Martino - chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and a creamy tomato sauce.  It was lovely. Really lovely.  However, an hour after dinner, I was developing this unholy thirst. Like, I needed water, NOW. I guzzled a lot of water after - about 3 liters, but I was *still* thirsty. I noticed my rings were a bit tight on my fingers.  Uggh...it was too salty. Mercifully they didn't use MSG, but I hope they will cut back on the salt. Even as I write this almost 24 hours later my fingers are still swollen. :(  Service was A+, food was good, company was good. All in all, a great dinner with good food.

I am a pizza snob...I had stuft pizza while growing up and the original Round Table Pizza as well - you have to love the Bay Area.  I never found pizza that was comparable to Stuft Pizza in all the places that I lived - okay, aside from Vegas -- there was North Side Nathan's.  The crust here at Barro's is very close to Stuft Pizza and that is why hubby and I love it so much. It doesn't taste over processed and from a mix. It tastes like it's made there every day - a bonus!  Their wings are pretty tasty and a bit bigger than we expected, which is a good thing.  :)  We prefer having them deliver or going to pick up the pizza ourselves. It's clear that it's a very loud place...and I don't do loud places too well. ;) Well, that and I dislike little children running around me trying to beg for food off me.  Definitely a thumbs up from hubby and myself!  Now if they only had pesto pizza on the menu...

Wow. I have never been blown away by breakfast as I was here. Never.  Simple. Hearty. Filling. Good price. What more can I ask for?  I ordered (can't remember the name...my bad) a croissant with eggs, cheese and bacon in it which came with a side of fresh fruit. I was greeeeedy heffa and ordered a side of their homestyle potatoes/fries. OMG they were so good and a little different from what I've normally been served...they were buttery, creamy and tasted of dill or a different type of season one doesn't usually experience. The potatoes were soft and crunch at the SAME TIME~ I know, I'm so easy to please...but it was so worth it.  Hubby ordered the Three Musketeers and he was suitably impressed as well...he cleared everything off on his plate and looked so happy. After an early start of hitting the mall (to get his computer fixed) and then me dragging him around Home Depot (lights needed to be replaced), this was such a lovely way to get in a late breakfast at 11am.  I'll definitely be back to try their other items on the menu - it all looks so wonderful.

What a surprise this place is.  I hate flyers on my door and nearly tossed it, but something made me save this menu.  The other night I had a craving for chinese food and dug this up.  We ordered their coconut shrimp (it came with steamed broccoli), chicken chow fun and eggplant.  I think it's safe to say I've found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  I went to go pick it up since it's close to the house.  I'm directionally challenged so what should have taken me a 10 minute drive ended up being a 20 minute drive.  It's located on the corner of Alma School and Warner in the Goodyear plaza.  It didn't help that the traffic light was out on the corner so traffic was backed up.  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes.  The chow fun was to DIE FOR.  I'm a chow fun fanatic and I was in love!  Noodles were not super soggy and the containers are not your standard cardboard fare, either.  The coconut shrimp was fab - the sauce was on the side.  My only complaint is that there were no holes for the hot air to escape so the batter was a bit soggy.  No worries, it was still scrumptious.  The eggplant is flavorful.  It was not drowning in soy sauce.  Just enough for your rice.  Oh...and the rice is FREE.  You don't have to order it separately and be charged extra like some places in the valley.  They claim to NOT use MSG in their dishes and that's the truth.  I'm allergic to MSG and I would know in under 3 minutes...  The overall ambiance is really more to go than in dining.  They have a picnic table set up that consists of one bench.  Now that I know where I can find this gem, I'll be sure to go back.  If you haven't tried it, go...NOW.

If you're into nail polish and are totally slutty for it like I am, you will love this place. It houses the kick butt brands I love -- China Glaze, OPI, Essie, etc. It's a little on the ratty side and things are massively disorganized.  Located around the corner from Lee Lee's, you can park right in front of the store and not have to worry about fighting past the bad drivers in the Lee Lee's parking lot -- again, as I've said before, so many Asian drivers in one spot = bad. My peeps at their finest!  Keep an eye out on the prices when you're checking out -- they might over charge you by a dollar on the nail polish that claim to only be $1.50.   You can also get a jug of lotion for $15 -- I kid you not! The last time I was there, I purchased 10 bottles of the current OPI Fall Collection Colors (their France line) and a big bottle of some mango lotion for $40.  I love nail polish and this place is the bomb.  They've also got nail supply things galore -- files, block files, etc. If you don't like paying to get your nails done, you can certainly try to purchase things from here to give it a go. It won't break your wallet, that's for sure!  It's not a wheelchair friendly place, btw. The aisles are extremely narrow and they tried to pack so many things into a very small retail space. I wouldn't even recommend it for people who are on crutches or on a walker, either -- the rows are extremely narrow and 2 people can't pass each other in them...but OMG! The nail polish!  lol  They only take cash, debit, visa or mastercard -- no amex or discover. boo...hiss!

Blech, yech, YUCKY.  Complete and utter disappointment.  I'd sooner go to Taco Bell and Del Taco before I would ever set foot in Filiberto's, Rigoberto's, Aliberto's or any of the 'bertos in that chain.  Yuckity yuck yuck yuck YUCK.  Did I say YUCK?  Best Mexican by far I've found here has to be Rosa's.

Been to C Fu many times.  Figured I may as well write a review now.   I've only been to C Fu for dim sum.  Since leaving my comfort zones of the Bay Area and Las Vegas, I was dying for dim sum.  What a gem this place is.  It's loud, crazy and over crowded on the weekends, but service is fast, nice and friendly.  I love the dim sum.  Dare I say I've found my all time favorite dim sum place ever?  I think I am going to!  We've taken some of my husband's co-workers to dim sum -- we think it may have been a bit too exotic and overwhelming for them.  We didn't care, we still ate.  A definite place to be for cheap group eats.

I love Lee Lee, but so many bad Asian drivers in one centrally located spot -- truly my peeps at their finest. I just wait until an hour - ish before closing time and everything is fairly quiet and sometimes they're putting out veggies for the next day. WOO HOO! Forget the early bird, I'm a night owl.  As for the "weird smell" as one yelper described, I ignore it. Truth is, I'm used to it and I know it's the same smell of any asian market, hell even parts of Chinatown in San Francisco. I've smelled worse things while traveling the world. Lee Lee's your typical Asian market (shout out to 99 Ranch in the Bay Area!), but better organized than other markets I've been to. The aisles are clearly marked - Chinese, Indian, etc. If you can't navigate it, then how you navigate the roads here makes me wonder if you should be driving at all.  Since I'm hard pressed to find inexpensive Filipino food here in the valley, I find I have to make it myself. Lee Lee's carries all the stuff that I need to try (really, it's try, but never accomplish) and replicate my mom's dishes.  It's also really nostalgic for me as well when I go down the cookie/candy aisle and see things like the Strawberry Pocky sticks or the chocolate Pocky sticks...It reminds me of going to Japantown in San Jose on Sundays after church so mom could get the ingredients for her menus of the week. But what really makes Lee Lee a winner in my eyes is the desserts from Goldilocks Bakery as well as their assortment of breads.  I'm a total starch slut, so seeing Pan de Sal and the Filipino desserts makes me happy. I buy a few things and then put them in the fridge so I can munch on them during the week.  I also love their frozen food section as well - you can find such a variety of frozen potstickers, Indian food, sea food...it's a wonder one even thinks of going anywhere else.  I like Lee Lee's a lot and their selection of fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the better places in the valley...unless you support your local farmers.  Service can be rude, but I don't expect hearts, flowers and puppies in places like this. It is what it is - an Asian market.

Yea, I admit it. I ate here. I even admit I like it. For a chain.  I can't believe I liked it. My first experience with Mimi's Cafe was back in Vegas, when it first opened on my side of town in Summerlin. The food and the service was deplorable. I vowed I'd never go back there, not knowing it was a chain...I should've known better.  Fast forward ten years. I'm in Arizona and I'm near the Chandler Mall. I don't want mall food. I didn't feel like In N Out and frankly, that hot dog man at Lowe's wasn't gonna cut it either.  I eyed Mimi's Cafe. Was it going to make me happy? The decor made me want to hurl. It's too busy. Too fussy, frilly, froo-froo girlie girl for me. I wanted to burn that checkered table cloth. Putting that weird plexiglass thing on top of that checkered table cloth? It made me feel like I was back at my mother's house and she would be screaming, "COASTER!!!!!" any time I thought about putting a glass down on any table.  Anyway, I decided to order the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta. While waiting, bread was brought to the table...but not just any kind of bread...we're talking almost like pound cake bread...like cinnamon nut spice cake. I wanted to cry. I had to eat it. HAD TO. IT MADE ME.  The Turkey Pesto Ciabatta  was heavenly. I can't believe that I had such good food. The turkey was warm, the pesto was nice...the bacon made me happy...I am still floored it was so good.  Maybe I'll have to try something else, but for now, Mimi's gets 4 stars. Sorry, no 5 stars...because my awful experience from Vegas is still forever burned into my memory.

Hubby got his Mac Book Pro here and after a year, needed some work done it...He had done memory upgrades when he bought it and when he brought it in, when they ran the diagnostics they have to put it back as close to default as possible. So they removed the 2 extra gigs of RAM he had bought...when we got home, he noticed 2 gigs of ram was missing.  Of course, nothing could be done about it because we'd already left the store...grrr...granted it's only $40, but still...if we're taking stuff to you guys, please have the courtesy of restoring the mac to its original post purchase state with memory, ya know?  Also, we gave them his phone number...which seems to cause massive confusion and I really hate it when they talk down to him because he has a 408 area code, NOT 480. They always ask, "are you sure?" To which one of us always has to reply, "Yes, we're sure. We've had our numbers for the last 10 years - they are northern California numbers." We still get blank stares. So even after the girl made notations about our area code, we still didn't get a call back because they had to order in the needed part...grrr....we called today and guess what? It's been there, but no one could reach us - it's the whole 408 vs 480 thing.  Anyway, 2 stars for now since they totally ripped us off on hubby's memory. Let's hope the repair goes much better.

Update: They didn't misplace or leave the memory out...it was merely dislodged so it didn't register on start-up. WOOT! :)  Now if they can only get the 408 area code right...

I love Red Robin's all you can eat fries -- too bad I can only consume the ones that come with my meal.  I have good memories of Red Robin -- my college days when we'd go to the Red Robin out in Daly City and split burgers and gorge on the fries. When I left San Francisco for Las Vegas the last meal with my friends from the Bay Area was at Red Robin.  I'm glad that no matter where I have been there has been a Red Robin to eat at. I get moments where I must have their bacon cheeseburger. I fiend for their fries.  My only universal complaint about Red Robin is that it is freaking LOUD in there. I mean the kind of loud that is so obnoxious that I feel I have to take some aspirin. But what I do see everytime are happy smiling faces from their customers. They must be doing something right!  Food can be a bit salty because they put their seasoning on *everything* (I half expected it to be in my ice tea, too) - and their seasoning contains MSG. So being the fussy girl that I am, I always ask that absolutely zero seasoning be put on my food. Yea, call me a killer of fun, but would you rather spend time with me eating and laughing or watching me be carted off in an ambulance to the nearest emergency room?  What I also love about Red Robin is their strawberry shake...I haven't had one in a long time, but I know that if I even have one drop, I won't be able to stop. I will want strawberry shakes until I die. So I try to take a sip off of friends' shakes...which usually turns into a brain ache slug that leaves them with more whipped cream than shake.  :D  Oops, my bad!  I really do love their chocolate malts, too. That is such a wonderful dessert.  I've found service at this particular Red Robin to be extremely attentive and friendly.  I always leave with a smile on my face and an ache in my gut (a good ache, not a bad one!).

Housed in the Chandler Mall, this one just doesn't cut it like the stand alone ones. I've found the cookies to be inconsistent in terms of texture and flavor - some days it's good, others I just wonder if they went a wee bit too happy on the sugar.  Sandwiches are ok, but I find there is always something distinctly lacking in their flavor. I just can't put my finger on it.  While this is not my favorite location, when I want a sugar cookie or a chocolate chip cookie fix, this one sure beat Mrs. Fields.  Upon reading other reviews, I could've sworn I've seen Paradise Bakery in California - southern california.

I am no stranger to BJs - I grew up in California, which is where this chain originated from.  I'm not a fan of this BJs. We live about 10 minutes away from it, but I find we go to the one on Superstition Springs more often. We go to BJ's for the food, never the drinks.  Hubby's a huge beer lover. When we lived in San Francisco, we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness.  Anyway, we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here, more specificially, their brewmaster. He'd read rave reviews and thought, "why not?  we're practically around the corner!"  Off we trotted and he ordered the beer and I ordered a salad...and he was angry.  Angry at beer. What?! Not again. It's ok.  I was angry at my salad and the slower service.  He finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino, across the street from the Apple campus (yes, as in iPod). He and his best drinking mate, Matt, went for beer...one they ordered tasted like Juniper. The second one he ordered "tasted like how sweaty gym socks smelled". His exact words.  *gags a little*  He thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistaken  BJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer, I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven!  My salad pissed me off.  There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don't want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke.  My suggestion?  Seriously? Skip this BJs and go eat at one of the other restaurants. This one won't do it for beer...or food.

I am a complete fish lover.  Growing up that was my staple -- fish, all kinds of seafood, octopus, lobster, crab...I think you get the idea.  I had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!  Hubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.  What a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.  Words cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.  I ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.  The sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was "ok" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.  It was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.  When my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.  Surly much?  I can't give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.  Not a place I would recommend for friends or out of towners.

*shakes head*  I am baffled. Truly baffled. How does a place like this stay in business?! It's kinda...crap. Well, not kind of, it is.  I've been there on about 5 different occasions. The first 3 were cringeworthy. I have to confess that all the times I went was because I happened to be close by and the people I was with were all gung ho about it. Truth be told, if they had waited about 10-ish minutes, I could've had them at a different mexican restaurant -- a million times better than Serrano's.  The 4th time I went, the chicken enchiladas I had were so incredibly good, I felt that it made up for the previous times. I happened to be in the neighborhood several weeks ago and dropped into Serrano's.  Nuh uh. Nerp. Nope. Hell to the no. F*ck no. Never again. My chicken enchiladas was gross...and I've never called any mexican food gross. This was pathetic beyond description.  Avoid this place. The only truly redeeming quality were the servers we have had each time I've gone there - fast, friendly and courteous. Sadly, it's not enough to make me want to go back.

Hubby and I used to come here all the time and we've always had good experiences. Lately when I've been on that side of town and wanted sushi, I'd go to Temari, remembering how good it used to be.  Not anymore -- I made excuses for their decline in standards.  I'm not sure if that sushi chef was being trained, etc, but the rolls were a bit off -- they fell apart easily and the fish just didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being. The rice for the sushi tended to fall apart far too easily -- that was pissing me off. I had more rice in my soy sauce dipping bowl than on the actual sushi roll itself. Yea, I was pretty peeved, but that was nothing compared to what had happened minutes before...  Their sushi menu is a bit confusing as well. I am used to a menu where you can check things off on the left hand side of the column, not the far right. I made the mistake of checking the box off to the left, thinking I was ordering california rolls and an eel roll. Imagine my surprise when sashimi arrived instead of nigiri.  They charged me for my mistake. It was an honest mistake and frankly, I love sashimi, but I've recently had a bad experience with sashimi in California that left me feeling like I was hovering close to death...I was in zero mood for raw fish. What should have cost me about $18 in sushi ended up being $30 for my mistake...lunch there used to cost me somewhere between $15-$20, including tip. When all was said and done, the bill was $42 for 2 people...and my cousin hadn't even ordered sushi!  My cousin had ordered the chicken teriyaki which she said tasted like they had just straight out added corn flour to soy sauce. She said she'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life. The chicken was overcooked and the only thing I *think* she enjoyed was the salad on her plate...oh and the rice that came with the meal.  The end of the meal came with complimentary ice cream -- as if that could make me think about coming back here again.  The service was fine, but I found the tables a bit sticky...like they didn't wipe it down well enough. I had forgotten how cramped it felt in there until I stepped through the doors.  Sayonara Temari...you lost a once faithful customer. I discovered Sakana and Four Seasons.

I held the hand of my friend when she went in for her back surgery in October of 2008. Her healthcare provider had recommended Terry McLean.  Of course, I decided to do research! Who knew he was one of the valley's most eminent surgeons?  He was personable, friendly and talked her through everything...and he also addressed concerns I had for her as well. He even pointed out where her previous doctor had gone wrong in his initial diagnosis!  Post surgery care has been wonderful and I couldn't have asked for a better doctor for her. She was even up and walking in under 8 hours, which she is supposed to be doing. It was painful for her to get out of bed, but once she got on her feet she was good to go - which is always good news. When she had her first surgery done back in Oregon, it took her 2 days to get walking or feel anything in her legs.  As a former healthcare worker (hello, UCSF!), I called my old contacts and they reassured me that he was the best you can find in the valley.  Dr McLean's office is located in Scottsdale and is easy to find...I'd recommend him.

My friend has this seriously strange love with Red Robin.  She called me on Thursday, "I'm forwarding an email to you. It's a coupon from Red Robin - let's go! My treat!! But you have to print the coupon for me!" So I hopped in my little car and off I went to PHX.  We sat in the parking lot and she went, "Oh...it's  Mimi's Cafe. Do we want Mimi's or Red Robin?! Nevermind, I have a coupon for Red Robin, let's go!!"  It wasn't late on a Friday night - about 8:30pm...and the restaurant was really quiet. We waited at the entrance, waiting for someone to seat us, but no one came forward. I noticed at the end of the bar a girl on the phone, giggling and laughing into the receiver...I had a sinking feeling she'd be the one to seat us. She saw us a couple of times and turned her back each time. After a few more mins she came and sat us down...turned out she would be our server as well. *sigh*  She was great in ordering, but as for refilling drinks? Not so much. Didn't help that the restaurant was 4% full. It's hard keeping track of all 2 of your tables, isn't it?  I enjoyed my fish burger, but not my fries. I ended up eating some of my fries because well...I was hungry and it was clear she wasn't going to come back after she dumped the bill on us. Oh wait, she did come back as I was halfway through my food (I am a slow eater) and tried to take my friggin plate away. Why didn't I enjoy my fries? It looked and tasted like the kitchen had taken old fries and refried them. :(  "Oh, I'm sorry. I totes thought you were done!" *insert insipid airhead giggle here*  I had food in my hands and I was chewing. What gave her the idea I was done?  I couldn't even ask for water because my mouth was full. I should've because I ran out of water...and I was thirsty by the time the meal ended.  There was more 'small things that added up to a whole big amount of pissed off customers' in my friend and I, but I won't even go there.  As a former waitress, just because it's slow it doesn't mean that your service has to slack...ok?  If my friend *ever* suggests this Red Robin again, I'll tell her I'd rather go to McDonald's.

When hubby and I first landed in Mesa, we were had a fierce craving for Indian food. We pulled up google and did a search which led us to Royal Taj.  We had literally been in Mesa for a few days and were used to Indian food in Britain. We found this place ok, but not as flavorful as we would have liked.  ...Two Years Later...  After lacklustre Indian food and mindbendingly tasteless curries from different places, I decided to give this place one more try. It's also ten minutes away from my house.  I will have to change my mind about this place - the curry is wonderful and their tandoori chicken is just barely made on this side of heaven.  I will recommend Royal Taj to anyone who wants good Indian food.  This is my favorite Indian place - until I find a new one.  :D

By far, hands down, the BEST taco/burrito place in Vegas for a take out place.  I love fried foods, even though I try not to eat it a lot.  Out of all the Mexican places I've eaten at in Las Vegas, California and Arizona, Roberto's houses the best chimichanga ever.  There is a Roberto's in Arizona, but it is literally 50 miles away from my home.  I miss Roberto's.  It's one of the things that I loved about living in Vegas -- it was 24 hours.

I loved this place - we used to live around the corner from it and would walk there and stumble back home from a night of drinking...  One night I decided to eat there, I figured, "Why not? I'm here and if I get sick, Walgreen's is next door and I can walk there to get something to settle my stomach...or buy a pack of smokes!"  After eating there, it became a place where hubby and I could meet friends at any time of the night since their kitchen is 24 hours. It's a fun place for greasy food...and I fell in love with their Philly Cheesesteaks. I don't know what it was, but I never had a bad philly cheesesteak there -- ever. Best of all, we could have beer with our pancakes at 3am if we wanted. Not many can boast about that...wait, maybe that's not something to be proud of.  At any rate, their breakfasts are great, too. Hubby and I could split a stuffed french toast breakfast, but more often than not we didn't because he didn't want to share. HAH!  The last time I was there with my cousin, I was a bit shocked at how different it was.  The clientele seemed a bit older and a lot more cranky.  Maybe we just got there at the wrong time, but it wasn't the Charlie's Down Under I remember getting ripped at and then stumbling back home at 4am.  Overall, I still love this place.

In a previous review I made of Roberto's in Las Vegas, I don't think I mentioned Roberto's here. This is part of the Roberto's chain that can be found in Vegas and San Diego. Please don't confuse it with Filiberto's or Rigoberto's or any of the other 'berto's here in AZ. This Roberto's in the gas station uses the same recipes as the ones in Vegas.  It's a huge trek for hubby and I to make from where we are, but it's worth it.  The owner told us that it is indeed part of the Roberto's chain in Las Vegas, but they had branched out and decided to settle in Phoenix...the recipes are the same and I could taste the consistency in the flavor and the menu.  I had always loved their chicken chimichangas and their super nachos...along with their carne asada. I never knew I would crave it!  What I've always noticed about Roberto's is that they're always clean -- their kitchen is impeccable. Although the layout isn't like in Vegas (you can watch them cook your food and see exactly how clean and exacting their standards are), the food that comes out of the kitchen certainly is just like it is back in Vegas.  It's 40 miles from here, but it was worth that drive. Pity it's not 24 hours like the ones back in Vegas.  The owner and the workers here are just as friendly and wonderful...I can't rave enough about how much I love the Roberto's chain.

It seems this Roberto's made it to Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive Ins and Dives!  Pity they neglected to tell you the same recipes can be found in the Roberto's that are scattered throughout Las Vegas. I'm not shooting it down, but the food is consistently good throughout all of the Vegas locations.  I have sent several friends and old co-workers here. They've all said it's worth the drive - too bad they don't yelp! They love the super nachos and for some reason, the bean and cheese burrito were huge hits for them. I've had the bean and cheese burrito and it's pretty darn big and delivers on flavor, too. I never thought I'd get overwhelmed by flavor and size in a bean and cheese burrito. It's amazing what you learn about yourself! Haha.  What a pity there isn't a location in Mesa...wait, or maybe that's a good thing for me. :D

I always dread the words from hubby, "Let's go to Fry's."  Why? Is it because he is completely incapable of walking out of that place without having purchased something? Is it because I have a minor heart attack when I get the credit card bill? (We get the air miles, I guess there is some positive outcome from it.)  To me, Fry's is Fry's - we live near the corporate HQ of Fry's Electronics in California and that place is one hot mess. The Fry's on Baseline is a mess, but not a hot mess.  But this Fry's...it's cleverly hidden and if I didn't know any better, it didn't want my husband to find it. I was hoping we wouldn't find it. Like most Fry's Electronics, it has a huge parking lot with the building itself sitting so far back, you could actually miss it. Pity we didn't miss it.  We found what hubby was looking for (something to upgrade our current wireless network in the house to make it go zoom....I thought it went zoom already? No it doesn't, according to hubby.) and walked out having kept the damage to a little over $100.  What I liked about this Fry's is that it's loads cleaner than other Fry's Electronics I've visited. The cafe is actually in the middle of the store (so I could buy a nice cold drink) instead of shoved into the far back corner like it was a naughty child.  I'd come here again...without my husband in tow.

It's a cute place and it's decorated to feel nice and homey. It achieves that. But I'm not there for the ambience, the sandwiches or the drinks - they have Pepsi on tap. SCORE for them. But that's not what I'm here to write about.  The cookies. That's what you come to this place for - the cookies. That's why I'm writing about them, too.  If you bake them, they will come.  When I used to go to the Mesa Arts Center to do work on my jewelry, I'd always have an extra $2 in my pocket for the sugar cookie. I would have one, but it was seriously my crack cocaine. I felt like one was never enough.  I've tasted all their cookies and frankly, they're honorable mentions when you pit them against the good god almighty sugar cookie they make.  Sugar cookie, with that frosting on top...no other cookie out there can compare. It is the one thing that got me hooked on trying to replicate it. I didn't want my husband to know I had spent about $10 a week on cookies since I used to be at the Mesa Arts Center 4-5 days a week.  Eventually, my sugar cookie habit was discovered. An intervention ensued. We won't talk about that. I know it came from a good place by my husband and well meaning friends, but I still harbor a slight bitterness towards them...Since then, hubby's learned to sleep with one eye open.  Ok, putting their sugar cookie addiction aside, I've also had their food. It's nice, but nothing I'd really rave about. It's a little on the pricey side and I'd much rather go around the corner, snarf down some Taco Bell and use the extra money saved towards an extra sugar cookie. :D

This moderately priced place really rocks.  I can't even begin to tell you how happy I get when I think about a potential lunch or dinner there.  Because it's so good, Rosa's is usually packed.  Lunch time is just plain INSANITY!  Groups of parties with with 10-14 seem to be quite the norm.  I've been there consistently for the past 3 months and I've yet to see the restaurant have dirty floors, bathrooms or unfriendly and slow servers.  I've tried just about every dish they have and I would recommend the Flying Saucer or the Chimichanga Plate.  The meats are heavenly -- they are spiced just right, are flavorful and juicy.  The chicken has never been dry in all the times I've eaten there.  Ok, I'm cutting this review short -- I'm heading out to Rosa's.  Hope to see you there!

I have another addiction...In addition to gemstones, silver, gold, copper and my trusty torch, I have another tactile obsession - it's yarn. I am a happy hooker. I like to crochet. I have this disgusting stash of yarn that rivals my gemstones and wire.  As you can see in previous reviews, I got my crack fixes at Lonnie's for my jewelry making addiction. I had yet to find a yarn place in Mesa to fill that void. Until now.  The Fiber Factory is located down the street from Sweet Cakes Cafe (home of the heavenly sweet sugar cookie with fab frosting).  It's a lot bigger than what I was expecting and I have to say - I was very impressed with their yarn selection. I even saw brands that I hadn't seen since I left the UK!   The Fiber Factory even sells things if you're into spinning and weaving as well! It's a huge store. It boasts over 4,000 square feet of yaaarn! I couldn't resist.  Sorry.  I dragged along poor hubby the other day...and as I was fiending over every single skein of yarn in the store, he came over and whispered in my ear, "Honey, look at the crack den in the back!"  Crack den?! In a yarn store?!  I saw what he meant - the gathering of women who were knitting and crocheting. I loved what I saw, but that was way too much estrogen for me.  The prices of yarn in the store cost a bit more than say...Joann's or Michael's, but you get a better variety of bamboo yarn (surprisingly soft!) and other types that you just can't find at the super craft stores.  Parking's a breeze if you follow the directions from their website as they have a private lot behind the store. No worrying about getting towed off of Main Street.  I know where I will go when I want to fiend over things that are not gemstones.

I don't understand how this place got such rave reviews. I really don't.  When hubby and I went, it was some of the worst food and service we've received in a long, long time.  The beer selection was deplorable (by hubby's standards) and the food fell even worse. I think our server knew hubby was going to be fussy because she made sure she was never available. She took our order and literally ran away, only to reappear to put food on the table (an extra star was given because she didn't PLONK or slap it down onto the table) and then...give us our check after we'd been left thirsty. She never asked how food was and was barely civil.  I'll tell you how the food was - forgettable, like the rest of this place.  Will we give this place another chance? Nope. What a pity...I thought this place was so cute when I walked in. Too bad service and food won't entice me back.

I've been here more times than I care to remember...and each time I have never purchased anything. It has a web based business called www.findingking.com  As any jewelery maker out there can tell you, it's hard finding a place where you can establish a good, trustworthy rapport with people who are going to sell you something for the works you will be creating -- this place is NOT it.  Whether I've ordered something online or gone into the store it's always been unfriendly, unhelpful and pissy people working behind the counter. Long before I discovered Phoenix Jewelers Supplies was Finding King, I had ordered a set of metal stamps for my silver smithing...Imagine ordering something in June and finally getting the item in November with Z E R O ZERO nada nothing NO communication whatsoever from them.  I know what it's like to work retail and customer service...I dealt with bitchy women when I worked at the Chanel counter at Nordstrom in my college days...and words cannot describe how truly irate and angry I get when I think that this business is still going...  I guess the old adage from PT Barnum is true -- There's a sucker born every minute.  If you're a jeweler or someone interested in going into metal arts stay far away from this place findingking.com  As any AZ jewelry designer can tell you, stick with Rio Grande and Lonnie's...avoid Phoenix Jewelry Supply at all costs.

Located near Metals Edge Studios, this place has been deceptively hidden from me.  I went there tonight for the first time with some people from a networking group and at first was a bit put off.  It's a bit more bar with the seating style indoors, which was where we chose to sit. There is also outdoor seating with tables and chairs. It was a slow night. We had fast, friendly and efficient service. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating to those who needed different types of seating, etc, because of the really high chairs.  I was expecting crappy bar food and though I was not a fan of the nachos (chicken was a bit bland) or the calamari (tasted like they were frozen...plus, they looked like onions rings at first glance), I was very happy with other items on the menu.  I was a big fan of the complimentary beef taquitos and the chicken fingers that the owner, Flicka, himself sent out....and delivered as well.  The food was priced cheaply and the menu was easy to read. There isn't a huge variety of food to choose from, but there is definitely enough there to satisfy the most finicky eater. Coronas are $2.00, nachos with chicken was a scant $6.75...it was such a bargain!  The owner, Flicka, came and chatted with us a couple of times. At first we wondered who this man was, but he was completely affable and so sincere how could we not enjoy him talking to us?  I enjoyed it here, but it's a bit out of the way. It's really bar more than a cantina. The food is decent and the atmosphere leaves a bit more to be desired. Overall, I'd come here again if someone else were driving.

I hate bringing down a once 4 star review to one star, but it had to be done. If we ever go back, I'll see if it still stays the same.  I went back a couple of weeks ago with my metal arts friends...and I have to say what a difference it was. Literally night and day.  Our server was surly and pissy...the food was just appallingly bad...Flicka was nowhere to be found. Service was slow and it wasn't even busy. A whole...4 tables including ours?  The only remotely good thing about that night, though it's still NOT enough to make me give Flicka's 2 stars, is the checks were all split and correctly done.  Maybe the employees decided to take a break since the owner wasn't there? Whatever it was, we won't be going back.

Edited as of July 16, 2010 to make this a 5 star rating. I did not change anything else in this entry.  So my little car's getting on in years, but I can't part with it because...well, I don't like the bodies of the new benzes. I'll stick to my 2002 until MB makes a body that I like. They're due out for a new one anyway - it's been almost 10 years.  Anyway, I've taken my little car to different MB dealerships for servicing and have never been happy with what I had found and the work they charged.  Back in June I knew I needed to get quite a few things done for the car given her age...and I knew it was going to be cost a very hefty penny. I got quotes from other MB dealerships (Chandler and Phoenix) that made me nearly think about just buying a new car to not have to pay up like that.  Then somehow, my web research pointed me to here...and what an awesome place this is. I flew back into the country and the next day I had them fixing the car. To make things even better, they gave me a free loaner. I didn't have to worry about forking over extra $$ to get a rental.  For people who no longer want to pay dealership prices to maintain your benz, this place is for you. It's professional and they use only genuine MB parts. Additionally, they've lowered their labor rates 11% to help in these economic times!  I know I'll be taking my car back here very soon!

I am going to have to go back and make my previous 4 star review into a 5 star one.  Vivian and her sons at Myers' Star really do blow everyone out of the water. I had taken my car in to Chandler Mercedes because the AC was blowing hot air. After they took my car apart (and charged me close to $300 for it) they gave me a quote to fix my AC for $1100 on top of disassembling my car! So $1400 (not inc tax) to get me through a hot summer.  I said I'd think about it...and made an appointment with Vivian.  $1100 later, I got the same top quality service I may have gotten at the MB dealership, but with one BIG difference - MB said my AC was busted. Vivian's crew said my AC just needed to be SERVICED. I got my spark plugs changed, AC serviced and my service B done as well as some minor repairs for the nice tidy sum of $1137.  The man who worked on my car, Derek, talked me through what was really wrong with my air conditioning. I wasn't talking to a customer service guy. I was talking to the man who actually worked on my car! I liked that.  See the difference? The quality and work is just as good, if not better than any of the MB dealerships.  Forget ever going to the dealership - come to Vivian instead. Not only was everyone friendly and courteous, but they have complimentary loaners providing you have insurance. It's not guaranteed they will always have a loaner, but I've been able to get one the times I've been there. All Vivian asks is that you fill up the tank. All I ask is that you put premium fuel in it if it says so - she's not charging you for the loaner, ok?  This is one local business I feel that is truly exceptional in the area. If you have a MB (or BMW or Audi), come to Myers Star - you will not be disappointed by the service or prices.  What I fully appreciated was in the two times I've brought my car here, there is a detailed list at the end of the invoice with recommendations and pricing of what should be done so you can plan your budget accordingly.  Thank you, Vivian and everyone at Myers' Star Independent MB Service for making my girl happy and purring like the Benz she is.

Hit and miss. I'd have given them 2 stars, but when I went there last week, I wanted to gouge my eyes out with used tampons from sheer frustration...This time was a big, huge MISS.  I hadn't been there in over six months and it slipped my mind that they have the two separate menus -- the non-asian menu (pink) and the asian menu (blue). When the pink menus were dropped on me, I wondered where the chicken chow fun had disappeared to - oh....that's right, I must have appeared as an americanized asian. MY BAD.  I asked for the blue menu and was given a funky look, but it was brought and slapped down on the table with more force than necessary. Was that needed? Really? I thought it was me. Maybe it was. *shrugs*  I honestly thought I'd get a different item on the menu, but noooo...I went for the chicken chow fun.  What a hot mess that was. Not in a good way. It was mega greasy. I mean GREASY like I could've oiled all the squeaky doors I've ever heard in my entire life. There was no flavor. None.  My friend was horrified with her yang chow fried rice. She didn't know what to make of it. I felt bad for recommending it. It was such a let down.  Best chinese food in Mesa/Phoenix? Really? You think so? I don't think so.  I think I'll take my chances with that hideous KFC further down the street than eat here ever again. Hell, I'll go eat at Golden Palace - you know, the place with no windows? - before I'll ever eat at Wong's Place.  Oh...and to add insult to injury, service was so bad (food was slapped down on the table so hard noodles fell off the plate! I only got ONE glass of water as did my friend; they looked at me like I had NO RIGHT using chopsticks when I asked for them, etc) I didn't leave a tip...and the server chased after me as I was getting into my car, demanding tip money. I said no and drove off. I hope he doesn't realize I literally live around the corner from this place...  What drama was had to be all around at Wong's Place.   Maybe I caught them at a wong time. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck...

My cousin and I were talking about metaphysical bookstores (she's really into that kind of stuff) and somehow the topic strayed on to the bookstore she used to love going to when I lived in Vegas - The Psychic Eye. She would literally haunt that place during her stays. Hey - it kept her out of my hair.  ;)  The book part of the store is fairly large despite its exterior. It's also a nice cool place to relax. Yea, they play new age-y kind of music and I tune that out since it normally puts me on edge. I admit to going there for mostly candle holders, room fresheners and incense. I also like the kitsch-y feel to it.  According to my cousin, they've got an excellent selection of books for the solo wicca practitioner. They also have a good deal of books on herbs to choose from.  I loved the smell of the incense that was always burning when I would walk in. It's a nice, pleasant atmosphere and there is absolutely no pretentiousness when you walk in. I like places like that. I'm no practitioner of anything except metal arts. I read my horoscope in the back of mags that's I've pilfered from friends homes...while on the toilet.  TMI?  Sorry.  As a birthday gift several years ago, my friends in Vegas decided to get me a tarot card reading from Abby (she's still there). Abby startled me at first with her big hair and make-up -- very John Waters. I was also a bit puzzled when she took me to a backroom and the only thought going through my head was, "NO SECOND LOCATION!!!" as I plotted a way to fight her off if I had to. Nope, I didn't have to worry about such a thing.  I thought going to a backroom away from the crowd of the bookstore was a nice, private way to have your cards read.  Since then, when I go to bookstores such as this with my cousin, I look for that kind of privacy, but I haven't found it here in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Mesa. Your business and readings are there for all to listen. In many ways, I'm a private person and I certainly don't want people listening in on my readings.  Ah, if only the Psychic Eye would open here in the Phoenix area...

Please overlook the very scary decor, frightneningly stained carpet and tiki hut furniture.  This place houses the best hush puppies I've ever had in my entire life. If you're a native or have lived in Vegas long enough and have been coming to the establishment, you can ask for their jalapeno hush puppies. It's one of those quirky things that some people would know just from living in Las Vegas -- kind of like when you want water you ask for a Lake Mead cocktail. The hush puppies are served with the best honey butter I've ever tasted.  It's blended just right - enough honey mixed in with the butter so it just soaks into your hush puppy and makes a wonderful sinful bite of greasified heaven...yum.  On Monday nights this place has all you can eat crab leg nights.  When we lived in Vegas, our friends and I lived for Monday nights. It's the kind of all you can eat crab leg night where you know you have to take off your rings and watch so you don't get 'em all soppy and soaky from the wonderfully freshly steamed crab legs.  I've also eaten their catfish - what a treat that was.  Now when hubby and I go back to visit friends, we always make sure to stay until Tuesday so we can enjoy all you can eat crab legs.

I still maintain that my husband and I were the youngest ones there when we went to visit. Why did we choose the Suncoast and not somewhere on the strip? Because we used to live in Vegas and we avoid the strip like the plague. Plus, we weren't there to gamble. We were there to re-assess Vegas and see if it's a place we would want to move to again. (no)  When we lived in Vegas we were about 10-15 minutes away from the Suncoast. The Suncoast is also where I spent the day with my friends when 9/11 hit. I still remember sitting at the bar with other locals, staring at the tv, tears streaming down my face. I was supposed to have gone to see a movie with friends, but all we could do was sit at the bar and watch the news.  That said, I was so surprised at the rooms here. Goodness what a great place. I was expecting a bit of a seedy locals casino. No, not at all. It was incredibly cheap for the 2 nights we stayed.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in Summerlin and avoid the strip.

YIKES! I demoted them to 2 stars. Why?!  The food, plain and simple. It really isn't Rosa's on University. I had been running errands all day last Saturday and I ended up at Bark Avenue Pet Supply, right next door to Tia Rosa's.  I remembered thinking it was ok the last time so I thought, why not? I couldn't afford to be picky as my cousin and I were having a bad low blood sugar moment...I knew it was bad because I started to have the shakes -- anyway...sorry...I am digressing.  There weren't that many people there, so that was a good thing. Service was wonderful. The chips and salsa revived us, as did the iced tea.  I decided to splurge and get the chimichanga instead of the salad I would have normally ordered. BIIIG mistake. One of the things I liked about Rosa's on University is that their chicken chimichangas are flavorful - the chicken is always spiced right and it's never dry.  I truly wish I could have said the same about this one. I was so angry with it that I ended up just yanking the chicken out (they put beans inside the chimichanga instead of it being straight chicken -- yuck) and eating the deep fried shell. The salad on the plate was going bad - it was brown and slimey.  My cousin wasn't thrilled with her burrito and the refried beans in general just had zero flavor. I can't believe that these 2 restaurants are the same ones operating off the exact recipes. Tia Rosa's has gone dreadfully wrong somewhere and I can't quite put my finger on it.  The atmosphere is still cute and the bathrooms are always wonderfully clean, but the food...the food...PISSES ME OFF. IF I PAY THAT MUCH FOR IT I EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD.  The appearance of the place forces me to give it 2 stars because it really is adorable. Now if only the food had some flavor and consistency from the original Rosa's on University.  I refuse to go back there -- even if someone else is paying.

While I do love the food at O'Asian the service has fallen a great deal.  Their sushi prices are not as competitive as compared to the sushi restaurant just down the road on Val Vista.  We've been there at least 2 times a week in the past year and watching them rotate their staff has been exhausting.  Last week was the absolute last straw for bad service.  Maybe they will improve, but for now, I know I won't go back.  Service aside, the food is great, but getting cold food after waiting for 25 mintues?  Again, it points back to service.  The owner's a cool guy, but too bad the rest of his staff is not.  I wondered why so many of our co-workers stopped going to O'Asian - it's the service.  I am sure I can find chicken chow fun elsewhere in the valley.

Everytime we've been to Roy's, whether it was in Honolulu, Las Vegas, Chicago, San Francisco or here, we've never been disappointed.  Yea, it's a chain.  Sue me.  One of the best things about this chain is the consistency in the high excellence of food and service.  We love Roy's, we've been going here for a long time.  I would recommend it just about anyone, even the fussy eaters.  If you are a chocolate lover, make sure to try their chocolate lava cake.  You have to order it along with your dinner as it takes about 30 minutes to make.

This buffet is located on Gilbert Road across the street from Mi Amigo's and Carl's Jr.  It's got a varied enough selection and is yummy for the price.  It's clean, well stocked, child friendly and spacious.  I've never had to wait for a table at peak lunch or dinner time hours.  Hubby likes it quite a bit.  Everyone is friendly and the food is almost always fresh, even during off peak eating times.  Getting drinks are a breeze thanks to an attentive wait staff.  If you're looking for fast, quick, easy eats in a Chinese food category, this one's for you!

I love Black Bear Diner.  Best big breakfast ever.  I am a huge breakfast fan and am incredibly fussy about quality, size and flavor.  This place always has it.  I love their thick cut bacon and yumalicious hash browns.  I've also eaten their salads, sandwiches and almost everything else on their menu.  I would recommend almost all of it.  Black Bear Diner used to be a small chain with only 5 restaurants stretching through California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon.  Now there are 15+ and it's made its way here to Arizona.  Some people don't like chains, but this chain is consistently good.  I've eaten at the locations in WA, OR, CA and NV -- always the same taste, quality and quantity each time.  It's casual and family friendly.  Parking is usually a lot, but on the rare occasion, street parking is mostly recommended.  I find it's usually connected to a hotel/motel.  Don't let that deter from the yumminess within.  :)  It's quite a drive from here in Mesa, but worth it.

On my way to the airport I wanted something fast that wasn't McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Del Taco, Carl's Jr or Jack In The Box.  OH LOOK! KFC across the street. I always said I wanted to try it. Mostly because I haven't had KFC in a long, long time. I think the KFC I ate in India didn't count, because it was in another country...anyway, I digress.  Whatever you do, don't go. Please, don't go. I took a verrrry big hit for the Mesa/PHX yelpers in going here. I'm surprised I didn't get food poisoning. The place is disgustingly filthy. The tables were sticky and from a distance they all looked clean until you sat down. I wanted to cry. I really did. It's such a huge contrast to the other fast food restaurant I went to.  Booths were unstable as was the clientele. I felt really overdressed in my grubby jeans and grubby shirt.  The cashier and the servers were friendly and nice...I think they realized I was the only customer that wasn't high on something. I was truly disturbed by some of their patrons - they were walking adverts for "DON'T DO DRUGS".  I think this KFC/A&W really killed any and all future KFC cravings. I said that this place wasn't good for kids - mostly because I'm worried they'll catch next year's strain of the flu - yup, if you want to get your immune system up, come here.   Ok, going to go shower now that I remember what this place was like. *shudders*

In one short day I needed so many things mailed out and faxed - and this place really accommodated me and my list. All smiles, no complaints...  Best thing? Everything was done perfectly! Faxes arrived where they should have as did the packages. WOO HOO!!!  No one rolled their eyes when they saw me coming with the boxes. I have been known to cause a small amount of fear and trepidation in establishments like this because everything that goes out has to be precise.  Two thumbs up!

A neighbor down the street described this one as The Ghetto target.  I lived in India and I know what ghetto is and honey, this Target is not ghetto. It's actually better than the Target just down the street from me. This Target takes an extra *gasp* ten minutes to get to.  I went there Thursday after landing back in good ole AZ. Because it's Target, it's organized like the other Targets...so finding cleaning supplies, etc was no problem.  I have a love/hate relationship with Target. I can never seem to leave without spending under $100. I went armed with a list this time...  I wandered down the clothing section because I rarely buy clothing from Target. I just never see anything worth buying...until I set my eyes on these Mossimo sweaters that were on sale for only $15. I got 2 in black, then green, purple and brown...my eyes happened to fall on this ADORABLE green fall coat. Somehow, it fell into my basket.  I bought more clothing than cleaning supplies. Good thing I didn't wander down the shoe aisle, because I've seen some seriously cute shoes at Target before.  I like this Target because even though it's in "the ghetto", it's really not. It's got a good selection and a friendly staff - what more can anyone ask for? Well, you can ask for a Starbucks. Sadly, I don't recall seeing a Starbucks there.

I took my little car here because I've gone through 2 antennae losses while taking my car to other car washes...and replacing my antenna is NOT cheap.  I searched for hand car washes in my area...and came up with this place. I do like it a lot. The only thing that makes me dock it a star is the fact that they advertised a car wash for $17.99 but was charged $18.00 on my card. I asked the guy and he said, "It's 18." Then they need to state that. It's a difference of a penny, but I know for some people it really is something they will fight you over. I won't, but I think it's a bit of false advertising.  Had to get that out there in case anyone decides to ever come here.  I do like car wash -- absolutely ZERO auto car wash thing where they rinse and then wipe down, claiming it to be all hand washing. Nope, not this place.  They actually washed the car down with a hose and everything was done...by hand! They actually lived up to the hype!  WOOT!  So when I got the car back, I nearly wept...it was so beautiful...almost as if I had first purchased the car -- minus the dings on the door thanks to inconsiderate people who just park too close to me and fling their car door open (what's up with that, btw?).  I'd recommend this place, but if the price says $9.99/$17.99/$34.99 and they charge you 10/18/35, make sure to speak up and let them know it's not cool (if you feel it isn't).  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.

This small surprise of a find really made me happy. Originally I had gone to the shopping complex for Euro Cafe...it is closed and it looks like there is a frame store in its place.  It is located on the northeast corner of Longmore and Southern directly behind McDonald's and right next to Life Uniform.  BTW -- What is it with strip malls with strip malls behind the strip mall? Also, what's up with the inability to properly NUMBER a freaking building? The numbers here are hidden so well, you practically have to run into the building with your car...even though it won't actually guarantee that you will find the number.  URGH  Anyway, I digress...sorry! For a scant $10 I was surprised to get a 12 inch philly cheesesteak with fries and a drink.  The meat was lovely and not mega greasy like some other Philly Cheesesteak places. The cheese also wasn't added on top as an afterthought, either. They had taken the time to actually blend it with the meat, onions and mushrooms -- heavenly! The result is something that doesn't stretch for miles on end after you take a bite, only to sloppily land on your shirt or even worse, drop food onto your lap or plate. The fries were not dipped in salt like Two Hippies. They serve Coke products -- boo, hiss!  The owner (or I am assuming he is the owner) and I were talking about Euro Cafe...He said it's been closed for over a year. He said I should try the Gyro next time...and I will.  Decor is scant, but functional...and it is wonderfully clean. You won't feel like you've stumbled into the kind of place that will make you feel sick after the first bite - I loved it here.  I really hope this place does well. I have my reservations because of where it is located - behind two fast food restaurants and a strip mall that's about 20% empty. I wouldn't have found this place if I hadn't pulled over to google Euro Cafe on my phone.

I really wanted to give these guys 5 stars, but it's the price of things that made me go, "no, I can't."  I've been dragged to many Weinerschnitzels in my lifetime because my friends have hot dog cravings and this one was IMPECCABLY clean. I mean, I wasn't scared. The floors were spotless, the tables gleamed, even the serving counter was immaculate. The place where food was put behind the counter was something my anal retentive self fell in love with - it was all sparkly clean, napkins piled neatly and in an orderly fashion. I nearly fainted.  I even commented on it and the guy behind the counter said, "We want to have our customers see a clean place. Not a dirty one."  Much love as I do have for the cleanliness, I think they made up for it in price. No deals, nothing. I'm used to seeing a dollar menu-ish type of thing. The ones in California have them and I should know because I see the promos for them on TV here in California.  I was surprised to see that a chili dog combo (2 chili dogs, medium fries and drink) was $5.99.  I should've persuaded my friends to hit costco and gotten the hot dog, drink AND an ice cream for a little over $3.  Nice clean place, but dirty high prices for a fast food joint.

$13 for a bland, large cheesesteak. $13 for a bland, large cheesesteak with 5 pieces of mushrooms that we paid extra for. $13 for a bland, large cheesesteak that we ordered with fries -- we got about 10 pieces for that $3.  Absolute and utter rip off. Semi-friendly cashier who seemed hell bent on rushing us through our order even though there was NO ONE BEHIND US.  N O .  N E V E R  E V E R  again. EVER.  If I could give this place zero stars and burn it down in the process, I would. It was shiteous. Absolutely shiteous.  Am I making myself clear? I think I am.

Ay naku - Santo Nino...where are you? This place needs your help.  I swear I will do an eternity of novenas just so they can get rid of the grease on their food.  I was there several days ago and ordered their pork adobo. For the first time in my entire life I cringed over pork adobo. Me, cringing over pork adobo? what what what?!  The layer of grease on it was...wow. For me to say it was so greasy I couldn't eat it is really saying something. I swear, even their plain rice  had a greasy feeling in my mouth. The flavor of everything was wonderful, but uggh...the grease. THE GREASE!!!  I want to go back. I really do. But the grease stops me everytime.

I don't know how to drill it into my friends that I've met here in Arizona...PEI WEI AND PF CHANG'S IS  N O T AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD.  I've gone here 4 times, each with different friends and *gasp* my husband. This is the one place where he and I don't see eye to eye on. I told him after my last time there if he wants to go, he will have to find friends to go with. I'll be anywhere but there.  I've had their pad thai with chicken, fried rice with shrimp, ginger broccoli and asian coconut curry...each time I've been massively disappointed.  With their pad thai, there was an over abundane of sauce that should not be soaking into my food. It was extremely bitter and a bit sour as well. The chicken had been overdone.  yuck.  Their fried rice with shrimp was ok, even though I had specifically asked that no scallions and no peppers be put in (peppers in my friend rice?  WTF?!). It was bogged down with far too much soy sauce for my liking. Like they had literally soaked it over night in soy sauce. I could manage to eat half of it before the soy sauce made me stop.  The other dishes were passable, but again, I won't be going back here voluntarily. I think I'd rather eat at California Pizza Kitchen before ever setting foot in here again...actually, I think I may actually go to Rumbi's before Pei Wei.  The atmosphere wasn't so bad, but it was loud. The open kitchen and hearing all the clattering of plates can get to you after a while. Mercifully the times I've been there were no screaming children, but I've heard horror stories from some friends that go there on a regular basis. I've been lucky.  I just could never get a feel for the place - I never bonded with it. Maybe because it just never felt like fully authentic Chinese food.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but this place is way off for me.

I'm really picky about where I get my car washed. I've been to this place a handful of times because I used to live near it.  I go here only when I'm on this side of town. When it first opened a little over a year ago, it was wonderful. On days when it's busy, the level and dedication of cleaning the car falls. On others when it's somewhat slow the job that is done is wonderful. It's hit and miss.  What is always going on are the guys who want to do the windshield repair? I hate it. They just won't let up. They're really aggressive. I tried to ignore one of them (and this made it my last visit ever) and he literally yelled, "HEY YOU - I AM TALKING TO YOU. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?!" It's the same pushy guy that I always see. You'd think he'd remember me by now because each time he's asked me, I've told him that I'm getting the windshield replaced next week. I looked at mister yelling at me and said, "I will answer you when I'm done with this man. No need to yell."  The extremely nice man who was helping me decide on what I should get done on my car had the decency and grace to look embarrassed at the antics of the windshield repair man. I also told the man that I will not be returning because of the windshield guy.  Overall, I just felt so uncomfortable at the approach of the windshield repair person that I can't even bring myself to recommend this place to anyone.  The car wash is good, but the windshield repairman just spoiled a good business. Too bad the Classic Car Spa people don't really care.

I hate you. Really hate you. I hate you even more because I have to pass by you every day to get to the grocery store.  I hate you so much I make sure to flip you off everytime I pass by you.  I hate you because I love mexican food and instead of you being Rosa's you're Macayo's.  Why can't you be more like Rosa's? Why do you have to so close to me? Why must your fugly parrot be so obnoxiously bright at night, a welcoming beacon of mexican food for unsuspecting first timers?  You lured me in. Made me think you could have been authentic; the real thing.  You're not.  Dross. That's what you are. Dross...yet people still like going to you.  May you burn in hell for trying to pass off that slop that I ordered as a chimichanga.  I hate you.  PS No, I'm not kidding - I really hate you.

Of all the places to put a restaurant in...it's like wedged in a complex that houses doctors! Parking's crap because everyone in Vegas drives huge things like Hummers and try to park (unsuccessfully) in a spot meant for a compact car from the 80s. What happens is the assholes in the Hummers end up taking 2 spots.  Here's some advice -- if you can't drive the damn thing, don't buy it, ok? If after 2 years you still can't park it with deference to other people, sell it, ok?  What I love about Bagel Cafe is their matzoh ball soup. Best goddamn matzoh ball soup I've ever had. EVAR.  EVAR!  I'm also a huge fan of their breakfasts, but I go there for their bagels (I have wet dreams about their onion bagels) and matzoh ball soup. When you order their matzoh ball soup, it comes with a bagel - how else do you think I got a crush on a bagel?!  It can get crowded and hectic and *very* loud...but worth it when they place that bowl of matzoh ball goodness in front of you. It's like I'm meeting the love of my life the first time -- everything around me dims and all I can see before me is a yummy toasted onion bagel and a bowl of orgasmic goodness waiting for me...  Desserts from here are ok - they're not very sweet, but they will hit the spot. Out of all their desserts, I find I like their macaroons the best.

My most recent visit has made me have to dock a star...the service wasn't up to par and neither was the food. I don't think it's gone down in quality, but I think we just caught the place on a bad day.   My bagel and cream cheese was still delicious, though!  Note to self: I'm there for the matzoh ball soup or pastrami sandwich. Anything else is a huge mistake. They drown their salads in dressing - make sure to ask for it on the side.

This place was better when it was Desert Passageway.  Had to use the bathroom, but they were closed for cleaning. The family bathrooms a few steps away were not. So I used them. Finished up. Put soap on my hands and went to the sink - water was not working.  Came out with soap on my hands and asked if I could just wash my hands in the bathroom. Surly mexican woman with a walkie talkie said no. I went, "I have soap on my hands. The least you can do is get me a paper towel from inside since you won't let me in." She rolled her eyes and complied...i waited for a minute and I could hear her talking behind the door with the others. Meanwhile I'm left standing there with soap on my hands and other women who desperately needed to pee.  She took so long I ducked into the men's bathroom and freaked them out. I said, "You all have something I've seen before, but since the cleaning crew is taking forever and won't let me into the women's bathroom to wash the soap off my hands, I had to come in here...sorry!" In the time it took me to say that I was able to rinse the soap off my hands, actually wipe them on paper towels and then run out...making them wonder if they had really seen me at all...I'm fast like that.  Bathroom criticism aside, this isn't what I'd consider higher end stores - this is like going to your regular everyday mall where you'd find a Hot Topic, Chico's and, well...you get my drift. Everyday shops you can find in everyday life all over the US.  While there was a Sephora there, it still can't induce me into giving it more than one star after that bathroom disaster.  By the way, it's not really a mile of shopping...it's just making you walk around in a loop twice so it equals a mile.

I ate here once w hubby after we wandered around Whole Foods next door...I was starting to get cranky and nasty. Hubby knew it was time for me to be fed.  I was hungry and completely demolished my plate. I don't even remember what I ordered. It was rumored to be brisket, but I was so hungry I didn't check twice. I left with a happy belly. Food tasted good, but the overall impression of the place was, "It's not that big, it's clean enough and the portions were pretty big."  I became a fan, but hubby said his food wasn't so good and had no desire to come back and give them a second chance. Boo. :( Pity because we live so close to them.

I gave it one star because its only saving grace is that the kitchen is open late...and it serves Pepsi.  I ordered (so typical of me) their supersomethinggooey chimichanga. You may as well have brought me a pile of flaming poo. It looked so unappetizing when it was plunked down in front of me. You know when you were a kid and you were forced to eat something you hated and you did all you could to prolong the agony? Well, there were no potted plants within range for me to dump my food in and the napkins were so flimsy I couldn't spit my bites out gracefully. Instead, I pushed away the food and claimed, "I savored every bite and now I'm full.  I'll take it home." My friend loves that place. Why? I can't understand it, either. I dumped the leftovers off in the trash at the Taco Bell I ended up at.  Service was crap, food was crap, parking was crap. It's located around the corner from my husband's old office...but hell, if the die hard alkies of my husband's office wouldn't go there, that's saying something. Geez, it's stumbling or in their case, tumbling, distance from work. Even happy hour couldn't persuade the guys to go.  Yes, it's that bad. You know it's bad when the alcoholics say no.  Thank god it's all you can drink Pepsi or I wouldn't know what to do with myself. *rolls eyes* I know what I'd do - I'd go to Jack in the Box across the street and bring it over because JITB is better than whatever Dos Gringos could ever try to feed me.  PS -- What's up with those park benches for tables?

I used to think this was a solid 3 star place. But not anymore.  I've left the Valley officially as of last week and was sad to go. Before I left, I made it a goal to eat at my favorite places, with Chompie's being one of them.  I hadn't been back to any of the Chompie's since Adam Richman had made a stop, but the last time I was there was back in January...and I really don't recall the prices being as exorbitant as they were last week. I know they weren't.  Price gouging aside, the past few times I've been the service has been really...bad. I'm saying bad because I don't feel like swearing, but let's say excrement-y, ok?  I arrived with a friend in tow - we were hungry. The hostess seated us promptly and was very friendly. A guy brought water by...and we sat. For ten minutes. Ten minutes. We made eye contact with 2 servers. No one came by to take our orders.  We ended up leaving. What a pity. I was willing to blow money there for some sliders, too.  Since they didn't want our business, Crackers and Co took it....plus, I saved a few dollars and actually had someone taking my order in under 10 minutes...with a smile.

Maybe I had a bad experience here because I don't understand why previous yelpers found this place to be noteworthy. It was loud - I guess it doesn't help to be literally surrounded by screaming infants with their mothers who lunch...and let their 2-4 year olds run around.  I just didn't know what to say...but I think the canned chicken in my jamaican jerk caesar says it all. Canned chicken?! If it was grilled, it could have fooled me. I've had canned chicken once in my life and that was when we went camping. I will never forget the taste or the texture...and I found it sitting on my salad. Yuck.  Hubby had the Luau Pork rice bowl. I could tell by the look on his face he wasn't too thrilled with it. Further evidence was him pushing his food away after ten minutes of attempting to eat it.  I guess I expect too much when restaurants claim it's Island food. My father is a complete island boy, right out of Kauai and I've been fortunate enough to have lived on the islands while growing up and baby, this place is truly a repulsive rip off.

To work in Sephora is hell. It's retail. It's make-up. You have to deal with women who you would swear were raised in a barn by chickens and pigs, because of their attitudes and lack of manners. It is evidenced by the need to peck another woman down then throw her in the mud. Yea, I saw several women like that in this store in the 30 minutes I was there.  Yes, I encountered an extremely surly older than me woman (she had to have been at least 50) who was working there.  Yes, I found what I was looking for. Yes, I spent a little over $150. Yes, I was happy.  Yes, I encountered the store manager whose name begins with a D. She had a big happy smile that wasn't forced. She had beautiful hair! She asked how my shopping was going. She asked if I needed help. I was fine...I had all I needed.  Check out was a breeze and even the cashier was super smily and helpful. Out of all the Sephoras I've hit, this and the one in Caesar's are my absolute FAVORITES.

Had a craving for nachos earlier and thought I'd give this place a try. I ate here once before when we had moved to this area 4 years ago...and I thought it was ok, but it was something I forgot to Yelp about.  This time I remembered to Yelp.  I'm going against the grain here (surprise) and am going to say it wasn't all that. The other time I came here it wasn't all that either.  The carne asada on the super nachos was bland. The guac? Bland. The refried beans? I never knew they were refried beans until I looked at them.  I can't believe I'm going to say this...but I think I prefer any of the 'berto's over this place.  Yea, I went there.  The place was clean, the girl who took my order was friendly and the guy who gave me my food was friendly as well. Parking lot could do with a good sweeping and someone could pick up all the debris that's out there.  I'll keep looking for a better place to eat.

I noticed the reviews here were mixed...you either love it or hate it. I had passed this place long before Guy ever showed up and was pretty impressed with their menu. I just never had the chance to eat here because I'm either here in AZ or somewhere else.  Luckily, I was here in AZ and finally got to experience it. Went with a friend and we split the fried calamari and the Italian stallion between us. I had the chicken caesar salad and she had the spinach salad.  First off, hats off to them getting the calamari right - it wasn't over done and rubbery. WOO HOO! Lovely delicate blend of spices and a lovely batter that just left me completely satisfied.  Salads arrived as we were finishing up the calamari and the salads cost about 8 or 9 a plate and were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that if you're charging that much for a salad, be a little more generous with the greens, ok? I love my salads and I was a bit bummed that there wasn't enough green on my plate.   Finally...that pizza...The Italian Stallion...holy mother of...oh baby. LOVED the dough. Loved the whole pizza. LOVE LOVE LOVED the fact that the sausage had a surprise kick of spice. It was gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.  Our server kept the table stocked well with water - another bonus. She was attentive without being overly obnoxious and we never had to worry or wait for things. YAY!  Overall, what a wonderful experience...I definitely would come back and I can't wait to go back, too.

There is no better way to do it - eat while walking. You are burning calories AND you also get to sample some seriously good good food.  It's only at the Tempe Arts Festival do I go stupid crazy for flavored popcorn and...much to hubby's horror, I've been known to drop down some serious cash from my favorite soap vendor. Hey, a girl's gotta make that stuff last until the next one!  The Festival is held twice a year - April and December.  This one that I went to today was incredibly more mellow and not as packed as the other ones. I was very surprised. Face painting for the kids, food while I walk, cool things to keep me occupied as well as forcing me to walk more...what more can I ask for?  Parking this year was a *breeze*. My friend and I bit the bullet and we forked over $10 for parking that was across the street from Mill Ave. So worth it. Most big events charge $20 for parking. I felt like I was getting a discount!  If you've never been to the Tempe Arts Festival, give it a go. It's worth the time and you will have lots of fun.

I knew there was a reason why I called this place Whole Paycheck. I had inadvertently coined that when one had opened down the street back in Vegas. I was absolutely gobsmacked at the prices...but they carried the higher end things I used for baking so I didn't complain (too much), but hubby sure did make up for it.  So now I know why stuff is so pricey - just go to this place. I was here back in December (and forgot to yelp about it...bite me!) and I nearly fainted at the sheer size of this place -- and the man at the tapas bar in the back said I had to come back for the wine tasting that weekend.  Seriously? Wine tasting? A tapas bar? Pasta bar? BBQ place smack dab in the middle of the food? I went into sensory overload. Bright lights, music, kids screaming everywhere, and food samples. I was having costco flashbacks. In a bad way.  I actually had to walk out for a few mins. I shouldn't have come here on my own. I needed someone to cling to because I have never been this overwhelmed in my entire life...ok, I have been, but that was in a different country and in an entirely different situation. Anyway, I ended up running (literally) into a friend who was checking out the place...and my co-dependent butt had a friend to cling to. In the end, she was clinging to me because she was far more overwhelmed than I was.  It didn't help that I was hungry so I ended up at the sushi bar there...it was a little pricey for my taste, but sweet jebus...that sushi was good. *SO* good I had some made for my dinner later on that night.  I ended up purchasing some grapeseed oil so I could make my own sugar scrub. I was having issues with forking out so much for grapeseed oil in places like Safeway where, for 8 oz, it cost $7.99. I got 24 oz for $10. Not gonna complain about that! I also bought some charcoal as I was having a craving for BBQ...and this was one Whole Foods where there was NO attitude. Nor pissy cashier, no snarling workers. They got me!  Whole Paycheck...takes your whole paycheck and builds places like this....and you can be thankful (or angry, depends on the type of person you are) they made good use of your money.

They've added new things to their menu and now I'm an even bigger fan of them. My only complaint is that their servings are huge - they say it feeds one person, claiming it's a single serving. Yea, it's a single serving -- for TWO people.  I'm currently loving their new selection of pastas and sauces. They've added in chicken masala in their prepackaged meals. I still find their butter chicken a bit on the bland to flavorless side. How I wish they would bring their chicken tikka masala from the UK.  The one that prevents me from giving them 5 stars is the nature of their dishes with rice - there is usually more rice than say, chili, as an example. I end up wasting food and I can't stand doing that. They are always generous with the rice but never the main part of the dish. I'd like more mango chicken with my rice, plzkthx! Are you listening F&E?  I'm not too fond of their chicken or carne asada burritos. I don't know if it's the spicing, but for me it seems a bit off - and they tend to contain too much rice and beans for me. Maybe if someone tries their burritos, they can tell me.  Their desserts are decent, but again, they're not single serve items. They are far too big for it. I eat a "single serving" of tres leches cake in 4 days.  I do find bargains in the fruit that's about to expire. I feel that paying $3+ for pre-cut fruit in a small-ish plastic container a bit much. I go on the day/day before that the fruit is to expire and purchase it for $1.40 - the cheapest I scored it for was $.75 and it lasted 5 days past the due date. Sorry, leftover college day moments there.  DOH. Plus, I'm lazy as all f*ck about cutting up my own fruit.  I'll be updating as F&E starts unveling new products for me to taste.

My little ball of fluffy love is one of the best things in my life.  I was looking to change his dog food because I had been worried about his allergies and his lack of zeal during feeding time. He eats anything, but he hated his food. I always noticed he was prone to sneezing and wheezing after eating.  I researched high quality dog food on the net and found what I was looking for...I followed links that took me to Bark Avenue Pet Supply.  What a wonderful group of people! They were extremely helpful and extremely knowledgeable about their products...even going so far as to explaining why some of the food is better than others. I stuck to my original plan of trying Orijen for my dog.  I also decided to purchase a small fluffy toy for Rex (the dog!). The sales person claimed  it was "indestructible". Two weeks later, that toy is looking a little worse for wear, but it's still going strong...so is my little bundle of love - he's no longer sneezing and wheezing after he eats and he relishes every bite of kibble.  They also have a good selection for cats, too.  If you're looking for a place that rivals Petco or Petsmart for your doggy and kitty needs, this place is it.

The original review, written below, got yanked after 2+ years being here on yelp because of vulgar language...here it is, in its glory, without the C bomb being dropped.  ********************************  I am not sure what happened, but somewhere around December things were getting sloppy here at Bark Avenue. I figured it was the holidays and my last trip there wasn't very pleasant - the snotty cashier who glared at me when I walked in should've been an indicator.  She looked at my credit card and ID and said it should match. That is an ongoing battle with Wells Fargo for the past ten years, btw - they haven't been very good at issuing me a new card with my married name. Nevermind that my AZ DL has my maiden name as my middle name with my new last name, so you can clearly see the that I am the person, anyway, I digress. I told her that it's been a battle with Wells Fargo.  The cashier merely looked down at me and said, "Next time I may not permit you to buy anything from here."  *insert record scratching noise here and hit the rewind button*  The cashier merely looked down at me and said, "Next time I may not permit you to buy anything from here."  Ok, I did hear correctly and you did read correctly, too.  WHUUUUUUUT?!  Again.  WHUUUUUUUT?! Whuut?!  Ok, maybe holiday shoppers and family life is stressing her out, so I cut her some slack.  Friends who have gone there on my recommendation have found service to be downright rude and obnoxious.  I went back there last month - I've been meaning to write a review, but have been stalling - and the cranky woman's partner in crime was there. The same condescending woman from December rang up my purchases, didn't even look at me, nothing. Kept talking to her friend. I paid in cash this time...not even a thank you. No acknowledgement, nothing.  Calling it like I see it - Bark Avenue is overpriced and frankly, I don't want to have to pay for poopy butt snobby, horribly DEPLORABLE AND REPUGNANT customer service.  Avoid Bark Avenue. I'll drive to Scottsdale or Phoenix or order my dog's food off the internet.  It's not worth the hassle. Avoid Bark Avenue. They think they're better than the others...and they're not.  I had always been a staunch supporter of local businesses, but this is one local business who lost my support.

There is one reason why I go here and one one reason only -- breakfast.  I love that I can get breakfast anytime of the day here.  I always get greedy and order a #4 and end up taking the rest home.  I have been known to deviate from my normal breakfast loving self and order their sandwiches and salads...all are out of this world in terms of proportion.  So much food for such a reasonable price!  Now I no longer have to drive all the way to Phoenix...this one is just down the street!

I passed this place on my way home today...and forgot I had eaten there when hubby and I first moved to this area of Mesa.  I remembered I never wrote about it on yelp. Hah! Good thing I remembered to now.  It was all right. They seemed to be out of practically anything we asked about..right down to the french fries. I didn't know what to make of it.  Portions were ok. Hubby got the jambalaya. Not good. I'm surprised they've managed to stay open. It's been so dead when I've passed - lunch, dinner and late into the night.  There is something about that place that lacks in originality and flavor. I'm not a big fan of Creole food, but I kept thinking that this wasn't the place to get an authentic plate of it.  I'd pass and find another seafood restaurant...I know there's a Red Lobster on Alma School. Yea, I went there and threw Cajun Seafood Corner under the bus. They deserved it.

So far, so good! The Lowe's here in the valley I've been hitting in different locations all seem to be doing the right thing. Even though it's New Year's Eve, we purchased a hot water heater since ours decided to relieve itself all over our garage floor - how rude!  So easy as 1-2-3, we went to this Lowe's because somehow hubby found it (please don't ask, I was too busy cursing at the water heater in the garage), we drove over and in under 20 minutes, we had been set up with an appointment to have the water heater installed on a Saturday and had paid in under 20 minutes. O RLY? YA RLY!  I was happy, he was happy...and our garage will thank us for getting rid of the old bessie water heater that decided to die an ungraceful death in our home.

Aww yea, baby! By far my second favorite Costco (my first favorite one is in Honolulu and only because I can get Macadamia nut Hershey's Kisses!).  This has a gas station and...though my digestive tract hates me for it, a kick ass cheese selection. The Costco back in the 408/415 doesn't hold a candle to this Costco in cheese selection.  I avoid any costco during their demo hours because frankly, I have zero desire to be shoved aside by hungry little mothers with their monster kids. I detest trying to maneuver around people randomly stopping to chat to the demo person and having their cart blocking off an aisle. Have some consideration, ok? Not all of us are there to eat!  The best perk to this Costco? It's less than 10 minutes from my house. WOO HOO!  Bummer they don't take other credit cards because I would love to get flight miles, but it's ok...I was persuaded to finally get an Amex and now I get back some rockin' rewards!

In the Valley, this is by far my husband's favorite BBQ place. We discovered it purely by accident on our way to Bavarian Point, a German restaurant (I'll write about that later).  It's a cute, gimmicky place, but not where I want to have BBQ.  I think BBQ is ok, but it's really not my thing.  It's my husband's thing.   I usually get the beef brisket. He usually gets the St. Louis Spareribs.  The beef bristket is good enough to keep me happy and complaint free. I love the jalapeno cornbread that's served before the meal.  I love that their sides are all you can eat - imagine bottomless fries and onion rings.  One small problem - for some reason, each time we've gone there (about 10 times) I've yet to get my french fries super hot...like right out of the grease, burn my lip but keep on eating goodness. It's always tepid, always lukewarm...so I usually tend to not eat all my fries.  Other than that, it's good. It can get loud, but service is friendly. You can't ask for more - good bbq and a friendly waitstaff that is efficient.

Yup, yup...still a fan. Service is still good, but they've definitely improved on my french fry complaint - my fries were hot and burned my mouth. WOO HOO! :)  Everything was as good as I remembered it. I docked a star because part of my brisket was really tough so I didn't eat that part...it has become a reward for my cute little dog Rex. :)  Still 2 thumbs up from me and hubby.

You were open...one day you were closed.  Two years later I drive past you and see a line.  In vain I thought it was for people heading to Red Robin, PF Chang's or BJ's next to you.  But no, I saw your HOT FRESH DONUTS lights, calling to me from 2 lanes over in traffic. I decided to drive like a typical Arizona driver -- I cut people off and swerved into the parking log, taking the first spot I could find. I had to move. It was a handicap spot. I was sorely tempted to get out and limp...  I'm glad I didn't go through the drive thru -- what a line! But inside...what a line!  It seems people can't get enough of the goodness within and who can blame them?  They don't have apple fritters.  BOO! The one in Mountain View did.  I got their original glaze. There was quite a line so I had to stand there and watch as the donuts came out of the oil, flipped over and then went through the sugar bath waterfall...very mesmerizing.  I'm so embarrassed. I'm sure the last thing people wanted to see was me shoving a hot donut in my mouth as they were waiting for my parking spot. I licked my fingers with relish and enjoyed every bite of yummy, warm, sugary goodness bite.  I'm happy to see Krispy Kreme back...so happy that I live far away from it.  It was a bit of a drive, but well worth it!

Yech. Seriously, yech. I don't understand what the fuss is with Garduno's.  I was visiting friends in Vegas and hoping that we would go to Viva Mercado's (I truly heart that place so much) and instead I'm being dragged to a casino near their house - and it's a local casino that I HATED going to when we lived in Vegas - which just happens to house Garduno's. It's the Fiesta Rancho casino.  So not only am I doomed to suffer from bad mexican food (I have been to Garduno's before in that same casino) I am forced to wade through locals who are so hell bent on gambling.  I decided to order their fajitas. What a freaking mistake. They were sizzling and so deceptive. They smelled so wonderful. My mouth was actually watering. Then after I assembled my fajita into the flour tortilla, I took a bite.  Nothing. No flavor, even the onions had been blanded out. How the fuck do you do that? Seriously. How the fuck can you get onions to lose their taste?! How? HOW? H O W ?! I could only tell the difference between the bell pepper and the onion thanks to texture. Their "rice" was just that...rice.  It was a disappointment through and through. Service was ok and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. The food was shite.  The atmosphere is loud. But I don't think their location within a casino really helped with that. You could hear the slot machines outside of the restaurant. One slot machines was so freaking loud I could swear I could hear it over the din of everything...and it was shouting, "WHEEL OF FORTUNE!!!" I kid you not. If it were a kid I'd have turned to it and said, "You're indoors now. Little voice."  Decor is such a throwback to the 80s. You know what I'm talking about - that alleged upscale restaurant with the puffy booths and that nasty peach/pink pastel color teamed with green along with the sea green acrylic tabletop. ugh. I needed an intervention when I was sitting in that place. Badly.  After all that hassle, I even paid for the crappy food for my friends and myself. I waved good-bye to my friends later on and made a beeline for Roberto's. Yea, I was that pissed off and angry at my food. I'd have gone to Viva Mercado's, but they were closed at 2am.  Just a note -- why did Garduno's get voted best as one of the Best of Las Vegas? Does anyone in Vegas have taste buds? If they did, they'd be screaming for either Roberto's or Viva Mercado's as a Best of Las Vegas.  Seriously, don't fall for Garduno's anywhere. I've had the misfortune of eating at 3 different ones in 3 different places -- don't fall for that nasty, bland, SALTY food.

When I used to get my nails done (10 years ago) I used to go to a little chop shop that used a drill...the drill cut me and it was all over. I never got my nails done again, not even for a manicure.  It doesn't help that I work with a lot of metals and nasty chemicals that could preserve an army of small animals, plus...with my metal smithing, it really doesn't make sense to have nice hands. Or does it?  I took the plunge a month ago and went to the Pampered Pinkie.  I. LOVE. IT. L-O-V-E  I-T.  They don't use drills (yay!) and they file by hand. It's friendly, fast and relaxing. You feel like you're over at your best girlfriend's house - you just want to sit and eat ice cream as they do your nails. I kid you not. It's that comfortable.  The initial cost of the manicure was $33, but when I went for a fill it was only $28 - talk about a steal!  The only downside to this is that it's a bit of a trek out there for most Yelpers. I'm somewhat close and when there are no accidents on the 101 South, it takes me 15-20 mins.  I'm happy it's close to the house. :)

Still a fan! The girl that I normally went to left and I asked for Chris...and I didn't think it could get better than the girl who I had before.  I was wrong. Dead wrong.  Chris is even better. She works quickly and got it all done.  She was running a little late, but I was fine with that.  I'm an even bigger fan than before!

Ya know...for a fast food chain, this place has permalove written on it from me.  Maybe it's due to their fish tacos...and their loverly (yes, loverly!) shrimp burritos...or their refried peppery bean goodness.  I always have had consistently good food at Rubio's - no matter where I've been - Las Vegas, Mesa, Chandler, San Jose, etc. It's a chain, but mercifully it's no Long John Silver. Everytime I've eaten at Long John Silver, well...loosie pewps and we'll leave it at that.  TMI, sorry.  Hubby usually goes for the chopped chicken salad bowl, but I've noticed the size varies from place to place and state to state.  If I ever have a craving for a shrimp burrito I usually head on out to Rubio's - it's cheaper and far yummier than some of the sit down restaurants.

I used to have a super cool guy who did my gardening...then one day he stopped coming over, citing that he had bigger jobs and he was the only one who was doing all the work. He was clearly overextended and my lawn was long overdue for some help. Our HOA was leaving dirty notices taped to our garage door and soon we were getting nasty letters saying they were going to put a lien on the house. Geez, go away for the month of March, it pisses down rain, and weeds sprout...I came back at the beginning of April and found these guys by advertising on craigslist.  These two guys are the most capable gardeners you will ever find -- they show up, are friendly and courteous...they even didn't even flinch when I warned them about the doggy landmines that could possibly await them - I did my best to pick up after puppy, but the housesitter didn't pick up after puppy while I was gone.  It took them a day to get through the front yard and the backyard, but I've never been happier with them.  This is one of my best kept secrets for gorgeous maintenance of  our fabulous land...and now I'm sharing it with you.

YAY!  I finally found a place I can trust to get my hair done at.  :)   It was pitiful, I'd gone a year...yes a YEAR since my last haircut.  The reception area was nice and welcoming. While waiting I perused the products that they sold -- Aveda, Redken and Dermalogica. It was was wonderful.  Laura was the girl who cut my hair and persuaded me to donate to Locks of Love. I would have done so a long time ago, but I was always told my hair was too overprocessed. Seems things have changed and I donated a good length of my hair.  The salon and stylist made an overall good impression. They were friendly and not standoffish at all, much like when you step into other day spas.  I left happy with my hair cut and hair color. I only got one color and no highlights...next time, I promise and I'll write an update on my 2nd visit. First visit has been good.  :)  Some people may find the drive out to this one a long one as it's off the 10 going to Tucson, but it's right around the corner for me...and I don't have to deal with Chandler Mall Parking like I do at the other Madison Avenue.  Overall, I'll keep going to this wonderful place until they close or we move...but I have a feeling I'll be moving out of state before they close.  Superb quality with extremely fair and competitive prices.

Dropped in today for the first time...and can I say it's worth the drive?  No attitude. No c*nty saleswomen like that OTHER PLACE THAT SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED.  Cashier, sales people and customers were all so darn friendly and helpful I don't know what to say other than...YAY! I'll drive the 20 miles here to get my dog the food he needs.  Buh-bye local business pet store that's closer to me and sells the same brand of food I buy for my dog...I'm a fan of the BEAST!

I'm a huge nerd -- I love crystals. When I found out about this museum I dragged along my suffering hubby and cousin. She has this unholy and frankly, an embarrassing love of rocks so she was only too happy to go.  This somewhat small museum houses an amazing collection of rocks and crystals in various stages. It's not quite the collection one would find in say...the Chicago Museum of Mining and Minerals, but this is darn good, too!  It's a bit disorganized, but if you're happy to wander and read you won't have any problems here.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The gift shop?  So so. Nothing I'd write home about.  There is a nominal fee to get in, but you do tend to spend a lot of time roaming around and looking at rocks and various crytsals. They've got a hefty collection of them. I wish they had more precious gemstones in their finished cut and polished state, but I was quite happy with what I found.  It pays to return  every few months because they have new exhibits and some of them are quite cute. So far my most favorite display they did was make food out of various rocks and crystals...it was amazing and so realistic. When you got up close and studied the 'food', you soon realized that it's all rock and crystals. One could tell it took a lot of time and effort to get that done.  It's a great way to pass an afternoon and even a person who dislikes rocks and gemstones would definitely be enthralled with this museum.

You know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood? I'm one of those people, but this time I teamed my seafood with STEAK!  They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Year's Eve dinner, but I skipped over that...  I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I can't tell you how I've gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasn't de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me.  Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didn't make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great!  Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didn't have it blue which was the way he wanted it. It's all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib I've seen in a long time...  For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of 'bacon makes everything good!' and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didn't make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!

What an adorable store! Completely dedicated to dogs -- cute little outfits and wonderful treats. The girl working there had her cute little dog all dressed up in a pink little puppy shirt and sparkly collar.  I'd never do that to my dog (he's too scruffy for that!), but I saw so many adorable outfits I was sorely tempted...  Located around the corner from Coach, it is absolutely adorable!  Service was friendly and prompt -- can't ask for anything more in a retail store.

I came back here after having been gone for over 5 years. Not sure what happened or if I had better memories of this place than what it really was but...the cookies all tasted like shortening and sugar.  I was so disgusted by the sugar cookie I bought I ate half of it and threw the rest out. Hubby's ginger molasses was pure sugar and didn't taste like like ginger or molasses...just sugar with some flour in it.  The chocolate chip cookie also was so sickeningly sweet.   Not sure what happened with their cookies, but they went so far sweet they're inedible.  I won't even start on the turkey sandwich I ordered. It was terrible as well. Maybe I got to the place on a bad day, but when I come back to AZ again, I will make sure to skip Paradise Bakery...it was not a paradise kind of hit for me.

Brand spankin' new...customer service with a smile.  Good selection, good prices, friendly customer service. Bought some stuff to make the house better - garage door opener, some hooks to finally hang that darn 65 x 78 painting up...  Nothing at all like Home Depot, either. I found the fixtures for kitchen improvements here to be of higher quality as well.  Thumbs up from me...plus, it's so close to the house - not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. Time will tell.

Located next to *gulp* Pei Wei, I am never able to persuade friends to actually eat food here. For some reason, they get all ADD distracted by Pei Wei and I'm overruled. Part of the reason why I meet my friends for lunch is so I can spend time with them and eat good food. /cry Pei Wei is not good food.  At least they agree with me and go to Paradise Bakery for a cookie after.  I've eaten a this Paradise Bakery because it's close to friends homes and work. It can be busy and very loud. The soups are not bad.  I've eaten several different sandwiches here and tried various breads and there is something about the bread that I do not like - it has this odd, sweet aftertaste to it. I've had their turkey cranberry (I expect it to be somewhat sweet bc of the cranberries), california turkey sandiwch and their paradise roast beef. At times they can skimp on the meat on your sandwich if you're there during a busy lunch hour. Other times sandwiches are so full I have to take some of the meat out so I can get my mouth around the sandwich!  Whatever you do, skip breakfast here. It's just not their thing and to make matters worse, it's a bit pricey for microwaved eggs.  For me, Paradise Bakery's crowning glory are their cookies. Everything else falls flat. Their cookies are soft and chewey, not overcooked and so crumbly to the point that it leaves cookie residue on your clothing. I'm not a fan of their brownies...they're far too sweet. I can't believe I said that bec I have the biggest sweet tooth on the face of the earth!  I like Paradise Bakery.  It's a yes from me!

I used to frequent this shopping area quite a bit and even set foot in this store when it first opened. It had been busy and I was overwhelmed by the number of people that showed up. I left, vowing I'd come back.  Prior to that my experience with Philosophy had only been in department stores like Nordstrom and Sephora.  I have visited a total of four times and each time, there was such a level of unfriendliness that I encountered, it turned me off the brand completely. I know it sounds petty, but I was never greeted in any of the times I set foot in that establishment. However, the people that came in after me were greeted. When I had questions, I had been rebuffed twice and once I had one of the girls walk to the back and not come out until (it seemed like) I had gone.  On my last and final visit, I came in and was browsing. No greeting...however, when my husband came in, he was greeted. (he had been to the barnes & noble next door)  In the end, I purchased some Philosophy's Hope In A Jar from Sephora...and that product had such an unpleasant smell...It reinforced my visits to their physical store front - unpleasant.  I'm done with Philosophy for good. I know I should never have deviated from my Eminence or Clarins love. Philosophy taught me to stick to the lines that I know and benefit from.

I actually find myself driving out to this BJs instead of going to the one in Chandler. It's more of a trek, but I don't have to deal with crappy mall parking.  Ok, this one is next to a PF Chang's (don't get me started on that...I HATE that place), Chipotle, Red Robin and a very defunct Krispy Kreme (*cries*...maybe it's best that it's closed).  The reason I always go to this BJs is...the salad. The BJs at the Chandler Mall makes me angry. Very angry. If I am going to fork (no pun intended) over $10+ for a salad, you had damn well better give me more friggin lettuce. I've been to the one in Chandler a few times and will write a review on their beer.  I'm also a fan of their regular pub fare-ish food - burgers, chicken wings, fries, etc.  But it's their salads that keep me coming back. I'm a huge lover of their Garden Medley with grilled chicken and Field of Greens.  This BJ's can't go wrong!

I read the reviews. I had a craving for Flip food...so I dragged poor unsuspecting hubby along.  It's located inside the mall around the corner from the nail polish store. *swoons* Nail polish AND Flip food? Momma's come home. Too bad that nail polish is more expensive than that food!  Anyway, I was slightly put off by it not being a restaurant, but I got over it once I had that pork adobo goodness in my mouth...and all that RICE! The BBQ chicken. O.M.G. TO DIE FOR!  Their lumpia shanghai was good and 3 for $1 - I can easily see people totes forking out mega money to get that full feeling!  I met Chona and she was a total sweetheart. Note to self: add her on FB. :)  I really enjoyed the cassava cake and atchara.  I can't wait to bring mommy here when we're in AZ.

Located in the same shopping area as Hollywood Beauty Supply, it's not the same.  If I thought HBS was disorganized, this is deceptively disorganized. I say that because although they've got the racks for the polishes along with the names of the polishes on the racks - it's not the polish you are looking for. VERY hard to find things in there.  I brought along a friend and the man with the 'customer' that he was helping before me made my friend feel very uncomfortable - they trailed her around the store because they thought she was going to shoplift...word to the wise: Just because she looks like she's going to shoplift (because she's black, you know), she's not going to. She's been known to spend 10x more than I ever will in places. Don't go by the stereotypes, ok?  Nail polish is also more expensive than HBS.  OPI is $5, China Glaze is $4.  The *only* thing they've got for them is that one of the lines they carry is cheaper than Hollywood Beauty Supply, but in all honesty, I'll go and spend that extra dollar at HBS because HBS is friendlier, the guys know me and they've *never* made any of my friends feel uncomfortable. They did have a color I was looking for...but like I said, the whole atmosphere of the shop won't make me buy from here.  Side note: I got yelled at because I went to the back of the shop and saw that they had more nail polish in boxes. I was just looking at the nail polish in the box and moving things around (I put them back the way I found it, btw....I hate it when someone does that to me, so I do my best to not do it to others) when I got yelled at, "THAT'S ALL THE SAME COLORS THAT ARE UP HERE IN THE FRONT!!!"  Really? You sure about that? Because I can find it better back here than in that disorganized mess up front!  I'll go to an e-tailer, pay the $4 + shipping because ya know what? There is no way I'm going to ever feel that uncomfortable ever again.

I used to drive super far to take little Rex here...and then I discovered their Mesa location.  This location is the newest one they had at the time...and it showed. It was all gorgeous and shiny - very pretty.  From the front desk staff to the doctors, we received nothing but the best treatment, not only in customer service but also in how they interacted with Rex.  I can't say enough positive things about the Family Vetcare clinics.

I've said it before and I've said it again - one of my biggest issues with Indian food in America is that is disgustingly sweet. Cloyingly, tooth rotting, horrifyingly sweet. Sadly, India Oven is no exception.  I came here for their buffet lunch and left after small scoops of rice, chicken tikka masala and palak paneer. Service was wonderful and friendly. Garlic naan and tandoori chicken is brought to your table and not on the buffet. I'm not a fan of tandoori chicken - I never have been. I ate a little bit so it wouldn't seem like I didn't appreciate it. Yea, will never be a fan of tandoori chicken...sorry.  Overall, the service is great, but I wasn't a fan of the food. I don't like sweet Indian food. It's not the stuff I grew up with.

I wanted to give this place 5 stars and I can't in all honesty. The service was superb, the presentation was superb; even the clientele, superb.  The food? Meh. It was ok.    For an appetizer/starter we ordered Coconut Crusted Shrimp. It was all right. I've tasted better. I wasn't blown away, but I was happy that the shrimp wasn't so deep fried that it was rubbery.  I ordered their Diablo Shrimp Fettuccine. I was hoping it would be less capers based, but every bite I took tasted of capers.  To the point where I just had to push it away after 5 bites. I am not a fan of capers, but I can appreciate and love the flavor they can add to any dish. No dish should be overpowered by them.  I can't remember what hubby ordered, but he, too, though tit was ho-hum nothing to write home about.  I have to say the surroundings were absolutely wonderful.  I loved it. I felt very welcomed and very comfortable. Whatever they were striving to achieve in terms of atmosphere worked. You could have this place as a dinner date type of restaurant.  I'll come back a 2nd time and try something different...but for now, I rate it 4 stars for ambiance and service.  Now if only the food could have kicked it up to 5.

I've been lucky to stay at other Westins in other states and I'm happy to see that this one lives up to the hype of the others.  Dare I even venture to say that this is the best one of them all? I think I may have to.  While some people complain about the sparseness of the hotels, the lack of decor, blah blah blah...I think to get mired in fussy BS decor really isn't it for me. For me, it's the comfort factor. To be honest, if they had that fussy fussy girlie shit decor, I'd be a little put off. I'm the kind of girl who hates frills and hates overly decorated hotels.  That said, some of the best nights of sleep I've had in my life were here. The bed was PERFECT. I like firm beds and this was a firm with a slight bit of give - wonderful! I hate those scary blankets between the sheet and the comforter/bed cover - you know what I'm talking about...those velux blankets that are either yellow or blue.. *barfs* Mercifully, they are not found here. YAY!!! Instead, you get a down comforter or something like that. It set my allergies off along with the down pillows, but I will take extra allergy meds to offset that.  Staff was friendly and accommodating. Better than some 5 star hotels I've stayed in.  Location is great - a couple of small blocks away are Alice Cooperstown, Tilted Kilt and a host of other places to eat at. All easily within walking distance.  When we go back to visit, we will definitely be staying here...plus, this place is DOG FRIENDLY!!!! We will be bringing along little rex rex next time. They provide food and water bowls and a dog bed for pampered puppy to sleep in.

Service was good, but this is all about the pricing...  After carefully reading the pricing details online, I decided to book with Fox because it said $250 for 5 days PLUS the additional coverage on the car that I chose. I knew that after taxes, airport fees and whatever the F fees get tacked on, it would be about $350, maybe $375, pushing it $425.  Check in was easy...until they said that there is a deposit required because I was using my checking account. Ok, not an issue. I whipped out my Amex. Still a $150 deposit. Hm. They needed my flight information for when I was leaving PHX or else they'd run a 'credit check' on me.  "Everyone does this now!" claimed the worker. Yea, right. Didn't happen last week, or the month before at Hertz and Enterprise when I was in other cities and states. I think it's theirs. If they had been up front with me on it, ie "We have cheap thugs who are late in returning." I'd have been a lot less irritated. I wouldn't have been irritated at all.  Car was a POS whose TMPS kept going off, despite me dropping a metric poop ton of quarters to keep that MFer at the recommended 40psi.  Dropping off wasn't so bad - it was easy breezy.  Overall I was charged $509 for a CHEVY SPARK whose tank of gas I didn't even use up and $8 in quarters keeping their TPMS in check...so $509 for 5 days + a 'security deposit' of $150. The original thought of $425 is what it would have cost me anywhere with all their various added taxes, but there is no documenting where the $509 came from and I am loathing the call I am about to make to get them to break this down for me. I'll be reporting back.
