Botanical Gardens are where the Artist in both Humans and Nature collide.  The Phoenix edition highlights the flora of the Sonoran desert, though a few desert plants from South America are also scattered throughout the grounds.  The variety of Sonoran plants are impressive.  However, I must admit that the natural state of the desert itself is its own botanical garden.  The sparseness of the vegetation and the dramatic ecosystem changes over short distances can be found in the abundant State and National Parks of the area.  What you won't find, however, are the Human Art pieces.  There were a number of architectural features and designed spaces that meshed together beautifully.  Also, right now, the glassworks of Chihuly are prominent throughout the garden.  Beautiful and otherworldly, they make a gorgeous display.  They do, however, steal the show and diminish the impressiveness of the natural beauty of the garden.  (Try coming at night for a light show in the gardens--we weren't able to.)  Overall, this is a fairly impressive botanical garden and should be a stop if you are in the Phoenix area.  I'm a fan.

I despise this airport.  I've breezed through check-in and security before, but enough times it's been the utter nightmare from hell so it forces you to arrive 2 hours early for a flight.  Renting a car here is ridiculous.  It's the absolute longest ride on a shuttle to the "rental car center" that I've ever seen.  I'm not joking.  Add another 15-20 minutes to that 2 hour lead time, folks.  And there are no gas stations around it, probably because if there were it would get robbed daily.  The fallout shelter design--the place is a concrete bunker, after all--while hardening the facility in the case of a direct nuclear strike, also prevents cell phone reception.  Don't count on being able to call people and say "i'm here, come get me." when you are in baggage claim.  Phoenix has special place in US aviation.  Yes, it may be one of the only major hub airports that will shut down because it's too damn hot to fly.  Be warned.  On the plus side, the concessions are fairly decent (if somewhat forgettable), and it's pretty easy to get a non-stop flight to/from here from most places in the country.  Free wi-fi, but that's starting to become the norm rather than the exception.  Meh.

This is sort of a captive audience restaurant.  If you're making a (half) day of the gardens, it's worth coming here.  There's not a whole lot close by to compete with it.  The concept is farm to table, and the items on the menu seemed to follow that trend.  We both wanted to eat light that day, so both got the fish tacos ("locally sourced" Mahi Mahi??).  The flavors were good, but the execution could have been better (one example being the dry/burnt corn tortillas).  And the meal was definitely light--large appetizer portion.  Not all their meals were like that--the Sonoran Dog (with fries) looked fantastic and could feed two people, easily.  I'd recommend having an extended discussion with the waiter on what you want before you order.  The ambience was superlative.  We ended up inside, due to the crowds, but the views were fantastic out of large windows.  Just a great space and experience overall.
