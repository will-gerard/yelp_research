From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, "Welcome to our business". I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone.

Great jewelers! Outstanding knowledge of jewelry and Gemstones. From their wide selection of fine jewelry to their expert repair work, the staff is exceptionally helpful and a pleasure to deal with they cater to your every need.  If you need jewelry repaired this is the place to go. I had a very good experience!

The food is very good. The texture and taste of their pastry is amazing and all gluten free.  I shared the 2 different macaroon I bought. We thought they were the best macaroon we have ever had. It was a pleasure to find this cafe in my neighborhood. I went during their new later hours and still found plenty of goodies to choose from.

People that work for this company Sara Briggs and Amanda Pinkerton are uncooperative, unprofessional and lazy. They do not show up when they say they will and ask other people i.e tenets to do their jobs for them when showing a house. Sara Briggs lost control of herself yelled and then hung up on me for asking a simple request. The request was to confirm that they received my 30 day notice. They have shady practices when dealing with their tenets. Even though she admitted that they received it she would not send me a record to confirm it.  It took a week passed the day only after her meltdown. Amanda Pinkerton also hung up on me for asking her to contact Sara Briggs in an an emergency situation. I recommend not doing any business with this company.
