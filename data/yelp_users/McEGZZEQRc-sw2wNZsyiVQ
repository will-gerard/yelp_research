Love it!!  Green Flannel is incredible and so is the Jalapeno Pecan Pancakes. Need to try it if you haven't already.

WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD RENTING!  My apartment did not have aproperly working washing machine, dryer, or dishwasher.  When I moved in there were missing blinds, the cabinets, over, and lighting were dirty.  I brought everything to management's attention on MANY occasions, and they never did anything about it.  When I asked for them to make things right, they refused unless I signed another lease.  OF COURSE I AM NOT GOING TO LIVE THERE AGAIN AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE!  And then they took my entire deposit for things that were already wrong with the apartment (and were documented).  I brought this to their attention, and again was ignored.  They could not be a more unethical business practice.    My advice: DO NOT LIVE HERE!  If you like the location, try Palladium or the random condos across the street.  San Marin is not worth all the hassle.    I should have listened to the reviews before I moved, but did not have enough time to find another place.  I really regret ever living there, all the time and effort I put into that apartment, and all of the disappointment when nothing was taken care of.  The management avoids all issues.

Wow they are terrible... Definitely live up to their reviews. I went once & had a bad manicure but thought maybe it was an "off day" and also it's the closest nail salon to my house... so I went back & had a manicure & pedicure... HUGE MISTAKE it was terrible it looked like a child did it! I had them done over at another nail salon & they laughed when they saw them. Never again.

Just tried this place for restaurant week. The staff was wonderful and treated us like regulars (we sat in the bar) but the food was OK AT BEST! I won't pay to go there again just simply because of the food. The cheesecake was freezer burnt and the steak was mediocre. The crab cake was clearly not made in house and was not great. I think my expectations were a little high for this place considering the price of a plate and I might as well have gone to Longhorns (steaks at Longhorns are much better and cost much less). Anyways, like I said the people were great, but the food isn't...

This place is amazing! I was there for a work dinner and the atmosphere, staff, and food were incredible! The owner was right outside and asked what we though as we left and it was definitely worth every penny!! Perfect date night spot also. Can't wait to go back!

This place has excellent deals and great food!  I love the bean dip and the salsa they give you complimentary!

Love it!!  Such great food!  Unfortunately, they do not honor discounts from Yelp anymore for some reason, so don't go in expecting to be able to use your percentage off you earned by checking in!  Otherwise, love the food and lemonade!
