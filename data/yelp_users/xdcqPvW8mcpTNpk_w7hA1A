If you need any alterations, this is the place you should go. Zari is very friendly, kind, professional and does a wonderful job. Prices are fair and you will always be happy with the result since she is very experienced. Do not doubt to go there if you need any alterations!!

Don't ever go to this place! Don't even try! They wanna charge you more than other places for no reason while the guy tries to convince you they charge you more because they do a better job! That's a joke! Once i took my suit there and they closed at a time they were supposed to be open and i was told that my suit would be ready at that time. I had a flight right after and I couldn't have my suit while I really needed it just because they were not responsible to keep their store open during their working hours for no reason!  Totally ruined my day! Hate this place! Never try!
