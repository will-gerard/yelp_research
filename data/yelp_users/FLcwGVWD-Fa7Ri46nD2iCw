My friend rented clubs and they forgot to put in a putter. Our golf cart had a max speed of about 3 mph.   No drink cart or halfway stop on white wing. Some old hag thought we were playing too slow and yelled at my friends and I saying "too much beer and not enough golfing!"   And oh yeah, it takes 55 mins to get here from north Scottsdale.   I wouldn't play here again if you paid me $100. It's basically like an old folks home surrounded by a golf course being canvassed by a bunch of surly curmudgeons.

I come here because it's convenient, but this place is the worst. You try to get a simple oil change and are constantly dealing with shady fast talkers who are trying to up sell you on seat shampoos and various other detailing services your car "needs" that "for this weekend only they can take off 40%"...but every time I come here it's the same story!    Unfortunately it's right next to my house so I will probably continue to subject myself to their ethically questionable business practices...but not without writing a crappy Yelp review first!!!

Love coming to this place on a Thursday evening for the live music and solid food.

This is the best and easiest BBQ in North Scottsdale.  My wife and I get takeout here once a month at a minimum.  I would highly recommend checking it out. At first, it may seem like a car wash or gas station but you will quickly realize it is one of the best spots around.

I was shocked to see this place have a five star rating on Yelp.  It must be the owners posting over and over again because there is no way it should be rated that highly.  We got takeout, thank God, because the interior of the restaurant reminded me of a 7-11.  No offense to the owners, but the dining area floor plan is a mess, complete with garbage bag table cloths and a massive Pepsi machine in the middle of the room.    I ordered Chef Claudio's Favorite.  The sauce and pasta weren't bad but the ham was basically cold cuts you would get from  Safeway...not what you would expect from a 5 star Yelp restaurant for close to $20.  My wife ordered the Quattro Formaggi, very much overkill on the cheese and had a very chunky consistency and gritty texture.    Again, I hate to bash a place but this is a 2 star restaurant and these 5 star reviews are absolute nonsens
