Manuel's is consistent. Service is fast and friendly. Chips are warm and salsa is satisfying. When I worked closer, I'd come regularly for work lunch. We would time them bc food came out so quickly. Record time from server walking away with our order to returning with our food was 4min 53sec! Food is nothing that will wow you but if you're looking for a filling, mediocre Mexican meal (which I often am), Manuel's is a must.   Also, they just finished their remodel. Bigger bar and brighter atmosphere.

Carlos O'Brien's is perhaps the largest restaurant in the world (overkill? Maybe, but it's still a pretty big place) and there is this strange swing hanging from the rafters in one part of the restaurant.  I really wonder what it used to be.  But, now it's Carlos O'Brien's.  If you are dining in, order the queso dip.  It is delicious! But that's really all I would recommend.  Everything else is mediocre and super cheesy.  However, if you are using them to cater, I say order the mini chimis, mini tacos and mini flautas.  Great price to feed a large party at your house.  Also, with the size, there is never a wait.

Friendly staff, clean and typically pretty quick security lines. They are making an intentional effort to have only local restaurants (at least in terminal 4) and prices are the same as they are outside of the airport. Shame it's my home airport because I'd be thrilled to eat at these restaurants.

Outdoor museum so don't go in the summer. Took a class field trip here and the docent spoke clearly and was very patient with all my students. She was well informed and knew how to navigate the hundreds of questions a group of 8 year olds will ask. The museum is a must for gaining a deeper appreciation of the rich history that truly exists in this young city.

I bought my car here.  Love the car! It was a very easy experience...did most of the negotiating over the phone. Day of purchase, I was out of there in 20 minutes. I'd be a repeat customer.

Seamus is there for every occassion in your life.  Maybe it's St. Patrick's Day and you are hankering for some corned beef and a guinness - GO!  Maybe you're watching a show at Orpheum - GO!  Maybe you go for a run every Thursday with your friends and are super sweaty and thirsty - GO! (and join our run club, don't be a fool and run alone).  Seamus McCaffrey's is an old, long and narrow bar (just like the Philadelphia bars I've come to love so much) that has strangely cozy dorm-room furniture.  Be warned: it is definitely a local bar.  If you went to high school here, expect to see a fellow grad.

Super friendly! Went here to buy paint and magnets for my classroom.  There were lots of color options and many different shapes and strengths of magnets.  Also, if you are in the market for some good people watching, this place delivers!

Let me begin with the negative: terribly slow concessions.   Now that I've covered that, this is my go to movie theater! It's huge and always empty. It could be opening night and I'll only be sharing the theater with 10 other people. I think I've only been to 3 movies here that were full. If you would like to walk into a movie five minutes late and still get the best seat in the house, I recommend this theater. Clientele is along the lines of what you could expect at a downtown theater: mixed.

Brought my nieces here for a morning activity in the summer. I've never been to a busier library. There had to have been an event going on because there were at least 30 children there with their parents. It was so exciting for my nieces to just people watch and make new friends.   When the library isn't busy, the children's section is at the perfect height for children to explore on their own. One whole section of the shelves has the books displayed with the cover facing out. Great! And, when (...if) a book does get chosen, there is a cozy spot to sit and read.

Every Tuesday I look forward to coming out to Tempe bc I know I get to have an early nacho dinner! 9 times out of 10 the chips are fresh fried for my nachos which adds to the delicious melt of the cheese (fresh grated, no goopy "cheese")! I am a huge fan of their green chile. Very spicy but not so spicy that you miss all the other flavors. Staff is always friendly and the crowd is usually interesting to watch while eating alone (I'm sure they're watching me back...)  Food and service aside, you can't help but be entertained by a restaurant with a disco ball as a permanent fixture.

Don't be nervous when you feel like you're walking into someone's janky apartment.  You're not.  This place has got tasty nachos that you can eat with chop sticks (this allows me to feel very cultured...except, I usually just use my fingers because I'm not that proficient with the sticks).  I recommend their nachos with the chorizo.  Great late night snack.    Just a heads up, not sure how long it's going to last for (hopefully not forever!!) but the last few times I stopped in they've been calling themselves Rezbots (yes, like a Native American Reservation).  Don't get me wrong, the fry bread is delicious.  But, when you're going for nachos, fry bread is a mean trick and then you just end up asking someone to drive you to the closest Julioberto's...be warned. (try and be in the mood for both fry bread and nachos.  Win-win)

Birds are so hot right now.  This coffee and tea house delivers exactly what it claims (except I don't drink coffee).  The tea was good.  Nothing amazing but nice on a hot day.  The important part about this place is it has plenty of space for you to spread out, plug-in your computer and get straight to work.  Quiet environment, very spacious and nice downtown location.  Not too far from the lightrail.  Very phoenix-urban.

Rotating taps. $9 flights. Best pretzel bun in town. I've never left unsatisfied. If I had to complain, it gets super loud in here.

Some of my favorite hamburgers in the city! The grilled jalape√±o on top is what seals the deal. Delicious and tart lemonade. Caramel milkshake is ridiculously good. Every time I go, I walk away excessively full.   Small indoor seating area. Clean.   Owner is often there and very friendly.

I think their flapjacks are my favorite! I highly recommend. Chorizo is good too. Bloody Mary is satisfying although I'd prefer spicier and less dill.   This is my go to place for margaritas. Friendly service, clean and trendy environment.

First two times I went, I loved it and was very excited. Whenever new places open downtown, I feel such pride. Unfortunately, it's been less than impressive my past few trips (I know. I should stop trying.) The sushi wasn't great, my table was dirty and so were the ones around me, and the service was slow. If you're just going for a drink and edamame, this place fits the bill. Anything more and I suggest you go elsewhere.

The Vig always satisfies. Nachos, trifecta, carne asada on a potato pancake. Yes, yes and yes! The inside is small and I would describe it as Restoration Hardware if Restoration Hardware was a bar. Great portrait of Fillmore on the wall! Great ambiance. But, this Vig is my favorite because of it's outdoor space. Full bar outside and plenty of lawn games. Great spot to enjoy the weather when the weather is nice.

The hours stressed me out a little because every time I wanted to go it wasn't opened. Don't worry, third try is the charm! It's everything I want downtown Phoenix to become. Clever cocktail names, exposed brick and cement columns, friendly wait staff AND food service until 2:00!!   It's a bit pricey so I wouldn't go for more than one or two drinks. Great spot to start the evening.

Baker's will always be missed but I am happy to have Dig It as the replacement. Owners and staff are just as knowledgeable and friendly (maybe even more so). For the small space, they have a great selection. Lots of indoors plants to choose from too. Now that I have my own home, I've purchased many plants from them...and am happy to say all but one are still alive!
