Used to be a great spot to go, but they are now over priced and the service has gone downhill!  I've been going to UB since I moved into the area (5 years) and you would think being the only bar of its kind in the area they would be working towards improvements but it just keeps getting worse and worse!

I was in the fitness industry for 4 years, when I left the industry I needed to find a gym to call home. I went to Mountanside and was very impressed. The lady that gave me the tour was wonderful and the facility speaks for itself.  So I joined! That's where the joy ended. The front desk staff is rude and standoffish! God forbid you need to buy a water or smoothie or something from the juice bar. They are so put out by it!! The kids club attendents for the most part were nice. In the exception of one, and she was extremely rude! The membership counslers look down their noses at you, unless they are trying to sell you a membership. If you like a friendly hometown feel gym this is not the one for you. If you like snooty people who think they are better than you, this is the gym for you!
