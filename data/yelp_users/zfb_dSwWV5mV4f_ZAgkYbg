Good, solid Mexican food with a semi-healthy slant.  Don't know what the other Yelpers were complaining about when they talked about poor service--perhaps they went on a Friday night when the place was completely packed and the servers were crazy busy??  My experiences here have been the polar opposite--GREAT service!    Today our server brought us free queso dip (AMAZING!!), refilled our drinks before they were even halfway empty, and brought each person at our table their own bowl of salsa.  She even remembered us from ONE previous visit--pretty awesome if you ask me!    I just love their enchiladas!  Great vegetarian options too--definitely try the cheese/onion and mushroom/spinach ones if you're not a fan of meat.  Love their black beans and Mexican rice (which comes with corn in it--yum!).  Good chips and salsa; we always get the table-side guacamole too.  And if you have room for dessert, the sopapillas (with a side of vanilla ice cream) are totally worth the extra calories!  ;)

Yet another great local restaurant brought into being by Joe Johnston (creator of Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Real BBQ).  The place is built out of a revamped 1930's grocery store and is super cool inside!  They have a wood fire pizza oven (you'll see all this wood stacked outside on the patio -- adds to the cool ambience) and swanky espresso bar.  The bathrooms are pretty awesome too.  Most all the food is amazing here.  The pizzas are really tasty, so much so that I never seem to have the self control to not order them and try something new.  If you're vegetarian or trying to eat more greens, try the veggie pizza -- made with local produce, whatever is freshly picked ends up as toppings!  Salads and sandwiches are also delicious.  And the dessert selection is always pretty great.    The only negatives are that the place can get incredibly busy at peak hours, so come early or be prepared to wait.  Also, food (entree, drink, dessert, etc.) adds up quick and can get kinda pricey here.  Another bummer is that the waitstaff won't seat you if your whole party isn't present, which has been an issue/hassle in the past when a large table was needed for a birthday party or special event but all the guests had yet to arrive.  Other than that though, it's wonderful!  Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal!

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!  LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).    FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!        SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive!   I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)           As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.    The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.  So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

This is one of my fave Italian places in the area.  It's one of the Fox concept restaurants--which all seem to be pretty good from my experience.  Cute inside - brick walls, kinda dark, you order at the register and they bring the food to your table.  I really love their salads and pizzas.  My fave salad is the Vegetable Salad, which is basically a bunch of chopped fresh veggies (corn, cucumbers, carrots, avocado, etc.) served over a bed of mixed greens with tangy dressing and a roll on the side.  Even my friend who "hates vegetables" loves this salad!  Pizza-wise, they all come on a thin, crispy crust which is nice because you don't feel like you need to be rolled out the door after you eat.  I really like the Portobello & Artichoke and the Mozzarella, Fontina, & Basil pizzas but have heard from my carnivorous friends that the ones with meat are also pretty good.  I'm always too full for dessert but I'd imagine they're tasty, as everything I've ordered in the past has been good here.  Definitely recommend!

Probably my favorite place for fast, fresh Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Big portions, quick service (unless you get there at peak lunch hours and have to wait in a horrendous line), clean, and very nice employees (not sure why other Yelpers had issues with them??).    I love their plain cheese quesadillas--I always ask for extra guacamole and get a side of rice/black beans for some extra protein; unfortunately, they charge the same price for a cheese or meat quesadilla, so being veggie, I always get the meat on the side and give it to one of my meat-eating friends.  Friends and family LOVE the salad dressing.  I also really like the key lime pie for dessert (although my hubby says it's way too sweet).  Make sure to pick up one of their stamp cards--you get a free meal when you buy ten.  Great place!

Ay yi yi!  I hate leaving bad reviews but sadly, this one is deserved.  I'm a bridesmaid in a friend's upcoming wedding and the bride decided to order the bridesmaids dresses from here.  Everything was fine and good...until the bridesmaids dresses failed to arrive by the promised date.  The poor bride and maid of honor made repeated frantic calls to see if the store could put a rush on the dresses or at the very least, provide a new estimated arrival date.  The staff here was very rude and unprofessional -- they never once apologized for the delayed dresses, got flustered and angry on the phone, and refused to pay any extra amount to have the dresses rushed so they would actually arrive on time.  Very bad customer service!  In the end, the dresses arrived a mere week before the wedding, the bride had to pay out of pocket to overnight them to out-of-town bridesmaids, and we all had to pay extra to have them rush tailored.    If you're a bride, save yourself some unnecessary stress and find another place to look for your wedding accessories!  Bad bad BAD!

This is our go-to breakfast place -- not only because of the delicious food but also for the ambience.  The restaurant is family owned (the owner Susan is usually onsite and super friendly) and run out of a cute restored old farm house.  They have indoor and outdoor seating (the patio is dog friendly).  Without a doubt, each and every out of town guest we bring here LOVES it!  Favorite dishes include Susan's Apple Pancakes which come covered in a delicious apple cider sauce (yum!!!) and the Green Chili Omelet (reminds me of being in New Mexico!).  Tasty freshly squeezed orange juice too!  They are very accommodating with substitutions or if you have any food allergies.  The only negative is that it can get REALLY crowded during peak hours, amassing super long lines.  So, get here early!

This is our favorite little neighborhood Mexican food place.  Family owned and staffed.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of available parking.  A couple TV's with sporting events always on.  Good chips and salsa and really tasty guacamole!  Nothing fancy but always clean, comfortable, and friendly.  My husband rates a Mexican food joint on the strength of its bean burritos and after searching far and wide, has decided this place makes one of his favorites -- which he always gets with chile verde sauce.  He also likes their chile rellenos.  Being vegetarian, I like their quesadillas and enchiladas...but when I was still a meat eating kinda gal, liked their chicken chimichangas and shrimp tacos.    They are closed on Mondays but open every other day from 11am-9pm (8pm Sundays).  They also offer stamp cards for frequent diners -- pick one up, rack up some stamps, and get a free meal!

My favorite bakery/cafe in the area--beats the socks off Paradise, Kneader's, & Cafe Zupas in my opinion!  Healthier, more thoughtful options and greater variety of salads, soups, sandwiches, and pastas.  Their baked goods are also pretty amazing.    Favorites include the Wildflower Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which comes with arugula, tomatoes, and several types of cheeses (including Brie!!) on one of their amazing grilled breads.  A little bowl of tabouleh or potato salad usually comes alongside as well.  Their vegetarian soups are all delicious--selections vary by the day.  Their ravioli is great--served with some epic garlic bread.  Have never had a bad salad here either.  Cupcakes and croissants are worth trying as well!  Oh, and if you're looking for a loaf of bread, I highly recommend the Rosemary Sea Salt Sourdough!  One of my favorite places to eat!

This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!).  The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes.  It's a really cool space!    You order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields.  The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network.  Food-wise, everything here is good.  Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes...the list goes on.  Side Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!).

This place is a gem!  It's nestled between Joe's Farm Grill and the Agritopia urban farm.  Small inside--tends to fill up rather quickly during peak hours--but there is lots of great outdoor seating which you can take advantage of during the 355/356 days of beautiful weather here in Arizona ;)   Pretty much everything I've tried here is good.  Great breakfast and lunch sandwiches, drinks, and baked goods.  The fo-nuts (baked donuts) are literally to die for!  They're my fave thing here.  I'm not a fan of the cupcakes, although they are adorably cute--all decked out with glittery frosting etc.  They were a bit too dry and hard for my liking...but maybe I just went on an off day.  This is a great place to study, meet friends to chat, or just sit by yourself and read the paper or a good book.  Cool, moody music is usually playing.  Young, hipster kids work the counter.  It's nice to have a local coffee shop/bakery that doesn't scream "corporate America."

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.  Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.  After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to sauté the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.    In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

This is hands down my favorite place to walk my dogs in the entire Valley!  Many different dirt paths meander and intertwine to give a multi-mile walking path through dense vegetation and various lakes/ponds.  Sometimes, mid-walk you just might forget you're surrounded by traffic and urban sprawl--it really is that beautiful and peaceful!    The Riparian Preserve is home to a bird sanctuary where ducks, geese, herons, and song birds nest and feed.  They also have an observatory that's open Friday and Saturday nights, BBQ's where you can grill, picnic benches to eat at, and a lake where you can fish.  It's a great place to walk, run, ride horses or bikes, or take your annual family Christmas photo--which half of Gilbert does every Fall.    My only complaints are that some thoughtless individuals fail to clean up their trash (not sure if their mothers never taught them to pick up after themselves or they think a magic fairy follows them around for the sole purpose of disposing of their junk) or worse yet, their used fishing lines--this one's the bad one though--I've actually seen poor ducks who have mistakenly swallowed fishing hooks swim around helplessly until they die--true story.  Really sad stuff.  Other frequent visitors have said their dogs have stepped on used fishing hooks and hurt their paws--so just watch out for that if you're walking by the fishing lake with animals or small children.  And if you're fishing, PLEASE take that one extra minute to dispose of your junk!    Also, some other losers decided the Riparian Preserve would be a good place to dump their unwanted house cats--which over time has led to a burgeoning feral cat population, which preys on the nesting baby birds (as told to me by one of the park rangers); you may see some of these furry predators as you walk around.  So please, if you're considering giving your poor house cat the boot, find a friend or animal shelter instead of setting them loose here.  Alright, I'm done ranting.

My fave pho place in the Valley!  Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch and the restaurant itself is beautiful (definitely not a hole in the wall!).  The walls feature murals of bamboo and pretty, artistic photos of women wearing traditional Vietnamese dresses.    The place is family-owned and on several of our visits, the owners have come and chatted at length with us--very nice people!  They WILL remember you.  Being vegetarian, I recommend the veggie pho (selection V4 on the menu), which is like a tofu/veggie explosion in a soup bowl; it has mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bok choy, cabbage, and tofu plus the bean sprouts/lime/jalapeños that come alongside.  Really fresh and good!  I also love the vegetarian egg rolls--they're unique in that they come with lettuce and pickled veggies to wrap around them--they're my favorite egg rolls I've ever had hands down!  Recommend this place highly!

This is hands down one of my favorite pizza places in the whole valley!  New York style pizza/garlic knots/cannolis served by the nicest brothers in town.  They WILL remember your name.  Don't be surprised if when you call for takeout, they give you a ridiculously long wait time (up to an hour)--it's only because they make everything fresh with the best ingredients (and everyone in town knows it, so the place is usually packed)!  Their margherita pizza is heavenly--but you will repel vampires and those around you for a day or so due to the garlic--but it's SO worth it!  Also, the food is a bit more pricey than a normal pizza joint but I think it's justified for the quality and taste of what you're getting.  Highly recommend!!

I really like this place!  They make eating your veggies fun and easy.  Being veggie, I skip the meat section altogether (which has a good selection by the way) and pile on the cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, and tofu - yum!  Then, there are several types of noodles and a huge spread of sauces, oils, and spices to add as well.  I think it's best to use a separate bowl for your sauce mixing and also make sure to grab a piece of wax paper to help smush your ginormous food pile down while you're loading to maximize space!  A small bowl will run you about $10 and a large, $11 for lunch - prices jump up about $2 for dinner.  Your meal also includes soups, wontons, rice, and a drink.  I think they may also have an unlimited option - which scares me a little bit!  :/  Pretty good deal considering I always leave stuffed after eating just the small-sized bowl!  One after thought I had was that this place might be problematic for people who have food allergies (poultry, peanuts, shellfish, etc.), as all the food is prepared on one of two large grills - which they don't really clean between customers.  Just a heads up!

This is the ONLY place I go for my alterations.  It's clean, convenient (located on the West side of the San Tan Mall), friendly -- and most importantly, they always do quality work.  They've tailored several bridesmaids dresses for me, along with some other less important articles of clothing and everything they've worked on has always fit perfectly!  The only reason for the 4/5 stars is price.  This place charges more than most other places around the area but I believe that you get what you pay for!    They're open daily 10am-6pm, closed Sundays.  Cash or check only.  Be prepared to wait a while if you come at a busy time -- they have 2 dressing rooms which can fill up fast!

This place is one of my guilty pleasures!  In my opinion, they have the best deep dish style pizza around.  Even though the menu offers a broad range of dining options (from Mexican to Asian fare -- good for picky eaters or big groups with diverse tastes), I'm always drawn back to the pizza.   I also like the minestrone soup (a tad on the salty side though) and their wedge salad is really good -- also pretty decadent, drenched in blue cheese and dressing.  They make their own root beer which is amazing!    For dessert, you HAVE to go with the Pizookie!  They expanded their flavor list so there are even more tempting choices.  If you're dining alone or feeling bad about all the fatty pizza you scarfed down, they have a smaller/personal size Pizookie AND if you can't decide on one flavor, you can do halfsies.  Pretty great!  Definitely recommend...if you're not on a diet  ;)

I've been here a couple times and have never really loved what I've gotten.  Their smoothies are alright (I prefer the ones from Thrive and Jamba Juice).  And their food is so so -- smallish portions but at least it leaves you feeling light and less stuffed.    When I was still eating meat, I had ordered a chicken wrap once that I didn't finish because it was kinda yucky and on another visit, tried their fish tacos which were actually pretty tasty.  Have tried their cookies as well and wasn't impressed.  This time around, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they now offer "meatless chicken strips" by Beyond Meat, which I asked them to sub for the roast beef in their Wasabi Caesar sandwich.  The meatless chicken, while super flavorful and tasty, was hard and rubbery in texture which was a definite minus but the rest of the sandwich was good.  Overall, not my favorite place but also not the worst.

Just LOVE this place!  I always get the all-you-can-eat buffet which has an amazing range of food choices for all kinds of eaters.  The meat section has a variety of chicken, beef, lamb, and goat dishes.  For vegetarians like myself, about a third of the food bar is made up of different veggie-only dishes--my favorite being the Paneer Tikki Masla--I always go back for a second helping!  The servers (who are all very attentive and pleasant) bring out a steady stream of hot garlic naan bread--which is my second fave thing there!  They also have a small salad bar and mango lassi, mango custard, and rice pudding for dessert.  If you go for dinner, they bring tandoori chicken to your table along with the naan--so if you're vegetarian, make sure you tell them not to bring you any from the get go!    Bollywood music videos play on all the TV's.  The place can get pretty packed around peak lunch and dinner hours, so go early!  Lunch buffet costs $8.95 and dinner buffet runs $9.95.  Pretty decent prices for amazing all-you-can-eat Indian food.  Definitely the best around!

Had lunch here today and was very impressed!  The place is pretty utilitarian inside but definitely clean and comfortable.  I ordered the Veggie Primavera wrap with a side Greek salad.  The wrap was literally bursting with veggies--cauliflower, zucchini, broccoli, 2 types of beans, and rice all on a wheat wrap.  It's definitely not something you can eat gracefully!  Sooo good but so much food I had to take half home!  The wrap was served with a side of delicious tzatziki sauce. The Greek salad was also good--lots of fresh veggies; the salad dressing was a little different than your "normal Greek"--had almost a spicy horseradish/mustard taste which I'm not sure if I liked or not.  Beautiful presentation, huge portions!  If you order your entree as a meal, it comes with either a side salad or French fries and a HUGE cup for soda.  Will definitely be back!!

This place would be your good, dependable neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I feel like it's not quite as authentic as Siam Orchid or Tum Nak Thai (both family run by husband/wife cook/wait teams) but they serve up some solid tasty food.  They have a good range of vegetarian options -- I seem to always gravitate towards the Mushroom Soup, which is as close to my beloved tom kha gai as I've been able to get since I stopped eating meat.  The Golden Tofu is also pretty good but I sub peanut sauce for the sweet sauce it comes with.  I like their Silver Noodles -- mmm broccoli!  And they actually make a Larb Tofu, which is just alright in my opinion; even though it's been years since I've eaten beef, I think the dish tastes better with it than tofu.  My husband really likes their Beef Panang Curry and Pad Thai with pork.  They have good lunch specials, a great rewards program, and very nice staff -- they always remember my name when I come in!  I don't think you'd be disappointed here.

This place is my go-to place for smoothies.  Way better and healthier (tastier too in my humble opinion) than Jamba Juice!!  Even though they're known for their acai bowls, I'm so obsessed with their smoothies that I have yet to try one...but I plan to someday.  Family owned, clean and cute inside.  Definitely try the Mango Passion and Tropical smoothies!  Really flavorful and loaded with antioxidants too.  Smoothies come in 3 sizes--kids, medium, and large with a huge straw that looks like it could suck up a small child.  ;)  Also make sure to get one of their rewards punch cards because your (my) acai addiction can get expensive!

Sales promises you the world but service delivers disappointment!  I have been to San Tan VW THREE consecutive Saturdays in a row for service appointments, each a progressively worse experience; and sadly, all my simple service needs have STILL not been met.    Do you like waiting hours for routine maintenance checks?  Do you like getting the runaround - showing up for scheduled repair appointments only to find out that your car parts were never ordered?  What about having one lonely service rep in charge of long customer lines?  Well then San Tan VW is definitely the place for you!   For the record, I am NOT a car owner who expects any sort of red carpet treatment at my service appointments but I am someone who desires a modicum of common courtesy, intelligence, and dependability.  Don't plan on finding that here.  If I had known what the service experience would actually be like, I would NEVER have bought our car here.  Buyers beware - two thumbs way down!

This place is just great!  The studio is smallish and cozy with separate male/female locker rooms.  Owner/instructor Jon is very kind and encouraging -- makes you feel welcome and tells you how great you did (even when you almost fall on your face).  The place is very judgement-free -- yogis of all levels/ages/sizes practice here.  It doesn't even matter if all you're able to do is lie on your back in savasana the entire class -- all are welcome!  So far, I've only taken classes with Jon (he sprays yummy peppermint essential oil in the air) and Heidi (who "walks" on your feet during certain poses -- which feels amazing) and have liked both.    I must say, Bikram is addicting!  If you're new to the practice, give it a couple tries and I promise, at first you may feel like you're dying but after a few classes, you will feel more alive!  It's been the only thing that's helped ease my lower back pain.  And after a long, stressful day, I find myself craving it.  Make sure not to eat a big meal right before class, wear as little clothes as possible, bring a yoga mat/towel/water bottle and an open mind.  There's a pretty awesome Groupon going on right now for the place too!

This place is AMAZING!!  My husband and I have been coming here for years.  It's located in the Dana Park Mall next to Firehouse Subs.  Appears to be run by a husband/wife team, Paul and Joy.  It is clean and smells nice, dimly lit with wooden floors, a fish tank, and peaceful music playing.    You start out in a reclining chair where they do foot and hand reflexology.  Then, they move you to a private room to massage your back.  I go in with stress and soreness and leave feeling completely relaxed and rejuvenated!  I have only had Joy work on me and can say that she is incredible!  My husband says Paul is awesome too.  They give you a cool bottle of water when you leave and have stamp cards for a free massage after you purchase 10.  1 hour reflexology runs you $30 + tip and they offer a couples special for $55 + tip for an hour -- the only tricky thing is making sure you get there when there are 2 available appointments but you can always call ahead!  Hours are Mon-Sat 10a-9p and Sun 10a-7p.  On a side note: Dear reflexology customers, please practice some common courtesy and don't snore like a lawn mower when you're getting your massage.  Yes, it feels good but have some self control and don't ruin the feel-good vibes for those around you.  When I went tonight there was a dude who was snoring louder than a garbage truck and moaning in his sleep.  If I wasn't so relaxed, he would've gotten his tub of foot water dumped on his head.  Seriously!  :/

Hands down my favorite food truck EVER!  Vegetarian, vegan, and lots of gluten free options.  All the produce is grown fresh and local.  Good for breakfast or lunch/dinner.  You really can't go wrong here.  Run by an amazing husband and wife team.  Everything they make is healthy, delicious, and filling!  For breakfast, try the quinoa breakfast bowl or chickpea frittata.  My husband loves the vegan French toast (and he's a rabid carnivore).  Their scones are to die for.  I've had several of the soups on their dinner menu and they are all great too.  My only complaint is that the Uprooted Kitchen isn't open every day...and I think they need to make a cookbook too!  ;)

I am NOT a fan of ice cream, so when a friend dragged me here and told me to order the Gelati, I was very skeptical.  I followed her recommendation and got the Gelati with strawberry Italian ice and vanilla custard and was blown away by how delicious it was!  The difference in textures/richness/taste between the Italian ice and custard is really interesting--they compliment each other perfectly!  I will be back for sure.  Great treat for a hot day!

Just ate here yesterday and the one word that comes to mind is FRESH!  I was struck by how fresh the cheese, bread, and vegetables tasted -- everything seemed fresh and high quality.  I came at a fairly slow time of day (after the lunch rush), so the food came out fast; I've also been there on days when they've been slammed however, when food took a longer time to get to the table.  I don't see this as a huge problem though because it just shows that everything is cooked fresh -- this place is definitely no fast food joint!  The servers are always polite and kind.  I've had the Caprese and Casa salads and must say I prefer the Caprese.  The Casa comes with these round rolls of shaved fennel, which I'm not the biggest fan of.  The bread they bring to each table is freshly-baked and very good.  I prefer the garlic cheese bread with some marinara dipping sauce -- but your breath WILL smell.  Their lunch-size veggie pizza is delicious but very large and in my opinion, doesn't taste good left-over, so eat it all and welcome the food coma later.  ;)  Friends also really like their sandwiches.    Lunch specials run from 11-2.  Happy hour from 3-6.  And I guess they have live music some evenings too.  One of the best Italian places around!

Their name says salad but I think the hidden gem in this restaurant is their amazing breakfasts!  For $4-5, you get a thoughtful, healthy, fresh entree that will fill you up and keep you going for the morning.    My faves are: **Peanut Butter Power Wrap on honey wheat (pb, strawberries, bananas, freshly made granola, and honey) **Breakfast Wrap on honey wheat (roasted red potatoes, egg whites, spinach, pico de gallo, avocado, cheese--and I ask for no bacon) ...and I'm SO not a breakfast burrito person but trust me, these ones are GOOD!  I've also tried the Warm Berry Quinoa Bowl, which I liked (but was just a bit too dry for me though--I'm more a fan of the ones made by The Uprooted Kitchen).  Oh, and for the record, their salads are great too!  ;)

Amazing cold pressed juices!  I'm officially addicted.  My husband makes fun of me because they cost about $10 per bottle but I feel like it's totally worth it!  So delicious and refreshing--I'll buy a few at a time and keep them in my fridge for when I'm craving something sweet--they keep well for a couple days.    My favorites are Unicorn Blood and Strawberry Fields (both yummy and sweet), their almond milk (they add a little cinnamon to it), and Skinny Genes which I think is a better pick me up than coffee--the cayenne pepper is guaranteed to wake you right up!

I really liked it here.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, cute decor, The Clash playing on the loud speakers (a wee bit too loud for my liking), and best of all - prompt chips and salsa delivery (for those of us who are famished and just don't like to wait).  Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.  Chips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, "it's like a meal."  Totally filled me up and I definitely had a lot left over.    Will definitely be back to try different agua fresca flavors and their veggie tacos!

Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the area.  SO glad they opened up a new one closer to my house!  The restaurant is a really beautiful space -- moody overhead lighting, cool art on the walls, and unique furniture spread around for a loungy kind of feel.  The servers are all young hipster types, very nice and attentive.  Literally everything I've tried from their menu is good!    Favorites include: the coconut curry soup, hummus trio, spinach four cheese quesadilla, lavosh pizza, garlic new potatoes, caramelized cauliflower with tahini, guava lemonade, and their amazing rice pudding for dessert.  All of the smoothies I've tried are good too.  I really don't think you can go wrong here!  Highly recommend.  Great place for flavorful, healthy, fresh food!

So glad there's a local vegan place now!  Went in today for a late lunch (weekday around 3-ish) and had the place to myself!  It's a beautiful and spacious restaurant with local art for sale on the walls and fresh flowers on each table.    They have a selection of teas, juices, smoothies, and sparkling water--don't expect a soda fountain here!  They also have a tempting dessert case filled with chocolates, cakes, and cupcakes.  Yum!    I ordered the broccoli curry stir fry--peanut coconut rice noodles, bok choy, carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli served over a bed of fresh greens.  Great flavor, portion size, and not too pricey.  Filled me up...but still had room for dessert.  Tried the coconut lime cupcake which was really good!  Will definitely be back!

I tried so hard to like this place but the food--at least what I ordered--just wasn't very good.  I got the artichoke spinach cheese dip which came with flatbread and fresh cut veggies.  Sadly, the veggies (alone) were my favorite part.  A previous Yelper mentioned the tomato bisque as being something to try and I was super disappointed--it was just meh.  Wildflower and Cafe Zupas soups put it to shame.  Good things?  The restaurant itself is stunning--all brand new.  Lots of attentive servers=great service.  Fancy soda machines.  Decent prices.  The smoothie bar looked cute.  Ugh!  I feel like I'm fishing here...  I think I will be back again to see if I just had a bout of horrible ordering.  The breakfast menu did look promising.

I bought their month membership off of Groupon (which ran somewhere in the $20-30 range) because the studio is located very close to my house.  This was my first Bikram experience.  Truth be told, the whole time I thought I was going to die...but somehow I didn't and actually ended up loving it, returning back for several more classes too!  The place is brand new, clean and pretty, with nice locker rooms and one huge yoga studio.  When I went, classes weren't too packed, maybe between 4-10 people of all different ages and levels.  Teachers were all great.  Lots of close parking.  The only reason I'm not still going here is the steep membership prices.  A few words of advice if you've never done Bikram before; the room will be about 105 degrees and 40% humidity, soooo: bring the biggest water bottle you can find (you will probably drink it all), stop eating a few hours before your class, bring a big towel to lay over your yoga mat, and wear as little clothes as possible (trust me, everyone is just trying to survive and will not be picking apart your every flaw).  Oh, and have fun!
