Let me start by saying how great EVERYONE is here!  Angel gave me the best haircut and made me look far better than when I walked in.  Downtown Scottsdale Hair & Nails was a great find!  Ask for Angel!

I was nervous to have a store repair my cracked screen on my IPhone 5s.  Normally I would go to the apple store but the price was more than double what this store quoted me. I took the chance and went for it. Within 30 minutes my phone was fixed and was good as new.

The food is overpriced for what they have to offer, the customer service leave a lot to be desired. Laura seems to be the only one that cares about the customers. The manager is absolutely horrible, nothing but trouble from him. He's rude, yells, and when a coworker found a PUSH PIN in her chili he had the nerve to accuse her of putting it in herself.  If you have no choice but to eat around there, bring your lunch from home.

Today I had a flight out of Phoenix and did not have time to have lunch at home. I was so excited to see one of my fav restaurants now open at the airport. I was excited to find the same great food and same great service but now at the airport. My food came out quickly, and one of the managers (Charles?) thanked me for coming in. The same great service I was used to at their original location. You can tell that everyone here is on their game!!!

I live in the neighborhood and thought I need to give Fame a try. So glad I did, such great breakfast items and the coffee was delish!!!  This will be my new regular spot, I hope they extend their hours into the evening soon.
