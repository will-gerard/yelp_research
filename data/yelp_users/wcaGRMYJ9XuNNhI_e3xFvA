Dr.Caniglia did a rhinoplasty on me just last week. I spent a whole month looking for the right doctor (I saw 4 other "top surgeons"). One of the top reasons why I chose him for my surgery was because he was the only doctor that had realistic expectations, didn't make me wait in the waiting room (like most do, since it's just a consultation to them), allowed me to see a visual of how my nose may look after, but most importantly talked about rhinoplasty like he's been doing it all his life. He didn't try to "win me over" he simply spoke facts. Him, along with the rest of his staff gave me outstanding costumer service and made me feel so comfortable. I had no swelling, nor any bruises. It may be luck, my Mexican skin (lol), but I prefer to believe it's the quality of the surgery. I would recommend him for any nose jobs, and I am forever grateful to him and his staff for giving me the nose I have wanted for a long time now.

Very good pizza! I asked for extra mushrooms and they are the only ones I know that actually take it by heart. They covered the whole slice with mushrooms! Low prices and friendly staff.

Pretty decent Mexican food place! Got chips and salsa for a starter and had red enchiladas for the entree. Pretty good service, nothing crazy good about the service or food. I wouldn't mind coming back here again, although I'll keep searching for the best Mexican restaurant in town! Can't really complain!

Used to come to this place for sushi a couple years back. Idk what seemed to have changed (management, quality of food), not sure but something has definitely changed for the worst. I decided to try it for the fourth time in the past two months, all trips were disappointing I must admit. Their quality of sushi, going straight down. This trip was my most recent one and will forever be my last.  I am a huge sashimi fan. I ordered my usual salmon sashimi, but when it came out not only were their pieces tiny for the high price, I even found some dark splotches on it. After looking at them I quickly lost my appetite.  Sorry to say I won't be coming back and will stray away anyone who attempts to. Wish I could say differently. Sad, this place used to be good.

After good reviews I came to this place due to the location and how close it was to my place. Though very small, it turned out to be for the best due to the comfortable energy feeling that I received. Very nice management, I was impressed with the quality of my nails. You can tell they took their time and care almost as much as you do. I think I've found my new place!

Awesome environment, friendly and professional staff! Me and my sister went here randomly on a Sunday, surprisingly there was not a line outside the door. There is a huge selection of seating where you will most likely be seated asap. I don't lie when I express how impressed I was with their food. Don't believe me? Try their pancakes and try to tell me they aren't the best you have ever had. Will surely be there soon!

Came across this place when walking around in the mall. They had a huge poster of ice cream that looked like heaven. So obviously I had to try it. They have two soft serve flavored, white vanilla bean and chocolate. Or swirl. I got the white chocolate and some mini pieces of chocolate that teased me too much to avoid. I was afraid that the ice cream was gonna be too chocolatey or thick. But it was perfect and still tasted fresh without too much of that chocolate taste! It was about six bucks. But worth it!

To be honest I came here looking for a new good place to get sushi. And after seeing all the reviews that praised it I decided to give it a try. Sadly the reviews were far from the truth. I've heard restaurants reaching out to people to write good views on yelp and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. Yes the restaurant was beautifully decorated, it looked promising at first with good costumer service and the decorations. Me and my boyfriend ordered each sashimi and a roll. I got a rainbow roll, usually try a roll I know pretty well when trying new sushi places. The sashimi tasted quite warm and not very fresh. Reminded me of McDonald's food when they freeze, unfreeze, freeze then cook their food. The furtherest from fresh I've ever had. The roll wasn't impressive or even bearable. The roll was missing a certain taste that comes in all good sushi. And it looked like it was smashed in really fast. The worst part was the wasabi, I'm a huge wasabi fan and very surprised when they brought out a dried out clay of green and called it wasabi. Very disappointed, maybe I caught the chef on a bad day or maybe I shouldn't trust yelp as much as I should!

First of all I'm a regular for this place when it comes to happy hour. Last time I came this really nice bartender offered to buy me my drink. They know how to keep good loyal costumers. Their sushi I pretty good for the price and they have a large menu of sushi. Their appetizers are awesome also, I always get the Rockin Shrimp! Never disappoints. Also all the house saki is not only DIRT cheap during happy hour it has enough variety for every person who has a different taste! My favorite alcohol drink is the Kiwi Cooler. It's just lime juice,vodka, fresh kiwi and soda water. Doesn't leave you feeling all sugary or bloated!

Good atmosphere, descent costumer service, pretty good food. Me and my boyfriend shared a pizza, big enough for both of us. We got a mushroom, veggie (forgot what it was called) it was awesome! Great spices and taste. Exactly what a pizza should be. The reason why I don't rate this place five stars is that I ordered two glasses of wine due to the fact that the quantity of wine was incredibly small for average. And we had the same glass of water from the moment we got there never got it refilled till we were practically done eating. I don't believe the waitress was lacking in her job, I think they were low staffed because most waiters were either taking orders or doing something else busy. Definitely want to come back but make sure not to order a 17 dollar glass of baby wine!

I was told of this place and it's wonderful reputation by a close friend. I'm a huge fan of ice cream so one day I decide to try this place out. I'm very glad I did! Not only did they have quickly and friendly service, the quality of the ice cream is beyond anything I've ever tasted! I decided to go on a whim and try the sweet corn flavor! You can say I will surely be back to have some more! Don't be scared away from the name of the ice cream. Sample it yourself!

Came here on a Thursday afternoon. So I know I can avoid the children and loudness from families. Ordered the over easy egg burger (forgot the name of it) it was delicious! And the fries are never ending so that's always a plus! The only downside is that they only gave us each ONE napkin. And the meal was a bit messy so I asked the manager for more napkins (when the wait or was taking too long to check up on us) and he have us ONE more napkin each. Me and my friend practically laughed out loud. And for the manager to have done that. The only disappointment was the obvious clinging as of napkins. Sorry don't mean to be whiny, but when your starving and just wanna scarf down your yummy meal but you can't because your napkins are soaked and no one is coming by to ask if you need anything, you can say it was quite annoying!

I can't find another sushi restaurant that's as fresh and yummy as this one. Not only do they have a picture book of each sushi roll they offer (which usually is rare for sushi restaurants) they have the best tasting sushi in Arizona. Calm environment with friendly staff. Favorite place that I recommend to any sushi lover!

Not going to lie VERY surprised about the low stars reviewing this place. The only thing other than bad luck I can think of is the fact the prices are pretty high. And I have to admit they don't use a lot of rice in their sushi. But that's the way it should be! These days cheap restaurants put way too much rice in them to make their dishes look bigger when their portions of fish is hardly anything. But let me tell you, the sushi you get at this place will be stupidly fresh and so good you will never look at 13 dollar rolls again! And I'm pretty picky when it comes to Sake. So of course we had to do the tester Sake tray (65 dollars). They give you a nice introduction of the background of each sake, including the taste, origin, etc. their was only one out of five that I didn't truly care for. Me and my boyfriend ended up getting pretty tipsy when we left! And since the quality of alcohol was so good we didn't have any come down or hangover. And that my friends is when you know you spend money well!

I went in here with a couple girlfriends yesterday morning, which was Super Bowl day. It was around nine in the morning so we expected it to be wild with all the snow birds and people who came to Arizona for the game. No surprise there was a lot of people, but I was surprised at how fast and quick the staff was. I'm sure they were expecting a big crowd and it seemed everyone was well prepared. They had a large sitting area and for a party of four we only waiting about two minutes. Once we got seated our waitress jumped on our table and asks for our drinks. She was really friendly and always came by to check on us. Which was a surprise to all of us because they had a full house of costumers. But the staff seemed to handle it very well, quick to everything around them and with a smile on their faces. And when it comes to any simple sit down restaurants that's 85 percent of the whole experience. I ordered a stuffed filled strawberry French toast which I could only imagine how many calories, but ate it all up. Very good, if they can handle super bowl then they can handle any day in my opinion.

Favorite thai food place I've tasted in a while. Not only are their prices way cheap for the wonderful quality of their food, their service is always quick and friendly. I guess you can say I might be a regular. Favorite dish is green curry, never gets old! Also the take out saves me sometimes when I'm too lazy!

I was recommended here by a friend specifically for eyelash extensions. I got Irene. Whom let me say does the best job I have ever seen. She takes her time and is so sweet. One day on an emergency she wasn't available so they gave me another woman whom I do not remember her name. What I do remember is her burping right above me and doesn't even bother to excuse herself and look away to do it. So for anyone who wants their eyelashes done, I highly recommend Irene.

Awesome place if you want a big bowl of REAL ramen, not the 25 cent packages you make at home. Been here a couple times already and every time the staff is very friendly and our food comes out pretty fast! They have house saki that comes in every flavor that the house teas come in! Not a big fan of boba, but if you are they have tons of selection for you!

Went here one night with a couple of girl friends who all live in the gilbert area (including me at the time) when we were in the Tempe area and had the case of late night munching. We came in a got seated right away. The service was pretty average, our waiter made sure we had our drinks full at all times.   I can't say I was pleased with the drinks or food they served. I ordered an ice tea of some sort and I could practically crunch the sugar in my teeth! The wings were almost cold when they brought them out and tasted like they hardly had any meat left on them!   Pretty disappointed at this location from all the times we have gone to BWW we have never been so grossed out by the food. Next time we want wings we definitely won't come to this one.

I came here after reading a lot of good reviews on this website and I'm really glad I did it. For me it's really hard to find good authentic Mexican food because my parents were born and raised in Mexico and my parents and grandmother used to make the best Mexican food which makes it hard to compared to today's restaurants. Especially with the lack of supply for lengua (cow tongue). I was very surprised not only the fact they had that kind of meat, but because it was super delicious! It totally brought back memories of my childhood and the good old days with my grandma cooking me dinner!

Loved everything now about this place. From the casual decorations to the super friendly (and obviously dog lover) staff. When you walk through the backyard they have homemade dog treats and water bowls for all the furry pets. I came in while I was dog sitting along with my own dog and decided to try a dog friendly restaurant and it was a great experience. My dogs loved it also! I got the cobbler (turkey burger) it was amazing! Idk what kind of bread they used but it was buttery and so soft I had to eat all of it!

I'm one of those people who tend to go to Day spas for massages with my boyfriend at least once a month. We discovered this place last minute today when we decided out of the blue to get a massage. Sadly all the places we usually went to were booked, so we decided to try out this place after reading all the wonderful reviews.  I have to admit at first we were VERY   sceptical about this place. Not only was the area (connecting smaller stores around, not day spa like), the room they put us in was an open room filled with everyone in it. We could see everyone getting massages by us.  But by the time they got to business did our perceptive change! The massage was phenomenal! They aren't afraid of adding pressure when needed (like most people who barely touch you). This is a place to go when you don't need all that lotion up to feel good.  They simply put a towel over and know how to touch ALL the right pressure points. We were also shocked at how low the price was. It was 70 (not including tip) for both of us for an hour. It was a normal massage price for them, when were used to at least 120 to 160 each!   We can't stop talking about this place and will surely come next time we feel a knot coming on. (Or when we just wanna be spoiled)

One of the best costumer service I've had in a while! All the doctors are friendly, make you feel comfortable, and are very helpful. I've recommended to a couple of friends, and some of my family goes here. After my first appointment they recognized me a couple weeks after and remembered my skin condition and asked me how it was going. Don't remember anytime when a doctor remembered me after only one time and knew exactly why I went in there a couple weeks prior

Such a fast, amazing quality food for anyone's type! I love the rice bowls they have. This place reminds me a lot of a mixture of costa vida and chipotle meshed into one good restaurant! The meat was tender as the veggies were perfect. Good place for a quick lunch!

For a first time medical user, it can be easily intimated to go into a dispensary when you might not know all the knowledge like others seem to know. This was my second time ever going into a dispensary, my first time at a whole other location was very unpleasant. so I decided to try Bloom. They made me feel comfortable and we're very patient with me and my questions. Great place for newbies!

Awesome food, especially for the low prices.   Came in on a random Friday afternoon, knowing practically nothing about this restaurant. I was glad to find the menu to be filled with a wide range of variety from burgers to rice bowls. I had tried for the first time, the corn bread they have which let me say was suppose to be a side dish. Ended up taking most of the table! Which after tasting the bread, was a good thing to have some left over. Had an order of the ribs which were cooked pretty good. Though I wish the sauce had been a bit tastier. Not complaining though, ate most of them! Definitely will be coming back.

Had so much fun. Loved the open bar for thirty minutes while it went around. It actually made it more fun in a bubble with a good amount of people, everyone trying to get their money's worth (45 bucks) and in Vegas that can buy you two drinks. So as you can only imagine we all went straight to shots. The view was a huge plus!

I recently went here with a friend whom is a loyal costumer of zin burger, although he admitted he's never been to this location before. So we decided to try it out! Lovely decorated and friendly staff. Ordered a "make your own burger" burger. I got a burger, with guacamole, bacon, fried egg, lettuce, tomato, pickles and American cheese. It was very delicious and fairly big! Complimented very well with their fries. Which to my opinion is fairly good. Nothing out of this world, but the burger compensates.

For anyone who goes to Old Town Scottsdale, please avoid Wasted Grain at all costs. I had a terrible experience tonight and I hope that this never happens to anyone at this place ever again. My sister and I arrived here on Sunday, September 6, 2015, at 10:15 pm to meet up with some friends. We stayed for about 30 minutes, drinking only water because we weren't planning on staying out late. When we decided to leave at 10:45 pm, I began to walk out of the bar with my plastic clear water cup when one of bouncers at the front door, whom I will call Bouncer #1, a bald Caucasian male in his early forties, abruptly snatched the cup out of my hand without any explanation and yelled repeatedly at me, "You can't do that!!" I tried to take my cup back and began to explain that my drink had no alcohol in it, that it was simply water. He continued to yell loudly at me that I needed to drink it inside.   So I followed his instructions and began to walk back inside the bar with my water cup but all he did was yell and try to take my cup back again as he yelled over and over, "INSIDE!!" Then he charged towards me so hard and fast that he knocked over the black line dividers, and was inches away from my face, still yelling at me. I was scared that he was going to physically attack me and I began tearing up because I never understood what was being asked of me. At this point, another bouncer, Bouncer #2, came up to us and tried to explain in a professional manner, as it should be, that I was not allowed to take my water cup outside. I found it shocking that such a small matter was escalated to the point where I was fearful that this employee was going to attack me. All that Bouncer #1 had to do was to calmly let me know I wasn't allowed to take my water cup outside of the bar and instead, he lost his cool and behaved in an unprofessional manner as he verbally attacked me in front of other customers.   As I walked away crying, the bouncer that had lunged towards me began talking to the other customers waiting in line. He proceeded to make fun of me and even said aloud, "It's not rocket science". I am only bringing attention to this awful experience so that hopefully, this will never happen to another customer at this place ever again. As for my friends and I, we will be staying far away from this establishment. I will be reaching out to management to make sure that they are aware of the type of employees that are representing their company.

They just opened this one not too long ago and I have already fell in love with this place. Of course the name and thought of mixing chicken and waffles isn't something that may sound appetizing but boy was I wrong. Not only was their signature dish, chicken and waffles delicious. Every plate that I have ever ordered has been really good, the meat has always been cooked to perfection and their drinks are really good! Especially the mimosas! Huge drinks by the way, ordered a cranberry juice and was surprised at how big it was. The prices are pretty low for such good food and the costumer service is pretty well also. I've never had an issue with the staff, in fact they remembered me the last time I went in which says a lot about the staff and how the restaurant manages. I like to sit on the outside patio, the seating is really comfortable and they have heaters in case it gets chilly. Plus they have huge television screens in front of the bar, which is always a plus. Definitely (if not already) going to be a regular. Try the fried mushrooms too!

First of all i'm a huge sushi fan and I have to admit I'm quite disappointed by the lack of good selection there is in Arizona. So when I found this restaurant with all it's great reviews on yelp I had to try it out and see myself. My boyfriend and I were not the least disappointed! Not only was the costumer service spot on, the energy of the restaurant was cozy and comfortable! The pieces were pretty common sushi rolls between 10-14 dollars (average). I got salmon sashimi and two other rolls (will post pics). Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! The rolls were really good sized! Best part? They gave us a complimentary dessert that was crazy good! Everyone who loves sushi needs to try this out! Beware though, we passed the restaurant a couple times. It's a bit tricky to find if you don't know the area. It's on the mini strip connected to the Fed Ex.
