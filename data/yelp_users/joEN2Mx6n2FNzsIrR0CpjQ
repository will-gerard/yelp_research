3 1/2 star rating?! How much crack are you people smoking!? I will give you three (3) reasons this place sucks balls:  -The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because, they certainly are not outlets. Three separate attempts in different walls (including a charge station proved fruitless. Sonofabitch!).  -Your courtesy people transporters make the most annoying, continuous whirling beep. Jesus Christ why?! Its obnoxious, but it fits your airport well I guess.  -Your employees are lifeless. I go in to get a protein bar, and the woman made 0% eye contact with me the entire time. When she said "have a great day", she must have been talking to the magazine rack.  You get two stars, go sit in think time and figure out how to call and hire an electrician who can re-wire your outlets. ALL YOUR OUTLETS...LOL.  Go sit in a corner somewhere and figure out how to properly run simple, basic crap. Like the people transporters...Get them to stop whirling like the Pope and Gandhi commandeered these vehicles, began grinding, and then left the alarm on demanding everyone watch them grind....  And finally, sit in a corner and figure out how to stop hiring vegetables. Look for people who can have the potential to smirk at me. Just a smirk. I am asking....for just a smirk. I am not that ugly...I think.  Charlotte....silly Charlotte.

This past week for Opening Day my father, fiance and self went to Karim's due to the egregious lines at all the local bars and pubs. Karim's is a small cobbler shop right off of Jefferson, and compared to other eateries it does offer a more limited selection. BUT, the selection they do offer is great. They have a couple different combo options for fish fry as well as the general burger and other eats. It has got a significant southern-down-home-cooking feel to it, as you would expect.   I chose a 2 piece catfish combo plate and a medium order of Okra Gumbo. Yes, Okra Gumbo. It was actually really good, but the cup they put it in was very small. I always ask what size bowl you get, but we were in such a hurry I never thought to ask, so it's partially my fault. The catfish pieces though, were AMAZING. They had some awesome varieties of different southern hot sauces and I dabbed that on the catfish, which brought even more life to the dish. It was cooked just right, not too soggy, not too dry. My dad chose an Angus burger combo and was very happy with the choice, and my fiance opted for the chili dog, which she woofed down, haha.  All in all, its a great option when everything else is crowded. They have a small kitchen, so you will have to wait for the staff to catch up on a busy weekend when going to the game. They pump out a lot of good food it looks like, so if you want some fried fish on game day, head on over to Karim's! I will do a follow up on their cobbler, next time I go.

I have been lucky to get really good service at most locations I dine at...That's why people call me Lucky (they don't). So when I get bad service, a generally OK experience becomes anything but OK. Lets buy a ticket and check out Alice Cooper'stown.  ~Fud/Drink~ General....bar....fare. That makes it really simple for everyone. Now they have some interesting food options, yes, but there is nothing special. Why elaborate further? Alice's joint only offers greasy fried food options, with little time put into the preparing of said items.  For a football event I went to, they were offering breakfast. I ordered a cheese/egg quesadilla which was "edible". Filled with grease, I had second thoughts after ordering it, but was hungry. Meh. Of the two stand out items on their menu, the 22 inch hotdog named "The Big Unit" is a big hit. Its big, yes....but that's where it ends. You pay $17+ for a big hotdog guys...its really nothing much to write home about. Why pay that?? If going to the Dbacks game, why not get one or two $1 dogs at Chase? Just saying... I must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher's mitt brownie. For $4.99 you get a HUGE warm brownie plus a scoop of ice cream, everyone at the table was impressed.   As for drinks, they really are just overpriced. I know they have rent, I get it. But seriously, $6.50 for a draft that isn't close to a pint? Horrible pricing decision. I would've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately. Nothing else to say, just too expensive for what you are getting!  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Atmosphere is OK, it could be so much better. The inside is fun on the surface, and they have some cool memorabilia hanging up..it is nice to see what Alice put out for us to view. But overall the bar is there for large groups to gather and talk, no extra fluff. When each Big Unit comes out, an obnoxiously loud ringing bell sounds and the bar staff yells out a chant. After a good 30+ rings, I was saved by the bell when my football game ended. As for service, we were the first table to be sat, and had anywhere between 3-8 people at given times. Service was consistently slow, despite the fact the bar was at about 1/2 capacity for most of the day. I had to flag down our waitress a couple times to get service, and remember that brownie I talked about earlier? Well, it sat on our table for 2 hours after being finished. It was still on the table when I had began leaving. So, service was bad. Really hitting the nail on the head, there was no reason why we shouldn't have been waited on more, especially since we had the largest group in the joint that day. Poor service..meh.  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, its not the best option for grabbing a drink and bite before games downtown. I have made suggestions for other locations, and those suggestions stand. They get 2 stars for location and a nice array of TV's for game day. They lose 3 stars for poor service, poor price for quality, and underwhelming ambiance. They can do SO MUCH BETTER...And until they change things, you can do so much better as well.

I am a total fan. I just began going to the Symphony on a general basis this year...already three times! All have been a great experience, and now I will pass off to you what I think about the Phoenix Symphony...  ~What To Do~ Listen to sweet sweet music. The business model for the symphony is interesting. I want to quickly point out in this section that they hold concerts at numerous venues in the valley, the prime and good 80% of them being at Symphony Hall. The variety of performances is fresh, not too much of either genre or historical music eras.  ~The Good~  They offer other types of events that you simply don't expect. I saw South Pacific in both a significantly stripped down play format, accompanied by the Symphony itself, was truly exciting to see such a different performance. It makes me into a real music buff, and I truly enjoy sitting back and listening to the great vibes and sounds these amazing musicians provide. The site itself is very pretty and classically done up, and as always, the location is perfectly situated right by numerous restaurants you can stop by at. But once again, before I go further, they are a complete symphony offering all the different types of music, including newer acts which you would usually see in other formats. Its comprehensive music viewing!  ~The Bad~ Not too much. The prices are as is, can't whine about them when the music is top notch quality. They have to make their money somehow. But being as is, prices do scare me away a bit. That's OK. The drink stations are also a bit expensive, and they barely give you anything. I always thought they could extend the food options further to light o'dourves and such...nothing too much. Honestly I am being picky at this point, really not much to be upset about.  ~The Down Low~ If you are interested in having a sweet date night or simply looking to tickle your eardrums with outstanding ear vibes, come here. Its a chance to get dressed up as well. They get 4 stars for variety of acts, a wonderful facility, proximity to restaurants, and the unique special events they put on. Enjoy the sound of music!

Fellow males of the human race, take it from me: Have you had a 5 star first date recently? Are you on one right now? You are? I am talking about one that is going insanely well in every way, AND the girl across from you is drop dead gorgeous? You know..the date where its totally time to head out, you both have overstayed your welcome at the bar you are at, but its so not time for you to two to part just yet? Wait...really? Awesome, HIGH FIVE! But wait.... what if the date is *drumrolls* DURING THE DAY!? Yes, that's right, a day date! Where do you two go on a crisp Spring day?! THINK QUICK!  Good ol' Jefe had this occur recently. My pretty little sidekick wanted to continue our date, and in a spur of the moment, I chose Desert Botanical Garden. Why? Its pretty....about as pretty as her. Right? Right? RIGHT?! So you go here and can quickly find out if she is a keeper! Easy: if she whines about being among the wilderness, there's your sign fellas. Ditch her and go frolic and try to catch butterflies....I'll allow it! Thankfully she was a keeper and we continued on. The weather was gorgeous and so were the views. Walking among the endless flowers and cacti, you can clearly see all of the amazing fauna Arizona not only supports indigenously, but can support from other locations. Broken into numerous sections, from the Native American Era Southwest to a "Butterfly Garden", this entire location is bound to please anyone. The views are beautiful, and so are the fun evens they put on all the time at night and throughout the year. It truly is an educational experience, and one I have enjoyed since I was a wee little Jefe in Elementary school field trips. Now as a man, I can enjoy it....in other ways.  It loses a star however for prices. $22? Seriously? I was not going to be a cheap ass and get my student ID discount on a first date, but c'mon man? 22 bucks? The zoo might be worth that....but flowers? Ahhhh! Also, they have a gorgeous selection of eucalyptus and other huge trees fenced in just beyond our reach....WHY can't I stand near the trees and enjoy their epic smell? Why...sweet Botanical Gods?! WHYY?!  4 stars it is. A good random date spot for you dudes who are smart, like me. Trust me, I have a beard.

I'm the very rare Phoenician who has been born and raised here. Most of the older, more established places really resonate with all of us, since we've frequented them so much throughout the years....or at least that is me. For those whom aren't from here, or do not know of Duck and Decanter, all you need to know is that this is THE ONLY BROWN BAG PLACE YOU NEED TO KNOW OF. Period.  **The Layout** As soon as you walk in, you see a number of things First you will notice the fun food items and nick-knacks on shelves, all usable and able to be purchased for use in your kitchen. Off to your left you will also see a coffee bar which is directly in front of the wine room. Each offer excellent products as well as experienced servers who can help you decide further. You also will see on the left wall a large selection of extremely high quality coffees from around the globe. Finally, to the right a large deli section with fridges filled with the same meats, cheeses, and sides you enjoyed in your sandwich  **Fud** The food is excellent, of course. Everything used is waaaaay above the quality of normal sandwich shops. You have a wide selection of fresh made pasta options as well as soups and other various sides. Its truly up to you to make your own brown bag special. My favorite is the Sonoran Chicken, with a wheat bread blend and swiss or provolone.... You can't go wrong with anything here guys. The staff work hard and care about your experience.  **What else?!?!** They have awesome music events planned out each week utilizing the patio out front. It is a two story building, so you can go upstairs and go up their for a group event if wanted.  ENJOY EVERYONE!!!!!!!

Armadillo Grill has always been a great go-to for good bar food. Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up. They are not simply a OTB or pool hall... they are much much more.  ~Fud/Drink~ As stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Once again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means "nice", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.  ~Extras/Rating~ Call ahead for specials that day/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately. Look online, there are numerous coupons available from different spots... I use Entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm! They aren't the finest bar in town, that's understood. But its drink specials, above-par food, central location and outstanding staff each earn a star, giving them 4 overall stars. Much love for the 'Dillo, can't wait to go back and check in!

I have been bowling consistently year round at every single bowling alley in Arizona since I was a little over 7. I have, for the most part, shunned all AMF lanes, minus the one on Christown, which has sentimental value because that was where I pretty much grew up bowling. This alley, much alike most AMF's, has horrid service, from staff that range of their mid teens to their late 20's and many whom despite their bowling background know nothing about how to treat the customer right. Most people know that lanes always staff people whom for the most part have a pretty big bowling background. That's a major plus when hiring. Unfortunately, like I said, they suck at servicing the customer.  Also, the lanes and the area around are really poor. Like one person stated before me, they have old screens, which is not the case at any Brunswick bowling alley you may go to. The floor boards are extremely slippery, and it can easily cause injury if you're foolish enough to run around on the approach, let alone go over the foul line. The food is comparable to all other publicly traded bowling alleys: its over-priced and is horrible for you....DON'T EAT IT! Drink prices aren't too bad considering where you are at, but its still bad. Bowling prices are always market rate...If you simply go on AMF's main company website you can get coupons to lessen the $$ you are spending. There is no reason to not sign up on a bowling mailing list and get coupons, they save you A LOT!   With all this said, I give it 2 stars. Its not the worst alley in town, although close to it. It needs MAJOR renovations, even something simple like getting new TV's would mean so much. Renovate, and you will see more business... I recommend you go elsewhere until they do just that. Go to privately owned and operated Let It Roll Bowl, just a bit down, with better rates and service. Go to pretty much any Brunswick, which will do much better on each level. Or, simply, choose another AMF, Scottsdale being the closest, and definitely a MUCH better option.  As stated before, message me if you want more details....I bowl a lot and can help you out! Later fellow Yelpers!

Rose Tuxedo did an amazing job when I needed a tux the most. Here's the situation: Offered a chance to go to a swanky Gala event, and its only in a week from that time. Most Tux places won't take you as a customer. But if they do, its gonna run you $20-40 extra as a "Rush Order". Rush Order.... But not Rose...They do not do "Rush Order". If you peer into their vast back area, you can get a glimpse of their hundreds of tuxes, ready to be thrown on..  Rose Tuxedo, it is!!  ~The Good~ Rose has a ton of options for your big day. Honestly, everything from the most basic tux package (which I got) to the high-end and vintage options. It is a mom & pop chain which is local to the area, so do not get fooled by the fact that there are multiple stores. The turn around time for me ordering, to having my clothes ready was JUST ONE DAY. Plus I ordered mine over the phone, without even going in to try it on. Upon trying mine on, it fit great, and I looked dapper last night at the Gala. I also took off shoes, since I had a pair, and got an insanely good deal. The store employee told me "...we get many people in here, but when you are kind and courteous we take even more amazing care of our clients." That came in the form of a discount, right in the heart of tux season. I got complimented last night, so let me compliment Rose! Great job once again, with the customer service...the turn-around time is beyond ridiculous and your accommodating atmosphere will definitely earn my business next time I need a tux to rent.  ~The Bad~ N/A.... Haha. Nothing here to see. Not a single negative to complain about. God I love when things work well.  ~The Downlow~ Screw Men's Warehouse and their $120 rentals. WHY!? Either buy your own tux at Burlington or Dillards Clearance....or rent here boys! They treat you right, its a small business, and you don't have all this sticky Red Tape to run into. A simple and seamless process, if you ask me. With that in mind, and knowing the fact that these types of things never usually go too smoothly, I must reward them with a full 5 stars! Go anywhere else and you are giving your money away, and probably sending that money out of state. Shop, Eat, and Buy local.... go to Rose Tuxedo!

Quick review here because everyone and their dog has reviewed them....  Highlights: -An eclectic menu in the main shop, from healthy breakfast options to Sushi..they have it covered -Dogs....DOGS EVERYWHERE! Bring your pooch, they are dog friendly -They have an amazing gelato selection. I love gelato. You should too -The coffee is amazing. My dad said that...he drinks drip each and every day. He is 72. He knows his coffee. Enjoy the coffee -They have great knickknacks which reminds me of Duck and Decanter -The pizza is OK....nothing to write home about. Its basic pizza in my mind -Their English Muffins are outstanding. They sell them individually. Get some -The wine selection is great and all...but why not just go to Total Wine? -The parking situation is just that: a situation...c'mon guys! -The girl outside manning the coffee station...she was a blonde...she was horrible. If you are out there on a Sat/Sun and she is there, beware -They need more tables...where are all the outside tables? TABLES! TABLES!  4 stars goes to La Grande for consistently amazing food, wide variety of options, generally good service, and all located in a great location next to two other community staples (Postinos Arcadia & Ingos). They lose a star for poor parking and lack of tablespace for all of us groups looking to hangity hang.

So many people have had amazing experiences here. Whether its the service you get , the food quality, the ambiance or the amazing deals... its all been said. But hell, I will say it all again..  ~Fud/Drink~ I have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.  ~Extras/Rating~  Regarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here.    No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water. The only thing I hate about this place, is that I didn't think of it first.. :) 5 stars because they deserve it, enough said.

Fast is fast..But faster is fastest. Avis, whom has no website or real web presence, is a quiet little  oil change spot whom is doing a damn good job....and fast. Let me go further...  ~The Good~ So fast. They change oil like Usain Bolt runs laps. Thats fast. I am trying to set a record for usage of the word "fast" in a Yelp review. I might have already hit it, which would be super fast. But not as fast as Avis. It took them about 20 minutes to do my change, which included topping off of fluids, lube, filter change, and a general inspection. They also cleaned out the front seat and vacuumed it. This sounds too good to be true, but it isn't. They are efficient and fast, like a cheetah on the prowl.  ~The Bad~ In the day of the Almighty Groupon (praise be unto him) a $42 oil change sounds like a lot. But I did get the high-mileage oil change, which increased the rate. Overall, this is the worst thing about the place. Most people, though, will gladly pay a couple extra bucks to get out of the place without getting up-sold by some grease ball and on with their life.  ~The Downlow~ Price matters to me, but so does the commodity we are talking about. The commodity here, is oil changes....fast. They also checked my fluid levels properly, as well as lubed me up and checked general maintenance. Well worth the price. They get 5 stars for speed of service, efficiency, customer service, speed of service (again ;-D ), and array of services. They offer more than just a simple oil change: they offer a fast oil change with great service and a number of other maintenance items or suggestions if needed. They get the Jefe Endorsement of Awesomeness! Stop in, this place rocks!

Gallaghers has never really been considered a nice bar... I do not know many people who would consider this a staple. Its there, if you ever need it...  ~Fud/Drinks~ The food is bland. Lets just call it as it is. Salads are a best example as to how a restaurant treats its menu. If its got good salads, then they must have amazing entrees. Well this works well for Gallagher's, because their salads are meh meh meh. I tried a Greek salad, which for some reason, comes with iceberg lettuce, crispy, dry, iceberg lettuce. SERIOUSLY!? All the other ingredients including the feta  tasted like they just came out of the box/can they were shipped in. Horrible food choices besides the salads. Greasy, overpriced bar foods that really serve no purpose than to make you fat. Lets just say the ingredients in all their foods are lacking significantly. The drinks are typical bar options. Beer selection is OK, nothing stellar, but at least they carry some local options. But nothing to note that will turn heads, just average.  ~Atmosphere~ There is no atmosphere really. Like an Applebee's, they put things on the wall and expect that to make the atmosphere of the room. No, it doesn't. There really is no ambiance or significant feel, its weird being that its a sports bar. The carpets are drab, by the way... just wanted  to point out that does not add to the experience. Waitstaff are pretty attentive, they do an OK job. But ya, the crowds aren't lively, and I can definitely name some other places you can feel the true sports-bar experience at.   ~Extras/Rating~ There is really nothing to add, other than the fact that an amazing resort, the Pointe Hilton, is literally a 1 minute walk away. They have amazing food options there, although its not sports oriented. They do have the Hole-in-the Wall restaurant as well, which is amazing western Bar-B-Q. Go there, honestly. This place gets two stars for being an average/below average sports bar chain with nothing much to offer. Their business model needs an update, there are some outstanding local pubs and eateries out here that loyal clients flock to.

V-Day 2013, destination: Roma Garden Ristorante! Here is the synopsis:  ~Fud/Drink~ Fiance got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and asparagus. It tasted well and had the flavors just right, the sauces were just a tad bland and oily. I got the Linguini Pescatore with mussels, shrimp and other fresh seafood mixed in a white wine sauce. I see a common theme with the flavors not being too exciting for other diners, which is a shame. Traditional cooking does assume that the flavors aren't supposed to overwhelm the entirety of the dish. If the flavors to you are bland, then I might suggest a place that over-emphasizes sauces, like the Olive Garden. I do agree, the white wine sauce was a less flavorful as others in the past, but I hate tasting the butter in the sauce, its a big turn-off in a dish. You have to  consider you are paying for the seafood, not the sauce...By the way, the seafood tasted fresh as it could be, the mussels  were especially fresh and flavorful. The shrimp also had the flavor you would expect from an animal living in the sea. The seafood was executed flawlessly, thus improving the pasta dish exponentially. The linguini was also cooked perfectly. The wines we shared were paired perfectly for our dishes, and although expensive, really tied the flavors of our dishes together.  Honestly, if you come here, get something that is special. If you get a simple marinara, spaghetti and meatball dish....just why bother? MAKE IT AT HOME, Lazy. Come here to enjoy something that is difficult to execute...that's why you eat out at a nice establishment in the first place. I hate seeing people complain that they can make it at home...Go home and let me try your outstanding dish, I can't wait to try it Emeril! **That sounds just like something Gordon Ramsey would say, with a few "stupid donkey's" mixed in.**   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Romantic...is what comes to mind, of course. Its a nice little spot with a cute little room for service, the tables are done up nice. No music is piped in, its a relaxing and calm atmosphere. The bar room area up front is done just right, its not too large/small or pushes into the main room ruining the vibes. High tops are available to sit at as well as a bar to walk up to. Our waitress Jen knew all the specials and did not rush through them on a busy V-Day night. Instead she took time to go over all the options and the wine selection. She provided us the best service I have had in a while from a server. She consistently would come up at the perfect time to check in on us, and she was so personable and friendly. When I mentioned the 10% check in offer (which i was unaware of until I checked in), she immediately gave me the discount with a smile. She received a big tip, she deserved it for making our night even more special. Also the busser was a gentleman, he quietly helped put grated cheese/pepper on our dishes and without us asking put our food in our to-go boxes. The service is excellent.  ~Extras/Rating~ On an excellent note, you get 10% OFF IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP! YAY! That 10% went right back to our awesome waitress, who got a good tip, haha. We also got a free Amaretto in a glass at the end of the night, really great touch to a wonderful dinner! This is a 4.5 out of 5 in my book, but I will knock it down to 4 stars because of the semi-bland sauce...But its a solid restaurant, instantly my personal favorite family-owned Italian spot. Jen once again was amazing, see if you can get her as your server. I highly recommend this spot!!

As a proud Phoenician born and raised, there is some sort of civic pride when I mention my airport. It is a very busy airport, indeed...but it is efficient, nonetheless. Also, before reading, keep in mind that TSA, across the board, is always a crapshoot of crapiness. I leave them out of my reviews, because we all know how "lovely" they are.  ~The Good~ Sky Harbor is one of the busiest airports in the world, and they are very efficient. I have never waited on the tarmac to take off, in my 27 years of flying out of the place. As air trends have evolved, so has Sky Harbor. We as a society locally have trended to hip and fun food joints, so what did Sky Harbor do? They brough in local popular  merchants like LGO and gave them their own stores in terminals. SCORE! I hate feeling like I am trapped in a cookie cutter food joint, so being able to attend an airport, and STILL eat local, that is full of win. Another nice thing is that Sky Harbor has volunteers that roam the terminals to guide aimless travelers. I have never used them, but they are always gracious and kind, and seem ready to help.   Being a big airport, you would think its a mess getting through the TSA. But since weather isn't a big issue, we can always count on arriving at a set time prior to flight to get ready for pre-boarding. I am a planner, so knowing I do not have to plan random variables is a big plus. The airport is right in the middle of all the action, and is 15 minutes away from most cities in Phoenix Metro. How much else can I say? They really did it right when they built this airport...and they continue to provide great service.  ~The Bad~ I have no real complaints...The parking rates are goofy, but that's the same way it is at most airports...If you are parking and leaving your car for an extended period of time, there are vendors who can provide much cheaper options, so problemo solved! I think my only beef is with some of the expansions they have done, which seem  to not really have helped much. The people-mover they built seems to try to make us more of a tech-savvy or next-generation airport, but we aren't an inner-city kind of town, so the mover was, in my mind, a big waste of money. Oh well. Nice airport, just wish they would put money in the right spots.  ~The Down Low~ Great airport. No complaints. 5 stars for customer service, flight success rate, updated restaurant/amenity selections, location, and general ease of travel. Do not hesitate flying in to this airport, Phoenix is an awesome city with an awesome-sauce airport. Woot!

I have been twice. Both times were great, the staff makes the place a charm to attend and go to.  ~Fud/Drink~ Well, the food takes an obvious second place to the wines in house, which there are plenty of. The staff understands how to interpret your pallet well, and easily helped guide my fiance and self through the options we had. We ordered some Sweet Red they had on the shelf which was perfect with the pizza we ordered. The pizza was a fine thin crust with yummy add-ins like pepperoni and olives, etc. The wines here all are fantastic, we had a hard time choosing from the selection they keep stock of. They also have some beers if you prefer that, although I believe the selection has changed.   ~Atmosphere~  It has a quiet, local and relaxing quality to it. I felt right at home and our waitress on each occasion was welcoming and attentive. It has a lot of homey qualities to the site, the bar area has a TV but its not in your face, allowing me the chance to pay attention to whom I am with, rather than other disturbances. They have an outdoor patio we briefly skimmed over. Next time I go I'll update on it so you have a feel for what it provides, etc. There is a general sense that loud noise is well out of the norm here, so boisterous parties are probably best left for reserving space for an event.   ~Extras/Rating~ They do host events, and they do a great job at hosting them from what I have heard. It is an awesome idea for a date, there isn't a better idea for a first date then some wine and pizza to chill to while you talk. They get 4 stars for having a good blend of food and wine/beer selection as well. Plus on top of that, the ambiance is perfectly romantic and will leave you with a great lasting memory! My fiance and I have a favorite wine bar, BUT this is a very close second!

Honestly, I might go broke if I lived within the general vicinity of this mecca of grocery stores.... This is the creme de le creme of Fry's, hands down the best single grocery store in all of Metro Phoenix.  ~What To Do~ Way too much. First you can shop for pretty much any specific grocery need you can think of. They have a Coldstone inside....yes, Coldstone. They have a coffee shop, a car rental counter, a valet.... they also have a cigar/wine bar which specializes in wine flights...and a top flight sushi station. *gasps for breath*  ~The Good~ Oh, there is so much good. This place is stocked to the gills with extras that we can only dream of at other locations. Their specialty bread area, with artisan breads is surprising. The wine bar looks nice, although I haven't personally tried it myself. Its hard to explain this spot, other than it is a Fry's on steroids. The food is a bit nicer, and each aisle or section has different higher end items that you just don't see elsewhere. This is Fry's answer to Whole Foods and Sprouts, yet at a Costco size level. You simply must go... like Nike, Just Do It.  ~The Bad~ WELL..... If you need a scooter, your battery might run out trying to see everything (I'm sorry about that God, that was my bad). If you loathe walking, in other words, then do not go here... All joking aside, the only negative I see is the location. It serious just plays directly to its clientele, upper class Scottsdalians (or w/e you call them, haha). People like myself in Central Phoenix and he surrounding cities are left in the dust, and its completely out of the question thinking about driving to shop here. Ha ha, no way. That's my biggest issue, just simply the fact that they placed this so far away from the other cities... meh..  ~The Down Low~ Despite the location issue, this place is too great to lose even a half a star. There is too much good stuff.  5 stars for the typical good service, large selection, additional never-before-seen amenities, and the comparability of service to that of higher-end grocery chains. This place steps its game way up. Scottsdale, you are lucky!!!!!!!!

Easley's really is the best you can get in town. I have been to a number of shops, and you are wasting a ton of time at those places....really you are  ~What to Do~ Anytime year round you can stroll in here looking for any combination of costume-wear...like wigs, accessories, actual costumes and rentals.   ~The Good~ This place is designed to be a one-stop shop, and believe me when I say they are just that. Plus its local, how can you beat a well-run local retailer? They have everything. I mean...everything. I went as Brick this year for H-Ween, and Great Odens Raven, they had a trident! The hair product to change my hair black worked like a charm, and in previous years each time i needed a small item, they had exactly what I needed. Its a treasure trove of awesomeness peeps. DO NOT go to a cookie-cutter shop when you can find the costume you are looking for, and in many cases numerous versions of said costume.  ~The Bad~ Because its so popular, things rarely run out...but it will happen, this place is popular. So being popular, you have to come during non-peak times of the year to get what you want....just come prepared and early for H-Ween!! The parking lot is small, so that's another negative come H-Ween time. The staff are running everywhere during peak season, so do not expect amazing availability of reps. They also at times can be a bit short...Its not ultra-alarming, I'll gauge this as I continue to shop here. I'll update if it becomes a continuous issue.   ~The Down Low~ This is the best shop in town, so no need to explain their rating, they get 5 stars across the board. No costume shop in the valley is year round and stocked as full as Easley's. Come down for virtually anything and they'll have it...bank on it.

I haven't seen Paul in years.....which makes me sad. He was my childhood dentist, from my first tooth all the way into my sophomore year in College. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the dentist and years, and my health coverage doesn't reach his network. I recently went to another dentist, and it paled in comparison to the experience I had with him. To be honest, I felt like dollar signs were hovering over me at all times.   Thankfully I found he is within Cigna's PPO network, and next year I will quickly add him as my primary dentist when we get to choose plans. I don't care about charges, etc. He is the best. I never was scared to see him, and you never saw any staff turnover. Best example could be that my original Dental Assistant was with me from the first cleaning until the last, and I believe she is actually still there.   His offices are cleaner than clean, you always get top quality service, and while I was there I never once second guessed their advice or service. Mind you, all this is coming from my experience as a child at this office, by far the toughest demographic to comfort. I can't wait to go back and say hi to the staff, they were all pretty much family to me. They always would ask for an update on my life and genuinely cared about me and my teeth, not dollar figures sitting in a chair. This is an awesome practice to take your entire family to, their service will stand the test of time.  Message me if you want more detail. Other things quickly to point out is that their equipment is top notch and services they assist with are ever-reaching. But, once again, message me if you have extra Q's.

Oh, how the great have fallen. What once was a beautiful and multi-faceted mall has now become a Meh-all. If you were born within the last few decades leading up to 2K and lived in the central Phoenix area, then you remember both Christown and Metrocenter. Well, lets first dive into "Spectrum" Mall....or whatever they call it these days.  ~What to Do~ Despite the lack of shops, this place still has a lot of things to do. You can go clothes/item shopping, just like any other mall. You can go grocery shopping at Costco. You can even go see a movie at the seemingly like-new Harkins they put up here a decade or so ago.  ~The Good~ They do have a lot to do. You can get a number of things done while here. Unlike any other malls out here, the Costco is built directly into the place. That's pretty cool, if you ask me. Instead of having a stand-alone building you have to drive to, its just there. The movie theater isn't half bad, and crowds are a bit less than other Harkins' in town. Some of the shops fill your needs for goodies, although there aren't many. Overall, its a unique center that fills needs for many local residents in the area.   ~The Bad~ Sigh. Where do you start? The place lost its luster in the mid/late 90's. Tenants left, and so did patrons. The aforementioned built-in Costco was nice and helped traffic, but still, the lack of stores is depressing. Just the sheer lack of oversight by the facility's ownership makes the mall that much worse. How can you let a good location go down so quickly? They had some amazing shops, had awesome card-shows, really fun movie theater within the place you could go up the escalator to. This place is a shell of itself, and has really turned into "Phoenix-Spectrum-Costco, featuring a Harkins!"   ~The Down Low~ Two stars go to the site for the two major tenants. That is it. Much like Metro, this place has really fallen off the map, and no one had oversight to try to stop it in enough time. Metro's is worse, in my eyes...but this is a close second. Go here for the Costco, a movie, and maybe stop by Ross to get a handkerchief to cry in when remembering how good the 90's really were.

I have to temper myself. This place makes me into a shopaholic. I am very frugal, and fight tooth and nail for the best deals. I swear to God, there is no other place in Phoenix I prefer to shop at for work and nice clothing, other than here. Why? Lets see.......  ~What To Do~ Shop to your hearts content for simply earth-shattering deals you can't even find on E-Bay. You can purchase anything from top of the line suits all the way down to ties, undies, etc. If you need work clothes, this place is for you..  ~The Good~ There is almost too much good. They have consistent price markdowns ON TOP of the gutted prices they already have. I just lost weight, and this was a perfect time to get new clothes.  I bought a pair of nice fine wool slacks for $25. Their original price: $125 before tax. Yep. I bought three, got them hemmed, and now I look like P-Diddy at work. Oh, and it doesn't stop there. I got my entire wardrobe re-stocked with work shirts, all for about $9.50-$18 each. Original prices ranged from $45-70. Insanity I tell you. Pure insanity. I saved, oh, just North of $500. I spend, for the record, $135 for three top of the line slacks and five new work shirts. I look slick, and my manager is slack-jawed at my new clothes (and that I can fit into them, haha).  ~The Bad~ Three things to point out as below par.  First, its at Metrocenter, which is the Flint, Michigan of Arizona malls. Second, they are understaffed with people who are only primarily managing the front desks and go-backs. Third and most important, are the clothes themselves. Many have sat on racks forever, so if that upsets you, so be it. Also the styles are a bit older, although for me its not an issue. A pink suit is a pink suit, not much to it. Some women might find some styles difficult to find, etc, but I can't attest to their taste. Also they have limited brand options, if you do not like Dillards store brands, just walk away. (Please note the one main exception to this is their shoes, which feature a wide variety of designer options which are pretty nice)  ~The Down Low~ If you are updating your wardrobe and must watch your funds, please just stop wasting your time somewhere else. Unless you must have a new fashionable shirt or item, just come here and save hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. Although I will round up to five, in reality, they get 4 1/2 stars. Three stars simply for the insane prices/deals, 1 for the range of styles and options for me to shop for, and and a 1/2 star finally for the convenience and closeness to me. They lose a 1/2 star because its at Metrocenter, BAH! Stop giving money away where it's not necessary to, and just say "Shut up and take my money!"

Holy river rats Batman!!! How have I not done a review for my beloved SRT?!?! Lets change that.... Sploosh!  ~What to do~ You float down a river for as long as 6 full hours. Its brilliant. For such a simple thing as floating down a slow-moving river, there are a bevvy of activities to do....  ~The Good~ You have the ability to get such a large group together, it is wonderful to hang with friends and simply chill for the entire day. Floating down the river for up to about 6 hours, anything can happen. The camaraderie is so well versed here, you meet so many people randomly, it really is a big party. There is also so much to do, like hitting others with over sized marshmallows and not potentially getting murdered. You can also be a pirate, and not be considered mental. You can drink to excess and not be considered awkward and creepy while being drunk in public (within reason). In all seriousness, it really is a ton of fun. There are a lot of unwritten rules that tubers must abide by, I will cover some later, but this is a floating party....its a ton of fun. There is nothing like it out here, and any summer is incomplete without getting the gang together and swashbuckling on the river. The lead up to the day and getting the supplies ready for the big day is so much fun!  ~The Bad~ Being a floating party, you have the drunks just like you'd expect. They can get rowdy, and stupid. If you are a party animal, you best have some good friends that know how to keep you in check. Otherwise, you may be floating at the bottom of the river and be as good as a rock you may encounter. Oh that's another thing, the rocks. People whom aren't expecting a river rapids to have some rocks will be mistaken when their tube encounters them. If you bring a cooler, you better hold on to it for dear life when going down each rapid, or your beers will go bye bye when it hits a rock. Hearing stories of lost keys and items is a common occurrence, but all these "bad" points are easily avoidable if you have a brain and use common sense/ask questions to veteran river-riders. The water can get pretty nasty, don't drink it. The water is cold, as expected. The sun beats down on you, as expected...are any of these really bad? Not really, if you....have a brain :-) Be open and don't be such a turtle in your shell or conservative, or just simply keep away from the river all-together.  ~The Down Low~ Ok, so some simple things to remember: - Don't bring your kids, they do not belong here. The cut-off age I say is 13-15 years old, and that's if your group is filled with upstanding citizens.  -Weekends are the busiest days, yet more fun with more people to float around with.  -Get extra bags at the front to put trash in, don't litter.  -Bring extra water if drinking, or you will be dehydrated and risk hurting yourself...and ALWAYS a DD, no Q's asked. -I suggest tying tubes together, despite what SRT says. It keeps the pack together.. If you have a huge group, then maybe break it up into smaller groups, but especially tie up your cooler so you can keep tabs on it...so, in other words: BRING ROPE! -Remember to grab from your closet some items, like bed sheets to put over your tube, or else you will burn yourself. Bring water shoes/old shoes you don't care much about. Do not dress to impress, keep favorite clothes AWAY from the river.  -Tie your keys to yourself, unless you have a secure pocket which will not open up.  -Remember to continuously apply sunscreen, don't stop or you will burn to a crisp.  -Finally, bring a bag of marshmallows, its a ton of fun and everyone does it. I suggest one bag per person, but that's your choice.   All in all, any downside the river has is significantly negated by common sense and preparedness. For that, and for the fact that the river is unlike anything in the valley, I rate it 5 stars. If you are from out of town, this is a must-go if you want to get away from the heat. Just remember the tips, and you will love it.

Wow. This place is superb. It is hard to notice it if you are driving by, and unless you take the leap in and just go for it, you would think its a dive... Oh, but Papago is hardly that!  ~Fud/Drink On my second visit, I had the Orange Blossom beer. I didn't have it the first time, because I was an idiot. Being a non-idiot, I quickly ordered a pint, which subsequently went into my belly super quick. This is my personal favorite beer, no question about it. It is refreshing, yet smooth, has no bite or acidic after taste, and is great by itself or with a dish. Speaking of dishes, they make some mighty tasty bar food. I had a pizza on the first visit, which filled me up and was exceptional. On the most recent visit, I had the red pepper hummus, which surprised me in its above-par flavor. There is a variety of dishes available, all which will fill you up and give your beer a good stomach-fellow. They have so many beers on tap, you would be a fool not to find at least one that suits your fancy. This is a must-go for any beer fan, you will be very satisfied with the options in front of you.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Like I said, it seemed at first like a dive, being in a strip center without much signage, minus the outside glass job they did to the store-front. Inside is a lot of wood, which gives you the feel for an old-school bar and a Midwestern  feel. It feels inviting, and there more than enough space for you and some friends to chill at. There is also a side room I did not notice until now, that is available if there is a large crowd, so space issues aren't a concern. As for service, it seems to be about average. After waiting about 4 minutes for a server to come to me I simply walked up and ordered instead of waiting and getting upset. Eventually a seat opened up at the bar and the server helped me when I asked for another type of beer. They seem a bit busy, so you do have to ask for their attention. The waitstaff aren't rude, they just seem semi-attentive. I will service gauge this a bit more as I continue to come back. Overall, I am satisfied :)  ~Extras/Rating~ I must suggest finding a seat at the bar if you are coming with another friend. It seems to mean much quicker service and also gives you an idea about selection of beers of course. Please also note the HUGE selection of carry-out beers they have in front of the bar itself. A huge huge selection, which is great if you are not near a Total Wine but want to select your own craft beer six pack. The bonus over Total Wine is that they are all cold! One sad downside is that they only serve the Orange Blossom in a Growler, no six pack avail for any of their beers. Oh well! Five Stars goes out to this place for the quality beers, inviting atmosphere, the tasty bar food that tastes fresh,  the large selection of take out beers, and for the best beer of them all: The Orange Blossom! This is the best brewery I have been to in AZ, its to be determined if another one can carry the weight that Papago has. Come and enjoy!

Discount Tire is the bees knees. Always has been. Always will. Why?  * Best prices I can find. I am super frugal, and they do the job right. * Best customer service. Kind, not pushy, personable and quick. * Quality Products. Always get what I need from them. Even if I am paying less than other places, the tires I get here are not crap. * Their Tire Warranty Program rocks. Been using them for around 7 years now on all my cars, and have had numerous tire issues. I have saved probably just south of 1K on tires using their warranty program. Take that nails on the ground!  Speaking of customer service, Donald today kicked ass. I was having issues with my new Honda CRV and it's warning light. I thought it was low tire pressure (I was right) but Donald went out of his way to quickly check to make sure it wasn't an operational issue. I told him I got the car, I was unaware of the tire life (never can trust the dealer) and wanted price quotes for future tires in stock.  Donald quickly checked tire pressure on each tire and let me know I had a good 1 1/2 years left on my tires. They needed air, to go around the back to get free air. These tires are not with Discount folks. Free air for non-Discount tires! We ran inside and checked out prices for my tires, which were actually waaaay cheaper than I was expecting for an SUV. I will gladly pay for longer-life tires here, knowing the prices now. I went around the back, got my tires pumped up by another gentleman who informed me it was a good thing I came in. About 3 minutes after driving out of the lot (I paid them nothing other than thanks) the light went off, saving me time and money for diagnosis at a dealer.  I can't recommend or suggest another tire place any more higher than I can here. They get the job done right, every time. Never once have I had an issue with any location. This is one business model built on consistency that works. Ownership should be proud that they have built a sustainable business model based on discount priced goods. I will always be a customer, and if you are getting your tires from a dealer you are probably paying too much unless you know someone....plus you probably aren't given a life-time tire warranty. Stop wasting your money and use Discount! 5 stars to infinity!

*First, I have to get this off my chest. I am a consistent patron of this sushi bar, and it gets annoying seeing so many people give flack to Sushi 101. I have brought many a friend here, and it's created many sushi lovers....Believe me, I am a witness! Is it the highest quality fine grade-A sushi you will ever have? No. Can I say this is the best place for sushi, don't go anywhere else? NO! Is it an amazing and price-efficient way to learn how to sushi, and let you try things before you branch out? YES! As a foodie, a native Phoenician and a proud Sun Devil Alumni, I definitely take issue to those who cast patrons off as slack-jawed kids.*  OK, I feel better. The 101 is a treat if you are a Sun Devil or even a local Tempe resident. They have all the generic types of sushi and have some of the best happy hour deals in town. I can't tell you how great it feels to know you can get a big ol' Sake Bomb with your friends and not freak out about prices. You get what you pay at happy hour, which they have two of. It allows everyone ample time to get out and enjoy their sushi at a good price. Also, one thing rarely utilized here is their lunch specials, which are amazing. I took advantage of this once, and if you think the deals at happy hour are good, their bento boxes are killer.    The quality is where 101 takes its flack, and rightfully so. But for the most part besides a couple dishes (mainly spicy salmon), you should expect to have excellent tasting sushi The special rolls they make are also great, and can play to a variety of pallets.   For these deals, I give it 4 stars. Its probably more deserving of 3 1/2 *'s, considering quality, but adding in the amount of daily happy hour considering other local sushi restaurants, this takes the cake. I definitely suggest you branch out besides here, we do have some great sushi bars here in AZ, but this is an awesome deal if you're in the Tempe area and want some sushi.

First off, I am not Vegan....not even slightly. I love myself a good slice of fish or some wholesome chicken like the next guy. However, I have shifted my lifestyle choices recently to a more healthy overall track. So keep that in mind when reading forward.  Green is the first "mock" food joint I have ever eaten at. Considering the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I took my fiance over here to check it out. We both were cautiously optimistic about the abundance of options on the menu. Laura (my fiance) chose a mock meatball spaghetti, the Orecciette pasta. The mock meatballs tasted more like falafel than meat, however the sauce and earlobe pasta was amazing. Also added in were the veggies within the pasta....overall she really chose an awesome dish.  I chose the seemingly popular Original "g" spicy po-boy sandwich, with curry pasta. Biting into the mock chicken, you could tell it was not real chicken per say..its obvious. BUT, the amazingly tasty flavors along with the buffalo sauce just run rampantly on your taste buds. The curry pasta I got as my side was as good, if not better than the sandwich itself...I could eat that curry pasta all day.  So, with that said, two dishes tried, both tasted AMAZING. You can tell the food is not real, but does it matter when the food tastes so great? I'll answer that for you with a resounding no...no it doesn't matter. It gets 5 stars just for the fact that the culinary experience may be different, but the end result is significant satisfaction on multiple levels. Think about it:  its great for you, the soy products within are amazingly healthy and everything is organic for the most part when you eat here. I will definitely be making plans to set aside a few $'s just for a "Green Fund" so I can eat here at least a couple times a month. Will re-post when I try something else...perhaps the pizza??? Will update soon!!!

ASU Gammage really is a fun place for events. The event planner here, really has the upper hand over all other sites in town...ALL of the best Broadway acts seem to come here each year. ASU Gammage has embedded in my head the fact that they are the main place to see an Off-Broadway production in Phoenix.  ~What to Do~ Gammage hosts a variety of acts, everything between significant Off-Broadway productions (Les Miserables, Rent, etc..) to musical acts of numerous ranges. The center is also built to house numerous public/private events.  ~The Good~ I am a very big history nerd. I gobble it up. So I appreciate it when history not only is able to be viewed, but is functioning to this day. The history alone is worth a trip to see the place. Built many moons ago in 1964, this was considered to be the last grand-scale project completed by Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1985, it was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places...its a piece of American history!! FLW built the auditorium to assist with quick and easy dispersal of people from their seats for intermissions and shows. If you notice, it is very fast and simple to exit the auditorium, and the aisles are big enough that you barely have to move your legs to let someone pass by. Might I add the staff are always friendly and helpful? Well, they are!   The sight-lines are very good even for balcony seats. Also, although it goes fast, they do offer free parking all around the area..or its about $6 to park around town...that's not bad in comparison to numerous other cities and their parking policies..we have it a bit easy here in Arizona, parking is always cheap :-D. Finally, the place is a 2 minute walk from the beginning of the Mill Avenue District, so I must add Location Location Location!!!  ~The Bad~ Its old...I mean, it was built in 1964 for crying out loud. Seats aren't overtly comfortable as they are at say, the Phoenix Symphony. The balcony seats can be a tad further back, you can hear well, but sight lines get more difficult the further up you go. Parking, since it is free, goes very quickly. If you have an aversion for walking, then perhaps take a cab, because I always end up walking 5+ minutes. I do not mind it, but I do know many do.   ~The Down Low~ They get 5 stars because of the upper hand for scheduling shows, location of site, friendly staff, History of site, and ease of use in facility (crowd flow, refreshments, etc). Help yourself to amazing upcoming shows. I am planning on getting a mini-pack of tickets for the season because the shows are that good! Enjoy the show!

Kiwanis has everything a rec center needs to be considered one of the best. Right to the point, if you ask me. I'll cover it all, but regardless of age, they have all the bases covered. Lets dive into Kiwanis (we can dive into the wave pool later!)  ~What To Do~ What can't you do? If you are a child, they offer sports classes up the ying yang like the non-competitive program Sportball all the way to fun swimming classes in the huge pool, no matter the skill level. For adults, the tennis courts are outstanding, as is the fitness room too! Finally, for the older crowd, they have many fun programs available for you to stay active and happy!  ~The Good~ I really feel that to be a true RECREATION center, you have to be able to provide a large variety of programming for the masses. Kiwanis, in my eyes, offers just that and more. They offer the largest variety of programming I have found in the valley. With me personally being a sports coach, I have been to many city rec centers, and no center is the same. This center is at the top of the food chain. They also offer a batting range, A BATTING RANGE. Do this equation: Batting Range + Wave Pool + Gym + Tennis Courts + Awesome Staff = Bonkers Good Facility. Just stop by with your child, sit down to the left and look through their program guide....you will see the breadth of their course offerings..then you will see the huge wave pool behind the desk and be sold!  ~The Bad~ It is an older facility, and being so, there are some visible areas where they could do some minor renovations. However they just re-did the bathrooms and also touched up the walking areas near the softball fields, so you can't say they aren't trying. My biggest complaint is parking, which is situated in bulk on the opposite sides of the center. It makes for a relatively long walk no matter which side you park on. They have a minor row of parking right up front, however if you come anytime really after open on a weekend, don't bother trying to find a spot up front. In the hot summer months, that can be a bit of a nuisance, but really that is worst it gets here....parking... haha :-)  ~The Down Low~ This is my favorite center to teach at. I prefer it over all others. It is the largest, has more options than others, has spacious grass to frolic on (I said 'frolic' in a review, life is complete now), and the staff here are extremely helpful and courteous each time I converse with them. Like I said earlier, just come down and grab a pamphlet with programming info, you will be very happy. Message me if you have questions about programming, I am glad to help!!!

Jobing.Com is by far the best arena in this state. There, I said it. The experience is not even close to the other arenas. We do not have many, but it far exceeds anything we've built based on basic purpose.   This place has amazing acoustics, by the way. Lets just point that out. It should get more music acts, and historically they've had some insanely big names and events. Paul McCartney comes to mind as the biggest. There is not a bad seat in the house, seriously. The sight-lines are amazing, when they built this place they obviously had in mind the fan, and the fact that we prefer to sit anywhere and have a good view.   Food options at the site are plentiful, I won't down the prices because its an arena, expect to pay a lot. I think the one place that sets them apart is the Boars Head sandwich shop on the lower level. Great idea! They serve up some amazingly tasty sandwiches. They have a couple beer stations in select spots for premium beers and drinks which is awesome. Customer service has never been needed, but they are always courteous as I walk by.  As for the team, come on guys. You can't give this place a bad rating for the way the management of the team goes. Everyone knows this place should have been built in Scottsdale. It wouldn't been the crowning achievement for the area, and we would have been better off for it. Sadly that never happened. That's besides the point. This place is amazing. The fans that do go actually enjoy hockey and understand the game. Hockey has been in the valley since the 60's, despite many people not understanding this fact at all... Sadly it might not last longer.   I love this arena, its a ways away from where I live but I truly care for it and love sitting down for a game. I consider it one of the nicest arenas i have been in, and when its filled, it gets louuuud! Go Yotes!

Penn & Teller put on a spectacular show. I enjoy how they truly care about making us involved with the act, on top of their interest in us not being duped by other performers out there.  ~The Good~ They seem to provide a variety of their acts, both new and old. The acts are anything but "grand" as far as scale of size, but they pack so much punch. The "Fish in Punchbowl" act was my personal favorite, and despite a disturbance in the audience (a young boy fainted) Teller was unfazed and went on once the coast was clear. The insight into how some trick are set up to fool me and others was very interesting, as was general tricks showing both Penn and Teller's amazing skills of slight. Not a bad seat in the house, a lot of audience interaction. Simply one of my favorite shows I have been to  ~The Bad~ Barely anything to complain about. These guys are funny as can be. They are funny because unlike other performers, they do talk a lot. A lot. You better expect it, or you will be left saying "Penn talked my head off! Blaw blaw blaw...!" They also, like I pointed out, do not do humungous tricks, so keep this in mind when you are choosing to see them or not. If you want to be mystified by amazing feats of physical and spiritual, go see Criss Angel!  ~The Down Low~ 5 stars goes to this show for their creativity/sincerity, great sight lines, audience interaction,  Comedic takes and expertise. Might I add that you should get tickets close to the exit. Why? Because at the end of each show, Penn and Teller haul ass outside to greet everyone and take pictures (pictures to come soon). They are gracious hosts, and understand and appreciate the fact that you paid $$ to see them. This is an A+ show and has been around for over a decade. You can point this out when someone asks if they are good or not...or if it is worth the money. Go see the show, they will make you think about magic and sleight of hand, plus you will laugh your pants off.

Wow. I am absolutely floored by all the hate this place is getting. This is the main hotel-casino I have stayed at when I come to Vegas. Never had an issue. I've come and stayed about 4 separate occasions. No issues to note.  I am not high maintenance, so maybe some people here rating so low need to just relax a bit... Just saying.   As for Luxor, they provide unbeatable rates for me since I am comped in their M-Life program. I am not a high roller, nor do I gamble. But despite this, they still give me amazing rates with the free membership. Now, please enjoy my  frugal, money-conscious side as it kicks in.  Why on Earth would you spend hundreds of dollars per night for a room when you can get a solid quality room for a fraction of the price....One that you rarely stay in while in Vegas. That's all I have to say, because there are quality rooms here at the Luxor for quality rates, you just have to do your research. If you are lazy, you will overspend each time you step out of your room in Vegas.  The M-Life program spans many hotels other than Luxor, so its a great program to enjoy. It reaches multiple properties, and they share different rate options which will save a lot of green in the end. I use it for everything, and it makes my stays here at the Luxor great. Many things inside are solid, not flashy. Like the buffet downstairs. It doesn't blow you away, but it delivers. Its on par with most of the nicer resort buffets you could go to in town considering price, etc.. Also, the parking is not too far away, so I simply can park and go as I please, even if I am at the end of the strip. Oddly enough, the inside smells of coconut, does anyone else notice this? I love it, and I have no idea why....Its just a little nuance they have, and its awesome.  Its a give/take when it comes to exhibits and shows. That has been, and will continue to be the major downfall for the Luxor. The shows here are not great, so that's a major hit to their rating on my end. Carrot Top, he's lame. And I hate magic, its not magic. Inception. Sploosh. And a Menopause musical? REALLY?!?! The only saving grace for entertainment are the exhibits. They are amazing. The Titanic exhibit is a must see, it doesn't matter where you are staying, you must go. Bodies is also a great snag for them to have for the next few years. Very interesting, and makes you think before you go smoking while out on the casino floor. So within reason, these both balance out their ratings to a point. I am not a gambler, so unless I get free points I rarely gamble. Therefore its a wash, haha.  Maybe some people should take advantage of those rates and re-rate Luxor. I think they would see the advantages of giving a place a second chance. Although there are many many better options for entertainment down the strip, this place delivers quality, not pizazz or flash with high prices. Come here to stay, have some awesome alcoholic smoothies, and gamble a bit... It gets 4 stars because I never have been screwed with once here, although given the entertainment downsides I'd say its more representative of a 3 /12.... Either way, I plan on coming here each time, and saving money as I do.

I am going to gush about this place....sorry...I might go overboard, sue me. I absolutely love Caffe Boa. This is NOT associated with the one on Mill. Please disregard them when comparing the two. Its apples and oranges. This site does not get barely enough pub, which is truly a damn shame. Well, lets change that!  ~Fud/Drink~ I have attended here a couple times. Each time, the food has been exquisite. No other way to put it. Their take on European-American values along with their blended emphasis on using local and sustainable foods, they do it perfectly. Last time we went was for Valentines Day 2012, and I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. It is hard to explain how beautiful the flavors were in this dish. They crashed in my mouth and unleashed flavors I haven't tasted in many years. I tried a bit of my fiance's beef dish, and was floored at the tenderness and flavor as well. The management tends to include many new options from time to time, so when you stop in after a while, expect to see new options that taste great. The wines here are paired perfectly for the foods on the menu. They also place such a fine emphasis on sustainability with their wines, by the way. They have a wide variety as you would expect. The owner makes sure to keep up with his stock and changes it up from time to time in turn with his menu. Finally, everyone loves the different desserts on the menu, its just not my thing. But from everything I have heard, they are just as good as the dishes that you just ate. The chef here has perfected the more elegant sides of a Euro-American dish, it is such a pleasure to eat here.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Sterling S. is spot on with the ambiance. I say awesome too much in my reviews, so he said it more me. Tucked inside of this small venue is a beautiful room and patio which is intimate and inviting. I highly suggest this spot anytime you need to take your special someone out for a extra-special night. The waitstaff are also spot-on. I haven't had a single bad experience with anyone here. They treat you very well, and seem to have ESP...because they come back at the right time. If I have a question about something on our bill, they take the time to answer my Questions, and do not huff if I ask for help splitting a portion of the bill. As with any fine-dining establishment, they are highly knowledgeable of their menu, but they also keep a keen tab on the wines as well. Ask them for a good wine to pair your dish with, and they will have an answer.   ~Extras/Rating~ I have a couple things to note. They do have mid-afternoon happy hour specials on food and drinks.They also have enough area on the patio outside to offer live music from time to time. The live music is always paired well with the quiet interior, and sets the mood well. Finally, they offer every few months a specific wine/food event, normally wine-related. They update their website from time to time for these events, but I suggest you call ahead of time to see what is going on that day/week and in the future. They get a 5 star rating because of the high quality food, enchanting service and ambiance, variety of events, and the general charm the site exudes. I can't think of a finer food establishment in Ahwatukee, its a gem.

Izzy is amazing. Hands down the best barber I have been to in my 28 years of life. Why? Because he has "it". He has the cojones to say "let me show you why I always get *expletive* Yelps." He knows what he is doing, and has got a swagger that pushes him along. I love it.  Here comes me, all 5'5'' of my little frame bumbling into his shop. Izzy is sitting back in his chair waiting for the next customer, a very good looking young woman by his side. No frills here. He has chairs everywhere and 3 tv's. Simple. He asks me to sit down and I sloppily explain that for years I have gotten horrible hair cuts, and am taking advice left and right on Jefe's Back In The World Tour 2014. Advice includes a new beard along with a new hair style, lol.   Izzy laughs at my sad hair history. It was a bit deflating, but then again I laughed internally as well. I did myself wrong. I told him I was looking at something short, maybe a fade...did not have specific numbers. He could sense I was grasping at straws and then took over. "I am going to get you cut that gets you noticed from across the room", he said confidently. He then proceeded to man-talk with me a bit......not appropriate for this review, lol. This guy exudes confidence in each stroke of his clippers folks. After the initial cut he did a hot foam on my neck and around the ears and straigh-razor shaped my neckline and ears. Precision cut, boys.  After he clipped Jefe up, that pretty woman actually became an assistant. She took me to the sink and washed out my hair with shampoo. Did a nice scalp massage, followed by a great 3 minute massage. Simple and relaxing overall experience. Then I came back to Izzy who threw some damn good smelling product in my hair. Its his shop's main stuff, and I love it....And that was it! 30 minutes in there and I went from a schmuck who had no clue what he was talking  You may be asking, what did he make me into? What did the cut look like? Well, he ended up giving me a modified flat top, 2 on the sides, messy on top (check out the pictures). Damn good cut. He used shears on the top to messy it up, which I loved. He demanded I do myself good and come in every 3-4 weeks. He doesn't charge much, $15 for the entire experience. I would say this is a $25 cut at a more established joint.  He gets 5 stars....2 alone for the confidence he brings to his cuts. No wishy washy attitude. Another star for his craftmanship, one for the amenities included in the cut, and finally the quality of the product based on price. Overall great experience. I have finally found a barber who has the balls to help me and take ownership of their cuts. Never looking back, I am a Brooklyn man now. Boys, jump in line and do the same!

Sweet God have mercy. There really is nothing to say about Metrocenter that hasn't been said a million times. But personally, I love this place....this empty space of a place. Lets slowly creep and look behind your back as we review Metrocenter...  ~What To Do~ WELL... there used to be a lot more. Ruby Tuesdays is gone, so no flagship restaurant is housed here. The arcade has been long long long gone, as is the ancient and forgotten ice rink. There are some shops, the typical ones you expect at a mall this size. There is also a Harkins at the main entrance, it is a fairly large Harkins, compared to some in the area.  ~The Good~ Honestly, there is very little. The best thing about Metro is the Dillards Clearance Center. A clearance center....that's the nicest thing. I love this Dillards, and I shop here exclusively for my super nice clothes. The cheapest bargains in the state are at this store....Just come here and dig in! The two last anchor tenants left are Macy's, located centrally within the mall, and Sears. Most of the stores have great sales year long, at almost outlet store prices, mainly aimed at driving in some resemblance of a crowd. They have some other outlet style stores with good prices you do not see at other locations as well...  ~The Bad~ *Scratches head*. ..... WHERE, oh where, sweet little unborn baby Jesus, should I start? I could start with the evident lack of oversight of this once pristine mall in North Phoenix. I could discuss how the consistent miscalculations of management derailed my favorite mall in my neighborhood. I could discuss how the last true department stores, Macy's and Sears, are clearly not hitting their numbers each month...its obvious. The food court is just sad, and I am not a food court guru. They have a sushi place, that is awesome....but holy hell, not one big-time chain that makes me remotely interested in eating. There are nicer movie theaters on other parts of town, and I choose to go there since the entertainment is better there as well. Of the tenants that are here, a couple are hawking cheap merchandise, one sports store is selling off old Glass Cage Sports merchandise (just look at the tags).. Its the epitome of a (insert expletive)-mess. It's actually embarrassing to say this was MY mall. I took pride in this place. Store after store after store have left, and I see none of them coming back. Its just as bad across the street, where Best Buy left many moons ago, and within the past few years Sports authority followed suit. Sports Chalet just left too. It makes me depressed, actually.....a mall, makes me depressed. It's sad, guys. Metro is shell of itself.  ~The Downlow~ You know what this mall reminds me of? It reminds of the 9-digit disaster called the "Scottsdale Galleria". Remember it?!?! With the state of the art IMAX!?! Albeit, the Galleria lasted nowhere near as long as here, but its the premise of being an unused hulk. Metro in a sense is now the primary "White Elephant" in Phoenix. It just stands there, a shell of itself. I suggest coming here explicitly for Dillard's shopping center, they get one lone star for the Dillard's Center, it is outstanding! Maybe catch a movie too, the Harkins isn't the worst in the valley, its just in a wretched spot. Besides that, I am at a loss for words. Its just sad. So yea, come for those two things, enjoy the day hunting for bargains. Other than that, just pray someone has a chance to figure out a way to get this monolith bustling again...if that's even possible.

Oh.... Wildflower. If I could marry you I would, but my fiance would...not...approve....  Where do I start? Everything about Wildflower is awesome. Every location I ever have been to, has been SO CONSISTENT, it is unreal. I can go to the location out in Prescott and enjoy the same friendly service and amazing food that they offer at this awesome location (I chose this one because its closer to me). I finally realize its becoming a chain, but they haven't sacrificed any quality since their expansion.   I can't really recommend anything specifically on the menu, it is all so damn good. Really, I can't, and yes I know this is a review so I should have an opinion....Ok, honestly, I guess if you break my wrist for some more info I see their breakfast as the strongest portion of the menu, but I could be off when I make this assumption. I love the pancakes the most.   Random, right? : Pancakes....simple, easy, I could make them at home (lies...I'd burn them). They have a banana nut pancake which is tubular (1 point for Jefe for the usage of tubular). I have had a lot on each menu, but the options for breakfast out-class most eateries in town. Even the bathrooms are clean and friendly....yes, I just jumped from pancakes to bathrooms. Deal with it.  Come here and enjoy the food, no matter what time of the day. You will not be disappointed.

So....This place is great. I take our Yorkie as well as my parents 4 year old Cocker Spaniel from time to time and try to go to the park at least 4+ times a month. Although we know we should take him more, we live in Central Phoenix, and its a good 20 minute drive. However, the 20 minute drive is WELL WORTH the satisfaction we get  with yet another great Scottsdale park.   This park has a lot of room compared to other dog parks, but its main calling card is this: DOGS ARE ALWAYS HERE! Unless you come there when its 120 out, people bring their dogs here. And these dogs, they aren't bad ones for the most part.   We always go to the "Passive" side, which makes sense considering we have a very social little Yorkie and an at times aloof Cocker. They love the interaction and there is just enough space to make them feel like they are at an animal preserve. The dogs are well behaved and all the owners we talk to are pleasant and share the same interests we do in dogs. We always seem to get pleasant convo, along with our dogs whom at this point start barking in joy as we turn in to the parking lot.   I did recently bring a dog we're sitting over to the "Active" side, and it is a major difference. We are watching after a hulkiish 9 month old puppy, who is rambunctious as could be. Needless to say, he fit in pretty well. I'll definitely bring him back, he enjoyed it, but for the most part, each dog is much bigger, faster and aggressive than the more passive side, as is expected. He is very submissive to the older, stronger dogs, which threw me off for a bit. If your dog is like this, please do expect at least one or two dogs to get a bit rowdy with yours on this side.   We love this park, and unless a much better option pops up in our vicinity in the near future (doubt it) we will only take our dogs to this park  * Btw, as far as my rating goes, this is the best park I have been to, although with a couple changes it could be the best park (and more!). I must like 4 stars, as I seem to only dole out 4 star reviews, save for a few. This is a good park, but there are always bits and pieces they could add or change up. Oh well, just a random observation.

Feeney's is a tradition in my family...It is my mom's favorite place to grab a bite. Let chomp down and Opa Opa Opa at Feeneys..  ~The Good~ Service. Hooo boy, the service. As soon as you walk in its like your family is welcoming you in. I am not a big "don't touch me bro" kinda guy, but the hostess (and I presume owner) is a sweetheart. She took me by the shoulder, made me feel amazing and took me to my table. I had a bunch of flowers for my mother and she made sure I got a big pitcher of water to dunk them in. I did not ask but she was persistent I needed the pitcher. Now its one thing if the service is great, but its another if they provide smiles but crap food...not here.  I got the Pan Fried trout in Lemon Caper Sauce...out of this world. I rarely get fried foods, but it wasn't drenched in oil. The sauce was a bit salty adding the capers in, and really meshed well with the trout. I will try my damnedest to replicate that recipe now. I love trout, and boy did they hit a home run. The salad bar which is attached with almost all meals here also hit the spot and was delicious. Happy hour was available, with almost all drinks being 3 bucks, including wine and well drinks. I got some Cabernet, which tasted about right, not bad, not amazing, just right for the dinner I had.   As for the ambiance and mood, I love it. Quiet and comfy, the lights are perennially dimmed, creating a cozy atmosphere. The staff who are quick to refill drinks and always helpful keep the ambiance rolling strong. I also like the slight hints towards Greece on both their menu and on the murals inside. Very much an independently owned restaurant vibe, which as you know well I really really dig.  Finally, their menu is eclectic, especially seafood. They have 4 seperate fishes on their main menu at any time: Pike, Trout, Salmon, Orange Roughy. That's pretty damn good for a small mom and pop place. They fly the Pike in directly from the lakes of Minnesota fresh, which is great. Overall, strong food selection as well outside of seafood, with dishes like Beef Wellington and London Broil to note.   ~The Bad~ Its an older location gang. You see all the reviews mentioning the former tenants and such. You can go outside, look at the roof and notice its older right away. Inside the walls are mainly filled with murals and it is dimly lit. Some people may not like this set up...actually I know a ton of people who hate any place relatively quaint and dark like this. Too bad for you. Also the prices are a bit high...$17.99 for my trout dinner? A bit much. They have to make their money somehow, and fish spoils quickly so I get it...but still, for trout? Oh well, thats my only real gripe.  ~The Downlow~ I saved the best for last: Their Happy Hour. This place has a spectacular happy hour guys. Every day is a new food special, so you never will go a day without a real kick ass special. Some days it isn't a price special, but a different food item. For example they had Walleye Dynamite the other day, which my father said was very good. Their Tuesday (I believe) Burger Special is especially of note...very inexpensive.  They get 4 stars for strong service, quaint ambiance, Great Happy Hours/Daily Specials, and a good selection on the menu.  Enjoy a Phoenix tradition and stop by Feeney's!

Sprouts in one sentence: "Sprouts is a necessary spot for niche items that even Trader Joes does not handle or carry." Pow! Pow! Lets delve into this spot specifically, off of Indian School.  ~What to do?~ Couches....lots of couches.. Kidding. It is a classier chain grocery store, specializing primarily in foods and health items.   ~The Good~ I compare them directly to Trader Joe's, being they are a specialty grocery chain. If you are new to the valley, this is the best way to gauge the options you will find when stopping in for the first time. It is and will always be my my # 1 store to hit for necessary recipe items. The store carries a wide range of spices that are pourable from a spout. Generally they are priced by the ounce, or whichever measuring medium used on the spice's label. It's amazingly easy when making a recipe, just go to Sprouts! On top of that, they also carry a large inventory of barreled scoop-and-pay items. Everything from Split Peas to gummy bears, then more. It's a specialty grocery store that allows you to shop for specific niche items that you can't find elsewhere. Its an experience, when compared to general grocery chains . Outside of a true meat market, they carry some of the freshest meats/seafood in town that a grocery chain could provide. This is one thing that TJ's has not... a meat counter with high quality options! Finally, besides the healthy living section filled with vitamins and minerals, they also have a general produce section along with frozen foods, much alike TJ's.  ~The Bad~ They are always a bit pricier than other spots in town, very comparable to TJ's. This is where once again that comparison will help you. It is pricier to shop here for your primary grocery list. Its best to gauge the weekly specials and to see what items are on sale, which is straining but will save you a lot in the end. They do not have many household products like at a grocery chain, but that's not the primary reason to come here anyway.  ~Extras/Rating~ On Wednesdays, they come out with the next week's special sales. This also coincides with the closure of the previous weeks' specials. Thus, you have twice the specials on Wednesdays!! This is the best day to shop here, so much is on sale! Take a look at the frozen section, they have some interesting items I never even noticed... Sashimi Grade Tuna, hooray! That's just a small example of what else they have. They get 4 stars for having such an excellent healthy selection of foods. The prices drag them down one star, but you can't haggle with prices too much when you see the selection and quality you get here. This location has wonderful, fast service, and will always do you well. Enjoy food shoppers!

I am definitely a fan. Unfortunately I no longer hail in Gilbert, but this is an outstanding treat tucked in old-town Gilbert. I've been a couple times and the traditional breakfast options along with different mixes make this spot a must-go if you are in the area...  ~Fud/Drinks~ This small house packs in large crowds, especially on the weekends. Why? Because of the food. They do not have amazingly complex dishes, but the dishes each pop with flavor in your mouth. I am an egg whites kinda guy, and their egg-white omelets lack 0 flavor. If you enjoy breakfast they will be able to serve your hunger pangs. The variety of options is just perfect and allows someone to sit down and pick and choose on each visit. The site has all the traditional fresh juices and the coffee is crisp. Everything simply tastes fresh and cooked to order. There are no bland or run-of-the-mill flavors come out of the kitchen.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ This is where they run away with the rating stars. The charming farmhouse you sit in is quaint and is almost too perfect of a setting..if that's possible. You feel right at home sitting with your family around the table, despite cramped quarters. Yes the seating is tight, but that's part of the ambiance, is it not? It's not cramped to the point of suffocation, lets just leave it at that. The servers are attentive and keep up with your table. When it gets busier, of course they come less, but that's expected at a popular breakfast spot. The owner seems to always be there, helping her staff. She also walks around and helps out with the food service as well, adding to the ambiance and knowledge of the menu. It's nice knowing that she is this involved with her restaurant.  ~Extras/Rating~ Being that it is a smaller capacity spot, its almost a shoe-in that you will need to put yourself on a wait list if you do not come a bit early. On weekends during peak hours mid-morning, I would suggest coming at least 20+ minutes prior to when you want to be seated. Otherwise, you might get disappointed with having to wait so long. Also, remember, during the summer you might want to come earlier in the morning to eat. Being a older facility there is not much solace in the heat on their outside porch, minus the breeze. Old town Gilbert is getting constantly renovated, its a fun spot to go to and explore on a weekend. This is a great starting point for a family weekend day. Lastly, do try the cinnamon roll if you enjoy desserts. It is absolutely scrumptious and delightful. It blows other rolls out of the water! ENJOY!

Loyalty...It means a lot. I am loyal to homegrown Harkins! Many forget that Harkins was started here in Arizona and for many years fought hard against the competitors to make it to where they are at. This Cine Capri location might be the nicest one built yet, and is well maintained by fast and effective staff.  ~What to do?~ See movies, lots and lots of movies. You also will see from time to time special events held here.  ~The Good~ The way Harkins pays attention to the customer is unparalleled in the movie industry. The drink and shirt deals is an extra incentive to have us come to the movies more, thus helping both the movie house and the customer. The popcorn dust stand isn't offered in AMC theaters...too bad for them. The staff at this location are very fast, and take care of you quickly to get your butt in a seat. The CIne Capri is huge, the seats are comfy and there is not a bad seat in the house, aside from the front rows. This location is kept very clean, the cleaning crews are quick to act as movies end. The bathrooms are also fairly clean, and there are enough that overcrowding isn't a big issue. Also, this location is perfect, right at Tempe Marketplace. The mall would not be the same without this awesome theater here. Plus there are so many screens here that they offer many start times, which allows you to pick and choose times wisely.  ~The Bad~ With most theaters there is the issue with overcrowding when a new movie comes out. Many people target this spot for new releases, so its wise to get there early to see the new flick you want to see. They may have a lot of screens and the Cine Capri, but it still has issues with getting sold out quickly for new movies, just heed that warning. There are also a lot of kids who go out to this theater, so at times the crowd will be noisier than other locations due to the amount of children in the audience....except if its an R rated show haha. Its nowhere near as bad as Arizona Mills' crowds, just to make a point of reference  ~Extra's/Rating~ Its always fun to walk around before or after your movie, its an awesome environment at Tempe Marketplace. This theater is the best in town and gets 5 stars for the large variety of show times coupled with the atmosphere of Tempe Marketplace itself and the strong service of the employees and management team at Harkins. Never have had a bad experience, and not expecting one anytime soon!

Malls, they are a changin!! As with the bulk of malls nationwide, this one is no different: S*** is getting real son. No longer are places making money. More and more stores are closing to make room for online purchases. This place is feeling this type of issue head on....but still sucked before the recent trend of shuttering stores in favor of online began.  ~What to Do~ Shop, eat, shop, look at emo kids, shop, go to Best Buy to purchase washer, shop, eat some more, Run to Best Buy to get Dryer, do not pass go.  ~The Good~ This is yet another poorly run mall that has one awesome store: The Dillards Clearance Center. As you may already know, I love Dillards Clearance centers. For guys, you simply can't beat the deals. I went just the other day and almost got this fine 150 dollar dress shirt for 20 bucks. I need to curb my spending so I passed, but the beauty of that shirt haunts my dreams. Not as much as this mall haunts my dreams, but its a close second. Fiesta has a Dicks Sporting Goods attached to the complex as well, which is a nice boost. I love walking in there and looking at all of the over-priced goods I wish I could buy but will probably order online for cheaper. The GNC inside was nice as well, had a ton of protein bars for more than 1/2 their normal cost which helped out the ol' wallet. The one anomaly of this place is that they still have the Hollister store inside. What gives Hollister?!?! You guys are still plugging away all these years later!?! I can dig that store, God help them.  ~The Bad~ Whoever owns this property has the foresight of an 8 year old. The area around Fiesta has gotten so poor, that the shops inside are just ridiculous. It is a bigger version of Metrocenter mall, located in Mesa this time. The bulk of the stores confound me, like the ones with shirts that read "I pooped today" which obviously is a big hit to the average 15 year old out there....god help our future. There is no pomp or circumstance here, it is just a big hulk of land which does not serve a general purpose other than it is just here to walk around at.   I find myself saying this following whilst driving to Fiesta: "Oh its hot as hell! I am going to walk around Dicks, go to Dillards and walk around for a bit." Nothing...nothing makes me call this a destination. It has basic store chains that are probably grasping on to thin air in sales and are hoping customers will come. The food court is a court alright...a court of mishmashed food catastrophes. The past 5 times I have come here, each time I come somewhat hungry and say to myself "Oh lets see if something better opened up!", upon which I come to the realization that no..it hasn't. I usually leave to go to a local eatery because its too depressing to consume Japanese food at a food court in Mesa Arizona. At least Metrocenter has a relatively good sushi vendor in their "food court".   ~The Downlow~ Sweet sassy molassey, you couldn't pay me to come here on a regular basis. You should come here solely for Dillards, and if you need to comparison shop prices for sports items, shoes or clothes, go to Dicks. I prefer Dicks over other places, and would suggest that for you as well. I prefer Sports Chalet, but they are also higher priced and seem to be closing up shop around town as well. Anyway I digress. This place earns one star. One. Uno. No mas. One star for Dillards, because this place has everything I need. Do not go to Ross, Marshalls, etc for your man or yourself guys.. go to any Dillards Clearance Center and you will be in polo, dress shirt, jean and shorts heaven. Other than that, staaaaay away!!!!

I am not a pub aficionado....But, I do think I have a good understanding of what I do and do not like in a pub. Fibber's is your classic multi-faceted pub/bar that pours out great craft beers while cranking out awesome tunes. Lets have another, and review Fibber Magees.  ~Fud/Drink~ I can only really vouch for the drinks here...Just for starters. They have a very well-rounded selection of craft beers on draft from around the country that is rotated very often... I would assume more than just a seasonal rotation. Besides the crafts, they offer up all the traditional pub favorites on draft as well, my personal fav being Smithwicks. They also serve up their own special cocktails and offer a full bar, as well as a menu chocked full of traditional Irish pub food. I have had the garlic fries before, and they were OK... I have had better  (sorry Meagan B.!) Next time I am there, I will what my diet can allow me to eat, and report back with my review on the food.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Each time I have gone, I have been there when my favorite Irish Rock band "Keltic Cowboys" were playing. Being a loud band, the atmosphere was obviously a bit more upbeat. But, that tells me that this location knows how to get the place rockin' and keeps their customers happy. Different flare is located across the wall, from sprots to different Irish heritage signage. The inside is predominantly wood based, so its got that old-style bar feel, nothing contemporary to this place. It is not overtly loud when the band is not playing, however it can get crowded on busy nights, making it a tad difficult to get to the barkeeps. The bartenders are knowledgeable, and helped me pick a couple brews out when I first started trying to get into darker colored beers...So hats off to them! Service is a bit lacking, however, from the waitstaff. This is due mainly in part to the fact that they had 1 person running tables, during a show, on a SATURDAY NIGHT. That's not helping anyone...not the waitress who is trying her best, or the customers. We barely got touched during our 2+ hours there...I'd say about 3 times....that's no bueno. So note to management, get an extra body out there to help everyone out!  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, this place keeps serving me well. I really love coming here, and despite the 25+ minute drive from Phoenix, it is totally worth it when a band is playing or if you have some friends whom want to relax and kick back. I must note that they are an official Gameday location for Seahawks fans, and my UYE group will be heading over soon enough to drop in and see how the location fares. I can't wait to return to kick a couple back, sooon...sooon...

Compared to the various other cookie cutter Sushi spots, this one really stands out. The happy hour is to die for considering location and the general prices in Scottsdale. The quality of the sushi is also much different compared to general places out here. You will see that the prices at general times are very pricey for certain dishes ($15 for a seven piece roll?!?!).   One thing to point out is that this was the first time in around 2 years since i had come back. The wait staff on the last occasion were so poor that my date and I chose to leave. It seemed like a good idea, because the 20 something waitress was caught in her own bubble egregiously flirting with  five 40 year old dudes. So, to say the least, the service has gotten better than when I last went. The past few times I had gone I also was provided the typical snobby reactions that you get from wait-staff in Scottsdale. Much different this time. Our waitress was kind and understood where we were all coming from (I was in a party of 4). So at least from this time around the waitress was good.  I guess in Yelp language that would mean the service is "hit or miss", haha.  Anyway, despite the service the food is well worth any issues I have previously had. The only major hang up I won't let go is that it's truly not worth it at regular times, unless you have that type of money to go through. Sushi selection though, is top notch and this is one of my fav's when I am in the area and really craving sushi. Please try to make your first trip one to their happy hour so you can breathe a little easier when browsing the menu. If you like it, then maybe you can inch into regular hours.

Before I review, I must say that for only going once, the impression left is very strong I very much recommend Su Vino. Before even talking about wine, the customer service focus is amazing. From all the Bridal Shows my fiance and I have been to, they are always so accommodating as far as costs for event rental and the way the owner handles business is great. I am currently in charge of our wedding rehearsal dinner/party, and this is the #1 spot I have set on my list. If we go through with it, it will be a blast.   *As for our experience at the bar........*  My fiance and I went here on a Groupon about a year and a half ago. We haven't been back since. Its not our fault though, we've just been so busy.....sigh... Even without the Groupon, I would come by here, and we are planning on doing so shortly.  The wine tasting was great, and the platter we tried really added to wine pairing. Being a semi-wino, I enjoyed trying the varieties, while my fiance went right for the desert wines. Its nice to know they make in-house such a wide variety of wines for everyone to try,.   Considering the wines they make are privately made, and not "mass-produced", the bottled wine to be purchased is also quite reasonable. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance of the location lends to a relaxing chill mood, rather than a fast paced guzzle-fest or a upper class snooty wine bar. We were able to play some fun board games while sipping on wines, and we stayed for a good couple hours just taking the location in and playing games. I can't wait to come back!!!!

OK. I must update. I must. We went back a couple months ago, and I absolutely love this place. I hate seeing 4 stars from me, when I know this is my favorite place to wino-out at. Lets update, shall we?  ~Fud/Drink~ I love the appetizers they have on the menu and how they pair so well with the wines they offer. Although it is simple to pair wine and cheese and semi-upscale food together, there are still ways to fudge it up. The options they give you are relevant and easily interchangeable upon your next visit. The wines here are mind-blowing. Yes, they come from out of state, but does that matter? NO it doesn't! They grow these grapes with extreme care, ship them in here pronto, and the wine masters take care of the rest. The wines have significant flavor and volume, just like you expect. You do not miss out on value and taste, each wine is tailored for your pallet. I love my red's and they sure do stock some mighty tasty options. The Cab's and reds offered here really do have some personality that even wino's can enjoy. They also offer a large variety of sweet wines, which is a little different. It allows my fiance and others whom aren't big on traditional wines to get into it a bit. The wide variety of options for wine here makes it a great spot to run to!  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The vibe is so relaxed for a wine spot, it really is perfect for the city here. Games are available to play on the high top tables and they have extended the backroom to be available for parties and the events they hold. The atmosphere really ties the wines together well. The service has always been excellent, and each time we came with a Groupon. I would come here if they didn't have a Groupon, by the way :-).. Anyway, the service was above par even with the coupon, they have had a smile on their faces each time we came in and it never left their face when they came to serve us. Last time in we brought my mom and dad for a paired flight. My mother is a very picky wine person, and she did not like the wines much(my Dad loved them, and he is big on red's like me... go figure). Point is, the server was not taken aback by her assertions that she did not like the wines, and flawlessly provided her alternatives on the menu she would like. When she started getting uber picky, she was provided some wine's not listed on the menu which she did like, ending her random grumpiness. Our server was helpful and fast despite a busy Friday night. There was nothing more we could have asked of them, really did a stand-up job!  ~Extras/Rating~ The owner reached out to me after my last review. He thanked me for the review... the thing is, they deserve the accolades. I hope adding my extra two cents to the fray will bring a big more attention to the location. I haven't had a bad experience here, nor a bad wine. I still assert this place is the best place for authentic wines in the basin here....I mean, come on they bottle Kokopelli's wines now guys! Available at Total Wine and most of the grocery stores out here, they are the local wine pros. Do not mistake them for selling out, they hardly have done that. They are just making it easier for me to get the wines I like at a store nearby. 5 stars for great service, great food, outstanding wines, perfect atmosphere and a good owner who knows his clientele. Salut!

I loved, loved, loved the fair when I was a child. I LOVED IT. I got to see the Beach Boys in my first ever concert...such good times. I was so happy when we went. I would go at least 3-4 times while it was in town. Well, I definitely DO NOT love what the fair has become. Its a travesty, a sham, and...well...a mockery. Guys: its a Travishamockery. Let me explain why...now:  ~What To Do~ Well, you will blow boatloads of cash..that's numero uno. Besides that, you can check out all the rides they offer, as well as exhibitions ranging from animals to crafts and baking, as well as the Expo area, where retailers hawk their products. Oh and the food, its the one time of the year where most people wont judge you for eating your soul away.  ~The Good~ Eh... there are some "bright spots". The food is fun and different. I love the Indian Fry Bread stations, although every single vendor is not the same....you have to be picky. The food options are abundant as well, and if you do not care about what you put in you, its a field day for you. The Expo they hold each year has some fun vendors each year. In 2013, they weren't as much fun as previous years, but still they held my attention for a bit. I did try some of the extreme rides....holy hell, scary, but fun. I will admit I did enjoy hanging out with my fiance in cool weather, it was refreshing and relaxing to stroll around and have some fun. Also, the concerts and events they offer each year are pretty good for free admission, I simply haven't had the time or I would've hit up a number of them over the years.  ~The Bad~ Oy Vey...So, lets say about 7+ years ago (approximately) the whole re-invention of fairs began nationwide. With that change came increased prices, lower quality prizes, insanely fatty and poor quality foods, and whats worse: a really crummy corporate feel, by way of RCS out here in Phoenix. So now, we are left with what RCS has provided us. Its really a shell of former fun times. We still have the awesome destruction derby and concerts, as well as some fun rides still.. But they have stripped  all that away with the watered down prizes and games that are pretty much rigged....And the prizes... I mean, come on. They deduce down to dog chew toys really. Perfect size for our Yorkie and Chihuahua. Rips in about 3 days time.   Prices are outrageous and I am consistently keeping an eye on spending...you are a fool to go to the fair and just spend whatever...because you will spend 100+ EASY with that mindset. I see a number of people defending the current incarnation, and it amuses me. I remember the balloon darts, when I could win a huge framed picture to hang up on my wall (I remember choosing a Michael Jordan picture)...Well, now, we have balloons, with hackisack-style balls filled with pellets. The balloon dart signs, with pictures of darts are still out there!!!!!   Ruining my childhood memories, that's what RCS is doing. And diets too, they just ruin so much...Up-charge me at the gate, and get rid of RCS. I do not care about spending more to get in, FOR A QUALITY PRODUCT. Getting in for free is not worth it. Just wretched. I could go on and on.. deplorable.   ~The Down low~ I really am not sure where to go from here. Really am not. It's a rubbish product, really. Its like paying for a Jaguar, and getting an Aveo... its not right. I am giving 2 stars, because it actually could get worse, and if it does, I have an option to downgrade. I mentioned the redeeming factors already, which all make up the 2 stars they receive...but they do not help. Not a bit. I'll spare writing further, and let the review speak for itself. Save the money and go up North and hike and get your palms read by a hippy....or go golfing... or go to Castles and Coasters and mess around with your family....or go to Scottsdale and steal someone's Audi....or do a meth lab bust in AJ. All of these are equally invigorating and less expensive options, than spending $10 to throw a ball in a basket, attempting to win a cheap stuffed 1000'' stuffed bear.

As it states on the rating, this is as good as it gets.  I was skeptical of Cirque shows in general. It just seemed too flashy for me. I am not into the bare-skinned maneuvering rope jumpers like I had seen from other Cirque show previews. Needless to say, I was expecting some amazing music with so-so dancing.   BOY, was I wrong. This show can be summed up in 3 categories- Visual, Musical, Atmospherically/Storyline  Visual- Visually stunning comes to mind. The way the set were produced was just unbelievable, and it just goes to show how the songs are all great stories. Each set was painstakingly put together to add to the story. My best example would be the main sequence involving the bombing of England and the subsequent revival comes to mind. Also, the acrobatics are breathtaking. It is as advertised, amazing and over the top.....But in the good way!  Musical- Come on, its the Beatles. If you are even a general fan, the way they re-scored the songs will please your eardrums. As a life-long Beatles fan, they did not take advantage of their original scores, and certainly very few if any liberties were taken. Also, just adding everything together makes the music that much more enjoyable  Atmospherically/Storyline- The atmosphere the story provided really was surprising. I didn't think they could pull it off, especially the way they were going with it. I like how the producers decided on multiple tie-ins and stories, in which you can go many directions as you follow along. The story is great and adds to the music you hear.  Honestly, I do not know how long the show will last. I mean, its been there for years. That is a testament to how good the show is, rather than dying off it rides on strong. See it before its gone. I hope I get a chance to get back and see it one more time. Its that good.

Hereth is thy 's (...thou's......thee's....oh hell, Old English be damned) review of Rose and Crown:  ~Ambiance~ Who doesn't enjoy a fun English pub? This pub is utilizing an old old house, so people who do not understand the layout may miss the point when entering it. Its supposed to be quaint and small, that's the small part of how great R&C is. I love the ambiance and the atmosphere is great. I have come at varying times throughout the day: From at night when they are having trivia to before/after ball games. Each time, we have been kindly greeted and quickly sat. The servers are all great, they treat you well and are very helpful.   ~Fud~ I will start with complaints, because they are not big deals. The food is great, although a bit pricey. You expect that, with it being downtown.   Considering the portion sizes, some dishes (primarily fish and chips) are over-priced. That's understandable, its fish, but you get so little of something SO GOOD! I do want to point out that most prices are fair and fit well with the sizes of the meals assigned to them. Also, some beers are a bit warm, someone else pointed that out in a previous review. Its not too warm, I have had much much warmer beer, and it seems to be a non-issue, I do not have it happen to me a lot. Once again just a few times, so its nothing to really note of, especially when they have an excellent selection of beers. That being said, they have a great selection by the way, many euro-style brews to choose from with varying textures as well as a typical full-bar. But the food is excellent, and should not be missed at all! Although pricey, it tastes great and is worth it. I can trust only about 4-5 places out here with preparing and making me fish and chips, which here is done perfect for an English pub. They take seafood seriously, as their chowder soup is amazing as well... Overall great food experience despite some minor issues to nag over. No place is perfect.  ~Extras~ They are a stone's throw away from BOB (or Chase Field, for you Arizona Transplants). It is an awesome spot to go to prior to the game, and a bit cheaper considering prices inside. Heritage Square in general is awesome along with the Science Center, so keep in mind you can hang around that area for a while if you'd like. It is not exactly the best place for children, minus during the day time and a quick trip for a bite before the Science Center. I would recommend sitting outdoors if its cool enough, rather than indoors with all the pub garb everywhere. Your children will find food options because they do offer amazing food options once again, but this place is geared 0% for children, haha.

There are many Med options out there, and like one person has noted, there are a handful on Mill that cater this type of food. Unfortunately for the others, this one is the best. Aligning the walls of this establishment are awards for their outstanding service and food. The owner is Turkish and has developed an amazing array of handmade dishes he undoubtedly learned to love in his native country.  I appreciate so many different things about this place. The gyros are great and the food feels fresh, not processed or stale. The salads are good, as is the humus. Being a smaller business, they make their dishes in house, and the processed foods are swept away, making this a quality and enjoyable meal. It might taste different to you, and that's because it is.   There are many fine Greek restaurants out in the valley that push out amazing dishes, this is not a "fine dining" establishment like others, filled with waiters and high priced side dishes. What Med-Fresh does is  push out amazing food at a good price, and the locals have steadily fell in love with it. I was worried with the economic downturn that this start up might not last, but ASU students and locals have embraced it.. Also, notice all the ethnic and minority groups that frequent this place. Its a very good sign of whether or not its a true-blue restaurant, or non-traditional. I always notice many foreign students sitting and enjoying the food, which assures me that considering where they are at for the time being, this is their best and favorite spot.  Try their Gyros first unless you are a big Med food geek, which in that case you can expand further of course. Start small, then go from there. Enjoy!!!

Of all the Restaurants and bars I have been to over the years here in Arizona, none has such consistently bad service as San Felipe's. Sadly, this location is a great one for a Mexican Restaurant, however they simply do not provide service. At no point do I think they even explain what service actually IS to new hires. Service, in this case, is a fable, a myth.....not real.   THE PAST 3 TIMES my fiance and I have come to eat/drink here, we sat down for around 10+ minutes as servers walked right by us. They were busy and packed as usual, but still, come on....10 minutes and no one even comes by? Within a couple minutes, you would think someone would at least tell us "hey, I'll be right with you, I am so sorry we are SWAMPED!" My fiance is a waitress, and she can't comprehend the consistent approach they take to NOT LOOKING FOR US. We quietly waited the last time with our hands in our laps expecting someone to come up. Our gaze into the distance just screamed "we are ready to be served", and no one came. It was the final, annoying, straw.  We are extremely patient, needless to say. I do not complain ever to a business about bad service because I rarely receive it. And I definitely never make a fuss, we are not going out to eat to get free handouts for bad service. We have tried to give them our business, but not anymore. How could we? They place no emphasis on us and how we feel. The wait staff  prefer instead to flirt with the guys they are serving to get bigger tips, it happens constantly, and its blatant. Even worse, they park themselves and sit down to talk to their current table, while we sit here waiting to be helped. I do not plan on EVER coming here again.  I do not say that often. I gave this place so many chances to get better, and it got worse. This one let me down big time. I don't rate a place as badly as this unless they deserve it. But honestly, the food is not worth waiting in the first place. Its not traditional and the dishes are fatty Tex-Mex without much thought put into it. I can think of at least 15 other cantinas whom would provide better service, better happy hour specials, and much better food.   I hope management changes their service focus. It seems there is none at this point, so nowhere to go but up, LOL.   If they do and I see fellow Yelpers giving the OK, I might try back. I'll patiently wait and see...

OK. If you look at my profile, you will see that I bowl. Boom. Yes. I bowl a lot in fact. I have a very high average, and am really good. I only will bowl at certain locations, because I am a picky, high average bowler. I have actually bowled at every lane in Arizona, and I can tell you each one is different. Recently, I have bowled almost two full season leagues at Kyrene Lanes, and can't say anything better about the way they handle the lanes. I do look at this more practically from a "bowling alley standpoint" than I do entertainment value. So, disregard my comments if you're interested in pizzaz. I am all about the comfort and the lane conditions, and professionalism of the staff.   Well, lets just say they JUST RENOVATED! HOORAY! Its been a few months, but its now up to par with all the other Brunswick's in the valley. I will not bowl at AMF lanes, as they truly dumb down bowling and do not provide as quality of a product as Brunswick. Trust me, Brunswick is the way to go. Here at Kyrene each lane has its own widescreen TV, this location has its own special bar, and they've got a large backing of veteran staff whom can assist you in numerous capacities. I travel from Central Phoenix to this location because its that great. If you can't practically drive that far, do choose another Brunswick, once again.  Finally, as for prices, they are market rate at each location you go to, nothing different. The fact that they haven't changed rates since the remodel is a testament to their service. If you want excellent single game rates and food/part coupons, go onto Brunswickbowling.com, join their e-mail list and enjoy amazing coupons....its one of the only e-mail coupon lists I would recommend joining. Do it, its once again worth it.  ENJOY! E-mail for more Q's!

Chipotle is an interesting animal. They have many unique qualities and their service is always streamlined.  This review is for this and all locations I have been to prior. Chipotle......GO!  ~Fud/Drink~ The food is tasty...enough said. Delving deeper, you can see a bevvy of food options you can sink your teeth into. The meats are delicious to say the least. My personal fav, the barbacoa, really ties the burrito together (Big Lebowski reference). The other meats taste great, but barbacoa is seasoned perfectly. As for the ingredients, everything always tastes fresh, from the salsas to the beans and rice.... everything. You can stack as much of an ingredient into your burrito as you see fit, and I take advantage of this by piling on the the grilled peppers and onions. Is it the finest Mexican cuisine? No... But for someone looking to dine out and not eat a ton of calories like myself, Chipotle does it right. They provide you a menu off to the side that shows all the calories in each ingredient, and its easy to keep the calories off by following what you are putting in. I usually keep out the tortilla, which saves a lot of grief and calories, and still allows me to fill up on fresh Mexi-food. This is completely different to most Mexican restaurants. Nothing is deep fried, but rather fresh and filling. As for a bar or drink, there is nothing beyond a couple generic Mexican beers or a soda fountain.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ I never have much liked the overall restaurant concept, which oozes eat quick and leave. There are no TV's for you to lounge around and watch, music is not piped through the system, and the  chairs are wooden and not overall comfortable. Really, it makes sense, many people do not eat in, they get the burrito to go. It still might help to add a little more atmosphere to the overall experience, if you ask me. The service is always lightning quick. Despite long lines, they still get you in and out quick, and are quick to add the ingredients. Overall, they also are quite kind and talkative, I have never had rude service from service crews. Its a nice way to get Mexican, just no real atmosphere to experience the food in.  ~Extras/Rating~ Not much else to note, besides the various options you can get when choosing how to dine. There are so many combos you can go with, its fun to change up your burrito experience by coming here. As for the rating, they lose a full star for having no atmosphere whatsoever. I know its their concept, but still, not even a TV? It would be something if they put out some new options, like board games or other items to entice customers to stay more...Open up more bar options, then revenue increases.....gah, who am I to complain about business models? 4 Stars for outstanding food and great quick service!

Super L is great, I really love a ton of their amenities. Unfortunately, it is an Asian Food City. That's OK though, I can dig an Asian Food City. Let me explain this spot.  ~The Good~ The vegetable selection is out of this world. So many varieties, its hard to list them all. They offer Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) at the lowest prices in the valley. LOVE IT! So many different cabbages, and so on...I could go on and on. The meat selection looks good as well, especially the seafood, which has a ton of different fishes. The sake and Asian wine selections is also really cool, right above the frozen food beds filled with yummy frozen seafood.  The noodle and rice section, as expected, is overwhelming and filled with great choices. The sauces section is also huge, you forget sometimes how many sauces are featured in Asian cooking. Finally, I do not eat any baked goods normally, but the bakery looks really good. If I did eat treats on a normal basis, I'd come here.  ~The Bad~ With the good comes the bad, especially the unsightly open tanks filled with the fish and seafood. It smells "interesting" in the meat/seafood section, hence the reason I usually do not get anything there. The fish are almost always sold whole....I prefer pre-cut, personally. I also do have a hard time with the sheer enormity of all the goods, most of them without much descriptions. I really have to do my homework either WHILE shopping or BEFORE shopping, or I will be buying something I have no clue about. It is an adventure, shopping here, nonetheless.  ~The Down Low~ This place really is a 3.5 out of 5. 2 stars go out for the sheer amount of specialty Asian foods to select from, and another for the sake/beer selection....more than anywhere else in the valley. A 1/2 star goes out to the seafood selection, omitting some stars for the previously discussed issues I have with the meat/seafood section. Come here for anything food-wise you could want from Asia...just expect a wild trip going through the aisles, and remember to come prepared!

The Farmers Market is so helpful....in many many ways. Since starting my new, cleaner diet, a weekend is not complete without a stop-over at this market. This is the most complete market in Metro Phoenix, hands down! Definitely a fan. Let's shop around the Old Town Farmers Market:  ~What To Do~ Located right off the main strip in Old Town Scottsdale, the Farmers Market takes up residence almost every Saturday in a parking lot, housing everything from on-site cooked or home-made pastries to small-batch concoctions, as well as housing numerous local/state-wide farms whom truck in their own produce for that day. From time to time knick knack stands are available, however the bulk of things to purchase are going to be.....edible!   ~The Good~ The location is perfectly nestled away from all the traffic of Scottsdale road, and is right across from a major parking garage and other parking areas as well. During hot months (which there are a lot of) they have screens already put up which will shade you from the Sun.  There is enough variety to go around when it comes to farm representation; four separate farms usually are at each event on Saturdays. The on-site cooks can make a bevy of different items; from swanky bar fare (Brat Haus) to a French cuisine specialist...they even have a mobile coffee supplier (What's Your Grind) whom prepares Iced and Hot coffees, on top of selling their general product. My personal favorite vendor is Heaven and Earth Macrobiotics. They create the most palate-pleasing vegetarian friendly food I have ever tasted... THEY ARE A MUST TRY. As you can see, overall selection is superb. Best Market in town.  ~The Bad~ Nothing negative to comment on....Just some grievances I have about this market that really stem from small nitpicking issues...Many vendors hawk items I simply take no interest in. I am not much of a Salsa guy, but it seems each week there are 3 separate salsa people. I know they have a variety and to keep the events as large as possible, but having 6+ separate bakeries come out each week offering breads seems like over-kill. Perhaps it's me...just nitpicking.   ~The Downlow~ Overall... this is the best market in town...Thus, they get the most stars. If you are the best, you get the most stars...seems simple enough! As for the stars, they get 5 for location, variety of vendors, abundance of farms, selection of on-site prepared foods, and Strong balance of comfort/health food vendors. This is a great choice to take the kids to prior to your big day out, or even a simple fun way to get out with your significant other. I have been coming each week, and do not see myself stopping!

There are positives and negatives to many bars nationwide. Same thing here at Rhumbar. Lets rum it up and discuss this tropical joint..  ~The Good~ They really pour on the rum, in the sense that they do not shy away from relying heavily on rum-based drinks. As rum-lover myself, this seems to be the single most difficult liquor to request at bars. The bulk of barkeeps simply go to the 3 main staples of Rum which are: Rum and Coke, rum and OJ/Pineapple and any of the wide variety of sugary fruity drinks women love. Issue is, those drinks get boring after ordering them continuously. Enter the Rhumbar, which has a very solid variety of rums of all different colors for someone like myself to enjoy. The drinks on their menu are mixed perfectly, not too sweet, and strong enough to feel that yummy rum kick. I personally though the Zombie was on par with many others I have had, and the other drinks were well made as well. I also recently came back to enjoy a white mojito, which was unique and tasty. Finally, the barkeep delivered me my personal staple of Pyrat rum, splash of OJ and a orange slice, exactly as asked. Love the outside and the ability to hookah, even though I do not hookah personally it is a nice touch.  ~The Bad~ I first off, really do not like the door-guy they have here. He is bald, older in his mid 40's, and is a real prick. I mean, no way to go about it. He is a prick. And the $10 to get in at 10pm is also a joke, when no one is there especially. I get that they can have a cover charge for the place, but its a bit steep when nothing is going on. If perhaps he could actually see how many people are physically on the property, that would be nice and all....But no...plus he is a prick, so yea. Anyway, he sucks, and the cover does too. So get in before 10pm guys if you want to not pay that. cover for the patio entrance. I also noticed no restrooms which is no bueno, especially if you are buzzed and enjoying the DJ.   ~The Downlow~ Overall, this place could be a 5 star spot if they did not have such a prick running the door. He really does ruin it, and I have been here about 3 times on 3 separate trips, just specifically to run into Mr. Baldhead "El Prickerino" DoorGuy, who instantly is a buzz kill. 4 stars go to great rum selection, good specials drink menu I can actually enjoy, fun space, and great bar keeps. One star lost for Cue Ball. Come party at this spot before clubbing it at One Oak, or another place nearby. I prefer it because of its emphasis on rums, but they do have a fun list of drinks. Enjoy and look out for my bald headed friend. Give him a high-five, or a wig...one or the other.

You know how the guy on ESPN uses the catchphrase "Useful....useful shot"?  Well, this review is Useful....if you want a shot. Go here, it suits you well.  ~Fud/Drink~ I smiled when I saw Restaurant in the title for this place. The food is consistently sub-par, even the apps are lackluster. I got sick here prior to a Coyotes game, thank you McFaddens for making me howl PRIOR to the game itself. I thus, never have eaten here again, because why bother when you get sick from an appetizer. Not too appetizing. You go here to get wasted, but where is the fun in that? Speaking of drinking, the drinks are average as well. Its your average bar option, nothing with pizazz. I could recommend it if there was something of note, like Saddle Ranch's Beer Tower, but they aren't even that creative here. The beer's are expensive as well. Why am I paying so much for these suds and wretched food? It's just a lose-lose situation. Also, its a poor choice if you want something Irish, because its a saloon, right? Haha.... If you come here, later, during the game, you will be asking yourself  "Why did I come here.....?"  ~Atmosphere/Service Just when the food is bad here come the waitstaff, who are not quite bright in the head. You go in, you sit down, and they do not attend to you quickly. You would think after repeated attempts to waive your hand in the air (I rarely do this, its a necessary evil), that they would see you. They don't. They must have some kind of Ray Charles syndrome. Or Stevie Wonderitis. Can you name another blind person style syndrome? Message me with one and I can add it, because that would be what the waitstaff must have... Actually, the blind are upstanding citizens with amazing senses, they would probably do a better job, hence I feel bad bringing them up. Oh well, anyway....   ~Extras/Rating~ You might be surprised they get even two stars...and heck, they really do not deserve them. I give them one star for the location and another for still, after all the bad experiences, not being the worst bar I've attended to this point. Congrats to that! They are more worthy of 1 1/2 stars, but why not, I have pity on this spot...so two it is. Just stick with me on this one, and stay away guys! Leave this place for the drunks. There are so many better options in this center. I mean, seriously.

Yogurtland........ Is........The......Best.... Hands down. Look up "Fro-yo" in a dictionary and a storefront of Yogurtland is the main picture.  There are so many imitators out there, and some taste pretty good...Many however, do not.... blech. Yogurtland however, is as consistent in quality as any food service place I can possibly remember. The flavors are fresh, they keep everything up to date and change with the season their flavors.   My personal fave will always be Pistachio, it is just that good. With the widest variety of non-fat and low-sugar yogurts, it truly is a healthy option to go for. It actually gives you no reason to get ice cream, when a MUCH MUCH healthier option is sitting and staring at your gut.  Everything is tasty as can be and the location is also kept clean, which is why I chose to write on this one specifically. LONG LIVE YOGURTLAND!

In Phoenix we all are subject to a number of poor food choices that claim they're "authentic", and its anything but. However all is not lost: Behold the great Pho Thanh, the best Vietnamese food in the valley. Lets slurp up a bowl of pho-knowledge in this review on this restaurant!  ~Fud/Drink~ This small, unassuming restaurant off of Camelback has amazing flavors popping out of the kitchen. The Pho is fresh, not made from different canned ingredients. The dishes are out of this world and very much authentic. For a good starter, the spring rolls they make are huge and sumptuous. With mint, shrimp, and pork, my personal favorite is Goi Cuon. As for entrees, by far the best out of my first three visits is #31 on the menu, Mi Xao Don . The freshly cooked veggies along with cooked pork and fresh broth-boiled seafood mix amazingly together atop a bed of crispy egg noodles. If you can stand waiting a few minutes, I suggest crushing the noodles, add a bit of soy sauce/ other sauces, and let the noodles soak it all in. All the dishes are succulent, savory, and the prices for the quantity of food is out of this world. I have left each time with leftovers, the portions are that big. They have over 100 separate dishes, the list is extensive, to say the least. They do not serve alcohol here, however the list of soft drinks and traditional Vietnamese offerings like baby coconut milk or thai tea is......extensive once again.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ This is the reason they lose a star. I am not a big atmosphere person, unless it simply detracts from the experience all-together. There are three separate issues to point out. First, the music and decor in the restaurant....they  are "interesting". They have it seemingly on a looped CD with Vietnamese covers of popular American music. I cannot tell a lie, at one point "She Bangs" came on... I hadn't heard that in over 5 years, folks. The decor is once again "interesting" and detracts from the experience. Instead of adding to the atmosphere and putting up traditional pictures or decor, they have two separate posters of a woman threading a blanket. TWO posters....as if one is not enough. Second, is the bathroom. You can smell it as you walk towards it. They seem to not have a scheduled time to clean up the bathroom each day, its pretty bad. Third, the service is extremely prompt, let me make this abundantly clear.  Faster than I have seen at most food establishments for that matter. But if you were to ask them for recommendations, it may prove to be difficult, as they are in a hurry to service other tables. We do not get many smiles or get asked how we are doing....To be honest, I am sure its a cultural thing. I shrug it off, if you take things like that to heart then you need to check yourself. Overall, these aren't hideous issues, but a star lost is more than fair, in my mind.  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, the food is outstanding. They get 4 stars for variety of choices, quality/taste of food, price point in comparison to quanitity, and lightning fast service. But honestly, "She Bangs"?  If not for those issues, its a 5 star top choice for me. Regardless, this has become my favorite go-to spot locally. I have gone 3 times the past two weeks, and at some point this week and next I shall go again....and I can't wait. Bring on the Pho Thanh, I say!!!  Enjoy!

YAYYY! I recently returned to MBFGE after a 1+  year hiatus. I was in dire need of some food in my belly. Here is my review for the Tempe location (not sure if there are others...)  ~Fud/Drink~ The Greek food is exceptional considering its in a fast-to-plate setting. Right off the bat, flavors mix well and do not taste amateurish. They have enough unique items on the menu to give the gyro-happy crowd something to cheer about, as well as the adventurous ones who wants to try the Greek Fries, etc. The daily specials actually seem to be special, with lobster on the menu as well as other fish items, it just keeps the variety going. They have a lot of drink specials throughout the week, although I haven't taken advantage of them. I prefer to slip in for a quick pita then go off on my merry way.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Good vibes come from this pita place. They get their orders out fast to you so you can enjoy, its no thrills or frills. The bathroom is dank and nasty, its pretty obvious they skimp on other things and focus directly in on the food. I want to make it clear that I do not stay, so its really not important that some things are skimped on, as long as the food is bomb...which it is :-D If I were to stay, I would definitely do so in the bar, and I would suggest the same to you. More of an environment inside if you ask me. In all, its nothing like the usual My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. Service is fast and friendly, they are courteous and mindful of your time. Once again, no thrills, just good food and service.  ~Extras/Rating~ The plates are huge here, you really do not need to push the extras with a lot of the plates...you get a ton of food. They do have a lot of extras, though. Do not consider this place a dive, it looks kinda dive-ish inside when you walk in, but just toss that misnomer aside. Great place to grub out at with some friends. I give it a 4 out of 5 star rating for its low prices, quality of food to price(s) paid, specials/happy hour menu, and fast service by people with smiles on their faces.

Sandbar, you provided me amazingly lame service tonight.. Royally lame. You will not get my business again based off of the experience I had in your establishment. Wait, I didn't even enter the establishment....so I will not attempt to give you my business again... and I invite you to message me and/or call me regarding my experience, which I doubt you will do.. My night at Sandbar lasted 1 glorious minute. It was epic, and not in a good way.  So...... I walk up in my LA Galaxy Herbalife soccer jersey (I distribute Herbalife's product, so it makes sense to wear gear affiliated with the brand), and the college-aged bouncers look at each other and say "No go bro. You can't wear athletic gear in." I was stunned. I mean, I was dragged to this place at 11pm at night and would normally not wear a jersey out. But I was asked to go at the last minute and could not change my wardrobe...It is what it is.   BUT TO NOT LET SOMEONE IN BECAUSE THEY ARE WEARING A JERSEY!?!?!?! WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT........IS.....THIS........Seriously... Are they afraid my Herbalife gang will get upset with the New York Red Bulls posse and we will get in a tussle? . What I do know, is that I was not allowed entry into a bar, which has never happened to me. I am no hood. I am a 26 year old white guy in shorts and a soccer jersey. They must have a reason why, but it can't be because of proper dress attire. The bouncers had no answer for me.  The bouncers had the gall, by the way, to ask the girls: "Does he have anything under the shirt, maybe?" Seriously? You just denied me service, I am walking away.. Why would I want to eat/drink here?They did lose out on probably $75+ in business ($25 / person), and I definitely do not plan on coming back after the customer service was beyond poor. I can't think of a worse experience, given the lack of interest or concern for the customer.   Fact is, I was interested after viewing all the reviews from Yelpers. I wanted to go and have fun, and because of my non-gang affiliated sports attire which wasn't revealing or obscene, they denied entry. I plan on enjoying my time at numerous other bars that have general sense of mind.

Other than the fact that you can dive into the joint from the sidewalk, I am not sure how you can consider this Tiki Bar a dive. Lets put our grass-skirt on and do a review on Hulas:  ~Fud/Drink~ Off the top, I have to say that Hulas is EXACTLY how I imagined it went I was day-dreaming about cocktails in the middle of my 4x10 shift. The cocktails they offer are simply bliss. Have a couple of them and your rum-soaked mind will transport you to a beach filled with......er....more booze? Wherever Jimmy Buffet goes to after he get schnockered, just imagine that...Wherever it be, we are talking about a tropical paradise.    I tried a Zombie, which is a concoction of numerous tropical fruit juices along with rum...You just have to try it, its the house specialty. I was the DD, so I could only try this one drink before sobering up... next time, I will break necks to be able to have a couple. I did indulge in the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...which were equally amazing. I can't describe in words how filling this appetizer was. Needless to say, I was in heaven chowing down on the fish cakes, along with my Zombie...a sentence never spoken until now, btw.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ I went on Halloween night this year. I was expecting ghouls and spookiness. I got a tiki band with a bass playing upbeat beach songs, all dressed as zombies. It was 100 times more fun than spooky music, and set the scene. All waiters were dressed in fun costumes, and proved to be helpful when I asked questions. When we sat down, a waiter came up and helped us order while I waited for a friend to show. I do have to say that he was a tad bit awkward, kinda hovered a tad every now and then, but I'll give him a pass...at least he cared and kept coming back, rather than never again. While relaxing and eating/drinking, I checked out the space, I love how wide open they made the venue, with easy entry to the outside. As to where you can sit, you have a large wrap around bar top to sit at, as well as outside seating, perfect for cooler temps. As you can tell, the place is all set up as a tiki feel, you almost would come to expect a sand-volleyball court would be set up nearby. Fun times, nonetheless.  ~Extras/Rating~ I have nothing but good things to say about this location. They offer a ton of fish items, so next time I am over, I think I will splurge and give some things a try. Add them on Facebook ASAP, because they offer numerous deals each week. Check out their website which also has info on their daily specials. Combining the specials with normal prices, you can really have an awesome time at a lower price, which is why I really love this place. I can't wait to go back, it only took one night, one dish, and one drink to hook me on...so I am sure they'll get you hooked too! Stop on in! 5 stars goes to Hulas for location/atmosphere, cocktail varieties, food selection, daily specials, and strong management/customer service. You can tell they are doing it right. Thank you Hulas!

My liver cowers in fear of Total Wines...Lets be objective: You have a bevvy of choices to appease the liquor-lover inside you. But how many of them carry literally every possible beverage option you can imagine? Total Wines does. Its scary when someone says such a thing..."I love looking at liquor, bro!"...But here, it is ok....and I will explain why now!  ~What to Do~ Find and procure whatever alcohol option your taste buds prefer. Also, attend classes/seminars on the art of the drink, as well as the occasional tasting, depending on the offering.  ~The Good~ Looking in each aisle, you get a really good sense of options for how to get your drink on. The selection, no matter the type of drink, is beyond comprehensive. They have items from around the world, some of which I never would have known or been able to try...especially in the beer aisles and the numerous liquors they ship in from other countries. The prices are so reasonable that I can try out new items without breaking the bank. At a supermarket, your choices are limited at best to the popular brands, at a general markup. And yes we do have Bevmo here in the valley. Bevmo pales in comparison, their prices simply do not match up to Total Wines on a consistent basis. The events they hold are very strong as well, something Bevmo doesn't do. Their selection doesn't either. I understand my drinks, so all I really need are general suggestions or navigation help, and they provide that with customer service. I asked about the different coconut rums offered here (they have 8 different brands, off the top of my head) and the nuances of each. The rep was able to explain the differences, like alcohol %'s, taste, creaminess, etc. Outstanding service. Finally, they provide a comprehensive free book on all their offerings, along with price points and general information. It is a great tool, they also have another book free of charge which delves into the different types of drink from around the world. Thank you, Total Wine.  ~The Bad There really is not much to complain about. The prices are almost always lower than anywhere else (I check), and customer service is very strong. I do take issue with the beer growler station they have, which does not allow you to taste test the offerings. I am no smarty pants, but I feel like this is something that would markedly enhance my experience and allow me to choose more openly what they are offering. Why would I buy an entire growler filled with a craft beer I may not like? I know, right? So that makes me shake my head a bit. Other than that, we are sound as a pound.  ~The Down Low~ If Frank the Tank were real, he would shop here. He would marvel at the prices, throw his keg into the back of the not street legal Red Dragon, drive home laughing, then hold an awesome party. Originally I have TW with 4.5 stars due to the growler station snafu, but I will round up with Yelp's star system. 5 stars go out to Total Wine for the outstanding selection, amazing prices, strong customer service, fun/insightful events, and fast friendly checkout. When you want something from a vine, you best go to Total Wine. :-D ENJOY!

With so many doctors in the valley, it is difficult to really gauge who "is the best". Actually, its pretty much impossible. There is no "best", there are simply really good doctors who know what they are doing. Dr. Hilts, is one of those Dr.'s   ~The Good~ There are a number of highlights with her practice, mainly her superior expertise in the field of Diabetes. I am not a diabetic, but a large portion of her patients are, and they keep coming back to her in droves for her assistance. She in fact IS a diabetic, which I am sure lends to reason why she has such a high understanding of the disease itself. She is a primary care doctor with a heavy emphasis on this disease, so I think she is a wonderful solution to those at-risk of becoming diabetic as well as diagnosed diabetics. Besides her knowledge in that field, she is quick to act whenever I need help. She has been practicing for over 20 years, has a large list of certifications, awards (including Top Doc in 2010), and simply has knowledge that others do not.   ~The Bad~ There really is very little, hence her rating. The front desk staff are courteous, however can be a tad direct at times and do a couple simple things off a bit...Example given that they continue to misspell my first name....its Jeffrey, guys....Jeffrey.  Also, they do assist well with pushing me into her schedule, but wait times, even when I get there early for a regular check-up, can be a tad long. I am a very patient person and know better than to schedule any doctor visits when I am pressed for time...others may not be so patient. Also, after I had asked a couple times to change the address of my prescriptions from one side of town to the other, they still keep sending it to the wrong facility. I am not sure how this is happening, as they assured it got changed. I simply call the facility and transfer it, but still, its the fact that it keeps happening. Overall, its the service of the doctor that counts the most, and I receive 5 star service from her each time I see Dr. Hilts.   ~The Down low~ Overall, its a great practice, its one-doctor show, so you know who you are seeing each and every time you come in. Dr. Hilts is an MD with an upbeat personality, and is truly here to help. Her service and guidance receives 5 stars, however due to admin issues, I am going to have to knock a star off with all the aforementioned issues. So 4 stars it is, she is definitely my favorite Doc! Come see this Dr. if you have sugar-regulation issues, need help with Diabetes, or are seeking a primary Dr. who is a specialist in hiding.

"She will be losing out on money because of your no-show." This is what I was told in response to a recent no show, for a doctor who can't be seen until the beginning of August. Its June 24th. Well doc, I am posting this on Facebook for all my friends I've recommended you to to see.  After having some amazing experiences, and shrugging off a few issues that weren't glaring, I am now fed up with this practice. I hate to say this because I have been seeing the Dr. for nearly 2 years...But I am fed up. The front staff has treated me fairly well, but the wait times have been a drag for me personally. I have shrugged it off because the doc is great. Too bad, because her policies are horse crap.  I was originally scheduled in for an 8am appointment last week. At the time, I remembered. Time changes that. Luckily I had a reminder card that said 8 on Friday. Normally her practice is open at random times throughout the week as late as 8 so I was prepared to come in at 8pm, because I have done this prior. Upon me coming over, they were closed, the sign said 5pm. My card said 8, on 6/19.  Now, regardless of my own stupidity for not recognizing times, the fact remains when I called to complain and ask to be rescheduled, I was met with the same poor customer service that I can see others have received. I have never been late once, but all of a sudden, one time I am late and I now have a $67 late fee?! My copay is $20, so that's 3 additional visits tacked on. Upon me reminding the staff I have been a customer for 2 years, and never been late, and just would like to reschedule minus this fee....they said no. It's doctors orders, she doesn't budge.  I have worked in customer service for over 5 years now, and unless you are a repeat offender, its common courtesy to accommodate the customer when they are genuine. Regardless of fault, the sheer lack of foresight in knowing how I'd feel about their decision to make me pay this fee is mind-boggling.   Oh and about 6 months ago the doc changed her practice suddenly on all her clients, including me. Asking me to pay an exorbitant cost to be in some random elite network. That didn't work for her at all, and she re-opened her practice again. I was pretty pissed about the entire affair, but she helped fill my meds and diagnosed me with an illness that was previously undetected. I went with the flow...because I am an easy going guy. After all of this, I am not so easygoing with her practice.   Anyway...this is all fine and dandy. This Friday, before work, I will be stopping by the office to pay my $67, and then let the staff know I will never be going to the doctor again.  Anyway, I have had it. I need new prescriptions to be filled, but will gladly fill them with a more traditional office that will not haggle me if I happen to be late, call them to apologize and advise on the mix-up. I can't recommend this place less, at this point. Shame, because I was their highest rated Yelp reviewer, and recommended her a number of times.   Good luck with that.

Ah, RigaTony's. This was the first restaurant my fiance and I went to together. I hold this place fondly in my heart for many reasons, but it doesn't get a 4 star rating simply for nostalgia...   ~Fud/Drink~ They have all the traditional Italian-American food staples, however their menu boasts flavors that Olive Garden and other cookie-cutter Italian stores wish they had. The seafood dishes, which I have had before, actually taste fresh. The Linguini in Clam Sauce was the last dish I chose, very rich and fresh once again. The clams matched pasta well and did not overtake the dish. The balance of all the sauces seems to serve each dish well. Many a time I have had Italian that was overpowered by sauces that took away from the dish, rather than complemented it...not here. Rigatony's has a full bar menu you can order your favorite drink from, as well as numerous wine options which pair well with foods on their menu. Is this dining elegance here? No. But the foods on the menu are rock solid, taste great and are comparable in price to the portion you get.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ The waitstaff are all courteous and knowledgeable of the items on the menu. I normally ask them to help me in my decision, and its imperative they have a general idea of what the menu has available for us. I have been twice, and both times the staff were quick to help us order and get our food in. The last time I went however, they did take a good amount of time to get the bill to us. That did not sour the night out, however it was a good 15+ minutes from the time I asked to the time it got to the table. That's just a bit too long after I personally request for the bill and you only have about two other tables to wait on.....Oh well, that's been the only hiccup here, so I can write that off :) The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. Its not overly romantic, it has more of a homey feeling inside with a nice Italian music backdrop. It is a family owned restaurant by the way, so you do not have a chain-restaurant feel to it like you do when you go into a Olive Garden..if that makes sense...  ~Extras/Rating~ Try their desserts. I have seen them and they look gorgeous. We have been too stuffed to ever try them, but I am sure one of the desserts will take the night to the next level if you do. Overall, this place is solid. They do a great job with treating the customer right and provide quality food with the right portions. Just like you'd expect from a family-owned restaurant. Please come any time of the day, however many people seem to enjoy their happy hour/Early Bird specials. Hope you enjoy it here, they treat you very well and you will go home happy! 4 stars for having quality, fresh dishes at proper rates, and providing solid service. They are among the cream of the crop of family-style Italian Restaurants.

OK. Prior to stepping foot inside I remember passing by this metal shed each time I would go to a D-Backs game. I always felt like I would either get raped or shivved if I strolled in here. I told this to the bartender, who laughed and said "Well that is a possibility". So, being a pasty white boy, how could I possibly have fallen in love with The Duce when death is so certain? Well, its because this place is like a loving pit bull: Looks are deceiving!  ~What to Do?~ You can drink....because it's a bar. You can enjoy a variety of eats and treats, if they have them. You can sing karaoke, if drunk enough...and you can entertain your large group of friends, if you have enough of them. Besides the wide open space in the main area near the bar, they also have Corn Hole and Ping Pong (or as they say in China: Ping Pang) tables ready to go!  ~The Good~ Service is great. The bartender was relaxed and quickly made me a drink after I looked at him bemused by the mason jars and high-end liquors. All the liquor is high-end (blow me, Baccardi) and just adds to the utter ironic nature of this place. A big shed, slinging high quality cocktails in mason jars? Like Marv Albert would say: "Yessssssss!!!!" They also offer old-school beers which like dinosaurs I thought were buried long long ago... So long that most of us never would think would be offered at this point. So wrong! You can find them here! It's just different at the Duce. The drink menu is huge, and the drinks are as well. Prices are a bit steep, but these are top shelf liquors we are drinking and the sizes are huge. Do the division, the price is right! Food looks serviceable, it's a give and take menu filled with fun items that will fill most gullets. I am on a diiiet, as in, I die inside when I look at the items on the menu. Looks yummy, I must say. Dessert is off the chain, from regular pies and shakes to spiked floats and shakes as well!!   Plus, the atmosphere is so chill....so chill. Ping pong and Corn hole in the middle room is an awesome touch, as is the random boxing ring, which I imagine numerous drunks crawl on. Karaoke on Thursday (when we went) was totally fun, even when only 15 people were in the joint. The staff all know how and when to buddy up and talk to their patrons, and make the place even more inviting.  ~The Bad~ So the desserts were pretty much all out. I was going to get Laura I. a surprise pie in a cup, and they were all out...lame. That's about the extent of the issues I had with the food itself. As for the venue, it's a tad dingy outside and inside (I mean, come on). I still am not sure about hitting this place up all by myself on a raging Saturday night.. Really though, this place has few flaws and sets itself apart because it rolls to its own beat.  ~The Low Down~ There is so much space here! You can take huge groups and bring them for a good time. Whether its karaoke or just because, if you live in Downtown/Central Phoenix, The Duce is an awesome and ironic spot to grab a drink (or 10). I am yearning to go back and fight my fear of being shot. I am curious. Maybe that's why my friends call me whiskers. Because I am curious like a...  4 stars for well-made eclectic drinks, a solid and mouth-tempting Menu, A+ atmosphere, and another star because it said so! Can't wait to go back!!

Talking Stick is the nicest resort-casino in Maricopa County...hands down. If I were coming from out of town, this is where I would want to go for a high-end resort-casino experience.    Being that I am from here, that changes  things of course haha. The food options are a bit nicer of course, its Scottsdale. Unlike most casinos, they choose to go with finer food options, opting for one burger stand, but even then the food choices are not too bad. The casino has a typical layout, nothing to really note. The showroom is huge, i have been in there before for an event and its done up very well. The pool in the back is great, the set up is perfect for the parties they throw in the summer. I went to an ASU Alumni event back earlier last year and it was so much fun. Beers were expensive, but it was still a lot of fun in the sun. Please do yourself a favor and come enjoy the outside pool this next summer, its a load of fun!  I haven't stayed yet, probably won't because I live here. I will try my best to get to more events and see what else is offered here. Besides basic gambling though, this is a jewel of a resort-casino compared to the others in the valley. ENJOY!

I am impressed that they have such variety but do not lack on quality one ounce. No, I wasn't expecting typical shoddy casino food when I chose to eat here. You are in Scottsdale, after all.   ~Fud/Drink~ I chose to eat some sushi....at a cafe..... I KNOW, RIGHT!?! I paired it along with a sake and beer. I did not bomb the sake haha, enjoyed them both separately. I was impressed with the quality once again. Both the sushi and sake were surprisingly good and tasty given where we were at. I was very impressed with the sushi and sake combo. The waitress knew the differences between the different listed sake's, how awesome is that?! Just on the sheer fact that sushi at a cafe was superb speaks volumes of this place. I picked at my sister's and fiance's plates, both their dishes were great as well. I forget what they got, but I did enjoy them, I at least remember that.   ~Extras/Rating~ This is the best dining option at Talking Stick in my eyes. They have a wide variety of options, it  seems as though the waitstaff care about you and have some answers, and I do not feel as though I wasted my money. It is a bit out of my normal price range, but next time I come to Talking Stick, I will definitely eat only here! They get 4 stars for service, quality and variety of food, and for being a surprisingly good option based off of initial face value.

I have lived here for going on  two years now, and my goodness, they have done a stellar job. Let me give you The Good, The Bad and the down low on Monterra.  ~What To Do~ Its an apartment complex.... :)  ~The Good~ First main positive is the physical location in relation to driving. You are twenty minutes away from each major city in Metro Phoenix. It is right off the 202, literally. This helps me on my daily commute to work, only 15 minutes away. My fiance, she is even closer at less than a 8 minute drive. The management here is great, they always are smiling! Smiling lease agents??? Yes! They are kind and helpful. When we had an AC issue last summer, they allowed us to sleep in their promo room near the front. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The maintenance team is always fast with turnaround times and they never quip if we feel like there are still lingering issues. They are non-hesitant about coming back and double checking work done. The rent is also very cheap compared to others in town, its striking to me. Overall, a really solid complex who haven't done us wrong.  ~The Bad~ Not too much. The location we live in, although very nice for commuters like myself, is situated in a not-so-nice part of the valley. I am not afraid to go out at night, but I wouldn't necessarily blame someone if they were. I have never had issues with any neighbors, and I have yet to hear any gun shots. This is a pretty low socio-economic area though, which is why the price is so much lower. Also, they are far away from a nice grocery store. The closest is a Food City, which I prefer not to step my feet in. We have to drive a bit to get to the Frys out off of Camelback, which is 15 mins away but worth it. The local residents also seems to forget to pick up their dog(s) poo, which is nice when you step in it at night. They put out ample dog waste areas and baggies for free, so its just laziness on their end. Lazy neighbors, sigh... The pool also has a bit too much chlorine it it....OK at this point, I am just stretching to find something bad about the place.   ~The Down Low~ I am seriously impressed. They get a solid 4 stars. Its great that they rate out this high, but they deserve it. They lose a star for the neighborhood, and the distance from a local nice grocery store. But that's really it guys. It's safe, very affordable, and the staff/maintenance take amazing care of their tenants. Please call them if you are looking for something in the area, you will be taken care of!

I have gone here about 5 times for service. I hate taking my car in, it scares the **** out of me. At 132 K miles, my car is old and I hate hearing that she is old. I know, it sucks. But they do an OK job here. I'll explain some of the good and bad...  ~The Good~ They have a ton of Groupon specials all the time, usually involving semi-synthetic oil-change deals, which I like. I have purchased numerous times their deals, usually for $25. Normally this gets me an SS oil change, new air/oil filter, tire rotation and inspection. They tell me a couple things that could be used or fixed and warn me about what could happen and so on. They aren't too pushy, which is nice. They get the job done and get me on with my life. Efficient and cheap with the deals, I keep going primarily for that.  ~The Bad~ The price quotes for their services are higher than other joints. I am not paying $200 to get hoses put in and changed. They aren't pushy, but they sure do make sure to remind me and upsell me on anything they can. They did not check the fluid levels by their clarity or quality....no no...they checked by mileage. Seriously? I went to Avis lube and they checked my levels, and if they are good and clear, they top it off. No topping off here. I get it, you are performing a ton of extra services on top of a oil change for a lower rate...but have the decency to check my levels before telling me I MUST GET a transmission flush. I don't. I just got one a year ago. We are good to go.  ~The Downlow~ Offering a full set of maintenance options is nice. Offering numerous name-brand specials on tires, cool beans. Trying to upsell me continuously without checking your figures, no bueno!! I am not a dollar figure! I have an older car, will get my needed maintenance, and simply need to know what does and doesn't need to get done. I give them 2 stars for good theri continuous good deals on synthetic blend oil changes. Besides that, I hate coming here,  with them trying to push more things on me. I suggest going to another local place for oil changes (look in my reviews for them), and for regular maintenance, there are tons of better spots. When in a pinch, these guys can help....but I suggest going elsehwere.

Unbelievable. There are so many things going down at this spot, its pretty shocking I have never heard about it until now. This review is for the movie experience and a partial look-see at the lounge during this past Saturday.  ~What To Do~ There are 4 distinct options. 1-Drink, 2-Drink and Dance, 3-Drink and watch a movie, or 4-Drink and nod your head to the music in the lounge...   ~The Good~ We chose option 3, which was a perfect experience. My fiance and I chose to go see "The Room" for the first time with a couple friends, and I was worried that it would be a quiet theater. Nope. Spoons were flying everywhere, people heckling the screen, it was perfect. I felt right at home with the screaming and heckling, it made the movie such an outstanding experience. The beer was not too expensive, and they had a lot of beers on tap. I went with an Orange Blossom brew, and I am now in love with it. They also have wine, once again, so many options to go with. Also regarding customer service, the barkeep let me try a swig of a brew I was eying. He was awesome, and got an extra couple bucks tip, for I remember him being the one whom let me also go in to see the theater earlier in the week (I was curious). They are all about making the guest happy, customer service was quick and fast. The ambiance of the theater and the lounge is very different, it exudes a local independent joint. Beanbags to lay down on are inside the theater as are high tops to sit with friends at. Its a simple yet shockingly exciting environment to be in.   ~The Bad~ My only issue is that they really have a big problem with noise coming from the lounge ((during)) the movie. That would be a big no-no, if you ask me. At times the bass and sheer noise from the lounge would envelop the theater, which was annoying at times. I know you are a bar, and that's cool, but damn that music is loud. Turn it down a bit and save your eardrums.  ~The Down Low~ Overall, this place is a solid 5 stars, however the noise issue knocks it down to a 4.5. They are part bar, its OK, I get it. The drinks are reasonably priced, its movie selection is spot-on, and the customer service is strong. Its an awesome ambiance, the atmosphere really meshes well, regardless of the reason for being there. Craft brews and movies go well, this is for sure. They have a check-in special on Yelp as well, which I failed to notice prior to ordering up my beer. Total Me-fail. I highly recommend this spot to watch your next cult classic. I can't wait for "The Room" to come again, because God knows I will be there. Having to wait for it on the calendar is, as you guessed, "Tearing me apart, Lisa!"

With a degree and background in health and wellness, I have tried way too many health fads. Whether its for an assignment when I was in school, or for my own personal use, I have seen a lot up to now in the diet scene. Well, I can now tell you unequivocally that Nutrition 101 has by far the best health program available for anyone out there....period.  I originally came off the street, and throughout my time here, eventually lost almost 18 lbs through just being a consistent customer and eventually purchasing some of the products they use in-house. My fiance has done even better, she lost over 20 lbs on the same product.  What is it? They make the healthiest shakes around. Using soy-based meal shakes, they fill you up on the spot with a 20 oz shake. These are protein based shakes, but honestly, they have so much more added in. There are no fillers, ask to see one of their canisters and you will see the ingredients. No smoke or mirrors, its pretty simple, it fills you up and does it the right way. You will also get a cold or hot herbal tea, which is now my daily coffee....Yea thats right, I don't drink coffee anymore. The tea is packed with energy, haha!   With all this said, just go in!!!! It's 6 bucks, and you will be filled to the brim for hours, rather than sulking around with a burger in your belly. Try them, tell them I sent ya too, they love when I refer people... Try it, you will get hooked like me.

As a man there comes a time....a very...very...sobering time...when you realize you are hairier than bigfoot. It did not hit me at age 12, when I won a hairy chest contest in Fiji...against men 4 times my age. It did not hit me when I would get called "fuzzy wuzzy" by all my sister's friends. And nope, it did not hit me when I dated a woman who purchased a hair trimmer just for my chest. It died after the first attempt.  No, it finally hit me after I recently became single: all the women before simply put up with my hair. They dealt with it, I mean I was nice enough. But I looked at myself, 28 years of being  hairier than a dog covered in honey rolling  around at a wig factory. I actually had an "American Beauty" late-twenties crisis moment come over me after I realized I was about to begin dating again. My female roommate gave me the nod and said to knock off the back hair. Before the back, I purchased a trimmer and trimmed off my chest, which took 30 minutes. I knew the chest would be worse, so I nixed that for now. Then I did my arms, followed by my legs. The trimmer still works! Thank you Ross!  But, God knows I was scared sh**less when I called up European Wax Center and made an appointment for 7:30pm right after work. I made sure they had the time for me (guys I had a ton of hair). After confirming, I was even more scared sh**less. I shouldn't have been....I walk in, freaking out inside. I sat for about 1 minute, then my specialist Billie came and greeted me. She was infinitely sweet. She "doot doot doot'ed" and made fun conversation with this scared ass the entire time I was back up, whizzing around spreading hot wax on me. I had...once again... a ton of hair. She whisked away hair painlessly. I had maybe 5 of the 30 strips actually hurt a bit, and these were at my shoulders and neck. I am still impressed.  2 weeks later, my back is amazing. I haven't had breakouts, and so far one of my lucky dates has been able to see my back.... And said nata! SUCCESS! I have another appointment with Billie in 2 weeks, and am looking forward to getting these hairs conditioned properly. I am not ready mentally for my chest, although I think the time after next I will be. Overall Five impressive stars goes out to this place for efficiency, cleanliness, great customer service, and impressively pain free wax. I can't recommend this place enough for my men out there. Just get that crap waxed boys, the ladies will remind you later ;-)

I come here perhaps more often that I should. Tsoynamis are my downfall *queue up Price is Right fail horn*. But then again, its better than blubbering over to Dairy Queen and crying inside an M&M Blizzard of shame.  Inside this hopping hub inspired by the geniuses of Green is part bakery, part ice cream shop, and part coffe haus....sprinkled with brunch awesomeness in the morning and on weekends. This is my go-to spot for any sweet treat, because as my friends know I do not eat crap. I am now on primarily a low-calorie, low carb, primarily vegan/fish based diet. I watch what I eat and work out regularly.  How does Nami fit in? After a stressful day, instead of grabbing 5 beers and nachos, or a heaping 3 scoop fatty ice cream, I come here. I grab a 100% soy-based ice cream treat called a Tsoynami, which comes with dozens of variations made up by Nami. My personal favorite is The Doughboy, with vanilla soy soft serve and 100% organic chocolate chip cookie dough. Horrible for you? Meh, not great by any means. Better than Coldstone. Actually, you could probably have two Tsoynamis and be still way better off than anything Coldstone, Baskin Robbins, or Dairy Queen has to offer.   They also have a very high quality coffee bar which provides basic coffee fair, along with a dizzying arrangement of baked goods all vegan friendly. The vegan doughnuts blow my mind. I have yet to dance the doughnut dance at Nami, but I can do an eye test and say "I approve".  Overall, I can't give this place enough love. It's super trendy, the food on the weekends (look at their menu) are so to die for gang...its delicious. Green is a business genius for concocting the awesomeness that is Nami. They have this man happy, and a customer for life. Enjoy, 5 stars.... for everything they have here. Just go, if you haven't been yet. Just do it already!

San Tan did a pretty bad job with me. I will keep it short in this review, because it is pretty simple:  1- The original salesman Ronald Sund was supposed to meet was with clients....he never met me. 2- The guy who covered for him was either new or inexperienced, because it was pretty evident. 3- **The Kicker** The Honda CRV I had my eyes on was gone, already sold the previous night.  Instead of contacting me and letting me know that #3 happened Ronald expected me to show up and just be fine with everything. I immediately went to Strike 2, when that occurred. What kind of horrible customer service is that, to not advise a client the car they originally intended to view was now gone? It's the kind of service you come to expect from someone who thinks they can get you to purchase a different car, and if they tell you your first choice is gone, so are you.  BY THE WAY: He still has not even apologized for that. STILL. He keeps emailing me about my car options. FAIL!  Needless to say, they showed me a 2013 Ford Escape. Nice interior, had Eco Boost. Problem: American made horses*** car. Looked up the car and all the reviews suggest reliability is null and void. I entertained his pitch for the car based solely on the fact that it was my first test drive in 8 years and I wanted to figure out what I was looking at. After hearing the initial prices, I balked a couple times. He dropped the price $100 / month quite quickly. Too Quickly. I was not impressed with the car, and was worried at how badly this place wanted it gone.  I give them 1 star. Uno. Un. One star goes to the poor schlub who tried to pull a rabbit out of his ass and get me to purchase an American made POS, after I mentioned about 10 times how I did not want to again purchase......an American made POS. Shame on this place for not being upfront and honest and advising me the CRV was not here. It reflects on their character when you do not even have the foresight to consider how driving 20 miles in 95 degree heat in a non-air-conditioned car may make a customer feel, let alone the let-down you get when the car you wanted is gone. One star. Congrats Ronald. Great job.

OHSO is oh so awesome. Like The Dude's rug, OHSO really ties the entire Arcadia Corridor together. Hopefully Nihilists do not take over this joint...  ~Fud/Drink~ Everything here is tasty, from the craft brews they have on tap fresh to the meals they have available. I for one can't think of a more relaxing time in Arcadia than when I sit down here to eat and drink. The variety of beers and drink are superb and the mixed drinks are not over-priced. I have not chosen to try their in-house brews, but I have heard from a few people they are not other-worldly. That is fine, because the variety is there. Food items are tasty and never leave me wondering "well I wish I went to...". Happy hour food items are also outstanding and well-priced. Honestly, you get a great rate of return here for what you pay for, no matter the menu item. As you will see in a second, the atmosphere is perfect for the area.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ The theory of a great atmosphere and experience is perfected here by way of the best patio experience in Arcadia. Outside near the canal, you have a bevy of booths to sit at and enjoy your company. The décor outside is fun, with barrels and numerous dog items all around. Oh yes, dogs. I am not a huge dog person, but if I were, I'd love to run the canal with my perro and then hop into here for a quick beer. The patio  is so inviting and allows you to bring the dog, with a dog wash area and biscuits waiting for them. A very relaxed and cool atmosphere, the patio really is the perfect spot for numerous occasions. Inside is equally enjoyable with tons of wide open space for a couple, or 10 buds looking to hang. Service is spot on and quite attentive. I never have had a single issue when coming out to OHSO, they really do a good job of providing top notch quality service.  ~The Downlow/Extras~ One extra for you: My favorite time to come here is on Sundays for their $10 Beer n' Brunch. For the $10 you get a great craft beer, and a super yummy, well-proportioned breakfast. Other than that, this is the best trendy spot in Arcadia for a craft beer or three. 5 stars goes out to them for Well-balanced menus, great variety amongst beer options, solid price points, and a beautiful layout to go with a great atmosphere. Come and enjoy OHSO, it will be your favorite beer spot on this side of town, I guarantee it ;-)

Remember in "The Big Lebowski" when Walter says to Larry:   "Larry, do you see what happens when you **** a stranger in the ***?"    Well, I am that stranger....lets see what happens:  ~The Good~ In a clean, convenient location, this place offers a great one-stop option for all medical imaging needs. The staff were attentive and immediately helped me when I came in for a general check on my side. Once again, good service all around, no issues wit that.  ~The Bad~ SO... I am at work yesterday and my fiance calls me. Bill in mail. Its not from SMI. It's from a collector. They are "demanding payment" of $48.79. Thats right....SMI sent me to collections for not even $50 bucks, and to top it off, I was never made aware of the balance. It's been over 3 months since the procedure was done. At the time, I provided my address, phone number and insurance carrier on that not-so little patient card they had me fill out for 30 minutes.   WHY...WHY would you collect my phone number and contact info if you are not going to call me to alert me to a billing issue? Even more of concern is why you wouldn't mail or contact me before SENDING ME TO COLLECTIONS!? I pay my bills...and now I get a collections in the mail for less than a carton of smokes?   ~The Downlow~  Customer Service...This boils down to having good customer service. As a customer service rep myself, I know personally that if I had a client whose account went not only delinquent, but into collections, and I never bothered to advise them....I'd be in line at a local job bank. The ridiculous notion that this is the case...is just unfathomable to me.  I am not sure what the original balance was, or how it even occured. Aetna never advised me an amount was over-due...and certainly I wasn't sent anything either. Obviously this will baloon if not paid. I will pay it, but not before reaming the office manager when I get the chance to. It is this office's fault on not advising me of the balance due...and if they say "oh XYZ in accounting should have followed up with you....blah blah blah", I will probably lose all my hair as I keep myself from blowing up like Pompei.  They get 2 stars for their nice office and relatively good reps working with patients....but thats me being nice.. Adios SMI, see if I use you again. All for a measily $48.79 that you could have advised me on...But nope... Not going back, and I suggest you do not either.

This...place....is....amazing. Upstairs and overlooking Mill Avenue, this has become my sports home. I truly can't say anything more about this site. The service is awesome, the prices are great, and unless your team loses, I can't say you can complain much at all about Antar's.   As an ASU alumni, they make me feel extremely comfortable. If you did not know, ASU and Antars came together and made it the official bar for ASU  Alumni   come football season. I began coming here for the NFL last year, and boy was I surprised. All the general beers are available here, and they just added Leinenkugels, a Midwest favorite. They also have solid regular prices for beers, very good general pricing for pints and larger. Specials on PBR, Coors, etc. are also too good not to note. Once again, if you are from the Midwest, this is up your alley.   But the food is where it separates itself from other bars. The food menu is varied and has a kitchen that pops out solid food. I love their soups, especially the Cream of Chicken , which uses much of the same contents as their chicken pot pie. It becomes so chunky and filling, its Cream of Chicken re-invented. They have a large variety of finger foods, but if you get beyond that you will see the difference. Keep turning their pages and you will notice. I will continually come back, so when I do get around to trying some of their finer entree's I will update. Needless to say, the quality is great. The menu will surprise you when you look through it.  The TV's are plentiful, and if you get there early enough on game day you can talk with the manager and have him hook you up with a TV and your game on it. I haven't sat outside of the bar area, but its spread out nicely and has great booths which you can utilize whenever. Finally, they have a sweet outdoor patio which is great for smokers (I am not one),  and great for people watching while enjoying a beer with the game in the background.   Go Devils, and go Antars!  -Jeff

It is weird seeing this location here, given my years spent in Gilbert. Never thought that they would ever build up the area, after so many years of promise. If I had had the capital that the owners have, I'd have done the exact same thing they are doing, because this is the perfect location for a trendy hipster joint like Postinos.  Everyone knows Postinos from their other locations, I have reviewed the others, so lets cut to the chase: Great location, you can walk around to Joyride or Zinburger (both Fox Concepts) and enjoy their different flair if its not a $20 bruschetta night and you just came in for wine. The area is continuously getting built up further and its going to turn into a powerhouse. Once again, really wish I had the capital to get rights to work with these guys, they are an amazing company and they have hit the ball out of the park on literally every location they have placed down. Also, the staff here are great. Our waiter offerred to exchange one of the listed pour bottles for a vintage that was not selling well due to price ($70 for a bottle of vino!?!), at $12 a glass.   The only issue I have which loses a star is their usage of space outside. They have a "waiting area" it seems that is made up of 6 or so very small high-top tables where you can place your wine glass. They could easily go the Culinary Dropout route and use the space for more cornhole area (which they do have in a trunk mind you), or other games. Otherwise, take out the putting green-like carpeting , put more tables out there and you will have even more space for us Spring-loving weather seekers to enjoy the outdoors.   Otherwise, this place is a homerun as always, consistent as you'd expect with Postinos.  4 stars for consistency, location, wine quality and offerings, and great staff. Amazing first or second date spot, and is usually #1 in my rotation for just that. ENJOY!

This place is outstanding. I am a UPX employee, and you have to be one or know one (hint hint) to have access....but man, you want access haha. They offer so many food stations, from healthy eats (yes please) to a make-your-own-pizza area. My favorite combo is when I hit up the Salad bar and fill up on salmon and greens combos, along with a nice warm fresh soup. They make four soups EACH day!  Another good option is either a healthy bean burger or their fresh fish of the day...yes they have a number of fish options!  They have to feed a lot of people, so its a lot of options to go around. Its amazing that they have such a healthy push at the cafe. I work across the street where they have a horrific greasy  fast food joint. Sadly most people on this side prefer the burgers they push out...ick. But at this Rev Cafe they push a lot of healthier options on everyone, especially as you walk in. As a health-nut, this is fantastic in my eyes, I wish you saw it more in general. It might give people the chance to see the "lighter side" of life and cooking. If you have a friend who works at UPX, and you happen to want to meet up for lunch, you will find something to eat, for a relatively low price made with high quality ingredients right here!

I have come in 3 times now. I think I know what I am talking about....and what I am talking about is the most healthy, organic, and delicious veggie dishes I have tasted. Rather than masking their foods with mock this and Seitan that, this place dishes out ridiculously tasty treats. Come veg out with me  ~Fud/Drink~ The food here folks...so good. They hand prepare everything in store either the day before or the day of. I mean, literally the kitchen is open you can see them preparing the dishes in front of you. Because of the sheer size of the dishes they are doling out (usually at least 6+ handmade dishes) they are prepping all day long. Luckily I have tried both their breakfast and lunch (lunch twice). For breakfast I got a tofu scramble with potatoes...SO GOOD! I had some vegan dressing (from Whole Foods) that I dipped it in once back in the office, and it was heaven in my mouth. There were no byproducts, just straight up organic firepower.  For lunch please see my pics :-) I have gotten a couple wraps along with legume-filled sides. I absolutely adored the Baba Ganouche Salad as well, btw. The best side to date is the Quinoa & Israel Couscous....it is wickedly good. No complaints with my tummy either, which happily enjoyed the deposits of fresh veggies.  I want to point out I am not a vegetarian. I am more Pescatarian than anything else, but I eat a ton of veggies. I think I do veggies really well....but Desert Roots knocks it outta the park consistently. They do have random drinks to choose from, more natural and such...I just opt for water with it being so hot out. No liquor here, btw.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Top notch service here. They welcome me each time like family and are more than willing for me to try. I see how hard they are working and always give a bit of a tip because it is such a small operation (maybe 5 people working here about?). I have come during off hours, so the atmosphere is pretty quiet, but they have a great back patio and I can guarantee this is an easy escape from the craziness on Mill. Keep that in mind, this is nothing like anything else on Mill, very quiet and relaxing space for the person who is more to themselves.   ~The Downlow/Extra~ Come here and eat some very healthy food...while not overtly realizing it :-D The staff here does an outstanding job and the quality...OH THE QUALITY.... top of the line. 5 stars goes for creativity in dishes, consistency in quality, top notch service, a quiet escape on Mill (who would've thunk it), and for proudly being vegan friendly through and through. Jefe star of approval goes out to Desert Roots!

I like trying new things. Its fun and hip. While killing some time before doing side work on a Sunday, I did a Yelp Search and *poof* Fate Brewing popped up. Lets review:  ~Fud/Drink~ The food here is pretty urban and "gastropub-ish" if you ask me. I had the Scarlet Skillet Omelet (see pic) which was very good. Everything mixed together very well, even if it looks like something your cat yacked up....it was very good. I ordered a bloody beer (they actually name it that on the menu, score) with their light ale.  All their dishes look good, prices are a tad high but the quality is there. Of the crafts they brew, all but 1 was dark or very hoppy, which is why they lose a whole star. The variety simply was not there if you like anything relatively light or refreshing.  Even the ale they gave me was a Pale Ale which, I am not a fan of. It had the traditional PA hoppy kick. It tasted good with my bloody mix in it...but still, where is the variety? The guest beers were also all very hoppy or dark, so even if I jumped over to the guest list its difficult. I know its winter, but not every winter beer HAS to be dark... I am still getting used to dark beers, so I am totally up to trying new things... but give me variety!!!  ~Atmosphere/Service~ This place has a hipster feel to it. A lot of ironic items throughout, like the tool bench drawer used to cart off used growlers or old drinks...or some of the chairs which are made out of random materials. The large stone bar-top is inviting and spacious, allowing for a lot of items to be strewn across. A comparable amount of tables are inside, as well as a short-but-sweet patio up front. Service was good, one barkeep for the lot of us at the bar on a Sunday is OK. He was helpful and gave me a couple samples to try. Nothing overwhelming in either direction...nice guy.  It definitely has an open, relaxing feel to it. Really relaxing and comforting place to head over to on a Sat-Sun morning, I feel. You won't look/feel like an alchy if you come in for a drink or two and get some brunch.  ~The Down Low~ Good solid spot to unwind, upscale in some aspects, with an emphasis on hipsterism in some areas. Come on down, its a fun place to be as you can tell that a lot of beer enthusiasts come here. They get 4 stars for fun/refreshing set-up, good mix on menu, well made craft beers, and an inviting atmosphere.

Being a man who just recently lost a ton of weight (and clothes sizes), I am in need of a new wardrobe. I am now in full "purchase mode" and procuring the best shirts, polos, pants, etc, all at the best price. I heard about Rack a couple times, and thought "Meh, if they have nothing, I only wasted about 10 minutes of my life." Well, lets just say this place is outstanding! Lets run our hands through the Pant aisle at full speed, and discuss Nordstrom Rack:  ~What to do~ Buy buy buy clothes, shoes, perfumes, accessories, etc... ALL at significantly marked down prices.  ~The Good~ THEY HAVE PENGUIN! I love....love...love this brand. I am not a clothes person persay, but holy God I love this brand. They have it marked way down, at prices which allow me to comfortably stock my closet. The prices for all the designer clothes, for that matter, are outstanding. I was giddy with excitement looking at all the magnificent deals. Everything I got was at least 50% the normal dollar  rate in regular stores or online! I picked around and was able to come out of the store with everything my heart wanted. The selection is outstanding and they do not skimp on the name brands or styles. Everyone is accounted for, and the styles are not the slightest bit garish. Also, service is fast, even with long lines. They are efficient with your time spent in the store in mind.   ~The Bad~ Although they are still marked down, the shoe selection is still pricey. I do not suggest buying the shoes, you can go online or to a shoe store to get better deals. Maybe try on the shoes you are looking for, but put them back and save your money. The jeans are also pretty expensive. I am not a jeans guy, so the dollar amounts for the jeans seemed excessive. I am pretty sure I can get the same quality jeans for a quarter of the price somewhere else. I obviously can't vouche for the womens side, they have a ton... so no comment there. That really covers it, not too bad if you ask me.  ~The Down Low~ All this said, there are many places to get marked down clothes at. I did my homework, the prices here beat markdowns online and even on E-bay for my Penguin brand. The same goes for a lot of brands, I am sure. For designer styles at marked down prices, this is the perfect spot, and its so close to my place. As for my 4-star rating, the strong variety of options, good looking clothes, large list of designer brands, and the quick efficient service keeps this place with a high rating. The poor prices on shoes and jeans knock a star off. I highly recommend shopping here. Why waste your money with markups!?! Come here, and enjoy!

I love a well placed, fun sports bar to go to before the game that day. When its well run, there is nothing better. When its poorly managed, it has "Meh" written all over it. Lets turn double play and discuss Game Seven:  ~Fud/Drink~ I must admit, I did not try food when I went. Reason being, it was pretty expensive, and I had already stretched the ol' budget for the tickets I got. I saw some people's items, and yes it does beat what you get in the stadium, but just by a little. Quality is that of a normal sports bar. I have seen much better. As for drinks, wow, so priced up. I get it, I do. They have to to make ends meet. But seriously, $6.50 for a pint? Plus, its just general across the board, so from Stella to Budweiser....its $6.50. It once again beats inside, but why bother? There is a place right down the corner that is about half this price.....hmm I wonder where...read on...  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Just like the old Sliders here, nothing much has changed. Its a nice wide open space with two levels to choose from. The outdoor patio is inviting, even in hot weather there are misters and a good amount of room to bring a group of friends. There is not much ambiance to the place, the bar area itself is wide open with a couple TV's and long bar. Not an abundance of flare or items on walls. As for service, I can only attest to the barkeeps. They were very attentive, although I went very early to the game and was one of the few there...it wasn't hard to serve me. Each of the individuals I worked with were talkative and fun, and were prompt when I asked to close out.   Extras/Rating~ Two stars are provided for location to ballpark and friendly service. I truly feel that this is place is a trap for out-of-towners. They  come to see their team and did not check it out in advance or ask the motel/hotel where to go pre-game. I went for the Orioles series, and at the first game, there was a sea of orange here. The next game, they all realized to go to another location...I did as well. For better deals, including HAPPY HOUR PRICES, go to Coach's Corner, just a stone's throw away on Jefferson. Prices for food and drinks are much cheaper, along with comparable service. I rarely shout out another business on a review, but seriously, do not waste your money for beer, it makes no sense. I see redeeming factors if you have a super large group of friends wanting a quick beer or two before/after the game. Besides that, skip Game Seven Grill and choose from a ton of other bars in the area.

Phoenix Public Market combines many things a man like me loves: Fresh produce, non-processed food, all with a localized impact. I rarely eat at chain restaurants these days because of the high quality dishes local spots like Phoenix Public turns out.  PPMC is right at the top of my Local Eats list and is a perfect spot for a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning. SO... lets delve into it a bit deeper, shall we?  ~The Good~ Besides featuring local produce, meats and others in their menu, they also feature local items in a small shop in the center of the store. From the very beginning, the owners made it very clear this is a spot by Phoenicians, and for Phoenicians. I take pride in having my own place that features the best of my home, and boy are the dishes delightful, to say the least. The layout of this spot is trendy inside. You can pick a table or even snag the bench seating in the far corner of the restaurant. They have comparable seating along the bar area to sit and drink at. You may not notice it, but there is ample room out back flush with bench seating and a blown out wall where the bar extends out further.   As for food, the breakfast is to die for. I have tried numerous options, but the simplest item on the menu, Steel Cut Oats Risotto ($7.25) is my favorite. There is more than enough oats for 3-4 sittings in this bowl, which filled me up in about 5 minutes. My father opted for the Rooster Booster ($6.75) which he devoured along with a side of Crispy New Potatoes ($2.50). For lunch, my personal favorite is The Rachel ($8.50). This sandwich offers the eater a slice of roasted turkey, sauerkraut & coleslaw, all melted together on sourdough with Swiss cheese and dressed with a light and slightly sweet house dressing. The sides they offer all the way to the right of their big board are plentiful, and I chose a huge heaping bowl of broccoli which was sautéed lightly in butter. This added to my meal substantially and I was left finishing my dish...barely. Every meal here is properly portioned, and you get your money's worth in quality and freshness.   Really quick, the Happy Hour for drinks is superb; cocktails are made fresh on the spot for $5 each and taste delicious. The bartenders sling really good drinks here guys, you can come here anytime for food, but it's also a perfect treat for Happy Hour!  ~The Bad~ I can't think of anything bad... the portions you get aren't huge. We as a society are used to huge portions for small prices. Issue is, you are probably not getting your money's worth at such restaurants. Here you get what you paid for. Lines can be long at certain times of the day, especially for breakfast. So please plan your trip accordingly. They also do not have any rum drinks on the menu, so for my fellow rum lovers, we are SOL when it comes to the bar. It does give you a chance to try something different...but still that's disappointing.  ~The Downlow~ Overall this is the quintessential 5 star spot. They are trendy and hip, the location is stellar, the community involvement is top notch, their farmers market is a fun added touch, and most of all: their food is AMAZING! All of those reasons add up to 5 stars, and a very happy Jefe. I suggest this over most breakfast eateries in Phoenix. Come an enjoy, you won't be dissapointed!

Wowzers, now this is an awesome gastropub. No ifs ands or buts about it, they have probably the best burger I have ever tasted here, ready for your enjoyment...  ~Fud/Drink~ "The Burger", as they call it on their menu, is one of the best burgers in the world...its ranked. Yep, I know. I am not a big burger person, especially in the latter part of my young life. I am much more content with a fish or chicken dish than a greasy burger. But I must say I will gladly cross the line drawn in the sand for this burger. Upon picking up an already half eaten burger, I immediately noticed the weight and density. I was floored. It is impressively heavy, packed with yummy mixed greens, shaved red onion and the choice cheese tonight being provolone. The chipotle mayo is sublime, mixing the beef together along with the pretzel bun. Overall, this definitely constitutes the afformentioned ranking...its damn good.  Plus we enjoyed the burger and beer $10 special which they offer Wednesdays. The entire tab including my lone beer I ordered on the side would have come out to over $28, however the special shaved off $2 from the burger and an additional $6+  on our bill....IMPRESSIVE! This deal is on par with other nightly specials in the area... I fail to mention the fact that the beer selection is very good, they offer enough lighter varieties for me to try, but they offer something for every beer drinker.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Inside it may seem a bit cramped, but its not...the layout is quaint and you are surrounded by fun sings and album covers of indy bands. They have a few TV's with sports on, and the patio also provides a couple TV's as well. It is darker inside than a normal food spot, which lends to The Attics trademark chill vibe. Waitress was average in speed of service, nothing to write home about. I had no real questions to ask...next time I will pick their brains more. Awesome hangout bar, really relaxed atmosphere, once again.  ~Extras/Rating~ Wednesday...$10...Beer....Burger....Special... JUST DO IT!  They get 5 stars. Why? Well, they have an amazing selection of crafts, an intimate setting and atmosphere, insanely tasty food, and heck, the best burger-beer deal in town..I mean, its the best burger and some of the best beer...IN TOWN, lol! Its a no-brainer. Bank it! Shoo-wop!

For a sports bar to succeed, they have to understand their clientele. They must get that a bevvy of different tastes will walk through their door; from the deep pocketed to those expecting deals any given time. I feel Coach's really hits a home run and understands...so lets steal home and discuss Coach's Corner Grill:  ~Fud/Drink~ Right off the bat, this place is so close to Chase Field I could literally throw a baseball and hit an entry gate. So, given that, you would think they price things up. NOPE! Happy Hour, right before the game!! I was relieved to find good prices on beer and some appetizer specials to munch on. This alone compels me to return next time I go to a game. The drink specials were good, as were the selection of beers. The food looks a tad above par a general sports bar. They have a variety of choices, general bar fare done up a tad. I will get a bite to eat next time, but the people I was sitting around enjoyed their food, no complaints I could hear of. Looking over the menu, I know for sure I will definitely return to try a meal next time.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The barkeep we had was pretty busy with all the fans in the bar, yet he kept a smile the entire time and was very talkative to me and all the Orioles fans who stopped in. Fun guy, took his time on the orders with all of us at the bar and did not ask every 5 seconds if I needed an extra one. I asked about food options next time I came in, and he was very knowledgeable about items on the menu, and pointed out his favorites. It is a smaller space, however, and this place I am sure fills up quick on weekend games. It isn't overly homely, the bar is long enough and they have walls covered with various memorabilia. Its nothing to write home about, but this isn't an issue with great service.  ~Extras/Rating~ Only extra I have is to get here early, especially on weekends. I highly recommend this bar. This bar beats any alternatives nearby, and is so close to Chase. They get 4 stars for good prices, fun and upbeat service, variety of food choices, and location to Chase Field. They "lose" a star for lack of space and ambiance. Really, those two factor out to a 4 star location in my mind, and a solid addition to the bar scene for the DBacks games.

I stumbled upon this place last night. I can't believe what I heard from the owner. The outstanding folks from SuperFarm SuperTruck make more than just their amazing Superfarm ice cream...no no no...they make a whole slew of flavors. Guess who has them? YUP! Lets Melt down to the specifics and discuss the new gem ice cream shop, Melt.  ~The Good~ Well, the owner is good buddies with the owner of Superfarm. I just realized Udder Delights is also under their tree of ice creameries...so if you like Udder Delights, check this place out! I just love the randomness of it all. A guy opens up a small, nondescript ice cream literally next  to Lost Leaf, and he just so happens to have local, amazingly tasty ice cream from Superfarms...GO FIGURE!!!  They have a ton of flavors, by the way. Right now they have a ton of sherbets and fruit-flavored ice creams. Of course they have the usual staples like chocolate, mint chocolate, and so on....but come on, they have Superfarm, which if you have yet to have it, is a hazelnut chocolate ice cream, with Nutella added. This ice cream alone is a reason to come here. Instead of tracking down Superfarm's truck or heading to Gilbert for your fix, COME HERE! The owner's also, are very relaxed, its a small business to the T. They also make smoothies out of the farm-fresh ice creams they have. Just come and try this joint, you will love it.  ~The Bad~ There really isn't too much. It is not in the nicest building, its in a re-designed home, the kind your used to at Roosevelt row. They do not have seating inside, so it may get hot if eating out in the sun. Its more of a cash n' dash if eating during the day. I see this more of an optimal spot for later in the night, if you ask me. Its in Roosevelt Row, and that is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are the person that like add-ons and toppings, they do not offer that to this point, so keep that in mind if that is a must-have.  ~The Down Low~ Overall, this is a solid 4 star spot. The amazingly kind and homely (the good kind) service, assortment of flavors, freshness of ingredients, and the fact that the ice cream is locally made all add up to 4 stars. Is it a swanky  parlor where hipsters go to? No. Is it a shop that serves ONLY local and fresh farm-made ingredients? YES. Even most local in-house shoppes fail to use such fresh sources. Melt is also open from 12 to 12...ALL DAY..So you can get your Melt on whenever you want! Melt gets the Jefe Seal of Approval! Come and enjoy!!!

I love cooking. I love cheap deals on good equipment. Cheap deals, meat (get it?) Calphalon!  ~The Good~ They have such a variety of cooking items for you to purchase...it is ridiculous. The deals are also ridiculous. I saved $120+ off of the regular price for some high quality knives and a cutting board...all with the usual 10 year warranty. Using Ikea knives for 3 years can get annoying after....3 years, lol. So popping out my new 5" Santoku to slice up my veggies for the week, I felt like Bobbie Flay slicing and dicing on my huge cutting board.   High quality items are abbound here. Whether you need some induction cookware, stainless steel, or even the general higher end non-stick, they offer everything you need. I am thrilled with the prices, once again, so this is the perfect spot for any gifts for Jefe :-D  ~The Bad~ Staff know some things, probably aren't 100% well versed on every single item there. I prefer Sur La Table for expert help...so they lose a star for really just being an outlet with very little help. I suggest doing you homework beforehand, then be pleasantly surprised with the prices you see upon showing up. Go to Sur and you will see more stoneware and nicer oven cooking options, that's the big difference you will find.  ~The Down Low~ 4 stars all around for great prices, high-end quality products, continuous deals year-round and a staff who understand their warranties/general product info. This is a great spot if you want to find a nice gift for friend...or yourself. Stop by and enjoy the array of items and good prices!

The concept is pretty abstract: A bar/restaurant.. Inside of a grocery store. Hey guys, don't worry  it'll work! Well, it does work. On many levels, this concept works. Lets pour another and discuss this new addition to the Biltmore bar scene (I know, I know. Just trust me, its an addition):  ~Fud/Drink~ First off, before I go further, they have a huge selection of local beers. If you know me, you know I love local. Its a me thing. From Papago Brewery to Four Peaks, they have 26 local beers to choose from, as well as 10 other regular brands you are used to. The prices are higher however, so keep in mind you will be paying much more....unless you do Happy Hour (4pm-6pm) when its $2 off! Beers on tap run from $5-$9...come during HH. They also do have beer flights, which during non-HH hours is a good deal when looking to try new things.   As for the food, wow, it really does taste great. I ordered the Kale Caesar Salad, which was refreshing and delightful. A citrusy Caesar dressing really tied this salad together, and after I ordered mine, I saw 5 other orders come out...its good, get it! My fiance got the Camelback Burger. It came pretty raw. Our waitress was made aware, took it straight to the kitchen, and ordered some cheesy tater tots for us (we didn't ask, she did it). After 10 minutes, her burger comes back, and the bite I had was amazing. Some type of southwestern aioli sauce added on, was outstanding. Food looks superb, everything from pizzas to even sushi, which also looked stellar. Next time, I will come in for sushi....and yes there will be a next time.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ It is a very random mix of two separate atmospheres. If you are sat inward, towards the main bar area with the taps, it feels very bar-like. You are more compact, its dimmer, it has a bar feel to it. The bar juts outward into the store, much like an airport bar. Depending on where you sit, you will get a different ambiance...It actually works well, believe it or not. Its definitely a good place to kick back with friends after work....Yep, a grocery store after work, superb place to go for a drink Jeff.  As for the waitress, she was outstanding. She comped our meal, despite us making a very small request for them to re-heat the burger. I felt uncomfortable having her comp it, it was a simple first day mistake, but I am sure they were being careful, being opening day and all...We didn't ask for the comping, but hey, she gave it to us. I ordered an extra beer and gave her a fine tip. She was very aware of the foods on the menu and also helped out a lot with beer selection. Good job on her end. The other wait staff were very attentive and quickly helped clean our plates off the table and asked if we needed anything else. Good service!  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, this is is about a 4 star spot. I however, had a 5 star experience, mainly because the service was outstanding. The food is impressive, and despite prices, I was very happy to pay what we were originally going to pay.....before it got comped. Selection is stellar, the sushi adds a different element, and it doesn't take away from the bar fare. Seriously, try the Kale Caesar...you'll agree with me later. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. But please, come during HH or to one of the daily specials I posted in the pictures...save your money!! ENJOY!

Fish and myself go together like Brick Tamland and a nice pair of slacks. I eat fish almost daily, and I for one hate going out and blowing big bucks on fish I can easily prepare at home. For less than 1/2 the price, I can do what most places do. BUT (major but) there are a handful of spots out there that get it right and I am willing to eat fish at.... Cuttlefish is one of them.  ~Fud/Drinks~ So the one kicker about this place which I found out during an Elite event the owner took part in, is that the majority of the seafare comes in fresh caught that same day. Ownership prides themselves on responsibly sourced food that tastes great and is great for you. I have had the opportunity to enjoy a bevvy of options, and can attest to the quality of the sauces and ingredients. As a fish lover, something as simple as Petra Sole can be exquisitely and masterfully cooked. No single dish lacks quality, even appetizers are fresh made. When you come in and sit down, you immediately see a really nice oyster bar. I highly suggest coming during Happy Hour (3pm-7pm EACH day) and trying some discounted oysters from this place. Really high quality stuff. On Wednesdays specifically, its 1/2 price oysters and champagne..can't beat it. Drinks by the way, are magnificent here. I enjoyed the Sake To Me cocktail primarily made up of coconut sake and tequila. It was delectable. My partner in crime enjoyed a couple cocktails, one with white cranberry's that have been soaking for 2 weeks! Holy infusion Batman! She was hankering for a 3rd before we bowed out. The bill was well worth it. We both agreed that the drinks alone were worth a drive back here....  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Service is superior to most basic restaurants, and on par with what you would expect at a high-level restaurant like this. The waiter offered up suggestions from the wine list and was personable, attentive, and kept us satisfied with solid service. Atmosphere is a hit and miss, it is very busy during happy hours, however dead hours are just that...dead. It is not Red Lobster, folks...Not everyone is eating here daily. With lightly decorations, lower lighting and an inviting bar area with marble counter-top, the restaurant has a sleek look you would expect once again from a nice Scottsdale Corridor restaurant.  ~The Downlow~ Overall, 4 stars goes out to Cuttlefish for the freshness and quality of fish, solid service, and superb happy hour options. As I come back more, they will probably earn that extra star...In time, as I say. If you are anywhere in the East Valley, you will be hard-pressed to find anything offering as fresh of fish as they do here. It is imperative you try Cuttlefish, to taste the difference and experience the quality for yourself. A great date option, it is Jefe approved gents! Come on out and enjoy the finer side of the sea!

I am so good when it comes to having date ideas now. I am, THE BEST. It's mainly Yelp's fault for making me this good. Silly Yelp. Without Yelp, places like The Perch would be non-existent for me. I would not know that I can skip the zoo and just head over to The Perch to check out elegant birds. I would not know that I have a hip, trendy, and chill roof-deck place to take my unassuming dates and look like a genius *brilliant*  I have not eaten here, to be frank. I actually only had two glasses of wine. It was my first "date" in nearly 4 years. I was on my game. The date lasted nearly 3 hours, time flew by. The ambiance upstairs kept us chatting forever, the roof-deck overlooking the revamped Chandler streets. I was not going to beer it up on a date, but I can tell you they had a great list of local craft brews ready to be consumed. I also checked out the menu, which looks pretty solid. You pay a bit for the ambiance, which is primarily a jungle-infused hipster heaven filled with trees and a party deck upstairs for the misbehaving 20-somethings. They also have a niche bar downstairs you can walk into and slap down a couple brews. This place is a chameleon: 1/3 Restaurant, 1/3 Bar, 1/3 Party Deck.  Let me make it simple for those looking for a hip place to take a date:   Gentlemen: Take your Friday night date. Your arm goes around her neck as she notices the birds frolicking in the cage. You dine outside and eat a light dinner. Then go upstairs for a couple cocktails and great conversation. You win.  Ladies: Make sure you go out with a good guy who has a great smile and is funny. Does he smell good? OK good. Don't eat too much or drink too much. Make him pay for it all, you rock. Check out the birds. If he doesn't like the birds, ditch him and go upstairs, lol.  4 stars overall for the ambiance, versatility of amenities, and great waitstaff who are attentive and personable upstairs. I can't wait to come back and try the food. If its nearly as good as I expect, I will add a 5th star. Scouts honor.

Everyone that knows me, knows knows that Hulas is my favorite bar. Ever since stepping inside the Camelback location for the first time, I knew this was the set up for me. When I heard that they were opening up a second location, I had to go Opening Night. This location does not disappoint!   ~Fud/Drink~ I really...honestly... don't know where to start. I could start with the Hawaiian-style food, like the array of tacos this place dishes out that will blow your taste buds away. My favorite tacos of all-time are here, their Ahi tuna tacos. Beyond legit and beyond comprehension with a soft seer and perfectly peppered. I could jump to their Fish cakes (only on Tiki Hour) which explode with flavor in the mouth. Boom goes the dynamite. And goodness, where do I begin with the flavors from the drinks?!?! The crowd favorite is the Mai Tai, which is nowhere near as fruity or sweet as a traditional Mai Tai. It is their best seller, however, mainly because it is a well tailored drink. Oh and the Dr. Funk will get you Funked up. I is so smooth! And how about a little bit of love to The Zombie, which I personally think is the best Zombie I've tried. I also was introduced to Pyrat Rum here, my personal favorite rum, from the One Eyed Pyrat. That is how you will find me, with a One Eyed on the rocks, light on the ginger beer. Folks, they kill it here.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ I always drink at the bar. It saves me on time, and the barkeeps are quite personable. They always offer up helpful suggestions and make sure I am feeling good. The atmosphere at this location is a bit weird, however, because there are so many options in Old Town. It will get packed for a 1 hour period then die off...only to have it get packed all of a sudden again. Needless to say, if you come during a basic off-period, its not because the place is lame...hardly that. I also love the tiki feel, its like taking a plane ride to Hawaii. There are no gimmicks or silly themes, its really a straight up dope place to have a drink with a friend or that girl you like kinda sorta ;-)  ~The Downlow/Extras~ Two extras to note: Each day during the week, minus Friday's , they have a killer special. Check the website for updates, but my personal favorite would be the Tuesday 2 for 2 night, where you get two drinks and 2 drinks for $20. I usually clean house that night. They always have a charity night on Mondays, where 10% of profits go to a charity of their choosing, SO GENEROUS! Also, they usually will have an all-day happy hour surrounding holidays, like Pre-Thanksgiving or Pre-Christmas, etc. Just to note in case family is in town, or if you are thinking about leaving town a day early....maybe wait a few hours and have a couple here, haha. This place just makes my day better knowing I can hop over anytime I want. 5 stars for the drinks, food, Tiki Time, and honestly Dana being the most personable owner in Phoenix. Spend your money here knowing it goes locally, and its a killer time. Aloha!

Wow.  Just...WOW.I have been meaning to go here, but each time I try they are too busy or almost sold out. My teammate and I stopped by and were in heaven at about 1:30 in the afternoon...read on  ~Fud~ I had the Smoked Turkey. It was the best turkey I have ever had. They smoke their turkey for hours, and make this option available to someone like me who is simply not too keen for the traditional BBQ dishes places like this produce. The Turkey came dry with a basic rub it went into the oven with, and two sides. I chose Cheese grits and some coleslaw. The cheese grits are to die for, you have to try them next time you get a plate folks.  The rest of the menu is equally amazing. The brisket which my teammate had was juicy, and her sides also complemented the dish. The prices were not too radical either, given the time and effort they went into making everything. Everything is made from scratch...EVERYTHING.  ~Ambiance/Service~ A small eating area is available to most who want to chow down and hang. It gets hot in here quickly, with the sun and airflow not helping much. It doesn't matter, its a fun little spot to kick it and enjoy killer BBQ. The staff was so kind and helpful, coming up to myself and my coworker to ensure we were happy...they apologized like 4 times about the lack of options, since they were near sold out. We got everything we wanted and more, amazing service.  ~Extraz/Rating~ Try the turkey folks. It was juicy, barely any fat and it mixes so well with the sides they offer. The staff is down to like....about 6 people it looks like. Thats right, they literally have less than 10 employees I think. The menu changes daily, and they do cater, ask for a card if you want them to help you out. Also, they have an item on the menu called The Jefe. Not really anything else to point out, just thought I would mention they have a special, and it is properly named and spelled correct. Sploosh  5 stars. 3 stars for the Best BBQ I have had out here, one star for the cheese grits, and another for kick ass service.. Truly a small operation that is all hand crafted..Come here and enjoy a new tradition in South Phoenix/Tempe-land!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed B&W! Wow. Well here comes a 5 star review: ~Fud/Drink~ The food here is honestly OK. It admittedly is overpriced and I rarely eat here because its just not worth the $ amount unless you are about to keel over from lack of food. Otherwise, eat elsewhere. If you must eat here, the best bang for your buck is to split with your date (if on one) the Ramen Burger everyone raves about. I have had it, it's pretty good...not great...good! Aside from that the drinks set this place apart.  Honestly, just go up to the bar each time you want a drink. If you are on a date, get a seat at the bar. If you can't, wait for a spot to open up. I will tell you all right now, the bartenders here can mix anything up together, just go directly to them and don't order from the waitress ever. For example: I was on a date with the most gorgeous girl on this planet, and I asked her what she'd like in a drink: something fizzy, sweet, and with pineapple. Boom, relayed this to the bartender and in about 8 minutes he concocted this amazing and tasty drink (I tried a quick sip). She was happy. I was happy she was happy. And of course, I was happiest because I had an amazing Old Fashioned to kick back with. Once again folks, the barkeeps here will make your night, no matter your drink of choice...I guarantee it. This is my #1 go-to spot for a hand craft drink in town, hands down. BTW: If you go anywhere else in metro Phoenix for an Old Fashioned, you are just being silly.  ~Service/Atmosphere~  The bartenders are great, personable, fast, and extremely knowledgeable on what they are doing. I do not like the waitresses taking my order, its just not the way I do my drinks in general. They do a great job getting your order in, no doubt...but the quality of my drink was lacking the one time I came here and ordered with the waitress. The atmosphere is outstanding as well, quaint and trendy with an old school feel to it. The old school style inside of an old office building is a perfect setting for a good old fashioned mixology bar. It is anything but your typical dive or drunk's bar... it is classy, as are their drinks and service.  ~The Downlow/Extras~ Not much more to point out...Check out their list of options before ordering, because you might want to pick and choose which base liquors you try that night. There are so many varieties it allows for you to play around and see what you may or may not enjoy. Overall 5 stars goes out for the consistency, great location in downtown phoenix, amazing bartenders, abundant options of liquor, and classy atmosphere. This is my top spot to enjoy a drink with your special someone...You shouldn't take every girl here gents, only the good one's ;-) ENJOY!

Hi, I am Jefe. Jefe likes saving money. My bank account likes me saving money. Other companies don't like me saving money. I don't like those companies. Point is, saving money is awesome, unless you are a communist. Are you a commie? If so, just keep scrolling comrade.......OK, American friends, I loved my first time at Winco. I will explain further, but in a nutshell, they have it all!  ~What to Do~ Shop till ya dr-dr-dr-drop. This chain carries everything from produce to meat to random items like Tupperware and toys for the kids....all at great prices!  ~What to Know~ Like I said, they have so much to offer. I was worried they would lack variety but I was mistaken almost immediately. I immediately checked out the healthy foods section to find numerous soy product options at lower than normal prices as well as a number of items I would never see at the regular grocery store, like Dino Kale (my personal fave). I internally price check everything, normally because I eat healthy and have specific items I am always re-purchasing. Based on experience, these prices are pretty darn low...Like $.50 less expensive tofu, which is the same brand mind you, here in comparison to anywhere else.   ~What to Watch Out For~ First, check label dates. Most items do not have a long shelf life left. Keep in mind that they have lower costs because a lot of these items may be going bad so they get them on the kickback.  A great example and something I did not notice until later when I left the store, was  the salmon I bought (at 5.98 / lb). It was old by 4 days!!!! I cooked it anyway, because from previous experience the fish is not gonna kill ya...But still, they should have pulled that item not 1...not 2.... but 4 days prior. Not good Winco! Should you come to expect old items on the shelf? No. But in general, check the expiration date ahead of time Yelpers. Some items are not as big of bargains as you might expect. Random good examples could be the almond milk and soy milk selection, which is plentiful mind you. However they had relatively the same price for all of these items as you can find at Fry's, etc.Also finally: THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. Please remember that when you go to shop and expect to blow $100 bucks and throw it on your card. Nope! They only do EBT or debit, so be prepared.  ~Whammy Time~ In all, they get 4 stars, 2 for the amazing prices on the items I identified as needs, 1 for the variety for the general public, a 1/2 star for variety in my special healthy person area, and another 1/2 star for being open 24 hours. They lose a star for not accepting credit cards, and also for the old food that was left out. Four days guys.....and they never pulled it... Geesh.   Enjoy, I will be coming back soon, once my debit account can handle it!

I do not like cake much. Its fatty, and you feel bad eating one piece, let alone going for seconds....that is unless you have THESE CAKES. Nothing Bundt Cakes has probably the most moist (YES I GOT TO SAY MOIST) cakes I have ever laid my teeth on. There is not a single thing about the cakes they have here that is not short of outstanding. The frosting is out of this world, the choc chips they add in to most cakes is a clever and tasty surprise, and you get so much for what you pay for. The Red Velvet Cake is probably the hands down best they have, although you can't go wrong.  I am not sure how much more I can say, other than you just have to try the cakes. Oh, they have great service and their turn-around time is great. Yea I have exhausted all I possibly can. Its simple, to the point. My fiance and I concur this place is so good, that we will be going to this place for our wedding cake, its that good!  Finally,  I must say that I have to stay as far away from here as possible, for fear that I will eat...wait for it... nothing bundt cakes. See what I did there?  Did ya see it?  Good... Now go try their cakes!

All of these events are just ridiculous. I mean....come on: 4 different gin drinks, enough to get me feeling "Las Vegas Good". That's a side of me you folks haven't seen since the 2013 Great Gatsby event *tips a 40 in remembrance*  Folks, this was a fun event, period. Although I nearly nodded off in the presentation of what gin is, where it comes from, and how Hendricks actually makes their gin....I pulled through! And what came out of this was an amazing opportunity to enjoy some really finely crafted cocktails. Now I am poised to be a master cocktailer.... A cock of the walk shall you say?!  I give them 5 stars all the way through for the gorgeous venue (The Gladly), the great host, the wonderful flavors of the mixers, the drink of choice (Hendricks Gin), and for giving this to me for being an Elite Member of Yelp....Why thank you so much :)
