This is a hard review to write. So I'll need to rate it on several different criteria:  The good: Hotel lobby & rooms: very beautiful, spacious and well appointed. Our family of 4 enjoyed the layout. Very much like an upgraded embassy suites - which works great for a family of 4! The valet people couldn't have been nicer.  On-site Water park - yay! 2 tall slides, a lower loopy slide (my fave) a lazy river and a wave pool. Free towels, plenty of shade, and decent chair service. Plus a good amount of self serve icy water. Very appreciated. Plus regular pools and hot tubs near your rooms.  The bad They are trying to save money in every direction, which makes it all seem very thrifty in a luxury setting. - Lots of signs and Chatter about buying a timeshare - They closed the lobby sundry store before 7:00 pm!!! Both nights!! Posted times were open weekly until 9:30. - you are charged a $40.00 resort fee per suite that covers a bunch of stuff you don't need, but includes 2 good items: free wifi (although it's slow) and free water park admission. So it's a wash for me. I don't need the free valet - its a 10' walk, nor the USA today delivered, nor a one way shuttle to the mall.  The ugly I was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time. My plan had been to stop in after our dinner (we dined in their lobby restaurant) and pick up some breakfast items, plus some wine. Instead we paid $30 for a bottle of wine at the restaurant, and $50 for breakfast room delivery. And on that, it was late, and several items were missing. We had an early appointment, and couldn't use the lobby restaurant. Total bust.  When I called the lobby reception to ask about it, they couldn't have cared less. They said "well yeah, they leave if it's dead".  The cost of keeping an employee in there is $15.00 an hour. They would have sold 100.00 based on myself, and the 2 other couples that we're not sure why it was closed. Sadly, this just points to a very inexperienced manager in the economics area. Basically, 1 customer an hour will break it even.  Would I stay here again? Yes. The Rooms are great. But it's just not a high end experience. We ate at 2 of the restaurants, and both were marginal at best.  If you have kids, stay here. But don't eat here (it's really overpriced for crappy food). And do use the coupons they give you!

Oh what a night!  We rolled out of "KA" at the MGM, and began walking the restaurants to see which menu spoke to us. My girlfriend and I decided that a lobster pot pie from Michael Mina was a MUST.  The hostess informed us that the restaurant was full, but we could sit in the bar with dinner service. This was really our lucky night... as that's where the coolest bartender (Tim) is stationed!  We nabbed the best table, where we were able to see the action in the bar, as well as watch the bustle of the casino. SWEET! Fortunately, our dinner matched our view.  Appetizer:  - Charcuterie tasting plate for 2: an Atkins designed plate of tasty meats, mustard and tiny addicting pickles. There were also the most heavenly pieces of toasted warm bread to use... which were out of this world.  Dinner:  - Maine Lobster Pot Pie: This is the show stopper people! I wasn't sure what to expect, but when they wheeled out the "Shrek-sized" pot, I almost fell off my chair! This is almost a deconstructed pot pie, as they slice off the top, lay it on the plate then pile the ingredients on top. The lobster tail is in the shell, sliced into pieces. They artfully reassemble it on the plate with the tasty veggies. Worth every penny of the $90.00 price tag. It was practically the meal AND the entertainment!  - Bacon Wrapped Scallops: cooked to perfection, and delish. The apple strings on top make the dish. They held their own to the lobster, but just weren't as cool on the presentation.  And if all of this sweet chow wasn't enough? Our prince of a bartender was making himself busy, bringing us his recommended concoctions. Their signature "Cable Car" martini was one the the best cocktails I've ever experienced. Seriously, it had carmelized sugar around the ring!!  If you're at the MGM, don't skip this dining experience. And do skip the fussy dining room in favor of the tall bar table, to the left of the entrance overlooking the casino.

Let's face it - when you go to Vegas, it's all over the top. It's not enough to be a great restaurant. You need a gimmik to make it noteworthy and to stand apart from the competition. Chef Charlie Palme's Aureole has chosen wine as their over the top signature statement.  I could talk about the food, but I would have to say it's about par with the rest of the Vegas scene. Good juicy steaks, etc. I was dining on a prix fixe menu, as I was with a large group. My options were typical (an ahi appetizer, a filet, and a nice dessert). So my knowledge of the menu is limited, but I was very happy with what they offered, and my meal.  Now, let's jump to the fun part - their take on wine.  Aureole decided not to bury their 10,000 + bottles of wine selections in a basement or cellar. Instead, they opted to encase it in an acrylic tower that spans four stories (42 feet) through the center of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you pass by this absolutely amazing tower of wine, displayed for all to see - from all four sides.   Yes, it's cool to look at. But even MORE COOL? How they retrieve the wine. A beautiful woman, dressed in a sleek black leotard is hoisted up like a trapeze artist for every bottle. She is referred to as the "Wine Angel" and she's absolutely delightful to watch. Every time a bottle of wine is ordered, it's retrieved by the Wine Angel. She's a mesmerizing acrobat as she flies up within the encased tower, plucking your order out of her acrylic Heavens.  You can also ask for the "wine tablet" which is an electronic wine menu. It sounds cooler than it is - as it had a bad user interface. I'd prefer to tip the wine angel $20.00 & tell her to reach for something tasty!  Overall - review? Do go to Aureole once - or at least walk in to see it. The wine angel is something we've all dreamed about!!

Quite simply, one of the most amazing, over the top dining experiences. We've dined at so many steak houses - as I have a meat loving hubby and 2 teen boys. So we've had our share of Flemings, Ruth's Chris, etc. but this was one of our first trips to the Scottsdale area. I can't believe this is a chain, as everything about it felt so personal.  Stand outs:  - Their signature Cosmo: made with orange vodka, shaken at the table and poured into your glass with dry ice. This drink bubbles! Ooohhh I heart this.  - lobster bisque: shell based stock, giant bowl with tons of chopped lobster. If you want the heavy cream based, this isn't it. It is a delish real deal bowl of heaven.  - shellfish tower: giant shrimp & king crab legs. Believe it or not, I'd say it was very good. But I'd rather have the other unique items.  - sides: Mac and cheese, French fries (enough to serve 10 people) and garlic mash. Kids and hubby declared the Mac and cheese the best ever.  - peppercorn crusted ahi - very very tasty (spicy)  - bone in aged filets: this is the stand out bad boy on the menu. Any sauce you want, but awesome enough to do without. 400degree plates. These are the most flavorful filets I've ever had.  - butter cake. Just bring an insulin shot, and jump off the edge to one of gods creations. Can't even describe it. 1 cake is enough for everyone. It's like a giant, sugared pound cake ring with some fresh fruit. I will NEVER come to AZ without eating one of these.  Basically, I think the chef thought "what is the most sinful dessert". Then found an angel, ripped off their halo, rolled it in sugar and torched it to make it even better. That's all I can assume. Sinful, delish, and one of the best things I ever ate.  Also - 5 star service, live music.... If I run away from home, I will live here.

We picked this place based on the photo of the salmon dinner in the hotel magazine. Yup, we did. It was FANTASTIC! They have jumped on the fresh bus, harvest their own herbs from a rooftop garden and have a changing menu. Only complaints would be that we didn't receive the bread basket or olives all the other tables got. Plus there were some service snafus (forgot coffee, brought the app 2x). But this place really shines on the menu.  - crab cakes - bacon wrapped dates - plank salmon - shrimp tacos - seared scallops - Mac and cheese with sausages - apple pop tart with toffee ice cream - lemon Cotton candy  We loved all the main dishes. The sides weren't as strong (I.e. asparagus risotto). The shrimp tacos were very yummy, but not enough for a meal. At $22.00, they were a rip off compared to the $12.00 trio of crab cakes. All in all, loved the food, and we'll return!  Bonus: validation covered 100% of parking

This is a sports bar & a great place to watch a game. Perfect for a bucket of beer, some wings & lots of noise. It's not a great place to order anything other than beer & wings. Unfortunately, we stopped in here for a quick lunch on our way to an ASU hockey game. We had 45 minutes & it wasn't enough time.  The service started fine. We had sodas pretty quickly. But then it was another 10 to order, and another 30 to get our food. The food was terrible. We ordered the cheese sticks which were cold, and not melted at all on the inside. They were served on a gross piece of lettuce that was still wet. My BLT also had the wet nasty lettuce, and bacon crumbles... not even a strip of bacon. Hubby's sammy was also gross. However my son liked his wings. All in all - don't bother with this place unless you want wings & beer.

I love this place. There, I said it.  If I could pick a secret super-hero dining tool, it would be an extending fork. I love to try everything - all of it. A perfect meal for me means I have sampled it all.... Shared with my neighbor and snagged a little something from your plate. No need here, small plates built to share means people like me are happy campers!  Although its billed as a Spanish tapas joint, it has a more American flare.  My faves of the evening: - goat cheese lollipops - ohhhh we ordered more! - steak - donuts - churros (clearly I have a dessert problem)  My not faves - - calamari - table loved it, just not my thing - paella - my muscles were a bit strong  Fantastic drinks, people watching and service. We dines with 8 people, and had a ton of dishes. The bill slit was 120 which seemed pretty good. Great value, and super convenient for the cirque show.  It didn't hurt that we sat next to a fabulous bachelorette party dressed as Air Force pilots (nice one ladies)  Ill go back. Loads of fun and great food.

I'm a believer! I really like the Cosmo. It's new, so doesn't have that nasty vegas hoar smell yet - you know that cigarette/sweat/hangover/deodorizer smell?  We upgraded our room for $40 and have a spectacular view of the bellagio fountains. They have a comfiest chair out there for you too.  Ate at STK last night and it was just awesome. The wague sliders with foi are off the hook. Same for the mashed potatoes, and the potstickers. We tried a bunch of items, but these were worth writing home about.  I wish they had a convenience store in the lobby. Somewhere to buy cheep snacks, and a 6 pack of beer. I miss that. Also, not great shopping.  The chandelier bar is very awesome. Try the verbena. It come with a flower that you eat, and it makes your mouth numb. Fun party trick!

We went in on a $2.00 Tuesday's. Everything was sticky, and the food was sub par. The cheese curds were our favorites - and we ordered some slices. So cheep diner food, with the sports theme going.

I have no idea how they make absolutely everything taste so good! I could lick the nacho skillet every time! The atmosphere is outdoor party vibe - great mix of indoor and outdoor seats. The Bloody Mary was spectacular. This place is a Tempe fave!

Topgolf is like a playground for adults! So much fun, grab a pitcher of beer, and swing some clubs. I suck at the whole golf part, but who cares? It's more like bowling - nobody is good, and nobody cares. The food isn't great (stick to the basics) but the drinks are great.  I even saw a bloody mary bar that had all the fixins - I will be back to attack that bad boy on my next trip!  The $1.00 card replacement thing is stupid, especially in this age of computers. Why not make an electric wallet item? We will overlook that for now.
