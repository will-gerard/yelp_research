We arrived at 11 am just as they were putting out the fresh hot buffet. The buffet is absolutely amazing and delish and as always the service is prompt and friendly

Probably the last time I'll come to this location . It used to be good but the last few times was awful. Service is rude and slow. They were out of broc cheese soup and panini bread mid afternoon. I just feel like it's gone downhill and I've been a regular customer for years

I love the family ambiance and good service . Also they have tofu lettuce wraps which is hard to find  in a typical Chinese restaurant

This particular Olive Garden is below par. It took 20 mins to be seated for 2 people at 3pm. There were two hostesses and two servers at the front lobby talking And goofing around while we were waiting to be seated. The food was below standard. The bread sticks were still doughy and the entrees were cold. We asked for boxes and our waitress did not bring containers for the soup and leftover bread sticks (at other OG the servers give us fresh bread and salad to go). Also at the end of our meal we had to ask for the mints instead of the usual complimentary candies that are supposed to come w the bill. I will never come back to this location .

So I'm thinking of canceling my membership here. The guys are creepy and my sticker never works so I have to wait in line for a helper . They say the same thing that I need a new sticker so I have to go into the office and get a new one. They say oh well give u a free wash . As if it's really free....I have unlimited monthly washes so they are not doin me a favor . I just find it inconvenient. Also more than half of their vacuum hoses are broken.

I have been a customer of Michele's for many years. I go to her for Botox, juvaderm, and B 12 injections. She pays attention  to detail and takes her time. She is honest about what I need or don't need. She will never sell me a product to make money. She keeps her prices competitive. I am always satisfied with the results and I would recommend Michele Hunter's service to anyone looking for a more youthful, attractive appearance at an affordable price. There are many places to chose from in Scottsdale for beauty services but I wouldn't go to anyone but her.
