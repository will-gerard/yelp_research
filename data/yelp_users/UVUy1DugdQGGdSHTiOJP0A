Who puts rice & beans ON the sizzling fajita griddle? Had to literally scrape off plate. Chicken was bland & not seasoned. Would much rather patronize Senor Taco, the little hole in the wall, down the street.

Went here for the very first time today with my love.  Nice bar atmosphere...beer was good as well as wings.  Pizza left something to be desired..Really greasy and too doughy.  The waiter was clueless- asked him for food recommendations and he said "everything" was good.  How very helpful, thank you.  We ordered a beer flight and when he brought it over,  explained he had no idea which beer was what, so we sampled blindly.  Thank goodness I love guessing games and usually win. (I liked them all, however would have been nice to know what I was drinking)  Ordered blue cheese for the wings, got ranch.  Never asked if we were interested in any more beer/drinks  or suggested dessert-just threw down the check like we were at Mel's Diner. Ok..guess we are done here?!

We have been taking our two dogs to TTTPPO  since they opened a couple years ago. They do an amazing job each and every time. I love that the dogs are not kenneled for the duration of their visit and upon pick up they are usually happily sitting in the lap of one of the owners. They treat your pets as if they are their own. Make sure you schedule your appt well in advance, because they are usually booked out a couple  of weeks.

Went one morning and had the most amazing breakfast ever!  I had cinnamon roll french toast and the bf had corn beef hash. My french toast was heavenly!!! Coffee was perfect and the server was super friendly and accommodating. The atmosophere was cozy and quaint. Will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner very soon.

Love this place! We ordered a turkey sandwich and it was huge- plenty to share. They use boar's head brands which is my fave. We also shared an amazing homemade canolli. The coffee was excellent as well. Cute little place that I would highly recommend to anyone in this neck of the woods. Hope they stay around for a very long time!
