The atmosphere, service, and food are great. However the over abundance of awful 80's love music was enough to upset my stomach. If Olivia Newton John, Whitney Houston and Air Supply is your "go-to" music genre, this place is perfect.  We'll be back but wearing headphones.

The staff is very nice but to no fault of their own, very slow. 10 minutes for anyone to come by with menu's, another 10 minutes for coffee... Maybe if the owner invested in a few more people (only 2 working) service would improve. The food and drinks are good, no complaints

The Bloody Mary, jalapeño bacon, Crazy Cowboy and especially the service were all amazing.  Can't wait to come back

The food was average and arrived to the table in a reasonable time. The server appeared irritated  when we asked for honey to go with the tea; the honey was never delivered. My bacon, cheese and jalapeño omelet arrived sans bacon. The culinary oversight is considered a felonious act by many. The server only arrived again to deliver out check; too late for bacon at this point. When I addressed the issue with the server she said "well, I always repeat the order" Bravo Sierra!  Too many other good breakfast places around here to consider returning.

Wednesday evening and just one open table which is always a good sign. Our server was very cool and attentive. We split the caprese salad as an appetizer that was delivered fast and fresh. The pizza Bianco bufula was  our entree, it was awesome. One of the servers " Todd" went out of his way to say hi, ask about our meal and invited our 5 year old son to the kitchen to pick a cookie. The atmosphere is fun and kind of eclectic. Great food and experience and can't wait to try some of the pasta dishes.
