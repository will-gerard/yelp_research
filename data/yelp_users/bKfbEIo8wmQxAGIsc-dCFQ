Eden's is a classic mom and pop American story. Immigrated from Iraq this family is born to make delicious food. The mom has a super secret recipe for rice which she will pass on to her children only through her will.  The sister is kind, warm and knowledgeable. The brother is the brains and the cool who does a great job. He's always creating new dishes to push your tastebuds. Very authentic food. Good food. Great people.

Not the brightest people of course because it's a teenage store. Not a fan horrible service. Awful when returning stuff.

I'm torn on this one. These people have some of the most delicious and authentic Chinese food in the area, but the service is below atrocious. If you are black, white, or Hispanic they will most certainly say things about you in their own language. They speak Chinese and Vietnamese. I went with a good friend of mine who is Vietnamese and they were translating all the stuff they were saying about customers in their respective language. The head lady there is one of the most unpleasant people to do business with. She's rude, grouchy, and borderline disrespectful.         Conversely, the food there is beyond authentic. I'm a foodie and I know good food. It's quality and delicious. Certain dishes you will not find anywhere else. It is simply a hole in the wall with extraordinary food. Walnut shrimp, PuPu platter, hot and sour soup, egg rolls, low mein , and of course the live seafood. It tough to give my money to to these people because the service is so substandard but those food is epic.   As long as you know all this info going in, your much better off in terms of managing expectations.

I can personally attest to Dr. Carson's character and attention to detail. He's a good person who tries to take care of his patients like they are family. I've never had any issues here and have always gotten 5 star service and work. That's why I give

Temple is a great place to meet with locals and grab a beer during games. The food is reasonably priced and it's really good. The staff is friendly and not overbearing. Other then the few crazy jets fans this place is great!

Mr. Ariel is very good at what he does. He provided a great service by installing two custom pads in my shoes right away. Very happy with his work. I wear Mezlan shoes everyday for work and he takes great care off them every time. Shoe padding, repair, or just a touch up he is great. Also happens to be a very pleasant man whom I enjoy seeing every time I go.

Really a great place to grab lunch, take out, or get a quick bite. I work right down the street and the value here is tremendous. If you want to eat healthy you don't have to loose overall flavor. These guys do it the right way and the food represents that. They are an authentic Persian family that know how to make a great meal. I'm a foodie. I have high expectations with food and this place exceeds them. Also, the beautiful lady I believe her name is Naas is very welcoming and makes you feel at home every time. Highly recommend a visit to this place.

I'm not the pickiest customer ever but I was overall very satisfied. They washed my car much better then Dannys car wash which is where i usually go. They did it by hand and they took care of my biggest pet peeve....they made sure my center console was spotless. Wasn't the most upscale facility but it certainly was a good experience. I shall go back again.

As we know Real Estate is a personal deal. It really comes down to the individual and organization you're working with. I can personally attest to Tucker's attention to detail, work ethic, & personal character.  Tucker was a Marine previously and I love his straight forward, no frills, can-do attitude. In a complicated industry its crucial to have someone that makes that process simple. The team Tucker has around is great as well. They always take care of me very expeditiously. I would recommend Tucker to a friend or a family member without question. Above and beyond that I think he is one of the best dressed Real Estate agents in town. Simply a pleasure to work with through & through!

I went to Chop Shop with some buddies on a Monday night. The manager Alex did an awful job of managing how the food went out. My order took 35 minutes and the multiple people got their food before me even though I ordered first. Once the order came out it was missing sides and toppings. After complaining multiple times the manger took a very laid back approach. He said oh there are a whole bunch of orders back there. This manager was just awful and shouldn't be in such a position. He is clearly way over his head if he can't handle a Monday night. My visit was on 5-12-14 aprox 8:20 pm.

I live at the complex where metro is located. It's a great convenient spot that locals flock to on a daily basis. Brunch is great on the weekends, coffee is always a good fresh roast. It's certainly a lively, young, eclectic, atmosphere. Great place to interact with the commuting and get some quality food. Biggest Suprise is the great wine selection. From affordable to fancy Metropolis had it all.

My buddies work @VIP mortgage. They are located on the 5th floor of one of the buildings and his whole crew go there all the time. I live across the street at the condos & I go here for coffee, lunch, and energy drinks! Love this place! Great place for lunch.... Especially if you live close!

Not only is the food tremendous but the bartender is extremely expeditious. I was cold at the bar because the fans were on. I asked Chris to turn the off and he did so quickly and with a great attitude. Candidly I was probably being difficult but he went above and beyond to make my experience more enjoyable. Couple that with phenomenal food this place is a no brainer. Deff a local favorite.

Tiana is the sweetest girl and she is there every time I go. Not only does she serve amazing ice cream you also get the best customer service experience. She's so enthusiastic about this amazing ice cream that it makes you want to come back to eat more. Good thing I have some discipline. Her and the other nice gal that work Sunday nights always take care of me, Tianna is my favorite. Amazing soft serve with and angelic smile!

I walked into this place a bit late but they still took care of me. I don't encourage people doing that but I found that to be very comforting. They made me a pie and I have to tell you it was phenomenal. Awesome place that supports local brewery's and serves great pizza. Small town feel, big time taste.
