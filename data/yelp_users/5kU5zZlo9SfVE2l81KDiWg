I have had 1 horrible experience due to one employee, however after writing a bad review and rating this place 1 star, the owner, Chad himself messaged me personally to try to understand what happened to try to fix the issue. So, I am now rating this place a 5 star because of all my previous experiences that I had and especially because of Chad. There are a lot of owners who would not go out of their way to personally understand what happened in order to fix it. Chad def made up for my one bad experience. It is because of owners like Chad that make a great and successful business.

I went there right before they closed and the staff was still very friendly even though I'm sure they wanted to hurry up and close. Sabrina was very nice and had great customer service.

Wow...I am so happy with how my hair turned out!!! Bret did such a great job on my hair. I have really dark hair and its hard to make it ashy blonde and Bret did exactly what I wanted.   I def recommend this place and ask for Bret. I am going to be a returning customer. I was so unhappy with my hair. I would literally complain about it everyday and it would ruin my day. Now I will be happy everyday. That's how much I love how my hair turned out.

This is the best shop in Phoenix...I come here often just to hang out and vape because of the environment they have. Vape & co always have such great juices, mods, and customer service. I def recommend coming to this shop.

Horrible service. I ordered a carne a safe burrito and there was no meat in my burrito and when I complained they tried to blame me and say I ordered wrong. Wow unbelievable. I love meat, I am no where near a vegetarian. All they could've done was remake my burrito...I mean it was paid for but they wouldn't...just because they think that they are dealing with drunk people from the bar
