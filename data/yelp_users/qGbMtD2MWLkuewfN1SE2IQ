This location only, the staff is rude. The waiters/waitresses are slow. My last experience at this location was for a birthday. We had 7pm reservation everyone was there we still waited an hour to be seated & then another 55min to get our food! The 63rd ave and Bell location is amazing & a much better option!!

The room smelled like smoke (non-smoking room) ac barely worked. Tv didnt work. Outlet in bathroom kept blowing the fuse. Hair drier started smoking. The room was $100 & only stayed one night...to much money & too long in this hotel.  And don't walk by yourself outside at night. I heard the pool was nice but didn't stay around to check it out!

Not the best but decent for a quick bit. Little pricey for the quality.

Great beer selection. Ask the staff about any beer & you'll get an immediate response but the food is very average & over priced.

Maui tan girls are amazing. They've added a boutique that is amazing. The beds are from beginning level to level 5. Nicole the owner is a sweetheart. They are not big corporate & I believe in supporting our local small businesses

Wonder group of people! I have a teacup chihuahua that is very sensitive. It was a Friday afternoon & something obviously wrong with my girls anal glands and no other vet had time to see my girl. Even tho they are a wellness clinic they saw my baby girl and did the procedure she needed stitched her up and gave her antibiotics. They probably saved her life!

Pure barre is by far the best full body workout. I recommend everyone to try it but you'll be hooked for life.  The instructors are all amazing. The owner gena is very personable & cares about teaching you to take care of yourself. Love pure barre

Cheyenne is very artistic. I rarely know what design I want & I always leave excited about my nails! The gel pedis are fabulous... Don't forget to add paraffin to your pedi. Highly recommend Cheyenne
