NOT MEXICAN - wish they would fix this.  I went for happy hour which is weeknights after 10pm and also earlier I believe.   You can have their amazing appetizers for only $5. You have to sit at the bar but that's great. That's where they cook the food!  Everything was delicious: seafood, meat, vegetables.  It is almost impossible to get in for dinner on a Fri/Sat night. They get busy.

I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity.  They are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible.   I cannot recommend it for lunch.

My Korean friend says this is the best there is in the Phoenix area.  Based on the clientele alone I would say they must be doing something right, it is a majority Korean Americans eating in there.  All your standards are delicious, try something new, you will not be disappointed.   Another thing I love about Korean food, is I feel good after I eat it, because it seems healthier than other Asian cuisine. More vegetables I guess.  They also serve Korean wine and barley tea. Check those out.

This is an incredible store for any Feng Shui enthusiast or someone who just wants to learn what the fuss is all about.  The owner is an incredible individual. I spent the 2013 Chinese New Year with her and about 40 of her best customers.  They sell cures and offer classes.

I cannot recommend this restaurant.  It is extremely over-priced, over-seasoned, and over-indulgent.  The decor makes absolutely no sense.   The food is local and the chef chooses in season dishes. Maybe Winter just wasn't my season.   I don't think I would go back to try it again. The waiter we had seemed miserable and completely disinterested in whether we enjoyed our dining experience.  Let me tell you my bill was $90 for 3 appetizers and 2 drinks. No entrees excited me and the desserts were extremely strange.

Not worth the price. I would not go back. Pretty unexciting.

Review based solely on the Lunch Buffet.  This buffet definitely has some features not common in other buffets.  -Extensive dessert offerings -Chai Tea -Plenty of nan  What I like the most: -Variety in the vegetarian curries and a good kick -Lamb, Goat, and Tandoori Chicken in the non-veg section  Doesn't disappoint. I recommend the room with the buffet is and not going with more than 4 people. The larger room was dark and too loud.

Great local place where the age group is not all 21 year olds.  Live music on weekends and delicious food.   Indoor and outdoor bars. Friendly staff.

Tasty food, friendly staff, I can recommend Brunch, especially on Sundays. Wow Sangria half price, what a deal!  The 3 bruchettas recommended by the waitress were deliciious: proscuitto, tomato and ricotta.  I also had the peach jelly crepes, very light and lovely. Maybe a little too much jelly, but tasty.  My friend had the polenta brunch dish and enjoyed it.  Sat outside and it was very pleasant. Towards the end they turned on the music which was a little loud. I was there to catch up with an old friend and it made it a little hard to hear.

Honest review of the food. BEWARE!  Fellow yelpers you really let me down. I have to assume that the ratings for this place are based on the drinks or pure bribery. I was in AZ so I thought it fitting to have Mexican food. This place had some of the best reviews as far as Mexican places went on yelp and I decided to check it out.  The waitress was very pleasant. and the place was pretty much empty. I showed up around 8:30PM on a Sunday in November.  ATMOSPHERE I give them kudos for the excellent music. A mix of current tunes and some 90s favorites. They also have some great TVs. Temperature wise, even with the door open, it was a tad chilly and I wore my coat. Be it known I mentioned to the hostess when I walked in it was chilly, and after no change, I let her know I was going to get my coat, which also led to no change in the temperature. Glad I had brought it.   FOOD It started out well. I had the chips and salsa (you get green and red) I am a sucker for green salsa, and this did not disappoint. You do need to ask for the chips and salsa if you want them. I'm not the first yelper to mention this. Would be good it the management got the hint and reminded their servers to offer it. I put a little of the red salsa (which is Hot) in with the green to give it a little more zing. The chips were excellent.  Since the Tacos seemed to be all the rave on yelp (maybe because they are $1 on Tuesdays) I got the platter of 2 which comes with rice and beans. Here is what I thought: -Rice - bland, (ok, i know its rice, it wasn't bad rice, just not knocking my socks off. I liked that it was soft and not dry.) -Refried beans- also pretty unexciting, but since they were the most edible thing on my plate much of it was eaten TACOS Part One -Grilled Ono Taco - this fish taco was very dry. even adding salsa/chalula couldn't save it.  I think this taco, with the fish cooked properly could be good. -Carnitas  Taco - This shredded pork taco was insanely greasy and unexciting. One bite was all I could manage. The cilantro and onions were barely discernible accompaniments.  So the waitress comes over and asks how everything is. I take a deep breath and let her know about the tacos. She sweetly asks if she can get me anything else. Still feeling optimistic I go for 2 other tacos that she recommends which are popular ones during their happy hour. She walks away.  A gentleman comes out and explains they are going to make me some replacement tacos and apologizes. I'm not sure who he actually was. No introduction was made. I told him I was optimistic and would definitely give it another shot. Just in the name of full disclosure, the waitress knew I was a yelper. I mentioned it a few times and I was taking photos of all the food she brought out.  TACOS Part Deux In general, so many toppings were piled onto these two replacement tacos I think the chef was honestly trying to mask the mediocrity of the meat. (cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - Taco Bell special) -Shredded Beef Taco -  beef still a little dry, which can be expected. Didn't taste the green chiles it was allegedly marinated in. Unexciting -Tinga taco - this shredded chicken taco was ok. It was marinated in chipotle sauce but was definitely still lacking something.  I have to say there was not an onion in sight within this 2nd round of tacos. I wonder if that's what was missing from the flavor. Lack of seasoning. I can't imagine this is how Southwesterners like this food.   Also, these two replacement tacos (which didn't come out with rice and beans because I said I did not require another serving) came out on a tiny plate. I need to mention that another Yelper has also complained that squeezing two tacos on a small plate is extremely unwieldy. I looked like a little kid spilling tomato and cheese all over the table. Chef - Please just plate the two tacos on a large plate.  I will probably go back one more time and try a few more just to make certain I didn't just have bad luck. It seems some of the other reviewers had tacos which I did not try. If my opinion does change I will make sure to update the review.  $12 with tax/tip. I had a water.

Sushi on a belt. I still don't get it. This is the lowest common denominator of sushi quality wise. Go elsewhere.

Open when you need something to be open.  Friendly staff who are happy to be there.  Delicious breakfast burrito and creative yummy hot dogs.  Be adventurous, let the cook pick and you won't be disappointed.

I've been using them for 9 months for wash/fold. The staff is amazing. They do all my weird requests and even help me get the laundry out to the car. Will miss this place.

This is my favorite local poker room. They also have affordable tournaments on Tues/Wed nights. Their hotel rooms are comfortable, and the pit bosses will bend over backwards for you.

We were very disappointed with the seafood options, especially shellfish.   Very dark inside. Take your money to the Ocean Club instead.

This salon has gotten some tough criticism but I cannot complain. Where else can you go and get a manicure/pedicure/eyebrow wax on a Saturday night and the employees will bend over backwards to get you out in a reasonable amount of time.The even stay open past closing.  I first went here when another salon said they could not accommodate me. I never have to worry about an appt and I know they appreciate their regular customers and I will not get turned away.  The owner does all the waxing to insure consistent quality. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is the least painful I have ever had. If you have to wait for waxing, be patient. These people work extremely hard and there are worst things in life than waiting 2 minutes for your eyebrow wax.  Reasonable prices as well. BEST massage chairs. BEST!

A great space where you can see a live band or sing karaoke as well as enjoy authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  Owner is passionate about what he is doing and makes sure everyone leaves satisfied. If you have any issue ask for Victor he will make it right.  Staff is super friendly and eager to help.

I would not go again. Parking was an absolute nightmare.  The value for money was just not there, and they had no where to sit or be shaded.
