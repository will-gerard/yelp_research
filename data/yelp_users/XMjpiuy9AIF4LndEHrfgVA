I agree with a previous review I read on foodnetwork who commented on the expencsive chips and guacomale. Though homemade and very fresh, I fiubd that the guacomale was too soicy for me and was made with an odd combination of crannberries on top. A bit over priced I sat in one day at the bar and ordered an iced horchata at happy hour which comes in a rediculously cool CocaCola glass bottle from the 70s or something. Unfortunately they made mine wrong b I had ask for no Kahlua being one of the rare few who dislikes coffee. But the bartender redid my drink Horchata, ice and only cream liquor. It was EXCELLENT! Usually I grab virgin horchatas around town at the Sinaloan or Mexican smaller restaurants around town. But the recipe is so amazing at Cafe Barrios. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Ice cold drinks at a good price are much needed in this hot summer weather in Phoenix, Az! So milk it up #horchata #highendmexican #cafebarrio #punintended #ricemilk #staygood #summer  Read more at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/restaurants/az/phoenix/barrio-cafe-restaurant.html?oc=linkback

Absolutely LOVE this place! FRESH, FUN & LOCAL. If the trendy dress display out front doesn't catch your eye passing by then the amazing deals and finds inside will! One day I walked in & dug thru the discount $3 box and MAGICALLY fit my booty into a sexy pair of bellbottoms. I, by the way, DO NOT normally wear jeans. And I was very satisfied with my find. I've also purxhased numerous tops snd occcationally go in for simply for mirror sess. I wish you LUCK on your adventure 2 find ur new fit what ever type of clothing /style it maybe!   SassiMissCassi

Fast service && great mixed drinks for anytime of day! (NOTE: i din't think they sell alcohol!!! Sorry no happy hour here) BUT... they do hand out vouchure for evry beverage purhased && once your card is stamped up YOU my friend have won not a buy on get one half off drink BUT a entirely FREE ICED OR HOT BEVERAGE (smoothie, tea or coffee)     P.S. You need about 10stamps on your card! But fear not, MY FRIEND every week they feature 2 Stamp Tuesday!!! Oh yeah, baby! My faves are the smoothies (strawberry banana, mixedberry or green apple) blended with icecream, which is so yummy!$5 and the award winning SOY CHIA TEA LATTE WITH BROWNSUGAR also $5

Most amazing chicken you can get anywhere I've grown up loving Chickfila chicken and now that there's one close by where I live I live it even more! The Summer Strawberry Salad is amazing as well it has chicken with strawberries and blueberries, cheese and granola! So yummy for my tummy! The only thing is they are a very religious franchise and they close on Sundays to honor their values ...which sadly is usually the day I most desire to eat there. Bummer but its all good. If its your FIRST TIME just order an original #1 chicken sandwhich make sure you have the special HONEY BBQ SAUCE and you will be dreaming all day wondering what you've been eatting all ur life! Next stop in I will be ordering a platter of chicken bits!! Oh yeah:)  SassiMissCassi

Omg! I had ordered a peachbliss with peaches, banana & kiwi instead of strawberry. I love that the boosys are less than a $1.00 extra. BUT unfortunately I dropped mine on the way home so my BF went back before thryey closed @ 9pm n got me a Bahama Mama! Phew that thing was like dropping into a vortex n finding yourself on an island hammack listening to the breeze rush thru the tall forest trees & the waves clap against giant beach rocks. please note tgat the lighter colored smoothies banana & peach DO NOT have much flavor btw & seem to taste watered down:'( acai berry has loads of flavor BUT Im sure nothing can beat the Bahama Mama (white chocolate strawberry, pineapple & coconut) #musttry #BAHAMAMAMA #whitechocolate #beachbabeinAz #smoothies #frozentreat #healthyeat #bendoverbackwards4this
