I wanted to love this place because I really loved the vibe when I walked in. Busy social good music and upbeat.Had the food not been a trio us we would be back every weekend. Our steaks were burnt the potatoes were way too strong. I'm not sure how a steak house burns a steak but it was nearly inedible.  Had we not been with friends and on our best behavior we would have sent it all back but due to it being my birthday and my friends we tried eat what we could (the middle of the steak) I'm so dissappointed. I was expecting Ruth ' s Chris taste with a club atmosphere. If I ever go back it won't be for the food

This place could be so much better if they listened. Onions are extremely strong. If someone hates them and you continuously keep forgetting to leave them out of their food , that is a quick way to lose a customer. Everytime I go there and ask for no onions I still get onions! When I complain, instead of making me a new salad , they just pick the onions off leaving the taste of them behind. I think this place has a great concept going with the fresh food and I love greek but I would rather go to greek pita across the street next to Coldstone where they never mess up my order and I enjoy my food vs gagging on an onion!

I love this place so far! I went to get my lips corrected after another place had turned them into big lumpy fish lips and Jessica was great! She used hyaluronidase to basically dissolve all the lumps they look amazing. I definitely reccomend this place and will go back!
