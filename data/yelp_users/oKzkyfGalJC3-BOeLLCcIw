As far as venues in the Valley go:  Celebrity/Marquee/Mesa Amp sit at the top of the list.  You literally CANNOT get a bad seat in Celebrity Theater. Fantastic sound set up, Light Techs do a great job, Easy Parking...direct access to Downtown and the Freeway.   Honestly, they can't get much better.

This is an all in one facility. They address Behavioral Health needs as well as Interology. I was impressed that they also had a Sonora quest lab on site and Pharmacy.   My Doctor was amazing. I do not throw around that word lightly. This was literally the most comprehensive initial visit I've ever experienced. Blood work was ordered, lungs, eyes and ears were checked. Extremely impressed with the staff, the facility and of course my Physician.   I no longer have AHCCCS but will be staying here.

I love waffles. I love hashbrowns.  This waffle house suuuuuucks. The service is piss poor and they can't get orders straight. I asked for cream for my growing cold coffee twice, I got the wrong order of hashbrowns and no syrup for my waffle.  Keep in mind I am super easy to please (that's what she said).   Our server kept her head buried down at the register for most of our meal.   Get it together.  Oh, just drive to the one on the 101 and University.

Sakana, you tricky minx...you're going to steal me away from my other sushi spots.  So many positives, I'll try to keep this short.  The owner is amazing. He spent a great deal of the night explaining where the fish was sourced, when they get their fish in, the difference between quality vs quantity ect. Once I ordered Mackrel, he told me it was from Norway, asked what other kinds of fish I liked --- Then offered me two pieces of Tuna to taste (as comparison) completely GRATIS!  Also, and I have no idea how this even happened...I was thinking out loud "I wonder if they have fresh wasabi?"  I see the owner walking toward me, and before I have a chance to inquire, he puts out a small bowl in front of me "Tada!" ...fresh wasabi!" HOW DID HE KNOW!?  The meal continues to be amazing. The fish is super fresh (he showed me a picture on his phone of the tuna he brought in that day) and the service spectacular. These folks WILL take care of you...and make sure you leave happy.  Other points of note: It was someone's birthday at the table next to me, they brought out a drum and a sang a song for her, which I thought was cute. Also, the oranges after the meal, a wonderful touch. They're cut into small segments, placed back into the orange, and served with a little toothpick to pull out each piece.  The ONLY issue: The restaurant is small, and tables crammed. But again, when we sat down at a small two seater, I think I made a face because he took our menus, and said "let me put you here..." and gave us a larger spot. Very intuitive folks who care about the quality of their product, and the people eating it.  Nicely done Sakana...very nicely done.

The Awahtukee Ra is fabulous. Avoid the Mill location (unless you're just going to drink).  Overall I would order the non-sushi, more Americanized dishes for a great meal experience. The rolls weren't very large or flavorful.  BUT, their Happy Hour is fantastic and the plating is aesthetically admirable. One dish I particularly enjoyed were the mussels in this flavorful garlic and leek broth. I ordered extra white rice on the side and make a little soup and was stuffed. Super filling and delectable.  Also, their sashimi is nice, which I always find is the mark of fresh fish at a restaurant..  Happy and pleased. Keep up the good work guys!

After reading all of the stellar reviews, I was expecting stellar.  The Good: I like that they have the Sushi Bar. The expansive dining area was aesthetically pleasing  The Bad: I just didn't like any of their other items...   I tend toward less "Americanized" Asian food, and they didn't have a wide assortment, for my liking.

I took some great photos, yeah...but, it's overpriced and not unique.  Things I love:  The look of the restaurant. Love those paper table clothes you can doodle on.  The fact that they have an opera trained singer on staff. WOAH! Amazing  Things I wasn't too stoked about: Just seemed like the Olive Garden with an extra 3 bucks on the top because there's a working fireplace in the joint. Not blown away by the food (isn't that really what I came for?)  I mean, it's clever. It seems like a really cool Italian Rustica Kitchen, so you're paying for the ambiance. If you're okay with that, go...but know that you're not going to get anything above Olive Garden quality.  Sorry : (

I can't believe I still haven't written a review for Saigon Pho...  I have been going here for about 7 years and their prices still haven't changed. That 7 years mark should tell you how great they are. I have also been to about 5 other Vietnamese places in the East Valley, but Saigon Pho keeps me coming back.  Spring Rolls - Amazing Anything else - Amazing Service - Fast and Friendly  The food is cheap, and the portions are large.   Boom.  ::drops mike::

Confession time: I worked at Jamba Juice in my younger days.   Since then, thankfully, they have upgraded and updated their high caloric and somewhat unhealthy menu (Frozen yogurt and chocolate sauce? Don't kid yourself) to include FRESH fruit juices, filled with greens like spinach and apples plus the addition of to go breakfast and lunch items.  I suspect they will continue to improve their menu as they go along.  As always: I say ask employees for their recommendations (as they know best). I got the Tropical Greens, as I was advised it was sweeter than my normal Garden Medley. I also got some crushed ice added as it cooled down the greens and added a little more volume. They also have Coconut Water refreshers in time for Summer.  Now, if they only had ORGANIC greens and such - this would be a 5 star review. Love Jamba Juice though, and will keep returning : ) Woohoo! Health in a cup!

Don't go here! Because once you do...the bar will be raised, and you will forever need/crave/save up for this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricey - But you're eating RAW FISH. It's worth it.   The Salmon Sashimi was lovely : ) Big Fan of the YellowTail.  I also, had the Beef Carpaccio (I know, I know), which was to die for...and I am a sushi snob.  The fish is super fresh, the owners were attentive. Any comments about the owner being a snob might be true...but I honestly liked the guy. It's his place, and he knows what he's talking about. Basically, he's allowed to be a snob.  Just go - You'll love it and you'll agree with all the other 5 star reviews.  Now, if you need someone to hold your hand, and artificially smile at you while you slam your sake bombers and eat your deep friend Las Vegas rolls - This might not be the place for you. Go back to Mill.

I never thought I would love a chain so much...but, I do!  The server we had was fantastic. I don't know her name, but she suggested a margarita Las Vegas style and it blew.my.mind.  Pt. 1 of the food: We got the (recommend on the menu) Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes and Mushrooms - SO GOOD.  We also had the Yellow tail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Vinaigrette and Cilantro. Very flavorful and fresh.   Overall super happy and pleased from start to finish. Fun dining experience with great food. Doesn't get much better.  (A message to the lady below...WHY would you bring your kid into a restaurant where people are smoking on the patio and there's a huge (but gorgeous) bar separating the outside from the inside? I looked at your other reviews...you just like to complain and get free stuff from management. I'm onto you.)

BJ's might not be a Mom and Mom/local establishment, but when you've found yourself at a ubiquitous Shopping Center/Movie Theater and you're hungry...it's more of an oasis than say, Sbarros? But, I digress...  The menu is crazy varied- You want something with an Asian flair, Mexican, or Italian? They've got it all --- Plus nicely crafted brews. Oh, and the notorious pizzookie.  Ask the servers what they would recommend. They're more familiar with menu...and I have yet to be steered wrong direction.

I am wondering if the people reviewing this place, positively, have had actual authentic Thai food.  I got a green curry which had cabbage (wtf) snow peas (wtf) no basil (double wtf). It's green curry which is SO Basic - Eggplant, green bell peppers, carrots and basil. Simple.  This, to me, was Chinese food masquerading as Thai.   I looked through the reviews...it seems like things are hit or miss. What should one order when they come here, I wonder?   So I guess if you want Authentic Thai Food, go elsewhere. If you're suburban and haven't a clue...enjoy?  Fail.

Total see you next Tuesdays. They charged us for 4 things... two in the bag. The orders we had were wrong. I hope the manager fires the women on the night crew.   Horribly incompetent and mean.  I love me so fillibees... but wtf. Listen to the other reviews. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Royal Taj is nostalgic for me. It was the first Indian place I went to in the Valley, so they get my return business.   A few older people work the kitchen here, and have for a decent number of years, continuing to turn out some really great, homey, Indian Food.   As said before: Get the Garlic Naan. While I suppose taste is subjective, I will recommend the Korma and the Muttar Paneer  Now, the minus 1 star: ...the decor is a little outdated. But that's so minor compared to the fact that I enjoy their food. It's also really dark inside, which I love. It adds to the overall experience.

Yo, this is strictly reviewed on Dive Criteria.   The bartender was kind, funny, and very knowledgeable. I wanted a Guiness, and my drinking companion was craving Absinthe (he cray cray...but I thought, hell, why not!?) We searched for a spot which served the Green Fairy, and wouldn't you know it, this little unassuming place Palo Verde popped up.  So, I cannot lie. I was a little nervous when I walked up. It's in a dark lot, next to a liquor store (which now that I think of it is a great plus if you want to after-party) and it had no windows...okay maybe 1 window but it's hazy as fugh. Some would/will say this adds to its charm. I suppose it does.  I think I counted 3 tables in the joint, a couple of arcade games (noice) and two pool tables. This is a strictly a drink, and chill spot. There are a few snacks available which I thought was nice to do for patrons - Chips, Popcorn, Beef Jerky, Gum, Mints ect.  Again, the owner made it a fun time. We watched a little CSI on the TV while we imbibed and chatted. It really felt like hanging out at someone's house...which I liked.  OH and the thing you musn't forget: BRING CASH (There's a Chase on Broadway and Mill if you forget).

Well,  I have been to quite a  few sushi places over the years and for the record: Sushi Kee gets it right - every time.  You know when the rice is still warm, but the fish is cool, and super fresh...how it can just cover every single taste bud and delicately melt in your mouth? ... If not, you have been to the wrong places...and I'm sorry for you.  But guess what? You still have time to make amends to your mouth!  The Kee Roll is great - Bright flavor generous size. Salmon Sashimi - Butter...delicious, buttery goodness.  Squid Salad - Bomb. Period. Hard to mess this up though. Caterpillar Roll - Order it every time I go there.  Now - I suppose if you like the deep fried overly sauced shi...."sushi" and sake bombers (WOO FIST PUMP!) you could go to Ra or Sushi 101.  But those of us who actually plan on having, well...sushi (look it up if you're still confused kids...b/c it isn't a lollipop crunch roll) should make a stop at Sushi Kee at least once.  Bottom line: You're in Arizona, we're lucky to have this quality at all.  I hear they have all you can eat sushi for $20 everyday also!

Okay, so they no longer do the All You Can Eat Deal...  BUT they have these 9.99 Combo Meal things that come with:  An Entree (I got Mackerel one time, and Ahi Poki another) + Half a roll, soup, salad, tempura and a little fruit for dessert!

Hmmm...  I don't know how they got such good reviews. Tacos were scarcely filled with the good stuff, the shells were also under fried. The beans were too runny as well.  I was so stoked to find a place near me, with good reviews. Guess I'll have to keep driving to Tempe for Taco Tuesday. I still think Fillibees on Broadway and Priest is where it's at.  Oh well!

Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!  Anyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave.   I am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast.   That's RA in a nutshell.

Omg...just shut up and take my money.  You either hate good food, or hate beer if you don't like 4 Peaks. If that's the case you're a bone head (and a slew of other things Yelp won't let me post). This is a family joint, and I digress...  Guh, a wonderful gem Four Peaks is...hidden in a Tempe neighborhood and easily accessed. They have all the space to do what they want, and that convenience is passed onto patrons.  You want to belly up to the bar? Do it. Outside Seating? They will provide, inside...yeah, duh. Service is top notch...they move fast, but still allow you to have a good, well paced, time. The Beer, well of course: It's great. The food. Get anything...all of it amazing.  My favorites though? Sunspot Ale, and the Salmon Burger/Sandwich. Heaven.  4 Peaks...While I appreciate the super fun food trucks at the other location, I'd really like to have the ability to eat some of your wonderful food there as well!  (That's right folks, they've multiplied...)

The Best Pho in the Valley. Hands down. Anyone who knows good Pho will tell you this.   No, it's not a super fancy spot. No, it's probably not the best looking restaurant No, it's not a large expanse (You'll be lucky to get a seat) Yes, it's hard to find.  But they know what they're doing. I will look past all the negative aesthetic drawbacks, and enjoy a bowl...because it's that good.  The broth is the most flavorful I have ever had the pleasure of slurping, the vegetables are the freshest I have ever snapped between my teeth, and the noodles are the most perfectly cooked (a little past el dente).  Order take out and enjoy it in the comfort of your well appointed kitchen, or living room for that matter. That's what I have done anyway.

Been to Harlow quite a few times. It's a Tempe Institution. The food is consistent and I dig the location.  I personally love their Eggs Benedict and the Vanilla coffee creamer. I know to some that's pretty lame, but a good Hollandaise and a delicious creamer can be hard to come by!  I won't prattle on in this review. If you live in Tempe you'll make it in here at some point. Relax, enjoy a homey breakfast and leave satisfied.  P.S. I've heard great things about the Chorizo and Heuvos Rancheros ; )

Ooops...I haven't reviewed Green yet. No bother, if you're reading this you're already curious about the place, and should stop in already.  This place is Mecca for Vegetarians in the East Valley, as vegetarian spots/options are hard to come by out there.   Their mock "meat" is especially great... with just the right texture, perfectly absorbing the sauce or spices it accompanies.  My favorites:  Spicy Mock Chicken Salad - Filling, spicy, fresh The Samosas - Sweet/tangy flakey Balsamic Picnic Salad - Berries berries berries! Tsoynamis - You MUST Get one...get one...just do it.  Now, the carnivores I've taken here are especially fond of the mock-meat bowls.  So...anyone you take here should come away satisfied.  They also have Brunch on Sundays with awesome vegetarian options like, a long missed favorite of mine: Eggs Benedict.  Thank you Mr. Damon Brasch.

Don't go anywhere else for dog food. This is a family owned business and they're extremely knowledgeable. You're getting top-of-the-line dog food here. PetSmart or any big chain stores will not have quality food for your pets.  I recently transitioned my dog from a grain dog food to a grain free, and they gave me samples of my pup's old food to ease him onto the new brand. P.S. He frickin LOVES the new stuff.   Do your own research discover what's best for yourself. :-)

I've been here over a dozen times and still haven't reviewed it yet. Sort of that "You don't talk during a meal because it's so delicious" - thing?  Anyway,  The owners and staff here are so freaking nice. Customer Service is such an important element to dining, that a lot of places overlook, and these folks do it well.  Traditional Thai offerings in a very relaxed, clean (thank you), and simple atmosphere.  This is the only Thai Basil, of the local chains, that makes Pad Prik King and other "off the menu" dishes -  so I keep coming back to this particular location.

Casey Moore's is like one giant house party but with much better people, and much better beer available.  The extra special vibe is due to its long/sordid history, secret upstairs breakfast room, weird Blarney Stone pee rock, inside dining nook, corner "beach"/lounge area, and hidden neighborhood location.  It wasn't until I got older that I had an honest to goodness dinner here, and that was f-ckin fabulous too.   Everyone makes it to Casey Moore's at some point...and even after those college years have become a distant memory, you can still pop in for a pint and have an equally great time (just stay inside, and avoid the ubiquitous stumblers...)

Mmm ...FEZ...  The food is delicious, the desserts are sinful, the drinks are amazing...and the service is great! (Attentive, but not aggressive/Kind but also genuine)   : )  Try the FEZ Burger (The vegetarian version is glorious: with hummus, grilled onions, ciabatta bun and black bean burger patty), and the the Rosemary and Garlic Fries (with either of the aiolis). Both are addicting. They also have really great seasonal specials, if you're interested in trying something new/venturing outside of your comfort zone.  They have a wonderful Happy Hour (and reverse) as well as Brunch Saturday/Sunday.  BEST of all: they're also open really late, which is wonderful when you really don't want after-hours drive through "food".

I will say I have been to about....15 different Chinese Food Establishments in the East Valley.  That said: I always return to China King.  If you LOVE Pei Wei....stop reading...no you can continue, but know that China King doesn't have "Fried Green Beens" or "Lettuce Wraps"   Likes: 1. The Quality of the food is amazing 2. It's not "typical" Americanized food. 3. The owner and staff are amazingly kind and brilliantly service oriented. - By this I mean, you order, you eat, and when you want something you make eye contact and they rush over. Let me state: I REALLY dislike when servers come to your table 28 times to ask how everything is. I DO like when your water is empty, and someone comes to fill it silently. China King staff are AWESOME for this alone...but I digress...  Things to try: 1. The red menu - This is the "Non-American" Menu. If you get the laminated menu, ask for the red menu. 2. Shrimp with Glazed Walnuts 3. Fresh Seafood - We're talking -they take it from the tank and cook it to your liking- fresh. 4. Beef with Black Pepper Sizzling Plate. --- It's like Chili's Fajitas fun! Sizzling goodness...mmm... 5. Using Chopsticks! - If they see you struggling, they come over and offer a fork : )  I still haven't been for Dim Sum though. This review is solely based on Dinner/Lunch alone. Frankly, I don't wake up early enough - But I WILL be there for Dim Sum soon.  Mmm...China King...

Finally!  Experienced Dim Sum and LOVED it...I just wish I had gone in with a group, because I couldn't finish everything.  What an awesome variety, also...2.50 per plate of food? Uh, yeah I'm in!   One caveat, while the lovely older woman *did* try to be helpful by suggesting SO many things, I felt like I had to keep ordering out of respect.  For example: I ended up ordering BBQed Pork Buns, and I don't even eat pork. My roommate said they were fantastic though!  Things to try: The Coconut Steamed Buns (oh jesus they're buttery and sinful!) The Shrimp Rolls (simple, but tasty!) A piping hot pot of tea with everything  For 2-5 bucks per plate you can't go wrong.

They're planning on tearing down this wonderful place due to profit seeking a-hole moves : ( The only place where they rotate out amazing indie flicks you're probably not going to see anywhere else.  Hard Candy, Short Term 12, Atonement, Hunger, Thank You For Sharing, Dallas Buyers Club, all seen here...and the list goes on.  We're SO lucky to have this place in the Valley, and now they want to get rid of it? A sad day to come...sigh.

I am going to tell you what to get to have an amazing meal: Gobi Manchurian and Batura (puff bread).   Udupi hits the mark on food, service (efficient without overly aggressive) and the music is super cool. Really! I feel like I'm in a rad Bazar somewhere.   Anyhow...give it a go. I am picky and didn't order the right things first go round, so go for what I suggest.

Literally...the worst dining experience of my life. So much went wrong (I will TRY to keep it short).  I made a reservation for 8pm, 8 people on a Saturday. I called at 5pm, giving ample notice. Walk in at 7:58 (2 minutes early) and the table isn't ready. No bother, we wait outside, chit chat but happen to notice a very sparsely occupied patio, which we could have sat at. 20 minutes later. No table. Finally at 8:40 we sit down. What use are reservations? But this isn't the worst part...  We sit and wait for another 10 minutes and are approached by a frantic server: Can I get you drinks? Sure. We order an excess. (You're about to get tipped well if you can make this happen tonight).  Waiting on the drinks...my throat is getting parched...where are the drinks? We get them another 20 minutes later (It's already 9pm folks...an hour after I was supposed to have my table). Here comes Mr. Frantic again - Brings 2 drinks...we're missing some.  He apologizes and confesses he forgot to ring in the other.. Ya kidding me? Finally drops it off. Cool...   But the fun doesn't stop there. My friend orders an appetizer. Expresses she wants THIS to be her entree...to be brought out with everyone else's. It does not happen. He just stares at the table, his mouth agape. Say something. Fix this. Send the Manager over. Do something.  Next up? I don't eat meat...I am served meat. Cool. Frantic Server Dude is now blaming someone else for this transgression and has the Manager come over to drop off my meager  portion of food. The MANAGER says nothing. Not "Sorry, not how are you this evening? Apologies n such." Just drops it off, and forces a smile. What are we doing wrong here as patrons? Am I on freaking Candid Camera?! (what happened to that show anyway...)  Ugh...At this point we all just want to shovel food down our throats and get the hell out. We do the 2 for $40 deal. Where's the dessert we ordered? Blame the Cooks Magoo has his back turned to our table, and is chatting away with his friends. This is not a joke. We sit...and sit...and sit...Ya think he would have turned around at some point to, I don't know: Check on his customers who are going to be tipping him.  Finally my friend taps him on the shoulder and asks if he can box up the dessert so we can just take it with us.  I open my leftovers today and not everything's in there. I hate this place. Hate. Slow...yet the servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. The food isn't great, that's IF they can get your order right in the first place. It's pointless getting a reservation. OH and IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.  They knew this! Their home office should really make a secret shop and see what's happening at the Mill Ave location.  Ya suck.  Don't eat here. I know it's Mill...but save yourself the 2 hour shit show I experienced.

This is my favorite Asian food buffet.   Why?  Good: Sushi - Sashimi, Rolls, Deep Fried Rolls, Nigiri. - Basically anything your little heart desires. The quality is good here (not great, it's a buffet after all). It's constantly being turned over, and for the price you pay, it's pretty amazing. Crab Legs - I don't think I am the first to remark that you get ALL you can eat crab legs here. Crab Legs...all you can eat. Dreyer's Ice Cream - Ice Cream is bomb, and here they have 8 or so flavors to try. Green Tea Ice Cream Yum! Salad Bar - I say this because they have KimChee and Squid Salad (their version of it). Which is pretty cool. Also - try the banana cookie strawberry pudding (TRUST ME). Mongolian Grill - It's all you can eat Mongolian Grill with choices like: Lamb, Squid, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp.  They also have crawfish and oysters on the half shell if you're so inclined. Beer, sake, wine is also served  : )  The Bad: Now, Truth folks ...   If you're craving Beef with Broccoli, or Orange Chicken - Go elsewhere. Those dishes don't look the best, and those who I dine with have never raved about them. I like their soups, green beans, mini dum sum situation...but their fried rice looked bleh, and the beef looked rubbery and subpar.   Also bad, kinda dirty (so don't inspect things too much).  Bottom Line-  If you're going out for cheap sushi, crab legs, Non- Americanized Asian items and/or Mongolian grill,..and maybe wanna get a little buzz going on while doing so...you've found a the spot.

Great concept!  In fact, had thought about this for so long:  Why isn't there a place WITH a drive-through that actually makes delicious, HEALTHY food?  D'Lish is it. They pride themselves on not serving coke/pepsi products, which I do quite like.   Best dirty chai of my life here. Legit. So rich, flavorful and the espresso was made perfectly. Not over steeped, not burned...not weak, just right! Well, of course their food is incredible too : ) Anything you pick will rock your socks off.  Lemme say, while my dog didn't take the treat they offered (he's a brat lol) - the fact that they offered it was so nice. These folks care about what they're doing, and do it well.  I can't wait to go back and have a meal on the delightful little patio.

Oh crap.  So good. So good that I kept saying "This is so good...so good..." while I was allowing beautifully moist, perfectly grilled, and flavorful pieces of Filet Mignon dissolve on my tongue. This was in between happy bites of grill lobster,  rich and buttery.  Yes, this meal was a bit pricey - 39 bucks from the Surf n Turf, but if I was gonna do it? I was gonna do it right. I recently started eating meat again, so we came to a Steakhouse. Sorry cows...  Anyway - Service was great, the drinks were tasty, and the food was incredible.  I recommend ending with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake for dessert, and starting with a well crafted cocktail.  Boombastic fantastic!

The building itself has that Frank Lloyd Wright 70s vibe going on...not my taste, but our City isn't very old so I can live with this minor aesthetic annoyance.  (Remember when they almost tore the Orpheum down? Not cool. Fight to keep history here folks...)  Anyway, anytime I hear people begrudgingly ask "What is there to do in Phoenix?"  I would have to suggest: We do have culture here, if you're willing to venture outside of your comfort zone and outside of the suburbs.   Phoenix is privileged enough to have an Opera Company and Ballet Company who are great at what they do. I saw the Nutcracker most recently and GOODNESS, they all had impressive resumes.  The conductor, and costume designer were definitely stand outs.    As audience members we are supremely lucky because the venue itself is small enough to ensure you will have a fantastic seat no matter where you are.  I will go back. I can't wait to go back. My soul craves this, as should yours.

It's hard to find a mechanic who is knowledgeable, without being condescending...thorough, without charging you for things they cannot explain.  But Gene is definitely one of the great ones.  He's professional, sincere, and can diagnose a problem so rapidly!    I almost feel wary writing this review, because in the Yelp world...the more people find out about a place...the busier it gets.  Right now, with Gene, I can hand my car over one day and get it back the next morning, knowing that he's going to quote me a fair price before making any crazy repairs.  I post this review...with immense hesitation but know that it's only fair to do so!  Yes, I will be returning. I have already, twice over : )

Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).    Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday!  I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi.  Recommendations: Signature Roll Squid Salad Yellowtail Collarbone Drinks, Drinks...drinks.  They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well.  1 Thing: When it's busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting.

Legit chill Irish pub so this review is based on Irish Pub criteria. It's dark and moody, it's got good food...great drinks, and good people.  Food - B+ Bordering on A. Get the mussels. Done. Drinks - B+/A- I like the availability of Irish/English brews on tap and they have cider. I am a freak for cider, but that's just me. Oh and their house wines are legit.  Seating - A++ Dark Corners, tables, Booths, High tops.  The Patio - Decent sized for what you gotta do out there. Hey, and there's a game room! Sweet.   When I used to live in Chandler this was an often visited watering hole. I kinda miss its chill vibe OH and I forgot to mention: There's a Filibee's in the parking lot. So, if you need some grub at 2:15am...you're covered.  I just decided after writing this review, I'm heading back ASAP. You dark mistress Fibber's...ya got me.

As far as Burger joints go: In and Out is perfect to me. They have a limited menu which means they're going to get it right.  Sadly, I have stopped eating meat again...so I'd really like if they had some delicious alternative to cuddly cow flesh. Still, I keep coming back for the animal fries. I know they're sooo bad for me...there's something seedy, dirty, decadent, bad and wrong about them - So of course I have to have them!  Everyone's got their fave burger place, this is mine. They're open late so that's helpful as well. Sweet : )

As far as Shopping Centers go, Tempe Marketplace is pretty great.   Since we have the luxury of great weather in Phoenix, locals (and snowbirds alike) can rejoice in getting some Vitamin D while shopping at this outdoor mall.  The selection of stores, while limited, are the good ones anyhow.  The atmosphere is fun, spirited, and lively. Maybe because it's close to ASU, there are fun places to have a drink(s), and you have a Harkins you can pop into for a little cinema magic? All I know is, I'm a fan. For those of you wanting a low key vibe, spend a few hours in the bookstore.  One last thing...the Target here stays open later than other locations (11pm). Bing bang boom!

So, I am salivating as I write this....  I usually get the red or green curry, here, both of which are amazeballs.  My bf usually gets the Cashew Chicken.  This is just...the best. The flavors are amazing! So much so...and I'm embarrassed to type this --- We drink the broth. Literally. I used to order extra rice and mix it all up...but why bother?  Their lunch specials are fanastic! You get soup, a little vegetable roll and an entree for 6.95.   Oh, word to the wise: Unless you can handle it, order a 0, or a 1 spice level. I'm serious. You aren't tough. Thai Hot is different than Mexican Food or Indian Food hot. This is serious.  Other than that, go and enjoy.

I've hit up the usual "Middle Eastern/Mediterranean" spots in Tempe (We luckily have a quite a few)...and I am so surprised that I have yet to review MedFresh.   I am enamored. Their hummus is divine, their Gyro plates are sublime. Let's talk about the fact that they have chicken and beef/lamb roasting all day...top that with their delicious red sauce (what the heck is that stuff!?)...and it's pure satisfying delight.  They also give you a little side salad, for a well balanced, complete meal.  Now, what makes them stand out? THE QUALITY. Hands-down. Some other places (which shall remain nameless, you've been there, I've been there...they're open late and you needed some drunk food fixins) serve up the nastiest cuts of chicken/beef/lamb. I rarely eat meat as is...so when I do, I don't want gristly, cold, marbley fat meat.  So here we go...in short, just try it once. What can you really lose? You'll find out it's better than the other spots, for the same price, and suddenly you don't have to eat food, while intoxicated, to appreciate it.  Win, win : )

My friends kept raving about Kabuki, so I thought I'd give them a chance, despite its mixed reviews.  After spending 104 bucks on 7 or so different rolls/drinks/beer/sake...I found their sushi to be sub par. It's like going to TGI Friday's and thinking "Man, I really want steak...I am going to a steak house...called...TGI Friday's!" - Kabuki is a chain. So, in other words - Not the best.  I really desperately tried to give them a chance, hence the mass amounts of sushi ordered. I thought "Maybe it was just THIS roll...okay maybe this NEXT roll will be good." Not so much.  The quality of ingredients were poor, as was the preparation.   Gotta say the drinks were pretty fabulous though.  Drinks - A + Firecracker Appetizer - B- Ambiance - B Sushi - D - Server - C +  2 stars  If you are a sushi lover, PASS. If you aren't too familiar with sushi and haven't yet raised the bar - Go for it...but don't say you weren't warned.

After spending a few hours perusing the aisles of Lee Lee, I decided to stop into the attached restaurant for a quick bite.  They give you A TON of food, and will tailor dishes to your liking. But I didn't feel like the food had much flavor. Everything was on the bland side.   I have, other, favorites spots for PHO/Vietnamese in the East Valley (and we have some GREAT spots)...The owner was super accommodating, which is why I am little sad writing this review.

There are not many Cajun places in the Valley...so thankfully we have Cajun Seafood Corner.    They have the usual (made with care) offerings, Shrimp Etoufee, Jambalaya, Frog Legs, Oysters (fried or on the half shell)- 11.95 for a dozen oysters! Great value.    I usually get the Sauteed Alligator (Very Good- It has this cream sauce on the side, a little spice, cilantro...I use a spoon to lap it up!) and the Oyster Poboy.  Now...let's talk about the drink specials...Happy Hour (2pm-7pm): Domestics - 1.75;  Shots - 1.75; Seasonal Brews 2.50.  This place isn't "lay your white napkin on your lap" - proper...so keep that in mind. It is, however, chill, down-home cooking in a VERY relaxed atmosphere.

Oh Mido, you're too fun. They have some of the best prices in the Valley and still haven't let go of the All-You-Can-Eat Deal! The guys behind the bar are super fun, talk them up, tip them and you'll see the enthusiasm they have for what they do.  Their fish is fresh, and the servers are quick/on their game. I've never had a bad time or meal here. It's more laid back than other places and if it's your birthday they'll bust out the overhead disco ball for a brief moment to congratulate you on staying alive for another year.  Woo! Check em out if you want a relaxed, well price sushi meal on the East Side.

Let me start my review by saying I was EXTREMELY skeptical of a revolving sushi bar. Fish...revolving, hmm...however! I read all the great reviews and sure enough: Yelpers come though again.  I love going to Teharu. You sit, the food rolls by, it's fun!  I love anything that's well made, tastes great, and is Cheap.  They have a WIDE variety of items price 1.50-2.50 PER plate. I will upload a picture later to show you just how much you can put down at this place and get away cheaply. (Cuz I can put down some sushi). The beers are huge, the portions filling and it's fresh, which is super important when eating raw fish, no?  If you're still thinking about it,  JUST GO - With prices at 1.50/2.50 per plate...you can afford to "try it."

Still a fan of Teharu.   Here's something people are missing - The sushi is on a conveyor belt, and the plates are a max of $2 bucks each. Stop expecting to see famed Scottsman Gordon Ramsay rolling up your fish and rice back there. Come in with realistic expectations.  What Teharu is: Fun Cheap Loud (but I dig that environment sometimes) Great for groups  What it isn't: Michelin rated  Put some expectations aside, or go elsewhere. For the rest of us - We'll be smart enough to order a fresh roll via the menu (yes you can) anytime something looks questionable. It's on you, if you don't do that. There's a reason the lines are out the door.

Super cute/cozy and comfortable. You have to make a reservation to eat here...but I actually appreciated it. When we sat down there was water at the table, chutney and Papadum to nosh on.  I also wasn't overly bombarded with service. Rather, they moved silently, taking plates away when needed and filling my water when low.  Overall the food was very good, and the portion sizes were VERY generous (I hope that doesn't change). They deviated a bit from the classic recipes which I actually didn't mind.   The owner seems like a sweet little lady; and it's right next door to an Indian Grocer so if you're so inclined to do a little shopping after your, meal you can.  Lastly, tableware is very classic and cute, while the decor itself is modern and clean.   I will be returning.

This place has now become my favorite Indian spot.  I have to express, again, that their system of placing a reservation is very needed and essential. Parking is extremely limited in the area (as it's a shopping center as well). I noticed a couple come in without a reservation, and were sort of put off by it.  They do have a little seating area if you forget, and wait time seems to be about 10-15 minutes or so...  That aside, let's talk about the food:  I always leave VERY full here, with leftovers for the next day. Their Kormas are divine. I will recommend the vegetarian option as it comes with cashews and golden raisins...a little spicy, sweet, and tart, and savory --- basically a perfect meal. The girls (servers) here are efficient, without being pushy, and attend to each table flawlessly.   It gets an extra star from me, today, for the decor. Restaurants really underestimate the power of nice surroundings. The Dhaba definitely took this into consideration when selecting the tableware, the lighting options, tables ect.  Oh, and P.S. get the Groupon, or check in on yelp/foursquare to score some amazing deals (I don't know why they keep doing this, because they're giving away food for free...but yeah, ya know, not complaining at the moment).

I adore Hanny's, which is ironically why I haven't reviewed them yet. This is my go to spot for special occasions i.e. my birthday last year, my New Year's Eve last year, and for delicious meals and drinks late at night.   I can't find anything wrong with Hanny's. Their pizzas are perfect, the cocktails are superb and the ambiance is dark, moody, chic, and comfortable. I can't get enough.   Sigh... I need a dirty martini and the gorgonzola slaw, stat.

I have nothing but love for The Turf.  This is one of those places where the servers/bartenders are one of the reasons that keep you coming back.  I recently celebrated my birthday, there, and two of the girls gave me a gratis piece of cake with relight candles shoved in (Which was a fun surprise when I couldn't blow them out haha). Honestly, I wasn't expecting much of anything for my birthday, there, but that extra little something was very much appreciated.  Additionally -   They're in a perfect location downtown, and right next to a convenient parking lot (hard to come by around the area) and the restaurant has the perfect mix of : High tops, low tops, booths and a bar seating area. Hell, they even have a patio to boot.   Live music on weekends is fun as well.  Le sigh...good ole Turf, like your favorite sweater...

First, it was that shit-show of a night: First Friday. Where all of suburbia exclaims "Oh, we do have things going on in Phoenix!" Moira was slammed, servers filling and refilling water cups of those who are too cheap to buy drinks, but want to take advantage of Happy Hour.  Still, the staff was smiling. They hustled and I had 3 people ask if we'd been helped. When we were seated our sever was jovial, made light of the situation and suggested we order most of our items at once so that we'd get everything promptly.   Now, while it wasn't the best sushi I'd ever had (it just wasn't). I am telling you, unequivocally, it was the servers that made my night. At the end of our meal we were approached by another server who made sure we'd had an enjoyable experience. She was extremely sincere and reminded us to come by on Thursdays where the wine is half priced, and the joint is half-filled! : )  I don't know how ya'll do it, but you're fucking rockstars!  Foodwise:   Squid Salad: Generous portion Calamari: Delicious  Avoid: White Blossom roll. I've had a baked scallop roll before. This one...tasted quite funky   : /

Their House-Made wines are not great (if you're an avid wine drinker), but when you go here for a "Wine Tasting" that's what you'll get.  I would only consider drinking or purchasing their Fruit Blended wines, as this is what they do best... Something along the lines of a sangria.  The service is chaotic, and the Manager pays more attention to her regulars than other customers. Sadly, she also doesn't have an ounce of professionalism from what I witnessed, and personally experienced. Succinctly, we had to tell her about broken glass on the floor, she asked someone to not cash a check until the next day because it might not clear, and was drinking on the job.   Her co-owner (brown haired woman), is MUCH more friendly and interested in fostering new business with potential customers.   I felt like Tabitha in the "Salon Take Over" show. Be an owner, step back and let other people run your business...sadly, you cannot.  I am not sure that this place will last long. It's a shame, because the concept is great. Seems like a lot of the good reviews are from her friends. Help her out then, and give her some constructive criticism.

I don't get the hype. It's definitely an Americanized sushi joint. Most things are fried, baked and/or swimming in sauce....  I enjoy sushi for the delicate flavors of fresh fish. The pieces of the rolls are HUGE, so you can't fit the entire piece in your mouth easily (that's what she said).  It'll do if I am in suburbia. But overall, there are better places.

Quite possibly one of the filthiest establishments I have ever been in. And this is no exaggeration. In addition, the employee who served me seemed like she wanted to end her life. I'm not sure who owns this particular franchise but my hope is that she/he does regular inspections and checks up on employees. Maybe they don't? Maybe they don't even care, hence why there's an overall sense of "idgaf" in the air.   I planned on getting a wheat grass shot but when I saw the Machine hadn't been cleaned out from the previous customer I decided not to. The menu that they had placed on the cash register was covered in what I assumed was just a random smoothie explosion. The floors were dirty, there were straws on the floor, wrappers, food remnants.   It's ground up fruit in a cup, so of course it tastes good . The 5 star reviewers, you guys should just go by yourself a blender. There is nothing special about this place. Overall they should be embarrassed.

Supporting a local business is nice, and supporting a local business that has done so well for itself that it's expanded, heck yes!  Daily specials are a plenty, and most locations have a great beer and wine selection. Happy Hour is 3-6pm... and before that you can get a pretty great lunch special for about seven bucks.  Any Thai novices out there will be pleasantly well fed, and content here.

Sweet baby Jesus/Krisha/Buddha, whoever! I love this place. Their approach is modern,  but the flavors are classic. I don't know how to express this, but their food tastes...clean: Fresh, bright, quality ingredients. They take pride in what they do here.  I eat so much from Thai Spices, that it hurts...seriously. But I can't stop eating.  Anything is good on the menu: Really Mango Sticky Rice - A+++ (Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, with tangy mango) Lemon Fish - A (Light bright and flavorful) Pad Thai (Best I have ever had was here)  I am going to stop writing since I am slowly entering a food coma.  OH and remember, when ordering Medium is Thai Medium!

I came here at 10 p.m. on a Tuesday night. I was sat on the patio and waited and waited and waited. I saw the hostess throw her arms up in exasperation when I didn't get served. I kept leaning over and staring at all the servers but no one ever came to the patio. I waited for a full 15 minutes. As I was walking out the door I noticed a manager there, so I called the restaurant. When I explained the situation to him, he gave me an apathetic response of "I'm sorry." Now I work in upper management and I thought it was weird that he didn't say anything else...just silence. So I said "You don't seem very concerned." He came back with  "I am, it's too bad you don't come back." Or something to that effect. Honestly trust the other reviews. Depending on the day you go (esp if the manager is there) total nightmare. Honestly it should be the opposite. If a manager's on site everybody should be hustling. Anybody who has had poor service, I recommend complaining to corporate.  ***Update: After I left a scathing review with Corporate the ACTUAL manager of the restaurant personally called me. She agreed with my sentiments and was upset with the supervisor and wait staff. I just really hope they get their act together...

You know that poofy eye test that scares the crap out of you? That will never happen to you at Falcon Family Eye Care. Dr. Falcon has the latest technologies that keep you from flinching anytime you get an eye exam. Additionally she's extremely knowledgeable but very warm and friendly.  Last but not least you have a wonderful front desk team that want to make sure your every need is met. I walked around trying on glasses for a good 45 minutes and together we found the best pair for my facial shape.  I've been going to Falcon Family Eye Care for about 3 or 4 years now. I truly would not go anywhere else. After I moved to Phoenix I still make that 35 minute drive to come down to Chandler. That's how fantastic she and her entire staff are.

Agreed with some of the posters...  This is one of the WORST haunted houses I have ever been to (and every year I go to a few).  At one point, you're taken into a "hallway" made of chain linked fencing...then your whole party kinda walks through it...around and around...till you get to the end. Oh, no...scary.  Lots of just...walking around. The animatronix were cool...I'll give them that.  There was this one place, near Fiesta Mall, years ago...that was amazing! Whatever happened to that place?

Oh, before you read...I didn't come for the buffet. Why on EARTH would you want to eat food that's been sitting under heat lamps all day? The integrity of the food is going to be compromised.  Stop expecting perfection at a buffet folks; ain't gonna happen.   Back to the review:  Hong Kong Asian Diner is a little unassuming place serves nice homey Chinese Cuisine. I usually think it's a good sign when I am the only white person in an "ethnic" food restaurant...and both times I have eaten here, that's been the case.  They have 2 menus (like a lot of good Chinese spots do) one for traditional eaters...and one for "Everyone else".  I asked if I could take a look at both and was questioned "Ohh, you LIKE Chinese Food?" Well, yeah! That's why I'm here.  Anyway, the ladies here are super sweet, funny and attentive. Their food is also really lovely.    I had the Buddha's feast (from the traditional menu) and the Orange Chicken (yup...the everyone else menu) and I loved both! The vegetables were crisp, tasty and weren't overwhelmed by the light sauce...and the Orange Chicken...drooling...sooo good! They slice it into these strips and flash fry it. NO heavy breading, and the sauce was super sticky, sweet, and tangy.  Washed it all down with an effervescent and cheap (nice, right?) Tsing Tao while being chatted up a few times, since I was dining alone.  I really liked these ladies, and I tell ya --- Customer Service really does go along way.

We left Macy's with two drinks on the table in order to come here. Superior in every way. The drinks are tasty and made with quality ingredients and the food is much more authentic and delicious.   They give you chips, salsa and bean dip at the start so that you can end with left overs. Oh, and they brew their own beer! Little hoppy for my taste, but nothing that a solid Margarita or Dos Equis can't fix.  The Guac is legit, and the servers are fantastic.  Get in here!

4 stars : Based on Buffet Criterion (Not a $$$ Posh Dining experience).   My new favorite Asian Buffet (Using Hong Kong Gourmet, Crazy Buffet, Pacific Seafood as comparison) Something there for everyone - Sushi, BBQ, Mongolian Grill, Tons of Seafood items, lots of Vegetarian Items (which is super hard to come by in general...let alone at buffet).   Can we talk about the fact that the food is, actually, good? At a buffet!?  Yes...and the bathrooms are large and clean. A weirdly big deal for me at buffets, but I digress.    My favorite part...they're actually cheaper than a few places, by a couple bucks.  I have yet to do check in on them again, as some other reviewers remark that they're inconsistent...but I sure hope that's not the case.

Wow, a legitimate independent...film...bar.   It's everything you're looking for in Phoenix: It's different.  Their house wines are really nice, the beer list features better than average offerings, and the prices are reasonable. They're continuing to improve: Adding more beers to the tap, releasing exclusive content, hosting great screenings/themed events.  I will leave you with this:   On Thursdays they have throw back movies like The Goonies, and they've also had screenings/events for:  Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque) and A Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage Dans La Lune) and the Sigur Ros experimental film.  Try something different for once, and just go.

This a double review of sorts:  Hookah Mania / Mijana -   Very glad to found this combo spot on the Scottsdale/Tempe Border  First, the food - Really wonderful (Portion sizes are nice, the quality is lovely. Lots of flavor and a varied amount of choices) The Drinks - Unique and inventive (CHEAP Happy Hour)  They have something for everybody:  Karaoke Hookah (Given) Belly Dancing Classes (Next door at Mijana) Comedy Night Tuesdays (Next door at Mijana)  Very Low Key, super chill.

It's a chain, it's a little overpriced and the food is mediocre. I went here after going to an event downtown. This location was insanely busy, but they did manage to get out the food quickly. Props to the kitchen on this.  Overall - Speed A- (considering) Food portion - C (Downtown? go to Seamus, or Turf, or Rose& Crown / In the East Valley? Fibber Magee's/Rula Bula/Robbie Fox's) Authenticity - D (It's supposed to be an Irish pub yeah?)  I realize it's a chain, so I probably shouldn't be so harsh in the first place.

I like everything about this place, except where it's located. That's only because I choose to live near Phoenix/Tempe and this little gem is way out in San Tan Village (Cozy American Suburbia). If I don't hear gun shots at night, it's not home. But I digress...  This little shop is superb. From the carefully, crafted, creamy creations to the modern sleek decor - They had me. The staff is exceptionally nice as well, and will let you sample until your heart's content.  I just love all the little accoutrements that each tray has. Cute little bottles of champagne in the Champagne and Strawberry Gelato, beautifully displayed Mangos, in the rich sweet mango. It's a feast for the eyes, and your palette.  Highly advise checking them out if you're in the San Tan area. One word to a Gelato virgin: It's denser and more flavorful than regular ice cream. Trust me when I tell you a small is enough.  Enjoy! : )

Great spot for indie acts, and drinking with your friends.  While I haven't had the food, I've planned a pretend meal here. You know what I'm talking about? You read the menu, fantasizing about what you'll eat there when you go next time. Hey, if a menu can inspire that, I'm bout it.  Anywho - It's mostly the people here that keep me coming back. Fun crowd always.

I am not sure how to review this place. I would give it a 4 for drinks/the bar. The drinks are CHEAP and you aren't paying a cover on Mill Avenue.  But the food? I'd give a 1. Who puts lettuce in Guacamole? 2. BLAND, Cold, and Generic. They give you a bottle of "Blow out your colon-hot" or some such at your table...but I want flavor, not an inopportune trip to the bathroom.  Even Filberto's is better if you want cheap, fast Mexican. I feel like the people who give it great reviews were drunk when they walked in and ordered to begin with.  The people who work here are really nice, though, and I'll probably stumble in here a few more times because it's on Mill.

I really like the Sushi Room! Only, I live in Phoenix...so it's a bit of a trek for me.   If you live in the East Valley and want to do something more Americanize/Urban with fun drinks, I say have a stop in. The quality is top notch and the rolls are super inventive.  Oyster snob/lover? (I am but, you don't have to be...) They have fantastic ones available. Their Happy Hour is well priced and varied (you know how other place's Happy Hours can be).  Really lovely, attentive people working here as well.  Go, and you won't be disappointed.

They took out the self serve stamp/mailing machine. So...what's the point? Now you get to wait in line. Go elsewhere if you plan on doing your own Post officing (yeah I made it up). It would be like going to the bank without an ATM.

Holy...wow. A++  Best service/Best quality ever. I was debating between buying/hiring JGM, and another company (starts with an H) and went with JGM because their door had a nicer cover. I know, that seems really insignificant...but that small aesthetic difference has made all the world.  Okay so --- The total install time was an hour and 10 minutes. First: My installer called when he was on his way, (so I had time to clear out an area/clean up ect). When he came in,  we decided on door placement placement, and spoke about moving wires if need be (no extra charge!) and I asked how long the installation would take. He said to be back in an hour, just to be safe. I took my dog on a leisurely walk and BOOM. Magic.   Here's where it really gets phenomenal: He will completely drape and tape the floor, making sure that there's not a spec of debris left after he cuts through whatever barrier the door is going into.  FLAWLESS. FLAWLESS Installation (check out my pics).  I never thought I would "nerd out" about a dog door, but this takes the cake.  The best part? They SAVED my wall in a protected box with Styrofoam and the insulation. If ever I move? They'll replace the hole in the wall ($150 to do this and I've already paid for the door...so I only have to pay for installation next time). Omg...that's if I move. This door matches my house.  Love, Call them. Done. : )

I really have nothing negative to say about Pho Cao.  Their food is consistently good, they're open SUPER late (YAY!) and they have a full bar.    What really makes me give this place 4 stars, is the owner. He cares SO much about his patrons. I see him walking around the restaurant making sure that everyone is happy.  This place is his baby, and you can tell he's there to nurture it.  Their food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.  So - Have yourself a beer, a big steaming bowl of Pho, and listen to your friends sing some karaoke (yes, they have karaoke!)

This review is based on a dinner experience (Maybe the lunch buffet is great because you get to SERVE YOURSELF).  The food, was good...but not great. The okra in the soup we ordered wasn't cooked thoroughly, and was hard. The flavors in the Samosas were nice, as was the Palak Paneer...but again, it wasn't anything I couldn't get at the Supermarket from a box.  In addition, most places include naan with your meal... but at Chutney's, they charge 2.50 for two pieces. Seems like a rip off.  Let's get to the worst part.  Our time spent in the restaurant - TWO HOURS. This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. "I think we're missing naan."  "Ohhh, right..."    "Did you need anything else?"  "Yes, the soup?"  Then at the end of our poorly timed meal, plates still filled with food, they brought the check. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert, or boxes.  Now, the guy who brings the water and bussed the table: He was on the ball! Promote him to a server position, because the girls leisurely walking around the restaurant? Can't hack it.  I miss when this place was Pasand : (

I am going to keep this short.   For those of you who have been to Teharu, you want to know how it compares:  Quality - Draw Variety: Sushi Station Wait time/Service: Sushi Station Price: Teharu  So, if I am willing to make the drive, and I have a little extra cash on hand, I will pop into Sushi Station. Otherwise, I'll be waiting to find a seat at Teharu.  If you live near this fun little place, give them a go.

Revolving sushi is such a great concept, you get to try a lot of things for little money. What I like especially about Sushi Station, is that the quality and variety is better than other revolving sushi spots.  I also feel that the staff is super kind, thorough and accommodating.   Stand outs: Baked Scallop Roll, Imagine Roll, and can we talk about their desserts? They're actually good.   OH, and Happy Hour is great! 1.50-2.00 off of their normal alcohol prices. Also, if there's something you don't see on the belt, they have a menu to draw from! Yay win, win.   Again, I absolutely love this. You get try as many things as you want, and it's super affordable.  I only wish they would expand...and open a spot in the East Valley : )

Wonderful dining experience. Lovely food/Lovely service.  It's pretty casual here also, which I appreciated.  The flavor profile of each dish was spot on, and the prices were exceptionally reasonable. One thing they do right: The meal is timed appropriately. I cannot abide food coming out at the same time, or shortly, after one's starter. Also, I didn't feel rushed at all, but when I needed to wrap the meal quickly, our server made accommodations.  The person who served us was a younger gentleman with glasses (if Management is interested in praising/promoting/training).  We started with the Garlic Hummus, which was VERY flavorful (don't plan on a full make out after this stuff). I ordered the Portobello Mushroom with Brussel Sprouts from the "Chalkboard" Menu which also came with a nicely dressed salad of pine nuts, cheese and a sweet/tangy vinaigrette. The Chocolate Torte was a LARGE portion, and very decadent. I also really enjoyed the cappuccino. Again, a large cup here - Enough for 2 to share.  41 dollars for 2 people - Which included 2 entrees, the app, dessert and coffee. Not bad at all.  I will definitely be coming back. I noticed some of the more negative reviews come from those that "take out" food...so I have no input there. Maybe go into the restaurant, sit down, and enjoy your meal.

Oh here we go again...  A "trendy" well appointed spot in Central Phoenix that seems to place more focus on the decor and drink menu than the food.  Here's the thing, if I'm ordering tapas (small bites) and I am paying the same price I would for a full sized entree...I would expect these miniscule morsels to be amazing.  They, unequivocally, were not. Seems like people are fooled by this concept and the flashiness of the place.  I have been to a similar restaurant in Mahattan, and you know? They lived up to the hype. I appreciate the concept, and bringing this to Phoenix--- but the cooks can do better. MUCH better.  Chicken - Overcooked/Dry Fish - Overpriced, fishy tasting/super breaded. Ribs - Very fatty...  I suppose had we ordered main entrees instead of the tapas we would have been more impressed? I am unsure. But I tend to like more authentic Asian spots. I appreciate classic flavors and home cooking.   Meh. A shame because the place has a very cool vibe.

The portions are wonderful, the food SO flavorful, and the quality outstanding --- If you look at my other reviews I am kind of a Thai fiend.    Also, if you look at Chanpen's other reviews there's only 1 negative review and it's because he said the food took to long to make.  These people deserve your business. They're one of the only unique ethnic spots on the South Side, and the tender love and care they take with each dish makes them a stand out.  Lemon Grass Soup (AKA Thom Yam Goong) is super fragrant and delicious Musaman Curry is super sweet, filling and decadent Thai Iced Tea is super concentrated, which is nice because you can add more milk and make it last.  Woo! So glad this place exists : )

Okay, I had to re-review because they're SO GOOD. I feel almost guilty eating this food. Their portions are huge, and they give you so much of the good stuff.  Simply: Great portions They deliver til 4pm (What other Thai place does this?) Their food is spice well/appropriately (they'll stop you if you're about to mess up) They're super nice/their Customer Service is incredible.  Let me put it this way. I have never had Green Pineapple Curry, but the person I spoke to on the phone described what I was going to experience, flavor-wise, perfectly. I ordered it with Mussels, and I got SO MANY. For Seafood eaters out there: You know it's a total bummer when you get like 5 total pieces of seafood because the restaurant wants to skimp.  Also, no issues with time here. The food was ready in 20 minutes as promised. I love them for pick up/take out.   I eat so much that I can't stop and it hurts. Yum. Yum. Yum.

It's my favorite bar on Mill. Period.  But...before you run over there I need to ask you a couple questions: Do you actually like beer, and Are you a douchebag? I just don't want anyone spoiling my happy place. Please go to Firehouse or something...I beg of you.  Anyway - They have a perfectly planned, concise menu. Decide what you feel like and they will have the most fruity, dry, hoppy, chocolatey, malty (anything) draughts and/or bottles to fulfill your desires. White Chocolate Ale? Oh, they have it. A rare Belgian Framboise? Drink it up.  If you're hesitant about beer, but still not trainwrecky enough to hang out at the other Mill spots, you can get a "beer cocktail". Promise you can't go wrong here.  Lastly (but definitely not least)...there's the food - Comforting, simple, child-hood memory evoking, local deliciousness.   The patio is perfect, the food is divine, and the beer is everything you'd want on your wishlist.  I post this with hesitation. Don't ruin my joint!

89 cent donuts, 1/2 dozen for 4.99 - NICE.  They have Thai Iced teas with Boba and some other breakfast options as well such as: Croissants with Egg and Cheese and lunch offerings like: Turkey and Ham on a Croissant or Tuna Salad. Their sandwiches remind me of the "American" sandwiches at Lee's Sandwiches (which are great btdubs).  The donuts we ordered were tasty, and their numbering system makes for ease of ordering.  Consider your neighborhood Donut joint rather than a chain.   Oh and again, two words: Drive Through.  (So day after update: I just microwaved a day old one...for 15 seconds and it"s AMAZING! Moist, flavorful, and decadent. As if I need to gain more weight. Ha.)

I came here with three of my girlfriends on Sunday for brunch as we've heard many good things. Our server was sweet, and efficient.  Overall: The food was wonderful and they had really good drinks Cons: It's small, and the patio is right off of a major road. I suppose you can trick yourself into imagining it's an ocean wave ebbing and flowing, but it is a little loud.  B-

I wish I could give them more stars. I really love revolving sushi, well sushi in general, but Teharu and Sushi Station (my favorite) are better.  What I will give them is 1 point because it's revolving sushi and 1 point because it's clean and modern inside. (Still Teharu, repaint that poop colored wall - Seriously).  Not bad, not great. 2.5 Stars realistically.

Unbelievably great to work with from start to finish.   Everyone was exceedingly kind, efficient, and courteous. They allowed me to create appointments that worked with my schedule, they offered coffee and a bag for my things (small, but makes a difference), and explained each step before they/it happened.  Couldn't have been a better experience, really! : )

This is solely a review of the casino.  Simply: This is where dreams go to die. Last gasps of hope seep out of mouths with few teeth. The yellow tombstones chatter and clank against carcinogenic objects of choice, while gray eyes haze against the fading glitter of dilated irises.   Bodies are slumped against the adult video games. A day's work given to a machine promising a way out. The gorey glory of it all. The air is stale and I'm sure I've stepped in gum.  The longer I stay the more my throat burns. I don't know if it's the grape vapors being pumped in through the vents or the cigarettes. Either way I know it's seeping into my pores, and my clothes. At least I feel an ego boost in my casual garb.   I plan my escape.  When I finally make it back out to the parking garage, the mountains are high and the moon is low. This is my only favorable experience.   I reek when I get home.   I'm sure I've caught something.

Firstly, the dudes behind the counter are legit. They know exactly what they're doing, and because the place isn't accommodating too many people, they can artfully and carefully craft their creations.   The yellowtail was some of the best I've ever had outside of Los Angeles. The sushi is light, well portioned and proportioned. I never felt like "This could use a little of this/that".  Also... what is it about that purple rice? It's subtle, but I find it to be a superior vehicle for the fish to white rice. Maybe I drank the Kool-aid, but who cares?  I'm in!  I encourage you to go. My stomach is literally growling as I write this review.

I love Bei.   It's a friendly neighborhood bar and sushi restaurant, and the owners/staff will make your experience a great one. They are fun, friendly and will encourage you to join in on some late night karaoke as well as give you recommendations of their favorite options on the menu.  They have every kind of seating imaginable (I love having those options), TVs (and will change the channel if you ask nicely), live music (on the weekends) and Happy Hour specials! My boyfriend and I ordered a bottle of sake there, and it came in a really cool ice bucket which made us happy.  Get the stuffed mushrooms and thank me later. Oh yeah, and for Vegans they have Vegan options! : )  Head over to Bei, and have a good time. You won't be disappointed.

Thank you Chef Johnny Chu for bringing this exciting cuisine to the Valley.  Walking in, the decor was modern, simple and clean. I definitely felt at peace, comfortable and ready to get down!  Things to know: You will cook your own food (which totally part of the experience and fun!) Try a little of everything, so that you can figure out your likes and dislikes.  How to: Pick your broth (We got the split pot).  Choose your protein(s), vegetable(s), and carbohydrate(s).   Don't be afraid, and ask questions. Make a little soup, or enjoy items separately.  Recommendations: The House Broth, so flavorful and layered.  Watercress, Fish Balls (or Shrimp Puffs). Just trust me. Ask about spice levels. Really, I thought I was tough.  Overall you're going to spend a little money, but think of it as a meal with a side of entertainment. Also, you're going to be taking your time.  Definitely fun for groups, but intimate enough for a night out or a date.  I'll be back! :)

Boba, empandas, slushies, grilled cheese, beer, malbec, pinot grigio - Oh My!   This place has a little of everything, and it's independently owned! Please frequent this place folks. It's a gem and the staff is amazing! The owners take pride in what they do and will suggest items to you.   We came here wanting dessert... and we're thoroughly impressed with the various offerings. They also have a house slaw that appears to be amazing.   I also noticed Honest Kids lemonade and Inca Cola. These folks gave excellent taste.
