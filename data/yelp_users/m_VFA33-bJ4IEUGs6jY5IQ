Their pastas and desserts never disappoint! I love coming here when I can. Although it's quite expensive, it's well worth it!

The food here is always so good. I've been coming here since they opened. They have a great lunch special and yummy boba you can order to go. Their sushi is a bit on the pricey side but then again they're more focused on their main entrees. If you are craving Asian food and want a nice sit down place, this is definitely a good place to go. Great drinks too!

I'm not sure what the owner does to the boba but it's the best boba place I've ever been to in AZ. The boba tastes sweet and the drinks themselves are made very well. The owner doesn't just hire anyone and makes sure the quality of the drinks remain consistent. My favorite flavor is the chocolate banana smoothie with boba. A must try! Also, if you want to combine flavors, she (the owner) will definitely let you.

The quality of the food and the service has really gone down over the years. I've been coming here for years and choose not to come anymore. The way they make the nigiri is just done poorly. Not to mention, the freshness of their fish has become questionable. The last time I was there I went with my sister and we had salmon nigiri. The salmon was cut weird, almost like a triangle, and it was falling off the rice. Normally the salmon should have the stripes visible and it should sit comfortable on top of the rice. Anyways, it tasted pretty bad because the fish didn't taste fresh or tasted like salmon at all...and it was a bit chewy... We left right after that. Please note also if you like tuna, notice that it's a brownish red...not bright red. It means it's not fresh anymore so BE CAREFUL! Don't even get me started on the service...awful!!! The staff is not too nice. With this in mind, you have been warned!

I wanted to try this place because of the good reviews...I am very disappointed...I took my boyfriend here for our anniversary and we will not be returning.  Here are the things that went wrong:  - I made reservations for 8:15pm and we were not seated until past 9pm. - My boyfriend ordered a steak as medium, but it came out well done. - The dessert with the surprise anniversary message had my name misspelled...I called twice to make sure this was right!   Don't overpay for mediocre food and bad service!

I went to check this place out because the reviews looked good. My oh my was I disappointed. There was another review that said The Street was not as good and I say they are lying! I ordered the belgian chocolate and kona mocha with boba, both blended. Both drinks were not blended all the way and the boba was tasteless. I got some donuts too but they were okay. Same as the ones you get from Frys. Save your money. Go to The Street for boba.

Fast and friendly service. I went around noon on a Wednesday and the line went by faster than the Chipotle nearby. I got the Yakitori bowl and it was delicious! Chicken, mixed veggies, ramen noodles, and Yakitori sauce. Price wasn't too bad---about $8 or $9 for a meal. A great place to have a fast and yummy lunch.

Got take out from here and they were very friendly and fast! I got the gyro wrap and it came with a salad. The salad was not as chopped as I had hoped it would be---the red onions came in large rings. The gyro wrap was delicious though! Flavor was amazing. Definitely hit the spot! The price isn't bad either. It was $8 plus tax without a drink. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area!
