I have stayed here since 1999 and I think it just gets better every time we come in to town. Service is top notch, the food is excellent and the rooms of course are beautiful with a great view. Nice quality mattresses, linens, and amenities. The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel. An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us; and when we decided to dine there, they made reservations and printed a map. Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening. We are treated so well, weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training. The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability, we did not hear "no" with out a very valid reason; and they came up with alternatives. I highly recommend this place to relax and be pampered.

This is hands down the best place for bagels... but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever. I just wish they would open on in Greenville. Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese... I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale... .n

This is a wonderful place that makes me so happy to go here! The only reason I have put one less star is because of the cost. always recommend people to visit, but is rather expensive for a family of four to go. Many museums or homes of art will offer one day a week or month at a discounted rate enabling people to experience this wonderful place. Otherwise seeing the lay out has been inspiring to my husband and I building our own compound.  It is not only wonderful to see it preserved so well, but to see the future of architecture going on!

The service was disagreeable... and it was a big bummer.  Mainly because all of there restaurants over the years have never let me down... Not only was he elusive and difficult to get any time with to ask questions or order... But when we asked about something his response was," They have improved the taste" in a tone that made it sound undesirable  or   When we asked about Ginger Stout Cake "it is just like this other dish Hot Chocolate "Boca Negra" Cake " ...  The items sound very different on the menu but the waiter felt they were the same.  The Ahi tar tar tacos... the shell was too think and was not enjoyable... that really took away from the delicate ruby red tuna...  The Blueberry Crostata was good, but nothing set it apart from a diner's baked goods.   The menu seemed boring to me, and there was not much that popped out to me.  I did not feel like I was in California, it did not give me a fresh farmers market feel I get when dining in restaurants with a "California" feel... it seemed like an up graded chain restaurant.  I like the building and interior... that was my favorite part. I would go to North next store... same owner, but better management.

Very good store, in my book. :) I have enjoyed the exception range of authors they have come into speak.  I think they do a great job for keeping an exceptional selection and prices.  It is in the same center as Trader Joe's it is a good two stop shop.  I recommend stopping in with a few hours to browse or check out the website to meet an author. could be a great cheap date :)  http://www.changinghands.com

This was a good experience for many reasons... I took my 15 year old brother in there to have a facial and they were good with him, and educated him on skin care.  It was fairly priced... it did not have all the bells and whistles of a fancy resort spa... but I don't always have all day to hang out and enjoy what they charge. A clean comfortable facility... it had a plush feel to it, but still a nice medical clean aspect.

Second time in and still pleased... I highly recommend getting there distinctively fresh and smart anti-pasta dish... Also love the grilled artichoke with the lovely house made lemon aoli...

I loved it so much on a visit back to AZ for the week I dined 3 times... Every person that went with me enjoyed it's delectable fare.. Even the Midwest steak eaters & teenage boys... I think that says a lot... Every-time here  we ordered many things off the menu and shared... So many things I fell in love with on the menu... The Kale salad, and pizzas, green tea soba noodles, and the PITA (trying to figure out the recipe)... the raw fish of the day... of course the juices... everyone was ambrosial, yes I tried them all! All was prepared so delicately and with much culinary care.  This is the type of place you go when you want to eat healthy, and still feel it is gourmet, or you are trying to turn someone on to eating healthier...  Or you have mixed eaters, picky, vegan, veg, no wheat etc.  Once again Sam Fox & his team are brilliant. I was told it took 1.5 years to plan this place... there was so much that could not (would not) be compromised... I was rather impressed that they paid for the full liquor license only to cary one organic rum and vodka... They are taking a huge money loss by sticking to the philosophy...  Also with the demand that everything be fresh, the food cost must be frightening...   I hope people give this a try... it is the most delicious well done foodie health food I have ever had... and I dine around.   yum... I miss it already.
