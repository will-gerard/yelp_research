Kids and I had the pizza and wings special. The hot wings were crispy perfect and just hot enough. The pizza came out shortly after the wings. The sauce was the best I've tasted in a long time with a hint of oregano but not overpowering. The price was definitely right and the kids gave the final seal of approval with both of them saying "we have to come back here". Needless to say, we will be back!

Great dive bar given the location.  50 cent pool tables, a decent bar menu, kareoke on Friday and Saturday and the cheapest drinks in the neighborhood.  It's definitely a little bit country but so are the regulars.

Wanted to try a couple of cupcakes here before getting a couple of dozen for a friend's luncheon.  I'm glad I only got a couple and no more.  The cupcakes literally had no taste and the frosting was more like a whipped greasy mess that left a bad after taste in my mouth.  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because at least the cupcakes were moist.   With all of the other choices in the valley, don't waste your money here.
