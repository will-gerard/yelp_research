My kids each present their own challenges. Our current teachers,  Mr Brian and Mr Justin,  are brilliant at dealing with them. We have been worth SwimKids for four years and have had mostly good teachers, some great teachers, and only a handful of disappointing experiences,  which I think is an excellent track record.  The business gives back to the community, and the family atmosphere is rare these days.  Highly recommend. One issue I have is that parking is often an issue, especially after rain.  ;-)

We made our second attempt at this restaurant in three years this week.  I was quickly reminded why we stayed away for so long, especially given that we like to support local businesses.  Basically, the food is mediocre at best.  The waitress we had last time needs some lessons (such as, learn about the beers, especially the specialty Cajun ones, don't go to the table every minute asking patrons if they are ready to order if they are still looking at the menu, ask if they want another beer if their beer is empty, refill water glasses), the cook needs to not smoke and walk through the restaurant.  The items that we had we not good.  I can see how it could be a cute little neighborhood bar, and I would probably hang out at the bar to watch sports and drink the very delicious Abita, but I will not return for the food.    From now on, my Cajun fix will be taken care of by my own two hands or a drive out to Baby Kays.  It's a bummer.

I was disappointed.  I had been meaning to go for ages, and was actually embarrassed that I hadn't gone, as I'm a big "buy local" advocate, and it's only a block from my house.  However, the establishment wasn't really that well kept up, I wasn't greeted warmly, I felt as if I were intruding on something more important (someone had to come out front from the back.)   The most important part- the cupcakes.  I went on a Friday, which was buy one, get one free.  I have to say, they all looked delicious, albeit small, and it was tough to choose.  I went with my standard red velvet (sort of the cupcake by which I judge all cupcake establishments by) and the coconut).  They were both ok.  The cake was not dry, but it wasn't really that moist, either, on either of them.  I went at about 3:00 p.m., so maybe they had been sitting out all day?  The frosting on both was good enough, but truthfully, there wasn't nearly enough of it. And did I mention that the cupcakes are small?  Good if you're on a diet, I guess, which maybe I should be, but I was in the mood to indulge.  Cupcakes are small enough as they are! In the future, I'd rather go to TopIt in Gilbert or Mind Over Batter in Tempe.  I found both places to be cleaner, the staff to be far friendlier, and the cupcakes to be bigger, moister, and with more frosting.   With that said, though, I will give them another chance.  They ARE local, and maybe it was just an off day.  I'm guessing the size of the cupcakes are pretty standard there, but the other items might be improved upon.  I like to see local businesses make it.

This is only a quick, "I haven't actually been there because of things that happened before I was able to schedule" review.  I hope to be able to go some other time and write a glowing review.  However, my attempt to schedule was really disappointing and a little annoying, so here it is.  I was thrilled to discover the "Groupon Now", and thought Bodhi Body's facial offer sounded appealing.  The offer stated it was good between 9:00 am and 1:45 PM. (or similar ending time, but the starting time was definitely 9:00 AM.)  I called a little after 9:00 AM., to a toll-free number, where I was put through a "press this number for appointments" etc. routine.  No problem.  Then I was on hold for about 5 minutes (rounding down here), where I listened to the recorded information about their practice, which all sounded great.  However, I was then routed to VOICE MAIL!  After all that waiting.  OK, that's not what I found to be the worst part, or really even the funny part.  The voice mail informed me that they were out of the office from December X to January Y for the holidays and hoped to see everyone again in the New Year, and that was pretty much it.  Seeing as it's July (and 110 degrees!), I found that kind of funny.  Anyway, I had a 9:30 doctor's appointment, so waited until after that to call back, and got a live person on the phone, who was very prompt and gracious.  Although they were booked for the day, he offered to extend the offer and to get me in on another day.  Sadly, I was unavailable for that day, so it didn't work out.  I will keep my eye out for them to put out another Groupon, because I would really like to try this business out.  The website looks fantastic, and makes the business sound like just what I need, and the Groupon would  be a great way to find out.  Basically, I think they need to fix their phone service.

I booked a cut/color/highlight after purchasing a Groupon. Usually, I look up reviews of the place of business before purchasing, but did not do so this time, as the salon was close by and I needed something done quickly.  My first pleasant surprise was the ability to book my appointment online. EVERY business should do this! The salon's online appointment system is simple to use, and pretty fool proof. I loved that I didn't have to stop what I was doing to make a call, wait for an answer, then go through my calendar with someone over the phone. This was quick - look at what they have available, pick my time, BOOM, done! Love it.  When I arrived for my appointment, I was a little surprised to find that it was in the "Signature Salon" building, which I have passed literally hundreds of times over the past several years, but never knew what it was about. Kim's salon room was easy to find, tidy, and very comfortable.  As we began our consultation, I was thrilled to hear that SHE was happy with what I wanted. I love going red with color, and so many colorists balk at that, thinking I don't know what I really want. Kim not only loved the idea, but also was able to flip right to the correct shade after she took a look at my skin tone and gauged my natural color against what I was asking for.  As for the process itself, she did it perfectly. She was very thorough, which is unusual in and of itself. I've been getting my hair done in various salons for many many years, and I don't think anyone has ever been so thorough. I liked that she combed the base color all over, because people usually miss the hair by my temples, which is the only place I have gray hair.  As for the woman herself, she was very sweet and kind, not overbearing, not pushy. She wasn't "too" chatty, as many stylists can be, but definitely showed an interest and kept the conversation flowing.  I liked her business model, and she definitely has some great ideas to keep up with current trends, both in hair styling AND as a businesswoman.  Frankly, I can't say enough good things. My hair looks fabulous, I feel awesome, and I'm thrilled to have found a local, independent business that I can continue to support.   Go see her, you won't be disappointed!
