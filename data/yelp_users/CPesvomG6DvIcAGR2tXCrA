Not the best, but definitely not the worst. Good is always consistent and reliable. Waitresses are nice, and usually on top of our needs. Food usually comes real quick. If you are looking for a solid Mexican food place, this is the right choice.

For what it is, it works. Cheap beers, nice barkeeps, and interesting clientele. Kinda feel like you might be in a Coen bros. film when you drink here.   Pool and darts and an old jukebox wailing in the back. Cash only.

Yes, it looks bad from the outside. Suck it up and give it a try. This is in my hood so the location doesn't bother me. It's a diamond in the rough.   Pizza is delicious, prices are fantastic, and the family vibe makes it all better.

3 stars on selection But 2 stars on the scratchy voiced kid yelling through the PA system me to leave the property because I was trespassing.   Like most of us, I search online for a car, and found the pickup that I was looking for here. I work all day, so late evenings are the only time I can get to a dealer without taking time off work. I've always walked around dealers at night since I was little, mainly to avoid pushy salesmen and get a chance to really inspect a car. I stopped by Chapman a few minutes ago to check out the truck, and as soon as I found it, Comic Book Guy started yelling at me to leave. Yes, I know trespassing is illegal, but should the fact I was ready to trade thousands for a truck legitimize me? An amount on a vehicle that costs more than rent-a-cop makes in a year (and it was even used!)   I won't be back to chapman. If their after hours staff are dicks, good chance the rest of them are too. Found a welcoming environment at another dealership across town.

Durant's is the old standard among the powerful and political. The best steak in Phoenix, bar none. Yes it is pricey, but it is to be expected. The service is attentive and helpful, and the support staff is always there with refills or to clean the table.   I prefer the New York Strip with baked potato and salad with the house dressing. If you like bread, you'll love the bread that comes with the meal. I usually insist on more than one loaf at the meal-gotta get my money's worth.   The ambience is fantastic and we like to take the opportunity to dress up and live like our grandparents would have if they could have afforded to eat here. As an old friend of mine says, "a great steakhouse with whorehouse wallpaper."

Quality, ambiance, and good selection.   Staff is attentive and respectful, and the prices for a coffee or pastry are comparable to surrounding places.   Only bad part, parking is tough and I'm totally not cool enough to frequent it.

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Haus Murphy's. Consistently good food and service. Fun atmosphere and staff. I prefer the goulash, which is rich and meaty. The red cabbage is tasty and sweet. The beers are strong and cold. I often visit with my German adopted-grandfather and he converses with one of the waiters fluently and it always has hilarious results.

The pros: great looking place, feels like you aren't in Phoenix. Family rags-to-riches story is a great plus.   The cons: inattentive waiter. Waited 20 minutes to be even greeted by a waiter, had to grab the support staff to flag someone down. When he finally showed up, he was underwhelming in service. Saw him three times the whole evening, and he left part of the order in the kitchen, we had to flag someone down to get the rest of it. Abondigas soup was lukewarm at best (been eating this here for years.) The food steadily has taken a dive over the past few years. Doesn't live up to the standards I've come to expect from the original restaurant.   Really disappointed. Don't plan to visit again in the future.

I've been a loyal fan of Johnnies since before I was born. The quality is consistent and always good. "Johnnie" (as it seems most people call him) is courteous and professional, and is always fun to talk with. His product is delivered quick and delicious, and is one of a kind in the midtown area. He's been in the business for 27 years and is finally closing up in March of '14-get there quick if you want to have the chance to try a great dog.

Great selection, set aside a couple of hours to do it all.   Also a plus, for a big bearded guy like me, no one follows me around thinking that I'm up to no good. I find this happens to me at some of the places in Glendale and over on the east side, but here, they are respectful, helpful, and cheery.   Only reason this is 4 stars is because some of the cheese-factor of some of the stuff. Seems like this location has more of those repros and bedazzled stuff that always ends up in an antique store.
