There very few Restaurants in Arizona that have been around for decades. That's right decades!! 50 years is no flash in the pan, in fact most restaurants fail to see a 20th birthday. There is a reason why Red Devil continues to grow throughout Arizona and the reason is quality. Everything is fresh. The pizza is awesome. I was born in Brooklyn, NY and I do really like pizza. I won't compore this to NY pizza because it is not. That being said I find it just as good as any pie I have ever had in NYC. The pizza stands alone! I have never had pizza that compares to Red Devil. The crust is not to thin and not to thick. One of my favorite parts is the outer crust, it's lite, it's got a little fluff and has a chew to it that makes it very unique and very delicious!!! All components to this pie are fresh. You can watch them "open" a pizza crust. That means you can stand in front of the pizza window and watch them take a giant dough ball and turn it into pizza crust by slapping it and throwing it in the air.   So the Pizza is excellent; But how about the rest. What Red Devil does well is stay away from pretentiousness. The dishes are classic, simple and don't come out wearing sequins. I know what I'm getting when I dine here. The food speaks for itself. Like I said, it's Chicken Parmigian and I love it for what's on the inside!! The marsala dishes are very good. I will say that the Alfredo here is some of the best I have ever had. The only problem is that sometimes this sauce can "break" that happens when the butter and heavy cream seperate. When that has happened they take it back and make a new dish. The bottom line is this place is very good and continues to prove it by staying aroound through 3 recessions and continuing to grow. You can't do that without having something people want over and over again!!

First off....I'm a rabbit! This according to every Chinese Zodiac.  I like being a rabbit. My opposite.....the cock! My wife apparently is a cock. So for eighteen years I have loved .....well, my Wife!   Dragon Palace has been around for a VERY long time. I remeber going there as a child and loving it. One of my daughters has been in gymnastics just west of this restaurant and I keep wanting to eat here again and I continually drive by without stopping. My family generally eats at Nee-House or Jade Palace but the nostalgia here had my curiousity piqued.   This past weekend I made an executive choice. "Family" I said, "We are going to Dragon Palace tonight for dinner" I was so excited. This was going to be a huge throwback to my childhood. So we arrive and so goes!  We walk up to two Chinese Red colored doors. I remember these doors being gigantic, not so big anymore when you are 6' tall. I open the door for my family to enter and the wonderfull smell wafed by my nose. Just the smell I remember, a true chinese smell. When we entered there was an old Chinese man at the front counter. I wonder if he was here 25 years ago? The lanterns adorned the rooftop just like I remember back in the eighties. Pink and blue hues were splashed on the walls. No frills, just the iconic, eclectic and stereotypical Chinese joint. So far everything is great. Now the food has to be good. And it was. I must say I was peased big time. I am a very adventurous eater usually. NOT TONIGHT. I wanted simple traditional Americanized chines fair and they hit on all levels. Wor Wonton Soup, Egg Foo Yung, Mongollion Beef, Orange Chicken, Low Mein (house), Crab Puff and Egg Rolls. Easy comfort stuff. It was very good, very fresh.   Dragon Palace always served a "treat" at the end of the meal. Ice Cream usually. Now it appears they serve a new and even better treat after the meal. Get this, Banana, wrapped in wonton skin, deep fried and drizzled with honey. Crispy, Chewy, Golden and sweet. Those little chats are off the map. Loved it and we will be back soon!!!

Big Bone.....Small Fork! Bet your wondering what I mean. Ill get to that shortly.   This was my first time eating at Tutti. it was never a place that bleeped on my radar. I mean, c'mon; It's in a Fry's strip mall. What piqued my attention was the automobiles and the line outside this joint. It looked like Goodfellas. I am noticing a Bently....Powder Blue??? A Maserati QP and an Orange Lamborghini. I told my Wife that there is something going on here. With the line and steady stream of business it was time to try.   Again, it is in a strip mall, Which is where often times you find a gem. Found one!! The inside is tiny and quaint. The flavors on the food are bold. My Wife and I went traditional. Linguini w/ Clams for her, and Veal Osso Bucco for me. Now, the rest of the story.....  My Osso Bucco took a long time to be ready....I actually like that. It was very hot, extremely tender and the stock/gravy was Killer. The Shank was roasted so well that the marrow inside was PERFECT. They put a lobster fork in the shank, something that is done in much finer Restaurants than this. I was pleasantly surprised. The Marrow was so good, so rendered that put this dish at about a 8 out of ten. The only person to come close to my Granfathers recipe of Linguini Vongole is Tutti Santi. It was excellent!! The Canoli was fair but the Sambuca that is served with every dessert  is a very, very nice accoutrement. I will be back to try something different.

Sweet Spot.......NO it's not!  C'mon, it's pink. It's got ice cream inside. It's retro. Everything here screams "this place is Tubular, Hip, Rad, Cool, Tight, Phat" So whats the deal?  First off, I was under the impression they had homemade ice cream. They don't. It's Dreyers. With canned whipped toppings, canned cherries, canned sauces.....nothing here is unique!  Aha, besides the decor! I blew through 1500 calories + for garbage. I was very dissapointed. So let me get on to the dish I had. I ate half of "The Top Hat". Described as a creampuff stuffed with rich vanilla ice cream and covered with hot chocolate. Sounds good doesn't it? The cream puff shell which should be light and fluffy with a "slight" pull was extremely tough, flavorless, dry and I am assuming old! How can they even call it a cream puff when the best part (the cream) is non existent? So my dry ball was filled with Dreyers ice cream. Not good.   We actually ate lunch first. They have an "American" menu. Egg Salad, BLT, Burgers, Tuna, Grilled Cheese etc.... . The problem is nothing was good. I ordered a patty melt. The burger was tasteless and very, very  small. Id say about the size patty you would find on a Mcdonalds Kids Cheeseburger. The Kicker....No fries. No Fries? What the Fuck? Chips?Stick these chips in some ice cream and get creative. Daughter had a BLT, two strips, yes, two strips of bacon on wonder bread. Coleslaw was the WORST I HAVE EVER HAD! This place just sucks. Huge upset for a place I was really looking forward to. I try to review the food as much as possible but I have to say this about the service. SSLLOOWW! We had a group of 8 and our waitress could only bring out 2 drinks at a time. 4 damn trips to just get our drinks. They charge for refills too! I guess that is how they keep that nostalgic feel because restaurants have not been charging refills since the days of the flood!

It is the ever changing menu that brings me in to Elements about once a month and my confidence in Chef Beau's creations. The ever changing menu generally changes about once a month. With every change I am there!!  Although the menu changes nearly every month they're a few items that to the core stay the same but has invited new guests to hang out for the "Mouth Party". Every menu change focuses on whats in season, what's fresh locally and I'm guessing Chef's mood. The core menu items that will usually make it to the dance are Foie Gras, Escargot, Elemental Soup, Duck Breast, Filet Mignon and Seafood. Sometimes he knocks these dishes out of the park while other times they FAIL. The most recent menu 3/2011 was not particularly my favorite. The Elemental soup was basically a water based Mushroom Boullion and it was weak. The Calamari was very, very, very amateure and the Duck failed to impress. Some highlights of Beau's recent menu were the Foie, and the 5 spice pork osso buco??? The pork with the Buddah buns really hit on all points.   The reason I give this place 4 stars is because it well deserves it. The reason in which I don't give 5 is because I order around 7-8 dishes and every time most impress but there is always one or two that are complete misses and I get pissed. Foie Gras pudding....nope, Dayboat Scallops were really missing there nutty, buttery sweetness and the sear on these gigantic suckers was not present. Others however like Escargot pot pie / Escargot Wontons and the most recent Escargot spring rolls wrapped in phyllo was killer. I trust Beau with every Foie dish and any Pork dish. The Kurabata Pork Belly Fried Rice is Killer.   Make your reservation for an outside table about 40 minutes prior to sunset for what I consider to be one of the best locations to enjoy an excellent dinner with a beautifull sunset. Enjoy!!

I FUCKING LOVE PIZZA! The end.  I try things over and over, sometimes when they suck too. Same is the case here. I keep trying this pizza and eveytime I just don't like it. I don't know what it is.   Sauce = Bland  Crust = Bland and did not pass the NY fold test, full on Tip Drip!!  Truly they're better places than this in AZ. I don't want to mention them in this article but 3 or 4 come to mind.    P.S. This time when I tried the pizza I was swimming laps outside.....in the heat..... That makes me soooo hungry. Our friends ordered it and thats why I had it again. As hungry as I was I still no likey!!!

Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm an addict.... I am NEVER going to quit! My stomach is blind and loves all foods. Today, Indian! Delhi Palace is very good. I have enjoyed every dish. If you are a beginner I truly recommend a dish called Chicken Tikka Masala. It is a real starter dish and is a mainstay on almost every Indian menu. It is fragrant, creamy, rich and warming. It is not spicy. That's just a tip for newcomers. For foodies and ethnic eaters do try the Karahi Goat very hot. It is delicious. Vegetable Korma quells the heat a little. The Paneer here is some of the best I have tasted. Fresh, firm and creamy. Daler Mehndi the "Punjab Pimp" is humming beats in my head now. I must go , my food has arrived. Oh, I love when reps bring me free lunch.  Please, do not forget the Naan. I hope you enjoy.

* This 5 Star rating is for the PIZZA only!!!  This review is long overdue. As a matter of fact I started waiting in line to get into this joint last year and I just now had my order taken. No joke here, the lines are serious and the people in line seriously want there food. It is a long wait!! I will not eat a PB during the summer months. It's actually a seasonal restaurant for me unless I have hired a place holder. Expect to arrive early to get a spot in line. If you are more than 25-30 deep you are going to have to wait until second seating.....sometimes taking 2+ hours. That is the bad. I have been here morethan a dozen times and it is always worth the wait. I love pizza. I mean c'mon, really; Who does'nt?   My very first time I said "Pizza is not worth this wait", on the contrary, it most certainly is. This is not NY style, Chicago style or any other this is Chris Bianco style and it is fantastic. Hot, chewy, toasty crust with a bit of a pull. Housemade sausage, frsh grown on site vegetables and an incredibaly hot oven help create these gems. If you are a visitor from out of state DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP!  Every pie is great. The fresh fennel and sausage is out of this planet. Enjoy!!  Please don't let the wait time and snobby people bother you too much. There are some pretentious pricks who wait and feel like they own the joint because they are regulars.....ignore them. Wait...Sit...take your time and enjoy yourself!!

What; The Fuck! There is a HUUUGE rift in the taste bud department. I really don't know how to say this without completely insulting SOME reviewers but do you have any fucking taste buds? How the hell does this shitbox get 4 solid stars and over 100 reviews?????? Please, someone? This is garbage. GARBAGE. It has been awhile since I've eaten at a chain restaurant and it will be another decade before I do again it seems. Here is what I know, this is what I've eaten.  Gnocchi w/ Sausage in a Vodka Cream Sauce. I don't care if the sausage was good or if the sauce was perfect. The Gnocchi was TERRIBLE! Gummy, Dense, Thick....DEES-CUSTING.  Lobster Carbonara. Overall taste was fair, sauce had binded and really became bulky whilst mid pasta twist. Snap pea pods in the dish?? Peas...Definately. Pods.....way to sweet and distinct. Service was terrible.....Terrible. There are many Italian restaurants in Arizona. This so far has been the worst for me. The other 5 diners agree too. Dismal White Clam Sauce, Bready, Heavy meatball's, Tough Raviolis. The only standout......Grilled Poundcake....It was descent.

Oh NO! So I have passed this place nearly two dozen times and every time I look inside the place is DEAD!! I wonder to myself WTF; How does this place stay open? Now, I love Chicken. I could eat Japanese, Chinese and Hawaiin everyday if it is grilled or sauteed. Not fried. So, I get done training and I decide Im going to give this graveyard a try. I walk in, no smell! I look around, No customers. I walk up to the counter and the only thing I can hear is the air vent. Fucking Crickets I tell you. So So quiet. I knew this was going to be bad. And I'm going to cut to the end here....... It was the worst I have ever had. The chicken was not fresh, there was very little flavor and the kicker...... Diaherhea (spelling) and the chills..... ENOUGH SAID!!

Short and Sweet....  Food - Mediocre at best  Service - Poor  I just don't get the popularity of PF Changs. Whenever I buy lunch for my office and warehouse they choose Changs. I always try a different dish and am never satisfied. How much gourmet-tized Panda express items can be had at this joint? I keep trying to find an item I could put in the memory bank for the innevitable future order for the workers. So far I have not found that dish.  This is by far and wide Americanized, Sticky, Salty and Sweet Chinese food with a limited vegetable offering.  I have had the Sea Bass which was dry and refused to flake. I have had the Mushu Pork and this dish was out of the many, the better of the rest. The Duck was dry and the skin lacked that aromatic licorice roasted skin flavor. Then there is the Panda Express Staples. Orange chicken, Lemon Chicken, Sweet and Sour, Beef Mongolllian, Beef With Brocoli, Low Mein, Kung Pao etc.   It may be for you if you like that kind of food. I find it to be very overpriced for mediocre food. If it was fantastic you could not put a price on this that I would not pay. I will say, I went to the restaurant and ordered Ma Pao Tofu and it was at least better than expected.  If you like more "City" style chinese food I do suggest Nee House although their  service sucks, Prime on Camelback, Jade Palace is pretty good, Hong Kong House on Mcdowell and for a nostalgic kick in the ass with relatively good ChinaTown dishes try Dragon Palace. These places are less expensive and taste much better than Changs. Heres a pointer too, if chinese chefs are cooking your food....well, who better?

WHAT A LET DOWN! I liken this dining experience to a movie that everyone raves about, should be good and you set your expectations very high only to be let down hard. B and B was not only not good, it was overpriced too boot! I don't think there is a foodie out there that does not mind spending any amount typically as long as the entrees are well prepared. Here is the breakdown of my meal so you can compare:  ANTIPASTI:  Beet Salad: One of the better dishes. The marinate had a touch to much vinegar. The pistachio with the beats was excellent however!  Warm Lamb's Tongue: Really bad. I love lamb. Almost every part. Haji Baba in Arizona does wonderfull lambs tongue for $6.00. Haji blew away B & B on every note. The tongue was sliced so thin it was almost unrecognizable. The Chanterelles had very little flavor. A poor dish.  Grilled Octopus: While every flavor hit, it would have been nice if the octopus was cooked properly. The Octopus was dry and fibrous.  PRIMI:  Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver: I LOVE fresh pasta. It should be cooked properly. Al Dente it was not. It actually was hard, absolutely undrcooked! The Beef Cheek was lacking creaminess. The crushed duck liver was not crushed duck liver? It was pureed tpgether with an overly salty beef stock. No earthy chocolate notes from the black truffle was present.  Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Buco Ragù: The worst dish of the evening. I'm a Bone Marrow aficionado and this was DISGUSTING! What was inside the undercooked Ravioli was BONE MARROW FLAVORED OIL. The Ravioli was like a Gushers fruit snack. Hard and chewy outside with an disgusting burst of oil inside. TERRIBLE. I actually told the waitress how bad it was and I my comment was dismissed instantly. Basically our waitress turned my statement into a MY PROBLEM, not hers or the restaurants! I had every Ravioli on my plate minus two and she did not offer a replacement or to remove from our bill. The Osso Buco was not Ragu. The Osso Buco was minimal in size, with large anounts of chewy, unrendered fat.  Spaghettini with Garlic Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster: The pasta was toothesome and cooked perfectly on ONE order of this dish. The other again was undercooked. The Lobster was not sweet, although plentifull. Some was translucent and inedible. The sauce was simple, not a lot going on HOWEVER, I did really like the natural subtle flavors and freshness of this sauce.  We were all very dissapointed! Skipping dessert was a first for me but we did indeed skip. Man, what a fucking let down. Really bummed out! As far as the movie review, it sucked. It sucked worse than Glitter!!

If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.   Lemongrass is wonderfull. If you truly like Thai, not chain Thai. The lady's in the Kitchen will serve you food at it's freshest. One true testament in Thai cooking that I look for is COLOR. It is so important. All the vegetables are colorful. They are all flavorful. Now, what tastes good to me and what you like are different. So I hate to say you will love this dish.... . Believe me when I say I have never had a bad dish! Every item is TAY-STEE. Thai for yummy!!   You have the option of adding meats to your dish. They are all fine but do avoid adding beef. It is NOT GOOD. The only dish you should have beef in is the only dish on the menu designed for it. Beef Satay in Peanut sauce. TIP#1 If you love HOT food order your dish Thai Hot Plus! TIP#2 If the hot food is too much; order Thai Iced Tea to quell the burn. The Thai Iced Tea is  the best in AZ. It is super smoky and sweet.  PARKING SUCKS!!!!!!!

Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm an addict.... I am NEVER going to quit! My stomach is blind and loves all foods. Today we are talking RED DEVIL! Nuff said. A valley institution. I recently found out that this FAMILY OWNED restaurant has been in AZ for 50 years. Are you kidding?! That is incredible for a restaurant; + it is not a chain. I really am not so shocked though. This place is so consistent. Enough talk about how one pizza place taste like New York. Really, stop it! I am from Brooklyn, NY and there is NO pizza in Arizona that comes close to tasting like New York pizza does. That is not a bad thing either. I'll tell you why. There is not a pizza joint in New York that tastes anything like a Red Devil Pizza. We truly are blessed to have pizza this good and unique in Arizona. Now, it has taken 50 years to open only 5 stores. I think the Bistro is the newest location. Whatever they want to call it is fine, it is still a Red Devil. An Arizona original! I wish they would sell pizza by the slice.

I thought "Corporate Sushi" no fucking way!! I have been a fan of Blue Wasabi and RA was a go to for me. I love Sashimi and eat it about twice a month. So my friend and I decided to try Kabuki as an option to the latter. When we walked in my first impression was this place was alot more open, brighter and better decorated than RA and BW. It had no smell which is a great sign.   I went out of my usual realm of Hamachi Sashimi and Uni. I actually ordered an entree for the first time at a sushi joint. I want to tell you that what I had was a 5 star dish. I am a Sucker for chilean sea bass. It's buttery, flaky, holds flavor well and tastes absolutely deliciuos. This place did not fail to impress. I loved the freshness. It was cooked PERFECT and the sauce was out of this world. One of the best Sea Bass dishes I have ever had and I have eaten this dish all over the country! If you love Chilean Sea Bass do not pass this up. It is my guarentee you will be shocked that a corporation could create such a flavourfull dish!!

Yes it is a buffet! Ok, I get it. Yes I am a food snob, you clearly understand these two DON'T mix!  Alas, the buffet is one of my guilty pleasures. Kinda like a Hostess Apple pie with Pork rinds. Hey now. So about once a year I go to a buffett. I go with a raging appetite and leave fat and usually not so happy. My Mother and Father happened upon this place and brought me and my Daughters to try it. They said it was REALLY good. This was my first trip to a Chinese buffet with my girls. It was not the mediocre slop I usually find at the CB (Chinese Boofay) this was a place where I would pay $25 for the Mongollian Beef alone. They have some of the best spare ribs I have had this side of Chinatown in NYC....where I am from....I know my Chinese. The Pork chop is oustanding. They have a trditional Japanese Eggplant and garlic dish that is so purple and bursting with flavor It's like Mardi Gras in my mouth. They have Steamed clams, Steamed Crab Legs, Steamed Fish of the Day. One standout is the Roast Duck. Now in no way is it excellent, it is Fair to Good. HOWEVER, if you ask them to make fresh Duck, they will happily oblige you. Then, the Duck becomes a real treat. That's right, I am talking to the tribe for a moment......ask for fresh duck, you will not be dissapointed!!! There are plenty of fried foods if thats your bag, Wal-Mart chinese food I call it. Fried Sticky Sweet Chicken and Beef dishes are sure to please your Panda Palate and will afford you the opportunity to ruin your greyish looking fruit of the loom t-shirt. Heres a tip, There is a dish that has frried chicken (white meat only) with Honeya and Jalapenos. The Jalapenos in this dish are TOO DIE FOR. I add them to my mongollian beef. The fried crab is a chinese staple and is done up pretty nicely here. Very fresh tasting. They have sushi...............I love sushi........I have never eaten it here and I never will. It does look fresh, my framily says it's fine but I am reluctant to try it. The staff is very nice and very accomodating. My CB experience has gone from once a year to once a month with this place. For a boofay they are the best I have had!!!

WTF? WTF? WWWWTTTFFF?  I must be on lonely island because this place sucks. I have a theory about pizza. You could take a loaf of wonder bread, a jar of ragu and melt mozzarella cheese on top and usually find yourself pretty pleased. Pizza is just, well....comforting. Cold/Hot you generally can't go wrong.  NYPD is TERRIBLE! Pizza does not have to be New York style to be good these days. Although being from Brooklyn the Pizza in New York can't be beat. It is my favorite. I wish they would take the NY out of there name because this place is PURE AND UTTER GARBAGE!!!

FIRST OFF GWEN, YOUR A NAZI....!! Gwen is a spin instructor who challenges you at all points. She really is great, I hate you!   Anyone who says that Lifetime Fitness is not worth the fee does not belong to Lifetime. Anyone who says Lifetime is not the best club ever....does not belong to Lifetime. Anyone who says it's a rip-off CAN"T AFFORD LIFETIME. I love the classes, the clientel the trainers. They are all a part of what makes a great health club. The other defacto here is the club is bar none nicer than any other in our state. This is not a pretentious club, this is a club where people come to have a great workout and HELP others to do the same. I really don't want to make a page about Lifetime so please visit this club, look online or ask others who are members. CHAUNCEY only BTW!! I am only speaking of Chauncey.  For those who have a proffesional carreer not only do they offer you classes at 5:30 A.M. but they leave you alone. You are not bombarded with people around you. If you prefer a workout on your own based on your schedule well this joint is rocking 24/7. Can't beat it!!

If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.  Fifth time there, time to review. I'ts a simple format. Eat Meat! The dinig room at night is like a dance floor of waiters holding there meatsticks and offering it up to our hungry mouths. Ok, that looks like a porn intro.... but it's true. So for now call me Brandon St. Randy cause I want the meat they got. First off skip the salad bar please. This is a place to get your protein, nothing else. The slad bar has all kinds of frou frou hearts of palm, and aged romano. Sissy shit. Here at Fogo it's meat only. The house specialty here is the "picahna" and it is so good. It's like the best part of bacon fat on top of juicy sirloin. Make sure you get good slices wth a good amount of fat cap. Skip the chicken legs.....boring. All other cuts of meat are delicious. Do not pass on the Brazilian Limeonade!!! DO NOT! It is bottomless and so damn tasty, just needs a good rum in it.   Inexpensive for what you get. Make sure to turn your service card to OFF or there will be a dancing meat stick waiter on one of your elbow's.  They offer excellent sides. Caramlized Bananas, Grilled Polenta and you can ask your waiter for spicy dipping sauce, it is not on the menu or offered you need to ask. The varietes of meat include Top and Bottom Sirloin, Tenderloin, Pork and Beef Ribs, Chicken Drums, Lamb Chops and Chicken wrapped in Bacon. For me, it's only the Red's....Meat that is!

If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.  I LOVE fried chicken! Always on the hunt for the tender fried feathered...unfeathered friend. I have chowed here 4 times expecting it to be orgasmic, wanting to love it. Well, I don't. I have finally decided to post why. I am not from the school of "one and done" everybody, well almost everybody when it comes to food get's a second chance. Sometimes even more. I am done with Lo-Lo's however. Here is the phat skinny. I order the KK's. It is 3 pieces of chicken with two waffles, grits and cheesy onion eggs. I have a big ASS Kool-Aid, (wish they had the purple stuff) and I eat the whole damn meal. The waffles are ok for me, they are not as crisp on the outside as I would like and they are soooo thin. The cheese and onion eggs are great. But c'mon, the fried chicken at a fried chicken joint needs to be OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! With all fellow yelpers basically saying that it is I feel like I'm going to be sent off Yelp Island. Fortunately my little sis is a part of Yelp so I may get a free pass...ala second chance! The Fried Chicken here tastes like someone broke out some progresso bread crumbs and a big ass bottle of wesson cooking oil and cooked about 100 batches in the same dirty oil. It just had the burnt dirty oil flavor every time. I am not a fan of that. The Thighs were pretty descent, the breast was horrible. Every time the breast meat is dry, bland and has that off putting oil taste.   So, LO-LO....NO-NO, get some Purple Drink-Mix and keep that damn bird moist. Change the oil more often and I will try again. Untill then I will keep creating my own "Ghetto Taco" Thats what we call them in New York. A box of Churches a bottle of hot sauce and a box of frozen waffles..... with some Cream of Wheat on the side!!

I AM AWARDING 5 STARS FOR:  BUTTERMILK PIE W/ HOMEMADE RICH, BUTTERY, SMOKY CARAMEL SAUCE.  Made from scratch. It is simple, fresh and pure. This is a true testament to baking something in simplest form and creating a masterpiece!!  For 4 years I have been eating this pie on my Birthday. It's a once a year treat and I love it.

My Wife introduced me to Cathy's Rum Cake about 18 years ago. It was the first time I had ever heard of it. I LOVED the incredible creation! Every year since I ordered her a Rum Cake from Cathy. This year, around March I was left with the option to buy a Rum cake from Lisa. I figured....it's a family business so the recipe would be similiar if not exact. Now, they may be, but something is definately missing and that is, well......EVERYTHING!   The cake I ordered was so bad! We literally each took two bites. The first was awfull. The second was to make sure the first bite was not a Fluke. It most def. was not a fluke. The filling was sour/bitter. Not spoiled though. The cake was gummy and dense. The frosting tasted like cool whip. Nothing close to what I first tasted 18 years ago and enjoyed almost every year since. Plane and simple...the cake sucked so bad that I am going to leave you with a quote from a current pop song! "We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"!

You can't see it because Im writing....... But this Smile.....Ear to Fucking Ear!!! Im going to start with Dessert, because Im still smiling!!  I literally was moaning and laughing at how good this shit was. Salted Caramel with house made caramel popcorn. WTF indeed. So good. And I Skeet in my G-Star Briefs.  Pastrami Turkey Sand on a Pretzel Roll. Sounded Basic, tasted great! It ranks at my #2 sandwich of all time right behind the Muffelatta from central grocery store in the Dump that is New Orleans. A pile of warm and tender Turkey Pastrami, better than beef Pastrami, with cheese and coleslaw. Its piled high on a Buttery, Savory, Hot, Warm and slightly chewy Pretzel roll.    Everything else I had was forgettable..... Roasted Beats were WEAK! 36 hour ribs were fair and the Cubano Sandwich was below expectations.  So, we have this line cook or chef, can't quite figure it out, with passion. He has spikes sticking out of his scalp and extending 18" 's out like a weapon. A guy who looks like he should be doing my Tattoo the next time I knock someone out in the ring (Boxing) not gay ass MMA. Sorry! A Brunette waitress who is thick, not fat,  and pretty damn good looking seemed to float across the floor and was kinda exotic looking. There were some other waitresses there that were easy on the pupils too. A blonde with major hip swing. Tom, my waiter....pretty cool, kinda funny. I like him because hge suggested the Mouth-Gasm dessert. I thought he said it came in a shot glass, it came in a rocks glass, I bitched for a second, and ate almost the whole thing. Tjhis smart ass Tom says " Well, you did not have trouble finishing it" that was funny as shit. I said " I did not say I couldnt, I did not want to"   Good Place. Go.

NOPE! HUH UH! DOO-DOO! Ok. This is pretty harsh. I was there for the first time on 9/2/2010 before the last of the Cardinals pre-season opener for a bite before the game. There was a wait....ok....got it! However, their were open tables? Don't GOT it! The hostess said "Your table is ready" yay! "Oh, by the way would you mind sitting on the patio"? We were game for it. The Hostess then walks us through the patio and out to.....wait for it......Arizona beach area?! Low back, low to the ground wooden benches and beach style chairs. Yeah, sure in Arizona 100 plus heat. Not happening. So, we wait for an inside table. We eventually get one. The friendly waitress Jesse takes our drink order. We wait about 4 minutes or so.....perfect. Jesse takes our food order. We wait about 50 minutes for not so good food. I was with 2 other people. We ordered the following. Person #1 ordered Nacho's w/ sour cream on the side. Person #2 ordered a grilled chicken Quesadilla and I ordered fried Ice Cream. They were all terrible. The Quesadilla was as thin as Taco Bell's and three times the price. I mean they were SKIMPY! The Nacho's I was told were chewy. Nice, just what one would like, chewy nacho's. Jesse our server did apologize for the wait saying this " Im so sorry you had to wait. I keep telling the staff to hold off on seating people to give the kitchen a chance to get caught up" WELL, that explains why we could not be sat inside when there were tables open. So, like I said. Pretty bad execution, bad food, long wait. NO GOOD! If you go keep in mind too the menu is extremely limited. So, ADIOS....thats goodbye in.....well I'm just sticking with the theme, using my resources!

Well if it smells like shit?... Looks like shit....?  First off this "Aquarium" or as I have newly named it "The Fishtank" is in the most GHETTO mall I have ever been too. I had heard about this mall and it lived up to every expectation and then some. Gross, I must have sanitized my hands 100 times. I was actually shocked I was not greeted by an acordian playing child selling chiclets gum.  Of course, this is not about the mall, this is about the aquarium. Heres your run down YELP:  Small  Smelly  Crowded  Unimpressive  Underwhelming  RIP OFF!!  30 minutes to get through  I was looking forward to seeing sharks in AZ. The ONE shark they had in the main glass walkthrough I could defeat with my left hand and my right eye closed. It was tiny.    If your 5 year old just got done watching finding Nemo HE/SHE may be impressed....all others stay away. This place is terrible and the atmosphere is gross!

Terrible!!!!!!!!!  I was on the hunt for a Heavy duty Commercial grade carpet for my office. The first slaesman that came out was Bob Blankenship. He was awfull. He measured and gave me a quote. When I asked how much it was he gave me a price. I then asked for him to leave a quote and he refused! He said " GIVE ME MY BUSINESS CARD AND I'LL WRITE THE PRICE ON THE BACK FOR YOU" so I let him. I told him I would like a breakdown of Carpet price and Installation. He refused! I asked him for the brand of carpet......HE REFUSED saying " All our carpet is made specifically for us under our name" I called customer service and spoke with a man, I explained what was going on and that Empires prices were extremely high. The man on the phone took almost $1500.00 off the price and said he would have a new rep come see me. I got a call from Mike Miran with Empire and he said there was no need to come back out. The price the Man had given me on the phone was for the lowest grade of carpet they have to keep me interested. That same man from customer service called me back to ask if a new rep had been out and I told him no. He said they would absolutely have another rep come by.   A lady Christina Vasseur came by my office and she was polite but very sales like. I explained to her in no uncertain terms what we were looking for in a carpet and a quote. It took a week for her quote to get to me and it was not what I asked for. AGAIN it was just a price, no breakdown of install price, Carpet style or price per yard!!! I told her I could not comparison shop or know if I'm getting a good deal without the breakdown. She told me that they quote all inclusive as a job complete. I felt like there was no disclosure on pricing and that is one reason why I did not use them. The other reason I did not use them is because they were the highest price amongst the four quotes I received. I gave her a second look and explained she was very high priced. She told me they were the best and you get what you pay for. Well, between my 3 reps for Empire they were all awfull. So bad customer service and high prices = no business from me!!   One more thing.....the cell number listed on Christina Vasseur's business card is for her personal photography business!!! Stay classy Empire!

On Saturday I crushed the competition during the "Great Urban Race". I was in a race to Sunday because I knew my Wife and I were going to CPH on Sunday for dinner!   So we get there Sunday with Reservation. I order a Midwest Manhattan, it sucked and the B-tender noticed I did not like it. He asked me for a baseline of what I liked and made a drink for me based on that. Guess Im a fruit because he gave me something pearish with red bull! It was good. My wife got sangria which was killer. We were with other guests and wanted to try the menu, so here goes:  Appetizers:  Kiltlifter Fondue: 2.5/5 - Not a thick fondue....and thats ok because the flavour is sharp, which I like. What I did not like was I could not taste the subtle flavors of the hops and barley.  Bernies Mac n' Cheese: 2.5/5 - Pretty boring. Cavatelli, came to the party underdressed and overpaid. Same mix of ingredients in the fondue. Laughing at myself.  Pork Belly Pastrami : 4/5  - This could easily be a five. It just needed a stronger pepper crust to contrast the flavourful fattyness. This dish is excellent. I actually can't wait to go back and eat it again. The flavor of pastrami, yet not as smoky as you would find in a NYC deli, as fatty and tender as can be, Oh and the tatses linger....into bedtime!! Not so good...Pastami burps. The rye spaetzle was great and I loved the sprout krout!!! Whole mustard seeds a nice touch!!   Chicken and Waffles : 3.75/5 - Really surprised! Loved the waffle. It was a touch small. Crunchy outside, soft middle full of flavour. The blue clover honey is not as fancy as some might think, quite common actually, none the less it is good. CPH may want to sub for a single pass amber. The almond butter was a nice touch. What I liked was the light crust on the chicken, and the chicken was moist, literally juicy.  Meatloaf 2/5 - Terrible. Dry with an over salty demi. Ho hum pot's and weak zuzchini. My wifes is better but I wont tell her! Sorry. The two star rating is becuse the portion size is enormous....which, had the meatloaf been good would have busted my gut. But there are some round eaters out there that would like to know that this brick o meat is for you.   Lamb Burger 4/5 - Really good. Cooked perfectly, charred a bit on outside with a nice juicy oink center. The Carrier for the beast was crispy, Warm, chewy and soft. Delicious!! Loved the fact that it was like a gyro sans gyro meat. Replaced with a hunk of charred lamb. Good Shit. The fries were great but the ketchup....thats a bingo bitch, what fun!  Duck Smoked 3.5/5 - Cooked perfectly!! Thats always a bonus. Thank you chef! Everthying seemed right here, just did not do it FOR ME! I have had much better but this was good. Definately got the flavour profile balanced. Loved the Kale! Eh...maybe I should bump this to a 4 star dish.  Pretty good.  Scallop and Grits 5/5 - Excellent ! I thought I was the only one who could truly execute a perfect tasting scallop. It is my pickest dish and one of the easiest to ruin. They were seared perfectly, cooked just right and all the oceanic, nutty, buttery smooth richness you want from a scallop was present upon first bite. The grits.....hands down the best part of my dinner. Thet were rich, roasty, corny and had absorbed the brine from the scallops almost turning this dish into a grit ala risotto. Weird, delis=cious with a a tongue ascerbic lashing from colas gastrique. Nicely done. I will be back for this soon!!  Overall a great place. Big on flavor, good vibe and it's nice to see the workers hanging out and helping out as if you were invited to a buddys house. They want you to be happy!! Good Shit!

Just wanted to send cheers to G-Star Scottsdale for continuing to be RAW; And by RAW I mean awesome! The heads up phone calls, a prerequisite to better fashion, continue to come. Keep it up. They will search for articles through the distributor if the item is not available in store and they are helpful in the store too. Been loving the line for some time, does not look like something to go from fad to bad. PLEASE GET YOUR CLOTHES AWAY FROM BUCKLE! I dont need to see an Obey, RVCA or Affliction shirt next to G-Star. Thanks.  Only downfall is G-Star on lexington in NYC spoiled me too much. The Scottsdale store is about 1/2 the size.

I just purchased an LC9. This was handgun of the year 2011 and Is somwhere between an LCP and SR9. Nice compromising middle. I had called and spoke with Mike. He had the gun I wanted and was about $194.00 less expensive than if I would have gone with my normal Gun Broker. It has been over 8 years and this was my first purchase anywhere else. I know with the pricing it will not be my last. John introduced himself after the sale was complete. A nice guy who knows a wee bit about firearms. Asked him about Tavor....he knew right away what it was. I liek this place and 5 stars is appropriate.

You can tell 100% that we are reviewing food right? At the expense of being very cliche " There is enough WINE here"   I keep reading post after terrible post with negative reviews. It was not nearly that bad! Here, I'll break it down.  Lets talk about food:  Devilicious : I must say the All Crab Crab Cake is forever in my top ten foods EVER! The butter poached lobster grilled cheese with carmalized onions was good, not WOW!   Bee: Some relative of the Lo Lo's family trying her hand at International Foods. Meh! Indian Coconut Curry Chicken. Perch and chips....Catfish Slider...All MEH!!  Street Market : KILLER Korean Short Rib in Steamed Chinese Bun....  Pizza People: Fair, nothing special. Go to Red Devil!  Montana BBQ: HUGE ASS LINE.....GOOD ASS PULLED PORK!  Shut Your Pie Hole: Cant remember the name of the little red truck serving up this incredibly terrible pie in a cup for $4.00 each. Terrible! Had Coconut Cream pie. I swear it was coconut pudding on a saltine cracker in a cup, about two tablespoons worth.   Duck Duck Pig: MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT!! Where was all your good stuff? You have incredible ducky dishes and you come to a festival and serve up one shitty pork slider. GFYS!!!! I waited in line for nothing! Yep, still mad about that.   T-Licious: D-Licious. Try them all. Before the two hour line formed!  Epic Hot Dog: When has anyone,Man or Women wished for half a Weiner?Change your game! Frenchie dog is good shit Mang!  Lobster on A Roll: Ive had better. Much Better. Boton...NYC....  Long Lines...Yuuuup! They opened at 10 AM.... My Family and I were there at 10Am and about 1000 other people. We ate and Left before the huge lines and food run out.  Suggestion next year. Simple, Learn from your mistakes this year. It was your inaugural event. For a first time out.....Not Bad. Yelpers, Cut the festival some fucking slack, and stop crying about 5 bux to park. And you....Lady.... just because the guy working in the parking loty makes min wage does not mean you should beat the kid up about it.

Yuh did shut my pie hole; My fingers can still talk though. So...over to you fingers. I tried this Food Truck at the "Great Food Truck Festival". I would give this place about 1.5 stars if I could. I love pie....Fuckin' love it....not this though. They had a variety of cream base pies. We tried most, all were not good at all. There was a cream base and I swear to me that canned topping was used. The prices were high and the product was low. Even if your not an econ expert one should know not to buy.   On a happier note my Pie Hole has once again opened after fear of something nasty again returning to my mouth.

Terrible.   This spot was going to be the kind of spot I could get quick dinner on a hectic weeknight with my Family. Not So! The Calamari was extremely tough and did not taste fresh. The pizza was just bad. It did not have layers of texture or taste in any way. Just black bottomed and crisp. Not burnt, but a strong sour burnt taste. The center was underdone and very soggy. Just a bad meal. This was my first time eating in, second time actually eating the Pizza. Both pizza's were a TERRIBLE let down.

It's the first 110 degree day here in Arizona and my AC shits the bed. Im watching the thermostat in my house quickly rise from 78 to 96. I need an AC guy quick. It was late in the day around 5:30pm and I call Above Par. I told him I have no air, he says " No problem, Im finishing a job and Ill be right over." He shows up like he said he would. Its dark and he and his partner work without missing a beat. It's about 8:30pm and he is through...with my job at least. He tells me he is on his way to Fountain Hills then to Chandler! Good spirits and attitude the whole time.   I have a 12 year old system that I know needs to be replaced and will fail completely one day. I kniow this but Im squeezing all the air out of this rock until it wont give anymore and right now it's running ice cold and blowing hard!   Well, the next morning the bracket broke and we lost our AC again. I called Above Par to let him know. He came out, again accomodating the time I was available and fixed the problem....no charge. I want to add that this was a seperate incident too.  The guy that owns the company is Austin and he is knowledgeable and efficient. I hope his company serves as a model for other HVAC guys. High integrity, reasonable pricing and knows the business they're in. I will be replacing my unit the same day it croaks and I will be using Above Par when the time comes.

I recently found out that this FAMILY OWNED restaurant has been in AZ for 50 years. Are you kidding?! That is incredible for a restaurant; + it is not a chain. I really am not so shocked though. This place is so consistent. Enough talk about how one pizza place taste like New York. Really, stop it! I am from Brooklyn, NY and there is NO pizza in Arizona that comes close to tasting like New York pizza does. That is not a bad thing either. I'll tell you why. There is not a pizza joint in New York that tastes anything like a Red Devil Pizza. We truly are blessed to have pizza this good and unique in Arizona. Now, it has taken 50 years to open only 5 stores. I think the Bistro is the newest location. Whatever they want to call it is fine, it is still a Red Devil.

Get the Fuck on! I'm not a breast guy, I like thighs and legs and WC&D just moved my mouth up North. NEVER, have I had a better breast. I don't care what country or state I've had it, this was my favorite. Just bested Willie Mae's. The dredging is bland. Maybe a little salt and pepper but not much more. It's the sauce. The  fish sauce with mint that smells like a homeless crakheads inner toes. Belly button perhaps? I don't know and I don't care. That sauce hits your tongue on every known and unknown flavour and bud. The ones you know and the ones you never knew. Whoa. This Funky, Stinky, Pungent sauce is all you need on the crispest, juiciest fried chicken I have ever had. .... and Donuts, well....have you ever really had a bad experience with a donut? I mean, even terrible donut's are edible. So, the Bacon maple ring was actually really good. The apple fritter sucked.

Open your mouth and let me shove this killer breakfast joint's food in your face! Ya...that good. The date was Mothers day and it was packed! My Wife made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we had to wait. We waited 30+ minutes. Big fucking deal. Put your snappy chat, instagram and twitter down and spend some time....you know, talking and hugging it out with your Family. The Restaurant brought out Mimosa's to the hungry and thirsty. I thought they handled themselves well considering the mob and the special day! All that aside, yelp is not about your rude waitress, the slow cook time. We want to know about the food. Every Chef, cook, hostess and waiter/waitress is bound to have a bad day. Please stop bitching about that stuff. Get down to the food. We had a large group and here is a list of everything I actually tasted.  Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - Awesome. Buttery, Lemony, Crisp and Soft edges with moist middle. Almost my favorite ever. Served with a delicious Lemon ricotta topping.  Canolli Donut - Excellent. I would expect canolli creme to be fantastic coming from a Tomasso.   Carne Asada Hash Skillet - Perfectly marinated flat iron with two perfectly poached eggs. Very flavorful on a bed of hash brown cubes potatoes, they could have been crispier and green chilis.  Oreo Pancakes - Delicious in their own right, did not taste much like an OREO. That being said, they were still cream worthy. ya, know...OREO cream worthy.  Carrot Cake Pancakes - Damn good. Like if Upper crust bakery from the long ago Timothy's decided to make pancakes. The crispy fried carrots on top was spot on, different and texturally tasty.  Lamb Hash - Bomb. Period. If you love lamb don't miss this. Juicy seasoned lamb with poached eggs and browns. Good Shit!!  Smoked salmon Benedict. Really, should I go on. Excellent!!  Lastly.... Fruity Pebble Yogurt Breakfast Popcicles. Holy Shit Fred. What a fun and tasty way to start a breakfast. Not filling and full of flavor. I never thought it would work but those pops blew me away. Like a palleta pop thats creamy, a bit tangy from the yogurt and sweet and crispy. Yah, it's good.  That's it. I did not taste one thing that was meh. All food exceeded my expectations. The owner was out and he was very accomodating considering how busy he was. He was funny, relaxed and a small part of why my Family will be back. Can't wait. Fortunate they are right down the road from my house. My waiter. who my Wife said was a manager...I don't know how...was really good. He actually came back and thanked me for my tip. I think he was stunned, I was hoping that if I made him happy, since he made me and my Family happy, that mood would transcend to other diners waiting in the mad house.   Cheers

I would like to invite everyone to my house at this time and join me as I recreate the whitest, most pedestrian Mexican food I have ever had in the valley. I hate being so harsh, but this place sucked. This place sucked more than having to turn down girl scouts selling cookies because I'd already purchased them. This place sucked more than a Burger King Hot dog. Let's begin with where it all starts. The door. The decor did not match. It's a RuPaul drag race situation, a bit confused and the carpet not matching the drapes kinda situation. The Chips, well I don't know how but they were dry,....does that make sense. I think I prefer a greasier chip. These were like crispy oven baked in texture, though they were fried?! The Salsa, two kinds. Watery and pasty. The watery one was the standard, this was bland and tasted semi metallic, like it was canned tomato, cheap canned tomato...not Tutti Rossa. The second was also standard, a pasty, thick very bland with a spice no heavier than Taco Bells Hot sauce. Gringo town, here we go. Yes, ok then. I know that Chips and Salsa are free, well, generally. I could not eat them if i did not like them...very true! BUT, salsa kinda sets the stage because I'll be using it for the rest of the night and I don't want it to suck. Here's the Gwylo run down. Tacos, Cheese Crisp, Pollo Fundido, Bean Burrito fried and enchilada style, Chili Relleno. Honestly, they were all terrible. The Beans are really bad, not that the food was cooked wrong or was not fresh, because it was...I just did not like their recipes. The beans were an off putting, loose (Weird) brown. The Crisp was very, very oily and not very crispy. Yada, yada. One of the worst though, and I shit you not, was the Enchilada sauce. The Red Enchilada sauce. I think..um, this is the M & P brand from food city. It's chalky and dry, very salty with an earthy, dirt kinda taste followed up with a tinge of steel. It taste like it, Im pretty sure it's M & P...I know this because I used the M & P brand on a Pork Shoulder in a pinch for unexpected guests and I used it. It sucked when I made it too.   I't would and would not surprise me if this place makes it. It's in a high rent area and they need to contimually pack people in to keep it operating. The good news is Mexican food is very popular, most people have bland buds and it's sophisticated looking enough that may make certain crowds crown the place acceptable. The bad news, food just sucks and AZ has some of the best Mexican food in the country. My server was very good, the place was very clean. FLLLUUURRRRP! Bummer. I kid you not, and I know this is soup-uh cliche...but Taco Bell food has more flavor. FLAVOR...not quality. Don't get it confused Yelp Nazis.
