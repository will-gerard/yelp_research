MacAlpines, where do I start?  From what I can tell from my days of watching Happy Days, it's just like a 1950's diner.  Their sundaes are absolutely D-lish.  They also sell vintage kitsch like furniture, jewelry, hats.

This is my go-to Starbucks, mostly because it's on my way to work. Everyone there is friendly, polite and seems to know what they're doing. Even when the line is out the door these ladies (and the occasional gentleman) do a top-notch job of taking orders quickly. My name gets misspelled occasionally, but it's a tougher name to spell.   My only real complaint is please please keep the delivery counter area wiped up and dry as much as possible. Half the time I order a croissant/pastry it gets placed in drink spillage which soaks through the paper, making the croissant soggy and harder to transport in the car, (and also, not worth the price.) I understand it gets busy, but for the prices charged and the otherwise high standards, this small improvement would make a HUGE difference.

I had the best customer service ever tonight at The Limited. I went to this location because the one nearest to my home was out of the item I wanted to exchange.   Both girls working we're great -- Andee was a complete angel. She was extra attentive, sweet and extremely professional. She helped my mom and I as we enjoyed copious amounts of retail therapy.   She was also flexible about performing an exchange on a pair of pants I had a difficult time with. I wish the sales managers everywhere were as courteous, poised and thoughtful as she is -- it was really such an amazing shopping experience and it made me love The Limited even more than I already did, (which I previously did not think was possible!)  The Limited should definitely give Andee a raise and ask her to be a Corporate Ambassador helping other stores like the one at Scottsdale Fashion Square in bumping their customer service and satisfaction up to the same standard. She is absolutely wonderful. We had so much fun shopping with her! Don't let this one get away.

UPDATE: Please, please reverse the changes to your burger seasoning and french fries. The shoe string fries were your signature potato, the new fries just aren't as satisfying, (neither is the new portion). The cheeseburger is really over-salted now. Please and thank you!! P.S. I DO love what you've done with the Caesar salad; not all changes are bad!  I love Houston's. Real love too, not puppy love. We've know each other for years and still nothing is more irresistible than the crunch of their fresh Caesar salad with homemade croutons and dressing over Chet Baker's voice and some soft, mood lighting. This is more than a restaurant, it's an experience. I am always happy when I'm at Houston's; partially because I like to pretend I'm rich like 80% of their diners when I'm there. Every once in a while I get a delicious martini with olives stuffed generously with goat cheese. Also their cheese burger is hands down the best burger anywhere.  ANYWHERE.

Worst customer service experience ever. My boyfriend bought a pair of rimless frames and was upsold on super pricey "high index" lenses that were supposed to be thinner than normal ones. (They were virtually the same.)  They came in (after the first three pairs from the lab failed quality inspection) and we had to wait for an hour while they put in the extra set of lenses because the initial set had a bubble. The second set they put in seemed ok till we were home and he noticed that there is a small watermark on the lenses visible in each eye's field of view AND the lenses weren't even cut to fit the frame correctly. These are $600 glasses by the way, just sayin'.   We spoke with a very unapologetic and defensive manager/supervisor, Angel who was shaking because she was so angry (that she had to offer customer service to someone with legitimate concerns??) said the markings are standard and they couldn't do a perfect cut with the frame he selected.  I was very thrown off by her behavior since the customer in this situation was being really calm and friendly about the whole situation. I've verified since then that these markings and off-cut are not standard at most quality retailers and I have a hard time believing it is for a trusted name brand like LensCrafters.  He reordered the glasses with regular polycarbonate lenses so that he wouldn't have to deal with indicator markings. They told him it would take up to two business weeks to fill the order. After two weeks passed he called, Angel said she would call him back and never did. This happened twice and because he wasn't getting any return calls, he finally decided just to go in to the store. When he did they did in fact already have the glasses and he waited for her to prepare them -- not sure how long they were sitting in the store.  It ending up taking over a full month to get these glasses. In the meantime, the immature manager and the sales rep, Marina that we worked with offered no apologies at all.  Apparently, once you've paid they don't want to deal with your issues. I found the experience really disappointing because I've always had extremely positive dealings with LensCrafters in the past, but we won't go to this  location again in the future.

I have been coming to Parkway Medical for the last seven years and have never had a bad experience. I usually go to Dr. Saunders or Dr. O'Connor -- everyone at this office is great. The waiting area is clean and spacious, the front desk associates are friendly and professional and you can usually get in same-day if your case is urgent. Also, I love that they're open on Saturdays, providing a better alternative to a CVS Minute Clinic or an Urgent Care.

I love Arrivederci. I feel conflicted every time I'm in this shopping outlet because it's packed with two great Italian restaurants, but Arrivederci has hands-down the best eggplant you can eat in Arizona. (I've been to a lot of Italian joints.)  The service is always great, the food is always hot and delicious and the deserts are worth the guilt that come with them. Definitely check this spot out! Naomi Garnice gives it five stars.

I just plain love Guido's. There's something almost magical about the glow of Christmas lights in the window, the arrangement of black and white memorabilia photos on the walls and the deli/market layout. My other half is from Chicago and last night he was in food heaven. He had the gnocchi and I had the mostaccioli -- yum and yum!

Havana is heaven. It's absolutely amazing; I love it there and you will too. The cafe is filled with green plants and furniture and snazzy decor, that's right, snazzy. But of course, the food and adult beverages are the best part.  I usually order a few appetizers there; my absolute fave is the black bean fritters that come with an avocado dip. Holy yum! It's unbelievable. I also recommend the pastelitos (puff pastry) filled with spinach and cheesy goodness. The black bean soup is de-lish and has a little kick to it.  You have to cool all the zest and spices down with a sweet, banana daiquiri... when in Cuba, right? Naomi Garnice gives this place two thumbs up, love it!  I went to Havana again this month for a Mojito Class -- it was so much fun! We learned how to make strawberry, watermelon and classic mojitos complete with our own individual muddlers. Be sure to join the mailing list when you go in to get notified of upcoming events!

Holy yum, I could eat here every day. Randomly went here last week for the first time and it was love-at-first-bite. This restaurant is authentic family-style, there are photos of the family on the walls and under the glass table tops. The service was amazing; our server was one of the sons and he never stopped smiling.  We tried the stuffed shells, the eggplant parmigiana and the Caesar salad. It was all delicious. The Caesar dressing had a hint of olive oil, the eggplant parmigiana was thick and tender and the stuffed shells are now absolutely my favorite thing ever.  There's no bar, BUT you can bring your own bottle of wine and they will serve you without a corking fee.   Note for the owners: Your joint is amazing. I love the traditional, down-to-earth feel but it could really benefit from the convenience of a credit card machine. I wanted to take my boyfriend here this weekend but we didn't have cash on us. Please, please start taking credit/debit cards.

This is hands-down my favorite sushi joint in town. The fish is always amazingly fresh, the owners and staff are always friendly and the soft lull of music and clean, minimal surroundings are perfect. My favorite rolls are the negitori crunchy roll and the spicy salmon, however; everything is very tasty. If you love sushi, you'll love Hiro. Naomi Garnice gives it two-thumbs-up!!

Recently started dropping in at Goldie's once or twice a week. It's Cheers, but in Scottsdale, which is great. They have drink specials every night and the bartenders there are always extra attentive -- I really like Ellie, she's fantastic.   Haven't eaten much there yet, but all the food I've had so far has been great. The root beer float is delish, I'm looking forward to trying their shrimp -- you get half a pound for $9.  If you live in Scottsdale, but don't want a cozy place that isn't overly formal or extra pricey, this is it!

I've been taking my pets here for years and have the utmost faith in the staff. They always do a very thorough examination and you can tell they genuinely care about their patients. All of the doctors are great, but Dr. Burke is my standby. He is extremely smart and compassionate and referred me to dog's oncologist, Dr. Hillers, when she was diagnosed with Cancer. I highly recommend him and this clinic; they are the best.

Oh Oreganos, it's been over ten years since I fell in love with your fresh, flavorful salads and your cleverly quipped "Zany Ziti". Still, somehow I think I love you more every year, which is why I'm willing to wait on a week night, or any night for that matter. All of my friends know that if they suggest dinner of my choice then we will be heading over to Scottsdale and Shea because it doesn't get any better than that.  This is BY FAR the best Oregano's location. (I have been to all of them minus Flagstaff and PV Mall area.) The cheerleaders also known as servers there are always friendly, smiling and fast. I only have two suggestions for this location and others:  1) Salads and main courses should never arrive together unless specified by the guest. Sometimes I forget to tell my server I want my salad first and my food gets cold. Mutl-tasking isn't something that should be involved when dining, we want to savor the moment and the delicious food. Let's fix this!  2) The Gorgonzola vinaigrette was the best thing that happened to Oregano's since the old-school raspberry vinaigrette took off. Please bring one of these dressings back stat.

UPDATE: Drumroll.... I am back on the Oregano's bandwagon!! I had a not-so-hot experience a couple months ago that I included in a review update on Yelp. After posting my review, their PR representative promptly reached out to me, apologized and asked us to give Oregano's another shot. She asked for my contact info to send a gift card -- what great, Yelpy etiquette! And when we came back in it was great to be back. The service and food were amazing and I remembered why I became such a huge Oregano's addict in the first place, (mouthwatering food and fun atmosphere).  You know what they say about customers who have an issue: if you show you care and try to make it right they'll be your most satisfied, loyal customers ever in the future. Having said that, Oregano's and I are officially back together. And to quote Peaches and Herb (yup, that's a real band name), we're "reunited and it feels so good," but mostly, tastes SO good. Thanks, Oregano's!!

Holy delicious! Los Olivos is the best Mexican restaurant I've had; which is saying something because I live in Arizona. I absolutely love their tacos and enchiladas. They have great lunch specials during the week; this is my favorite lunch spot.   Request to the owners: Bring back the complimentary bean dip, please!

I love this place. They have a broad selection of regular and gel polishes. Also, the nail technicians really listen to what you're asking for length and shape-wise. A few things to keep in mind, they accept cash tips only so be sure to grab a couple fives before you head over. Also, they're usually packed on the weekend so call ahead and schedule an appointment -- they sometimes book completely! Naomi Garnice gives this place five stars.

'Yay! I'm a fan' is right. This is one of my favorite Starbucks -- I missed it this weekend during their renovations. The service is great, the drinks are accurate and everyone generally seems pretty happy to be there.   Only complaint: Please carry more of the chocolate croissants. Thank you.

Yikes, talk about angry reviews. I've usually had a great experience at this location. The greeters are always friendly and seemingly want to be there. The service is relatively fast and the food is zesty and delicious. We usually order the 2-for-20 and enjoy guacamole dip and salsa before our entrees. It's a great deal. The servers are always friendly and there's never a wait. Really no complaints on my end!

My car has been making an unhappy noise for a couple months.  I took it into *an unnamed* auto shop in October and they couldn't find the issue.  Finally I took it into Sun Devil Auto and they had all the details for me in two hours.  My air compressor kit needed to be replaced, or my belt was going to break.   I called around and did price comparisons on the repairs I needed -- they gave me a good price.  Plus, I added on an oil change for only $15.    These guys are fan-freaking-tastic.  Without their serious know-how, and their tough love, my car and I would be immobile.  If you love your car and good, honest people then bring it here next time you need a repair.

Halo is amazing.  I've been a customer since I was 18, (that's 10 years).  I've had all my piercings done there.  They carry a full selection of unique, high quality jewelry that makes you feel like you're eight years old at a candy store.  Their piercing rooms are probably cleaner than your doctor's office and because Glen and Kelsey only hire good, clean professionals, you are always in good hands.

This is by far one of the best breakfast joints in Scottsdale. They've remodeled and expanded so the space is huge and there's less wait even on a Saturday or Sunday. They have a delish assortment of breakfast, brunchy and lunchy items. I love their french toast with challah bread. They also make an incredible grilled cheese. Only complaint: the tomato soup leaves something to be desired, it's over-peppered and hard to eat.  The service is always great and the staff is extremely peppy and professional. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars!

I was at SMIL this week for a biopsy; I've also gone there for an ultrasound and mammogram. The staff is excellent, the nurses are exceptionally sweet and the doctors have an amazing bedside manner. They sent me my results very quickly too... I found out there's no Cancer the following day! Really great experience despite the uncomfortable nature of the procedure.

It's important to support local business, but that's not why I'm writing this.  I'm writing this because the creamsicle 1/4 sheet cake from AJ's had my mom, my grandma and the people at their combined-birthday singing my praises and acting generally wowed about it.  They were fawning over it, taking pictures and tearing up to tell me what an amazing daughter I really am.    They loved the mandarin oranges, the birthday message frosted and curled on ribbon, and the painstakingly perfect peach roses that had my grandma insisting "cut around them!" Thank you AJ's for the reasonable price, the cake and all the glory that came with it.

Village Tavern is a great place to go when you're in the mood for American food. They have a broad variety of appetizers and entrees, and a yummy selection of sandwiches too. The restaurant is insanely cozy, with bubbled glass window panes and a giant fireplace at the head of the main dining room.  Their french onion soup and New York Strip steak are my two favorites. Great place to go when you aren't sure what you're in the mood to eat -- there's so many options at Village Tavern. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars.

I've used Amazing Carpet & Tile Cleaners a few times now -- and I always look forward to the same great thorough results, fresh scent and amazingly friendly service.   Rick is fantastic and makes every effort to get you in the schedule even on their busiest weekend days. It's really cathartic watching him clean the carpet and make it like new each time. Definitely makes your place feel like home again.   I've used many other services in the valley before I found this amazing team, now I never call anyone else. They are the best -- you and your carpets need them, I know I have.

Yum, yum, yum, YUM. What can I say? I love lamb. The Persian Room is the perfect place to go on a quiet date, a family get-together, whatever. All of the food is absolutely delicious. There are all different types of rices you can order with your main feature; my favorite is the one that comes with sour cherries.  The service is always great and everyone seems to be genuinely happy to be there. You should try the eggplant hummus with the fresh basil and pita they bring out. So, so good. Service and food times can take a little longer here due to demand, so I'd make sure you're planning on making an evening of it. Enjoy!

The Good Egg is the perfect place to go when you have a hankering for tasty breakfast that won't keep you feeling guilty until dinner. Their menu includes lots of veggie-friendly/gluten-free options, but also appeals to meat lovers. (They have everyone covered.)  I love the veggie skillet with extra cheese. It's a must order. Naomi Garnice gives this place two thumbs up!

Tried Thai Basil for the first time Sunday.  It was amazing.. I ordered the Siamese Chowmein with a side of peanut sauce, (I don't what is in the peanut sauce exactly I only know it tastes like world peace).  My chowmein was delish and my friend's food was also tasty.  Be good to yourself and try Thai Basil.

I wouldn't change anything about Casey's -- I love it all: the open air, the door guys, the servers, even the bartender who takes out his love for Michael Jackson on patrons every Sunday night.  (Also, there's a special place in my heart reserved for any bar that serves potato skins with ranch after 12 AM.)  I have a serious soft spot for everything about this place.

We came here based on all the previous praise from fellow Yelpers. It's a popular buffet, but the line went fast. After 25 minutes we were enjoying food from everywhere. Sushi, steak, pasta, mac and cheese (I have a special place in my heart reserved for it), salads, cheesecake and more.   Unfortunately, we made it there for the last half hour of buffet time so the food wasn't as fresh as we were hoping, but overall, still delicious. (Be smarter than us and be there by 7:00.) Check out my photo of the lovely dessert shelves.

ZuZu has the happiest hour on earth from 5 - 7 (Monday through Friday). Sip on a hot and dirty martini for $3 with the Zombies as your soundtrack and take in the retro-sheik surroundings. Then cool down with the bramble (something yum involving lemon juice, blueberry and gin). The cheese plate and spinach artichoke dip are both a-m-a-z-i-n-g and will help you keep happy hour from becoming hammered hour. It's a must-do for reals.

OK, OK, I'm playing favorites, but I want to give props to the Pita Jungle on Shea.  Yes, that's right, props.  They have the same excellent food as the other PJs with servers who are engaging and attentive.  Tiffany was our server today.  Our order came quickly and she never stopped smiling.

When I was growing up my family used to pretend we were Italian and cook up some baked ziti.  Now we go here to do it instead.  Everything is served fresh, hot and bursting with flavor.   The servers are friendly and attentive, and they have live music sometimes.  When I went with my boyfriend for our birthdays they had this really awesome guy with a guitar playing Radiohead and Cure covers.  I've also been there when they had an accordion and some of the regulars there paused from enjoying their dinner to sing opera.    L-o-v-e, LOVE this place.

Great place! Usually you'll have 15-20 minutes to kill, but it's worth the wait. Everything is delicious. Everyone is smiling. I love eating there.   The strawberry Belgian waffle and apple pancake are both ridiculously awesome. The skillets are tasty too. We were there again today and Willie was our server - nicest guy ever.

Looking at possible biopsy and other concerns are a serious and sensitive issue for any woman. You're scared, emotional and when you go to a surgeon you want to feel like they and their staff genuinely care about your wellbeing. Unfortunately, I really didn't feel that way after my visit at Arizona Breast Consultants.  The office manager/receptionist who schedules appointments was amazing. She was very sweet and extremely professional and upbeat and gave me a great first impression of the office. Unfortunately, it was really down-hill from there.   The woman who asked me about my medical history and showed me to my room upfront was unfriendly and didn't so much as crack a smile; only made me more nervous and uncomfortable about the appointment.   The woman whose sole purpose was to work with the insurance told me that they'd bill me a certain amount for the biopsy and othe procedures upfront and then refund/charge the difference after finding out what my insurance would cover. I've never heard of this approach at any physician's office -- I've always been billed after the insurance so I'm not over or under-paying. Because of these unusual -- and somewhat shady! -- circumstances, I asked her to contact my insurance and find out what the amount was they would cover. She said almost combatively that contacting them about that was on me and said "that's not my job". Those were her exact words. I was at a total loss, does she know what it feels like to be worried for hours a day, every day for the weeks it takes you to get into the office that you could have Cancer? Does she care?  Dr. O'Neil herself was very friendly and intelligent, but seemed to be pushing for a biopsy before we could get all of the details (my prior history/files etc. that other doctors said were important). She actually said, "we can try to get your previous records OR we can just go ahead and do the biopsy today". She also mentioned one of her patients with Breast Cancer, which I'm sure was well-intentioned, but felt a little like a scare tactic. I'm a young woman, I don't take a biopsy lightly -- and Dr. O'Neil wanted to do the biopsy in addition to leaving in a clip and doing an additional ultra sound.This is very expensive, and insurance doesn't kick in till after $1,000.00. It's also an uncomfortable procedure that no woman under 35 really should do unless it's definitely absolutely hands-down necessary.She then wanted to have an ultra sound done every six months! I was really thrown off since the radiologist didn't think even the biopsy was necessary, but wanted me to go see a surgeon just in case.  I politely opted to wait to see if they could get my medical history from my previous doctors. The doctor said she'd request any notes as well in addition to x-rays. When I was leaving the office I saw the forms and there was nothing about notes, I actually added that myself to the request.   The office said they'd contact me to let me know what they heard -- no one ever did. Aside from the sweetheart of an office manager/receptionist, I really felt like their main concern was making money, not whether or not I'm at risk for Cancer. It was very upsetting. As a result I am now seeing Dr. Christi Sue Bourne instead. I'm more comfortable with how she and her staff approach my treatment and concerns  and feel that she genuinely cares about my health; at the end of the day that really matters to a patient.

I used to have a great experience with Cox Communications, and was excited to have them as a Cable provider again when I signed up for the service earlier this February after moving apartments. Every Cox encounter since then has been a complete NIGHTMARE.   1. I had a coupon and was told the installation of internet and cable would be "absolutely free". This was acknowledged by an account representative I spoke with and the service specialist who did the installation. I was charged an extra $60 on my first bill for the installation and had to go through two representatives and one billing supervisor to have the extra charges refunded, (a great way to spend an hour).  2. My Cox representative I signed up with told me that EZ pay (Auto-Pay wouldn't kick in till after the next billing statement) and that I needed to make the first payment manually. I did and then EZ Pay did work before it was supposed to so i was double-charged for the month. When I phoned Cox they said they'd just credit that towards my next month bill, I explained I couldn't budget the double charge and they needed to refund me for it. When they said it would take 2 business weeks to have the charge refunded via a check I called my bank to dispute the second charge instead.  3. AutoPay EZ Billing failed on Cox's end and instead of re-billing or calling me about the issue, they waited till this month to charge for two months and added a late fee and re-billing charge. I've been on the phone with their Billing Department for just under an hour and they've agreed to generously (sarcasm) waive the late fee they charged me for their Billing System not working but will not do anything more to keep me as a customer - NOTHING.  I have disabled auto-pay to prevent any other surprises and will be cancelling my services ASAP. This is the WORST customer service experience overall that I've had from any Internet Services or Cable Provider. I am thinking of reporting some of these false claims about AutoPay to the Better Business Bureau. Hopefully Century Link will offer a better customer experience!  Note: I spoke with Amber out of the Billing Center today and three supervisors, (Jay or) Jason, Stafia and some guy from Minnesota. Amber was the only employee who was compassionate or genuinely apologetic. Bravo to her at least.  Update: I received a phone call after writing to the VP of Customer Retention who was able to offer more positive solutions. He said the Easy Pay issue was something he would review with Customer Support. Adding an extra star to the review because of his effort.

Dr. Meharry is the absolute best. It's difficult to find precision, accuracy -and- someone who puts you at ease immediately with a great laugh and rapport. Dr. Meharry has nailed all-of-the-above, and she makes a the normally mundane and painfully routine process of eye exams enjoyable.   I'm always impressed by Dr. Meharry's ability to offer solutions personalized to each of her patients. I have a stronger astigmatism, making it harder to fit me for contacts, but she always has a great solution that's comfortable, smart and affordable. She is extremely patient and always makes time for my questions about eye wear and care, (and there are many).  Dr. Meharry is an all-around pro and an expert in her field. You won't be disappointed!!

Please don't take your pet here. I brought my cat in a few weeks ago thinking he was dehydrated and constipated. Dr. McKinnion decided without running any tests or x-rays that he had a tumor and I should 'make a decision' soon.   Thankfully I didn't make a decision that night after calling an animal oncologist I know and found out the next day he was in fact just dehydrated and constipated with buildup, something super common in senior cats.   I usually trust VCA and have always had a great experience with their McCormick location, but I will not return to this emergency clinic in the future. It concerns me that animals are being put down without any real tests to make a diagnosis.   My cat is alive and fully recovered and back to his normal self. I'm so thankful I didn't listen to Dr. McKinnion that night.   I found out the clinic recently lost their veteran doctors and it seems like now they are left with a scary lack of knowledge and experience. Take your pet somewhere else, it could save their life.

Holy de-lish! We love Picazzo's and we don't have to feel guilty about it because most of the menu is gluten-free and at least semi-healthy(ish). All of the pastas and salads are extra yummy. For desert, try the sundae with Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream and organic chocolate mint syrup. Yum!  Everything is delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely one of my favorite local chains in Scottsdale. Naomi Garnice gives it five stars.

Update: Wow, possibly the worst customer service experience I've ever had -- which is really saying something!! I have a month-to-month membership and was told there are no additional annual fees. (Apparently I made the mistake of trusting them at their word, at not reading about a *rate guarantee* fee that they charge in addition each year.)  My credit card number was stolen and I had to get a new card this month. Now, these crooks want me to pay a $25 bounce fee in addition to the monthly charge and my standard monthly rate. I thought that was hilarious and told them they were extremely misleading about their practices and that I will find another gym. I then was told that even after cancelling I'd have to pay up my account balance or it will be sent to collections.  I'm absolutely disgusted and now have to go on my birthday to try to get out of this sleezy gym in-person. I knew everything seemed a little sketchy when I started going there. BIG MISTAKE.

I am definitely pro Flo's. Every lunch is accompanied by a generous helping of won ton chips, sweet and sour sauce and a fresh salad with miso dressing. My favorite dish is their [insert any meat here] low mein. It's exploding with flavor and they let you customize your order if you want chicken and beef.   The service is always great. The servers and staff are ninjas, (yes, very appropriate) -- glasses of water appear before you look up from your menu and empty dishes disappear. Everyone who works there is always smiling and looking to help, even when they are serving half the city.  Best of all, this weekend, we discovered the $5 lunch special on Saturdays. The line was out the door, but it was so so worth the wait. Every lunch special highlighted in red is just five dollars until 3:00. I was reunited with my de-lish lowmein for less than what I'd spend at Subway. Now that's something to smile about.

I brunched (yes I used that as a verb) with some friends at Switch this Sunday.  I had an egg taco plus bacon; like most things with bacon, it was love at first bite.  We all shared a $6 pitcher of Mimosas.  Who doesn't love that?  The restaurant is very cute, it has that downtown Phoenix vibe.  Loved everything, although it was a little weird listening to house over brunch, but I digress... it was SO worth it.

We went here Thursday afternoon because we were staying at the Luxor and we were ready for some fancy drinks. The bar is beautiful with a great atmosphere, however; the customer service was lacking. After waiting 15 minutes (in a half empty bar), we gave our order. I was charged an additional $3 pour fee on an already pricey martini (not previously mentioned by our stoic server).   These 2 drinks took almost another 15 minutes to make it to the table. After the drinks finally came, our waitress put the receipt down and said "I'll be right back for this." So after waiting a total of half an hour and spending almost $30 on two beverages, we felt rushed out.

I just polished off a 1/4 lb burger and fries from Lucky Boy.  Holy freaking yum!  I haven't had one of their burgers since I was a kid and my Dad's office was right down the street.  I feel like I've just been reunited with a childhood friend, the one who can put a smile on your face anytime without even trying.

Let me start by saying, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food -- however; I do like the food here. The atmosphere is elegant and quiet and the menu has a great variety to it. There are also Indian music videos playing in the background with beautiful men and women wearing every color known to man. The chicken tikka masala was delish and I could live off of the garlic naan for a few days at least.

I love the ice cream here. I always order thin mint -- which is great if you like a natural minty flavor. I've noticed it's actually cheaper to buy by the pint than the scoop, I'll have to do that in the future instead.

How has this place been around for twenty years without me in it? This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant and I'm pretty obsessed with Italian food!   Everything I've tried here is delicious and seasoned to perfection. The staff is amazing and always friendly. The owner is there frequently and welcomes everyone with a smile.   Try the ravs, the ziti, something with pesto or really, anything. I'm always looking for excuses to go here. Don't miss out like I did for the last couple decades!!

Holy yum, they have the best happy hour EVER. We enjoyed nachos covered in everything good, guacamole, tortilla chips sugared and salted to perfection and 2 well drinks for $20. Yes, that's right, $20.   Our bartender had to cover someone's shift/stay later -- lucky for us though! Seriously the best food and customer service we had at the Luxor or anywhere on the strip. He kept our food and beverages coming quickly with a genuine smile and checked back with us to make sure we were set. (I didn't catch his name, but he was on Happy Hour shift September 9th.) Give the man a raise please and clone him repeatedly.

OMG best burger joint ever and with that friendly neighborhood feel that makes you think you're back East. Get the sweet potato fries. They come with a sugary dip that is freaking redic. I like topping my burgers with herbed goat cheese, spinach and their creamy balsamic. So so good!! I can't wait to go again.

I am in love with Cornish Pasty Co. The servers are friendly and the food is yummy.  Yup, that's right.  Yummy.  Everything has that made-from-scratch feel (cause it is).  I like the Greek salad (amazing pesto vinaigrette) and chicken pesto pasty best.  For you non pesto-junkies there's a full menu of delicious pasties to select from.    FYI: Save room for dessert! Just saying.

Holy, delicious!! Clockwork is better than the chains, and just as cheap.  Plus, they offer a wide selection of salads, gyros, sandwiches and pizzas.  My one true love is the Pendulum Clock White Pizza with ricotta cheese, mozzarella, fresh garlic, tomato and spinach.    Feel like eating pizza on Easter or Xmas?  I did.  And they were open.

I went to Postino Central last night, the food and wine were de-lish, the service was terrible. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and professional. After that, it really went downhill from there. Disclaimer: it was a very slow night; the restaurant was half-empty.  Part I: The first waiter promised to bring an extra side of brie since we were skimped a little on the fruit and cheese board. He stopped by a few times saying he'd do it (each about 20 minutes apart) and then finished his shift and left without letting us know. So we actually had no idea that we were server-less until we finally stopped to ask someone else.  Part II: The new server who took over was really nice, but kept disappearing. Half an hour after ordering a dessert he let us know he forgot to put it in. He was really polite about it and took it off our tab, but one of the other servers mentioned, "I thought you said you were full anyway". It was a little snarky and just made us a little more irritated about waiting for two desserts for 35 minutes.  Parking at this location isn't very convenient. I had to valet my car and then the valets wanted to take off for the night so they said they'd just give us our keys back. I felt obligated so I tipped them, but it left a weird taste in my mouth.  I was disappointed because I've heard such amazing things about Postino and it just seemed like the staff really didn't care about helping us. Maybe it was just an off night, it was slow and Thursdays are pretty hit-or-miss at most businesses. Either way I'm not in a rush to head back there. Aside from the initial hostess who sat us, the servers seemed a little fake; like they were just trying to get through the shift with tips, but didn't genuinely care at all about our experience. Saying they'd help, they'd be right back and then disappearing for twenty minutes, (or in the first server's case; forever). At the prices they charge, it's just not worth it.

Love this place. I went on a waxing sabbatical for a while, because every time someone did my brows they over-did it (and I just looked surprised all the time). Everyone at this salon does a great job, but Bree is my go-to girl. She's very professional, sweet and skilled.

There are few places where you can score a dynamite Philly cheesesteak in the valley and this is one of them. Great phillies and pizza and always at a great price.   Bonus: Free delivery!! Don't forget to tip your driver for the delish food.

I drink coffee.  I never pictured myself walking around a tea shop, picking up little tea pots off of shelves and talking about how fancy they'd look in my apartment... using words like "lovely" and "amazing" while looking at loose tea.  Never in a million years.  IT HAPPENED.  Yes, I went with my brother to Teavana gift-shopping for a family member, and all of these things really happened.  Derrick helped us.  (Derrick, if you're reading this, you are fantastic.)  Derrick talks about tea, gives you some insight and wafts the tea jars very graciously so you can catch the scent.  He's a great wafter, and in all seriousness, he knows everything about tea.  His manager, "Stephie," was also very helpful and just plain sweet.  I'll be visiting again to buy a tea set for my boyfriend's mother when we go to Chicago in October.  If you love tea or want to impress someone who does, go here.

I am head-over-heels for this place and I don't even drink coffee. I went with a friend this weekend and had a (delish) brownie coconut thingy.  The glass front of the coffee house was opened like a sun roof -- it was absolutely beautiful.  My friend loved her latte too!

I'm writing this review while I'm on my lunch break and fantasizing in DETAIL about the Red Goat Salad mixed with pistachios, strawberries and field greens and topped with a seriously generous helping of goat cheese.  In the words of the Grand Funk Railroad, it's some kind of wonderful.  What kind?  Basically, this is the best way I can sum up The Main Ingredient. I love A) my friends. I love B) TMI.  A loves B, and A and B are great together.  The hardwoood flooring, low lighting and tea lights make it a cozy spot for enjoying exceptional company with exceptional food.

Holy overpriced accessories and obnoxious staff!! Just went with my Mom and Grandma... a bunch of 'designer' brands I've never heard of... $120+. Also, a sign greets you when you come in, no food or beverage. The woman asked my 83 year old grandmother to place her iced coffee (with lid) on the counter. She was the only associate there, very icy and unhelpful. She's been referenced in all of the 'real' reviews; may be the owner.    I was not thrilled to see someone treat my mother and grandmother that way. My grandma told me how uncomfortable she was when we left, she felt like the sales associate was treating her like a criminal. Do NOT recommend.  PS and by the way, 2/3 of the positive reviews for this place are by obviously bogus accounts without photos or other reviews. Stop treating customers like crap and you might actually earn some real rave reviews. Do yourself a favor: hire people who like people to do the work for you.

It's not often that I leave a scathing review; this dealership deserves it.  After a month of working on a deal with AK, a salesman there, I went in to try to finance the car on my own.  As a first-time car buyer they gave me a 9.9 APR approval.  They showed me what my monthly payment would be and I clarified at least five times that it was for a 60 month term contract. "Yes, yes, 60 months, Naomi," I was reassured over and over (and over) again.  I had them write the numbers down and he had me sign it.  He said "once you sign this paper we have a deal -- that's what you're buying the car for". Elated,  I signed and test-drove the Elantra again and came in to fill out the finishing paperwork.  (FYI this car does not come with a spare tire -- "because these tires use nitrogen not oxygen". )   The salesman came back and told me he had made a mistake before and shown me the 66 month financing which had also had a lower APR.  The actual payment would be much higher.  I tried to argue that "a deal is a deal," but he wouldn't go down to the price that we shook on just fifteen minutes earlier. The "sales director" or something Sam overheard and would not honor the "deal" either.  He ended up berating my father who came along for the fun, calling him an "incompetent," although ironically, he didn't pronounce the word correctly.  The manager came out to tell me that he just couldn't make that deal and said that even if he did I wouldn't be happy at that point;.  He also mentioned that this salesman had a history of making these types of "mistakes" which was very reassuring.  I went to another dealership and got a 2.9 APR (even as a GASP dreaded first-time buyer).  I dealt with honest people there and didn't have to go through a near-crying episode in front of a roomful of strangers.  Do yourself a favor: AVOID this dealership.  It's all bait n' switch and no business ethics as you can see from the previous reviews.

What a great place, and aptly named too (you should see this parking lot in full-swing on a Monday lunch break). We actually discovered Traffic Jam on Yelp and we were not disappointed. They have a great selection, it's actually a great go-to for when you and your friends are hankering for vastly different lunch selections. Take my last visit there, me: lasagna, the boyfriend: french toast, (and all of it was d-licious). The couple who run the joint are really friendly and they have an adorable traffic jam motif with toy cars crawling the walls.

I love that I can eat a burger smothered in goat cheese while listening to my favorite Spoon album and other music you don't often hear out. The atmosphere is modern and fun although the paintings of adorable black and white cows on the walls offer no reassurance when you're sinking your teeth into red meat ... just saying. The service is good our waitress was great and very accommodating. One of the other servers was barely covered by her why-am-I-wearing-these-in-winter-tiny-white-shorts which I thought was out of place and icky in a food service environment. The burgers were great, the fries were OK but the milkshakes were definitely the highlight of the evening.

OK, where do I start? Oh yes, the reservation. Called in a reservation for a company dinner this Sunday for last night which never hit the books. So our party including execs had to sit at the 'community table' which my manager was not excited about, thanks, Vig.  Flash back to the valet, the parking entrance is confusing and I took an unintentional detour and then had to flag someone down after 10 minutes because they were completely ignoring me. They said they had to help the people in line, but I had been there before any of the cars arrived.  Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'. The woman who ordered wine, (me of course), had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'checking to see if they had it'.  My burger ordered medium rare was charred to a crisp that couldn't even be drowned out by the Secret Sauce. Saving grace -- the fries were good, yay.  Also, who thought that putting chipotle in everything on the menu was a good idea? Not thrilled, not going back and certainly not recommending this for any corporate or group outings.Really disappointed, I've always heard good things about The Vig and enjoyed going to the bar there.

What can I say? It's fresh, it's delicious and it's cheap. I love the convenience of being able to order in-home delivery too. They're also very quick. I usually get the #8, Italian sub. It's pretty gigantic, (you can save half for a second lunch later).

Love Someburros. Great place to get cheap, tasty Mexican food that tastes authentic. This is the perfect place to swing by when you're in a hurry or want some take-out or want Mexican without paying to 'eat out'. My one complaint is they don't serve salsa, only hot sauce, (no bueno). They also have a decent selection of Mexican beers!

Holy delicious, it doesn't get any better than this. The BF and I eat here for lunch routinely on the weekends and it's always amazing. Order the prosciutto sandwich; it comes with a soft Italian cheese we couldn't pronounce that melts in your mouth and a delicious fig jam. I could eat here daily.

Seriously love this place and it's dangerously close to my apartment.  Nice, bright space usually packed with high school kids and twenty somethings. They have an ample selection of tempting flavors and toppings.    Beware: there are carob chips and chocolate chips, spoons are labeled. I made the fatal mistake of mixing these up last week.  I'm currently in full swoon for Georgia Peach, Lotta-Chocolate and Blueberry.

I love Mood Swings salon and have been going there forever. My stylist, Lauren, always makes my hair look amazing. She doesn't go rogue, and instead asks questions and really listens to what you want to do with your style and how much length your looking to lose before you ever get your hair wet. She does things with color that are shockingly beautiful.  The staff is very timely and professional. Lauren had to call out sick for my last appointment, and the front desk associate helped me to quickly reschedule for the same evening with Jessica, who did an equally impressive job. I really love this salon, my only complaint is the parking on Mill; but it's worth it!

Dear Sharon,  Your Paradise Bakery is by far the friendliest Paradise Bakery. Ever. I'm disappointed it just opened because I will be moving to the other side of town at the end of the month and now I know the best PB is right here. I went to your location tonight and I fell completely in love with your staff -- they are amazing. Everyone smiled, asked how they could help, and even asked if we were having a good night.   Now I'm going to name names: Christian the greeter was very engaging and couldn't have been more helpful. He checked on us to make sure our dining needs were met. Cassie let my mom sample her soup of choice and was a complete sweetheart. David was sure to go over the menu with us and was very accommodating with our breads of preference and Chase was also extremely courteous. Your entire staff was perfect; do not let them go.   Everyone was professional, up-beat and obviously happy to be working there, the smiles never ended. And that really makes your restaurant paradise.   Cheers,  Naomi

You know, accidents happen... so when I dropped my phone face-down on the asphalt I rushed over to UBreakiFix. I've also been to the Phoenix location, (I've been a little on the clumsy side this year).  In less than an hour they had my iPhone patched up and for less than $100. I really love the whole concept behind this place and the representatives there are always pretty friendly too.

It breaks my heart to give a one star review, but here we go:    On one trip I had some basic repairs done to my car and the rep told me it wasn't covered under warranty.  I saved hundreds of dollars by putting my foot down and telling him I wouldn't pay till he looked up my warranty.   Today a salesman called me trying to get me to buy some new wheels because my car is over 97K miles.  I politely declined saying I'm very happy with my current ride, and "Nissans go on forever".  He continued the sales pitch by asking me if I have any money.  Bad, Riverview, bad!  OK, that's all.

Definitely loved Drybar. Enjoy a mimosa or a glass of champagne while your stylist makes your hair look flawless. The counter tops also include phone charging docks, so you can recharge your phone while you revamp your look.   There's a complete 'menu' of hair styles. I did the Mai Tai, but every look I saw was fresh and beautiful. I took a bachelorette party here and everyone instantly fell in love.

Love Teharu overall. It's not the fanciest sushi ever, but the fish is fresh, delicious and (for lack of better words), cheap! We love dropping in here for a week-day date and a meal we don't have to feel guilty about later.  The staff is always extremely friendly. I'd only change a few things: A) please change the Muzak station once in a while -- I hear Gyote in my mind everytime I look at a sushi roll B) if there are tables open, seat customers instead of sectioning them off -- it's really irritating to have to wait twenty minutes when five or more tables are open C) continue making fresh rolls after seven o'clock; the selection gets limited and fishier as the night goes on.

What can I say, I love Portillo's. My favorite dinner here is an Italian beef (prime roast beef, soaked in au jus type sauce) sandwiched between pillows of the softest bread imaginable and then dunked again into sauce. It's amazing, and messy, but mostly amazing.  Also, the cheese fries are de-lish. I normally am anti-fake-liquid-cheese, but this cheese is like a creamy bowl of macaroni and cheese sent from heaven to dip your perfect french-fries in; a dangerous combination!  The chocolate cake is delicious. I also love the chocolate cake shake -- chocolate shake with chocolate cake crumbles. Yum, yum, yum! Naomi Garnice gives it two thumbs up!!

Craving some delish takeout? Go to Giant Rustic Pizza. Their ingredients are fresh, flavorful and gluten-free. They have a wide variety of topping options, appetizers, (wings, garlic bloom, etc.) and yummy specialty pizzas. Their crust is amazing, really soft and baked to perfection. You really owe it to yourself to stop by. I love this place.

Butterfly Wonderland made our weekend. I love, love, love this place. There's a butterfly theater where you learn about the lives of butterflies via 3D, there's a very cute gift shop, a cacoon gallery where you can see butterflies taking form and of course; the habitat.  I've been reading some of the other reviews. Yes of course the habitat is hot and humid, these specific breeds of butterflies are found in the rainforest; other conditions would kill them. Still, I'm positive that even people who aren't either A) cold all the time or B) butterfly enthusiasts will love it. I'm actually warm all the time and I fell in love with the place. Butterflies float right by you, sometimes land on your clothes and flutter in bowls of fruit, flowers and on plants. They are beautiful. It's really calming and amazing to see them so close-up.   Two helpful hints for the habitat: A) you aren't supposed to touch the butterflies with your hands, it's not good for them and B) look at the ground when you're walking, some of the butterflies relax down there.  There's also a small aquarium area with fish and you can pet a stingray. You can see bees in their natural habitat, ants and scorpions also. It would be cool if they had a ladybug exhibit too!  Of course, I bought the limited-time-offer lifetime membership, $100 for lifetime access. I know we'll be back many (many) times. I absolutely recommend this place for a date/family outing/engagement proposal/some-much-need alone time... basically anyone should be able to manage an excuse to go here.

I LOVE this place. It's cheap, it's delicious and it doesn't make you feel miserable later on like other fast food-y type places. The bean and cheese burrito is my fave, no lard!  The ladies who work at this joint, (mostly women), are the nicest. They always act happy to see me and now know me by name; I may have a burrito problem.  Plus, the company is involved in the community. Just last week they did a #CarneforaCause day, giving 20% of their daily profits valley-wide to Phoenix Children's Hospital. Yummy and altruistic, love that.

Hopdoddy is one of my new faves. They have a killer atmosphere and everyone working there is all smiles and "how can I help you"s. I love the rustic, Texas feel and the cute little sayings posted around.   A couple notes:  1) Be prepared to wait: I've waited up to 35 minutes, it's not bad, but I suspect I'll be less thrilled about it when it's really cold or hot outside. You wait in front of the restaurant, then wait in a line that conveniently circles the bar. It's worth the wait and usually there are free handouts of margarita samples, shake samples and fries.  2) The Mexican cola 'on tap' at the soda machine is not as good as the real deal, so just order the bottle of Mexican coke if that's your preference.  3) Sassy sauce is a tangy mayo they'll give you on demand, reminds me of horsey sauce, I'm a fan!  Get ready to wait for a great burger. My favorites so far are the classic and the Greek -- lamb with feta, onion, cucumber and more. YUM!

Perfect date night location, makes you feel like you're in New York City! Absolutely love this spot. Try the fondu appetizer with pear and pork 'butt'... so delish. The drinks are all amazing, but my favorite concoction has been the Fortified Fig -- Gin, whipped up with something yummy including egg and cinnamon. I can't wait to swing by and check out their lunch menu.

Dr. Meharry is the absolute best. It's difficult to find precision, accuracy -and- someone who puts you at ease immediately with a great laugh and rapport. Dr. Meharry has nailed all-of-the-above, and she makes a the normally mundane and painfully routine process of eye exams enjoyable.   I'm always impressed by Dr. Meharry's ability to offer solutions personalized to each of her patients. I have a stronger astigmatism, making it harder to fit me for contacts, but she always has a great solution that's comfortable, smart and affordable. She is extremely patient and always makes time for my questions about eye wear and care, (and there are many).  Dr. Meharry is an all-around pro and an expert in her field. You won't be disappointed!!

YUM! Really love this place. The service was amazing and the fish was fresh. The sushi wasn't as inexpensive as some other Revolving Sushi Bars, but I enjoyed it much more. The fish was d-lish and the restaurant is beautiful. Definitely going to make it back.
