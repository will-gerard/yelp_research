I want to say, before I embark on this journey of writing this review, I am not a gambler, nor will I ever be due to my ill fated luck with the whole ordeal.  Anyway, I do not hold this casino in high esteem. Granted, I have only been there once. Although the casino is extremely spacious, and other people have vouched for the above average quality of the food (I didn't get the chance to eat it), I disliked it.  Why, you ask? Ladies and gentlemen, it is because of the extremely rude service. When I entered the casino, I was stumbling, because I am a woman, I am tired, and I am wearing three inch heels. After a night of dancing and debauchery, I should be allowed to feel a little bit of exhaustion. If I didn't, then I would have been labeled as a drug abuser.  When I showed the bouncer my ID, he made rude inquiries. He asked me why I was stumbling, and I calmly told him I was wearing heels that hurt my feet. He then proceeded to ask me why, and I quipped that I went to a club, and I felt like it. He definitely thought I was a hazard to the safety of the casino.  The rest of the night was a blur. I had a bad taste in my mouth after he called in some other staff through his radio transmitter. My friends didn't enjoy it, point blank.   Maybe next time, I will be treated better.   If not, there's always Gila River Casino.

I should utilize the fact that I have a library within reasonable driving distance from me. Anyway, it has been a couple of years since I last frequented this place. Although it hasn't changed drastically, there is a cafe that sells delicious smoothies! I was pleasantly surprised. After spending minutes of sifting through books in the used books section, and in the inner part of the library, I definitely was craving something delicious to drink - and I was reasonably satisfied.  The library also offers a decent-sized used books selection. I was tempted by the numerous National Geographics they had, and they were selling for a quarter an issue! I was heaven. They have a nice collection of non-fiction, fiction, and so forth.  4 stars for Chandler PUBLIC Library! Yipee!

After hearing all the hype about the Persian Room, I decided to check it out with a friend of mine. Or rather, he suggested checking it out, and I graciously abided, seeing that I never pass up any opportunities for new culinary endeavors.  I was definitely pleased with the ambience of the Persian Room. Unfortunately, I didn't dress as appropriately as I would have liked, but contrary to popular belief, I didn't feel as out of place as I initially assumed I would.   The drinks were wonderful, the appetizer (eggplant hummous) was wonderful, and the actual main entree lived up to standards. I had the chicken filet kebab, and it made me tingle from the top of my head to my toes. I loved it. I am, by no means, an expert on Persian food. I am sure that there are cities, such as Los Angeles, that have numerous Persian restaurants that provide wonderful food. However, I think this place is wonderful. The service was quick, and our waitress was so friendly and warm. I loved my experience, and I definitely will check out the Persian Room again...and again...and again. I'm sure I will frequent it so often, they will want me to leave.

I will say one thing about Barcelona. It is spacious, so for all the claustrophobic people out there, you'll definitely not feel like a sardine in a tin can. I love how you have your options open - if you'd like to feel the sultry summer breeze, or lack of, you can sit outside, or if you are freezing you can go to the main building, and dance your drunk ass off. Yes, the live band's slightly cheesy, but when you're inebriated, who cares?   Caution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat. I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food. This is definitely not for people who are going out, expecting to meet a ton of young people, and surround yourself with recent college graduates. Yes, there is diversity. I've seen young to extremely old. I've met my share of extremely weird characters, like this man who was trying to pull girls from the dance floor or the bar, to share the VIP experience with his son who was celebrating his birthday. It sort of felt like he was trying to pimp us out to his son, but that's a different story all together.   Barcelona's is a cougar's den, and the drinks aren't satisfactory for the wallet, but I do emphasize how I love the spaciousness of this place! I suppose that's the only reason I enjoy it, anyway. I usually relax outside, and the dancing side of me doesn't come into action here. With the live band, it's hard to shake my moneymaker, anyway.

Oh, Vegas. Why must you torture me so? Every time I swear I will never drunkenly stomp down the strip again, it seems as though, with a click of my heels, I'm magically home again.  This past summer, I decided to venture out on a journey to an oasis in the middle of the desert, called "Vegas" to some, but known as "Sin City" to many. My roommate and I decided we should try something new for a change, since whenever I am in Vegas, I am seen stumbling around Excalibur, trying to find my room but having no recollection whatsoever wherever it is. I am geographically challenged. So, we decide to stay at Monte Carlo. It looks pleasant enough on the website, and a five hour journey later (give or take an hour), the interior looked impressive.  While waiting in line impatiently, we were slightly spooked because the lady in front of us was rambling about how dirty her room was, and how she filed several complaints about it. She proceeded to fill us in on all the gory details, and I was slightly perturbed. Had we made a mistake? I was tired, and anxious to be in the comfort of my room. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we were at the front of the line, checking in. I was slightly annoyed, because they were under staffed, and there was no distinct formation...it was all haphazard, to say the very least.  But I was happy on one note. There was a bell hop, and he was happy to serve us. We were also in no mood to find parking, so we went through valet. They were nice guys, so score for that. Anyway, on to the room. When we got to our room, I was content. I immediately flopped on to the bed, and noticed how soft it was. It would do for later on, when I would more than likely be buzzed, and even a cold, hard bathtub would do for a sleeping arrangement. The bathroom was quaint, but the lighting did not flatter, but I was okay with that. There also was a floor length mirror right in front of my bed, and while it wasn't the most flattering...I felt like it added ten pounds...(or was it my endless drinking that caused that?)...it was convenient for when I wanted to straighten my hair.  The first night, a friend joined us from Mandalay Bay, and we were determined to go out, but we were side tracked by a bar. Funnily enough, we never did go to the club we were originally thinking of going to, but spent our night away, getting intoxicated. The bartenders were a blast, and we did not feel sleepy until eight in the morning, when both of their shifts ended. I believe that place was called Ignite Lounge, and while my other friends went out, I was quite content staying within the safety of my casino for the night. It was a ritual throughout the trip, and amazingly enough, I met a couple of regulars that were staying at the Monte Carlo, as well. It transformed in to a kind of "Cheers" joint. I also met another fabulous bartender at Hit Lounge, and he entertained me for a couple of hours, talking about Las Vegas shenanigans, and actually told me to come on through later on if I wasn't going out, so we could throw back a couple of shots together. He was an older guy, but boy, he was so fun and relaxed! I suppose this is why I love casino bars. Since I'm from Arizona, and I frequent Scottsdale, I am accustomed to the snooty clientele that the nightlife attracts. I loved the chill factor here.  And lastly, the food. Well, I went to the standard food court. We were supposed to all go to a buffet, but that plan was a bust. It definitely was an improvement to my eating fiasco at Excalibur. My whole diet consisted of a six inch sub from Subway, and that was my ambrosia for my duration of the trip.  Would I come back and stay here? Abso-frockin'-lutely. I would stay here, JUST for the bartenders at Ignite lounge. Cool, cool dudes. We were even supposed to go to a strip club with them, but that will hopefully be another story for next time. Damn you, Vegas!   PS: And may I add, I guess I had a pleasant stay because of the company I kept here. Remember, it's not the places you go to that counts...it's the people that can make or break an experience.

The two times that I have been there have been a great time. Granted, I haven't frequented this spot in over a year and a half, but when I think of Studio 54, I have a whimsical look on my face. The DJ was great...well, from what I can remember! In the beginning, his set was kind of shaky, but he improved greatly and had everyone dancing. Anyway, I'll try to make this review as concise as possible.  First and foremost, especially when I'm kind of buzzed, I always like watching go-go dancers. I don't know...perhaps I have a drunken fascination with them? I do agree with a fellow yelper...the go go dancers were ADORABLE, and very friendly. The bartenders always had a smile on their faces, and definitely weren't pretentious snots. Lastly, the people were so friendly and low key. Yes, Vegas is all about  the glitz and glamor in regards to nightlife...I've been to XS and Tao and I enjoyed every minute of it. But I'm the kind of girl that likes to dress up, and then dress in a sexy top and jeans and have a good time dancing without worrying about meeting Affliction wearing, overly gelled hair douches. The girls are another story. So yes, if you're looking for a low key night of dancing, drinks, and a good night I suggest you go to Studio 54!

I'm a pretty tough cookie to please, and I rarely give my five stars out (with an exception to book stores), but I truly believe this place deserves it. First of all, I visited FEZ for my friend's birthday party, and when I walked into the chic doors, I immediately fell in love. I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance of this place! Service was prompt, and I decided to try the sweet fries...and months later, I can still taste the sugary goodness of them. Drinks were delicious, as well! Over all, I had fun at FEZ, and I hope, and will, return shortly!

I should have paid  heed to my friend's incessant complaints about this place, but I'm the type of girl that has to go through a bad experience to learn from it. I am trying to gather my thoughts together to explain why I think this establishment deserves such a low rating. Anyway, let me begin. I should have been more observant before venturing here. From the outside, I saw a bunch of little men with Troll-esque hair to compensate for their short stature. They were embarking in the "fist pumping" movement. Blech. No doubt, they thought they were the chosen people. I ignored the unsettling feeling in my stomach, and due to my friends that desired to go here, I held my breath and walked in.  Before I go on, I will add that I have been here before. During the summer, I would stumble in here on the later half of my Monday nights. My friends preferred Fat Tuesday's for their dollar drinks and laid back crowd, but I always wanted to go to Zuma to look at the "pretty people" with their meticulous hair cuts, and their blemish free faces. I suppose I am slightly masochistic.   Anyway, I guess I have had it. I am boycotting this place, no matter how tempting it looks. The bartenders spend more time gazing upon their reflection in the mirror and catering to their narcissistic tendencies than serving their clientele. The bouncers act like they have had Botox on their faces and can not muster a smile, unless their "douche" friends swat them in their arms and that's when their face cracks. I mean, there are one or two that are tolerable. Birds of a feather flock together. May I add that this is the watering hole for men and women that think they are levels above everyone in this place. This is Tempe. This isn't a glamorous red-carpet event.  I'm sorry, but when I go out, I want to be surrounded by people that don't look down on me. I found something even more amusing. The people that were acting the most arrogant were inches shorter than I was. Napoleon Complex, anyone? Oh, and yes...as far as the drinks go. They are mediocre. Nothing special.   Kiss my brown ass, Zuma! If I ever venture by your side again, I'm going to Cue Club where the people actually are classier than you.

After being a reputed Excalibur lover (mainly for the inexpensive hotel rates and my reasoning being that most of the time I'm going to be too inebriated to care), I finally stayed at another casino. My family decided to have a family reunion, and we decides on Vegas to be the spot where we all congregated together. Although I do enjoy fine wining and dining, I usually prefer cheap spots because the outrageous prices for drinks (although it's a well known fact) can burn a hole in anyone's wallet. On the day of our departure, my Uncle forced us to have brunch and he decided on having it at Studio Cafe. I'm definitely not a breakfast kind of person...my idea if one bowl of cereal, and that will satisfy my hunger pangs. But since we were all being forced to spend quality family time, I had to conceal my disappointment and attend. When we were seated (which was a relatively painless process since we weren't in Vegas on one of the crowded weekends) I scanned the menu for something comparatively cheap. Voila!  My mouth salivated for some French Toast, and that's what I ordered. It was quite expensive, and yes, I do agree, Vegas is expensive but I had to pay 14 bucks for it! I envisioned how moist and delicious it would be, with large slices of bread, divided in four mouth watering slices. My hunger pangs were taking over now, and I was slightly impatient at waiting. The service was quick, especially for a group as large as ours (10) and we received our food in a span of twenty minutes. When they handed me my French toast, I was utterly disappointed! The slices were unbelievably small! I shrugged my shoulders, and generously poured maple syrup all over my meal, eagerly anticipating a bite. Again...disappointment! I finished it up, anyway, because for the money paid, I felt guilty about wasting a bite. Usually, I savor French toast, but I was repulsed by it and tried to repress my nausea. The only good thing about the meal was that it was small, and I finished it quickly. What a painstaking process! I'm not knowledgeable about other items on the menu, but I won't be eager to return. Sorry, Studio Cafe! I love MGM, but not you.

Delicious. What do you think of delectable 'chaat' that melts in your mouth? In a way, you're always left unsatisfied after you dig in to these tasty treats, simply because you yearn for more. And yearn I did! I've been frequenting this place for the past two years or so. It is relatively close by to campus, and is definitely on the route to my house, so if it's 100+ degrees and you're experiencing a craving for a flavorful treat, what better place is there other than Little India?   Honestly, I haven't had a myriad of foods here. When I like something, I'm quite obstinate, and I stick to it. However, I have tasted bhel puri at five or so other Indian "chaat" places peppered around the valley, and nothing can compare to the bhel puri in Little India! Anyway, instead of yelping about it, I'm going to shut off my laptop, leave campus in an hour or so, and then go to Little India because I'm hungry.

Cherry Lounge. How I despise thee. Perhaps I've had horrible experiences, and I'm writing a biased review. But everytime I've decided to go there, I've loathed it. The bar (sorry, I suppose the correct term is "lounge" but it is a sorry excuse for one) is extremely run-down, and you automatically want to take a shower when you step in the place. I'll say this much. The bartenders are friendly, to say the least. I'm always pleased with the service, and the drinks are alright. However, the security guards are tools. I mean, I understand you have to have a mean demeanor, but come on, can't you smile a bit? This one dude gruffly told me to leave, and I tried to converse with him, and he automatically had a "holier-than-thou" attitude. You can suck it. I'm definitely not trying to flirt with you. Anyway, people that frequent this place - and yes, there are exceptions to the rule, so don't take offense: under-age boys that are insecure with their masculinity, and have the desire to dress in jeans ten sizes too large, and a mouth to match it. Honestly, I'd have to be dead drunk to even be near this place. Yuck.

Ah, Iguana Mack's. There are so many words that are on the tip of my tongue, but they are far too explicit for a virgin yelper's eyes, so I shall opt for the "sugar-coating" route.  If you are a fellow Chandler resident, you can truly empathize with the fact that there aren't many bars to choose from (atleast, not to my knowledge). Being a closet alcoholic, I want to choose a bar that's atleast within a ten mile radius so I can sober up, and drive home without attracting a cop's attention. (Warning: Do not attempt to try at home.) Occasionally, when Tempe seems miles away, and Scottsdale isn't even an option, I go to Iguana Mack's with my friends.  The first time, I had a joyful experience. The bar was packed, the alcohol was flowing through my bloodstream, the packed, small dance floor seemed appealing, and the liquor impaired my taste in men and dancing partners. However, when I decided to go to Iguana Mack's again, I realized how horribly slow the service is, and how inattentive the bartenders are. I decided that it was endurable, and decided to give Iguana Mack's another shot - I adamantly believe in equality and justice.  Can I say RUDE, RUDE, RUDE? Horrible, horrible service. The food is mediocre, at best. I suppose when you're boozing, you aren't overly particular about your choice in foods. I would have had an alright time if it weren't for the rude servers.  Other than that, this place is happening, by Chandler standards...it's densely packed on Thursday nights. However, I'd rather risk a couple more miles and go to Maloney's in Tempe.

You know how some people are in desperate need of help for their gambling problem, or their problem with alcoholism? I have a huge problem with purchasing books constantly, at a faster rate than I can read. The end result? I have holes in my pockets from where my money was, prior to going to the book store. The solution? A bad ass book store that sells used books!  Bookman's is an orgasmic haven for bibliophiles alike. They have a huge selection, with books I have never thumbed through in places that I usually frequent (i.e Barnes and Noble.) Whenever I have the chance of going, I always end up with a satisfactory smile on my face. You will not be disappointed with the vast selection of books and movies, and computer games. It's like an oasis in a barren desert.  So, if buying books is your vice, and the prospect of going into rehab doesn't appeal to you, go to Bookman's. The prices can't be beat, and you'll be able to pay your electricity bill again, enabling you to be able to read at night.

We stumbled upon this gem due to finding an Indian restaurant for my traditional grandparents that can't digest anything non traditional. I have developed an aversion to Indian food, due to the constant need to find different locales that offer this culinary delight to my grandparent's pleasure. So, when I saw a sandwich shop, I decided to buy a sandwich along with my mother and my aunt. Whenever I frequent Subway, I always order a foot long, due to my voracious and manly appetite. However, you get more than you bargain for and a small is the only size I could envision myself digesting! It's H-U-G-E! And mmm it was delicious :) My taste buds are singing in a symphony of joy when I envision it...I'm going to jump in the car and GO RIGHT NOW!

I can remember last year fondly, albeit a little vaguely due to my constant alcohol induced mind. I decided that I wanted to savor life, and enjoy each and every waking moment, which meant one thing of course: to visit a little oasis in the midst of the desert that is aptly named "Sin City." Last year, I decided to pay a visit to this gem of a town not once, not twice, but a whopping THREE times.  My friend from California decided to visit me in Arizona, and since he exudes innocence, I decided that I should corrupt him with epileptic lights, and casinos that reek of cigarettes and regret. However, I decided to mix in a little spontaneity and instead of booking directly on a casino website, I decided to gamble on Hotwire and see what hotel I would get as a result. After careful sleuthing, especially with the disclaimer that it indeed was NOT a casino, I knew we were going to be spending one luxurious night at the Trump. I was ecstatic, and so was my friend. After gently prodding my roommate to accompany us, we were ready to proceed with our whirlwind trip.  Five hours later, we arrived. We had a bellhop generously help us with our luggage, and had our doors held for us as we entered. Strangely enough, I felt like Kevin Mcallister when he entered the Plaza Hotel. After being offered an upgrade for an additional fifty dollar charge, we kindly rejected the offer and went up to our room. And my, what a room it was! It was like our own mini studio apartment. The bathroom was to die for. There was a shower for some sexy time, a bath tub with jets, and a mandatory toilet for....well, you know. After playing some sleazy drinking games, we decided to head towards the strip. The whole night was a blur. I vaguely remember my friend saying that he was sleepy so he decided to end the night early, and I decided to drink celebratory shots for no apparent reason with my roommate. At two in the morning, we briefly ate and then spent our night soaking our hurting feet in the tub.  The next morning is when all the trouble began. I was extremely hungover, and my friends were hungry so we utilized the free shuttle to Caesar's palace, and ate. My stomach was churning, my head was throbbing, so I didn't savor my food so I left my friends there and took the shuttle back. Thankfully, I didn't have to wait long. The next couple of hours were sheer agony for me. I was indebted with gratitude that they let me do a late check-out, and by the time I actually could function, it was  four thirty in the afternoon. They did not try to charge us, or reject my plea for late checkout.  All in all, I loooooved this hotel. I will stay again. You do get what you pay for. Fortunately, I didn't have to cleanse my life savings out of my wallet out for a night's stay due to Hotwire! I will stay again. However, my liver has thoroughly suffered my Vegas craze of 2011, so I will not be paying another visit for quite some time. Hopefully the world doesn't end by then. (*insert sarcasm.*)

Firstly, I have an important confession to make. I'm quite a drunkard. So, living in Phoenix, it is quite difficult for me as cab fare can be quite expensive, and cops are ready to pounce on foolish prey like me. So, last weekend, my best friend and I decided to have a weekend of debauchery and book a room at Hotel Indigo. I've heard my friends raving over it, so I said to myself, "Why not?" I'm glad that I decided to.   From the minute I stepped in, I loved the abstract interior. Hotel Indigo isn't conventional, and I loved that. Another thing that I loved is how inexpensive it is, compared to many other hotels. We were fairly close by to the clubs, and if not, cab fare was inexpensive if we wanted to go to a club that is further down in Old Town. The only gripe I had in my room was the AC seemed to not work that well. However, all in all, I had a great experience.   The breakfast that I added in to our hotel room deal was marvelous. My friend and I had fun talking to the guys behind the counter, and when my friend inquired about the theme behind Hotel Indigo, he explained that the paintings are all symmetrical, abiding by Da Vinci's reccuring theme in his paintings. I actually am considering coming back to eat their food. Yummy.   I will definitely return to Hotel Indigo when I'm too drunk to drive home to Chandler.

I have been a fan ever since I decided to try the Curry House. Finally, a restaurant within the vicinity of my home!  I have been to my share of Indian restaurants, and let me tell you, I am finally happy to say that there is one up to par with my standards. Phoenix does not offer various culinary adventures, or restaurants that make my taste buds water by just hearing the name. Curry House has proved me wrong.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is impeccable, and Curry House offers various other dishes as well. I suppose the reason why I adore it so much is because the food tastes like food you could get in India. Many other restaurants try to emulate this style, but Curry House has succeeded.

Firstly, let me state that I'm a loyal pizza fun. I love grubbing on pizza, letting the melted cheese drip from my mouth, savouring the delectable treat. So when I saw Old Chicago which is located a few palrty miles (if even that) from my house, I shot through the top of my car.  I've never had the pleasure of visiting Chicago, so I can't compare notes. However, I was surprisingly pleased by the quality of the food. I ordered a deep dish pizza, and I loved every bite of it. Old Chicago has a decent drink menu, so if you feel like accompanying your pizza with an ice cold margarita or beer, I promise you won't be disapponted.  Service was great, food was great! Four stars for me.

So, I have recently indulged in this froyo phase. I know, I am slightly late but I discovered the awesomeness of frogen yogurt when I was in San Diego with one of my friends. After I ventured back to my home turf, I thoroughly researched different venues that offered this delectable treat. I wanted to go somewhere that was relatively close, but the one I tried out was mediocre at best. Then, after looking at other reviews, I decided to go by campus and try Yogurtland. I had a little bit of the tart flavor, and a bit of strawberry, and I topped it off with strawberries, mango pieces, and almonds. I immediately was hooked. In addition to that, it was cheap! I love, love, love it. I have gone 5 times after that, and this is within a ten day span. Trust me, you'll be a fan.

I consider myself somewhat of a frozen yogurt connoisseur, so when I spotted a frozen yogurt shop conveniently located next to my salon, I was ecstatic. Although I'm slightly embarassed to say this, I hated the inconvenience of driving to Tempe to get my frozen yogurt on. I didn't really like Golden Spoon, the main reason being I am thoroughly spoiled by self serve frozen yogurt.   Anyway, I love the taste of the tart yogurt here. I can't really pinpoint it, but my taste buds were singing with joy. I also liked the abundance of toppings, and they actually had pomegranate! By the time I paid for my yogurt, I couldn't wait to dig in...and it tasted as good as it looked. I've never glanced twice at other frozen yogurt places, and although there have been times when I was dragged out to a different place, I always found myself comparing everything to Kokomo.  Anyway, since I was salivating all over my laptop keyboard, I have decided to run out and get some frozen yogurt. Try this place! It won't disappoint. And I agree, there are some cuties working behind the counter.

I had no idea that this is where Six used to be. I suppose this is due to the fact that I am directionally impaired and my memory is horrible. However, I have to say that I enjoyed it thoroughly when I went Friday night. The crowd is young and good looking, which is a given if you frequent Old Town. The drinks err on the expensive side, but that's also a given if you're in Old Town...If you're disgusted by the prices, just think of Vegas and you'll be satisfied.   Anyway, the music is the one thing that I enjoyed. Although the club was crowded, I loved dancing to the beats. Usually, in my opinion, it is a hit or miss in regards to the DJ. I didn't lose interest in dancing, which is what I usually do within five minutes...and even in less of a time frame when I'm sober. I liked it. Although I don't go to Scottsdale frequently, due to the distance, I will definitely check it out again the next time I'm in that part of town.

I love discovering a diamond in the rough when I least expect it. One of my best friends from Houston had come to visit me for my birthday, and she has a weakness for hummus so I decided to utilize my handy dandy Yelp app on my phone, and stumbled upon this little gem. When we both went in, we ordered baklava, and two chicken shawarma plates. As I write this, I feel myself salivating as I envision a steamy hot plate filled with pieces of tender chicken and hummus and pita bread.  I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite places to get chicken shawarma. The lunch rates are reasonable, and when I get my plate, I always opt for a side of fries. The food is filling, and throughout the duration of my friend's stay, we frequented Pita Shack a couple of times. The service is prompt, and the food does not disappoint.  In fact, I am considering going there later on to get my fix.

Flanny's leaves a bitter taste on my tongue.  I have never heard of this place, but after being there, I prefer to experience a momentary lapse of amnesia and forget that this place EVER existed. I am not complaining about the food...my focal point was a couple of drinks, and then partaking in a huge buffet of sorts...but I have a personal vendetta against the service that is offered in Flanny's.  So, picture this: a large table filled with people, sporting their Packers jerseys, some indifferent towards the teams playing in the Superbowl, and one very determined Steeler fan. It is all chaos and nonsense, with people yelling and hooting, drinking, glossy eyed with the mouth watering prospect of their team winning the game. Then, I enter. So, immediately, I decide to order a Long Island and I don't gulp it down, but I nurse on it. And after I finished, I ordered a second one and proceeded to finish that one, as well. The thing is, I didn't completely finish those drinks. But that isn't a matter of importance. Then, a good friend of mine arrives, and since our table is full, we find a small table that is directly adjacent to the table I was previously at, and we order a round of shots. I wasn't buzzed at all. Honestly, I have a high tolerance, and the terminology that was best suited for me was erring on buzzed, but more tired than experiencing any direct effects from the alcohol consumption. Then, I proceed to order the next round of drinks, and the waitress tells me that under the order of her boss, I'm cut. What? I was walking fine, enunciated my words with a crispness that I can't acquire in my sobriety, and I was being cut? Then this witch of a waitress tells me that her boss will come to talk to me, and then explains that, with my stature, the amount of drinks I consumed (1 and a half Long Islands, and a shot of Sex on the Beach) would be impossible for me to handle. I immediately had a dreadful vision of being led away in handcuffs, but after that twinge of fear, I realized that I didn't do anything wrong, and I was pissed. She put a damper on my Superbowl experience. Some of my friends were upset. I was upset. We quickly moved to the Vine, and I can honestly say that what Flanny's lacks, the Vine makes up for it. I even complained to a few people about Flanny's. Revenge is sweet.  Flanny's, you have lost a lot of clientele. It wasn't only my experience, but amongst my crowd of friends, several of them complained about lack of quality service. I was tempted to chew on a piece of bubble gum and leave that as her tip. So, take that!  (I stole this idea from a couple of close yelpers of mine, that bestowed this punishment on a waitress that didn't deserve anything.)  /end rant.
