I didn't die, but I have been to heaven... pizza heaven that is.  The parking on a Friday evening at 7 was hellish.    The decor was nicer than I expected in the dining room, cozy and romantic and there was live music.  The pizza was thick and doughy, more along the lines of a dominos style pizza then a fancy authentic italian pizza.

I went here to get a print mounted. Alan helped me out, I was in and out in 10 minutes and it was very affordable. Alan was nice and very helpful and enthusiastic about what he does.  I will definitely be back and recommending Framin' Works to friends.

I have never been led astray by yelp until now. I wouldn't send anyone I know here, how it has 4.5 stars is baffling!   The decor is probably 20-30 years old, which has its own charms and is passable for a traditional Italian restaurant.   The biggest issue was our waiter Andreas, who looks like Ron Jeremy. He wouldn't take our order without making us ask four times as some sort of poor joke. Then he was shouting across the dining room to check that he had our order correct "did you want the white wine sauce or the marinara?" He would toss silverware on the table in passing and remark "everything okay?" Without waiting for a response or caring. I didn't want to ask for things that we needed for fear of him antagonizing us further.   The second big issue: the food. We started with the mussles in white wine sauce, they were okay. The salad was super plain, one tomato slice, in store bought balsamic dressing. Not even worth eating. I got the penne pasta and it arrived with chunks of wilted romaine lettuce on it. My boyfriend got the veal in Marsala sauce that was flavorless boiled fatty veal.   We each got a glass of wine which was good, on the warm side. Getting a bill for $90 for this extremely sub standard service and food was the final insult to this awful experience.   If you're looking for good Italian food I recommend Tomasos or North.

What a cute place with amaaaazing food and service!  I came her last week for my birthday, its more of a romantic setting that I would recommend to couples for a special night out. Theres a great patio in the back with large trees, shrubs, fountains, and candle lights all around.   All the staff seem to really care about the business and their customers. I felt that the food was worth the price and the overall setting and experience took it to the next level getting the 5 stars!

About a dozen decent beers on the menu. Good for a tasting room but not somewhere I would make a destination for the evening.   I found the prices very reasonable.  They have a slide show of dogs showing on a tv and sports showing on other TVs.   Service was friendly but not particularly fast.   Free popcorn and games if you want to hang out.

Best pedicure I have ever had!!! I was a walk in and they were busy but got me in for a pedi right away. They massaged my calves and feet with lotions and oils for over twenty minutes which was amazing.   They were professional, decently priced, did a great job with my nails. I never want to go anywhere else for a pedi!

Myself and two friends came here to only get terrible service, comically bad. Our appetizer showed up two hours after we ordered it, after we had eaten our meal, and after we had asked to cancel it. And they still charged us for it.   Almost none of the adult beverages on the menu were available.  We all got food poisoning too.   Baffled this place is still open.

I went to this new dance fitness studio near where I work, I haven't ever done dance fitness so was nervous about trying something new, but I had such a great time.   They let me try classes for free which is awesome so I don't have to commit to paying for a membership or paying for classes when I wasn't sure if I would like it or not.   The owner was teaching the first class I took. She was super approachable, friendly, and has great energy. I definitely recommend it and will be back!

Stopped in hair for a hair cut and style and came out happy with my cut, it was 1/2 the price of the salon I had been going to!  Its a nicely decorated place with a laid back atmosphere. The hair dresser didn't try to up-sell me on a bunch of products which was a sooo nice for a change!

Cute place! The owners friendly and plays fun music that he dances to.  It is truly like being in Italy where you feel you are in a family run establishment and the owner is your host for the evening.   I gave it only 4 stars only because the food and beverage list is a bit limited but the service, food, and drink were all great.   Pizza and Bruschetta are the main extent of the menu. They are generous with their portions of prosciutto and other toppings.  Red or White are the only two options on the wine list. I picked the Red which happened to be a Cabernet and it was very good.   Will be back for more authentic Northern Italian Pizza and vino!

Yum! Love this place. A new neighborhood Mexican restaurant with delicious and strong margaritas! I don't think I could walk out of here after more than 2 margaritas. They also have clase azul blanco for under $20 which is my favorite and a good price.  I had the grilled shrimp served with grilled nopales aka cactus, nice flavors and a healthier option compared to some of the more traditional Mexican food around town.   It's family owned and family run which always makes for the best costumer service because they really care about your experience.
