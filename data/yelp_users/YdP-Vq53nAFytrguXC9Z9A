Not a traditional Chinese restaurant. Very cheap but not very good. I've had better food at Panda Express.

A must place to eat if you are here in Vegas. A bit of a drive off the strip but so worth it! My chorizo hash was just spicy enough with great flavor. This plate is so big you can easily split it w someone.  Comes w your choice of egg biscuit and fruit. Sooooo good!!!

Awesome pizza! Can't go wrong w any type of pizza you order. They now have speciality sandwiches, Eeggs, bacon ranch fries and of course the Big Jimmy!   Fast, friendly and good pizza. Dine in or take out and patio seating.

Queen is usually a good place to eat but service and wait time is ridiculous! We ordered about 20 min ago, waiting and still waiting it's now coming up to 45 min wait with no food  I support downtown businesses but they need to have another person in the kitchen or figure out a better system on food delivery. The stars are dwindling away as the wait time grows longer.

Great little sushi place nestled by the lakes. They have a good selection of lunch special. We had the 2 rolls for $8.95 plus the whitetail and snapper nirgri.  The snapper was very buttery and silky.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the chef prepare our sushi. The service is friendly and fast.

So good! First time experience and the food was excellent. Soup was creamy with a hit of spice. The Shepard pie w minced lamb very well done w flaky dough crust sooo good. Plus the gravy wine sauce to top it off excellent! I could drink it, it's so good.

Probably the best burger I've ever eaten! The pork belly buns were succulent an flavorful. The burger was so juicy and the seasoning is spot on for a ban Mai. The fried are excellent and I am so stuffed that I'm going into a food coma now so I think I need to stop typing! A must when you're visiting in Vegas!

Such a good find! This place opened up 5 years ago in the old Better Than Sex Cafe. They have an outside patio area and indoor seating.   I had the 2 egg combo and hubby had the chorizo and egg skillet. Service is quick and friendly. Will definitely come back with the family. It will be a go-to breakfast place for us!

Had the AZ burro and was great! Egg whites w turkey and avocado wrapped in a tomato tortilla. They have a breakfast menu that is also served during lunch. Everything looked affordable.   Will try the soup next time (my gal pal had it for lunch) or the burgers. Vegetarian options are numerous and service was quick.  You do have to bus your own dishes but that's not a problem.   Located right off light rail line in Tempe.

Excellent little breakfast place. A great local hangout but come early to beat the crowd. Service is quick and polite w many friendly faces.   Breakfast menu is all natural ingredients. Haven't tried the lunch menu yet but it all looks good.  You will definitely feel full when leaving!

Such a great place for lunch or dinner! Great empanadas and more! Try the arroz con pollo. They sometimes have soup in the winter time. Located a couple of blocs off the light rail stop in downtown Mesa. A must try if you're looking for good food, fun & a cool place to hang out

Great find in Mekong Plaza. Vietnam sandwiches on freshly baked baguettes. Very fast service and restaurant is bright and clean.  I had the #1 Mekong Special with pork and head cheese. hubby had #3 grilled Beef. Split both and was very satisfying.   The combo includes a drink and you can choose from smoothie or boba ice tea or hot coffee.  Very affordable and good. Will be coming back!

Wow! I'm no expert in Cajun cuisine but this place is great. We got the sampler seafood app and shared the combo plate that came with jambalaya, gumbo and seafood étouffée and homemade coleslaw on the side.  All was great but the étouffée was delish! Creamy with excellent hints of spices and chunks of shrimp, catfish, etc.   We will definitely come back again and try out the rest of the menu.   Staff is friendly and service was fast.

Wow! My family origins are from Taiwan and this brings me back! Great comfort food like ma po tofu and duck. We had the crispy duck with shrimp Lo mien and boy Choy w shiitake mushrooms. Apps are great also - 3 for $6. We had the pig ears, seaweed and kimchi.  Service is friendly and polite and the chef came out to check if the food was good. We went on a Monday night and it wasn't busy.

Wow! So good! Saw this place when we visited the butcher shop next door. Always wanted to try out and not disappointed at all!   Great flavors from pork to beef and chicken. All entries come w rice & soup. There's even this beef soup that I swear tastes like pizza!   The kids loved the food. Totally stuffed and will come back for some more!

Very good Indian food close to home. Had 2 different samosas and both were delish! Orders the Panera tikka pizza (kids are it all) we had the chicken biryani rice. *note this is spicy* I didn't ask for extra spice and it definitely had a kick. We do like spicy food, but if you don't maybe ask for it to be milder.    Also they specialize in pastries - all looked great but we had so much food and no room left for dessert.    I ordered to go and while staff is friendly, it did take about 30 min. before my entire order was out. I'm not complaining bc I know indian food takes a while to prepare, but want to give you the heads up incase you're pressed for time.    We will go back and try some more dishes.  Also, pricing was average. Samosas were around $3-4 that included 2/ea.  The pizza was around $7 and Biryani was $11.  Had the chai too but it was weak. Cost around $1.75
