I have been getting my eyes checked here the last few years and have no complaints whatsoever.  Eye exams are great, Dr. G knows what he's doing. Last week Lynda helped me take advantage of my medical insurance and get some new glasses.  Very consultative, didn't try to up-sell me on what I didn't feel like spending.  The selection of eyewear is great, too.  I highly recommend them.

This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. Our pizza was extremely soggy, so when we asked our waiter for another, he told us we were no longer welcome. Good luck here.

I had to move my dead Vespa from my old house in North Scottsdale to my new house in Central Scottsdale.  Found Phoenix Towing Service based on their reviews on Yelp.  Can't remember who I spoke with on the phone, but he was a great guy.  Immediately dispatched a driver and was at my house in about a half hour.  Bryce put my bike on the truck and towed it to my new place.  Charged me exactly what I was quoted (which was a reasonable price).  Highly recommend this company.  I'll be using them when it's time for me to have it towed to a bike shop.

I've never been much of a breakfast guy because too many carbs in the morning makes me sleep all day.  But let me tell you, THIS is a place to visit.  I came here with my compadres Roland (who also reviewed this place), Jenna and Shaun.  Place is in a very nice shopping center, not too far down the road from Jimmy John's (drool).  Let me start with the food.  Something like Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast.  My mom would kill me if I told her it's better than her Creme Brulee French Toast or her Grand Marnier French Toast, so I just won't say anything.  But it is AMAHHHZING.  I ordered a side of sausage and a side of bacon, and I shouldn't have ordered either.  They were also amahhhzing, but the entree was enough to fill me up.  Needless to say, I took a huge nap afterwards.  Every time I see Jenna and Roland check-in without me on Yelp, they get angry texts from me.  This Wednesday I'm having brunch at Butterfield's on Scottsdale and Shea...I'm told it's same ownership?  We shall see if it compares to the deliciousness that was Butters.

I've been in pain for 3 weeks.  Never had chronic neck pain before, but I didn't think it would go away on its own, so I went to The Joint.  I explained to Dr. Pete the pain I was feeling and he knew exactly what it was.  After a little poking around he found a huge knot in my neck then adjusted it accordingly.  Walked out feeling fantastic.  The pain isn't gone but he said it would take some time, so I'll definitely be back in a week.

BEWARE!  I just got hit with my $39 annual fee that I completely forgot about.  If you can get passed that, then for the love of God, join this gym if you live in the area!   It has everything I need to have a great workout, and nothing more.  A ton of great cardio machines, good amount of free weights, you name it, they got it (except a rower, I'd like for them to get a rower).  Even at peak times it's never very crowded.  Today (Monday) I went n the early afternoon and it was mostly older folk.  After 5pm it's usually young professionals and late night it's high school kids.  High school kids, by the way, all work here.  But they're all nice and they seem to enjoy it there, so no complaints about that.  Equipment is all new, and the employees are constantly wiping everything down.  I'm so happy to have a great gym to go to that's close to my house and has everything I need (and no scene like LA Fitness or Lifetime).  I run here pretty much everyday, workout, then run back home.  Highly recommended.  I only knocked 1 star because I don't like the smell of the soap in the bathroom.
