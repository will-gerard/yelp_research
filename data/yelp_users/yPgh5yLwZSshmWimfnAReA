First off I want to say that I absolutely love Pita Jungle and I've been eating there for almost 10 years. This review is ONLY for this location.   I've been coming to the Arcadia location pretty frequently over the past 6 months and I am extremely unhappy with the service. About a month ago my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. It was a little busy but nothing crazy. Our server took our order and then completely forgot about us. Someone else brought out our food and our server never checked on us even ONCE. I literally had to go track him down to get our check 20 minutes after we finished our meal. And the weirdest part was that he was taking care of all the tables around us... So ridiculous!   Then we ordered take out a couple of weeks ago. We ordered a Mediterranean platter and a hummus and only got ONE pita! It sucks because we didn't realize this until we got home. Another thing is every time I call to place a take out order I'm put on hold for at least 10 minutes then when I go to pick up my food no one is even in the restaurant!   Now what finally sent me over the edge was what happened tonight. I placed a take out order (after I sat on hold forever) for a LARGE hummus and LARGE garlic dip and what we got was ridiculous, there is barely any hummus or garlic dip in the containers. It looks like they took a small hummus and garlic dip and spread them out in a large containers (see attached photos). Then to top it off our pitas were completely cold and gross.   I am so disappointed, I've frequented many of the Pita Jungle's in Phoenix or the years and I've never experienced anything like this. We will definitely not be back to this location!

This location has disappointed me yet again... I ordered a large hummus with 3 wheat pitas to go. I barely got any hummus, it looks like they took a small hummus and put it in a large container, I didn't get the extra pita I paid for and the pitas I did get were white not wheat and ice cold. What a rip off! I definitely won't be back to this location again.

They have awesome vegan breakfast on the weekends, the chilaquiles are delicious! The coffee and desserts are amazing as well... The pumpkin pie Tsoynami is to die for!! I recommend this place to everyone even non vegans!

I have been coming here for lunch over the past few months and I finally decided it was time to write a review. Habanero's is definitely a nice little spot for lunch, it's quick but the food is made fresh. Being a Mexican food fanatic I know good Mexican food and this is definitely it. Everything on the menu is fairly inexpensive but the portions are a good size, I always leave feeling satisfied.   My favorite item on the menu is the blackened fish taco salad, it has everything you could ever want on a taco salad from tasty guacamole to satisfying rice and beans. The blackened fish is absolutely amazing, it's cooked to perfection. I highly recommend anything on the menu that has the blackened fish.   Today I decided to try something a little different. I ordered the a la Mexicana with chicken. It's juicy marinated chicken sautéed with jalapeños and onions, it also comes with a side of rice and beans and warm flour tortillas. I definitely wasn't disappointed. The chicken was flavorful and grilled to perfection. I made tacos out of the chicken, rice and beans and then covered them with the habanero salsa. The habanero salsa gave the tacos a big kick, but it was worth my mouth being on fire for the remainder of my lunch break.  The only reason that I gave Habanero's 4 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of their salsa. I am a salsa connoisseur (you probably didn't know there was such a thing lol), so I am quite critical when it comes to salsa. They have 3 kinds of salsa, verde (mild), red (medium) and habanero (very hot!). All of their salsas are very thin, they have more of a hot sauce consistency. While the salsas do taste good mixed in with your meal they aren't really ideal for chips and salsa but it all depends on what kind of salsa consistency you prefer.   Overall the food is delicious, the staff is very friendly and the service is wonderful! I will definitely become a regular!

I went here last night and got the panang curry, veggie spring rolls and a thai iced tea. Everything was so delicious!!! I got a level 3 on the panang curry and it was pretty spicy but very delicious, so if you don't like spicy make sure to get a 1 or a 2. The sauce that comes with the spring rolls is sweet and spicy and so yummy! I also highly recommend the thai iced tea.  The service was great as well, it's a nice little family owned restaurant.

I was so excited to check this place out, I've had some of their raw truffles and granola from whole foods and they were delicious. Anyway my experience was terrible. When I walked in there was a guy and a girl working... Not friendly at all. I wanted a chai so I asked what kind they used and the girl showed it to me and it looked good so I ordered an iced chai with almond milk. It took them forever to make it even though it wasn't busy. Then the guy gives me a hot chai and I nicely told him that I ordered an iced chai and him and the girl just give me this annoyed look no apology or anything. So he goes to remake it, then the guy gives me this white looking drink that resembled nothing of chai and then tells me he tasted it and it tastes watered down and they usually don't make chai like that and I'm like okay why would you not make it the right way?! He said he used brewed tea and for the iced chai they usually use a concentrate and he could splash some of the concentrate in it... I told him I ordered an iced chai and wanted the concentrate and it made the right way and he's like no I'll just splash some in, so I just gave up and took the drink. When I took the first sip it was absolutely the most disgusting chai I've ever had. So pissed that I wasted $5 on a drink that makes me want to vomit.

This place was just okay. I had the Miso bowl with quinoa, it was good but definitely not worth the $14 I paid for the bowl and an iced tea!   I've read through all the reviews and it looks like there are quite a few people claiming that they don't use 100% organic food, if this is the case then it infuriates me that they have "organic" in their name and are misleading customers! It's wrong on so many levels!   I will just stick with what I can trust and go to the organic salad bar at Whole Foods... I will not be back to Raw!

First off I want to say that I truly wanted to like this place, I always try to support local family owned businesses.   My boyfriend and I had been searching for a good tea room in Phoenix and this place popped up on yelp so we decided to check it out. When we walked in the place was pretty dead but there was a nice ambiance. We met the owner and he showed us the teas we could choose from. My boyfriend and I are very knowledgeable about tea so it only took us a few minutes to realize that they are just reselling Adagio teas as their own. Adagio teas are decent but they are far from high quality tea. Also, anyone can buy Adagio teas not just businesses and it's actually cheaper per ounce to buy the teas directly from Adagio even when not through wholesale.   My next issue was that we wanted to try some tea there. We love tea lattes and were pretty disappointed when we were told the closest thing to a tea latte was adding a disgusting creamer packet to our tea. So we just decided to get a plain hot tea. We both ordered the pu'erh spice which we had both had before from Adagio so we know what it should taste like if prepared properly. Once we got our teas they were way too hot, we couldn't even take a sip for at least 20 minutes and once we did it was one of the worst cups of tea we've ever had. It was so bitter and astringent. To prepare tea properly you need to use the correct temperature water and steep it for the correct amount of time. As a tea room you think they would at least know how to prepare a cup of tea properly.   If you want a good high quality cup of tea this is not the place for you. Very disappointed.

I'm in town visiting and I'm really glad I found this place! It's been very difficult to find a decent tea shop in Phoenix, most of the tea shops I've been to can't even prepare tea properly. I was definitely impressed with Tea2go. They have a good selection of loose leaf teas and while I'm not the biggest fan of flavored teas they still had plenty of options for just straight tea. They can also prepare the teas latte style which I love. I wouldn't say these are the most high quality teas for a true tea connoisseur but if you are looking for a decent cup of tea this is the place. They also have excellent customer service, Jordana (I believe that was her name) was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!

I had the pleasure of working with Ms. Robinson on a legal issue I was dealing with. Ms. Robinson is very knowledgeable in employment law and she was able to provide her expertise to get my issue resolved in a timely manner. I am extremely pleased with my experience and would highly recommend Ms. Robinson. Thank you!
