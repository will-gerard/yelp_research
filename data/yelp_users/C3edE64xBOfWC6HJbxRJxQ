Stayed there once.  It was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in, including that roadside motel in Vermont. The $.99 shrimp cocktail does not make up for a crappy hotel that looks untouched since at least 1960.

Great date place, great place to hang with friends.  A good chance to experience a variety of flavors without stuffing yourself silly.  The food was excellent, across the board.  Good beer selection, but the wine selection was a bit limited, at least by the glass.  We called for a reservation and they said they were booked solid, but if we came over, we could walk in and they would take us.  We arrived to find about 6-8 open tables, and were seated immediately.  Weird.  Firefly is among the better, reasonably priced places I've tried in Vegas.

Went there again, this time with my wife, and confirmed that yes, this is a great place for a date.  My wife is both gluten and dairy free, and was able to find plenty of things she could eat (tip: they will leave out the blue cheese on the stuffed dates). Refreshingly un-Vegas and mostly locals.

$1.75 locally made microbrews, average pizza in the back (Metro). I had the BBQ last trip out and it was good and cheap.  They have a really active karaoke in the evenings, seems like a ton of locals and few tourists.    Besides the cheap good beer, this place is real, and in a city where so much is fake, that's refreshing.

10PM and all the mainstream restaurants are no longer serving.  You hate walking aimlessly through smoky casinos looking for food. So, if you're me, you walk up the strip.  And walk, and walk.   Your food choices include Denny's, McDonalds, Harley-Davidson Cafe. A sign for a new Brazilian-type restaurant shown on the side of the Krave building had me hopeful, but I walked a block in the wrong direction only to find there was no such place.  Arg.  But, it's good to know that if I'm ever looking for boys dressed like girls, Krave is the place to find them...  I digress.  I kept on walking and walking, and ended up at Fatburger.  It was good but the service was crazy slow.  I ate my Kingburger and fries, slurped down my shake, and steeled myself for another long walk back down the strip.

I really wanted to like this place, and I sort of do, but read on.  I walked in with a headache, which usually means I need to eat. I figured a brazilian rodizio type place would be instant gratification with a salad bar and meat leaping off the skewers at all hours.  Not so.  I walked in and was seated, ordered a coke.  I was one of only TWO tables in the whole place.  There were three people working - Yolie in the kitchen, a younger woman at the front, and a guy handling the meat duties (ok, lay off the meat jokes).  10 minutes went by without a sign of my soup or the coke.  The guy came over and said the coke machine was not working, so I ordered iced tea instead.  About 5 minutes later I got my iced tea, and another few minutes went by and I got bread and soup.  Eventually meat made its way over on skewers...slowly.  He asked how I wanted my beef done (well, of course) and it was good.  There was no music playing, just silence, interrupted by the conversation of the other table, and the delightful sound of hammering coming from the ladies bathroom.  Eventually I got tired of waiting for the next round of meat, and I was getting full anyway, so I asked for the check.  It took almost 30 minutes to get me out the door, because the credit card machine wasn't working.  To his credit, the male waiter was very apologetic and even hand wrote a card for 15% off my next meal here.  The food was pretty good - not rock your socks off, but authentic and good.  Based on other reviews, the service seems to be erratic.  I wouldn't bring anyone here you're looking to impress (like a client for example).

Firefly was booked solid, so the team suggested this place instead.  I didn't realize what it was until I got here - the same mediocre Brazilian I tried years ago. Compared to my last visit, service was (slightly) better and the food was worse. It's very much a silver hair crowd, so if you're bringing your hot date here, don't. Given both Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil up the road, there's no reason to come here.

I didn't stay here but popped in for the tail end of a convention.  I was very impressed with how clean the air was inside the casino/lobby (usually these places are super smoky and it wasn't) and the pool/floating river looked awesome.   I saw a lot more families with young kids and strollers here than at other places, so if I had any interest in bringing my kids to Vegas (I don't) I would probably stay here.

Fun place, with a real beer garden and great food.  Open late too.  Beware of the waitresses though, who seem more than happy to try to foist yet another liter upon you, inflating your tab further and further north...

One of the few highlights of the Fremont Street area.  It's like a Wall Street type steakhouse, with friendly staff and good food.    It doesn't rate 4 stars on a national level, but it's head and shoulders above the competition within a 5 mile radius of Fremont St.

As a bar, it's fine, and the "ice" on the bar is pretty cool.  If you're heading here for food, don't.  I'm pretty sure we got food poisioning here, and there were eyelashes in my sandwich. Food quality (when we weren't spewing it back up) was average.

Best pizza in the world?  No. Good enough (and I'm picky about my pizza)?  Yes.  I'm not saying you should walk here from the Strip, but if you're staying at the Hard Rock or nearby, and want to grab a slice, just walk across the street.  Reasonably priced, quick service, nice guy at the counter.  There is pizza next door at some new place that opened but that's a more upscale restaurant-type place.  Tons of taxi drivers, locals, tourists, even a few families were packing the place.  Open late.  Note - they used to deliver to the Hard Rock but are no longer allowed to (a note at the counter for staff says they will be arrested if they come on site.  Seriously?)

If  you're a white trash redneck, enjoy walking around with a bottle of Bud Lite in your hand, and are fascinated by the world's largest cartoon, be sure to visit the Fremont Street experience.  For the rest of the world who has a computer and is reading this, steer clear unless you have to be in that part of town, and are looking for an interesting social experiment.

I was in town on business, walking up the strip with a coworker, and my wife texts and says "you know, if you have time, there's a Betty Page store at the Miracle Mile shops.  Oh, and Yelp says there's a 20% off coupon at the concierge desk." I ran over there and arrived right at 11pm, but the store was already closed.  So, I zoomed over the next day before driving to the airport. The store itself is smaller than the only one I've been in (in Hollywood).   There was a small clearance rack, where I found a cute black skirt. I also grabbed two new collection dresses that I knew she wouldn't have.  There was only one clerk working, but she was helpful in answering my questions.  All told, I was in and out in 20 minutes, including parking.  As in most of Vegas, parking in the garage is free (though there's also valet.)  Good shopping experience and even better, the dresses fit perfectly.

On my last trip out, I was stuck in traffic outside this IHOP.  The signs on the door were promoting fresh strawberry pancakes.  Yum!  I parked, walked in, and waited.  Waited.  Finally someone showed me to a table.  No menus, no coffee, no hello.  I waited.  And waited.  Have you ever said to yourself "if a waitress doesn't show up in the next 3 minutes, I'm walking out?"  Well, I did, and I did.  Sorry IHOP.  You were the bee's knee's when I was 5, but I just have higher standards now.

As detailed in another review, I come to this area for work once in a while, so we're always looking for a good lunch place.  Ambrosia has a little of everything, from soup to sandwiches, pizza, lasagna.  It's a little Mediterranean, a little Italian, etc.  The lunch specials are well priced, service is excellent, and the food has never disappointed.  If you're in the area, give them a try, this place deserves to succeed.

Called for late night delivery to our offices.   Very pleasant on the phone, promised delivery in about 40 minutes. We ordered two pizzas, some entrees and drinks. The food was all pretty good (this from a picky ex-NYer) and delivery came when promised.  They threw in garlic bread and extra salad dressing too.  Entrees seemed like a small container but about halfway through, we were full.  We'd order again from them (and probably will).  One minor nitpick - they forgot utensils, but we found some.

Overhyped, overrated, totally misbilled.   I was told it was "like a cirque show" with comedy.  Wrong in so many ways.  What it is (at least the first 20 minutes of it): - Round circus tent with folding chairs, low ceiling (clue number one that this was not up there with a Cirque show). - A few decent acrobatic acts comparable to what you might see from a traveling Chinese show - 2 different strip tease routines, which can't be called nudity only because there were pasties applied.  Seriously, we're not kidding anyone here.  Nudity was completely out of context, uncalled for, gratuitous. - Lowbrow comedy aiming for the lowest common denominator, with language that would make Tony Soprano and his crew blush.  It's not just a few f bombs, it's literally every other word.  Endless description of sexual acts, in vivid, graphic detail that would make your mother turn red and pass out.  If you enjoy being singled out and stereotyped (the gay guys in the front, we make the black people sit in the back, etc.)  I can't tell you more because we walked out.

Family favorite of all the breakfast places we tried in Scottsdale. We have two gluten-free eaters, so the pancakes here were a welcome surprise, and even the non-gluten people agreed that they were the best we've tasted.  Service was good, coffee was good, prices are fair. If you seek a something for everyone place for breakfast, this is it.

Left two messages during the business day, no callback. Lame. If you're closed for the season, make your message state this.

The best of the rodizio-type places in Vegas, at least that I've tried.  Way better than Texas de Brazil, and light years ahead of Yolies.  Tons and tons of Brazilians working here - if you are an expat and feeling lonely for the sounds of home, come for the conversation alone.  Service was impeccable, food quality was high.  The pudim is indeed excellent, as Marcel says, and while it may not meet his standards for rodizio, again, it's way better than the other options in town.  If you want meat, and lots of it, this is the place.

I often travel to Vegas for business, to do work at our semi-secret data center.  There's not a whole lot of food choices in the vicinity, so we're always on the lookout for something new.  This trip, one of the local guys says "hey, there's a new German place that opened."  So we went to check it out.  We were greeting promptly by (I assume) one of the owners and then a waitress came up, with her ever so slight German accent telegraphing to me that yes, the food will be good.  Sure enough, it was.  A variety of Schnitzel graced our table, and even the West German burger ordered by one of our less adventurous coworkers looked awesome.  At the end of the meal, the chef came around to see how we liked it.  Then the owner told us about their catering menu, including their amazing strudel.  He brought us an end cut sample of strudel, and it was AMAZING.  If you're in Vegas to party, I don't think you'd make the trek out here, but if you're looking for authentic German food, or if you're local and live or work in the area, definitely check this place out.  The only thing I'd add would be some taps with German beer, but I bet that's in their plans.

Ive been here twice, for breakfast.  Service can be a bit slow, and it's weird how there aren't more customers.  $9 got me a pancake the size of a dinner plate (this is a side), plus a large omelete, and a side of fruit.    High quality homecooking.  If you can be patient, you'll like this place.

My sister moved to Scottsdale and just had a baby. I called two other places on yelp with higher ratings, no dice (actually, no one there).  Finally called Enchanted around 330pm and they were not only able to deliver same day, they did it with a product of high quality.   Thanks guys!
