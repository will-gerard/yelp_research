Thought the gyros were damn delicious, and pretty cheap too. Nothing ground breaking, but definitely flavorful. If I still worked over there, it'd definitely be a top lunch spot for me. Nice to find some non-chain places for lunch break.

I actually wrote a review about the Arrowhead location a couple weeks back, and was contacted by management. They offered to make it right and sent me a gift card to come back. My final tab was like $1.02.  With that being said, I had a MUCH better experience here. We tend to joke around with waitstaff a lot, and it's usually a good judge of how the service will be. At Arrowhead, our server was in such a "hurry" that she didn't bother to converse with us. Courtney at this Mesa location was very involved with the three tables in our section and definitely rolled with the punches. She even brought the birthday candle/song over for my wife (as our meal at Arrowhead was initially for her bday).  I left happy and full. Carbonara and the mini meatballs were solid. Much better than my last visit!

Service was slow and fairly apathetic, I'd expect a little better on a Sunday afternoon.  I'd heard plenty about Flo's, mostly good, so I was excited to try it. The salad that came before lunch was cafeteria-grade iceberg. Dressing was tasty, though. My entree was shrimp with bacon, cabbage, and tomato. It tasted okay, nothing special though.  The reason I'm giving them one star, though, is because something in this meal (I'm assuming shrimp) made me sick, and I'm still paying for it two days later. Far from impressed, and I won't be coming back.

Service was slow, food was forgettable. They also seemed to be out of a lot of things on the menu. My burger came out on soggy toast and basically fell apart in my hands, and my wife's "brioche croque" looked like it was on a hamburger bun.   Apparently they think adding an 'e' to the end of words like salad and soup makes them better. I don't know.   Avoid this place for lunch and dinner.

Meh. I'd prefer the freshness of Olive Garden. Staff was so-so, and the chicken parm I got on Papa's Platter was more like a miniature chicken frisbee. I could barely find the chicken, and when I did, it was hard. Overcooked? Or was it just sitting under a heat lamp for so long?  The atmosphere was just kind of dated, nothing special. I felt like I was in my grandma's basement with all the dim windows, boxes, and fake plants.   I wouldn't really recommend this place. I just wasn't impressed.

I know it's a restaurant targeted at large parties, so I'd imagine they'd hire waitstaff that know how to handle larger parties (or at least train 'em to).  Our waitress consistently forgot about portions of our order, like a water for one of our 8 people (though everyone else had a water at that point). The kitchen staff actually brought the limes she requested out before the water arrived, probably 10 minutes after our drink order. The second pitcher of beer we ordered after appetizers didn't arrive until after we were finished with the dinner portion. I could go on, but you get the point.  Service was really slow, and it was hot and musty in our section. For a party of 8, 2 hours on a Sunday evening is pretty rough. The kitchen wasn't behind, we just sat with empty plates for a good 30-45 minutes after our meal.  Good food ruined by the lack of service. Too bad.

Could be the waitress I've had the last two times I've been here, but my general feeling is that this place is rarely worth the money. We went for dinner after a Spring Training game and our waitress had difficulty splitting a bill in half (she hand wrote the totals on the original receipts..?). Service was slow but it was late and we had drinks and a group so it wasn't an issue so much. Food was meh.  Then I go in for lunch today, same waitress. I think "oh great, this should be an adventure" -- boy was I right. Took over an hour for 2 lunch portions and an appetizer for our table. Nothing complex, either (2 fish and chips and a baked artichoke). It seemed that the waitress had no concept of time -- likely because she was standing at the bar just inside talking to her coworkers while we burned up on the patio waiting for food. She also failed to bring out condiments we asked for -- I would have reminded her, but the next time we saw her, she was bringing the checks.  I may not have cared so much if I wasn't on a lunch break, but when it's business lunch hour, you'd think the waitstaff would try to acknowledge that. $20 for lunch with slow service and average food is never worth it.  Honestly don't think I'll be returning unless it's for cheesecake to go, which seems to be the only considerate service in the place.

I interacted with this business via email, phone, and in person. All interactions were great, and very helpful for this DIY landscaper. The prices were great, paid  $13 for a ton of fill dirt, and $160 for 2.5 tons of 1" rock that was really unique looking. Delivery was affordable, too. Driver dumped the rock right where we asked.   Couldn't ask for a better experience from something I wouldn't usually search for on Yelp -- glad I did!

I would highly recommend TCW to any of my friends or family looking for window coverings. James and Kelli make a great team. Kelli was super responsive when I had questions, and James knew more than I could've ever thought to ask about our window coverings.  I requested quotes from about 5 different vendors, and at the end of the day, I chose them because of how helpful and friendly they were. So many of the places I talked with made it feel like my order was just job number X. Kelli got me a fairly complicated quote (we had some odd window sizes and special requests for a few windows) within the hour, and James worked with us on payment as we were closing on our first house while he had to place the order. He and his son covered the windows in our house in under an hour, if I had to guess. Super efficient install. I even joked with him about wanting to get some better bulbs in our stairwell chandelier (I'm super afraid of heights), and he volunteered to put them in for me while he was putting blinds up in that area. Little things like that tell me I chose the right team.  Their pricing was competitive, and the quality of the product is great. But at the end of the day, I wanted to work with great people that are passionate about their product and customer experience -- and that's why I chose The Covered Window for our house!

I honestly don't get it. I know customer service is a part of their marketing, so I assume it's a part of their company culture (or at least that the management makes it a priority). This store, though? Woof.   I was just walking across the front of the store to get to the entrance, and some guy walks out to join his other buddies (all in uniform), making some smart ass comment about how "no one works around here." I had to stop in my tracks so he wouldn't run into me. Like, really? I don't care if you're on break, you're a representative of the company. Think about it.   During my in-store experience, zero associates asked if I needed help, even though I was pretty lost (side note, the app does NOT match the item locations in store at all). I can only assume they were outside shootin' the shit.  100% of the time, go to the Lowes in North Peoria. They're in another league.

Full disclosure: I cancelled my appointment before even receiving any services here. My wife had a morning appointment, and I had one in the afternoon. After hearing her experience, I cancelled my appointment.   She went in for an initial appointment, which included waiting in the lobby for an extended amount of time (concerning as she was the only one waiting when she got there). She had X-rays done, the dentist came over and reviewed them, and said that she was good to go schedule her cleaning.   Now, in a time where people are generally not able to shell out extra funds for things that are routinely covered by a major dental insurer, I found the following alarming. The initial visit was 100% covered, but the cleaning she was to schedule would be over $100 because they do some "special gum cleaning." No alternatives were offered, and no real explanation for the cost.  I called and cancelled my appointment (receptionist was very unprofessional), and we won't be going back. In the limited interaction we've had with this place, it's very clear that they're focused on money and not the patient -- it's the only reason I can think of for charging that much for a cleaning (I've had fillings that cost less!), and making you schedule multiple appointments to get established. How is that helpful or friendly?

Delicious. Great selection, and everything was very fresh. Solid cocktail menu with dinner, and the Chicken Grandmere / Sea Scallops we ordered were plenty and very flavorful. Warm chocolate tart for dinner, and we had a delicious dinner/dessert/drinks for under $100. Not a bad deal if you ask me.  Side note- Sean was a great waiter. Very friendly, and he was extremely knowledgeable with the menu. Always refreshing to have that experience, seems to be a dying art form in restaurants today.

I was hardly impressed, especially for a $20 a person weekday breakfast buffet. Showed up and had to wait in line, and then another line after paying. Service could've been more friendly. When we were seated, our drink orders were taken. Milk was closer to warm than cold. Since the buffet is huge, my wife and I decided to walk around and preview what was available. I pretty much immediately regretted spending $40 on what was sure to be a sub par breakfast.  Half the food I took was under temperature, and a lot of what was available looked VERY old. For a 9:30 breakfast in Vegas, this seems a little disturbing.  They started bringing out cupcakes before we left, and some were pretty good. But honestly, nowhere near good enough to ever bring us back. If you're hanging on to "Best Buffet in Vegas" from like 5 years ago, I think it's time to refresh. I can't imagine paying for a dinner here-- there's no way it can be that much better.

This place has a bit of a nostalgic feel to it for me, with grandparents coming from Central Europe -- from the food to the decor, it feels like going to grandma's house. Love it.  All the sausages I've had here have been great. Excellent beer selection, as well! Don't forget to start with the pretzel, too.  Kinda bummed that they're on a limited menu right now (have been since January apparently?), because the cabbage roll is the best thing on their menu. Hopefully it comes back soon!

Was expecting way better for some reason. I'd never been, but heard the name several times, so we stopped in for dinner tonight.   Cleanliness didn't seem to be of high importance in the little I saw of the restaurant. Smelled a little like cleaners inside the door, so that was off putting. My glass was sticky and the table was stained, it just felt like a low-end chain experience.   Food was okay - pollo fundido was marginal. I've had better before, but it's hard to mess up. It was lacking quite a bit of flavor, though. One person in my party found aluminum foil in her food, to which the server responded that it was a "hard, dry basil leaf." Right.   Probably won't come back here again unless I'm on this corner and want Mexican food. Pretty unspectacular - I can get dinner that's more flavorful at a hole in the wall place for half the price.

Hands down the best service in the area. While Dutch Bros is friendly, but not always accurate and/or professional. This CBTL location is great -- always friendly, consistently good drinks, and pricing on par with competition. They really shine come winter, though. The toffee nut latte has become a seasonal ritual for me. Forget PSLs and peppermint mochas.

Excellent service, great rooms and room amenities. A little off the beaten path, but its perfect for a person who's not a huge partier -- and not a fan of casino smoke/noise. Right across the street from the mall, which is nice, and shuttles to the Wynn and the Forum Shops at Caesar's. That just seals the deal for me.  Half the price of Planet Hollywood for a Saturday night. And believe me, not even a close comparison.

Disappointment from the minute we arrived. Got here 20 minutes before check in on a Sunday afternoon, and were told to wait until exactly 3 to avoid being charged $15 for an early check in fee. I mean, really? Were they cleaning our room right at that moment? When we finally got upstairs to our room, hardly what I had expected based on the rest of the casino/facilities.  Carpets look beat to hell, air freshener covering up smoke smell all over the place in non-smoking areas, dark hallways, dusty ledges, dirty grout... it just gets to be a bit much, especially when you THOUGHT this was a nice place. No fridges in the rooms, that's an extra charge (which seems to be the recurring theme here). Buffet was nasty. Miracle Mile is about the only redeeming quality, really.  $14 per device per room per day for WiFi. Welcome to 2005.

Came for cigars/drinks on the back patio. Service was top notch, and by God were the mixed drinks tasty. Not your traditional mixed drinks, either. Was very impressed with what I ordered (shim sham). Would come back for a nightcap again.  Side note: the host was a little odd, noticed that mentioned in a few reviews. He had us sit and wait to be taken back to an empty patio? Oh well, minor inconvenience.

Food is usually subpar, and I don't think I've ever had prompt service here. I mean, it's a bar, so I don't expect much. But when your first round is finished by the time the waitress brings out the chips and salsa you ordered with it... Well.   Side note: Salty's is a horrible neighbor. So many late night noise complaints from the music (sometimes on weeknights). But who am I kidding, who doesn't love dubstep at midnight on a Thursday?

Drool.  This place offers up some damn decadent options for ice cream lovers. I went with the S'mores and my wife got the Toffee Banofi, and we couldn't decide which was more delicious. I'll definitely be back here next time we're in the neighborhood.   Sharing a sundae is totally doable, they are huge. Not saying you'll want to share, though :)

Delicious. Steak melts in your mouth, and the mahi mahi I got was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend the Flemings potatoes, as well. Overall, everything tasted fresh and was well seasoned. Waitstaff was very knowledgable, which I always appreciate.   Good service, make sure you tell them if it's a special occasion as well -- we got some truffles as a gift for our anniversary. Highly recommend!

Gah, so tasty. Bummed they were out of the bangers and mash pasty, but my second choice was damn tasty -- the table ordered Royale with Cheese, Pilgrim, Peppered Steak, and the Portobello Chicken, and everyone was more than satisfied. $9 average for the entrees was well worth it.   Also, the chocolate chip cake was amazing. Dense after the meal, no doubt. But if you're sticking around to chat, you can definitely find room ;)  Solid beer selection, too.

Used to love this place, but I feel like it's slipping slowly into a comfort zone that favors laziness. The last three times we've gone, it's been a disappointment. I'm big on customer service, and it's seriously lacking here.  The first time, the two cashiers couldn't be bothered to look up from their cell phones while checking us out. I'm not kidding -- the cashier looked at me to take my card, and that was it. Her coworker sat on the half wall/counter next to her, buried in her phone the whole time.  The second time, they closed an hour and a half early on Saturday night for "cleaning". Part of me thinks that's code for "we're bored and want to go home early so we're getting a head start." Had I not had the first experience prior to this, I might think otherwise, but the staff is always so aloof and distracted that I have a hard time buying in to it.  Then, last night, I wanted some FroYo, so we headed over to AZ YO CO to see if we could get in before they closed before their posted hours again. We arrived at 8pm to the overwhelming smell of cleaner (bleach and lysol maybe?). All the machines were pulled back, so we had to reach in to the cutouts to dispense the yogurt. It felt like we were inconveniencing the girl that had been cleaning by using the machines. When we got to the counter, several toppings were missing or not refilled. The cashier didn't say much to us again, and we left. In the 2 minute drive home, my FroYo turned to basically soup.  To be honest, I've got problems with three things here: the staff is usually unprofessional (through no real fault of their own, I think that's on management to put systems in place and not rely on a 16 year old to run a store autonomously), they have slowly been cutting back on flavors (felt like half the machines were unused last night), and the temperature/consistency of the yogurt is way too runny. I also found their pricing to be really high -- we paid $11 for a couple of half-full cups last night. More than I remember paying in the past...  I'll drive the extra couple of miles and go to Yogurtology at 67th and the 101 next time. Bummer, but it seems like ownership just doesn't really care anymore.

Full disclosure: I wound up doing the yard myself, but I wanted to commend Ivan's speediness and transparency when we were looking for options. He provided us with an a la carte quote after meeting us. We wound up DIYing it to save money, but his quote was more than competitive. Nice guy, and I've already recommended a few people to him!

Now that I can breathe...  Look, I love bagels. I love breakfast. They delivered on this front, and earned that 1 star. I unfortunately also appreciate customer service and cleanliness. When you fail to deliver on that, I don't care how good the food was.   The guy taking orders (I'm assuming he was the manager based on age) was great. Always friendly when I'm in there. I got to the payment register and found myself in the middle of a flirting session between the cashier and another worker. Since I disturbed their chat, they were quick to jump back in. Had to butt in again to ask for my drinks -- based on her reaction, I probably should've apologized for asking for what I paid for. My bad.   Some time later, I noticed an extreme amount of smoke filling the restaurant. A dense haze filled the air and I had to step outside so I could breathe. I noticed a girl monitoring the toaster -- I saw flames inside it and she BLEW into the toaster to put the fire out. Shortly after, a large plume of smoke came out of the toaster. Sweet, found the source (and a health code violation).   A worker came out and propped the door open with a rock from the side of the curb to get rid of the smoke. He returned to work with the same gloves on that he had picked up the rock and doormat with.  I'll be heading elsewhere for bagels from now on out. Obviously little care is paid to experience and food safety here.   Side note: my catering order earlier this week was 30 minutes late as well. It's not like we're making complex dishes here, so what gives?

It's Paradise Bakery, so you know what you're getting. Pretty good food, at a decent price. Salads are always great, and you can't beat the cookies. And the atmosphere is pretty solid for lunch meetings, dinner with someone, etc. Very casual, but not overly so.  One gripe I have about this location: service times always seem slower here. Like there's people trying to stay busy doing other things and not exactly expediting the process of moving customers through the line. There are definitely some great people working here, but for example, the other night I waited almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a half for a to go order. Not worth that kind of wait while my soup is cooling off, you know?

Pretty nice little place that's kind of hidden in a strip mall. I thought the service was exceptional, and the food was pretty damn tasty. The menu was pretty interesting, I actually had a hard time settling on what to order (which is rare for me). Everything sounded tasty.  The green chile mac was the star of my dish, but the roasted chicken was moist and well seasoned as well. And OMG on the chocolate bread pudding. I'll be craving that in a few days.

The only place I'll go to wash my car from now on. Love that there's FREE vacuums and compressed air -- very easy to clean my entire car with just those two tools. Customer service is always great and the pricing is competitive (I usually go with the $10 wash). I'd much prefer to do the drying and interior myself anyway, as the people at other local places that do it for you are usually less-than-thorough.

Delish. I love that their menu is unique but familiar, so I'm always open to running with something that's a little out there. This time was the brewlee -- a burger that had some pickled veggies, sriracha mayo, a fried egg, and caramelized sugar on the bun. Cooked perfectly and damned tasty. Service was friendly and available but not overbearing, which I always appreciate.   PS - house made pop tarts intrigued me, but mango covered in caramel is hardly "seasonal" in December. I'll have to wait til next time to try one (hopefully with a better flavors ;) )

Dutch Bros is my go to for any kind of coffee drink. Prefer the smoothness of their coffee over Starbucks any day. I actually have a hard time drinking anything from there now, because it just tastes burnt ( AND Dutch Bros' espresso seems to have more of a kick).  Customer service is always top notch, so glad to finally have a location on the west side!

Solid choice when you want something specific (the have so many choices it's ridiculous), and quick. You can place your order online, and by the time you get there, it's probably going to be ready. Very nice if you have a short window for breaks, or are in a crunch for time.  I docked a star though, because I feel like the protein portions are usually lacking. Doubling your meat on the sandwich is definitely worth it.  If there's one reason I keep coming back though, it's the banana chocolate shakes. Holy crap.

Solid burgers and fries, and holy crap do they give you a lot. The cup they serve fries in is more like a suggestion, as they fill the bottom half of the bag with fries anyway. Why waste money on cups? Cajun fries are the bomb, especially if you like a little spice. The jalapenos here are pretty kickin' too.  Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the price. I'd be here more often if it wasn't $10-$15 for one person. IMO a bit too high for what I'd consider a lunch spot, but you do get what you pay for, especially in this case.

Pretty darn tasty breakfast items in an area that really doesn't have much to offer as it's stuck between the Arrowhead and Lake Pleasant town centers.  Coffee offerings are pretty marginal in my opinion, I've had some good black coffee there, and I've had one that was awful. Seems hit-or-miss in that regard. Breakfast sandwiches are great with those homemade croissants, though -- and at $3.99 for that plus a coffee, I could even stomach Folgers or something like that.  Only reason I'm forgoing a fifth star would be the service. Every now and then, you can definitely tell that this place is mostly staffed by young people with limited customer service experience. I've only had one not-so-great experience (cashier took my drink order and then walked away and never brought me what I ordered), but it does seem a little scattered every now and then.   Overall though, this is where I go for donuts when I want something fresh and tasty. Two thumbs up!

Great place for catching up or for a quick informal meeting. Used to be a Jack in the Box, so the drive thru and interior are well laid out, much better than a typically-crowded Starbucks.   I will say, though, this is the only one I've been to that has on multiple occasions added cream and/or sweetener to my iced americano without asking. Kinda weird, but maybe it's just random chance. Some of us CAN handle black coffee

I ordered the Southern Hospitality. I also received no hospitality.   Food was damn tasty, but the service was atrocious. 4 people, didnt come during peak time. Had to find a manager to have someone come take our order after sitting there for 10 minutes without a peep from anyone. She came and took our order, then stumbled through the rest of the transaction. The food saved the visit, but it sounds like the way to go is to order takeout and go eat it in the Pavillion area nearby.

Slow service, only decent coffee.   Look, I get its not Dutch Bros, but when you're trying to copy them so obviously (I mean, come on with the branding and collateral... it's a direct copy), you have to fulfill the baselines and do something different to differentiate yourself. Dutch kills it with their customer service -- fast, friendly, and generally focused on creating a great customer story.   At Desert Eagle, we waited for 10 minutes behind one car, and then attempted to order. Too fast for POS system, apparently, as the barista was attempting to swipe through all the menu options on his tablet to find my americano order. The tablet concept, while neat in theory, slows down the ordering process and honestly feels like a GM's idea of an inventory management system without considering the personal connection between customer and employee.  He had to make my small black coffee twice (asked for iced and he gave me hot), and after 20 minutes in line... I was kinda over it.   If you wanna copy Dutch, copy their service model, not their menu. There's a reason they're successful.

Super fun place for a night cap after enjoying a bite at one of the fine establishments around the neighborhood. They recently started charging for games, not a big deal and honestly it kept the machines more open from the first time I was there. People tend to move around a bit more.  Only two knocks: the back section is hot as HELL every time I'm there. Second, the bartender didn't know what Ballast Point seasonal was on tap when I asked -- she came back with the beer, still didn't know. I asked again, she said she'd check, and never came back. Definitely wasn't a lager like she said, either. Just a minor ding on service.

Finally, a locally owned gastropub-type restaurant for us in the West Valley. They've got a unique menu, and it's apparently owned by the chefs. I always feel good about a place that's food-first.  Two things keep me from giving them 5 stars: the service was SLOW at our last visit, and the prices are kinda high for some of the things you get. Take the fish tacos, for instance. Clearly frozen fish, but I'm paying the price it's be if it was ocean-caught that morning. That kind of stuff will work itself out the longer they're open, though.

Fresh, imported ingredients... amazing flavor profiles and even better service. The vibrance of the owners is reflected in the decor, and it has translated to the staff as well. Perfect place for a romantic dinner or a chill happy hour. Tons of unique wine, beer and cocktails to choose from!
