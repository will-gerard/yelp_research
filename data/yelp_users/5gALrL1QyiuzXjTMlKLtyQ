Fresh ingredients, no lard, no freezers, no MSG. Clean store with an enthusiastic staff. Calorie counts on menu boards detours me from eating more fresh fair.  Great inviting energy from Store Manager Rami.   There seems to be a lot of regulars here. We will definitely come back.

The manager of this establishment has in inability to handle complaints, maintenance issues regarding the coffee machine, and counting money correctly. This is the 4th time I have had issues with my coffee order, 1st time: they just forgot to make it; 2nd time made incorrectly: 3rd time the wrong drink was made all together.... And this time: no coffee added to the order. The same manager handled the situation each time not in a timely manner whats so ever.

Best pizza in AZ! Coal baked pizza has the perfect crust. Sauce to die for. Gramaldis is reminiscent of being back east.

There are things that Mini of Tempe needs to learn about consumer service.  Today I dropped off my Mini Cooper S for a scheduled recall maintenance appointment.  I was given an Avis rental Honda Civic instead of the Mini Loaner car I was accustom to.  My service repressive (who I love on most occasions), called to say my car was ready, I grabbed my daughter and headed that way, only stopping to refill the gas tank of the rental.   When I arrived at Mini of Tempe, the service department was closed.  I was told by a sales associate that I would have to come back tomorrow (which in my case was not possible, I would have to wait until next Monday, which was unacceptable).  That's when I asked to speak to someone else, which ended up being the more ignorant unprofessional Sales Manager, John, who again told me it was impossible to get my car back.  Apparently, just having a car was enough for John and it was okay for me to have to drive another 45 minutes back home without my car only to not have my car for another week.  I think not.  You see John, I believe that you are wrong when you said, "It's not my job."  John, you are a representative of Mini and of Mini of Tempe.  You are the Sales Manager.  I realize that you are not my service Manager, which means that you are not in service.  However, Sales... which brings me to why I bought a Mini.  I bought a Mini because of the service, repetition, and product.  I did not buy the Mini because of Dave's (my Salesman, who too has always been great) sales pitch, I bought the Mini because every time I bring in my car for service it would be washed, every time my Mini needs service I would have a loaner Mini to drive, German engineering, hassle free car.    So John, please remember the sale does not stop with the sale, it is what happens after the sale is why you have the sale to begin with.  Remember, as a Representative of Mini, it is your job.  As great as Dave was when I bought the car, my brother sold me on Mini, and it was when Dave and Sergio introduced me to Doug that closed it for me.
