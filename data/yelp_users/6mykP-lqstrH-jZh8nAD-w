I am so grateful for this hospital.  My little dog, Gizmo, has had a few emergencies...all which have been in the middle of the night.  I rushed him in each time, and they gave him the utmost care, the quality I would expect for a family member!  The emergency vets at night are so great, everyone is kind and caring, they are upfront about costs and I never have felt overcharged or had unnecessary treatments pushed onto me.  Last night Gizmo got a bite in the eye from my other dog, I rushed him in and they took excellent care of him for a more than reasonable price.  He is doing so much better now and I am so grateful.

If you have a small or exotic pet, this is the best doctor you can find.  I am so glad I found Dr Driggers for my chinchilla, Mini.  He was so ill, and I didn't even realize how sick he was.  Dr Driggers discovered an unexpected problem and corrected it and Mini is now doing better than he's been in months. Such a kind, caring vet and so reasonably priced for such a detailed level of care. Thank you all so much!!

The food is amazing. Incredible. Unique. I adore the food, and as another has said, roasted almond tortellini is my favorite.  Atmosphere is cute and what you'd expect from a privately owned restaurant.  -1 for the seats being quite uncomfy.   Service is usually great. Mind you, I'm not very picky with service. Just bring my food, fill my drinks occasionally and I'm pleased.  This wasn't the case the last time I went. I took my mother-in-law... And I was actually embarrassed by this waitress. She was rude, didn't offer us the entire options "a salad with feta dressing, k?!", and then when my mother in law asked her what desert she would recommend (seriously, make up something If your not sure) she replied with "you know what, I'm busy!". My jaw dropped. She followed this with "I have a table of 12 and I'm the only one here, but everything is good enough."  I have never been treated like waiting on me in a restaurant was an inconvenience.   Romeo should be upset as I was, because this kind of service put a bad taste to the amazing food.   I left 4 stars because my service in the past had never been so bad, and I am a regular who loves the dishes.

I love coming here for one reason--Michelle.  By far the best service I've had and I am definitely a nail junkie whose been to many, many nail spas. She treats you as if your the only person in the salon, takes her time to ensure the service is perfect, and meets all requests with ease.  I truly enjoy going to her.   The salon is very clean and beautiful.  Other nail techs I've been to there have rushed me, or my friends, and done sloppy fast work.  I only go to Michelle but you will not be disappointed with her!  She works Thursday thru Sunday and you can make an appointment ahead of time :)

I was SO glad a friend referred me to Dr. M and I now have my whole family seeing him. Here are a few of many reasons.  1- When first saw Dr. M, I was seeking a diagnosis for what I now know is a very rare autoimmune disease of the mouth. I had seen 9 physicians and 3 dentists and each turned me away as making a diagnosis was too difficult and obviously not fast money. Dr. M was the ONLY one who sat down with me and went through a differential, educated me on the possibilities, answered all of my questions and had me referred for a biopsy which lead to diagnosis and treatment.   It took 2 years to find someone who cared enough to spend a few minutes actually trying to help me, and Dr M was that person.  2- Since my initial experience, Dr. M has treated all my dental issues and I have had excellent results without any discomfort. What I find most unique is that he truly recommends the best treatment plan and not simply the most expensive. When I first saw him I was under the impression from a previous dentist that I needed 3 root canals. Dr M filled all the teeth with basic fillings and I have not had any problems since. I'm so glad I didn't go through all that suffering for nothing! It's HARD to find a dentist that doesn't second as a skilled salesman. Dr M takes his time, is extremely thorough and really takes an interest in his patients. Dr M is actually a "doctor" in the true sense of the word.     3- He does the cleanings himself.  His receptionist told me that he has a hard time trusting the work to someone else. What other dentist cares that much? To think that most dentists do their exam in 5 minutes or so...it is so much more thorough of an exam this way.   4-The staff that works with Dr M is incredible. They remember me individually and I have such a good time catching up with them each time... It's like meeting up with old friends!  They do a great job and also take their time.   5- The office has every little comfort in mind. There is a beautiful fish tank in front of each station which is calming and pleasant.  There is a TV attached to the light which you can watch while they work. The chairs are super comfy and the entire place is beautiful and cozy.   Thank you for everything Dr Mazaheri!

Scam!!!  Signed up due to the great specials, well not so great!!   They get you to sign a contract, but then use severely low treatment settings on their laser so the results are slow as possible to ensure you need more treatments.  After 6 treatments I had no reduction. I took a picture of my setting and showed another less tech, she said I am on the completely wrong settings for my skin and it would be impossible to have results at these settings!!  So I am now in a contract for 89$ a month with no way out. I still get laser done, but at laser for less in chandler, there is no point wasting precious time on ineffective treatments.  I just wish I wasn't forking over money to them each month. Please save yourself!

I have been going to Emilio since moving to Gilbert and I adore him.  He is sweet, fun, entertaining and has wonderful ideas and I never leave with my hair short of perfect.    I watch the other ladies do hair as I get mine done and everyone who leaves the Salon looks incredible.  I doubt you could go wrong here.    Tip: sign up for the aveda rewards program and you get points from purchasing products, every so many points you get 75 off a salon service.  Huge money saver.

Changed owners, new owners are not customer service oriented.  I continued to be billed for 3 months after cancelling my membership then sent to collections  (impacting my credit). When I reached out to tell them that I had been billed for time that I was no longer a memeber, they told me to take it up with the billing company.  Unacceptable
