With fresh baked breads, crisp veggies, amazing sandwich creations, and some of the best cookies in town. Paradise is one of my regular lunch spots. Often two to three times a week!

The chicken ciabatta sandwich is out of this world. Great service and many delicious menu items makes Charlestons one of my regular lunch destinations

Slower than desired service the last two visits. Food is decent. Flat iron steak sauce was very salty.

I'm rewriting this review because of the excellent customer service following my 2 star review from February. I was immediately contacted by someone from The Keg after my review asking if I would like to provide more detail. I was happy to oblige. After that I spoke to Dave Campbell, Operations Director. He was apologetic and even let me know they had recently made changes to the restaurant and hoped I would give them another chance.   Long story short, my wife and I went back for her birthday last night. It was a great meal. My filet mignon was cooked to perfection. The dessert was spectacular and the service was great.   I wish all restaurants took customer service and satisfaction as seriously as The Keg does. I'm a fan!

I called to order a calzone or calzone style sub and encountered one of the worst customer service experiences of my life.  Though I am sure Kaylin knew what I was trying to order (a pizza calzone special, I was looking at an older menu) she repeatedly acted confused and was rude and indignant.  I have been a longtime customer of this location and that is in serious jeopardy after this experience.  I was put on hold repeatedly, the total call was 7 1/2 minutes and I never ordered due to this treatment.  After the first hold I asked if I could talk to a manager as I thought the employee was new and was not understanding my order.  She informed me she was the only one there, no manager.  After the second or third hold (all the while I was trying to explain I wanted the calzone with pepperoni, ham, peppers, onions, sauce and cheese) I asked her about the manager again, she again responded there was no manager.  I had to ask if there was EVER a manager in the store and what his name was.  She finally told me it was Jose.  The message above is what I sent to Hungry Howies corporate headquarters and I requested that they contact me regarding the issue (it's an option on their complaint form).  That was four weeks ago and I haven't heard from them at all.  Clearly the company does not care about customer service.
