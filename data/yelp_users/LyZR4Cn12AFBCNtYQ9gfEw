One of our family's favorite places! Consistently great service, recent functional expansion to get carry-out orders out of the way of dine-in guests. Bartender (i think Vicki) is fantastic, kiltlifter on tap, Wednesdays 1/2 priced wine bottles, good portions on salads, great pizza options and attentive staff. Despite the various locations in the phoenix valley, we could really use one further west =)

This is our local spot for breakfast or brunch. They also do lunch items but we haven't really tried that yet. Have never had a problem parking, there is an outside patio but if you go during the weekday there are often smokers out there so we stay inside. The service is consistently top notch and the staff exhibits great team work. We usually order one of the specials, my favorites are "the city" and the monte cristo sandwich. My friend got the steak and eggs on sunday and was happy with it. The coffee was great and always full!  The only downside is the checks/ bill have to be taken to the pay station by the entrance and if it's a weekend crowd, the area gets kinda tight. NOT a big deal but it's a factual situation and some people aren't so patient.

Terribly slow, always. At least they are consistent!

I'm not into this stuff at all but have been here 3 times!  Really like this place and take visitors for a treat when they are in town. Decent color choice, clean environment, friendly staff and I've never had to wait too long.   Wish the waxing (eyebrows, underarms my only experience here) was more private, in my experience people coming in and out of room or cracking open the door to talk.... not into it.  Also, they have a loyalty points card which is nice if you frequent such a service.

I've only been here twice but - so far so good. 1) good location, I can walk there, the parking isn't stressful if you arrive by car, NW corner of 75/cactus. 2) the server was quick, attentive and seemed really appreciative to have us as customers. Always nice to feel valued as a customer! 3) the pho - delicious, filling!  I'll add more when we go back, we will be back!

Can one employee bring an establishment to a 1 star rating? Yes! "Jeff" is consistently there and so service is constantly poor. It seems as if he is super irritable every time we are in there. Passes judgement when his suggestions (of helpful options with shipping/ price) aren't taken. Also I notice his coworker is more "by the book" with asking the normal questions about a package. Jeff sometimes doesn't talk at all and makes things awkward.

We found out about these guys via yelp actually. They were available fairly last minute, came on time, got the job done quickly, made professional suggestions and we would 100% use them again should we be in the market for plumbing service.
