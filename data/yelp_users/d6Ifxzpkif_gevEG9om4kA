Okay, let's get one thing straight right off the bat. the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the employees are really nice, the general store is really cute, and overall, it has a very cozy, comfy, Litt-House-on-the-Prairie vibe going on.  One star is too much for the food they are serving. The grits were just a bowl of flavorless mush. No salt, no pepper, no butter. Nothing. Just flavorless slop.  The same goes for the gravy. Lukewarm, under seasoned, and clumpy.  The biscuits were okay. Too small and not enough butter for my taste, but they were the best part of the meal by far.  The sausage patties were tiny, tough, and I can swear they came out of a Jimmy Dean microwavable sausage packet.  The sausage patty in a McDonald's sausage McMuffin with egg is 10 times better.  Did I say 10 times? I meant a hundred!!  The menu says their bacon is apple-cured-and-smoked, fancy-schmancy, peppered something-or-other bacon. I must have ordered the Ralphs-plain-wrap bacon because what I got was three (small) slices of your everyday, standard, garden variety, regular ol' bacon.  The board in the country store says they sell loaves of fresh sourdough bread.  I ordered sourdough toast with my meal.  I'm almost certain it's the same sourdough bread I have in my pantry at home that I bought at the grocery store. Not sure why they wouldn't serve their fresh sourdough bread with breakfast.  Apparently, they have some kind of special flavored butter that they only serve upon request.  LAME!  What if it's your first time there and you don't know you're supposed to request it?  If a restaurant has an item that they are proud of and sets them apart from other restaurants, they should offer it up for free all day long so people come back for it!   P.S. - I'm pretty sure I did request the special butter, it just never arrived.  Oh yeah, and what is with having to get up and go to the cashier to pay? Why can't we just pay the waitress? There are tons of them all over the place!!!  If you are visiting from out of town, it is a cool place to check out on your way out of Dodge. But, if you're looking for breakfast, look about 50 yards east and you'll see Denny's.  "Moons Over My Hammy" baby!!!!

What a cool place.  If you're a sports fan, but still enjoy a relaxed, casual setting without all the noise, and craziness of a typical sports bar, this is the place to go.  Sports memorabilia everywhere.  Over 900 autographed, and glass encased baseballs, line the walls.  Jerseys, bats, pictures, banners, and pennants all over the place.  Now, Laura, the awesome waitress who waited on us Friday night, told me this is a "San Francisco Giants" bar/restaurant.  My first reaction, being from Los Angeles and a huge Dodgers fan, was to high-tail it outta there!  But, I got over it and enjoyed our wonderful food.  We shared the fried onion appetizer (check in on yelp and they're free!!).  Real tasty...and huge! (kinda like me hahaha).  Crispy, hot, and seasoned really nicely.  My wife had the ribs with au-gratin potatoes and mayo-based coleslaw (which she said was the best coleslaw she's ever had.  She seemed to really enjoy her meal.  I had the chicken breast smothered in spinach and mushrooms with a very tasty herb-garlic butter sauce.  I didn't care for my coleslaw though.  I chose the vinegar-based slaw.  Over all it was a great dining experience.  We even ran into an old friend.  P.S. - Try to sit in Laura's section.  She's super cool and sweet.  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?

Without a doubt, my favorite burger spot in Phoenix.  The Chile Burger and the French Onion Burger are both masterpieces.  The beef is amazingly fresh and flavorful with the right ratio of meet to fat.  I always get mine medium/rare.  The buns are always fresh and soft.  And they aren't skimpy either.  Some high end spots in town...who shall be left nameless...give you these tiny little burgers (almost sliders) and think charging you $15 (a-la-carte, mind you) is fair.  Not St. Francis!!  No sir!!  Big, beefy, juicy, loaded burgers with a generous side of perfectly fried, hand cut French fries for about thirteen bucks!  Great deal for a filling, high quality, gourmet burger experience.  My friend Tanner swears by the pork chops.  I've never tried them, but next time I go, I might have to get a side of pork chops with my burger!!  (To my wife: That was a joke).  Guy Fieri has featured St. Francis on Triple D, and the first time I went I had the sandwich that was featured on the show (the Pig Dip).  Wasn't a huge fan.  But the burgers are another story.  Again, THE BEST IN PHOENIX.  Very convenient parking, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar, relaxed and comfy atmosphere, friendly wait staff.  Highly recommend for a casual afternoon lunch or early evening bite before hitting the town.

Well, I found it. I finally found it. The best tacos in Phoenix. Hands down, no question, it's not even close.  I've lived here for about 4 months now and have been to about 20 different taco stands, joints, holes in the wall, trucks, and high end eateries who think charging $3.95 for a street taco is warranted. Damn them, I tell you! Damn them all to hell!!! TaCarbon is the real-deal-Holyfield, my taco loving compadres!  Nothing pretentious here. Not even plates. Everything, I mean everything, gets served on little styrofoam trays. Don't expect to sit down and have a waiter come to your table and take your order either. You walk in, go straight up to the counter, order your food, grab some sauces, and take a seat. They will call your name when your food is ready. The place is small, jam packed, hot, with a line out the door. And you better know what you want when you get to the counter....patient customer service isn't on the menu.  The food, however, makes up for all that.  The tortillas are exceptionally yummy. I don't know if they make them in house or if they are delivered from somewhere else, but they are the best tortillas ever.  The Hazz (taco or burrito) is the best. Carne asada with roasted peppers and melted cheese on corn tortillas. Insanely good. I had a Hazz taco and burrito.  The Lorenza is another little nugget of heaven that you need to try. We tried almost every taco on the menu and we weren't disappointed with any of them.  If you want to taste the best tacos and burritos in Phoenix this is a place to go. The carne asada is amazing, the tortillas are out of this world, and the sauces are excellent.  Is it in the best neighborhood in town? No. But there are kids and families in a fun and relaxed environment.  Indoor and outdoor seating, oh, and ice cold cervezas!!!  And finally, each taco is under $2!!! Viva-la-good-deal!!!

This hotel is R-O-C-K-I-N'!!!!!!  The restaurants (you have to go to STK - see my review) are amazing, the clubs (do what you have to do to get into the Marquee) are insane, and the gorgeous people are, well, gorgeous.  The sheer amount of hot women that walk through this hotel/casino is ridiculous.  Every where you turn there is another one.  I give it 4 stars because I've never actually stayed in one of their rooms.  So i cant give it 5 stars.  but if their rooms and room service are anything like their eateries, clubs, and clientele, then I'm sure this place would get a 5 star rating!  Did I mention the plethora of hot women?!?!?  You gotta check out the giant chandelier.  when i say giant, i mean GIANT!.  it takes up almost the entire side of the floor.  you can actually hang out in it and order a drink in the bar that is in the chandelier.  its hard to explain, trust me, just go.

My friends and I were in Vegas over the weekend for a friend's birthday.  We had made reservations at STK and let me tell you, I can't recall a more fun, more awesome dinner experience I've ever had.  Everything, from the moment we walked in to the moment we stepped out, was perfect!  It was packed, it was loud, and it was busy.  So if you're looking for a quiet place to have a meal, turn around and go to grammas' house!  We got there a little early and bellied up to the bar for a round of drinks.  Pricey?  Yeah!  Worth it? !@#$ yeah!  Nothing watered down here folks.  Stiff drinks served in large glasses.  Some of the ladies in our group were feeling the effects after their first drink.  We sat at a large, comfy table in the main dining area right near the bar.  We were greeted by the best waitress/server I've seen in a long time; Michelle.  She was great.  Friendly, professional, attentive, knowledgeable, sweet, hot, fun, the whole package.  I took charge of the appetizers and we had a large seafood platter with crab, lobster, shrimp, oysters, sauces, and all kinds of other goodies.  I ordered 4 different salads for the table to share.  I roll with a pretty picky bunch when it comes to food.  I didn't hear a single complaint and all the appetizer plates were cleaned off!  Time for the entrees.  I ordered the "24 oz. porterhouse, medium rare, sliced off the bone please"!  OMG! Hot, juicy, perfectly marbled, sliced against the grain, so every beefy, juicy, fatty morsel was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  The sides were also wonderful.  The creamy Yukon potatoes, the parmesan truffle fries, the mushroom pot-pie, and of course, the mac n' cheese.  Each one brought a new element of flavor and texture to the party.  I don't have a negative thing to say about any of the food.  We all ordered different cuts of meat.  Some had the petite fillet, the cowboy rib-eye, the bone-in fillet, one of the ladies even ordered the roasted Dover sole! ( I take no responsibility for that one, but when she wasn't looking, I took a piece and that too was delish!)  Dessert time.  Michelle approached me and asked me if we'd like to see a dessert menu.  I told her it was my friend's birthday.  She simply said. "Would you like me to take care of it?"  Awesome!  That is exactly what I wanted to hear.  She took the initiative and made it happen.  A large tray with an assortment of desserts showed up a few minutes later with "Happy Birthday" inscribed in chocolate across the platter with candles.  Perfect.  I love it when a server takes control, shows leadership and "hooks it up".  All I remember is taking a spoonful of bread pudding, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drenched in a warm caramel sauce topped with what I think was Cap'n Crunch cereal and thinking to myself, "Now, I can die!".  In all honesty, I've had a better steak at CUT or Mastro's in Beverly Hills, but this steak is a very close second.  But neither CUT nor Mastro's (in the numerous times that I've been to each) even comes close to the service we got and the fun time we had at STK. NOT! EVEN! CLOSE!  Now, for the party that broke out in the restaurant during dinner.  This is where the fun comes in.  The resident DJ was inspiring!  He played the coolest, hippest, most fun, and most want-to-get-out-of-your-seat-and-sing-and-dance-along music ever!  From Sinatra, Bon Jovi, Journey, Kid Rock, Joan Jett, Jay-Z, Lady Ga-Ga, Madonna.  He turned this already loud and happening restaurant into a full blown night club.  We and the three or four tables around us were up and singing and dancing and jumping, and laughing, and drinking, and hugging like it was a wedding or something.  The nine of us all agreed, this was the most fun, and most memorable dinner experience we've ever had.  The next time you go to Vegas with a large group, go to STK, ask to sit in Michelle's section and be ready to party!  Thank you STK, Michelle and the rest of your team.  You guys gave us a night we'll never forget.

So glad I found this place.  Tucked away in a shopping center at the corner of Thomas and Hayden (next to the Pig & Pickle) you will find this no-frills, nothing-fancy-schmancy little shop.  But make no mistake, John (owner/operator) is really, REALLY good at what he does.  Super cool and friendly, his knowledge of watches was very impressive.  We talked about watches and other manly interests for a while.  lol.  I took in my old Tissot and Rolex for a polish and tune up along with a few other not-so-high-end pieces that were sitting in my drawer that needed batteries, clasps, bands etc.  Including a vintage Vulcan that was left to me by father.  Not a high end watch, but rare.  Everything was done in a couple of days.  And boy, was I pleased.  The Tissot, Vulcan, and Rolex looked brand new!  Polished to a super shine and running...well...like clockwork.  No pun intended.  John also went over all the details of what he did.  Really explained the mechanics of what was involved.  For a young guy, he truly knows his stuff.  Very reasonable prices too.  I was expecting to pay a lot more for the work he did.  He worked on a total of 6 watches, and for the work he did, in the time he did it, I couldn't be happier.  I wouldn't consider myself a watch collector or aficionado by any stretch.  But I really like to take care of the ones I do have.  I had a go-to guy in Los Angeles for years when I lived there.  I moved to Phoenix in April and I'm super stoked that I found John and Gemtime.  Oh, he also said he and his brother do jewelry repair as well.  My wife has a few pieces that could use some work.  Gonna take those to him this week too.

Was driving home with the wifey from a night out in Scottsdale. "Let's get some street tacos!" I said.  Quickly launched the Yelp app and came across this place.  Hmmmm, 4 and a half stars, pics look tasty, and jam packed. It must be good, right?  WRONG!!!!  This place is awful. I mean really really awful. Nothing we ate tasted good.  We had a chicken quesadilla, a steak quesadilla, a bean/cheese burrito, and asada tacos. They all sucked. The asada was bland and dry.  No salt at all.  Just charred pieces of meat.  The chicken was flavorless. The tortillas were stale. The bean and cheese burrito was an absolute disaster.  Please see the picture i posted.  No, that is not a plate of beans we ordered on the side.  That came out of 1/2 a burrito.  Bland, flavorless beans and some cheese wrapped in a greasy, half-ass-wrapped tortilla.  And who puts minced cabbage on steak tacos? The only taco that should have cabbage on it, is a fish taco. And the cabbage should be shredded, not pulverized.  The red sauce was not spicy at all, and lacked any kind of authentic Mexican flavor.  No condiments anywhere.  No variety of sauces, no radishes, no pickled jalapeños & carrots.  They just throw a couple of dried up lime wedges in your plate.  I saw a few people with some roasted jalapeños on their plate, but you have to specifically ask for it.  Quite possibly the worst taco joint I've ever been to.  The people who gave this place 5 stars should really get out more often.  This place is garbage.  Try PHX Burrito House down the street.  Much, MUCH better.  But those f***ers close early.  Or, for the best tacos and burritos in all of Phoenix, head over to Ta Carbon on 43rd near Thomas or on 59th near Camelback.  By the way, I ate there at 10:30.  I'm writing this review at 11:30...from my toilet!

This is it! I found it!  The one place that has the best bacon, the best hash browns, the best eggs, the best pancakes, the best maple syrup, the best toast, the best jam, and the best coffee all under one roof!!  I love Matts BB!  It has a local, relaxed vibe, the clientele is hip and  cool, and the staff is friendly and attentive.  There can be quite a long wait if you decide to go during peak weekend breakfast/brunch hours, but trust me, the wait is worth every minute.  When it comes to breakfast, I'm a pretty straight forward guy.  Bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast please.  And if I'm feelin' really hungry (and who are we kidding?  I'm always feelin' really hungry) i'll order a pancake for dessert.  Oh, and don't forget the coffee and OJ.   The bacon is unbelievably good; addictively good; sinfully good!  Thick, smokey, peppery, and mmmmmmmmmm, just perfect!  The hash browns are another masterpiece.  Crispy outside, tender and buttery inside.  The pancakes are delicious.  Light, fluffy, and and hot off the griddle; not dense and doughy like most diner pancakes.  You can taste the quality and freshness in every little detail.  The eggs, the toast, the jam, EVERYTHING!!  the decor is simple and unpretentious.  Just one big room with a bunch of tables, a bar that seats about 8 peeps, with a TV to watch Sunday morning football, (thanks for that, Matt!!), and a little side room that seats about 6-8 people in case you have a big group.  If you're ever in Phoenix, hungry, and looking for a down home place to have some down home grub with top notch quality, freshness and love for food, this is the place to be.  I cant wait to go back.

Just as you walk in from the parking lot of Culinary Drop Out, (a new Sam Fox project of mammoth proportions) and approach the hostess table, on your right side, you find yourself looking through a huge window into Little Cleo's. Looks like a classic dinner.  Subway tiles, old fashioned light fixtures, tables by the window, and a long bar overlooking the kitchen.  This place is spotless.  Clean, shiny, unpretentious, and comfy.  A quaint little eatery.    My girlfriend and I were there to have dinner at Culinary Drop Out with a group of friends (which we eventually did) but we got there first and there was at least a half hour wait.  So we decided to go into Little Cleo's and have a small bite or two while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  The service is impeccable.  Friendly, knowledgeable, professional staff who greet you with a smile, make great recommendations from the awesome menu, and a  are just as polite as can be.    We chatted up our server about the drink menu and he suggested I try the "Subtle Menace".  A potent, yet refreshing libation with gin, absinthe, sauv blanc, and lime.  Poured over ice it was absolutely delicious.  I felt the effects of that absinthe right away.  (To my Armenian friends, it tasted a bit like oghee).  My girl had the "Sour Cherry Paloma".  Top shelf tequila, veev acai, cherry bitters, and grapefruit juice.  Also, very refreshing, and very yummy.  Not quite as strong as my drink though.  Thank goodness.  Someone had to be responsible.  Then came the food.  WOW!!!  I was absolutely blown away.  We started off with the "warm jar of king crab and butter with grilled bread".  A small jar with succulent pieces of plump, sweet crab meat nestled in a slightly-more-than-warm bath of drawn butter, with just a hint of garlic.  Served along side a stack of rustic, crusty, toasted and buttered french bread.  I couldn't resist.  I stuck my fork in the jar, pulled out a mouthful of crab dripping with steamy melted butter, piled it on top of a piece of bread that i had dunked in the jar and shoved the whole think in my mouth.  Hey!  It's my birthday, I'll be obnoxious if i want to!  I was in culinary bliss.  Perfection!   Then came the  "bacon & eggs".  Get a load of this.  House made sturgeon (yeah, the fish) bacon, creme fraiche and toast topped with a sunny side up egg!  OOOOOOH, EMMMMMMMMMM, GEEEEEEEEEEE!  When i cut through the egg yolk, and that golden goodness oozed all over the crispy, buttered toast, i swear I had a culinary boner!  It was something i had never experienced before but cant wait to experience again.  Absolutely delicious.  Seasoned perfectly with the right amount of salt and pepper.  Sam Fox is a culinary titan in AZ.  He has so many eateries.  I've had the privilege to eat in several of them and none disappoint.  the next time I'm in AZ I'm going back to Little Cleo's for sure.  There is still a lot of menu that requires exploring!!  IF YOU LIKE SEAFOOD EVEN SLIGHTLY, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Great place.  Dog friendly, plenty of misters and fans to keep cool in the blazing Phoenix heat, great craft beers, corn hole and other outdoor games, friendly staff and the food is pretty...correction...VERY damn good too.  I had the Brisket Mac.  A generous portion of creamy, cheesy mac n' cheese, topped with slow cooked, succulent, brisket topped with more melted cheese, a smokey/spicy BBQ sauced topped with crispy fried onion rings.  This can ordered as an appetizer for the table, a side dish to share, or an entree for one.  Now, if you're one of those people who doesn't like dogs and gets all weird if a restaurant allows dogs inside I have three pieces of advice for you: 1) don't have kids because you're a horrible human being and shouldn't be allowed to have any influence over children. 2) Find the nearest (tall) bridge and jump off of it. 3) Don't go to OHSO because they allow dogs all over the place.  In fact they hold dog adoption drives on most weekends.  However, if you like dogs and don't mind seeing them around while you enjoy a great meal along with an ice cold beer while sitting outside watching people play out door games, this is definitley the place for you.  Oh, you can also sit inside the comfortable dinning area where they have a bar and TV's.
