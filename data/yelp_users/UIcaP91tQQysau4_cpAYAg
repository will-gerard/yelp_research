Cornish Pasty always makes me a happy girl. They have great beer, yummy food, and the staff is the best! The menu has a ton of choices for meat eaters as well as vegetarians and everything is made in house. The patio offers additional seating and the iPad is always playing memorable music.

We went with a large group from work on two different occasions. We called ahead and made reservations and both times the tables were not ready when we arrived. We also got poor service and it took forever to get our drinks, food and tabs. It was really disappointing.
