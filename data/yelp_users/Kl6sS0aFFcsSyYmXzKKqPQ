Some of the best pizza I've tasted! The sicilian is yum and it weighs a ton.

I love this circle k all the employees everytime I go in are polite and chatty. I don't think I've been to a better circle k although the new one on northern and 21st ish ave is a close second.

Love this hole in the wall place. See it all the time but never went in always wondered. Went in with my boyfriend and we both agreed Wed be back! The original wine Burger tasted fresh and juicy not over powering with spices just right. I loved the pub pickles wasn't expecting the spiciness boyfriend didn't care for them because of that but I gobbled them down. Loved their green tea and the were very friendly.

I worked at Macy's at metro for a long time and a couple of friends and I decided try this place randomly one day not knowing anything about this place. Loved the quirkiness of the red and white striped roof. Was surprised by the inside which I swear everytime I go there's new bumper stickers I haven't seen yet. So without even eating yet I thought to myself I like this place. Then the food came out and I have to say its sooo much better then subway or any other sandwich shop ive ever eat at. Loved the food and loved that the drinks have crushed ice! Awesome quirky place.

Okay so we go in one day after looking at best buy for a controller my boyfriend had to have for the ps3. We decided lets get something so he goes to port a subs and I go to the Greek pita which I though ah ill try it. The place was small but cozy staff is friendly and take out Woot. Needless to say I loved this place. My boyfriend hated port a subs was dissapointed. So we decided to come back so he could try it. He loves this place now too. We've been back several times and we've told friends about it. Awesome food!

Holly was awesome and I was looking for a black cinnamon herbal mix. She picked out a couple with me and actually suggested something out of left field a early grey tea which I'm not a fan of.. but one sniff and I had to try it. I bought more then I thought I would ...love the prices of the tea. I'll be back for sure since I just finished my tea about a week ago its about time lol.

We were going to panda express and notice the sign for this place and I though huh so went on yelp and found that it looked and the menu sounded Yummy and cheap...love cheap food haha. My boyfriend and I went here to try it out I love street tacos so was set on them but was wanting pozole yum. Decided on the carna asada three tacos and my boyfriend got the pollo tacos and we shared a quesadilla which was awesome loved the salsa too. The women at the counter was nice but kinda was confused when I asked for the three tacos deal...but its all good...loved the decor and the open sliding Windows awesome....dollar taco tuesdays are you kidding me we will be back lol!

Love this place customized food is awesome you get it the way you want it,cause you do it yourself. Yogurt is yum and the bowls are pretty good sizes. Love the feel of it being outdoors but still inside. Gotta check it out! Although I don't like parking lot at all that takes a star away for me mostly to crowded.
