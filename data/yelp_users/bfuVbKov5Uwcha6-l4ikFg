I went here for lunch yesterday with a few friends/coworkers and thought it was the cutest place I have been in a long time.  I have to admit, the area seemed a little weird to me, but maybe its just because I'm not familiar with the area.  We entered, and were immediately greeted and told that there is a hearing for the liquor license on the 28th...so that should definitely be a plus for this place.  There was a gentleman playing guitar which was very nice, but just a wee bit too loud for ambiance - we had a hard time hearing each other.  Two of my meal mates shared the hummus to start, I tried it and it was awesome as were the dolmas served on the side.  It all looked fresh and was presented very nicely.  I ordered the Champs de Elysee' sandwich which was TO DIE FOR...if you like brie, I highly recommend it.  The soup of the day was crab bisque.  When I asked our server if it was a red or white bisque he told me "neither" and then let me know that most of their items were nontraditional.  He wasn't lying.  I don't think there was a piece of crab in my bisque.  It was more of a broth, with large potato chunks and pieces of grape/vine leaves.  It wasn't bad, I just don't think I would get it again.  Everyone else enjoyed their food.  The two downers that prevent me from being able to give it 5 stars are the lack of parking - some stupid macho man twit in his white Dodge Ram was blocking most of the driveway then almost runs me over trying to get a spot in the parking lot when he could have just as easily parked where he was sitting on the side of the road (which is where I ended up parking btw) and the soup.  It just wasn't a crab bisque

Now, this one doesn't really fit into any category, because it is a nonprofit org, but I really felt compelled to put a review in for it to help get the word out.  This is such a great way to volunteer your time, and they are always in need of Bigs, especially men.  The boys waiting for a Big sometimes have to wait for a year just to get one, and with some of these children, they need someone now.  If you have a few extra hours a month, a tiny bit of your time can help do wonders for a child.  I have been a Big since February, and it is such a rewarding experience.  For privacy issues, I won't go into the details of my Little, but she is a really great girl.  She gets excited every time we talk and she makes as much of a difference in my life as I do hers.  Some of the things we have done together: mini golf Dave and Busters movies (lots) Ceramic painting at As You Wish Children's Literacy Luncheon - AZ Kidney Foundation  And we've also just hung out at my house and talked.    There are so many kids out there who just need someone to talk to, and to show them that they are special and important.  If you have the time and energy, I don't think that there is a better place that you could spend it.

So on the advice of Michelle's review, my friend Brian (my lunchtime buddy) and I ventured over here for lunch the other day.  I won't go into too much detail, but I will say that it was good.  Not amazing, but good.  However, I have never had El Salvadorian food before, so maybe I needed to be broken in.  I started with the mango iced tea which tasted a little like dirt, not horrible, but had a dirt flavor to it if that makes any sense.  I saw the guys next to me get these bright neon yellow drinks with chunks floating in them and decided I must try it.  It turned out it was the ensalada drink, which I thought meant "salad" but maybe that's my American translation.  Apparently it means "delicious fruit salad" drink.  I ate the chunks out of it, trying to figure out what each one was.  I was thinking it was something exotic, so I made Bri try it, turns out it was apple.  Oops.  So it has apple, pineapple and carrot chunks, maybe not exotic, but still delicious.  The little shooter of soup is good.  Its like a chicken noodle without the noodle with potatoes thrown in for good measure.  I got the appetizer combo that Michelle got, it was plenty of food for a meal.  I don't know what was what, but I like the flat tortilla looking thing with the cheese the best...it was either a pupusa or a posteles, but it was good!  The tamale was different than the typical, it was not wrapped in a corn husk but what looked like a palm frond, but I could be wrong.  Heck, I couldn't even identify an apple that day!  It also had shredded chicken, potatoes and carrots in it.  Very tasty.  They also serve this soupy tomatoey salsa that is very mild.  That, combined with the slaw they serve as a garnish really adds some taste to most of the items.  They also give you 1 "tortilla" per person.  Its their version of a tortilla, but much different than the Mexican version.  This is much smaller, and thicker, almost like a pita, gordita or fry bread.  My friend got some sort of chicken dish with a large amount of what looked like sour cream underneath it.  Unfortunately for him, he hates sour cream, but some rearranging of the plate and some dousing in tomatoey salsa and he was good to go.  I tried to order the "quesadilla" dessert thing that Michelle  mentioned because I truly wanted to know what the bastard child of cheesecake and cake would taste like, plus the name was intriguing...but they were out.  They were also out of their carne asada, which looked good.  Other people had some.   It was busy when we were there, but the service was good and everyone was really friendly.  There was even a very large table of about 15 people in there celebrating a birthday and everyone (OK, well me and my friend and the servers) sang to them.    I think I want to go back now and try the chile relleno and some more of the "tortilla" wrapped cheesy meaty deliciousness.  UPDATE -  I wonder if that's a record for an update (10 minutes)! I just noticed in the beginning I said I won't go into too much detail, then proceeded to go into perfect detail.  I guess its impossible for me not to be long-winded.  Oh well...you finished reading, now do you feel like you wasted 5 minutes of your life? :)

Despite all of the "glowing" (insert sarcasm) reviews about this place, some friends and I decided that this would be a great spot for happy hour.  Just as I was told, I saw a drug deal going down within my first 5 minutes of being there, at 5:30 PM.  There were lots of blue collar workers just getting off work and relaxing.  Everyone seemed to just be enjoying their Friday night.  Some other reviewers said they didn't exactly feel safe, but I felt pretty safe, however I did have a large group of guys with me.  The drinks were cheap, darts were fun.  The clientel was not my favorite, karaoke SUCKED...the PA system was awful and kept cutting out and almost everyone there wanted to sing R&B or rap...nothing against the two, I just like some variety in my ear-splitting karaoke.  Oh, and the folding table covered by a tent smoking area was pure class all the way.  I appreciate the experience but don't think I'll be going back.  I love dives, just not this one.

Oh man, am I the only one who loves Macayo's??    They have great chips that are always served extremely quickly, and delicious salsa that they will readily fill back up.  Whenever my coworker and I feel like eating fatty, unhealthy food, we always go there for the Baja Burro - oh my gosh...so good!  It is a burrito, filled with either chicken, steak or shrimp, covered in baja sauce and cheese.  Its freaking delicious!  You can also get a bean and cheese burrito Baja Style if you choose and they will add all of this deliciousness to your bean and cheeser.  I want to go for happy hour and try their new watermelon and honeydew margs because those sound delish.  Anyway, I totally recommend this place for a quick lunch, I've never been disappointed and never left even remotely hungry.  In fact, most times I feel I need a wheelchair.

Two words - Das Boot!!  For anyone that has seen BeerFest, you will know what I am referring to, and this little German Sausage lets you indulge your inner alcoholic movie character by allowing actual people to order Das Boot.  Now, no human being really needs that much beer - I think its more for the thrill of drinking from a 3 foot glass boot (remember to turn it - another Beer Fest reference) however it is fun, and I watched two guys get sick trying.  The beer got gross and warm, but the fun kept coming.  They had a fun band playing and we danced our asses off while eating soft pretzels dipped in cheese sauce and other supposed German delicacies.  We had a large group with us and they allowed us to rent out the front room next to the bar.  We had a great time and the staff was really nice.  However, I think someone stole das boot that night and for that I feel very bad for them - I mean, who needs a 3 foot boot anyway?

Awesome, honest guy. Took my car in today because I thought I needed my brake pads replaced. He took a look at them with me there and let me know that it looked like I still had some life in them but he would put the car on the lift to check the brake pads on the inside. He confirmed that I still had a few thousand miles left in them and that it was safe to drive. Never had a mechanic not try to sell me on something. I appreciate him saving me the money for now. I will definitely be going back to him for all future needs. Word of advice, there is no sign out front and it's a one man shop so call first to set an appt if you can.

Due to an unfortunate situation that left me without AC on one of the hottest days of 2008 (yesterday) I was forced to find a place to spend the night where I wouldn't wake up in drenched sheets.  Thanks to a low bid on Priceline that was somehow amazingly accepted, I ended up spending the evening at the lovely Hyatt Gainey Ranch - I'm not kidding, I bid $55 and they accepted!  I wasn't even trying to get into this hotel, just looking for a nice one, cheap - I'm frugal :)  Other people were paying upwards of $300 last night, and I got in for $69 after tax - AMAZING!  I went thinking I could get lots of work done on my laptop, but when I ventured downstairs to view the grounds I fell in love and decided that I must try out their pinot grigio (on a side note, I think I should make a list of best pinot in the city because all of my reviews have to do with it).  The lobby bar is beautiful, open and airy and there were even ducks venturing in to say hello.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  A friend decided to meet me there for dinner, so while I ventured outside for a cigarette (I know, I know) I examined the pool area (beautiful) and even found a lovely terrace area with string lights above it overlooking the lake - I am in love!  I think that I must get married here.  Now, for the pesky problem of the engagement ring...just a formality, at least I know where the nuptials will take place...but I digress.  There are so many lovely seating areas and the only thing that made me sad was that I could not be there to take advantage of the lovely pool area during the day.  There were some renovations going on, but it did not affect my stay in the least and I didn't hear a thing.  The only thing I found a bit weird was that I had a corner room so my balcony was connected to my neighbors, separated only by wood lattice-work that didn't have any vines on it and was so high that I could have ducked and walked below it.  Good thing my neighbors weren't crazy psycho killers.  However, it did make the idea of sitting on my balcony, eating my lox bagel and drinking my coffee this morning a little less appealing because I would have had to stare at, and share the space with my neighbor...kinda awkward.

I ate here for the first time on yesterday morning (Memorial Day) while nursing a sweet hangover from having too much fun the day before.  We arrived just a bit after 8, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  This food was great!   Being from the south I LOVE biscuits and gravy, so I was excited when I saw BC's B&G (Breakfast Club's Biscuits & Gravy) on the menu.  However I was equally as excited about the Oscar Eggs Benedict.  My server made it easy for me to decide when she told me they were out of the crab meat which is used to make the Oscar.  A few delicious cups of coffee later, my B&G arrived, looking delicious with a side of some perfectly ripe fruit and yummy potatoes.  The B&G is actually jalapeno biscuits, which taste almost doughy.  They were good, but different.  Then they are topped with melted fontina, eggs, sausage gravy and some hot sauce.  The only thing I would change is the cheese.  For some reason, the fontina just added an odd taste to an otherwise delicious meal.  I still ate about 3/4 of it, but would definitely request a different type of cheese next time.  My two dining companions each got a different type of omelet and they both enjoyed them.  With its close proximity to my house, I definitely think I will be dining here quite  a bit.

I gotta say, I might be the only one, but I just wasn't that blown away with this place.  Having just moved to the area, I was very excited to find out we had a sushi joint within a mile of our home.  I was even more excited when I read the other reviews on here.  Of course, no one reviewed the sushi yet.  We has been in the pool all day and were looking for something that we could bring back home.  We stopped in, grabbed a sushi menu and headed for the waiting area framed by this amazing crystal dragon.  We spent about 5 minutes just discussing this dragon and how much we wanted to touch it but were sure we would ruin it and the Tottie's SWAT would come looking for us.  After reviewing the menu I noticed that the selection was much smaller than some other places.  We opted for 4 rolls and salmon nigiri.  We waited around for awhile and I think the hostesses forgot about us because they finally walked back to check on someone else, saw me and said Oh!  You're sushi is ready at the front.  We grab it, pay $42 and head home - less than 2 minutes.  I get home to see that the sushi is small - smaller than what you get at the grocery store with very very little actual fish in it.  The avocado was turning slightly brown (probably from the wait up front) and it just didn't make me say Wow at all.  We ate it (well, most of it) because we were hungry but I have to say I don't think I will be getting sushi from there again.  Maybe it was an off night, I just wouldn't recommend it.  Expecially not for that price.  I would have been better going off to Ra.    However, its cute inside and I like the crystal dragon so they get 2 stars.  Maybe I'll go back sometime and try some of the other food people are raving about.

Oh, how I love thee Ticoz.  From your close proximity to my work making for the perfect happy hour spot, to your very large glasses of pinot grigio highlighted by your awesome patio with the couches.  And, let's not forget about the great food and the wonderfully adorable bartenders and servers.  My first time at Ticoz was last summer for a birthday happy hour.  It was hot and sweaty, but I had a great time.  About 10 of us gathered on the patio and talked and laughed until the sun went down.  I've had quite a few happy hours here and 1 lunch and one evening meal.  The lunch was amazing!  I don't remember what it was called, I believe "palm frond chicken" or something to that effect.  Their chop salad is to-die-for with a light dressing and corn, garbanzos.  Just amazing.  Their service is always great and when I was going in regularly they always remembered me and knew what my friend and I wanted to drink.    They've taken down their sign (don't know why) so it is a little harder to find now and its kindof a bitch getting there when 7th St has that suicide lane thing going (thats a whole nother review) but I will always love this place and will deal with the traffic to get there.

Woot Woot!  That's what my belly says when I walk into Lenny's.  My arteries hate me, but my belly and taste buds love me.  If I could dive into a pool of ranch with Lenny's fries I would.  Their burgers are great, and their chicken sandwiches are amazing.  Those are the only things I have tried there, but I've heard good things bout the tuna melt also.    Its fast, small and slightly frenzied.  I ususally take it to go during lunch hour.  But you can sidle up to the counter like a real old-fashioned burger joint.  They also make yummy shakes and malts.  I swear, this is where you wanna go if you are breaking your diet.  Yum!

I ordered from Banana Leaf last night.  We had the food delivered and I was beyond impressed.  3 meals was enough for 4 people, with some food leftover!  Delivery took close to an hour, but it was worth it.  It totally cured by chinese food cravings.  We ordered mongolian beef, sesame chicken and sweet chili thai beef (or something like that).  The meat was not chewy or processed, it was crispy where it needed to be and had a really good flavor.    If you're looking for your chinese food fix I would totally recommend this place.

Yay for Hana!  I guess I'm a little late to find this place but thanks to my friend Brian who loves to try out new places as much as I do (next up, BreadFruit) we went to Hana today for lunch.  I was impressed.  After my less than stellar experience with Tottie's earlier this week I still had a major hankering for some raw fish...Hana to the rescue!  I had no idea about the small space and the lunch rush but thankfully we got there right around noon and were able to walk right up to the sushi bar and sit down.  After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef (didn't get his name) we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try.  Within a minute, we were handed this interesting appetizer of a few tortilla chips with a yummy crab salad with a rice vinegar tasting base.  It reminded me of squid salad - either way, it was on the house and was very tasty.  Our first roll came out very quickly and was followed by a bowl of pickled wasabi to try with the sushi.  I have eaten at MANY sushi restaurants, but have never been given this.  Yum!  Placed on top of the sushi it is very good, definitely try it.  We went through each of the rolls - the Alaska was very good, the salmon nigiri was amazing, literally so fresh it melted in my mouth.  The Vegas roll and the Dynamite roll were great as well.    As we are finishing, the sushi chef starts talking to us about Giant Clam.  Neither of us had seen a Giant clam before, so he pulled it out and starts showing us how it splashed you with salt water that comes out of its mouth.  I thought it was very interesting, I'm not sure if the lady next to me did because she got salt water on her.  My friend and I had to take a picture because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen but like something I have definitely seen, all at the same time.  Its a little scary, I'm not going to lie.  In fact, it looks slightly like something from a 70s porn movie.  That's just what I've heard, not that I've ever seen a 70s porn, I mean, what kind of a girl do you think I am? Gosh!  I took a picture on my phone so I will post it here for those of you who have never seen one.  Overall, I had a good experience.  As someone said earlier, the food tastes so much better when the sushi chef is smiling and enjoying himself.  It was just fast enough for a lunch hour, just enough food, and just enough fun.   However, it did get very busy after we arrived and there was a wait when we left.  I would recommend getting there early to avoid the rush.   Oh, and if you're adventurous, apparently that scary looking giant clam is delicious when sauteed :)  I will let one of you try it first and let me know what you think.  I'm not that brave yet.

*Disclaimer - I am a little heated about this subject so there may be some foul language, for that I apologize*  United - You.Fucking.Suck.  If it was possible for me to give you negative stars I would.  Now this review isn't actually for the Phoenix branch, but for the company as a whole, because the Phoenix employees were great.  I will have to try to make this as brief as possible, because I could write a novel about my hatred for this God forsaken company.  In brief: On a business trip from Phx to Winnipeg, Canada my bags were tagged incorrectly in Phoenix.  They put my tags on someone else's bags and vice versa on mine.  Needless to say when I arrived in Canada  - no bags!  The worst part, it was FREEZING.  Like 30 degrees F.  I had just come from hot ass Phoenix wearing only a tank top, thin sweatshirt and capris.  Fast forward to the end of my trip.  Not only have I not received my bags, I have received no help from the 1-800 number that was outsourced to India (don't even get me started).  I told people numerous times that my bag was not where they thought it was (Denver) but was where the other lady whose tags I had went.  Do you think they listened...NO!  They continued to read their script, over and over and over again.  If I could have reached through the phone and slapped them I would have.  I had to buy all new stuff for this business trip, stuff I will never need again, then buy a new suitcase to haul all the shit back in.  When I arrive back in Phoenix in the dirty capri pants I had been wearing for 4 days I go to the baggage claim office to speak to a real person, in person.  The woman there found my bag in 2.5 seconds, and it was right where I told her it was.  Too bad the fuckers on the 1-800 number couldn't do their jobs properly and figure that out.  Oh, and they have the same systems, and can see the same stuff as the people in Phoenix, I asked.  I was told my bag would arrive back that day, but it didn't come.  So then I was told it would come back the next evening, very late and would be returned to my house.  I wake up at 1 AM, almost one week after the last time I had seen my bag to find a black rolling suitcase on my porch.  Hooray!  But my excitement was short-lived, because that bag was not mine!  They had switched my bag AGAIN!  Really?  Twice?  Now that's just stupid...who isn't doing their job.  I had to drive back to Phx International for the third time, pay parking for the third time and deliver the poor schmo's bag that was on my porch.  After a 2 hour wait my bag comes back.  Reunited, and it feels so good.  Now for the best part.  It has taken 2 nasty faxes to United to get them to respond to my requests for reimbursement of the things I had to buy.  Yesterday I get an envelope in my mailbox from them - nope, not a check.  A request for my receipts.  Really?  I think that was included in the 15 page fax I sent to you twice.  Or are you really that incompetent?  So here I sit, 2 weeks later, $400 poorer and mad as hell.    If you can get away with it, don't fly United.  They don't care about their customers at all.

They still fucking suck.  But I should say that I did get a whole whopping $150 back from United for the items I had to buy and have not used.  Oh, my friend just had her bag lost by United this past weekend also.  The people on the 1-800 in India were just as useless to her as well.  I don't even know why they have their systems there if they can't seem to tell you anything.  "I'm sorry for your inconvenience maam, but we do not have record stating whether or not your bag made it on the plane."    They make you pay extra to check the bags, just so they can lose them.  Its total bullshit and there is nothing we can do about it.

I went here for Happy Hour one night after finding it on Yelp - thanks yelp!    I really liked it.  However, I should preface this with saying I like older buildings and unique architecture.  This place fits right in downtown.  I love the social outdoor couches, the rocking chairs on the large porch and the small inside rooms with hardwood floors.  I almost felt like I was back in the south.  They need more bathrooms, or at least bigger bathrooms, but I guess you work with the space you got right?  However, I one point, I had to go so bad, I went into the men's which had no line.  I got a few funny looks on the way out, but I didn't care, I had the sweet relief of having gone to the bathroom.  Their chicken strips and fries were delicious!  They had an amazing batter on them and the fries were superb.  I would definitely recommend.  They have a good beer selection and I was able to get a lovely bottle of my favorite - pinot grigio.

I have to say, I really like this place.  I have been here twice within the past two weeks, and both times were enjoyable.  The first time we went strictly for drinks.  Four of us shared the beer tower - 3 Liters of domestic beer served in a huge clear tower with a tap right on your table.  Talk about an attention getter.  It definitely isn't what you want to drink if you are trying to be inconspicuous, plus your beer can get warm if you don't drink fast enough.  But if you order one of those you can't say you're there just for a quick drink...  There was also a great girl walking around on the patio singing songs which was cute and pretty cool, I liked it.  People were riding the bull and having a good time and it was a good atmosphere.  Pretty laid back and chill - it was a Wednesday night.  I went back again for a Sunday brunch and was blown away at the $2 mimosas and bloody mary's.  All different types and they are cheap enough that you can try them all - very impressed.  However, if you are ordering food, make sure you haven't eaten in a day or can split with someone.  The portions are the biggest I've ever seen.  I'm not kidding.  They bring out a PLATTER for each person.  My omelette probably had 10 eggs in eat.  I only ate a few bites.  Overall, its a cool place with a cool vibe and I would recommend it just for the drink specials.

I ate here last night while staying at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch - but I would recommend this place even if you are not staying at the hotel.  It is classic Italian food with a very modern twist.  The interior is elegant but extremely modern, with a lovely wooden bridge taking you into the entryway with a very LARGE red door.  Our waiter was very helpful and answered all of our questions.  My friend and I ordered a bottle of pinot grigio (not a surprise if you've read any of my other reviews) however they did not have the same kind that was available at the lobby bar about 100 feet away.  That was a slight disappointment because that wine was VERY good.  We started by splitting a salad, but as I learned there is really no need to split as they are very small - as a starter, but are very good.  I could have easily eaten the whole thing myself.  I cannot remember the name, as I could barely pronounce it last night, but it has grilled red onion, spring mix, and macadamia nuts  - it was delicious.  They also serve bread with a very tasty and slightly citrusy olive oil for dipping.    For my main course I ordered the penne pomodoro.  It came with lots of delicious minced bacon and mushrooms, along with an arugula salad on top.  It wasn't creamy like I was afraid it would be, but very good, with a slight kick to it.  I loved it.  My friend had the tortellini with buffalo mozzarella and she loved it, finished every bite.  We did not have enough room for dessert, but I bet it was great.  Overall, out meal was about $85 for the 2 of us, not too pricey, but not for everyday dining.  If you're looking for something different, I would highly suggest this for a night out.  You can get valet parking, start with drinks in the lovely hotel lobby watching the sunset and venture over to Alto.  And I almost forgot the best part...you get 2 free rides on the gondola with each meal.  Yes a gondola, like in Italy, where the gondoliers even sing to you.  I haven't gone yet, saving it for a romantic adventure - my friend and I decided it wouldn't be as romantic with the 2 of us.

When I was planning my wedding last year, I was also with child (like Sophie below) so I decided that I needed to find a great tailor that would take care of my dress quickly, because I wasn't sure how much my growing midsection would change within a few weeks time.  I bought my dress 2 sizes too big, because I wasn't sure how much fabric would be needed, and took it to Valentina 2 weeks before the big day.  Not only did she take it in perfectly, but she did it in only a few days and only charged me $30!!  Score one for the prego bride.  I would highly recommend her, she was great, fast and professional.
