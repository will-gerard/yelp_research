75% of the time they mess up your order.  Out of the entire store there is only one friendly guy up front.  Everyone else acts bothered if you ask about anything.    The pizza itself tastes good and you really can't beat the price for the pizza that's the only reason I go back, but if they could only make it the way you order?!

This walmart is so raunchy and busy with creepy people. The store itself is not clean or organized well either.  I try to stay away from this location, but my child forgot socks when we went bowling up the road. I definitely made sure we were in and out.

This CVS is my number one pick in the area.  The assistant manager knows me by name because she pays attention to detail well or I frequent the place or something. Geez!  They typically have good discounts and have cases of bottled water for really cheap very often. Since it's a rip off the begin with I buy the store brand water which we conveniently stock up on for the kids sports & etc.    They have a drive thru Rx drop off/pick up lane, a photo kiosk, they also take passports photos, and oh yeah they sell alcohol now.  It's a great local drug store that's always nice and tidy and the employees are customer service driven.

The Nathan Burton family comedy show was so fun and entertaining!  We had 4 kids and 4 adults with a diverse age range and everyone really enjoyed this show.    It is a great daytime treat and a change off the beaten path of gambling, shopping or walking the casinos.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys laughing with some magic to beef up the show.  Tip: get there early as seats are 1st come basis.   The line will be very long so an hour+ before the show arrival is wise.   Money well spent, for an unforgettable fun time with my beautiful family!!!

I really liked the stylist I had, her name is Tracy.  She did a great job and the prices are pretty much in line w/other salons.   One thing I did appreciate is the fact that although the salon is trendy and very nicely set up, the stylists in there are actually all down to earth and friendly rather than being snobby or anything like I had anticipated from past experiences at other nice establishments like this.   The only reason why I didn't give it a five star and rated a four is because I wasn't offered a beverage throughout my service.    However, I did receive one later when I asked. :)   All in all, they were great!  Most importantly I am very happy w/my style!

1st time here. I hear it's really good! Rtf  Okay, here we go in a New York minute I'll sum this up...  Times Square lived up to the word on the street.  Cheese Stuffed Tortellini is worth every calorie and the savory veggie pizza is a veggie lovers dream come true!  During lunch rush seating took place within five minutes, then the food came out steaming hot and ready within twenty minutes.  The waitress and everyone else were friendly and quick with beverage refills.    I did notice with the small capacity room that if a lot a people are waiting, it can become an issue considering their limited waiting area section & bar.    I enjoyed the food and overall service, so YELP I recommend this place!

Do not be mislead by previous reviews....  This place is a awesome spot to celebrate or go hang out with the family while having fun in a upbeat environment. We have been there to celebrate birthdays numerous times and also have been there on other occasions "just because" and we have been very pleased.   Of course the Volcano Nachos are a must, but the other appetizers are good too.  Hot wings and the sampler are some other options you won't be disappointed with.  During our last visit, our party of 10 had meals like the BBQ ribs, (so delish!) fried chicken (mmm!) and fajitas. (so yummy!).  All our entr√©es were great!  Desserts are also mouth watering.  The chocolate hurricane is my fav!!   The manager there Dan, personally walked over to us to introduce himself and asked us how everything was.  That was very customer service focused in my book!  Our sever Bryan was extremely attentive, friendly, and very quick.  Our drinks were refilled like on auto pilot, we never had to ask for a refill once, Bryan was that freakin' good!   They have totally cool live entertainment, balloons for kids, a DJ, tv's with classic music videos, a dance floor and very neat Caribbean decor, but best of all it's FREE!   Overall, Margaritaville and the parrot heads offer a great time!  They have excellent customer service, not to mention the food is very tasty as well!  We will definitely be back here or to the one in Las Vegas!   If you think it's overpriced, umm this is not a Denny's.  You get whatcha pay for!!   Perhaps try happy hour from 4-7pm and you will still reap the bennies and get the Jimmy Buffet experience on a budget.   PS:  it's 5 o'clock somewhere! ;)

I love this Fry's!  It is by far one of the best marketplace stores in the Phoenix area.  They don't have gas, but they have a Tully's cafe, a sushi counter, and a large stock of furniture and patio items.  It is always very neat.  Never crazy busy in there and the employees are pretty friendly.

I really like this store, makes me feel like an aspiring chef!  Whoa, ok maybe not so much, but it does rock!  I'm sure we'll be back & make this place a ritual shopping spot for EVOO since we normally buy it to begin with for our home cooking.  It's very helpful that you can sample any, yes I mean ANY of the balsamic vinegars (BV) or extra virgin olive oils (EVOO), from there you can select & bottle your own (So cool, I know right!) or grab the one/s you desire to purchase.    Large bottles cost $15.50 each they also have small bottles & a small variety pack of 4.  I'm unsure of those prices since I only bought large bottles.  I went for the Blackberry Ginger BV & the Cilantro Roasted Onion EVOO, can't wait to whip something up with those today!  I like to add cilantro to most my Latin cooking to provide that extra zesty flavor.  They had a sampling event going on the day we were in & a very sweet & experienced lady named Nancy had made some delish lamb meatballs made with Blackberry Ginger BV & Basil EVOO.  They had other great tasting samples, but I don't recall the mixes used.   They also sell tasty jellies, Holly Moses habanero sauce which is really good too & I believe I saw pastas available as well. They have so many great choices you'll be amazed!  If you like to shop locally like me or you're near the area def check them out.  It seems as though this is a family owned & operated business.  The staff is courteous & truly helpful.  Start your new kitchen creations today!

Yogurt Garden has a friendly staff and awaits with a nice variety of great yogurt flavors. It is considered one of my little girls local faves!   They have a tasty selection and a decent choice of yummy toppings for your lickety splits craving!   The price increased a bit, but it is still very reasonable and not bad. The establishment is always neat and tidy which is very welcoming and cool for a downtime hangout spot. Next time you want some delicious yogurt that will hit the spot give them a try. Enjoy!

When I first visited Anthem and fell in love with the community, the park is where it all evolved!  My kids really enjoy visiting the park during the spring and fall while the weather is bearable in AZ. :)     They kids like the jungle gym area, the water park, the train of course, fishing, and playing at the volleyball courts.  There is also a nice skate park that is normally filled with kids doing their tricks and riding skateboards, but luckily for me (injury wise) my kids are not into that.   The community park does an excellent job at coordinating family events often.  There are events like for Easter, Music in May, 4th of July, autumn festival and a lot more.  We normally go to the events, they are really fun.  If you ever visit I suggest you swing by.....perhaps literally!
