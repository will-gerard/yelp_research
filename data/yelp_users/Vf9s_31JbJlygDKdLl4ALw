Awful. Just, awful.   I brought my car in at 8:30am after calling first to ask if they could finish my car by the end of the day and if they had an available courtesy shuttle to take me to work while they had my car.   The gentleman who took my car in, Steve, told me the driver is never out more than 30 minutes and would be back in no time to take me. He also confirmed that my car would be in and out today.   When I went inside the waiting room, the gentlemen at the desk informed me that the driver only leaves once an hour and it would be 45 minutes before the driver could take me. Not having that kind of time, I arranged another ride and had to walk half a mile and sit in the cold to wait for them.   I then got a call from Steve badmouthing the men in the waiting room saying they opened their mouths when they shouldn't have and had no idea what they were talking about. I have very little respect for employees that badmouth the company or co-workers. The men in the waiting room were FAR friendlier and more accommodating than Steve. Had they been the men to do the vehicle intake and follow up with the service, my business would still be Chapman's.   So, after leaving my car off at 8:45 am, I called to check in around noon. Steve said he hadn't heard from his mechanic and he would go ask him and call me right back. An hour later, I had heard nothing. I called back and they couldn't get a hold of Steve. Finally, he was tracked down and it turns out they hadn't even done the diagnostic test yet, let alone start working on my vehicle.   I told them not to do anything and I would come pick up the car. When I arrived and asked for my vehicle, Steve seemed a little annoyed that I was taking the car. Yeah, Steve, I'm pissed I have to do this too...  I called AutoNation Ford in Scottsdale and a very friendly and informative man, Mike, said he would not charge me to look at the vehicle, (Steve at Chapman wanted $110 unless the issue was covered by warranty, which is standard) and when I brought it in, promptly stopped what he was doing, shook my hand, gave me his card and told me to call him directly with any questions or issues. He came straight out to my car and was honest with the wait time before my car would been seen.   After looking at more reviews, it seems Chapman is NO NOT NEVER and AutoNation, with whom I've dealt before, is the only dealership I'll go to again.     The only reason they got 2 stars was because after speaking with a CSR on LiveChat, a manager called me personally to inquire about my experience.   He was very kind, understanding and did not push me to bring the car back for a second chance. He thanked me for my time and for my feedback and was very professional and personable.

I've used LA fitness, private martial arts gyms, done home fitness, etc.   I have to say, Smart Gym is the way to go! It's more than reasonably priced (PT is extra) and the equipment is awesome. Plenty of cardio, machines, weights and TRX and classes.    I worked with a trainer a few times and man, they really get you working, even in the 30 min sessions.   Staff is friendly and helpful and my trainer was very knowledgeable.    Here's the cherry on top, the corporate office. Usually when you call a corporate office you get the run around, talk to machines, etc.  I had a billing question that the front desk was unable to answer. Someone from front desk emailed a member of the billing department at corporate and within five minutes, the corporate office called me to answer my question. She was refreshingly helpful and friendly.   I live in s. Scottsdale and this place is worth the drive!

Great place to watch the game and stay for the party till the wee hours. Never get sick of this place.   Great bar staff and surprisingly great food. Not your typical freezer-burnt bar food!
