Food is great every time along with excellent customer service. Everyone is so enviting, polite, and prompt. I mainly go there for a one of a kind pizza, the BBQ chicken is a good choice it's my favorite, the spinach artichoke dip is to die for with the garlic bread, and of course the famous cookie pizza with a choice of any cookie.

WORST DIVE BAR I'VE EVER BEEN TO, first and last time going there. Would give negative stars if I could. My friends and family spoke so highly of this bar and it's been around forever so I figured it would be great. A big group of friends took me there for my 21st birthday at midnight. The second the clock turned midnight I took out my ID and ordered a drink. The bartender was the biggest cunt of a woman I have ever met in my life. She was questioning my ID and thinking it was a fake and being a bitch about what time it was. Like she didn't know that when its midnight, it's the next day... Thank goodness I was with such a big group of people that were all there for my bday and backed me up. She rolled her eyes all night at us and gave us the rudest attitude for the very short hour we were there. Like I'm sorry you hate your life right now and feel the need to try and bring everyone down with you and your misery, leave it at home bitch. She was the only person working but not like it was busy on a Wednesday night at 1am and that place is tiny. She kept disappearing whenever we wanted to order more drinks/shots, so we decided to leave. But couldn't because she was gone for at least 15 minutes that time and had all of credit cards behind the bar. Low key we could have hopped the bar, grabbed our cards and left. She finally came out and we paid. Btw when I looked at credit card statement the next morning, she put in the wrong tip amount I left her. I'm assuming on purpose because she's a cunt and I did indeed tip her poorly for the worst service I've ever had. I didn't care enough to call and get my money back, she obviously needed it more than me. So we dipped to CJ'S TALLEY'S PUB, and saved the night! Do not go to Pomeroy's. (:

Texaz Grill is amazing! I've been dinning there since I was a child. There's no place like it in the city. The decor is very unique and not like something you have seen before if raised in phoenix. The place is always packed I've never seen it not busy. Very welcoming staff as well. They serve the best home style cooked delicious food. I usually always get their specialty the chicken fried steak. It's defiantly my favorite and the main reason I keep coming back. It's a huge helping, almost falling off the plate because it's so big and you get 2 pieces with 2 sides! They also have great BBQ, fried foods, deserts, a great wine and beer list, and so much more. If you haven't tried texaz grill you must go!

Finally found a good Chinese food place! It's always a hit or miss and this was definitely a hit! We just moved to the Arcadia area and have been looking for new restaurants to try out. We ordered to go over the phone, the hostess was so polite and adorable! It only took 10 minutes  and the food was bomb dot com. Big quantities of food, leftovers for days and not that expensive, average price for good dine in Chinese food. Still not as good as my favorite Chinese food place off of Bethany and 16th st though. We got kung pao shrimp, house special chicken and bo bo platter for one, which was about $27 plus tip. We will definitely be coming back!

Best pizza I've ever tasted. I love it! The wings are okay, I mostly go there for the pizza. The lunch special is such a deal!! 2 giant slices with 1 or 2 toppings I think and a drink for less than $5. Service is always great, very nice employees and owners. It maybe a tiny hole in the wall pizza joint but it's to die for.

Food is great!! Prompt customer service, a little pushy but they are on it. My glass was never empty and food is prepared perfectly everytime. Never any undercooked mushy rice. The house chicken is crispy and the sauce is not like any other house sauce. The sizzling rice soup is what got me hooked. It's full of flavor, egg drop, pork, shrimp, chicken, water chestnuts, veggies, and the rice.

Will not be coming back here, waste of time. The owner was very nice and welcoming but that didn't make up for the quality of service. Started with the deluxe pedicure for a decent price. The water was cold. When I go for a pedicure I mostly go for the massage, I usually pay for extra massage if needed. She was pretty much just putting lotion and the sea salt on my legs and feet. No massage or rubbing what so ever. I asked her if she could rub harder or more rough. She either didn't understand or did not want to because she just told me no and shook her head. Complete waste of time, I did not see a point since I can put lotion on my legs myself.. Also painted my toes poorly with excess polish on my skin. When it came to get my gels replaced I presented a design I just wanted something similar. He did well on the design yet painted very poorly missing the sides of my nails and the gel is not thick enough and bumpy. My nails can chip or break very easily. All in all I'm never going back there. I only came there because my usual place is closed Mondays. Tiffiany's Nails, they are great.

Pretty nice despite the location. Very quick to get me in a seat and get started. Not to welcoming though. Presented a nail design and they did everything they could to match it for me. Also did a good job trying to match my gel polish color to my regular polish color for my toes. Did a great job with the gel, very thick and covered entire nail. Lasted a long time, about 2 1/2 weeks maybe. The pedicure was one of the best I've ever had! The had many options for the pedicure. You could pick what you wanted at decent prices. I get pedicures for the massaging. Longest massage I have ever gotten without paying extra. With both the sea salt and lotion. It was amazing and just the right amount of pressure. Did a nice job painting my toes as well. They were a little mad I didn't have cash for a tip though, I never carry cash. I will definitely be coming back here!

I've been coming back to this nail salon since I wrote this review a couple years ago. I have moved away from this area, but I still make the drive to come here to see Ronnie. His skills are amazing! I won't go to anyone else to do my nails.

Service was great, very friendly and polite. However I did not enjoy the food. This was my first time here, just moved to Tempe from Phoenix and noticed there are very little Chinese food places here. Saw all the great reviews online for this place, so came here. Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I don't know how you can mess up or make bad Chinese food.. it's so simple. If you want extremely over fried/cooked, tasteless, raunchy food, come here. So disappointing, at least it was cheap. You get what you pay for! yet I've had 10 times better Chinese food around the same price. Chinese food in Tempe is weak, I will not be coming back here. To Phoenix I go for good Chinese food!

Disgusting all around!!! You get what you pay for here. Filthy tables and dishes. Unsanitary food and drink handling. I'm surprised this place hasn't been shut down for to many health code violations. My college had told me this place used to be amazing but all of sudden went way way way down hill, he was completely right. I would not recommend this place to anyone.  However the hostess was very nice and polite. But do not come here, there's plenty of good Thai food places around. I'm scared I'm going to have food poisoning.

Wing stop is delicious! The chicken is always cooked perfectly and super crispy. This wing stop in particular is very stingy with their wing sauces though. A lot of the time there just isn't enough sauce making the chicken some what bland depending what flavor. The French fries are seasoned very good, yet are disgusting due to the lack of crisp or crunch. They are extremely soggy and mushy. Even when asked to make them extra crispy they fail and are just as soft. I go to this location a lot because it's the closet to me, I haven't had such issues at other locations. The customer service here is alright, nothing great. The employees look very sad or like they don't want to be there. And there are often little mistakes such as forgetting the drinks, side sauces, incorrect change back, and wrong type of wings (boneless or bone in). Overall wing stop is great with their chicken, just this location makes me second guess since all the aspects besides the chicken are poor.

First time to PF Chang's, very busy for a week night. We waited about 30 minutes which is totally fine for how busy they were. The waitress was very nice and polite, we ordered our food and someone else brought it out to us... Not to sound picky but I hate brown rice and so did my boyfriend. But they gave us brown rice. We asked for white rice and they said they were out, then said they are making some. So we said we would wait. Like wouldn't they think to just wait the 10 minutes for the rice to bring out everything else?! That makes the most sense to me.. Anyway he walked away and gave us no extra plates to put food on and no silver wear. And our waitress was no where to be found. When she finally came by about 10 minutes later we told her what was going on and she was clueless. Took the brown rice back and came back with the same brown rice, while our food has been sitting on the table for about 15 minutes now all cold along with the brown rice. Also the plates she brought us were filthy! Had brown sticky chunky disgusting left overs on them. At this point like what the hell. They weren't even busy anymore. I almost wanted to leave. She took our plates back to be heated up and we saw white rice coming to other tables so we told her and finally got some with our now warm food. Also we saw many plates being brought back to the kitchen at the tables around us. Kitchen was messing up hard. We got there at about 720pm and left at 9pm... Not that the service was bad, but just clueless and they did not communicate with one another. There was no point in talking to the guy who brought us out food. With the cooks, I don't know what the hell was going on back there. How does an Asian restaurant run out of rice. That's like a bowling rink being out of bowling balls.

Awlful service. If you are planning on coming here better give yourself at least 2 hours of waiting time. Unbelievable. Even just to drop off equipment. There's about 2 to 3 people working at a time and about 15 people in line waiting usually. Other cox stores are not like this. Save your time and go to another store.

By far one of the best burgers I've ever had! Beats smash burger, five guys, culvers, and even in and out which I love. The onions and cheese blend with bacon is so mouth watering, and the fries are perfect. Also good choice of ice tea. Service is great as well for a fast food joint, employees are very nice and smiley.

First time here. Service was awful and slow af, on a Thursday night at around 9 pm. There was hardly anyone there so it's not like they were busy. The bartender was a stuck up, rude, hipster, bitch. Like come on, smile, fake it, and work for your damn tips. I wondered how the hell she even got hired. It was my friend's and I's first time and we met a group of 4 people there who had already racked up a bill of at least $75. They also said she had been rude all night to them as well, ignoring them and rolling her eyes at every little thing. I wanted to slap the attitude right off her face. We were so nice, polite and patient with her, for her to be treating us like shit. After ordering our drinks, which took 10-15 minutes with a bar that only had 5 people at, we closed our tabs immediately and moved to a big table hoping to be served by waitress instead. But there was no waitress to be seen, my friend went up to the hostess after about 20 minutes of sitting there, then she sent someone over to us. She was nice but kind of an airhead. She brought the food to us and there was a long black hair on the pizza. Sent it back and got another one, it was delicious. Also the beer I was drinking was wonderful, my friends enjoyed their beers as well. Yet it was $9.65 for the smallest glass of beer I've ever seen.. I want to come back here for the beer and food but that horrible service is really stopping me, I don't think I'll ever be coming back. Unless you want terrible, slow, rude employees to wait on you, hair in your food, and over priced delicious food and beer come here.
