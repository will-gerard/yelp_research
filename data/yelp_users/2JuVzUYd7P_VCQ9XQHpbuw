I have been going here for years! But I only get pedicures as I rarely get my hands done. En is my favorite tech, she does the best job on my caluses and my feet are always silky smooth. I ask for her personally whenever I go. Tammie is great also, and she does an awesome job on waxes, my daughter loves her. The place is clean. They are friendly and accommodating when they can. Your best bet is to make an appt, as they can get booked fast during busy times it during event seasons.

Hard to write too much of a review when all you had are fries and wine, but the fries are da bomb!!! And the wine rocked too!  Thank you Jeff the bartender for taking good care of us!

I expected this place to be more expensive than out usual steakhouse, and I wasn't disappointed.  Overpriced for what we got, totally so. Service was mediocre, though the waitress did write the name of my wine for me on a business card so I could find a bottle later. We saw nothing in the entrees that was appealing enough for the price, so we had French Onion soup, outstanding, and shared a baked mac n cheese with lobster ($18!!!!!) which was ridiculously small.  Bread served was a bland sourdough, with tasteless butter, should be salted, and per waitress it is a Vermont cheddar butter.....no cheddar detected by us. My wine, Sivas Sonoma, was the only shining star, excellent for the 9$.  Recommend you take you money to Ruth's Chris instead, or at least make reservations so they seat you in the dining room and not the bar.

Best coffee! Easy to give Starbucks a kick in the pants!  This place has great ambience, great service, great coffee and conveniently located near CGCC and the freeway.  Also makes a great place to "work" away from home!

I've been here twice and they made a very competent Mocha.  But I was disappointed to see the liquor license application sign in the window, especially for a "coffee shop".

So so, Tokyo Joes is much better. Beef n broccoli bowl was about half full compared to my Singapore Cashew, which was a full bowl, we both got regular size. Peanut sauce was lacking peanut flavor, for a bit I thought I had teriyaki, though it was really good. Beef was a bit tough. Might go back again to try something else.

Not bad, not spectacular, but okay burger place.  The best part was the sauce bar, Thai ketchup and chipotle mayo were awesome.  Some of the sauces are gluten free too, and they have a gluten free menu.  I had gluten free Shroom burger, good burger and mushrooms, but gluten free bun was awful, crumbly and dry, no flavor.  Need a new supplier for their gluten free buns, there MUST be better ones than that!  Fries were average, skinny, crisp, good fluffy inside though.  Tables clean, they came to clear our empty baskets quickly.  Water bottles at 2$ are a rip off. I mean come on, really?

Been here a few times now.  Have had a great cortado, and their mocha latte was awesome with real chocolate in it, not a syrup, not a powder, deep rich chocolate flavor to balance with the coffee.  And their pastries from Pistol Whipped are the bomb!!
