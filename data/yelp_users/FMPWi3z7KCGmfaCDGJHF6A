I love working out at Pure Fitness Scottsdale. Everyone is always very helpful, and is willing to give advice when asked.  One thing I really enjoy, is my monthly re-program, where I meet with a trainer and see where I stand compared to the month before.   In the past year I have worked with several different trainers, and they have all been very knowledgeable. I am currently working out with Elizabeth and she is the best!!!  The class selection is decent, and I rarely miss the Tuesday night ab class.  For parents- they do have an on-site daycare, so you can bring your kids to the gym worry free.   Edit: Since writing this review I have switched clubs. I no longer work-out at the Scottsdale club due to a change in staff. As I no longer workout here, and was not happy when I left. I am changing my rating. Nothing personal, but that is how I felt when I left.

First of all I love that everyone knows my name. IT adds to the special factor. I get waxing services done with Viktoria. She is THE BEST. Everyone needs to go see her. I ALWAYS get compliments on my eyebrows.   Ashlee cuts my hair and does my color. She is also very good. She did my color before a major event last year, and I received lots of compliments. Cut-wise, I've only gotten trims and bags, but no complaints.

I went to Greene House with my sister for dinner on a Friday night. It was busy, but not super busy.    We waited ten minutes before a server acknowledged us. We didn't even get an eye contact and "I'll be right with you," when one of the three waiters that walked by our table.   This really put us in a funk because we had been really looking forward to eating here.   When our food came, my drink glass was empty, and our waiter set down our food and walked off. I thought he would come back, but I had to ask another waiter to get me a refill.   My sister got the turkey with hummus on pita, and felt it was way over priced for what she got. Same with my sandwich, it was decent, but I've had better. The best part of our meal was the salad dressing that came on our side salads.   I am a big fan of other Fox Concept restaurants (Blanco, North) and this just left me really disappointed.

MY FAVORITE LUNCH PLACE!!!!  Funny enough my dad introduced me to the beauty that is Essence.  I could eat there every day of the week.   The Greek Caesar salad is SO good. Sometimes I get it with Chicken.   One Friday, we got there early enough for breakfast before work. I had the breakfast sandwich  and potato cake. The brioche bread is heavenly. MY sister had the french toast. Also heavenly. The banana-caramel sauce...mmm mmm mmm.  There is nothing that I Have tried here that is NOT good.  I am very picky about my spanakopita and tzatziki sauce. Essence def ranks among my favorites. I scour their weekly specials and make my lunch plans for the week depending on if Essence has a meal with tzatziki!  If you work in Tempe- this is a MUST for lunch!

One word. Poutine. Best thing ever. I was beyond excited when I saw D'arcy had poutine on the menu. I would go back just for that...

We went to Escape for a girls' night out. I love DC Ranch, and I hate that it's gotten so blah over the past few years. We ordered a cheese plate for our appetizer (brie, cheddar, mozzarella) and it came with a plate of crackers, grapes and delicious strawberries.   Food- We all got something different, to really get a feel for the menu. The gyro was a little crispy, but tasty. The chicken skewers were extremely flavorful and good and the salmon w/asparagus was also tasty.      Being Greek, I am extremely picky- the tzatziki passed the Greek test. It was just the right amount of garlic, but not that over-powering garlicy taste.  The drinks- we should have each tried something different, but we didn't. We tried their white cosmos, and were satisfied enough for a second round (minus the dd cause they were pretty strong).  Service was friendly, but like the others said, it was kind quiet. It was missing that old DC Ranch busy feel.  Next time we are going to go a little later and scope out the "nightlife" portion of Escape and just go for drinks & dancing.

I LOVE going to Desert Nail Spa for pedis! Kim and Karen are my two fave nail techs,  and everyone there is friendly :)  I only wish they were open a little later at least once a week.

I have been trying to write this review for a few months now and it is so hard to put it all into writing.  Zone has changed my life. When I started in October, my confidence level was low, I carried an extra 39 pounds, and honestly I was skeptical. How could this place differ from everything else I had already tried? I signed  up for my first "Get Fit Challenge" in October and was quickly SHOWN how different this was.   First and foremost, Heather and Chase are absolutely incredible. They take the time to cater to each and every individual. Need a modification because of pain issues? They will show you an alternate exercise. Hit a plateau on the diet? They will sit and look at your food intake and show you were you can tweak your meals. They cheer you on and show you that you can do anything you set your mind do, you just need to TRY.   The people. Your ZAP classmates become like family. Like Monica said, every class is so different as far as personality and tempo. (Shoutout to my 7 AM & 6:15 PM friends!) The support and encouragement you get from other members also adds to the amazingness of this gym. During a fitness challenge, you will always hear people asking others about how their weigh-in went and both encouraging and congratulating them. In addition to you classmates, the entire ZONE staff is incredible.     Nine months ago, I would say "I can't do this" with exercises before I even tried. Now, I try. My confidence level has risen and I've really learned you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to with the right tools.  Best gym in the world!
