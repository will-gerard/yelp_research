I just had a wonderful experience at this Target.  They say it's the attitude of employees that make a good company and they're right!  The girl that rung me up at the checkout stand was genuinely kind, sweet, interested in the fun I had this weekend, and well, just great!  She was such a wonderful woman that I didn't even notice at first that she hardly had any use of the right side of her body.  Knowing that this Target was willing to hire a disabled person is a big plus for me, and what a wonderful person they got!  Two thumbs up for this great shopping experience!

So, my car had been vibrating for about a week and I thought I needed an alignment so I took it to the nearest place I could find that did alignments, after price checking around.  Turns out their prices are about average for that kind of thing so I went to them.   After they looked it over they said my steering gear assembly was bad and that my tires were moving almost 4 inches independently of one another!  Because of this the alignment wouldn't be any good until I got it fixed.  They also said my front 2 tires were bad and needed to be replaced (which was true, I knew that for a while).  Safe to say, I was scared for my car!  They quoted me $921.60 for everything. Luckily I never do anything without a second opinion so I dropped in on my family mechanic, Bill at Black Canyon Automotive, in North Phoenix while I was in the neighborhood the next day.  He put it on the lift, he brought me under the car with him and he pointed out that there was nothing wrong with the steering gear, the tires were moving perfectly with one another, and an alignment wasn't the issue.  The vibration was from a bubble in my front driver side tire because one of the tires belts was broken.  I went to Discount Tire, got 2 new tires, and all was well for only $200! Thinking back I realize how bold faced the lie Purcell's fed me was.  I mean, if my tires were moving 4 inches independently of one another the car couldn't make it out of the parking lot, forget about slight vibrations over 65MPH! These guys are liars and crack pots!  Avoid them!

3 times now I've had other mechanics quote me outrageous bids on things that made me feel like I was driving a worthless lemon, and 3 times I've taken my car all the way to north phoenix to get a second opinion from my good ol' family mechanic Bill, at Black Canyon Automotive and he's put the lie to what the other mechanics told me.  He's saved me thousands of dollars on unnecessary repairs!  He's always completely honest with me, even though that sometimes means I'll be leaving his shop without him making a dime off me.  My entire family goes to him and loves him.   I'm never going to waste my time with anyone else ever again!  He's worth the drive for me.  If I ever moved even as far away as prescott, I'd still drive down to have him do my car work if my car could make it that far.  He's the best!

I love that there is a locals place right within walking distance of my apartment.  I've been drinking there for a couple weeks now and I love the good beer and cheap prices.  I just ate there for the first time last night and the chicken sandwich and curly fries are delicious.  The service is reasonable, the atmosphere is friendly, and the patio makes for a great hang out.

I love this place!  I've been diving head first into sewing for a few months now.  The ladies there all know me and are very friendly.   It's like a treasure hunt every time I go.  The fabrics are fairly organized by type but you never know what you might find.  I highly recommend hunting the whole store when you go just to make sure you don't miss something new and exciting!

The girls working the desk were very nice, loving, friendly women.  If the doctors treated me this well I may have liked the place.  Unfortunately I had the honor of meeting both of the doctors.  They missed a very good calling as used car salesmen.  They're caring tone of voice was plastered on with a trowel.  They kept building up my problems to make them sound worse so I would feel a need to buy their $1,700 two month treatment plan.  But if I buy today I'll only have to pay $1,500!  Even how they read the X-ray seemed off to me "See how the spaces between these vertebrae are smaller".  Those spaces looked the same, or even bigger to me.   "I looked over your chart VERY carefully' they both said.  Ya, with what time?  The 4 minutes you've had me locked in this tiny room alone? All I want is a Chiropractor who will spend more than 3 minutes at a time in the room with me.  I used to be a sales man.  I know that game and they were laying it on thick.  If they've spent this much time perfecting their selling script, I wonder how much time they actually spent helping people.   In the end, I opted for only one treatment instead of the $1,500 package.  The 'Treatment' was 2 twists of my spine, very similar to the kinds my friends down at the bar give me.  I guess without a $1,500 investment they just want you in and out as fast as possible.   I've been going to chiropractors my entire life, I've been adjusted thousands of times, and this was the biggest crock I've seen yet.

My hard drive took a dump.  I had my entire life on that drive and nothing backed up.  All my photos from my 4 month cross country road trip, all my business information, my website stuff, everything!  Data Doctors quoted me "Between $750 and $1,500 depending on what's wrong with it".  Red Seven saved my life for under $300 dollars!   They were professional and friendly.  I definitely will recommend everyone to them!

My favorite place to go in Scottsdale!   They are laid back and friendly.  The bar tenders and even the owner introduce themselves by name when you talk with them!  The music is very different every night so check the website or call first if there's something specific you're looking for. I just like that I can go to a place in Scottsdale and not have to worry about dress code, I can dance on their nice dance floor which is almost never overcrowded (totally awesome because I really like to move!), the drink prices are about the same as anywhere but every so often the owner or one of the tenders has come up and bought me a round!  Or if I tip well they'll sometimes give me a free shot.  So they are totally friendly and nice there.   Good mix of live music and DJ depending on the night.  Over all I am very happy with this place  =)

This studio is the top of the line in education and they offer many unique programs you can't find anywhere else! Their store is also a completely original thing of beauty!  You're find original and hand made clothing and products that are not available anywhere else!  Great place!

This place was great!  It was a lot larger than I thought it would be.  I was looking for 'wax sand' to make colorful candles with.  I've always thought of Hobby Lobby as the kind of place you go for model rocket parts or something so I went to Michael's first.  Their wax selection stank.  So I came to Hobby Lobby and they had exactly what I was looking for!  They had the wax sand in a bunch of colors (some colors weren't as bright as I was hoping for, but over all a good selection) and it was a lot cheaper than I thought it would be.  Michael's was asking $7 for a bag of white wax half the size of the colored wax I got here for $3!  I was able to get twice as much as I thought I was going to!  My roommate's kids are going to love doing this project!

I've been going to these guys for over a year now and now after exploring many of the other E Cig stores in town I can say with confidence, they are the best!   They have great flavors, huge selection of liquids and e cigs, they are VERY knowledgeable, they have awesome deals for there frequent customers, and they treat you like family!  They now have a few different locations around the valley as well!  They are amazing!  I drive WAY out of my way to go to there store instead of the store right down the street from me.   Shop there, you'll love them!   One suggestion, they get really busy during certain times of the day, try to go when they aren't to busy so you can have the REAL Butt Out experience, and not the busy one  =)
