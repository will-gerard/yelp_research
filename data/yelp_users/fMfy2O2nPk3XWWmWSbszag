This is the place to get fantastic and fast mexican food.  The shrimp tacos and the shrimp burrito are amazing.  Very causal, I usually just get take out and enjoy the food at home since the place is so small.

I went for lunch and it was very good.  The reason why it isn't 5 stars is because the selection was limited.  Definitely a place to go for lunch.  :)

This is my favorite place to get thai and I have not found a place to rival it.  Now it's not perfect.  I got on a regular basis (they know me when I walk in now... I go that much).  The service is either great or slow, and the heat ratings varies enough that you can be surprised.  The decor isn't fancy and it's hard to find from the street.  Now that being said, the food is always great and across multiple dishes on the menu.  I'm always satisfied with my lunch.    It gets busy every week day during lunch because of the Intel crowd so show up before noon.  For dinner and the weekends, it's never that busy, so a great time to go if you have time.

Sure the neighbor is a little rough, and I might worry about where I park my car.  Also, the food here isn't completely healthy for you, and might be a days worth of calories in one meal.... but it's totally worth it.  This is one of those places that I go to once a year, to pig out on fantastic soul food.  I always order the standard friend chicken with waffles, mac and cheese and collard greens.  The sides are kinda pricey, but good to share with someone.  Even though they look small, you'll be so full from the actual meal, it wouldn't matter.  Good mix, hot sauce with the maple syrup and the chicken, you gotta try it.  The place is small, but it has a nice atmosphere, with books and magazines scattered around to read while you wait.  It's a cozy place, great for a nice outing out with a friend.

This is by far my favorite sushi place.  The atmosphere feels more family run.  You never have to wait for a table, and they have $20 all you can eat.  The selection on the all you can eat menu is extensive, and I'm always satisfied.  The wait staff is friendly, but it can get a little slow if there are too many people at the table.  I find if more than 2 people are sharing an all you can eat menu then it's iffy if everyone at the table will be eating at the same time.

This is a great location for a romantic date that is "just drinks" ;).  It's dark, with couches (if you request them I think...) and a fantastic binder of wine.  For any wino, you would be a kid in a candy store.  It can be a little pricey and loud if there is live music.  Also because it's so dark, might be hard to go with a large group since you can't see everyone well haha.  It's hard to find, the entrance isn't actually facing the street.  you have to walk around the building to the back.

I have been here for dinner twice and both times I'm completely satisfied with my meal.  The food: Of course I got the chopped salad.  It's just fantastic, and I wish I lived closer to Scottsdale so that I could eat it on a regular basis (note to self: try to make my own at home....).  My entre was the filet (I got it both times I was there) and both times it was perfectly cooked.  For desert I shared the peanut butter brownie.  It was apparently voted the best desert of 2010 by Phoenix Magazine, but I wasn't overly impressed by it.  It was good, but not the best.  (the chopped salad would make a great desert)  Trying to get a table: the first time we had reservations, and no issues sitting a group of 9.  The second time, a Tuesday night this year, I failed to make a reservation because I didn't think it would be busy... it was a Tuesday night after all.  Well I had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  We finally got seated at 8pm.  So lesson learned, no matter what day of the week, just make a reservation... and get the chopped salad no matter what!  8.9.12 - Figured I should add more to my review.... I still love this restaurant and it is still my absolute favorite place to eat in Scottsdale.  My friends and I went here recently with an out of town guest.  Of course I got the chopped salad to start out with (sharing with a friend).  Still fantastic and a requirement if you ever go.  For dinner I had the pork chop.  I generally don't order pork chops and didn't really grow up eating them... whenever I had one before it was bland and dry.  Cowboy Ciao though made the best pork chop of my life.  A month later I'm still craving it.  It was about half an inch thick, perfectly cooked and juicy.  Amazing.  For desert we ordered a bunch of items.  The cobbler and the donuts were great and I ordered the ice cream sampler.  The flavors I chose were duck fat buttercream, smoked chocolate, and spicy caramel.  I think I was the only one who liked the smoked chocolate, but I also love the taste of liquid smoke.  The duck fat was the most unusual and the least favorite.  Left a weird after taste.  The caramel was good, but not spicy enough.  Also, we ordered this cocktail that had a deviled egg as a garnish.  Amazing.  Just order it.

The reason I rated this so low is because I can never just get a table here.  It's always busy, it's cramped, and loud.  Sure the beer is great, and the food too... but it's never just easy to eat here.  Parking on the street stinks, and then waiting a half hour for a table is frustrating when there is no room for you to stand anywhere.  Otherwise, sure it's a fine bar.. but there are other bars in Tempe.

Oh Biancos.  This isn't really a restaurant you can just say "hey, lets go get a quick bite to eat".  This is a commitment of time.  There are other pizza places in Phoenix, with perfectly good food.  Biancos though, it's more of an experience.  Expect to spend at least 4 hours here.  1 ish hours waiting to get on the list, and then 2ish hours waiting to get into the restaurant, then an hour of eating.  Why would you want to do that?!  Well, because it's fun.  Make sure you go with a group of people you can have great conversations with.  Go when the weather is fantastic, and make sure you want to have some fun.  I always enjoy waiting in line with a glass of wine from Bar Bianco, which is next door.  You can start your tab over there, and carry it over to the restaurant when you are seated.  After you get on the list, the bar will also keep track of you and inform you when the restaurant is ready for you.  Biancos is located in a quiet, great little section of PHX where there is actual grass and trees.  So waiting will be in a park, where you can stand around and chat with friends and strangers.  I always find myself, and my party chatting it up with the other people in line... we all know we are going to be there for a while, so might as well socialize.    The food is always amazing.  I've gone several times and have tried most of the menu.  My one bit of advice, always get fresh basil on your pizza.  It's an extra cost, but makes a world of difference, no matter what pizza you get.  The Margarita pizza is still my favorite of them all, it's perfection.  Just go, expect to wait, and try to make the best of it.  It'll be a great time with friends, with wine, pizza, fresh air, and that basil.  :)

So..... yeah.... this happened  As you can tell by the price rating on Durant's, this is not a cheap restaurant.  It is one of the most expensive dinners I've had while in Phoenix.  So when I'm going to dine at a restaurant when my bill will be $100+ I expect excellent service, close to military type precision, and Durant's doesn't have it.  Overall Service: Our waiters were sporadic when checking in on us, there were several times when we had to catch anyone just to tell them to get our waiter because we wanted either a new drink or to even order our dinner.  The our table wasn't even cleared enough either!  Empty plates and glasses were just left on our table, making it crowded after a while.  It became a running joke with my friends how bad the service was.  Such a shame.  Bread Service: There was a small round of bread that was actually really yummy with spinach, onions and olive oil.  Not enough though, and wasn't refilled to the table till the end of the meal (yeah exactly).  Also we were served a small plate of some random veggies with a ranch dipping sauce.  The presentation could have been better.    Drinks: When we ordered wine, the serving experience was special... The wine glasses and flights (both empty) were delivered first and then eventually the waiter brought the bottles of wine to pour into our flights, then pour wine from the flight into our glasses.  The staff really needs to be retrained on how to serve wine...  Wine was split while pouring my flight and i had to ask for a new napkin since mine was soaked in wine.  Mid-point into the dinner we got tired of waiting for the servers so we just went to the bar to get our drinks.  Appetizers:  We got the calamari, chicken livers, and crab cake.  The calamari, the cheapest appetizer at $10 was fine, nothing special.  Chicken livers were dry and with no dipping sauce.  Crab cake was my favorite and I would order this again if I ever find myself back here, for some unknown reason.  Dinner: The stakes were good.  Didn't really rock my world considering the price, but they were good.  They come with a salad and a starch side.  For the salad, make sure to ask for the dressing on the side, my friend's salads were drenched.  The prices ranged from $30 (8 oz prime rib) - $200 for the steak dinners (that cut came with two lobster tails), fyi.  Dessert: We ordered the chocolate temptation cake, the brownie, and the creme brulee.  They got our order wrong so we got a free key lime pie also.  They were all fine, again, nothing that was fantastic.  There was a chocolate creme brulee but didn't actually look like a brulee, more like a mousse, and it was grainy, like the chocolate wasn't mixed properly.  If this was a cheaper restaurant, my rating would be higher.  The size of the bill really make my expectations higher, and Durant's didn't meet them.  I doubt we'll ever go back.  Also, P.s. I don't think there was a handicap woman's stall in the bathroom.  I didn't realize it till later, but I find it unusual to not have one in this day in age.  So fyi.

I will join the troves of people writing reviews for Cibo.  By now, it's known that it one of the best places to eat in Phoenix.    Cibo's atmosphere is the best by far.  Inside the "house" is quaint, and intimate.  Perfect for a romantic date for two.  The outside patio is lit well with stringed bulbs, great landscaping and the occasional live music.  The pizza is on par with Bianco.  I recommend getting a pie per person so you can try a variety.  Also, I usually prefer red pizzas, but the whites here at Cibo always end up being my favorite.  The crepe deserts, with fresh fruit and ice cream are beyond words.  Save room, you must get it.  I love brining out of towners here to show what Phoenix really has to offer.  Not some chain restaurant in a strip mall.

Obviously I've been here for breakfast.  I got the steak and eggs and I was amazed.  This amazement isn't from the steak or the eggs, even though they were both delicious, but it was with the toast.  I have never had such great toast before, and the jam was so fresh....  The wait was long, and we were there in July.  Limited shade outside, but at least they had a water jug for the people waiting.  I recommend preparing for the heat if you decide to go during the summer.

I really need to try more of the menu.   So far I've had the cocktails (yummy and strong), the anti-pasta plate and the hummas.  Everything has been fantastic.. the anti-pasta plate was solid, really great to order for an appetizer or just to snack on if you are going there for cocktails.  I will be going back again to explore more of the menu.

I'm only a fan because of the beer selection and location.  I'm a bit claustrophobic so I only like going to the lost leaf during off hours, when I can sit at a table, and drink my beer with friends comfortably while staring at the art of the walls.  They are one of the few bars that have my favorite Young's double chocolate milk stout available, so this it's a rare treat for me.  If you don't mind crowds then I recommend going whenever, but if you want a lighter night, then go during the week when there is live music playing.

This is my new favorite place for sandwiches.  The menu had such a variety, I was sad I could only eat one meal when I was there.  Everyone enjoyed their food, and they made special accommodations for a birthday desert.  I want to go back soon to try more on the menu.  They were very accommodating to our large party (about 18 people), the service was pleasant and quick.  The atmosphere was trendy but comfortable.  You should go for a nice cheap dinner.

The food was impressive.  The Fox Concept restaurants never seem to disappointment and North proved that again.  For starters we had the Zucchini chips, which were the most addictive things I've had in a long time.  I really wish I had a continuous filling bowl in front of me right now.  They were paper thin, and mildly breaded.    For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Whenever I try a new Italian restaurant I always gauge it on how well it makes this dish.  I was really impressed.  The waitress had informed me that the pasta is made in house daily.  The sauce was just light enough, and the meatballs were almost perfect.    It wasn't too busy when we went at 8:30/9pm on a Friday night, so the overall atmosphere was still nice.  I will really like to go back again and try more from the menu.

I really wish I lived in Downtown PHX so I could make Maizie's a regular brunch spot.  The $15 mimosa buckets are way too tempting.... actually, it's probably better I don't live near by.  We went on a Saturday morning while on a staycation in downtown (stayed at the Hotel Palomar).  We took the train up to Maizie's which was right near the stop, so convenient for out-of-towners!  It was a busy day at Maizie's but we were sat fairly quickly considering.  I had the turkey avocado eggs benedict for my main meal and then the table split the french toast for a "dessert".  Both were fantastic but I have to say that the french toast is by far my favorite french toast ever.  It was very sweet, so splitting it with a group of people was the best way to go about this.  It is actually made with french bread, which I don't think I've ever had it made like that before.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Brunch places that serve great cocktails are rare in PHX, but this is also just a great place to eat.

I love a great steak, medium rare but more rare than medium.  Eggs, can't live without.  I never thought I would like vegan food.  After eating here I have completely changed my mind.  The food is fresh and favorable.  The atmosphere is inviting.  The owner is pleasant, inviting and accommodating.  I had one of her cupcakes that had a raspberry on top, and a caprese sandwich.  Both were fantastic, and I just couldn't get enough.    This is also just a simple business, started up by this woman, and I want to see it succeed.  With such quality food, it should be a hit.  :)

I love a place that serves food till 2am, and asian inspired food to boot.  The quality is always fantastic, service is great and if you want to try a bunch of different sakes, they have a great list to try.  My favorite thing to eat is the miso soup.  It's huge, best to share with someone.  My favorite sake is called "Aladdin", it's unfiltered and a little fruity.  Best for groups who are comfortable sharing food, since this is a tapas restaurant.  The atmosphere also makes me forget that I'm in dowtown PHX, and not even a highly populated part either.  It's trendy, but comfortable.  It's one of my go-to places to eat in downtown.

One of my favorite, relaxed and trendy cocktail bars in PHX.  You must get the White Rabbit Cocktail, it's amazing.  There is some good people watching, and it's great for conversation with friends.  It's a small bar, so don't expect to find someplace to sit, even though there is plenty of seating, it's always a comfortable level of full.  :)

I just discovered this place today and it was really nice.  Very comfortable, and relaxed.  My friends and I sat and talked for 3 hours and it was very homey with cute couches and chairs.  The art was unique, and same with the decor.    I had the Margaretta, and I could easily tell it was fresh, with pulp in the drink.  Fantastic and only $5 with happy hour.  The guacamole was great quality, and very fresh.    I had the ahi tuna, shrimp and carne astada tacos, and they reminded me of this great place I found in Rocky Point.    I got a glimpse of the pool area and it looks very trendy and fun, I will be going back when the weather warms up.  Definitely a great place to go, relax, and eat quality food.

This is my go-to pizza place.  I'm from upstate NY (not NYC), but this is as close to home as I could find in AZ that delivers to my ahwatukee apartment.  There are other pizza places that I enjoy in the valley but the sauces really differentiate themselves.  I prefer this sauce since it's more like a tomato and minimal sweetness or spice.  The quality is always fantastic, friendly staff and nice variety.   - The pizza sizes are actually very large.  The "small" is about the same size as a dominos large, and the "x-large" is just huge. - Meatballs are large and filling as sides, you should get them.  2 comes with the order. - The wings are my favorite of the valley and they actually come with carrots and celery.  Also, blue cheese isn't something odd for this NY place, because if you are from NY you DON'T use ranch on wings.  Also the blue cheese is great and chunky like it should be.  Also, the sauce isn't thick, maybe a little oily, but I enjoy it.  I ask for my wings to be cooked crispy and they come out perfectly. - My family has also ordered the spaghetti dishes, and meatball subs.  Everyone was happy with the choices. - Garlic knots are fantastic also, order plenty.  :)  If you go to the actual restaurant they sell slices, and serve beer and wine.  Great for a date night because it's next door to the AMC movie theater (Ahwatukee 24).  The service is quick, so you can get a quick bite before the movie.  Sure it's more pricey than some chain restaurant, but the quality is great, and it's a family owned restaurant.  Something we should support here in the valley.

The atmosphere is moody and dark, which I'm a huge fan of.  There were comfy couches, and beautiful chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.  The appetizers were fantastic.  I had the tuna tartar, chicken wings, and the scallops.  Towards 11pm the bar started to get very crowded, but it is a small place, so it was much more comfortable when it was a little sparse.    I could come here again for a quick drink, but I wouldn't stay here the whole night.

I'm not a vegan, but I thoroughly enjoyed the tempeh bacon in my Lumberjack sandwich I had for brunch.  I got the side of potatoes with the pomegranate BBQ, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce.  I switched it out for the spicy "cheese" dipping sauce, much better.  It was a great breakfast, I'd def go back there again.

I would say this is my favorite place on Mill.  It's classier than a lot of the bars there, and I don't feel as old as I usually do in Tempe haha.  The atmosphere is classy, and trendy, perfect for some quiet cocktails with friends.  My favorite cocktail, grapefruit juice and tequila, was listed as one of the best tequila cocktails in Phoenix by AZ Central.com.  It's refreshing and light.

I have been to Tommy V's a couple times before and have always enjoyed my time there.  This past weekend I decided to celebrate my birthday with a large group of friends at Tommy V's, and the restaurant was fantastic to us.  They have a large room at the back of the restaurant for large groups, which is where we were seated on saturday.  I love the room because there is curtain that closes it off from the rest of the restaurant, which provides a nice level of privacy.  When I walked to my table, I noticed that they printed out personalized menus for me, wishing me happy birthday!  I have never had that done for me before, and it was such a great gesture, made it instantly special for me.  As always the food was fantastic, and all my friends enjoyed their meals.  The service though, was impeccable.  The waiter was charismatic, and accommodating to my friends, even going above and beyond to make us happy.  I highly recommend Tommy V's if you have a large group dinner, or want to celebrate a special event, you won't regret it.

Yes, the drinks are expensive.  They can take some time to make, and you can't order anything but what's on the menu.  And sure, it's a small place, you have to call the phone number to see if you can even get in.  I can understand why people aren't too excited about this place.  Why do I like it?  Because it's one of the rare places in Scottsdale, where you can have a unique cocktail, be able to actually have a conversation, and see the menu because there are actually lights on inside.  I'm only 27, but sometimes I get tired of the loud music, and having the bar so dark I can barely read the menu.  This is a nice change of pace from the typical scene and a great way to start the night.    The staff is friendly, the drinks were great, and I had a fun night talking with my friends.    Check it out, but don't expect it to be like any other bar.

An update.  We went back to Blue Hound for dinner instead of just getting appetizers.  When we went it was in September (yes I'm behind in my reviews).  As I'm writing this review, I went to re-check the menu to remember the specific name of the dish I got, and the whole menu has changed.  So take that in mind, maybe the food will be better if you go now, vs. the menu selection we had in September.   From what I remember, I was just generally unimpressed with what options we had to choose from and the food wasn't amazing.  That is why I decreased my rating.  The experience just made us cross this off the list of "great places to eat" in phx.  I don't think we'll be doing a whole trip down here for the food.    I am curious to see if the new menu would be more promising though....

This is a great new addition to downtown Phoenix.  It reminds me of a pool bar that you would find in Scottsdale, but with a completely different crowd.  Great location in the cityscape complex that allows for bar hoping, and has fantastic views of the US airways center and downtown.  The cocktail list is fun, and expected at $10 a drink.  Bar staff is polite and the bar food is from the blue hound kitchen, so it's great.  Can't wait to actually go when it's warm out.

This is my updated review.  I originally reviewed in February, and I have gone back to Angels Trumpet Ale House a couple times after that.  My second time was in the summer, I stopped in for some beers during art walk and I ordered the poutine again.  I was so thoroughly surprised about how much the dish improved.  It was absolutely fantastic and was even better than home (they put green onions on top which were a great addition).    The most recent trip was for lunch during the weekend.  We stopped by for lunch before hitting up a matinee at the Film Bar that is right across the street.  The patio was a great way to enjoy the weather and drink a couple beers.  I ordered a burger with an egg on top.  I was never so impressed with the presentation of the burger.  The bun had a since shine to it.  It came with a huge side of fries that are very good.  Because of these more recent experiences and the quality of the food, I have increased my rating.

My friends and I were walking around downtown Chandler trying to figure out where to eat.  I didn't know this was a new restaurant, but when we looked at the menu outside we decided to eat here.    It's a whiskey bar, country themed.  There weren't any really inexpensive drinks there, the cheapest was a $4.5 beer.  The cocktail menu was interesting, not cheap, but I enjoyed my Kentucky cream soda (with bourbon).    The menu was nice, it wasn't huge but it has enough variety that kept us from making a quick decision on what to get.  We all got burgers, but it was a tough decision, the sandwiches looked great also.  The burger was cooked perfectly to order, the bun was a bit flufly was tasty.  Nice change, roasted tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes on my burger.  The fries were solid, nice side.  We ordered a mac and cheese side to share.  It was fantastic.  Creamy (a little Velveeta like, but I like that sometimes) and with enough spice to make it interesting.    The service was pleasant and quick.  Our waitress was nicely attentive.    Live music was at 9pm.  The tables were pushed back to make a mini dance floor but we were able to keep our table, which gave us a nice front row view.  It was incredibly loud though.  Hard to handle right after dinner so we left after a couple songs.  The band was great, we just couldn't handle the noise.    I'd would go back to check out the other items on the menu for sure.  Nice addition to downtown.

I went to the Pig & Pickle for a dinner out with friends this past weekend.  We were a large group that was easily accommodated for by the staff.  There was plenty of seating in the restaurant, and a back area that made the large group setting more comfortable.    I shared several dishes with friends so I'll list them off with my opinion but as you can tell by my overall review I was very satisfied with my experience.  When my mid-western parents come to visit in a month I'm absolutely bringing them here for dinner.  The menu was fancy but the atmosphere was causal.   Important to know - the portion sizes are large, even on the starters.  I wasn't aware of this when I started ordering and as you can see from the list, I was very full after dinner even though I was sharing.  The same goes with the actual dinners and sandwiches, expect to take home leftovers if you aren't starving.  ...Smoked Salmon, tater tot, fennel, lemon crema - If you love smoked salmon, then this is the best thing to get.  It was light but savory.  The lemon crema really made it special.  I would absolutely get this again.    ...braised pork belly, yam puree, brussel sprouts slaw and blis maple - This is just fabulous if you want two slabs of pork fat.  I'm not complaining, because who doesn't love pork fat, but it was a bit heavy when paired with the other heavier dishes.  ...wood oven roasted bone marrow, crostini and onions - I think this was the smallest portion size of all the dishes but with the strongest flavor.  I've never had bone marrow before this dish so I can't say if it was good or not.  The presentation was great and I enjoyed the experience.  ...cool beets salad (name too long) - I love beets, and I loved this salad.  Without question I will order this again.  It was light and pleasant, a great start.  It isn't big enough for a solid meal, but great to split with someone and a small appetizer.  ...lamb dish that was a special from the chef - cooked very well, with a fishy taste.  Anchovies are part of the meal (in the sauce though, no actual visual fish) and they really over powered the dish.  I liked it but heavy, so when added with the bone marrow and the pork belly I was over run with heavy dishes.  ...Seared carrot cake - BEST CARROT CAKE EVER.  I don't typically like carrot cake.  I typically find it fine, good enough, nice with some cider and fall weather.  This though, was the best I've ever had.  The seared surface really make the texture fantastic.  It had a deep flavor and a nice light goat cheese frosting.  The serving size is large, share this with someone.  ...little elvis desert - I wasn't a huge fan of this one, I think the most disappointing thing I tried.  IT was a nice concept, the bacon was too disappointing though, realy should have been a thicker cut but looked more like a piece of bacon on a fast food burger.

I've been to the Hula's in downtown Phoenix several times but I only seem to order drinks there and eat someplace else.  I've always loved the atmosphere at Hula's and the cocktails so when the new location opened up in Scottsdale, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there before hitting the town.  The location is great and has a small, very small, private parking lot.  Be weary if you park there about backing out.  Seating was varied with some booth/table set ups, small 2 person tables, bar seating and high top "communal" or large group seating.  There were a couple parties going on and it was still comfy for everyone.  What we ordered: - Island Style Poke: about $14 on my bill (market price) with a side of wontons ($1) was just fantastic.  Loved it, almost didn't want to share it with my friend. - Seaweed Salad: $4 - great portion, great dressing, just great.  I will order there every time I'm there from now on. - Blackand Ahi Tuna Sandwhich with a mix of sweet potato fries and standard fries: I could not get enough of this sandwhich.  The bread choice was fantastic.  It was soft enough that made it easy to bite into the Ahi.  The seasoning was great, and the potatoes were perfect.   My friend got the Mango Chicken Caesar Salad:  It was a huge salad, with a chicken breast.  I haven't had blackened chicken in a while, so I was surprised that it was spicy.  Really tasty though, just FYI.  The waiter was attentive and the staff was really nice.  I would definitely come back for dinner again.

This place has a lot of rules: 1. You cannot wait inside if there are no seats available, even though when you go inside there is plenty of standing space near the ATM.  There is not standing at the bar, or around the tables. 2. If you have a party more than 4, and you want to split a check per what you ordered, this will not be accommodated.  You will have to split it evenly.  This got very awkward for my group of friends because we all ordered very different things.  Luckily some of our party had cash so the four of us that didn't could pay for what we bought. 3. They do not take reservations between 4 and 8pm 4. There is a $10 minimum for a card charge, but luckily the drinks are $9-11 dollars, so you should be ok.  I've been here twice.  Once was on a Thursday around 7pm.  We were told we couldn't have a reservation till after 8.  When I arrived at 7, the place was empty and luckily they sat us.  The second time was last Saturday (labor day weekend) and we were told it was a 2 hour wait for a cocktail... not dinner... so we went to another bar in cityscape.  So the first time I was able to actually get in was ok.  The drink menu is fun.  Tons of options and there was a fantastic graph on the back to help guide you if you wanted something exciting, sweet, traditional, or savory.  My cocktails were great, no complaints.  I was really excited to have a fun, new, cocktail place in phoenix so things were looking up.  The food menu has some left to be desired, but if you treat this as a place to get a drink vs. getting dinner, then you'll be fine.  The food was good though, just not a great variety.  1.  I had the patte with bread, very yummy. 2.  The Ramen Burger... well that was disappointing.  Yes, it says that there is a lot of sauce on it ("extra napkins"), but it really did over power the burger.  I could barely taste the beef or the ramen... really they acted like conduits for the sauce which wasn't that memorable.   3. My plain fries, a side that is separate, were really good.  I would like to have a cocktail and these fries every time I come here. 3.  The loaded friends looked really good and my friends enjoyed them  We all liked being there, and I wanted to go back and introduce other friends to bitter and twisted (hence last Saturday) but they just make it too hard.  Also considering there is the blue hound, arrogant butcher and squid ink in walking distance (all have great cocktails and food).  I will try to come back again, I just hope they accommodate customers a little better.

I am very late in writing my review which is a shame because this was one of the best meals I've ever had in Phoenix.  The seating is tight, it was very awkward waiting for our table in a walk way.  We were very much in the way of the wait staff and other patrons.  We had a large group and we were comfortably seated though.  What I ordered... what what I ordered is no longer on the menu... I'm actually really sad because the pasta I had was homemade flat noodles in a homemade apple sausage pieces in this sauce that was a dream.  I could not get enough of the sauce and I practically licked the plate dry (well as close to it since It is a nice place to eat and I tried to some some decency).  There was also this caramel rosemary cheese cake that was so fantastic that I was sad that no other cheesecakes could compare.  I've been writing this review while staring at the new menu that is published on their website.  I'm sure what is available now will be fantastic, I'm just also sad I can't go back and re-do this meal again.... it was that good.  I guess I will have to go back soon and try the new menu!
