Lopez Landscaping has done a great job on our backyard.  We have a 1/3 acre lot and quite a lot of yard in the back.   Our designer, Frank, listened to our inputs and came up with a great design.  We wanted to execute the design in phases as we could afford it and they have worked with us wonderfully.  All of the workers have been very professional, explaining everything as we went along.  Their office staff (Maria and Lisa) were very good about returning emails and phone calls.  The best part is that they are very affordable and back up all their work with a warranty.

Great ambiance... Great service... However, the food fell a little short... While the salmon was an excellent dish, the NY Strip fell short... The steak was dry and overcooked, and the shrimp were fishy and undercooked... For the price point, it was a bit disappointing...

Loved the pizza, the atmosphere, and the staff were extremely friendly. We will definitely make this our family spit for pizza
