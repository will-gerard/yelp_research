Awesome! Great atmosphere to hang out with friends and enjoy the view! Had a wonderful waitress and food was amazing! Had the lavosh I think it is called, was awesome! Never had anything like it before! Very enjoyable evening overall on the second floor patio! Would definitely return and recommend to others.  The only thing is I would go when the weather permits and it is cool outside. But, loved it!!

Waited 40 mins just for a table... Got seated at the only table that was open the entire time we waited. Took over an hour for food. Our waitress forgot to put in 2 of our parties meals. Never brought water, coffee, or checked in with our table for anything. Service was terrible. The manager ended up filling our waters and correcting our orders... Cool atmosphere too bad service was inadequate to say the least.... I would have given this place negative stars but Yelp won't let me!
