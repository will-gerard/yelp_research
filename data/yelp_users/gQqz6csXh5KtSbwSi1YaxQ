I have not had a single issue living here for almost a year now and I'm truly surprised there are any negative reviews. My guess is that only the tenants who have had minor issues or those who simply want to make a fuss over nothing have posted here. Probably what you can expect from typical Scottsdale residents.The staff is great (and I mean really great), location is awesome, outside area is clean, never had any bug problems. Any services I have needed I put a request in online and they are usually there the next day to fix/help with whatever I need (all minor things, never anything extreme). It's quiet, neighbors are friendly, amenities are wonderful. Very safe area. The buildings and outside areas/pools are maintained very nicely. This is a great place to live and location is perfect for restaurants, shopping, entertainment etc. Rent is definitely reasonable for the amount of space you get and quality of the apartment.The only thing you have to consider is the closed streets during the waste management Phoenix open..but that's only about a week out of the whole year and the leasing office supplies you with a parking pass to bypass all of that traffic. Other than that I say five stars! Highly recommend this place! Love it here!!

I was really excited about the concept of this place because as a night nurse it's really difficult to eat healthy and maintain my weight. So I purchased about a weeks worth of meals and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the food lacks flavor and two of the dishes gave me food poisoning :/ sad to say I won't be returning. I really wish I could find a place that makes healthy meals that taste good.
