I don't always eat tortas. But when I do, I prefer Los Reyes. Actually, I've never tried a torta before last night -- and to think, I used to call myself a cultured Mexican food aficionado.  This place is bomb, that's all there is to it. I had the pechuga asada torta (bomb), side of guacamole (so bomb), pineapple agua fresca (way bomb), and half of my girlfriend's estillo del rey quesadilla (SUPER BOMB). The guacamole was some of the best I've ever tasted, although I heard some complaints about an overload of cilantro. Man up, cilantro is awesome.  The prices were a little high from what I would expect out of a dinky little Mexican restaurant, but I guess after you're featured on Man vs. Food you're allowed to overcharge. Or if your food is this damn good.  The next time I go, I'm definitely going to scoop up a strawberry agua fresca -- I tried my friend's, and it was... you guessed it, turbo bomb. It's a little bit of a drive from North Scottsdale, but any man will drive a few extra miles for some good tacos.

I really want to give Dr. Levins five stars, because he's a superb doctor.   Without digging too far into my medical history, I've seen Dr. Levins for a number of conditions, including a handful of serious allergies that I hadn't suffered from until moving to Arizona. He's prescribed medication when needed and follows up with regular appointments to ensure that I am a healthy patient.  As my PCP, Dr. Levins has referred me to a number of specialists for my various injuries, illnesses, and other unnamed maladies, including: an allergist, a urologist, two physical therapists, a dermatologist, a radiologist and a medical clinic.  With regard to his bedside manner, Dr. Levins is second to none. Although he sees hundreds of patients per week, I always feel that he personally cares about my health.  I'm giving Dr. Levins a less-than-perfect rating solely because the reception in his office is mildly abominable, and unfortunately, that is not an exaggeration. I won't go on a tirade about how people in professional settings should put on their big boy and big girl pants and fake a smile in client-facing roles...  However, one receptionist in particular always seems to have a problem with the world and greets every patient with barely bridled contempt. It's really off-putting, and if I didn't like Dr. Levins so much I'd tell this lady to shove it out her ear.

I like not waiting for weights or equipment, I like being able to look at myself in the mirror, and I like being able to call for a spot while I'm in the middle of a PR to make sure I don't have to bail a lift.  Perks of this gym:       * Space: Traffic to the gym is relatively light, even at rush hour. And even when it's crowded, it's never bad enough where you're bumping up into other bros. Oh, and if you have a problem with bros at the gym--or any hilarious gym stereotype--get over it. Unless you're doing curls in the squat rack you're fine #goingturbro       * Diversity of Equipment: I've leaving this at five stars in spite of this gym lacking a true running track. I can't stand treadmills because you can't control your speed with only your legs, and that just isn't natural. Seriously, this kind of thing could save your life. If Independence were a man I'd slap him in the face for all the treadmills he owned, but as friends, because the running track in the back of the gym is enough for me. Running is the bane of my existence, and any more than a mile is likely preceded by a puff on the old inhaler, since most of my long distance running is outside and I happen to be allergic to palo verde. Having a short distance track for sprinting, skipping, spinning, and rolling is a must.       * Lifting, bro: There are two deadlift areas with powercages, and two additional squat racks. There are four barbell bench press stations, and one each of incline and decline. Then, there are a number of incline, decline and flat benches across the main free weight area, which is lined with a good number of dumbbells, up to 200+ pounds.       * Other stuff: Independence has everything from heavy bags and foam rollers to yoga mats and plyo boxes, hell they even have bosu balls, if you're into that kind of thing. I'm not aware of the class schedule (yoga, posing, some group fitness classes), but that's what their website is for. I think it's actually out-of-date; you get what you get. The men's bathrooms are decently equipped and maintained, and although the number of lockers is far fewer than what you'd expect at a bigger gym, there are always empty ones.  I'll keep going to Independence for as long as I live in the area. Despite my glowing review, I urge everyone to consider other gyms. I don't need a bunch of Yelpers crowding up my grunting space. Dost thou even hoist?

This review has been a long time coming. My lady and I hit up Butters on the regular, usually Saturdays or Sunday mornings. If you get there early enough, you can avoid waiting too long. There's a special time in the late morning, when all the early risers are leaving Butters, and all the good parking spots open up. You'll have to wait a few minutes longer, but it's worth the 20 less steps you'll have to take to get into the diner.  While you're waiting, you can order coffee-type beverages from the barista at the front. It's not the best, and I'd advise just waiting until you're seated to order the house blend.  The staff is obsessively attentive, but not annoyingly so. They zoom in with coffee -- iced during the summer, of course -- and take our orders, which arrive within 5-6 minutes, without fail. I fear that they have developed some nanosynthesis food production technology. Or maybe they're just really good at being a diner.  I'm the kind of guy that has a "usual" at restaurants. Butters is no exception. I'll get three eggs poached, bacon, hashbrowns and protein pancakes. When I'm feeling unusual, I'll opt for one of their skillets or omelets. Whatever you get here, you're going to love it. My girlfriend gets the berry bliss or strawberry cheesecake french toasts, which I am more than happy to partake in. I never leave Butters feeling underfed or unsatisfied.  I've never ordered from their lunch menu, so I can't offer my opinion on it. I'm not curious enough to find out. Butters isn't my "lunch" place, and I hate change.

So this may in fact be the worst Chipotle in existence. Let me explain.  Every time I show up craving a burrito bowl, there's a huge line to the door. Each person in line is wondering why they're there. You can tell. They're wondering why they put up with the low quality, the terrible service, the indifferent management, the unacceptable price of guacamole, the attitudes of the guy asking you what you want -- or more often, telling you to hold on. The only time I've come here and not had to wait in line, this troll still told me I had to wait because they were making an order for a  family (not in attendance).  I've checked in to this place a few times, and I've been to the Chipotle by Fashion Square a few thousand. For some reason, that place is bomb and this place sucks. At this location, you have to stand in line among dine-in patrons and witness the slop that you're about to ingest and the looks of disappointment on their faces after each unfulfilling bite.  If you've already decided to eat at Chipotle, you've probably had Chipotle before. If you're like me, you go to get a burrito bowl with no rice because you're a Slow Carb or 4 Hour Body fanatic. You know that you can get what you need (not necessarily what you want). If you want a delicious authentic Mexican meal, go across the street to Julio's. If you want to hate yourself and write a whiny Yelp review about it, come here.
