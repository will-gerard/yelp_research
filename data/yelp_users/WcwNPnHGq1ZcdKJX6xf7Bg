Do not sign up if you ever want to cancel. They will tell you that you can "just come in to cancel" when you show up a manager must be present. But they only work 9-5 Monday through Friday. How convenient for working folk. They then give you a form to take home tape up and buy a stamp to mail to there headquarters to cancel where they get a chance to bill an additional month. It's a SCAM. Spend your money at a crossfire center or coed sports league.

Here is the deal with this place. I go here about 3 times a month. It's owned by a small korean family. the rolls are average per most sushi joints. But the fish here is by far fresher then anything at RA, Kona, or Sakitini. for 21.95 at lunch and 24.95 at dinner its all you can eat. They do use a little more rice than most other places unless you are a regular. For better service, better portions become a regular here and make yourself known with the chefs. I like places like Kona, RA , Sakitini but when I get the bill I feel raped I usually rack up a $65-$90 at those places but here I can go more frequently and not have to shell out as mush cash. Don't expect this to be some upscale joint it's not its for average family's. Not for the Shi Shi peeps of the valley.

I'll be honest I was not impressed with the food. Very in seasoned and greasy. Service was slow. I also received a dirty water glass and silverware. This was my first and last visit. I give it 2 stars because the cost is low.

The absolute best thing about this place is I can go here after work because they are open till 2AM. They are big fans of putting lots of sauce on your rolls. so if you order any rolls with sauces expect a lot more than usual. The rolls here are wrapped smaller and tighter than most but the rolls are much longer. I enjoy this place but really only go here during the late night happy hour. because the specialty rolls are about 17-24 bucks and i would much rather pay a third of the cost. the only thing I don't really like is the high price and the slow waitress. I cant really say anything bad about the food.

Waste of time, money, and your life. You might very well  end up growing a year older waiting for them to call your name. Over an hour behind 3 visits in a row. Thank the lord it's my final visit as I'll never return. An hour and 20 minutes after being late. The doctor told me he was going to put me on a prescription. Before even telling me why. Told me all the results came back negative. So he thought putting me on an anti-inflammatory for the heart sounds like the proper fix. Seem to care more about getting out the door than actually trying to figure out what the problem is.

The location is not perfect and the Flourescent lights were a bit weird for a nice place to eat. But hands down some of the best cooked sea food I have had on a long time. The owners are very nice. Given the portions and the quality of food you can't complain. I will definately be a returning customer.

If you like green chili pork this Is a great place to go. Just know the hatch green chili sauce has some heat. Some days spicier than others.
