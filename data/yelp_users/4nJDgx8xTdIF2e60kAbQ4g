I wanted to order a couple of pizzas for a friends b-day party.  Mobile seemed easy but nope.   Then laptop to place an order online.  Did it work nope.   I guess Domino's in Michigan decided to switch their ordering service and it didn't migrate the info.  What a headache!!!!!!!!! Don't order online it suks!  They should comp the first order it takes foreva! The re-entry of data and all that update stuff seems wasteful and reminiscent of horrible apps gone by. Bye Domino's it was fun.

I went to Jerry's last night for dinner.  We always eat there and usually like the atmosphere.  This time there were protesters there with anti-Nazi signs.  They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again. 4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now.

This June, I was flooded out of a ground floor apartment.  The landlord put me up at the Clarendon Hotel, where I was immediately reminded of Miami, Florida during the 70's.  Rainbow stripped tiles lead your eye across the pool area and around the insides of the pool deck ledge.  The saltwater is soothing and tear-free with even more properties to be desired.  A favorite pool activity is floating in the water.  The buoyancy of my mind and body were enhanced by the saltwater and listening to the underwater music system.  This weightless feeling made the whole experience quite relaxing.   It also describes what a stay at this hotel can be for a guest.  Easy, carefree and weightless.  The standard room has a king bed and ample table space.  Some art on the walls looked quite unique.  One piece on a wood plank that was mounted to slide from one end of the room to the window.  It was more functional than practical, but intriguing nonetheless.  The other side of the room had a black shade covering another window out the opposite side of the building.  Calming music filled the room from the iPod dock and heated glass with a blueberry scent met my senses as I first entered the room.  It was nicely accommodated with locally made products in a basket.  The amenities included unlimited bottled water, ice and snacks along with a spectacular wine cooler.  There is really not much left to do with a toilet seat when it lowers without slamming, the bathroom sink is broad and waste basket narrow.  The shower sports dispensers for shampoo, conditioner and soap to reduce the waste of little bottles.   When you get the remote A/C unit set to just the right temp it feels like you are set to kick back and enjoy a great stay.  Check out was quick without surprise add-ons.  I would like to repeat this again soon just without the flood as the impetus to my taking the room for the night.  Breakfast at Gallo Blanco, across from the hotel lobby, was so tasty that I went out to Otro Café that weekend for brunch and can enthusiastically recommend both places as well, but that is for another review.

What a find!  The first time I walked into the place I saw handmade clothes, jewelry, pottery, shoulder bags & coffee.  The back section had health and beauty creations from soaps to hair care products all locally made.  The coffee is great and I like the hummus and flax seed crackers since I'm gluten intolerant.  Usually I go into the library and browse the Internet and read some of the zines people have written like, "Jail Stories."  This place is such a good spot that I bring everyone from out of town to it.  One person described Conspire as an artist collective akin to those found in Seattle or Portland.  Da bomb for shiz.

First time, live down the street and decided to stop in for a beer.  The comdedian on Monday nights was talking about carrying weapons and how funny that is.  The bartender was dressed in a tie, but don't let it fool you, he's not polite.  At one point, he was threatening me with violence to leave the establishment.  No reason.  But beware, this place feels creepy and sketchy.  The beer was okay, but a bit over priced and less than I would expect from a gambling establishment.  My take on the place, there is no way I would cross their threshold again.

Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.   Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch that's not too pricey and homemade.   The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce. The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  It's wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside.

The first thing, the place smells really good.  Food was awesome, salads and tacos, chicken and vegetarian, there's a little something for everyone.  Homemade chips and an excellent salsa keep you going til the main entrees are served.  We ordered a Blood Orange margarita and regular house blend both were`a bit weak for our taste.  The dessert of a fried ice cream went well and the server was pleasant.

Bicycle-friendly and vegan, Green is one of my favorite places.  I ordered a Mickey sandwich with a side of faux Buffalo wings.  While that was being prepped, I ducked out to Nami next door and got a peanut butter and chocolate blizzard, non-diary treat.  It was obvious that I should eat the Nami first, because its the best.  That Nami was so delicious it made the whole meal a real treat.  Thanks to the cooks at Green and the folks at Nami I had a vegan feast fit for a peasant.   Cole slaw, french fries and tasty vegan meats layered between toasted bread of the Mickey sandwich, it was simply good.

Sign on door says, "Closed for one month."  Really enjoyed Safeway rotisserie chicken and baked potato salad.  Glad, "open" is part of Safeway's business model.

Breakfast restaurants are a natural place to start the day.  This one has vibrant colors and a modern decor.  We decided to sit on the patio since the music was loud and my friend couldn't hear with that much background sound.  The full bar provided a ginger beer and vodka drink that was delicious.  Heaters for chilly days are available but today it was not needed given the warm day. Our brunch was sweet potato pancakes with caramel sauce and walnuts and an eggs benedict over palenta with hash browns.  They arrived a bit late as did the coffee, but the wait and a good stiff drink made the extra time fly by. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are excellent, this food is exceptional. Snooze has plenty of young people and a very kind and efficient staff that keeps pace with a constant steady business in the middle of the day. The location is perfect with a high-end grocery store and a bulk store around the back of the mall.  After the meal you can walk around the renovated mall and shop to your heart's content.

Open during the week day, this unique café anchors a strip of shops on the corner of 40th St. and Thomas.  There are very tempting desserts and sweet breads.   One meal we ordered was chicken and waffles.  This combo came with a sweet and a spicy sauces and was a big winner for taste.  My order was a portabello mushroom burger.  With a delicious bun that reminded me of Schlotski's bread, the sandwich was served with fries and plenty of veggies on the burger. The Green Tea was notably good.   With free refills, the thirst-quenching, drink encouraged us to enjoy a healthy hydration.   For dessert we tried a chocolate cookie, mochaccino caramel cupcake, and pecan pie.  They were fresh and delicious and a great take-home item.  These are part of a selection that includes scones, pies, donuts and bars.   Anthony was our server and kept us satisfied with ideal suggestions for food and beverage.  To my delight, the owner/chef came out from the kitchen and spent time visiting with customers.  This place is a great lunch time treat that will cater to vegans and the glutton-free crowd while pleasing their omnivorous friends.
