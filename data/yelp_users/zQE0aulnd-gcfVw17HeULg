VALUE. You get an entree, Bread, Salad, desert and coffee or Tea  for about $10. That's a steal.   Some of the entrees are pretty average but the mizithra cheese spaghetti is OUTSTANDING, and i always leave here full.    I'd give them 3 stars for most of their food, but I have to bump them a star because the value you get is rare and the mizithra is worth the trip alone.

Good good ol' Armadillo Grill. It's been years since I used to frequent this place during my car biz days, back then I used to come here for their "Armadillo Gold" wings and CHEAP happy hour drink specials. This review will focus on my most recent experience here.   I came here because I was looking for a reasonably priced healthy meal at 1 am, a virtually impossible combination to find at this time. And I got exactly that, a hearty blackened chicken salad with fresh greens topped with a generous amount of moist and savory chicken. It was very good, and for about $10 it's the only place I can think of that I can get a quality salad this late at night let alone for that price.  In addition to the food which is surprisingly good for a bar, they have very attentive and friendly service. I always leave 'dillo feeling well fed and like I got my money's worth. This establishment has made it's self synonymous with quality food and value in my book and earns a 4.5 from me.

My Denim alterations were satisfactory, it was done in one day, the place is conveniently located in my area, I'm satisfied. I'll  be back, if my experience is the same they will get that 5th star for consistency

As soon as I walked into this chipotle I was greeted by a line that was almost out of the door. The staff was working very hard to take orders and cook the food and the line went much faster than I thought it would, no complaints there.   The issue tonight was a matter of health. Simply put, the steak in my burrito bowl was  grossly undercooked. So undercooked that the meat was actually cold. I get it, it's busy so the food is being rushed but there is no excuse for this egregious error.   Usually this type of transgression would get an automatic one star as my health was potentially compromised but I bumped them a star because the staff quickly made me another bowl and because they did such a good job handling the large crowd.  This better be an isolated occurrence because next time I'll have to report them to the state

I'm hesitant to give 5 stars. I do it only when a place offers and experience I cannot get elsewhere.  POSTINO does that , their Bruschetta, ambiance, service and VALUE are a combination that is unmatched in Phoenix.   Did I mention value? Mon & Tues you can order 4 diff types of bruschetta and an entire bottle of wine and pay $20, TOTAL. I challenge you to find a better deal.       Back to service , JAKE our server was great tonight, he has a very friendly demeanor and  made excellent recommendations. I've Been here about 10 times before, he was part of the reason I was compelled to write this review tonight.

In my quest to find healthy and quick meal options I have come across One Stop Nutrition, and it turned out to be everything I'm looking for and more.   One Stop is similar to GNC or Vitamin Shoppe in the fact that they cary a large variety of workout supplements, vitamins and other health products. What sets One Stop apart from the competition is the made to order nutritional shakes they offer.   You start by picking the type of shake, "meal replacement" "post work out " "mass gainer" or "the slimmer" are among the options. you then choose a base "non fat yogurt" "soy milk" "juice" or almond milk. and finally you pick a flavor. Today I got  The meal replacement with non fat yogurt and pina colada flavor, and i must say It got the job done!  It was very tasty, i enjoyed every sip. The shake was Filling, enjoyable and affordable at only $5, Can't beat it.   In addition shakes & supplements they have nutritional offerings such as high protein pancake mix, energy drinks, vegan protein cookies, power peanut butter and even a variety of healthy nut and trail mix combinations. The place really lives up to the name "One Stop" because if your trying to make health conscious choices it is the only stop you need to make. One stop earns 5 stars from me because in my extensive search for fast and healthy meal solutions I haven't found anything like it. Anytime a business can satisfy an unfulfilled need and do it fast and at reasonable cost it will get 5 stars from me. One Stop hits all those marks and they just earned a repeat customer.

They had exactly what I needed to complete  my outfit, a perfectly fitting 1mx shirt in the perfect fall/winter color. In addition to this I only payed $22 for a shirt I expected to pay $50 for.   Service was mediocre, I wasn't acknowledged or asked if I needed help at any point in my visit and the line for the register was longer than I prefer to wait but them having exactly what I needed at an amazing price is worth 4 stars alone. Better service would have got them the 5th star.   Express is always a go to spot for the fit of their clothing and the good sales they sometimes have. I think the 1mx shirt is the best shirt out there

Horrible. Fish is not seasoned, has zero flavor. the "shrimp" is a joke its like 85% breading. and the fries are basic frozen from your grocers freezer.  only an Arizonan who hasn't  been exposed to much outside of the desert would tell you they like this place. your better off at long john silver at least the seafood is recognizable.   i will say that the dipping sauce for the fish is great, but as far as the actual food goes this might be the worst resturant I've ever eaten at.

This place is amazing.   Mac n cheese, thirsty crow, good music, eclectic crowd, right off the lite rail what else could you want!   The staff here is so personable, they remember your name, what you like to drink & they greet you like a family member they haven't seen in years  I give it 5 stars because the food, atmosphere, service and cocktails are top notch! I can't think of anything to complain about. Lux has something special in its DNA That I have not experienced anywhere else I've ever been.

Maybe I got the wrong thing.Because it was just about the most flavorless food I've ever eaten. I got the sweet sausage sandwich with everything on it. All I tasted was  soggy fries with no salt on them and bread.    This is what people from Pittsburgh rave about? A local told me "it's only good when your drunk, well I was and it was still bad. I'm actually at a loss for words, I don't even have anything else to say about what I ate. It sucked, the end.

This place has Swag, I hate using Clich√© terms but it fits. AZ88 just has it, that cool factor. Everything from it's hard to find location to its to its decor and the eclectic crowd it attracts says exclusive and classy.   On my most recent visit, I sat at the bar and ordered a Moscow mule, it was the best Moscow mule I have ever been served at a bar. It was was the PERFECT blend of ginger beer, vodka and lime. Strong and refreshing, as any mule should be but most places can't get it right. Extra points for perfecting my fav cocktail.   The thing that sets az88 apart was the fact that I went there with 4 lady's in their early 20s, I'm 29, it's rare we all can go somewhere and appreciate the establishment. With the age difference we just prefer diff environments, but AZ88 fits the bill for everyone.

This will be long winded-   So after much anticipation and  Many raving rants from the yelp community I finally got to experience Cibo tonight. My expectations were high, and I was not disappointed by any aspect of my experience tonight.  Cibo is a urban bungalow converted into a charming italian eatery. My 1st thought upon entering this place was "wow, what a versatile space". The front patio is rather large and has open space where they have musicians provide music and there's even a fire pit. You can eat inside or out. The inside had a very intimate and warm feeling and perfectly matches the family owned vibe I get from this place.   Let me get to what made my experience great tonight. Our servers name was was Kui. She was very pleasant and extremely helpful. She was full of sincere and convincing recommendations, we pretty much ordered everything she told us to and it was all exactly as she explained it would be.   The food- Per Kui's recommendation I ordered the Diovola Pizza and added the ricotta cheese and it was delicious. This pie instantaneously put cibo above all the Artisanal style pizza places I've tried in Arizona. The Parlor, Pane bianco, and Le Grande Orange are all inferior to Cibo in my book. As good as the pizza was, it wasn't even the highlight of the night. That distinction belongs to their Nutella and Marscapone stuffed crepe with ice cream. Wow, so good it's sinful. The combination of the fresh crepe with Nutella filling and the Ice cream was magical. It is quite possibly the best desert I have ever had in any restaurant.   Tonight's visit to Cibo was actually a test run. I've been looking for a place to hold a dinner for a large party and when I got word that cibo's private "Carriage House" that can hold 50 or more guests I decided to come in and see if the food is good enough to reserve that space for my event. Needless to say they passed the test. Their hospitality, charm, food and character make Cibo one of the finest restaurants phoenix has to offer and I can't wait to show this place off to the guests of my next event.

Meh  Very light on the cheese not much flavor and their "cheese" does not stretch at all(NYers know what I mean)  If this is "NY pizza" it's bellow average NY pizza.   I've been here two times and both times the bottom of the slice was burnt . Venizias in Tempe does a much better job with the sauce and cheese and overall flavor   The price however is amazing. 1.75 a slice makes it a great value. I may come here if I'm broke in between pay checks.   Only reason to come here is the price because the pizza is just something too eat.

Salt and pepper wings are f'n amazing. Mahi fish tacos for $2 on Tuesday's are one of the best deals in Scottsdale period.   The Mexican food was enjoyable as well but I come here for the wings and the tacos.

Impressive, usually I look for a reason not to give a place that 5th star because i dont want overate anything but I didn't find that reason not too here.  Exceptional experience, I had the empenada as a starter, very tasty(I love empenada's) the entre was the fuego pasta. This was the stand out  to me. An entire pasta dish w/ chicken, chorizo, green peppers, onions etc , layer on top of the softest most delicious tortilla I have ever tasted. You could tear a piece of the tortilla and fill it with pasta and meat. Also had the banana burrito desert and some mojitos. Everything I ate I would recommend

In a word - Dump.   From the second you walk in this place you are greeted by the nauseating oder of cigarette smoke, assuming your able to see through the smoke the next thing you will notice is this casinos horrid decor.  The Fort McDowell instantly makes you feel like your walked right into 1982. From the wood trim everywhere to the harsh bright colors this place is decorated with, everything about it exemplifies ugly and outdated. Just spending an hour in this place made me feel like I needed to re evaluate my life.   The thing that secured the 1 star they earned from me, THEY DONT HAVE WIFI. Wireless service (Att, Verizon) does not work here. Probably because it's in the middle of nowhere and the signals can't penetrate the building. It's 2014, what business doesn't have wifi? If you expect me to be in your establishment for hours, why must I be cut off from the modern world in order to do so?  Anyway, with casinos like Talking Stick among others that offer a modern, sexy experience, I'd never come back to the Fort McDowell.

Called in to place delivery order , person who answered must be new because she had absolutely no clue about the menu or prices, provided incorrect info about the price of toppings..    I ordered a "CHICAGO DEEP" , waited about an hour and and was delivered a thin crust pizza,  driver said keep the pizza, took one bite and the crust was UNDER COOKED..  I called them and they sent me the deep dish I ordered and that too was very undercooked. Not enjoyable at all..   Can't give them even one star because the service and food sucked. Only plus would have been of that free thin crust I got was edible.  Ive ordered here before, don't know what happened to this place.. I'll go to le grande orange next time.

$10 cover = not worth it. Came here with 4 ladies and they were all ready to leave after 30 mins..   We thought we were going to a cool downtown bar to drink but this place is a club? Kinda? Anyway, none of us were feeling the music or the crowd.  I'm giving this place a 2, since it wants to be a club I'll compare to the other local clubs (like revolver) which are average at best, bar smith comes in below these.

4.5 stars. Not the best burger I've ever had but easily the best fast food burger chain on the west coast (shake shack has the nationwide crown). Everybody loves In-N-Out, so I almost didn't bother writing a review because you already know what to expect.  I decided to write about what makes this place valuable to me, PROTEIN STYLE (burger with no bun wrapped in lettuce). Any place I can get a quick no carb meal is likely to get a high grade from me, add the fact that I can get this till 1:30 am and you've made your establishment invaluable. My no bun burger with grilled onions was delicious, so delicious that I didn't even miss the bun.   In addition to their food, which is a rare example of quality in fast food, In-N-Out is CONSISTENT. Employees are always polite, food always tastes exactly the same and the price is always right. Part of me wants to give this location the 5th star and the other part of me want to be judicious with my perfect scores, so they get 4.5, only because I think "the stand" is a little better and deserves the 5 a little more.

Pretty standard dog park here.  Benches, trees, grass and open space for the dogs to run.   I usually come here on sundays and there's always plenty of dogs for remy to frolic with. In all my experiences the other dog owners have been responsible and courteous and there hasn't been an excessive amount of dog poop so I have no complaints.  Mitchell Dog park gives my dog the much needed opportunity to interact with other dogs and I will continue to comeback and take advantage of this free community asset provided by the city of Tempe.

Ok, I regularly shop At Vinnie's Styles in Brooklyn and Goliath Uptown. I understand that this place isn't a cutting edge boutique.   Lets put this in perspective, it's in ARIZONA, and it's in a MALL. Ask yourself, do they bring something to the mall and to the city of scottsdale that would be missing if they left? YES THEY DO. They have some brands that are not widely avail in AZ (bornfly, popular demand) and they are in a convenient location..  I appreciate that a place like this exists they are an added reason to go to fashion SQ as this and Macy's are the only stores I check for. I'm giving them 4 stars, not in comparison to its fairfax Ave or NYC counterparts but because of the value it adds right here in AZ.

Went here 08/1/2013 place was shut down by the county and the notice said "Imminent Hazard".  it appears they had refrigeration issues but still chose to stay open. Think about that. Sushi with out proper refrigeration? (Vomits). Never again, if you come here after knowing this you deserve a stomach virus.  They obviously don't care.

This 5 star rating applies to this Wingstop and every other Wingstop it have been too.   I'm giving them 5 stars because they are simply the best at what they do.  I'll start with their wings. They use a quality grade of chicken wing to start with, wings are a nice size but not artificially large like those humongous hormone wings you see some places. The wings are always fried perfectly crispy, to order, And tossed in the sauce of your choice. I usually go with Parmesan Garlic, lemon pepper or Louisiana rub, all of these flavors are delicious and I have yet to get tired of them.   Aside from wings, their fries are to die for and they have the best ranch dressing I have tasted in my life. Wingstop is getting the 5 star rating from me by default. When I want good wings, fast, there's no alternative. The "competition" like long wongs, wing street and even BWW doesn't come close as far as quality or flavor. Wingstop is invaluable to me as it's really the only place that does wings right in my area and they have proven to be consistent and FAST.

Drinks are strong, pizzas are tasty. They serve Moscow mules, great atmosphere and it's RIGHT offend light rail.   I can't think of many other places in the Phoenix area with all these qualities and the get extra points due to the fact that I can get super drunk and stumble right to the light rail to get home. NO DUI  If I had to find a downside  in my 3 visits I would say that a couple menu items can be on the salty side (prechuito sandwich, sausage/pep pizza) but I still give this place a strong 4/5

2.5  but definitely not good enough to bump to 3 stars.  Just to get to the restaurant you must navigate through the dreary casino that is Fort McDowell (see my review on Fort McDowell).  And this restaurant is CLEARLY an extension of said casino.   Let's get to the point, the only reason your even considering coming here,*Drumroll*... ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS. Yes, its true, for $9.99 you can sit for hours and eat crab legs until you can't can move. IMO, that is the only reason to come to this restaurant or even the casino for that matter. The crab legs were plentiful and were pretty good, these are snow and not king crab legs so they require a bit of work for the amount of meat you get. I ate my weight in crab and did not dare to touch anything else offered in the buffet. The rest of the food (enchiladas, green beans, macaroni, etc.) looked deplorable. I get, Crab is expensive, and if they must give you something else to eat in addition to the crab its going to be the cheapest side dishes they can call "food". No thank you.    The real question: Is all you can eat crab legs worth the visit? *sigh*, Kinda, not really. I don't regret making my 1st visit, but at the moment I'm not compelled to return. After I was stuffed to the gills with crab, and had to make the journey back to civilization, reality set in. The reality of having to drive 30 miles, 10 miles of that through surface streets, burn 1/8th  of a tank in gas, and walk thru a casino that is more like a smoky time portal to the Reagan era.. probably not worth it. I could save myself $15 in 91 octane premium petro and just eat at the local red lobster for far better food and a better experience.

Since the current ownership has been here my apt has been entered illegally on multiple occasions. Their maint staff appears to be quite incompetent as they operate outside of the context of the law and have violated my rights as a tenant in order to "fix" things that they could not manage to fix in what has now been more than 60 days and counting.  Yeah, Alanza is a cool place to live because of its prime location, but when my privacy  and rights are being violated I can't rate higher than one star.  I will state that rashonda had been particularly outgoing in her efforts to take control of the chaos that has been my recent experiences here. But I am infuriated with being a prisoner to illegal entry of my apt and I will not let these occurrences go unpunished with out a satisfactory resolution or legal action

MEH!  The food here is very bland. I had the BLT with shrimp. Tasted like bread and unseasoned shrimp. My friend had the Mac n cheese..  There's a lot of places in the area serving very tasty Mac N cheese but the Mac here is BLAND. It's on par with craft easy mac, boiled noodles with what I assume is an artificial "cheese sauce". I'm not even sure it contains cheese.    I think my problem is that this place is a bar and I came here to eat but yeah the food Must be an after thought here, I would not come back.  @ the owners, go Taste the Mac n cheese at lux and then STEP YOUR GAME UP, you have an amazing location and your place is very aesthetically pleasing but there is no excuse for your food being so unflavored and uninspired.

Service is SLOW, I waited 27 mins just to place my order.   My wings were pretty good but they are over over priced to say the least, for what 5 SMALL wings cost here I could pay a few more dollars and get a dozen somewhere else.   Food     = 3 stars  Service = 2 stars  Value    = 2 stars

I love this place. Simply put, it's a brewery with great food. The beer menu changes often but the food is consistent.The great thing about OHSO is that it's multi purpose. Sometimes i come to eat dinner, sometimes I come to drink a lot of beer and other times I'll come for the amazing Mimosa brunch.  All of the beers I have tasted have been delicious and the variety of creative brews does not exist elsewhere in the area. As far as the food goes I've had their BBQ burger and their churasco steak and eggs brunch dish. Both of which I would rate 5 stars and the brunch special (an entree with a very large mimosa for $10) is one of the best deals in all of Phoenix.  In addition to great food and great beer, this place is dog friendly, you can bring your dog on the patio, they have water dishes and they even make free doggie biscuits that my dog absolutely loves. That's an extra touch that secures the 5th star for this truly unique establishment. OHSO has become my go to neighborhood bar/brewery and the 1st place I think of when I want to grab a beer.

Royal Jasmine is a nice, clean, aesthetically pleasing restaurant located in Goodyear. It is exactly what I don't expect to find in the burbs, in the land of chain restaurants and mediocre eats royal jasmine is a welcoming Thai spot with an authentic feel.   Overall the the food was good, I had the BBQ chicken and the chicken wing app. BBQ chicken Entr√©e was quite tasty, it had a delicious sauce that gave it a lot of flavor and went well with white rice. The wings however were ok, they were just fried chicken, I don't think they had any seasoning on them and they were served with a side sweet chili sauce. The prices were excellent, most of the entr√©es were under $9. My mother and I had 2 Entr√©es and appetizer and drinks and it came out to about $24  This place earned 4 stars from me because the service was good,t I enjoyed my meal for the most part and the its a very pleasant place to be. Upon entering this place you can tell that its ownership takes great pride in their business and there aren't many places of its caliber in the area.

WOW.  This place is exactly what I've been looking for. It's so simple, SALADS SOUPS & SANDWICHES. But what makes this place special is the options.  I don't eat meat (land animals) so I was excited to see a crab meat sandwich and multiple types of lobster soup and other non meat options.   This place earns it's stars from me because it's in a convenient location and it offers no meat non fried options and a reasonable price! This combination is extremely hard to find. 7.99 and I've got a complete meal, that's amazing value to me. The other thing I appreciate about this place is it's well thought out, they even have a charging station with USB inputs so you can charge your phone WHY DONT ALL PLACES HAVE THIS!?!?

I really like this place - SOLID 4 stars.  Angels Trumpet Ale house is a gastropub conveniently located near Downtown Phoenix just a blocks walk away from the Lite Rail.   My experience here tonight was very short, unfortunately I didn't realize they close early at 12 am. In the 30 mins I was here I was able to enjoy a delicious beer, take in the view of Downtown Phoenix from their patio and even received advice from their friendly staff on where to grab a late night meal in the neighborhood.   This place easily earns it's 4 stars from me for its eclectic mature crowd, location, extensive beer selection and good service. I'll be back, the star rating could go up if the food is up to par with everything else.

Heres a geography lesson for the management at Gypsy Bar. Sam Adams is brewed in Massachusets, Kilt Lifter is brewed in Arizona, this means that these beers are in fact DOMESTIC.(refer to dictionary for definition of domestic)   So if you advertise a happy hour price for domestic drafts I have a problem with you charging me the price for an import draft. ESPECIALLY when you disclose that your ringing up my domestically brewed draft as an "import" after ive already ordered four of them. Yes, this happened. I chose not to make issue of it because it was only a $1 difference but i was turned off by this. If your running a business you need to be clear about what your charging people.   Gypsie bar has an arcade, a very small arcade. I did not find any games i was compelled to play. As far as the mixed drinks go, they are basic and the pricing is not competitive with other places in the area that actually offer craft drinks at the same price. with all the options downtown i dont really see a reason to re visit this place. It seems like a corporate idea to expand lucky strickes revenue rather than an attempt to add a quality offereing to the area.

I love the concept of this place, food drink and free games. There's value there because you can spend A lot playing games at places like Dave n Busters.  Let's get to the food, I had the trout. It was topped with green beans almonds and onions, what a nice combination of flavors. The fish was cooked just right, it was moist and I enjoyed every bite.   Another memorable thing from my dinner here is they have these mystery brown paper bag beers for $1.50. You never know what beer you will get (icehouse was one of them) but this is a great deal! And it's kinda cool drinking a beer out of a paper bag in a restaurant.

The Sushi last night was excellent. I got the roll with soft shell crab and eel sauce (can't look up the name because they have no online menu) Sushi was fresh, rice was perfect, the roll was nice and stuffed they don't give you those tiny rolls some other places do.    The service was quick and attentive, the location is SUPER convenient and the ambiance is very pleasing.   MY COMPLAINT .  The website has no Menu, nor does it acknowledge that this location exists. Fix that Immediately. It's 2013 "menu coming soon" does not cut it and I almost deducted a star because if this

Second time here this week. Again, sushi was amazingly fresh, discovered a gem on the menu, curry shrimp and rice plate, very nice portion and it is so delicious and was about $13.  This place really surprises me with the prices, for the freshness of the seafood and the portion that they give you I would expect to pay 20% more. Today I came with a party of 10 and EVERYONE was satisfied with their experience.

Had the Kale Caesar  with shrimp, greens were so fresh sand shrimp was seasoned just right. It was delicious.   I'm giving this place 5 stars because how many other places can a grab something to eat in 5 mins for $10 that is not fried, full of sugar or carbs or doesn't contain meat that I don't eat ? (pescitarian).  In addition to eating a healthy, filling and delicious meal I had a blast playing chess on their life sized chess set for 2 hours. This place is awesome and I will become the duke!

Went from a shatterd iPhone 5 to Like new in about 20 mins this morning. That in itself was invaluable to me as i had limited time to get to work.   The place opens at 10 AM but the owner (my assumption) was in early and had my phone fixed 30 mins before the store was even supposed to be open. They did an excellent job, the replacement screen looks and operates like just like the original one did when I bought the phone.   My only complaint would be that I called the store yesterday and I was told that I could come in today and that I would be charged $80 for refurbished glass , I informed the employee that I would be there at 10am SHARP today and I expected the deal that he quoted me.   Upon arriving today I was told that they don't have refurbed glass and that I could wait for them to order it or pay $110 for brand new glass. This is obviously very diff than what I expected and after a little back and fourth with this owner he decided to honor what I was originally told. So in the end I received brand new glass for the refurb price. The owner ultimately made it right, but this transgression cost them a star from me. I EXPECT TO GET WHAT I WAS TOLD and I don't expect to have to discus it, that level of consistency should be automatic.   Overall I had a good experience, the service was friendly and professional, I would return if I needed another repair done but I advise everyone to make sure they get EXACTLY what was quoted to them.

Christan is A very talented barber. His barbering skills and customer service is the reason I stopped going to my old barber shop.   He has VERY flexible hours, I usually get my haircuts at 8pm on weeknights after work.  His availability during these hours are invaluable to me.

Clever Koi Is exactly what was needed on central. A unique & innovative Restaurant.  Aesthetically, it's very nice , great lighting decor, ambiance & music.  Today was the "soft opening" and the the place was packed which was pretty impressive because everyone knew about it from word of mouth.   The Food: I tried the Pork Noodles and they were delicious and for $11 the price wasn't bad.  I had the "enabler" cocktail, it was Ok, kinda pungent, I'll def try something else next time.. I'll be back soon to try other things and update my review.

The Angry Crab Shack , Where to start?  So like many of you, I have been desperately waiting for a Boiling Crab knock off to arrive in AZ. As you can see By my reviews of  "The Boil" in NYC, "The shrimp lover" in Hollywood and of corse Boiling Crab that I love these type of places. So today when I saw this place on yelp I couldn't wait to get in there and try it out..  The Food: Cajun Fries were ON THE MONEY.  Perfect level of Cajun spice. The shrimp with Trifecta Sauce (whole shebang @ BC ) was good, not Great but good. Of corse the shrimp here is frozen (this is the desert) so it's evident in the texture that this place isn't getting it straight off the boat, HOWEVER, there was no issue with the shrimp looking old or tasting bad so I won't complain(as some of you have SMH).The sauce, although not as good as the other places I mentioned was still tasty(it's missing MINCED GARLIC) My one complaint about the food was the cornbread, it sucked, very small and didn't taste like it was made today, (please replace that with another bread option)  Service: WOW, the service tonight was excellent, our server was very enthusiastic and confident in his recommendations, he was attentive and friendly. Our food came out FAST, seemed like 5 mins and our table was visited by diff managers/owners who seemed to be very concerned with how our experience was going.   Overall, it was a good experience, I would suggest that they replace those napkin holders with paper towel rolls ASAP, and that they ditch the table cloths for the wax paper all the other spots use,& ADD MINCED GARLIC TO THE SAUCE! I really love the graffiti wall for the guests to tag on. I appreciate them bringing this to AZ, and I think with a few Tweaks they can perfect the concept. But since they Have been open less than 2 weeks, and because the service was exceptional they will get 4 stars and I will be back to update my review.

WOW, this is the best Caribbean/Latin restaurant of any kind I have experienced in AZ. Honestly Its better than the Dominican spots in NYC.  I had the Pollo Guisado. Chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the sauce added great flavor to the rice that was already perfect on its own. The platanos maduros were some of the best I have ever had.  The food here is made with pride and attention to detail, everything I tasted was AUTHENTIC.   Don't forget to try the Morir so√±ando, a delicious milky citrusy drink that by itself is enough reason to return to Sazon Bachata.
