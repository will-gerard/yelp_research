This place is such a little hole in the wall dive but the people there are very nice and the food is authentic and amazing. Might I add this is 100 times better than Filibertos and should be given a chance!

So where do I start.. First let me state that the food is great. Service is complacent, but disrespectful, disheveled and all around rude. CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY. There, I did the owners job and posted cash only, since you know, there is no notice on the entrance, or at the register. Now, if your used to the Asian culture, it may not be quite as much of a shock to the system, but be prepared to be treated like nothing more than a number, with cash, cuz you know, cash only.  But dang their food, and beverages are good!

This has been my go-to Thai spot in the valley for going on 6 years now. I can't say enough good things about the place. Clean, orderly, subtle ambiance. Hard working waitresses. The place is great and the food is portioned well. You need to try there crab puffs. These aren't pre-made frozen nonsense. This place will continue to be a regular spot for me for years to come. (Oh and try there lyche Sake!)

Let me first state that the food is rather authentic and delicious. But the staff has ruined the experience for the third time now. The woman behind the counter is really rude. No customer service skills at all. If they get the order wrong wouldn't you expect them to correct it or at the very least apologize? Nope, not here.... What would otherwise be a weekly visit has become a 86'd location for me because of poor service. I can and do cook, I go out to eat because it's faster and convenient, but when you are disrespectful to my girlfriend, and then start complaining in Spanish to you co workers you lose all respect for me. By the way, I may be a 6ft tall red head, but hablo espa√±ol muy bien. And my girlfriend is a native speaker. Ignorance will not be tolerated.

Walk in at 4:40 PM with two customers whom have already had their order taken, my girlfriend placed her order for a Philly cheese steak, I ordered Cajun fries and a pizza sandwich. 18 minutes later we my girlfriends sandwich was delivered with the fries and the worker was confused when I asked about my sandwich. So I ask for it and he states it will be right out. 3 more groups of customer come in, order and sit down. 30 minutes now and I see a worker deliver my sandwich to a different guest for which it is promptly returned. 7 minutes later it's given to me, the same sandwich. (Health code violation) now I return it and at the 50 minute mark I got my sandwich burned. Stay away from eating in? Yeah for sure. I should have checked the reviews of this hovel first before ordering food here. Don't waste your time.

Holy cow! I wasn't expecting good food, good price and a spotless place! Usually one is lacking but this place is on point! Try the Mac n cheese burger and an Oreo shake. There fries are great, likely due to the crystal clear grease. I will be back!

Awesome food and pricing. Service is par and ambiance needs work, but the food makes up for any misgivings!
