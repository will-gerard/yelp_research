Incredible food and outstanding service!  Everyone that worked there was just as nice as could be.  I got the pecan crusted sirloin and my husband got the rib eye. They were both delicious and came out at perfect timing.  The prices are decent and definitely well worth it for the great experience.

Amazing food and great service!! The food was fresh and very tasty. We will definitely be back to this fantastic restaurant. Such a hidden gem! Support the locally owned restaurants :)

Heard about this place so we had to try it. Very glad we did! Loved the options available to chose from.  Pizza cooked quickly and wasn't greasy.

The food and service are both really good!  I've been here a few times now and everything has been consistent.   It was hard to pick what to order off the menu because everything sounded really good! I got the grilled cheese burger and it was delicious!  Highly recommended!!

We went here on a week night in Feb 2016 for my mom's birthday.  Unfortunately, the experience was horrible.  There was a big party in the restaurant at the same time as us; however none of the staff mentioned that our order would be delayed because of the large party.  We were there for over 2 hours and waited a good 1.5 hours before our food was served...uncooked mind you.    We were considering coming here again  when there wasn't a large party to give it another shot, but the food was not worth coming back for. The steak was unseasoned and had awful texture. It is understood that you cook the meat yourself on the stone at your table; which is why we were perplexed when it took so long to get out to us.   The manager took almost no responsibility for the situation.  I like to see local owned restaurants flourish and unfortunately this one will not earn our business again.

We love the pretzel bites! The pizza and salads are great too.  The food is consistently good!  Unfortunately the sun was shining pretty bad on our table from the Western Windows and made it pretty unpleasant.  When we addressed it to the manager he didn't seem to really care and said there was nothing he could do.  Otherwise it would have been a nice night out.
