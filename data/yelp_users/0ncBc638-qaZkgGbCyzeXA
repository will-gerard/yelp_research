The worst experience I have ever had at a "dr.'s office" in my life. Tamara was the worst "doctor" I have ever seen. When I was asking serious questions she made me feel like an idiot and stupid like I should know everything. When I asked her about her experience in the field she answered in the most disrespectful manner while handing me a list of websites to check out instead of her "Experienced" self answering them for herself?...... Never again will I visit this place or Tamara for that matter again.
