My new obsession! I am a massage therapist and heard about Ocotillo Pilates from a client of mine who was in the best shape of her life thanks to pilates.  I love to workout and change up my routine but this truly kicked my butt.  I am not sure I will ever go back to yoga again.   I had a junior instructor named Sarah.  She was so knowledgeable and truly amazing.  I loved that she was so aware of my spine and posture.  I could tell that she truly loved what she was doing and that impacted my experience greatly.  I have never had such a wonderful experiece working out and can't wait to book my next appointment.  I quickly bought a package deal and truly feel this is my new way of life.  Not only was the equipment top of the line, the space was so open and clean.  It was so nice to have one on one training in an environment that was not intimidating.  I highly recommend Ocotillo Pilates and will be buying a package for my husband to train with Sarah as well.

My husband and I finally made it to High Tide last night. After just returning from two weeks along the southern coastline we were missing the delicious seafood already.  I'm glad I called and made a reservation as we arrived at 5:45 and it was already very busy.   We were seated promptly at a nice table.  Our waiter was awesome! His name was Justice and he was so knowledgeable and patient. Offering many suggestions as it was our first time. The have some great happy hour items that we were able to order at our table.  We started with clams and calamari as well as wine and beer.  All were very good. My husband ordered the The King steampot and loved it. I had the scallops and they were amazing. Justice was so mindful of getting us to our movie on time but at the same time welcoming us to stay as long as we wanted.  We will definitely be back!

I love this place! Not only is it a great local spot, the owner is so nice and the food is fabulous! Their grilled sandwiches are so good.  I had their chop salad today and was so impressed. The friend I was with didn't get basil on her sandwich, when she mentioned it they quickly fixed it.  The owner then came over and dropped off a delicious pastry thing that he makes in house every morning.  Will definitely be going on a regular basis.

My husband and I took our three kids here last weekend. Everyone was so nice and friendly. Others on the wait staff even checked on us. The food was very good. We ordered the hush puppies as an appetizer and loved them. My son got a catfish po boy and it was amazing!   My only complaint was our waitress (who was super nice) however, I ordered a cup of red beans and rice for dinner and received the bowl. No big deal! I'll pay the extra $5-6 and let it slide.  My nine year old ordered herself a catfish and fries off the kids menu. It was huge and we commented on it and our waitress laughed. When the bill came we were charged for the dinner catfish vs kids. We asked our waitress and she said our nine year old daughter didn't specify kids.  I feel like it's obvious that my child would order off the kids menu since she was sitting their coloring on their kids menu that the server brought. We will definitely give it another try but be more specific apparently.

My husband and I went to SoCal Fish last night.  We had a great experience from the friendly employees to the delicious food.  The decor is super fun and cool.  Everything looked clean and well maintained.  Our waitress Jackie was very helpful in helping us choose a beer and tacos.  We started with the best calamari fries we've ever had, tortilla soup and ceviche tacos.  The ceviche was so amazing! For dinner, we had lobster tacos, the special of the month, and the seared ahi tuna salad with the sesame dressing.  Both were exceptional!  We had such a great experience! The place was packed and everyone was hustling.  The patio had a bunch of heaters but I was chilly sitting inside as both the doors were open.  Just bring a sweater.  All in all, we can't wait to go back and bring our three kids or visitors when they are in town.  Wish this place was closer to our house, like in Chandler:)

They may clean your car okay but over an hour wait for the most basic wash! Ridiculous. Every time I go to Jacksons, I remember why I should never return!

So excited this place opened up!  What a great way to spend a couple of hours with friends.  I love the very descriptive wine menu. They also have a really great happy hour.  The vibe is so laid back and cozy yet chic. The only thing my friend and I tried were the bruschetta and a bottle of wine.  The flavor was so good but we didn't like the bread.  We both agreed that Postinos is the gold standard of Bruschetta so when it was served on very hard toast points we were bummed. The flavor was there but the bread was not. I will definitely try it and head there for dinner soon.
