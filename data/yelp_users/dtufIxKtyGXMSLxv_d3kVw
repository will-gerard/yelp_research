Atmosphere was hip and cool. Food was decent... slightly above average. Service sucked. We were told that our reservation would be late by 15-minutes, our server seemed in a massive rush at all times (he barely stood at teh table when he asked us any questions, just rushed off while we were talking), food took forever to get out, and had to ask for several things he forgot several times. Skip this place... there are better "hip pizza restaurants" in town that will also give you good service.

I interviewed several companies before hiring B&W Limo. There was a slight issue that was handled with the utmost professionalism. I was truly impressed. I will work with this company again, as they value customer service. I highly recommend this company.
