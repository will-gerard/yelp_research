The pizza has really never been any good but at one time it was a pizza and wings combo at a decent price. At this point, it's just overpriced greasy food. Bummer.

I love the BBQ sauce! I just ate a plate of sausage links, fries and bubba beans.  The fries are standard fries but having the BBQ sauce and Bubba Beans available for dipping put them over the top.  I love the Bubba Beans. They are almost like a chili but have a different flavor than your standard chili.  The sausage had great flavor and just the right making of heat.  Well done Town Talk :)

Great place for a beer and bite. Came in with some friends, had a couple of beers with fries and a pretzel. The pretzel was good but the true find was the Thai Ketchup dipping sauce. Definitely worth trying out.

I was at shopping center at the 101 and Scottsdale Road with my five month old daughter. She needed a change of her diaper and was hungry and I needed to use the facilities and somehow warm her bottle.   We stopped in and asked to sit at a booth. The host was very helpful and allowed me to place my daughters carrier in the booth a leave the stroller in front of the table.  The server was also accommodating and brought me a warm water to heat the milk in my daughter's bottle. I ordered 6 hot buffalo wings -grilled and then took my daughter to the bathroom to change her and relieve my bladder. There was a changing station in the men's room and it was also very clean.  When I returned the bottle was ready and my daughter began to feed. The wings shortly came out and after finishing her bottle, my daughter took a nap.   The wings were awesome. Don't get me wrong, I think most sports bars have a similar tasting order of wings with a variation of Frank's Red Hot sauce. These were different.   First, I love grilled wings. After they are cooked, char them in the grill and they will give you a great grilled flavor. Second, the sauce had a little more zip, was possibly mustard based(?)but just enough heat to be tasty. I would love to find out more about this sauce. Third, the server was great; she helped get me set up and was super nice. I had a great lunch and a great experience.

My wife and I had Hopdoddy on early evening of March 5, 2016. I had the Magic Shroom Burger, she had the Goodnight/Good Cause and we split the Green Chile Queso. We also had a beer and a soft drink from their root soda fountain. I believe our total was around $26.   There was a long line that went out the door. It took a little bit of time to get to the counter but the staff was helpful and brought out samples of the shakes and fries while we waited. Once we got through the line and placed our order we were seated and our food came out fairly quickly.   The Green Chile Queso came out before our burgers and was very good as an appetizer and we continued to munch on it after our burgers came out. Both of these burgers were delicious. I really enjoyed my hamburger, it was cooked all the way through but was still juicy and the toppings really added to the flavors. I was a little skeptical at the thought of having pesto and goat cheese on a burger but it was a good combination and I am hooked. My wife's burger was equally as good.   Overall the meal was very good. I think the burgers are better than Zinburger and they cost a little less. I see a few comments about the order process and while it is different I did not feel there was any reduction in the service. I really like this place and we will definitely be back.

This was my first experience with Shake Shack. Today, I ordered the following:  'Shroom Burger French Fries w/ Cheese Small Coke Total cost: $14  I arrived at 2:15pm, there was a small line and the eating area was about 70% full. I quickly ordered and waited about 10 minutes for my food to be prepared. The fries and cheese sauce were okay but luke warm. I would prefer both to be hot, especially the cheese sauce. The 'shroom burger was a little messy but tasted good. I think it is a little on the smaller side but did find it tasty.   Ultimately, my meal cost about $14, that is a little high for fast food. I will probably be back at some point because I live close to this location and I want to try other items on their menu. That said, my first impression is that The Habit and The Stand provide better food at a better price.
