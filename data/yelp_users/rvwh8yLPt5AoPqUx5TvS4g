Having spent the majority of my adult life eating 1-2 meals in restaurants every day, gives me a sincere appreciation (along with being an investor in a couple of restaurants) for Restauranteurs who are "doing it right".  Brunch today was as good as any brunch on the planet! Excellent food with superb service on one of the most comfortable patios in Phoenix.  You folks are doing a wonderful job...  Thank you for serving us!

Invited by a group of friends, food was less than marginal, cool place, but dirty; low service, although they were not busy - roof leaks when it rains - critters...

Sam is a good guy, providing a good selection in a very small town.  If you want cheap, go to WallMart...

If you have a yearning for authentic Italian food, Pomo is a good choice.  Nice Owner, involved and caring...

I have visited Tryst on a handful of occasions this year; the service staff is very friendly and seem to help each other out, regardless of who took the order. The food is good and waiting time is reasonable.  The Owner is a doll, often on site and very attentive...

The faux quintessential atmosphere is not reminiscent of any quality restaurant I have visited in New York, or any quality restaurant throughout the world; with, perhaps, the noted exception of Russia - if you made a wrong turn.  The quality of the product and temperatures of the protiens were impeccable, spoiled by an over abundance of seasoning; cheesey potatoes were exactly that - uninspiring.  Salads & Deserts were fine.  Server cute/nice,  not particularly well trained.  Not what someone would expect from a 5 Star restaurant or the Mastro family.

This is THE BEST SUSHI in the Valley!!!   We've been going to NORI, at least once a week, for the last 3 years, service is spot on, Brent is always congenial and Lee is one of the most gracious Restauranteurs I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  Both of Nori's restaurants are excellent; they are kept immaculately clean, with the freshest fish in Town.  They deserve a 10!

Candidly, I am a perfectionist and very fussy about my automobiles and do not want to see a scratch on them. Daniel exceeded my expectations, without one doubt.  I highly recommend his work!!!  Thank you Daniel...
