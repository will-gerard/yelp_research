When i first move to an area i have a checklist...grocery store, hole in the wall bar, a couple great restaurants...one of which much be chinese.  i was not let down by Golden Gate. Its a small dark ambiance which i love. The staff is courteous and by now know me when i place my order or walk in with new recruits.   almost as if routine i order the usual sweet and sour pork *light delicious sauce with generous vegetables* crab angels, chow mein and fried rice. i love all of it. then just when you think you're finished, here comes the fried banana for dessert. unbelievable.  every time i recommend this place to my friends, they take a look at the plain exterior and give me the sideways look. the if something goes down im throwing you directly in front of me as a human shield look. then they sink their teeth into their first bite of food.   they they too become golden gate addicts. in a couple words? i HIGHLY recommend.

yelp says the location has closed. apparently that's wrong. because I placed an order tonight based on the fliers they constantly place on my gate. I tried to place an order based on their coupons. apparently they're only offered between certain hours that have no occasion on their coupons. I referred to what was in my gate and they continued to be unattainable  this place does not stick to the advertisements they may apply to their blanket door service. if it were they need to educate their order takers and I will never order from them again party or not. FALSE ADVERTISING! SAVE YOUR MONEY! will send pics upon service.  in retrospect, the girl I ordered with May have been nasty but michael my delivery guy? 5 stars across the boards. tip him hard if that's your dude!!! Gus take note

i was an idiot and dropped my iphone when i plopped out of my truck and cracked the screen, well, i shattered it.  i called. they said come in, quoted me $65 and come back in an hour. I went to go have dinner with my lady and my phone was finished before we even got our food.   The clerk that helped me was courteous, professional, quick and most importantly they were easy on the wallet. Hopefully i won't need their services again, but if i should, i now have their website bookmarked.  i appreciate Quick Fix immensely.

read about him hear on yelp and in a time of crisis he came through magnificently. not only that but he was significantly cheaper in replacing the screen on my iPhone 5c. should I ever need similar services this will be the place I go to first. I was like. child without his fave blanket without my phone. thanks idoctor!

had a little free time and saw this was new to the area, not the valley but the area. lucked out and started with Lulus sweet and spicy Tabasco wings...unbelievable. and the main course was a Cajun Alfredo. delicious. my other diners were in love with their meals as well. it's slightly pricy but you pay for the great cuisine for sure. as a self proclaimed sucker for Cajun, this hit the spot. We will be back. definite.

I'd been seeing the flags for weeks and decided to drop by. at our table was the chicken breast étouffée, red beans and rice with andouille sausage and a roast beef po boy. BEYOND EXPECTATIONs! so delightfully Cajun. I'm an avid New Orleans fan and this rocked my taste buds. of course we had to finish with a basket of beignets!
