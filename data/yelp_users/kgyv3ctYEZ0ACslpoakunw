Fate has great food, but lacks on every other level. I live three blocks away so its upsetting to see a place with so much potential fail.

So a couple of months ago my co-worker and I were on a dangerous mission to find the one great burger in town. After months of search and going into some of the seediest joints in town, we arrived at Welcome Diner, I was a bit skeptical that this place could produce a burger  that my co-worker and I were so desperately seeking, but oh how rad being wrong is, they knocked the shit out of my taste buds with there burger, I got a double with cheese with a fried egg on top (old school son), I literally finished the burger before my co-worker got his (which was like 5 seconds later) , a true delight.   If you go bring cash money thats all they take, also its a small joint so don't go brining like 40 of your office buddies you'll look like a tool.

Rok is probably one of the dopest joints in phoenix. If your trying to get a girl or guy to make out with you, I  highly suggest going to the down stairs bar and parking near the fire place. The service is awesome, every time I go the bartenders remembers my name, (I love that shit) the music is amazing one minute radiohead the next mgmt, really great stuff. The food is a bit pricey but you get a salad with most meals which is a rare thing these days. So overall Rok is a great spot to impress someone you want to make out with.

Ok so I'm going to make this easy.  A. You go through the kitchen to get in the place (so badass) B. Louis makes the best martini you can possibly have. (so badass) C. They gave these chips out like 10 or 20 years ago, that grant the holder          free dessert for life, I happened to know a few peeps who have these          legendary chips. (free dessert poker chips so badass) D. finally the food is good a bit expensive and the service is always        amazing.

I don't know, I feel like throwing 5 stars on something is sorta silly, I mean what is perfection, hmmmm just kidding this place is perfect, if you love food (and ain't that what its all about) then tarbells is the cats meow for you. Its a tad pricey but your taste buds will be thanking you for days to come. Mark really cares about his product and pushes his dishes to new levels. Try the cheese cake with the rosemary caramel sauce, its not of this earth and it will ruin any other dessert exp you'll ever have.  If you take a date there and don't get laid then you officially have no game and need to find cheaper places to go sucker.

So considering I'm a badass yuppie who has a sick 500 square foot apartment in downtown (yeah thats how I roll yo). I have been lucky enough to have lost leaf within stumbling distance, sure they don't sell hard booze or even serve food, and yeah if you ask for ice they get it out of one of the cabinet drawers (I thought that was rad) but this place is pretty relaxed, and a perfect place to take girls who don't get much sun and think the smiths are the greatest band of all time (they so aren't...radiohead son)  One piece of advice is to stay away during first friday it gets really crammed and quite hot, plus these places can't really staff up so service blows son.

Oh Over Easy, you taco bell looking motherfucker. I had such high hopes for this place, I mean the only thing better than breakfast in my book is MAGIC and well there wasn't a whole lot of that coming from my meal. I ordered steak and eggs (a classic) which was like 7 or 8 bucks (in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch), but instincts aside I was still hyped, sadly like most things in my life disappointment:)  The "Steak" basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs, my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross, the coffee drink was good (kinda girly) and the decor was aiight.   So if you find yourself waking up sunday morning smelling like crown royal and cigarettes with someone you barely know and never want to know again take them here.  Oh yeah "Matt's makes this place look like a cracked out denny's or taco bell (ha because it used to be one I know I'm lame) zing."

So I was going to china chili for lunch and on the way I passed this purple square building with bbq graffed all over it, naturally I hit my e-brake and made a u-turn straight out of the movie bullit. The place is a hole but the people who cook there truly love bbq, I got the ribs and a pulled pork sandwich with some purple drink (grape for the white kids)  to wash it down with. The ribs were dope for sure, my pork sandwich was aight but didn't hold a candle to the ribs. I like this place allot there are some service issues, but  when I left the bbq master was outside he yelled "hot did you like the Q" I smiled and threw him some thumbs. (i guess you had to be there)
