Ate here on a Friday night with a friend. When I drove up, I was a little worried as the area is very questionable. There was a sketchy-looking fellow just sitting waiting in a big SUV in the parking lot, so right away I was a bit unnerved. Once inside, I felt a little better. The place was busy which is usually an okay sign.  I ordered the 1 shrimp, 1 fish and chips combo. The shrimp was big and pretty good, the fish was your typical battered fillet without much flavor. I doused it in lemon juice and tartar sauce which helped a little. The fries could have been better. They kind of tasted like Ore-Ida fries from a frozen bag. So really the food part of the experience was just so-so at best, if not a bit bland.   I do have a bone to pick with the presentation of the restaurant though. What's the story with the handwritten signs covering almost every empty space of the wall? 'Do this, don't do that..' it's like they are so afraid of being sued that they came up with every possible less-than-desirable scenario that could possible take place whilst eating out and made a sign for it. To me it just came across as grumpy management. And then there are the sub-par pixelated photos slapped on the back of the booths. It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, "that works."  As a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.  DO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity.

My band The Original Room started utilizing Perfect Timing Studios about a month ago for our weekly rehearsals. We could not be happier with our experience here.  For starters, the rooms are spacious, and include everything you could want for your band. The owner Mike is incredibly helpful in assisting with getting you setup quickly and efficiently to get your practice going, and provides anything you need. Including things you might not think about like water, coffee, and a little break room.  The price cannot be beat either. We use the large room with full PA and monitors that is perfect for our 5 piece band and at only $20/hour for that room, our needs are fully met and we get the most out of our band rehearsals.  If you're looking for a regular or one time rehearsal space, go with these guys! You won't regret it.

As a picky guy, this is the best haircut I have ever gotten. Which is why I became a regular loyal customer. Ask for Chloe, she gets it right every time!
