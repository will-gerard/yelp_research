I wish I could give them no stars. The second time I ate here, I found hair in my food.  After I told management they seem to not care or comp that part of my meal.... After a while we decided to try to eat here again, sadly I shouldn't have done that.  My third visit was cut short because yet again, I found another unwanted hair.  Last time I would ever set foot in that building.  Disgusting.  Beyond disgusting!!

Best place ever to relax with friends, a fun place for a date night.  The owner is pretty awesome. He really helps people understand if they have any questions.  I definitely will be back.
