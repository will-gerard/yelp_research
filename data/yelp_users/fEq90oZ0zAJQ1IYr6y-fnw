What happened? I used to LOVE this Downtown Mesa gem. I went in for lunch today and it was horrible. I was there at 11 AM right when they opened and they were already out of slices. Ok, no problem, they made more. I waited and it didn't take long to get my order. I got two slices and a soda, their lunch special. They double stacked the slices in one slice box and they stuck together so all my toppings from the bottom piece were on the bottom of my top piece. The quality was so subpar for them. The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way. It's Monday, they are closed on Sundays, shouldn't it have been fresh dough? This is the second time in 2 months this has happened on different days. The quality and awesomeness has left. So sad.

Wow! What a great local find! Noticed this little place going in a few months ago. I have been there twice in two days. The food is super fresh and the salsas are great. The carne asada is on point, the chicken is tender. Authentic Mexican street tacos and gorditas. Try it, it won't disappoint

This place is what the vaping/electronic cigarette community has been waiting for. When you first walk in, it's a warm and inviting atmosphere. The warm colors and great music make you feel welcome.  After you look around you notice the HUGE selection of high end, high quality e-liquids. There are at least 50 choices with more being added all the time. And at very reasonable prices. It's nice to have a local shop with so many choices, no more waiting for Vape mail. Plus you can try it before you buy it.   Next you notice all the standard supplies and hardware. But what sets this place apart is the number of high end, hard to find mods. All of the standard equipment and supplies are the lowest prices I have seen for a shop. They are in line with online prices but you don't have to pay shipping or wait for it.   Last but not least, customer service. Family owned and operated. Super friendly and VERY knowledgable. They also hold monthly classes for those interested in more advanced techniques in rebuilding. Amazing store! Worth the drive from any where.

Amazing. Wow. This is vape lounge went above and beyond with making you feel at home. From the warm rich colors, to the poker table, pool table, chess set, it's just warm and inviting. They have a wide range of mods from egos to high end mods. Everything is displayed nicely with the price. Nice selection of e-liquid with more to come. If you are into rebuilding you can buy wire by the foot. Having a good time and don't want to leave but your battery is dying in your mod? They have a charging station. And if you are a newbie they are more than happy to help you get up and going. They have a great range of starter kits.   Customer service is outstanding. Friendly smiles and helpful attitude. They also have a card that after your 10th purchase you get 10% off. Forgot your card? No problem, if you charge it, it remembers you and adds it to your card for you. Great way to track purchases without having to carry another card around.   Really classy, well done and comfortable. The kind of place I would like to hangout and vape all day.
