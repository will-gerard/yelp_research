Nice pool Hall with exceptional service. They were having karaoke which was quite entertaining. Played a few rounds of pool with some old friends and had some reasonably priced drinks. When I make my way back to Phoenix I will definitely stop in here again everyone was very friendly the bar staff was awesome!!

So I absolutely love this place every time I'm in Phoenix we stop there. I was torn between chicken and waffles or shrimp and grits but I broke down and had chicken and waffles with a side of smothered  potatoes.  So good!! Let's not forget the kool-aid  I had the blue mixed with sprite so good. I was stuffed and of course had them fill up my to go cup with kool-aid. I'll be back for my shrimp and grits soon!

I am only giving them a two because the provided food and I was so hungry after a night out. The service was extremely slow and my food was pretty cold as I'm sure it was under the heat lamp for at least 20 minutes. Bad service bad food I will bypass this place if I'm ever in the area

Quick lunch before heading back home to Tucson. Started off with the Starbucks Coffee because I was in need of a pick me up. We settled for Baja tacos they were decent the wait was a little long but all and all not bad, probably wouldn't eat here again unless I am staying at the hotel which isn't likely.

Good times!! So this is definitely a go to for hip hop, very crowded but if you can stand the long bar lines and slightly watered down drinks you will have a good time. My girls and I enjoyed this club we will be back. Just a tip if you can hold it avoid the bathroom. Lol
