I started out here with some Indian guy. I can't remember his name and he was ok. I'm pretty phobic of the dentist and he made me cry. literally.   Went back yesterday for a cleaning and some real work. Dr. Joe transferred to the Chandler office from another location. He ROCKS! He's young, hot, and he *sang* to me when the work was going on forever.  "Just a small town girl....Living in a lonely world...She took the midnight train going anywhere"   He asked if I was doing OK many times and you could tell he was actually bothered a bit when it was hurting.  The missing star is because the office is a bit dated and boring. But Hey! The super fancy, beautiful dentist offices are usually much more expensive.

Took my doggie here for his recurring skin issues. VERY happy with Dr. Chen. He is all about starting small and working his way up to more invasive stuff. He gave me a flowsheet about how they treat dermatitis... So I know what the next step is if what we're doing doesn't work.   They were able to see me the same day. And Dr. Chen never made me feel like he was trying to upsell me on stuff. I did get some skin care products he recommended but I never felt pressured or that I was a bag doggie mom if I didn't buy them. He was like, look... I think this will help and gave solid rationales on why.   I'm very glad to have found this place so close to home. Dr. Chen is now 'My vet".

We've never had a bad time here. The food and the service have always been good. I like this location the best.. it has a more local, hipster vibe. They have art for sale by local artists decorating the walls. Even a few I would buy if they were in my price range.   This is one of our go-to places for a quick, delicious, healthy meal. Sometimes we forget about it and we're debating about where to go.. Then one of us will remember Pita Jungle and the other one is like.. OOOOO, Pita Juuuunngle!"

I've been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints.  AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service.   BJ's is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.

I refuse to be treated like a criminal by default. I WILL NOT give up my personal property becaue they think I might steal something.   Most of the stuff in this place is junk.

TOTAL RIP OFF! Avoid this place at all costs.   I have an 05 diesel VW beetle. Took it in today for a diesel oil change. They tell me the oil pan is stripped and needs to be replaced. To the tun of $715.00 PLUS the cost of the oil change which is about $100.   My good friend is a VW fanatic, so I call him and he does 5 minutes research online and finds there is a part that can fix this issue. The mechanic is adamant that this is absolutely not possible. He said that aluminum oil pans are not repairable under any circumstances. Bold Face LIE! I got a new plug at Napa Auto Parts for FIVE FUCKING DOLLARS made specifically to fix aluminum oil pans.   Not only that... I took a few minutes while I waited for the tow truck to call around. At the DEALERSHIP it would have been $500 for everything *including* the $100 oil change. Everyone knows shit is way more expensive at the dealership, but Big O wanted $315 more than the dealership.   They also told me my back tires were bald and dry rotted. They're not. At. All. And that my left front CV boot was torn and I needed a new front axle. Had my VW friend look at it. Once again, totally fine.   These guys tries to rip me off because I'm a cute girl who doesn't know much about cars. They thought they had me stuck because the car wasn't drivable. They thought I would just hand over my credit card. Not so much buddy.   The replacement plug is holding fine and worst case scenario involves a new pan for $100 and 2 hours worth of my buddy's time to fix it. $715 my ass.

It's been 2 years and that plug is still holding fine through three oil changes. Not a drop of oil spilled.

My only complaint is that they won't refill a prescription over the phone. You have to make an appointment to see someone and pay a co-pay. Other than that, this place ROCKS. I see Maria Jaten, a nurse practitioner. She's the most amazing provider have ever had and I would rearrange my schedule to see her instead of getting right in with someone else.

OK selection and prices but seems very unorganized with yarns strewn in random shelves and baskets. Some colors over here and some over there.. Good luck finding what you need.   Limited spinning fiber selection with minimum purchase on most fiber.. They come prebundled. What if I want to blend some colors?   The staff has always been pretty unhelpful and sometimes very pushy with sales.

Dear Red Lobster,   There are other flavors besides butter and garlic.   This food was horrible. The only think saving it from one star was the non-horrible service.   Those stupid biscuits were hard, heavy and taste exactly like Cheez-its.   We ordered one of the feasts and an appetizer. EVERYTHING was super greasy and drowning in butter. The scallops were rubbery and everything was so rich we left feeling like we had eaten bricks. The feeling lasted for 5 hours until I was finally able to fall asleep.   Red Lobster: Not Even Once.

So, I dated a Japanese guy in highschool. His parents owned a Japanese restaurant and I work there busing tables. I got hooked on the food. Tokyo Express has my favorite food on Earth. Well, almost. Their chicken katsu bowl is very close. Although its a bit funny because the real deal is made with pork, which is 'katsu' in Japanese, So their bowl is a 'chicken pork bowl'. LOL

LOVE LOVE LOVE this store. They have great quality boutique style clothing and jewelry for women of all ages.  The store is always clean and the staff and owner are friendly. They know almost all of their customers by name and make you feel welcome all the time.   They regularly have great and unique sales with good deals to be had for sure.

I had Ethiopian food for the first time in Solvang, CA and fell in love. I tend to like tangy food and boy did this cuisine deliver. Rich, savory, tangy flavors.. *Drools*  This place has delicious, authentic, affordable food and good service. The only thing lacking is the environment. The setting is a bit boring and dated.

We went here the our 10th anniversary (of the day we met) and were very disappointed.  1. We made a reservation and had to fight with the guy. They didnt have the time we wanted so we just said we would come in another time. Then all of the sudden, he did have the time.   2. When we got there we were told they needed a few minutes to get out table ready, and that we should hang out in the bar and get a drink while we waited. We walk in and half the tables in the place are empty. We waited 15 minutes in the bar watching the fact that every group the hostess seated was sitting in the bar also. Total Scam. They're trying to get your bill up with alcohol sales.   3. Service was good at first.  4. We split a side salad, which basically consisted of eight whole leaves of green lettuces on a plate. It was $9.  5. It took about 30 minutes fr our food to arrive, all the while the chef is yakking it up with the next table over, dropping the F bomb left and right, and talking about getting high.   6. I ordered the seafood ravioli. It was tiny, about 6 small pieces, and tasted GROSS. The sauce reminded me of salt and vinegar chips.   7. My husband ordered the toasted gnocchi. The pork portion was about 1/2 fat and was also about 2 inches cubed. The 10 little tine gnocchi tasted ok, but the chopped vegetable based was undercooked and the broth was so salty it was inedible.   8 . When we were ready to leave, it took 10 minutes for our bill to arrive.   We will NEVER go back. Over priced, disgusting scam.

Took my dog in today for a skin issue. The vet went on and on about what it could be ad why it could be that and why it might not be something else. Then he wanted to do a $150 blood test. My dog is barely a year old and a Chinese Crested who are known for having sensitive skin. Why he wanted to do a full blood panel (besides the money) is beyond me. I declined that service but did take the oral antihistamines and topical stuff.    The support staff was excellent though and the receptionist was very personable.   I just wish I could find a vet that didn't treat their business like a car mechanic... banking on your ignorance to make money.   The office could use some sprucing up for sure.  Total bill was $155.00

Excellent service for a great price. I had my machine completely cleaned and tuned up for $50. He explained some things to me to help keep it running smoothly and gave a warranty on the tension fix he did. He said if I had any more problems I could bring it back in and he'd adjust it, no charge.   Very fast turn around.

I've stopped in here twice now. GREAT DEALS! I got three glass pyrex baking dishes for $1 each.. They're $3-4 each at GoodWill. My friend bought a brand new dehydrator for $5. They have clothes, shoes , handbags, jewelry and household goodies. Its in a very affluent neighborhood so the things are very nice in there, but you're not going to find anything funky.  Plus, all the proceeds go to the rescue group and they're going be doing on-site adoptions as soon as their construction is finished. Shouldn't be too long now.

Recently changed locations in the same shopping center to a much larger pad. Much better than the smaller pad. They have lots of nice yarns and generally have a good selection of Malabrigo, which is a fav of mine.   They also have a nice selection of fiber for spinning, although it seems they recently switched to minimum prebundled packages of fiber, which I don't like.   They also have Jacquard dyes, spinning wheels (Ashford, Louet and Kromski ) and looms.

I've yelped one of the vets here, Dr. Pamela Ford and gave her 5 stars. I've also yelped a different vet and gave them 2 stars. I went in today to readdress the issue I took my dog in for a the other place. If you go and read that review, you'll see what happened there.  Well, my visit today was completely opposite from the other place.. for the exact same issue.   Other place: $200 blood test, skin scraping, possible allergy scratch test..  AAWC: Put him in a cone, wipe of his body once a day with a washcloth to remove any allergens (pollen, ect) and give him a kid's benadryl twice a day. If it turns out he needs a more intense antihistamine then that's fine, but let's start out on the most inexpensive medication and see what happens.   I used to drive to this vet from Maricopa, and now we're in Chandler. I got lazy and tried a place near my house.. Never again.   I've loved Dr. Ford since she was at Baseline Animal Clinic 7 years ago. Our cat needed a $1500 surgery and we were poor college students. She did the surgery and let us make payments.

Small, but beautiful store. Nice yarns, but the staff has been rude to me twice now. I went in to shop for a specific project so I asked a question. I got a very ambiguous answer and she proceeded to follow me around.. literally step for step. I felt like she thought I was going to steal something!   My second trip wasn't any better. I went in with a friend so she could pick a yarn so I could teach her to knit. Once again, we were followed around and watched. Not only did she follow us around, but she kept butting in our conversation and contradicting what I was saying!  Their hours are very limited. They're open Sundays and they're close to my work, but I doubt I'll ever be back.

I get there and am immediately confused. There's a display with cupcakes and a long list on the back wall. Are my choices the ones on display or from the list? I ask. She answers From the list. I order.  She says Not that one. Only the ones on the list with little dots next to them. I order again and use a special verbal code that gets me BOGO.   I ordered orange with lemon cream icing. It was good but nothing to write home about. Way too much icing that was way way way way too sweet. I scraped half off and it was better.   The place is cute, the parking as horrific. Overall ok, but the menu is confusing. I doubt I'll ever go back.

If you're been to Teharu in Tempe, don't bother going here. It's soooooo over priced its not even funny. The sushi was average, but then again I didn't taste everything because everything that looked decent was on a gold plate, which is $4.50 EACH.. and most of the time it was only three pieces. So that makes it a $12 roll.   I'll pass.

THE BEER! Seriously though, THE FUCKING BEER!   They have a bar in this WF and they also have a sommelier, but for beer. His name is James and he rocks. They have a beer flight tasting every Friday night for $5 plus lots of HTF beers.

Another person chiming in with a rave review. I had Scott out on Saturday to shampoo my front seats. My car is 4.5 years old and I eat in it all the time. There was a lot of grossness and Scott got most of it out. Because there was one spot he couldn't get, he cleaned my front floor mats.   Seriously, don't hesitate to call Scott. You can't ask for anything more here. Absolutely perfect.

Ditto on what most people have said.. the sushi is decent but the concept is so much fun! And if you're starving you don't have to wait to order and then for your food to arrive. Just sit down and start grubbing. It's also great because you don't have a true server you have to tip 20% to. We has lunch there today and ate until we were very full... like "I can't eat another bite full".. and our bill was $28.50 and $4 of that was drinks.   My main complaint is that the staff seems to hate their jobs. Not rude per se, but pretty curt. Not enough to not go back though.

Love this place! The parking sucks but if you park on the street it's much easier. It's swanky and there's great seating and the seating is open to all. You don't have to spend $500 on bottle service to have a place to sit.   They have really yummy specialty martinis like BUTTERSCOTCH!

Been here twice now and liked it both times.   I've had the biscuits and gravy both times. SUPER yummy. My husband had some sandwich (I can't remember which one but I'm sure it had bacon) and he liked it as well.   I've had the mimosas too and had to sit outside for an hour to sober up, so they're not skimping on the champagne.   Service is good, environment is good. Nothing at all to complain about. I can see us here a couple times a month for a weekend brunchy thing.

Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.   They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.   What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.  Never, EVER again.

Great beer selection for beer enthusiasts, but they're always out of everything we wanted to try. Great wings and they have $0.49 boneless wings on Wednesdays. Went on a weekend night and they had karaoke but they played only slow, sappy songs. The "rings" int he name isn't about onion rings, they don't even have those, they're talking about curly fries, which are good but the name is a bit misleading.   Overall, the "meh" with 2 stars is accurate.

It seems as though Hula's has hit their stride. I read back through some of the earlier reviews and it looks like they've fixed whatever their issues were.   I went with two girlfriends. We were greeted immediately and the host was funny and attentive. He told us the wait was 15-20 minutes. We went to the bar and 10 minutes later he personally found us and seated us.   I had a pink bikini martini.. perfect.. just perfect.  We shared an app of calamari.. AMAZING. My friends ordered two different versions of the Mahi and both raved about it. I ordered the jerk chicken and it was delicious.   Love the decor, the open sided buildings, the patio, the firepit.   I actually texted my husband while I was there to tell him how cool the place is and that we have to go back together.   With three entrees, an appetizer and five girly drinks we got out of there for under $100 with a generous tip.. which reminds me, the service was great.

The food was better than average.. Service was fine.. Beer was very overpriced and domestic beers like Sam Adams Boston Lager were included in the "Imports" menu for a premium price.  I mean a CAN of Tecate was $4.25. The bar takes up WAY too much space and the weird hostess kept walking around staring at everyone. I found the layout to be awkward and the place lacked the "fun" vibe. We ate our meal and left, having no desire to hang out for another round of overpriced drinks.

I originally thought this place would be a great weekend hangout. Went once and it was pretty good, went again and we sat for 15 minutes being ignored by multiple staff while they meandered around straightening table cloths and chatting. We tried to get their attention to no avail. We gave up and went somewhere else.

This place is back open after a run in with the liquor board.   I gave 4 stars on the condition that you go on Saturday night for happy hour.. 10pm-12am. Most appetizers (a small portion) are $1 and most drinks are half price.. Get the chilly willy.. trust me. YUM!   The only app not included in happy hour are the Monkey Balls, which are listed as a salmon, cream cheese, coconut puff.. 6 big, two bite pieces for $8. Get them anyway..   We had five drinks, four $1 apps and the full price monkey balls and our total bill was $32.   The thing that bumps it up to four stars is the decor.. Sooo cool.. We got there a bit early and were able to snag one of the leather loungy chair areas..  I hear there's a cool patio, but we dont smoke so we've never been there.

I've been to two appt here and I'm getting braces tomorrow. I can't say enough good things about this office. It's gorgeous inside with very professional and friendly staff. They have the newest technology in braces, called In-Ovation, which are little clips instead of the old-school brackets and bands. They are smaller and work faster with less discomfort.   For instance, when you tell the receptionist you have an appt at 1:30, instead of asking your name, she looks over the appt list, figures out who you probably are and asks, "Are you Jill?"   The only thing holding back that elusive 5th star is the price point. My friends braces were $3200 and mine are $5000, but I think sometimes you get what you pay for. If I'm investing this much money in something that's as much of an art as a science, I want the best.  4-28-10 - Got my braces today and I look so cute! :D

Beautiful decor, excellent service, amazing food and great happy hour specials.   Met up with a couple girlfriends for happy hour, ordered lots of appetizers - calamari, pot stickers, lots of sushi, drinks, and our bill was $62.  Couldn't ask for more - we'll definitely be back.

Went here for restaurant week. It was $30 per person for an app, entree and dessert. I know it was a 'deal' but $30 for dinner for one person is not cheap. And given the very, very limited choices for the deal I did expect normal sized portions. They were small and I left hungry.   I had some potato soup that tasted ok. Nothing amazing or anything. It was luke-warm in a boiling lava hot, very shallow bowl, so half the time was spent trying to figure out how to tilt the bowl to get a spoonful without blistering my fingers. I think they were hoping the super hot dish would heat up the soup. It did... kinda. Some bites were barely warm and some bites burnt my tongue.   For my entree I had the salmon. It was overcooked, dry and crunchy around the edges with zero seasoning. It was one of the most bland things I've ever eaten. It was sitting on some weird avocado puree which also had no flavor. The tiny side salad was good.... quinoa and a lemon vinaigrette dressing with arugula.   The dessert was an apple bread pudding which was dry and tiny. About 4 bites. It did taste good though, I just wish I wasn't still hungry after $30 worth of food.   The service was good, and almost over the top. The water glasses, like the potion sizes, are tiny, so every time I would take a sip the bus boy would be right there topping it off. Every time. It was weird. Maybe if their water glasses were larger than 8 oz (literally), my glass wouldn't look half empty after one sip.   I'll not be returning.   The only saving grace was the ambiance of the place. It was warm and cozy.

Good selection of food. Good price.. Lots of crab legs. Lots of sushi, which is ok, but its on ice so the rice gets cold.   My major beef was that none of the desserts were labeled.   We'll be back.

This shop has SUCH CUTE THINGS! I work right next door and drop in occasionally. I've bought a couple of things and they're holding up well. Their prices aren't too high like some N. Scottsdale boutiques. They're not Target prices, but the quality is there and you're not going to have to finance a new outfit. They usually have a sale rack in the back, too. Plus nice accessories too.

I went in with the expectation to find something that fit, was comfortable and didn't make my boobs look weird. Didn't find it. Everything either felt like it was cutting into my skin or the wires were too narrow or something.   I felt like the salesperson was getting frustrated with me because I wouldn't settle for something that hurt or didn't fit. She said things like, "not too bad" or "you could get away with that". For $75 I expect it to fit correctly and I also expect to not feel pressured to settle.

This Place just opened up next to the salon I work in. AMAZING! They hit the ground running,   It's a deli style, where you order at the counter and they bring you the food. I had the Grayhawk Turkey Club and the turkey was great! No packaged crap here. It was thick sliced and probably rotisserie. For the side I had sweet potato tater tots. DELISH! The have regular fries, sweet fries, tater tots, onion rings, etc.   Great looking salads, Chicago-style dogs, gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese.   The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price. It's great for dinner, but a little steep for a work day lunch.

Cute place.. but what I ordered wasn't great. I got biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were very hard and the gravy was cold. The coffee tasted burnt.   2 biscuits & gravy, a *tiny* side of hash browns and a coffee was $10. I doubt I'll go back.

Rehashing what other have said. S.L.O.W. service. I ordered a plain turkey sammie and it took 15 minutes before it was ready. I work in this shopping center and only had 20 minutes to grab a bite. I have no idea what takes so long considering they don't take the order. You just hand them your bag.   Overall the sammie was pretty good. I ordered a "skinny wich" which means they scrape out the excess bread. I like this option a lot. The bread was extra flaky and good, but they put red onions on my sammie which I did not ask for and also hate.... so much that if I ever met an onion in a dark alley would kick it's ass.

We went in not expecting much. There was ONE person working in the whole place and she spent most of the time dealing some VERY VERY drunk guy.   It's a typical neighborhood bar.   BUT THE FOOD! Hand down, the best nachos I have ever had. Ever. In my whole life. In the history of the multiverse.   Husband had the sliders and raved about them, and he's pretty much a Vulcan... very unemotional and nothing really gets him excited (with the exception of a few things), especially food. He loved these and the nachos too. We were very surprised the food was so good.   We're going back, for sure.

Ordered the biscuits and 'beer chorizo' gravy which tasted EXACTLY like the chili you would put on a hotdog. Not good.   Ordered a side of skillet potatoes... got about 3 tablespoons of the tiniest chopped potatoes ever that were SUPER overcooked. They were *literally* less than a cubic centimeter. For $3.   Friend ordered the sriracha panini and said it sucked too.   The kitschy handmade tables are interesting and the location next to the yarn store is ok, but man the food suuuuucks.

They've been open a few days and it's already FILTHY inside. Just like all their other stores. Trash all over the floors, spilled things, overflowing garbage and crap stuck all over the trashcan flap thing.   Their new sign says COFFEE SMOOTHIES AND DONUTS. I live like 1 minute away so I was excited for a place I could walk to and grab a quick iced coffee. It sucked. It was bitter and burnt tasting. And if they're going to advertise as a coffee place, maybe some actual cold creamers? And not fucking Mini Moos. The coffee mixing self service station was very dirty already and did I mention Mini Moos and not actual half and half or milk? At a place with the word COFFEE in the sign outside.   Can't comment on the donuts at this location. I have had them from other locations and they were just fine. Nothing spectacular but I would rather support a local business instead of a chain.   To the owners: PLEASE keep this location clean. It's so new! It would be so easy to maintain it! Please don't let it fall into filth like the other stores. Clean the floors. Sweep up all the trash everywhere... Wipe things off. It's pretty simple. Seeing a filthy store that sells food makes me wonder how clean the food prep area is kept.
