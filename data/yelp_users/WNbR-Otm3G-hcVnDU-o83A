After a bad experience, I was convinced by a friend to try it again (delivery), the pizza was vastly better, and the even followed the special instructions listed on the internet order. (Thanks for the awesome whale on the box!)

This will be the last time I order from here. It's one thing for a restaurant  to be hit and miss, but this is ridiculous. What was delivered  tonight was just grotesque. We order a pizza with extra cheese, extra pepperoni, what was delivered  was a spotty mess, a few random blobs of cheese here and there, huge gaps of just sauce, and the total thing undercooked. Is leaving something in the oven a little longer so terribly hard? Is an even coating of cheese really perplexing? Luckily, there are many other pizza joints to choose from.

Just ordered a cheese pizza, extra cheese. It took over an hour for them to get it to me, and when it arrived it had NO cheese on it! Seriously, you just delivered me an expensive dried out cracker with dried out sauce on it. There are 20 pizza joints in this neighborhood, congrats on being the one that can't manage to freaking make a cheese pizza.

The gelato is great, but the pizza was awful.  2nd worst I've ever had. The sauce tasted like very watered down tomato soup, I asked for extra cheese and got very little cheese at all, it was just terrible. They really should just stick to coffee and gelato.

I ordered delivery, it came very fast, unfortunately what they delivered was disgusting. I asked for no mayo, no ham, I got it with both. Not only that, the bread was wet. Completely inedible. Just threw away the sandwich, along with my money.

I love this place! My friends and I have been going here for a few years now, and I never tire of it. The owners are incredibly nice, going so far as to make special dishes just to cater to my diet restrictions. I haven't found better Vietnamese food any where else, it's truly tasty. :d

Decided to give this place a shot, wish I hadn't. Quite possibly the worst sandwich I've ever had, the bread was greasy and spongy, I had the veggie cheese steak, the 'chicken' was absolutely disgusting, it was rubbery and had a bitter after taste that I still can't get out of my mouth, and I only had a couple of bites before tossing it out. Being a veggie sandwich isn't an excuse, Cornish pasty makes fantastic things with chicken substitutes, this was just vile.  My roomie said his sandwich was edible but Subway could do better. There are tons of sandwich places around the college, pick any other one and it will be better than this.

I am torn, too many good reviews and I won't be able to get a table, not enough and they close, but I cannot lie; this place is awesome. The crepes were the fluffier I've ever had, and I adore the atmosphere.
