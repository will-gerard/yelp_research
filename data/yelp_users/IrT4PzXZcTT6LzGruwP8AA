So I went here recently  to meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat. Not only was their patio  extremely dirty but  the inside of the restaurant had this stench when you walked in.  It is definitely a cheap sports bar. My boyfriend had a burger with fries and I had the chop salad. The burger was supposed to be cooked to a medium and it came out well done, we asked the server if they could remake it and she just gave us this look and rolled her eyes. It took about 20-25 minutes for the new burger. The French fries were obviously frozen, they had no flavor and were chewy. My chop salad on the other hand had barely any salad at all and was completely covered with slimey turkey lunch meat. After we had returned the burger I had hoped to catch the sever to tell her about the salad, but she didn't even acknowledge us until 20 minutes later when the new burger came out and my salad that I only took a bite of was mush. At that point we asked to get the food taken off . We still paid for our drinks and tipped the server well, but the manager never came by once to apologize about the food. After we left we went to 5guys to get some REAL burgers and fries.

I was totally impressed with this restaurant. Me and 3 other ladies were serving jury duty and decided to eat here. We made it aware to the server that we were on a time crunch and she was extremely professional and have us perfect service. The grilled salmon that I ordered was cooked to perfection with a juicy pink center my only issue was that the portion was extremely small compared to a salad with salmon. And my favorite cocktail was their polish fix with vodka, lime juice, and muddled berries. I would recommend this place to everyone!

I have now dined at Central bistro 2 times for the Brunch menu on the weekends and 4 times for dinner in the evening. Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food.

I've been to many bars throughout the city of Phoenix and Scottsdale and EVO is definitely one that tops the cake with their attentive, humorous and experienced bartenders. It's always a very positive and enjoyable experience from the food to the cocktails! JAKE IS AN AMAZING CRAFT COCKTAIL BARTENDER! With many specialty off the menu recipes up his sleeve to surprise you with! DOMINIC IS MY FAVORITE! Every time we order the charcuterie board he goes completely out of his way to make it quite the fusion of eclectic items....From Budweiser beer, limoncello shots, gelato, bone marrow, champagne flutes of left hand nitro stout, homemade gelato, to sour pezz candy in the middle! If and when you make it into EVO ask for one of these two they are spectacular!!!! @kittencallie
