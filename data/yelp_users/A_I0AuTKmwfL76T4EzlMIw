Hands down, my favorite coffee house. Staff is awesome and always friendly. The coffee is top notch. Dog friendly too! I live really close by and will be moving soon-- but I will still get my morning coffee here for sure!! It will be worth the extra few minutes in my drive :)

I'm getting married this year and subsequently need to wear a wedding dress.... and look good in it. Joined the gym and signed up for personal training with Andrew F. The gym itself has what I need to get a good workout in. The staff is ALWAYS so friendly. I've never had a problem with unavailable equipment or space. Andrew F. as a personal trainer has been great. He always has a great attitude, and can put a smile on my face even when the going gets tough. Every session is different and I always leave feeling accomplished. He is great with making sure I have the proper body mechanics and modifies exercises for me if need be.   I'm getting stronger, I feel better about myself, and I am excited to shop for a wedding dress now! Thanks Andrew F. and 24 Hr fitness :)

From the moment I called Greg at Coyote Blinds I had a positive experience. Greg was friendly, professional, and helpful throughout the entire process. I am very pleased with the service and the finished product looks beautiful. I would definitely recommend them!!

Love this adorable breakfast/lunch place with a family feel. The food is always tasty and fresh. Coffee is great too! The staff is so friendly and I can tell there are a ton of regulars. Also, it's very reasonably priced. I will be coming here regularly and often

Tried 4 things.... all troublesome.   The spinach ravioli... from Costco!! You know the ones that come in a huge bag with the packet of cheese and herbs? I actually like those ravioli, but Cafe Forte served them in a bath of water and some of the cheese and herb packet. So gross... Chicken salad sandwich: Not a fan of the chicken salad. Had a mustard taste and had too much mayo. Not a disaster, but I couldn't eat most of it because it just had an odd taste. Chocolate truffle cake: Half baked brownie batter on a obviously pre-made white crust. I found it odd to serve a chocolate cake on a white crust... Carrot cake: Dry, probably store bought...  Never again.....

I bought a Groupon because I wanted to try a new nail place out. I get mani pedis regularly so I was looking for another regular place to get it done. Unfortunately, I did not have a great experience.  First, when I called, they told me they had separate bookings for "Groupon" customers, which already made me feel like a second class citizen.  Parking was a nightmare, very limited spaces, all being used by a valet. I had to park at Safeway across the street.  When I walked in, they had a cute little boutique area that had some cute clothes and accessories which I thought was a plus.   My manicurist was a little rude at first, did not even make eye contact with me. She had me choose colors (which by the way were very limited and old looking). Then she told me it would be $10 extra just to use their newer brand of nail polish.... seriously? Then when I told her I already had gels on my hands, she told me I would be charged another extra $10 for gel removal, even though the Groupon was for gel nails! Every other place I've gotten nails done includes gel soak off in their gel manicure. So, I was paying an extra $20 total for a mani pedi I had already paid for...  The entire time she was doing my pedicure, she was chatting with her coworkers (who by the way were not working but playing around with their own nails) about how they were starving and wanted Chipotle. It was so unprofessional and annoying!  My manicure was very basic and did not come out so great. There was no cuticle care done and the paint job was sub par.   I really wanted to relax (especially after that experience) and the facials looked inexpensive so I decided to go for a 30 min facial. They were able to get me right in. The lady who did my facial was really nice and the facial itself was not bad. However, the room was dirty and the linens did not look clean...  I will not be back again and definitely would not recommend this place to anyone...

Just came here for a post workout meal and it was delicious. I had a burger which was amazing. It was the classic burger without all the extra grease. My husband tried all 3 tacos (and so did I) and we liked all of them. Everyone around us was getting shakes and I was jealous. Next time I will be getting one!!  Super friendly staff too :)

This place is awesome. I went with my husband who loves to try new things and he had a huge smile on his face the entire time. The staff was friendly and helpful to us first-timers. The broths (we tried 2) were delicious. We had the lemongrass and curry vegetarian based broths. We ordered a bunch of meats, veggies, tofu and some noodles. We will definitely be back!!! Would be a fun place for a large group of people too!!

We have been sending our dog daughter here for months now. The staff is great and our dog has so much fun playing with the other dogs all day. They can even groom her there which is a plus! Thanks for caring for her while we work :)

Hidden gem! Cute little restaurant with a great back patio. Food is fresh and tasty. A tad on the expensive side though (paid $15 for a latte and small veggie omelette). The coffee was really good! I will probably be back!

Wow. This placed just opened and I will definitely be back.  The waiters were so friendly and eager to please.  The decor was beautifully done and fresh feeling with a traditional Mexican vibe.   Now... Let's talk food. Absolutely classic and authentic Mexican food. It was fresh and high quality. And...delicious. The tamales were the best I've ever tasted. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. My husband had the chile relleno and loved it. They have a great bar too!! The margarita was the perfect addition to my dinner.   Keep it up, La Pi√±ata!! Can't wait for my next visit!
