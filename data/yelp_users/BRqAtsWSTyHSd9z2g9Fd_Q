Its 70.00 more for the key pad.. OK fine... Then at night when i went out to get into the car there was no lights ,and the belt is hanging and they rod bends when it closes...I called and let them know and she told me that was extra for the sensor  and when I told the Women on the phone that I wanted it done today.. she got very rude with me...and Hung up on me .

We went in looking for a Table ..woman walks by us and I ask do you work here? Oh yes Starts to tell us about the table Then another woman walks up (Gloria) and then she starts to help us.. I didnt know if she was having a Bad day Or just didnt want to help,, I said, do you have any Round Dining tables and She said I don't know we have to look around .. I said You don't know your Stock?? So looked around and then went and bought it down the Street and it was 400.00 Cheaper !!

I never buy shoes at Macys becuz Nordstroms is the best for shoes and Clothes.. BUT i had gift cards so i went in to use them,, If your buying tennis shoes you have to buy them from the Finish line Dept which is leased from Macy... They were so rude to me the guy was over in The watch dept Talking and they had to call for him..He didn't say a word to me when i asked him t get the shoes i wanted ... When i told the Manager He said I know we hear this all the time .. They are a leased Dept and we  have a hard time making them following the Macy way..

From the moment we were sat, we waited for almost 10 minutes to be greeted by our server.  The restaurant was empty by the way...we were the only poeple in there.  When we asked about the menu, we got the vaguest descriptions of the sushi rolls.  Being the only table In the restaurant, we were surprised that our order took extra long.  The server never came back and out drinks were not refilled.  Part of our order was finally delivered but our appetizer was not to be seen.  We were finally told that there was a problem in the kitchen and a few minutes later the appetizer and second roll arrived. You would think. Being the only table in the restaurant, everything would be perfect.  Not the case.  Maybe that is why they are so super slow for lunch?  We'll go back to RA next time. :(

Really...? No orange juice and the ice and soda machine was down too??? Even though it's a breakfast joint I don't do coffee!  Our latest visit was totally unorganized and unprepared.  A disappointing start to what was to be a relaxing Sunday.
