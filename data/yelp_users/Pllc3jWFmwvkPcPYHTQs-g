Tracks In Wax has been a landmark here in Phoenix, and it was just today that I found out of Dennis' passing.  I spent many a day hanging out in this store when I was went to high school down the road. Admittedly, most of the time I chose hanging out at Tracks instead of making my mid morning English class.  I learned a majority of my early music knowledge thanks to those many days at Tracks.  Stopped in today, filled with nostalgia and didn't leave empty handed.  RIP Dennis.

A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!

We were on the hunt for some lunch... My lovely wife says that she wants a tuna melt. I punch it into Yelp and Morning Star Cafe' pops up number one.  I really have only one thing to say about this place...  BEST F'N'TUNA MELT I HAVE EVER HAD!  That is all.

The entrance with the awesome waterfall and great looking patio had me excited for something special! It was busy and bustling so I expected a possible stellar dining experience, I mean with a full house on a Thursday evening, it's gotta be good.  It happened to be 114 outside which might explain why all three of my beers were cool... not cold. I had the snapper tacos. Fish in Arizona is always sort of a gamble, but I have had better tacos made from fish sticks. The spice was interesting but not compelling. I didn't get to choose my tortilla preference, that's okay... but the overall dish was strangely out of place and lacking any sort of excitement or originality.  Service was good, friendly and attentive. So this in no way is a negative for the staff... unless you are the head chef.

The staff rocks! Always super friendly to my dogs, I totally trust them with my dogs whenever I leave town. Nothing but tail wags here!

I have never been so horrified in my entire life. We were lurked over by a salesman that had been drinking excessively the night before, or just finished a breakfast of vodka and potatoes... it was truly an uncomfortable experience. My wife said, and I quote... I would rather pay a few hundred bucks somewhere else, rather than ever step foot in that building again.  Hopefully I can post zero stars... I am still having nightmares due to my experience at The Big Tin Shed.

The service is pretty darn good. The wine selection is always top notch... but they lost me on the food!  Understand, I have frequented this place since we moved into the area a few years ago. I was a big fan of the handmade pasta and pesto. But is seems as if the focus on the food has slipped, and substantially at that.  I'm giving three stars because of our server, Dave. He rocks. And the wine list, pretty much rocks. I haven't checked out the new wine bar, but it looks real nice.  But, as for a meal. I'd be surprised if I go back...  ... and I am tempted to take that down to two stars... yeah... I have to give it a meh.

MonOrchid is style, class and the quintessential symbol for Phoenix culture.No matter what context the space is used for, it's always top notch.

Sometimes I wonder how a restaurant gets a great location, yet manages to stay open amidst the culinary delight that surrounds it. Downtown Scottsdale is a hotbed of food delight, to keep a good eatery open in the area would require something special, something awesome or at the very least... something.  I will start off by saying that maybe this review isn't fair, I did only have an appetizer... *takes rating from one star to 2...* and a glass of wine. But to me, first impressions are everything, and Cafe Forte failed me at hello. Not the server mind you, she was pleasant and attentive.   They call themselves a Bistro & Wine Bar... again... wine in the title, you had better have an awesome selection of wine. That was the hello that lost me.  Needless to say, the wine list left me flat... I had to settle with a Cab from Washington that was warm and disappointing. I know, they didn't make the wine, but they make the choice of what they serve by the glass, and at what temperature to serve it. There is an amazing amount of wineries out there that are producing some fantastic vino, and some of those are local Arizona wine makers that make a terrific glass of wine.   This isn't about supporting local growers (though, it's a good idea.), this is about choice. Call yourself a wine bar, then act like one. Give us a choice.  We had the hummus appetizer. It came out looking like some strange beetle had died on it's back... presentation was a bit strange, I thought my 9 year old niece was in the kitchen making food art... it was supposed to have hint of lemon, I am pretty sure they used Pledge to get the flavor...  ...Y'know... this is unfair. I will stop here. Everyone deserves a second chance. I am sticking to my guns with the 2 stars for now. I truly believe that with competition in the area, you need to step up your game, and Cafe Forte seems to be on the bench at the moment.

La Bocca has become one of my fave places to go. A few little quirks in service the first few times we went, but the atmosphere and food made up for the very minor service issues. On a side note, these issues were really no big deal, they handled them appropriately and professionally.  Best bruschetta in town, and the happy hour is awesome!  Don't think, just go.

Jess was awesome! I have been searching the valley for a long time looking for the right artist.   She is approachable, creative, and skilled. She did a great job on my new piece, exactly what I wanted.  The best part, My wife trusted her to get her first tattoo from Jess, and my wife is thrilled with the results.  Not only do I recommend Jess and Lady Luck Gallery, I would insist anyone I know to go see Jess and the guys there. I will be back for sure!

Seriously? I like my Thai food a lot, and this place was pretty much a joke. We decided to get a few appetizers and split an entree for lunch. The place was empty, for the exception of two dirty fish tanks.  The Thai rolls were overcooked and greasy, served with a side of some ketchup/duck sauce mixture that was more ketchup than anything. They were placed nicely on some shredded lettuce that they probably got from the dollar store next door.  Next was the vegetable tempura, again over cooked, over breaded and served on a bed of lettuce with that same ketchup sauce. Awesome.  The next delightful failure was the tempura tofu, that was supposed to come with peanut sauce... but consistency remained as it was served over cooked, on a bed of lettuce with that damn ketchup sauce. We did remind our server about the peanut sauce, and she did rectify the situation.   The peanut sauce was also watery and extremely lame.  We shared the yellow curry with tofu. The best part about this dish is that it DID NOT come atop the lettuce with a side of ketchup sauce!  The rice was a bit sticky, the curry sauce was missing something, I'm not quite sure what but it was missing something. The veggies were soft and over done, two of the four pieces of potato were undercooked. I guess I should look at that as a bonus.  The server was fine, a little quiet but no problems with the service. She was just doing her job.   With our "coupon" the total bill still seemed a bit high, not to mention the fact that they tax the predetermined tip with everything else.  Stay far away...

So, why does anyone eat here? If this is a true representation of New York style deli... I never want to go have real New York deli. I am sitting here waiting for our check (still) full of sadness and disappointment.

If you need a new hot water heater, Jim is the guy to call. Called in the morning, he was at my house (early I might add!) that afternoon. Clean, efficient and friendly. His prices are totally reasonable. Call Jim, you can't go wrong!

Great for the distinctive collector looking for the strange and bizarre. The Record Room has a great collection of Punk, Surf, Rockabilly, Blues and more. The walls adorned with hard to find 45's and a cool selection of T's. Super helpful and always willing to make a deal. Great place to sell your vinyl too. Check 'em out!

So glad Eastside is back! And better than ever! Full stock of hard to find LP's and 45's that I have been needing for my collection. I always stumble on something new, or something I forgot even existed. Great punk/rock selections, hard to finds and everything is priced really well... amazing selection of jazz, funk and soul LP's. Always informative and willing to help. Thanks guys!

Green Bulldog is so great! They put up with me and my rather large pack of dogs taking over the entire place for a good hour. So helpful and nice. Totally recommend for grooming or just pop in and do it yourself!

Went for the Pie He Porter, left full of sadness and despair.  Explains the Groupon.  The fact that they consider themselves a pizza joint is a disgrace to pizza makers everywhere. What was placed in front of me was not a pizza. Maybe I'm missing something, but I seriously doubt it.  First impressions were a bit on the creepy side. This being the Ahwatukee location with flashing lights at the entrance, with a Chuck E Cheese feel as you opened the doors. They have this movie theme going on that is equally disturbing. We chose to sit at the bar to avoid a 10 minute wait for a table and the option to turn our backs to the bizarre movie inspired decor.  For the record, our service was perfect. We sat at the bar and never had an empty glass. The bartender was spot on, friendly and accommodating.   Figured we would try the pretzels made with their signature crust. That should have been our warning to spend the rest of our Groupon on beer. We failed our instinct and ordered a pie.  I can't get over the fact that, A) they consider this crust worthy of anything other than concrete filler. And, B)Why in the hell was there a wait for a table?  Aside from the strange texture of the "crust", the toppings were also less than stellar with the freshness right out of the grocery store near by and designed by the mind of a child. The one good thing I can say about the toppings is that they were there, as we were hungry and needed something to actually eat.   We did manage to eat about 3/4's of our pie toppings before the realization that we were simply eating to eat, and at the same time swirling into an endless pit of depression.  Even the beer didn't help at this point. That alone speaks volumes.  To be honest, I can't even finish this review because of the trauma I am still experiencing after my visit. The sheer horror that I actually attempted to consume this thing they call a pizza and the fact that I actually paid for it.
