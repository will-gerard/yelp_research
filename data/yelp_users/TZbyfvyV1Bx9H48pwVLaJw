I have to say I definitely love Ruth's Chris- one of the best meals I've ever had- from the silky lobster bisque, the sizzling melt in your mouth filet, to the super stud waiter Sean who was fabulous all night and then surprised me with the most luscious creme brulee. Mmmmm- I can definitely be seduced with this place- I think its named after me for a reason ;).

I had great expectations for this restaurant as I have stayed and dined at various Point Resorts and restaurants in the valley and heard nothing but great reviews for Different Point of View. I even liked the cleverness of the name and was looking forward to a nice experience, but unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While the view and atmosphere were very nice our service there was inexcusably poor. We ended up with a guy named Larry who was extremely inattentive, unfriendly, and all around just unprofessional. When he would finally come around he would walk away literally after two minutes WHILE we were still speaking. He was curt and abrupt in his responses and almost hit me with a knife when he dropped the silverware and did not even excuse himself or apologize. Unfortunately his brusque, rude behavior was not merely limited to our table. However, the hostesses, bussers and other waiters around us were all great, so much so we were tempted to move to another table. Maybe he was having a bad night, but for this type of establishment and for the amount of money you're laying out you would expect half-way decent service. The food was hit and miss. The Kobe short ribs were great- flavorful and tender- the tangyness of the balsamic reduction was a nice foil against the mild sweetness of the perfectly creamy polenta. Consequently, we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good, but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed. The central elements of our meals, the steak and halibut, were both flavorless and overdone though the supporting casts of sauces and sides were very flavorful and well prepared. The shrimp with the lemon fennel reduction was fabulous, but it could not mask the dryness and lack of flavor in the halibut. The steak was tough and flavorless and when sent back returned somewhat less tough, but still flavorless. Definitely not at all in the caliber of a Ruth's Chris, JnG, or even Fleming's or the Keg. The creme brulee was nice though nothing outstanding and the chocolate amandine had a flat pre-packaged taste- after a few bites we left the remainder. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food.

A friend and I went here for the two for $20 and honestly it wasn't even worth that. When we ordered they were out of all but one of their soups at 6:00pm on a weekday. Ok- well interesting but not that big a deal. Then we waited for 40 mins. for us to get our food and when it finally arrived the steak I ordered as a medium came out as a well-done piece of grey inedible leather. Of course I had to wait for them to re-make one, but luckily they brought the appetizer that should have been brought out first at the same time as the steak- that way at least I could fill up on mediocre boneless chicken wings and be full by the time my actual meal was brought out. No they did not offer me a free dessert, but the manager gave me a $5 coupon off my next visit. I asked to use it right then because I'm not sure when if ever I'll be back. The waitress was nice and apologized, but the truth is I've never been impressed with the less than mediocre bar food from this chain.

Bleh! I can't believe this place has so many good reviews. The quality of the food is very poor (I think their appetizers come from the freezer section of the grocery store), anne the preparation is even worse- meat and beans have hardly any flavor, and the fried items are cold, limp, and greasy. You'd think that would be enough, but no- the menus, table, and silverware were dirty! I would've walked out, but it was someone's birthday. Service was mediocre. The only things positive were some of the decor and rooms to facilitate large parties.

There may be better Thai food out there but I haven't found it. I really like Thai food so I've been to Basil Thai, Benjarong Thai, Thai Elephant, Thai Rama, Papaya Thai, Mike's Thai, and Pink Pepper Thai among others and always end up walking away thinking "not as good as Mint Thai". The curries at Mint Thai all have a nice balance of flavors and heat and the spicy peanutty sauce in the Rama Beef here is more substantial and has a creamier consistency than other places which I personally prefer. I've tried several dishes here and you really can't go wrong because even those that may not be favorites are always well executed. I have had better Pad Thai but honestly its not what I usually order here anyway, and I agree that there is definitely something lost in the take-out here (not sure why as the leftovers- if there are any- are always yummy). For dessert- the creamy coolness of the coconut ice cream with the sweet warmth of the mango sticky rice is a luscious combination.

Sad to say I used to like this place, but had to downgrade my review. Repeated inconsistent service and food quality have made this place hit or miss. I honestly thought they must have sold the place or gone under new management, but I spoke to the owner who told me she has owned it for the last ten years. Startlingly, she told me herself a lot of the issues come from cutting corners to save money. Twice we ordered red curry to go which is extremely liquidy/almost soup like. The literally packed it in a tin foil homemade "boat" in a typical square styrofoam to-go box so of course I didn't make it back to work with it it spilling out everywhere all over the bag. When I called and spoke to her and asked get about the packaging she first said that is how they always do it. I explained to her we have ordered many times before and it has always come in a styrofoam cup with a lid and she said that they only do that for the entree not the lunch special because the cups are more expensive. I kindly tried to explain there is no way you can expect a liquid to not spill out of a box that is not sealed. Needless to say customer service was not a major concern for her. Let me add hat they also have recently raised there prices again and reduced their portion s izes. The amount of rice is only about enough for one person and they charge extra if you ask for more rice. On a good day the food has lots of flavor and is well prepared which is why I still gave it any stars at all.

$1 surcharge for debit/credit for over-priced tacos?! No thanks! FYI- no sign posted or anything advising you of the charge until the tell you when you pay. On the contrary the signs say they gladly accept cards.

Crappy pedicures and poor customer service, but Cute designs! The patterns are creative and unique and they are always changing it up! Other salons copy their designs, and they know this so they also know they don't have to care about how they treat people or their level of service. Like the hot guy in school that know's he's hot, so if you walk off he knows there are ten others behind you waiting to take your place. Of course upside is when you walk around with him all your friends are complimenting you on how hot he is. I've seen them nick a lady who was clearly upset, and totally not care. Luckily, they have been decent to me, but I've seen the take-it-or leave it attitude and eye-rolling demonstrated towards other customers and there always tends to be that feel of slam-bam-thank you-ma'am. All that would normally turn me off completely, but some of the designs are just straight up cool and I haven't found another place that can compete for the price. Because the actual pedis are mediocre at best- I usually go and just get the paint/design done. That way I'm in and out and I don't leave feeling frustrated and unsatisfied ;).

Been here a few times and unfortunately not impressed. They only take cash, service is not especially friendly or helpful, and they are kind of over-priced. Tried several of the baked items and was somewhat underwhelmed- honestly though that may be because I saw them on a TV show and had high expectations- but I have given this place more than just one shot. Bottom line, they are okay but not great and not worth the price.

If you've ever had to pay to get your car repaired you know there are a lot of shady places out there that try to take advantage of you- Especially if your a woman! Well by the end of my experience with Ken at Crown Collision I wanted to take advantage of him. JK- I did want to hug and kiss him though ;).  So freak incident where some flying object (probably a large rock) hits my passenger mirror on the freeway and next thing I know the whole housing is hanging off flailing around like a frog in boiling water. Of course my insurance deductible is $500 and you know they always count any claims against you so I decide to check into just finding a mirror and replacing it myself. I do my homework like a good little girl but quickly realize this isn't just a screw-it-off, screw-it-on kind of thing so I decide to take it in and get some estimates. I had been to Crown Collision years ago when one of my power windows was broken and I remembered a really nice guy who helped me- He said all I needed was a clip and fixed it for free. That has always stuck with me because I've always appreciated how kind he was to me. (I would've written a review then but that was back in the day grandma Buick car and before Yelp). I decide to drop in and right away there are at least 10 awards from AARP for Best Shop. Two minutes after I'm checked in and I'm greeted by Ken who checks out the damage. First thing he does is cut off the mirror so it doesn't keep damaging paint. Then he looks up the part on the computerand then shakes his head and says "there's no way that thing is that much". He shows me OEM Nissan parts listing as $250 or so. He says, "that's no more than an $80 mirror as the day is long." Of course having already looked into it myself I know about the outrageous Nissan price and that I can get one on Ebay for around $60- so I knew he was being honest (yay!). Ken offered to find a used part and discussed various options with me and most importantly he quoted me a fair price for parts and labor and no pressure. I have to say his kind smile and demeanor not only made me feel comfortable, but trust him too. When the part arrived Ken called me and said he could probably have it done on my lunch break. I run over there and they take it back and Ken says the good news is the part matched my paint but bad news was once  installed some of the gears to move the mirror were stripped. He offers to keep looking to find another part local and says he thinks there might be one up the street so he's going to run over there and check. Next thing I know I'm reading my magazine when he come up to me and says "Here you go. All done! It matches the paint and probably looks better than your other mirror". I was so pleased and surprised I wanted to kiss him! Ken is the BEST and definitely the KING at Crown Collision!

Love this little piece of Italy in the valley! Great gourmet deli meats and cheeses and Italian imports of all kinds- including gems like squid ink pasta and European Nutella. All the sandwiches I've tried are good, but I prefer the hot (usually steak with mushrooms and onions or sausage). The home-made raviolis are large delightful pillows of deliciousness, and the meatballs are nice and big. I sometime order one a-la-carte, and sprinkle on the peperoncino and parmigiano reggiano. For the dessert try the Napoleon!

Some of the best pizza in the valley, and their Chicago-style pizza is better than pizza I've had in Chicago! Their signature sauce is on the sweet side which I like because it reminds me of my mom's home-made sauce. I usually prefer thin crust pizza, but their deep dish here is delish as well. My sis loves the spaghetti calzone with ricotta- word to the wise the small is actually pretty large. Great- now I'm craving some Spinato's! Now that's amore :)!

Who knew we had this hidden little Italian gem out here in the East Valley! Went here on a whim because I saw the Yelp deal, but it would've been worth paying full price for the taste and quality for such lusciously creamy gelato. I love chocolate, but I'm picky and can't stand when there's an artificial/chemical aftertaste. I was not disappointed- the dark chocolate was deep, rich and satisfying. They also let us get half and half flavors which many other places won't do.  Bonus- they have a little Italian store/deli with imported meats and cheese. Can't wait to try out both sides- will definitely be back.

Yummy Goodness!!! The Mushroom Walnut soup is Cozy Delisciousness (trust me on this) and the Hot Flaky Pasties are comfort food in a crust! Love the dark English Pub feel and the cool vibe of the place. The white candles in the old wine bottles are a nice rustic touch and add to the ambience. The one draw back is that the service can be hit or miss- but a plus is that if you don't want to be dine in you can order half-baked pasties to go for $6. I told an Australian friend I went here, and she said she had just been there a few days before and she could literally eat one of their pasties every single day. She loves them so much she wanted me to go again with her the next day!

DO NOT DO DELIVERY!! Can't comment on the food because we never received it. After waiting over an hour with no food- it took another 30 mins. to get thru on the phone since no one answered and the message box was full. When I did finally reach someone the customer service was horrible. When I explained the situation she told me that the driver hadn't even left yet with our order because he got lost on the previous order. I told her okay but I would need to cancel my order then and she said I needed to speak to the owner to cancel and when I politely asked to speak to the them she hung up on me!!! After I kept calling back she finally answered and said I had to contact the online company to cancel the order so my credit card wouldn't be charged for food we never got! Worst Ever!

Loved the salsa bar with all kinds of fresh and unique salsas! Pecan, Jicama, Peanut, and Radish to name a few and I'm not usually a fan of tomatillo but it was really good. I had the steak and the black chicken mole tacos- the steak was on the dry side and lacked flavor but the salsa helped kick it up the few notches to where it needed to be. The space is small and tight, but with a cool modern Mexican decor. It looks like there is room to expand which I hope they get around to soon. We went for lunch and it was crowded and cramped. Service was good and attentive.

I don't know why I haven't done a review sooner, but we love Rigatony's! Service is usually great (Clayton is the best!), and we have never had a bad dish here. The short ribs and seafood dishes are delicious, but we always seem to wander back to their signature baked rigatony with sausage. The antipasto salad is one of the top restaurant salads and the patio is lovely during the spring. They also regularly support community agencies like Paz de Cristo, and their generosity is what spurred us to seek them out. We are so happy we did!

I was excited to try this place out especially because I'm all about mom n pop type places. Its also down the street from my office so I was hoping to find a great new lunch place. First time I went with a co-worker the restaurant was open but you wouldnt have been able to tell from the inside. It was darker than a night club inside and they weren't "ready" to serve only but a few things off the menu. The poor waitress was inexperienced, and surprisingly had very little knowledge of Cuban food and had to keep running to the back to ask questions. We decided to leave and try somewhere else and maybe come back when they were more established. I ended up coming back a few weeks later with another friend and tried the buffet and was less than impressed. Pretty much typical buffet- a bunch of mediocre food with little flavor. The fried food that should have been light and hot was cold and greasy. My dreams of yummy sweet and slightly salted tostones were crushed because of course they didnt serve them on the buffet (really?) and again the place was still not prepared to service patrons. We had to ask for place settings, and there were several dishes with no serving spoons (I wasn't sure if they wanted you to use the same spoon for multiple items, but um no thanks). The one thing that was actually good were the black beans- nice smoky flavor, but unfortunately for me that's probably the last item when I think of Cuban food I actually really care about. Too bad there's not much that's sweet about Azucar.

We wanted to like this place, but Danielle E. is right on. I felt bad for the young guy because he seems nice, but he has absolutely no clue about customer service, the menu, the food, or how to be a waiter. We should have taken the hint to leave after we had to seat ourselves, but we had the Living Social deal too so decided to give it a try. Alas, we had the same issue with the Living Social deal and kind of felt like we were getting screwed with so may exclusions- then when we finally decided on ordering the special roasted chicken (that was advertised on big sign right by the door)- the waiter told us they were out. They were also out of one of the appetizers, alfajores, and all the other desserts except for two. Interesting since it was 6:30 on a Saturday night and there was only one other couple in the entire restaurant. Sadly dinner was not even worth it with the "deal" we were supposed to be getting- my flavorless lomo saltado mix of steak and shrimp literally had three small over-cooked shrimp on top of the chewy over-cooked steak. The person I was with had the tallarines with shrimp and they were so disappointed with the food and the experience that they said they will never come back. We wanted to go up to the other couple and tell them if they want real Peruvian food and decent service to go to El Chullo.

This place is a hole in the wall in every way.  If you blink while driving you might miss it, but I drive by four Filiberto's to get here and get out of the car because the Breakfast burritos are some of the best I've had. Someone on here recommended the Machaca and they were right. Tacos are really good- street style like the DF. Pastor which can be fatty is leaner and a larger chop than a lot of places, but wish it has pineapple. Minus star is for issues you find at a lot of hole in the walls- mediocre service, sign says they have a special but then they say they don't have it today, no salt packets because supposedly they weren't delivered, salsa bar not restocked, ripped booth covers- of course most of that can be avoided if you just order take out. The food is worth it. Plus Giant burger is just a few doors down and you can pick up a slice of pie :).

Unfortunately, I have to echo ask the comments about the rude service. I used to like Jimmy Johns, but the customer service from the manager Thomas was horrible. He told me they do not deliver to our office because of the metal detectors, and that we have to go down and pick it up. This is untrue because as I explained I had ordered from them multiple times previously. He then said it takes too long for them to deliver to us when they have five other orders to get to. I ended up canceling my order, and granted they may not need my $10, but you would hope they would at least be honest and nice. No need to spend money here for over-priced mediocrity when there are tons of other sandwich places around.

Salsa is good. Food is hit or miss, but sadly all the reviews about the service and the long waits and the nazi rule about not seating your party are all true. It looks nice, but the experience leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of salsa can cover it up.

Yummy gelato!! Friendly staff!! Open late!! What's not to love? Toasted Marshmallow and Chocolate is just like a S'more. Chocolates are all rich and creamy, but Panne cotta, Creme brulee, and Vanilla bean are my faves. Love Frost! Tip- call ahead for the mini-gelato tree (24 different flavors).

Tried to stop in for lunch, but sadly disappointed! The curly haired blond guy was the most rude/inhospitable person I've encountered in a long while. Apparently he doesn't know how long they smoke their brisket or much at all about the menu, but after I order a Sonny's spud (advertised on a big paper sign behind the register) all of the sudden (conveniently after I try to use my Yelp deal) he says they are out of potatoes- and even though he just told me they were cooking they won't be ready for another 2 hours. I'm not sure on what planet it takes over 2 hrs. to bake a potato, but at that point I didn't care so I just left. I understand running out of items, but I don't understand an unnecessarily rude or mean demeanor. I don't know if he was just ignorant or rude or both, but how are you not friendly or hospitable at a BBQ place?  I ended up driving out of my way and going to a chain restaurant (Famous Dave's) and had the absolute opposite experience- the guy was so kind and friendly and even jumped around the counter to open my door like a gentleman that I wanted to hug him! Next time I  want an independent BBQ place l'll make the trek to Texas BBQ House or Little Miss where customer service and friendliness are a priority.

If you are looking for good Mexican food in a fun atmosphere in the East Valley this is it. Chips & Salsa and beans and rice here are solid, but the Talpiquena (carne asada and shrimp sauteed with mushroom and garlic) is deliciosa! Most of the entrees are served on huge plates that come piping hot to the table. Service is hit or miss, but most of the guy servers are really good. The homemade flautas are yummy as well.

I seriously don't understand these positive reviews- they seriously must be out of their minds. We tried several different flavors and sadly I wouldn't want to go back even with a discount. Just about any grocery store's cupcakes taste better than these and that is exactly what they reminded us of. The red velvet and basically all their chocolate cupcakes have mini chips chocolate chips in them- I know your thinking "oh yum, nice little surprise" but that is until you find out they are so COLD and HARD that you could chip a tooth on one- so basically you have soft somewhat dry cake with gravel bits covered in heavy greasy icing. You are way better off with Top It Cupcakes or driving out to Scottsdale for Sprinkles- heck your better off going to Costco.

Had wanted to try them again since they re-opened, but sadly disappointed! Walked in at 8:30pm and they said they were closed. Then they said they could do take out. Really?!! You have an open sign out that says you don't close until 9:00pm and instead of taking customers you turn them away?! We can't seat you, BUT we can still make the food and take your money if you take it and leave. No apology or explanation or come back and we'll give you a free dessert- anything? Again 8:30PM not 8:55pm- Needless to say we won't be back. There are too many other options with better service and the food is just a cheaper copy cat of Tia Rosa's around the corner. I'll pay more for some place that actually cares about customer service.

Meh, not impressed and kind of over-priced for what you get. Ordered two different empanadas and the pozole. One of the empanadas was way over done and the other was just right which was of course the one that came with beans in it which I didn't like but was recommended. The pozole was beef and reminiscent of canned beef vegetable soup. Overall expected better, but may try them again.

Just remembered this place because of the cute name and finally stopped in one afternoon for lunch and am so glad I did. Nice modern decor for a Chinese take out place and clean comfortable atmosphere made me almost want to eat in. Customer service was great- very friendly and he offered to substitute the salad for an egg roll (small but tasty- and had  some chicken so not all cabbage). Prices are around $6 for lunch and they offer a varied menu from Mongolian Beef to Red Curry. Food was all very fresh. I had the Shrimp Pad Thai- plenty spicy and the shrimp were cooked perfectly- not overdone like so many other places. Crab puffs were a little too sweet and not as light and flaky as I prefer but at least they actually had some imitation crab and weren't straight cream cheese. I'll definitely be back. *Manager said they deliver locally so I'll have to try that out too when I'm stuck at work.*

A cute, fun place to go to cool off with some Italian ice in this AZ heat. Heck, I'd go even when it's 40 degrees outside. I'm typically not a big fan of Bahama Bucks/Sno-Cones etc. and am more of a Gelato girl, but I was pleasantly surprised by the yummy deliciousness! I really liked the coconut and strawberries and cream Joe-lattie style! Some friends had cookies and cream and peanut butter and those were yummy too. Decor is cute, place is clean, staff is nice and friendly- I'm a fan. Will definitely be back :)!

5 WELL-DESERVED STARS!!!! El Chullo is a small and unassuming hidden gem so we ended up passing it and having to turn around, but it was so worth it! Honestly, we had reservations and a Living Social deal at another Peruvian restaurant but ditched that place to come here because of the great Yelp reviews and SO GLAD WE DID! This place has both the best Peruvian food and the friendliest service of any Peruvian restaurant there has been in the valley for at least the last 20 years. We've tried them all (including some out of state) and by far this place has the best alfajores we've ever had- luscious creamy dulce de leche sandwiched between delicate creamy colored disks of flaky, buttery, goodness- oh my!  I'm still dreaming about them. The lucuma ice cream and chicha morada are also must tries. The chicha morada was refreshingly smooth and light- almost like a fine wine. We also had the appetizer sampler, the tamal, the aji de gallina, the jalea mixta, and the bistek and tallarines verdes. Next time we'll order the papa rellena and/or the yucca on their own (the sampler sizes were pretty small) and skip the tamal. The warm welcoming friendliness of the family/staff made our experience such an exceptional one that we ended up ordering a lot more than we planned and enjoying ourselves immensely. We love supporting family-owned businesses and Esperanza and Chef Omar and his cute sisters are so nice they make you want to come back again and again- well for them and the Alfajores :). I only wish it wasn't 30 mins. away, but so good it's worth the drive.

The shop is nice and clean inside, but sadly my acrylic nails are uneven and they couldn't do any of the designs I wanted. One was a Robin Moses design off Pinterest, but the other three were their OWN designs from their book. I left having to get my nails finished somewhere else. I gave then a star for at least trying. They didn't do a hand massage or lotion or anything with a full set.

Update- the manager Tammy refunded my money, but requested several times that I delete my review if they did so. I explained that I did not feel comfortable doing so because my original review was an honest expression of my experience  but that I would update my review. She and her co- worker asked a total of 8 times for me to delete my review and tried to insist I do so right then while she had my ID and credit card while showing back and forth in Vietnamese. Luckily I had someone with me witnessing what occurred. Originally I planned to give them another star, but the shady way it was handled deserves minus stars!

Yumalisciousness! I'm not even a big sandwich person, but Ike's definitely has my love. The Dutch Crunch bread is the bomb and the dirty sauce is just garlicky goodness! Staff is fun and friendly and the menu offers one-of-a-kind exciting combinations! All sandwiches are hot and made to order and customized to your level of awesomeness. This place is always packed at lunch time so plan accordingly.

Rented a Penske truck and tow dolly from this location and they were great! Customer service was great and this was probably the smoothest rental I have ever done. I think we had Billy helping us too and he was super nice and friendly and up-front and honest. Really appreciated the nice experience! Definitely recommend!

We just tried this deliciously authentic Mexican seafood restaurant tonight, and left muy feliz :)! Chips (thin and crispy) and salsa were good (better than a lot of chains), and they took care of a specialized order of adding shrimp to a fish filet with mushroom cream sauce. The shrimp were big and not over-cooked. We went on the weekend and the live mariachi music was fun, but super loud (and I usually love loud music). Service was friendly and prices were really reasonable! We'll be back soon!
