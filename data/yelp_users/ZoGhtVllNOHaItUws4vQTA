Went in with my girlfriend  and she was looking to get a trim after waiting about 30 minutes they tell us they don't cut extensions...why didn't they tell us that before waiting 30 minutes.....? Ok...

I came across this place one day when I was looking for a barbershop closer to my home. The location very convenient its near ASU and the light rail. I can also drive there in less than 5 minutes. The wait was not very long at all and they had several tv's playing several sports channels which is great. The overall vibe was really chill and the 3 employees there were friendly. I got a haircut from the gentleman named JJ. He did and amazing job on my cut, it was probably the freshest hair cut I have ever received, no joke. JJ took his time to to ensure his work perfect or close too. I wish i could have found this place sooner. JJ was also able to hold a good conversation unlike most babrbers who kind of just make akward attempts. Overall i liked this shop and very much appreciated the professionalism the employees of this establisment exuded.

I work right next to this place so it's very convenient. Mary and Gordon are all around really cool people and they make good breakfast and lunch. My favorite is the chorizo burrito supreme.

The barista at the Starbucks there either does meth or was just enjoying  making ugly faces at me and they have rotting old pumpkins.

Came here after my friend saw some foul stuff at Pho Nhat on Apache and this place definitely made up for that incident. Food here at Pho Tempe was perfect. We were the only ones in there so everything came quick. The egg rolls were so good and my pho was amazing I'll def go back soon.

I recently moved to Camden Sotelo in May. So far it has been a great experience. You can tell Amanda and Albert really care about the community. Amanda and Albert act very swiftly when things need to get done. I recently witnessed Albert walk out of his office in 110 degree weather to pick up trash that some person literally just left on the ground, that's what you call a great property manager. The only one issue that I have is the  inconsiderate neighbors who use the hallway trash as their own personal trash cans and stink up the hallway....other than that I have been very pleased with management and the community overall.

The service was really good, the staff was excellent, the place it's self was nice and they had good outdoor seating. Although the food was pretty much white washed but what do expect in old town, not Mexican food necessarily.
