I would add more stars if I could. Dr engle and staff were seriously amazing. I had my wisdom teeth taken out on Friday and they went through all my options and costs very thoroughly. I ended up getting a dry socket (which is probably the worst pain I've ever had in my life) and dr. Engle came in on a Sunday afternoon to help relieve the pain. Again it started really really hurting and he had me come in before they opened and helped relieve my pain. I am soooo thankful that I never have to go through this again, but if I did, I would come back here. Thank you doctor.

I am getting ready to move out of Autumn Creek Apartments this week. the only reason I am moving is because I finally bought a house. I never once had an issue with Autumn Creek. The staff was always super friendly and helpful. My neighbors were always nice and quiet.  I had one issue with a tennant above me that was very loud once and the staff took care of the situation right away and there was never an issue again.  It is an older building but it was perfect for me.  Zero complaints about this place. If i ever needed to rent again, i would come back here. :)   -Dayna

This company is a JOKE. they sent me a "flat rate" bill for taking vitals that was $700. along with a note that states they do not provide ICD-9 codes so that you can bill your insurance. I called my insurance company and they told me that i could get a copy of the report that they took on me (basically a blood pressure report) and send that in and bill it myself. Will write another review once i hear back from my insurance company that is working on the claim that this place GUARANTEED would not be covered.
