Strange as it may feel to order something called the "Philly Steak Pita"--on the same menu with the "Macro Platter" (steamed veggies and tofu)--the Philly is one of the best items you can get here. It's finger-searing hot, a dripping mess of thin-sliced beef with grilled peppers, onions, and melting mozzarella cheese, a satisfying handful of goodness that's begging for an extra dollop of hummus or garlic sauce to create a stream of perfect bites. All for less than 7 bucks.  I've been going to Pita Jungles for at least 15 years now, starting at the location by ASU and now mostly at this Chandler location. It's our standby when we want something on the healthy side. Very few items on the menu have ever disappointed, and the bang-for-the-buck here is high.   Beyond the Philly, my favorites include: grilled veggie salad, chicken combo, and the lavosh shawarma wrap.  I'd agree that the service can occasionally be a little snooty, trying to be a bit too-hip-for-you, but generally, we get good service here.

After all these years, Rosa's is still one of my favorite Mexican places in the Phoenix area. I've been going here for well over 10 years, and we still make occasional trips to old town Mesa for their signature meats.  Our favorites: * Plato de carne: basically a huge fajita plate with better meat--you get your choice of meat with grilled veggies, beans & rice, and tortillas * Chicken chimichanga: their chicken is marinated and always fabulous, and I'm a sucker for a good chimi * Salmon tacos: big chunks of salmon, white cheddar, and homemade mango salsa--my wife's staple.  I give it 4 stars since those salmon tacos have lost some of their original luster. They used to bring tears to your eyes, but I think they're skimping on the salsa a bit nowadays.  Service is consistently good, as are the chips and salsa. The beans, as others have mentioned, are superb. You won't leave any on your plate.

Locally roasted beans. Really great espresso. French pressed coffee. Made-from-scratch baked goods. Servers know coffee. Fun jazzy soundtrack. Free WiFi.  What more do you need? I've been going to this place on and off for ten years, and their espresso has always been among the best. I just wish I would've been smart enough to buy a house closer by!

Thai Rama is our regular Thai place. We get it regularly (usually do takeout) and we pretty much always order: Evil Jungle Princess (curry) and Kwediew Kaprow (better known as pad kee mow), both with chicken.  Intrigued by a name like Evil Jungle Princess, aren't you? This is a fabulous, creamy, coconut milk-based curry, loaded with veggies. The sauce is so good you'll drink it off the plate.  Kwediew Kaprow includes the flat rice noodles, lightly spiced, but a real delight...one of the best pad kee mows I've had anywhere.  Prices are roughly 10 bucks a plate for dinner, and even cheaper for lunch. This place makes a great lunch up to 6 or 8 people if you're in the area. Highly recommended.

This place has been on my "to try" list for about 10 years, and after a Saturday afternoon game at Tempe Diablo, we finally swung by.   The meal was delightful. We ordered a small hummus, the falafel plate, and the "istanbuli combo:" chicken, lamb, and kafka kabobs. Everything, including the lentil soup and salad, was fresh and loaded with flavor. The falafel might be the best I've ever had.  All for 23 bucks before tip--some serious bang for your buck.   Service was very friendly. We will definitely be back.

Everything tasted too artificial.  After a handful of trips to Kokomo, we got a buy-one-get-one-free coupon for Golden Spoon and decided to give it a shot.   I got cookies'n'cream and chocolate malt with almonds and brownie. My wife ordered strawberry and cake batter with cookie dough.  The CnC and the strawberry tasted really artificial...after a few bites of each we just couldn't continue. The chocolate malt and cake batter, however, were both pretty good.  The "regular" size is generous and a decent value at $3.25, but toppings are $0.90 each. With the coupon, we spent about $6, about the same that we usually spend at Kokomo with no coupon.  Kokomo knocks our socks off on every trip. My socks remained firmly in place at the Golden Spoon. Service was friendly enough, but we won't be back.

I've been daydreaming about a build-your-own burrito place for years, but I haven't hashed out a way to properly account for the mass of meat (pricey) versus rice and other ingredients (cheap). Regardless, the place would be a mess.  Kokomo stopped daydreaming and created the perfect frozen yogurt destination: grab a way-bigger-than-you-need cup, pump as much of as many flavors of yogurt as you want, and top it off as you please. Who can make a better dessert for you than YOU?  Plus, the product itself is so tasty. It almost melts -too- fast.  Two quick tips: * Do not park your land yacht in the go-cart-sized parking area that supports Kokomo and the 18 businesses at the south end of this strip mall. Park by the Bank of America and hold off your headache until you start spooning your frozen yogurt too quickly into your grill. * If you want time and space to create your perfect confection, do not show up between 6 and 8pm on weekends. During this rush hour, the place is filled (literally, the line fills the place all the way to the door) with unparented children who won't give you time or the space to craft your chilly concoction. Before or later, you'll have elbow room and time to rotate between toppings and yogurt should choose multi-layering.
