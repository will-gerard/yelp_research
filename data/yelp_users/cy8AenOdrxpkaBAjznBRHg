I am usually anti-dealership because I have always perceived taking my car to a dealership to be much more expensive than taking it to a random shop to be fixed.  I have a 2001 New Beetle, and my first experience with Camelback VW was a couple years ago, when I went in to get the car's window fixed.  All went well.  Looking to save cash though, I went to a different local shop when it was time to get my car repaired so it could pass emissions.  That place got me to pass emissions for around $350 by replacing the O2 censor on my thingy-ma-bob.  (Hey, I'm a girl, sorry).  It was certainly better than replacing the entire catalytic converter for around $900.    This year, I've been investing in getting some work done on the car.  I went in for a wheel balance and oil change a couple weeks ago.  The service guy, Frank, found a bunch of stuff wrong with the car's suspension.  The dreaded catalytic converter replacement still needs to happen, too.  I decided to start fixing the suspension one bit at a time since a lot needs to be done.  Frank quoted me for around $550 for that day's work and sent me home with a nice, clean Subaru loaner car for the night.    I came back the next day to a car that had new arm bushings (hope that's what those thingies are called) in addition to my originally-planned oil change and wheel balance.  They took a bit too long to get the car finished and returned to me.  Frank felt bad for making me wait and knocked some extra cash off the bill and didn't charge me for some of the work that was done.  So I saved around $200 on the overall bill.    I plan to go back to have more work done on the car soon.  I prefer Camelback VW for oil changes because the quickie-lube places just don't have a knack for doing things right...but that's another review for another time!

One star for the massive headache I got after I ate the food... MSG?  Not sure.
