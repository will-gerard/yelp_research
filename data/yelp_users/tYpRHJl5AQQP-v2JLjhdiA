So happy I listened to Yelp and checked this place out. I've been beyond nervous to take Max somewhere new after the last place made him look unrecognizable (my coworkers thought a adopted a new dog, no joke). So for months now I've been dreading finding a new place, and kept coming back to the awesome Yelp reviews for this place and I'm glad I did.   The place is cute and you're greeted by a super friendly staff which is a big one when you're about to care for my child pretty much. She asked what I wanted and I showed her a picture and also a pic of the disaster that happened last time. She also showed me the differences in the lengths to make sure we were on the same page.   I was nervous to pick up my little stud, but as soon as I saw him it all went away. If you're a pet owner you get my worry. He looks perfect!!! They did exactly what I wanted, I couldn't be more pleased.   We've definitely found our new groomer!

Just dropped in real quick to try out some Quest bars and the guy there was really knowledgable and friendly. I'm hate walking into health stores like this and feeling like someone us over my shoulder like GNC sometimes but they weren't like that at all. First time here and I'm sure I'll be back.

I go to Gavin for my hair (cut and color)  and he'll work with you on what you want and make sure you like the outcome. He's done black, brown and blonde on my hair and puts up with my hair ADD as I tend to want to change it up a lot lol. Makes you feel comfortable and does a great job!

So where do I start... First off the room was a little pricey for what it was. I'm sure it was because of the location, but to pay a high price and to then have to pay $21 a day for parking is ridiculous! Also when I checked in the girl wasn't the friendliest and when I asked about parking she just pointed and never even mentioned the cost which I feel they should. The only great thing about this place was the view, which was really nice from the bar / lounge area. The room was clean and the bed was comfy, but the room did have an odd smell to it. It looks like they are doing some renovations so it might be nicer down the road. Also, when we called the front desk the 2nd girl I was handed off to was not friendly at all. Customer service is huge with me so that's a big downfall! Honestly the location is great, but I doubt I'd stay here again when I have to pay extra for parking and the prices were already high. It could have been due do the events going on as well, but I'm not sure.

Always friendly and quick! I love my milk tea with boba, just wish it was closer to where I live. Being from San Jose I'm use to one on every corner. I could honestly drink this everyday!

Place just reopened and it's called Surfer Express. Free car wash today you can't beat that!!! The guy which I'm assuming was      management or the owner was super friendly and wasn't pushy at all about their monthly plans, which I love! It's quick, close by and super reasonable so I'll be back. Oh and he mentioned it's all new updated equipment.

Worse service EVER!!! Came in and the hostess was rude, but we let it slide. The 2 guys working offered us miso soup and brought us our drinks, but our waitress was extremely inattentive. We ordered our food and within an hour we were checked one 0 times! No apologies on why our 2 rolls we're taking so long and no asking if we wanted another drink. The place was dead so there is no explanation as to why we received such horrible service, it doesn't take much effort to check on your tables when the place you're working at is dead. You'd think you'd try harder when it's dead to make the extra tip. It came to the point where we couldn't even pay our bill because she never came out to check on us so we sadly had to leave a $20 which meant leaving her a tip she DID NOT work for or deserve. We will never go back and make sure our friends to not check this place out. Don't waste your time!!!

I've never heard about this place until I had to go here for class. I ended up loving it out here, it's very peaceful and you get to escape from the city. There are a bunch of areas to go and venture off to or you can sit on the benches and watch the ducks and geese or you can even go fishing. It's a great place to even jog or walk your dog! I wish it was closer to where I live, but I will definitely be back.

I honestly would just give this place 5 stars based on customer service. The man that helped me out (may have been the owner or manager) was extremely friendly and explained the menu to me. He also gave me a taste of their Brazilian sauce, which is delicious and I got to dip my sweet potato fries in. I ended up getting a Tuscan chicken panini which was yummie, but I want to go back and try out their Brazilian chicken grilled flatbread because this sauce is delicious. I know I should be staying away from bread so maybe I'll try a salad instead.  Either way the service was great, place was clean and for a quick yummie bite it's a good place to try out.

This is in walking distance from work which is awesome. It's a great place to grab a fresh sandwhich, salad or wrap and they'll change things up on the menu of asked. Honestly I'd come here just for the service, everyone that works here is super friendly and I love going in there to say hi and talk to them. So far my fave is the #99, but on sourdough bread... So yummie!

I decided to check this place out due to moving to the area and the reviews on Yelp and Im so happy I did. I've tried 4 different salons in the last couple of years and haven't found a place I've wanted to go back to until now. I called in and they said Id be seeing Brittany and Im sure every stylist there does a great job, but I'm glad I randomly got booked with her. She did exactly what I wanted... FINALLY I got the color I've been wanting when the last 3 people couldn't get it right. She talked to me to make sure we were on the same page with what I wanted, which I really appreciated because I feel some stylist don't fully listen or make their clients completely comfortable. On top of her doing an awesome job on my hair she is a pretty awesome chick and easy to talk to. When your in a chair for a few hours that makes a huge difference.   I am more than excited to say I've finally found someone I'll be going back to!!! If you want someone great with color then she's your go to girl! Love my hair

Well I've been craving breakfast for the last few days and decided on my way from school I'd have a cheat day. Found BLD on Yelp and thought I'd give it a try. I had the tostada and I got the breakfast burrito for my bf to go. Both were very very filling and delicious. I probably are too much to be honest, but I couldn't stop haha. The girl who took my order at the window was very friendly and for getting it to go it wasn't a long wait at all. I also got the BLD iced coffee which was yummie and refreshing. I definitely want to go back and try other things on their menu. Maybe my next cheat day I'll head out there haha.

Love the orange and coconut mixed, so yummie!!!! It's a little pricey being that it's more than a gallon of ice cream, but I feel most self serve yogurt places are like that. I like that it's open until 10 pm because some close earlier than that and it's not too far from me.

They have a full service car wash and a quick drive thru one as well. I just wanted to use the quick drive thru one and the guy working there was quick to help me out with the specials and different services. One reason I like the quick wash here you still have someone dry off your windows so they don't get all spotty which is great and they still give you an air fresh we. Great service!

I went through the same thing Donna did and it was very frustrating. Dr. Kerr was friendly, but I felt she took no time at all to hear me out or address my concerns. I had to go back a 2nd time because the first time I mentioned some dry patches to them that they said just to put lotion on, well of course I was already doing that. So after they looked that over we talked about why else I was there. So the second time around I had to go back for my skin because it was getting worse and of course I waited there and waited to be seen my students which I did not prefer. Finally Dr. Kerr came in and barely listened to me and rushed me out. This has been about 5 months ago now, but I felt I had to write this review. She misdiagnosed me and my skin hasn't gotten any better. I am frustrated that I even had to pay for this pointless visit and will never go back.

First time here and I ordered the seasonal green salad with steak. The girl who took my order was really friendly which good customer service is a huge deal to me. On top of that my salad was fresh and delicious and the perfect size. It's so nice to be able to get a yummie salad to go! I just wish this place was closer to me.

Ok so I would rate this place a 4 out of 5 is I solely based it on the donuts. They are pretty good and the lady that works there is very friendly and gave me 2 extra donuts free, which I def did not need lol, but it was very nice of her. Not too many businesses provided good customer service these days. Anyway the only downfall is the boba which saddens me because I was extremely excited when I saw a boba place going near me. I'm from the Bay Area and you can seriously find boba on every corner! So I have tried their milk tea and I won't have it again, I tried something else one time and didn't finish it and today I got a Thai tea which is ok. I crave boba all the time so this is frustrating because the next nearest place is kind of far but it is good. So kuddos for the donuts, but not so much for the milk tea.

Just went in to get powdered peanut butter and the lady there who I think is the store owner was super friendly and I could hear her helping out some other ladies and she seemed pretty knowledgable. When I checked out she also gave me a couple of free vanilla protein shakes to try!

Normally I would give this place maybe 3/4 stars, but today we went to buy food to make breakfast and everything is fine until we got home. We cooked out food and my boyfriend took a bite if our breakfast sandwiches and thought the Jimmy Dean sausage tasted weird, well it's been expired for 6 days!!! There should be no reason that a store sales anything past expiration especially meat products!!! This is the job of Walmart and their employees to check these things. Guess we'll have to keep an eye out if we even continue shopping here and we will be going back to talk to a manager.

So we went back that day to talk to someone about our issue and we were offered more expired meat. I couldn't believe it and at this point even if it wasn't expired our appetite for sausage was completely out the window. When we told the girl we didn't want to exchange it she called her assistant manager who was completely rude from the start. She walked up and the girl who we spoke with explained the situation and then just stared at us and said nothing. At that point my bf explained the situation again and I added in that the meat should be removed which seamed to only agitate her even more.  She did not apologize once and was never friendly what so ever which only upset us more, especially since we were being calm about the situation. Plus my bf was not feeling well from the meat. At this point we were offered $3 for a refund and my bf again explained that we had to throw out the eggs we cooked in the grease and had to throw the cheese and bread we used. Again, this only made her attitude worse.  This was really not how we planned spending our Saturday morning.  From that point she just gave us a rude look, silence.... Then said "Well you can just have a $10 gift card" it was her tone and horrible customer service that upset us so we took the $3 dollars and walked out.  Bad customer service is my pet peeve so to say the least we will no longer be giving Walmart out service!

First time here and I'm super excited that a juice place has finally opened up in my area!  I walked in and the place is a cute small little spot, but very clean and I like the look plus they have a couple of outside tables. I was greeted right when I walked in and the girl at the register was very friendly and helpful... Customer service goes a long way with me  So I decided to go with a smoothie, but they also have juices and acai bowls which look delicious.  I ordered the date nut which reminds me of yummie banana nut bread, which I love!   Just a heads up for anyone looking to grab the cleanses or bottled juices, they said they wouldn't be getting those for another week or two.  I'll definitely be going back...

This was once Lollicup, it's still the exact same inside and still the best boba spot. Their Thai tea and milk tea are delicious.
