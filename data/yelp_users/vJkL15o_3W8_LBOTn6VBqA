Creative food, fantastic drinks, breezy patio, excellent location, spot-on service (even created something off menu for us). Perfect Saturday morning brunch destination, need I say more?

What I love about El Encanto.  1. The ambiance. I have been coming here for years and I read some of the other reviewers comments about dining on the patio and flies or poor service. I have had both here. So I can see that you could have the misfortune of happening here when either of those are occurring, but do not let it deter you from trying again or trying for the first time. I have been to this restaurant more than 50 times and on the whole the service is above average with some experiences being excellent, and any flying nuisances have occurred maybe twice. In Phoenix, there ARE certain times of year that flies run rampant and are virtually unavoidable outside and are not at all a sign of a lack of cleanliness on the restaurants part. There is NO other place to sit than outside on the patio, inside feels dismal and like you are in a subpar mexican restaurant. My children go nuts for the duck pond and I happily dig in my purse for supplies of quarters as it buys me minutes of serenity to sip on my marvelous margarita. This alone is why I visit again and again. So let's talk about the margaritas.  2. The food. I have had dishes I love and dishes I hate and dishes that were just, well, meh. I agree that this is not "authentic" mexican food, but the pollo fundidos make up for that in taste. I ADORE their margies and I like theirs frozen. They are tart and strong and by the time I have had one and are a sip in to the second, the tranquility washes over me. The feeling like I have been exported to an exotic country (save the room full of sun visor wearing cave creek golfers in my immediate view) with my children gleefully dumping hand fulls of feed at the ducks just within my view and I know longer care ALL that much about the food that just got served. I much prefer the food at their sister restaurant along the carefree highway, El Encanto Dos. So here I typically stick to fajitas or fish to avoid the caloric heavyweight of the pollo fundido. I know fajitas are a cop out, but let's remember, I'm here for the margaritas and the duck pond.

We've been using Horizon Carpet for close to 10 years on recommendation from another carpet cleaning company in central Phoenix. They are always available to with a fairly short notice, Bob is fantastic and every technician has been capable and polite. Our carpets come up beautifully every time, we've also used them to steam clean tile floors and grout and were thrilled with the results. They are an absolutely professional outfit, top notch for customer service and as Realtors they always come highly recommended to our clients as well. While they aren't the cheapest out there, you get what you pay for, and we've never been nickle and dimed and always felt the quality of their clean was well worth the extra buck.  Highly recommended!

TERRIBLE!!!! Even the worst car wash at Danny's is better than this place. Read the print carefully, they charge the same as a regular wash anywhere else but ONLY do dash, doors and console no matter what level of wash you pay for. That means anything anywhere else is left dirty. The only thing decent is the lobby. Their vacuum jobs are also subpar. I've even paid for detailing and it was no better than a full wash elsewhere. So why am I paying $20?????????????????   And why did I return? Never. Again. Save yourself the aggravation.

On the charcuterie menu happy little pots of mustard or chutney accompany salami and an assortment of other delicious cheeses. The evoo and balsamic dip with their fresh baked crusty bread were carbohydrate heaven. The atmosphere was bustling and hip, not ideal for a romantic evening but perfect for a delicious bite prior to a downtown event. Will definitely dine here again!

Just Called their office number and the voicemail says that they are no longer accepting new work or new customers. :(

Emery Hearing Centers came highly recommended to us by a friend, and they did not disappoint. We insisted that my dad visiting from CA be seen to see if there was a better technology than the Costco hearing aid he'd been fitted for several years back. Even with his old hearing aid in, it was difficult to carry on a conversation with him because he was struggling to hear and understand you. He's 63 year, still working full time and with young grandkids and a busy gold schedule, and having to yell to be understood by him was frustrating to the whole family.   First, I scheduled an appointment for him a couple of days after Christmas and we got right in, which I was very impressed with. But what impressed me most was that when he finally got his NEW hearing aids in, he could actually hold a conversation and normal conversational volume WITHOUT reading lips. I wanted to jump for joy!

Awesome! Great good, great vibe. Had the Shepard's Pie Pasty and British hubby had Bangers and mash! Crust was buttery and flaky. Banoffee Pie was out of this world! Atmosphere had hints of a traditional pub contrasted with a contemporary hipster vibe. Great cocktails and draft beer. Calorific heaven.
