Paradise Juice is a lunchtime jewel sequestered away from the street in a strip mall full of giant  chain stores. Ok, that was a bit dramatic, but we who have spent enough time in Phoenix know that strip malls often house great food finds and we must educate outsiders not to discriminate based on appearances. Paradise Juice is really good...seriously. And it's healthy!  This little spot is owned and operated by an Iranian family that is just so genuinely nice you'll feel good giving them your business. All of their smoothies are amazing and made with fresh ingredients. Try the cranberry-based ones for something less sweet or opt for a delicious vegetable juice. If you need food on top of your liquid meal, I especially love the grilled vegetable sandwich. There are a few nice outdoor tables, albeit, your view is a massive parking lot.

I've heard a lot of great things about this place and I was excited to finally have the chance to check it for brunch this weekend. If I had to base my rating solely on the menu and the food, I would probably give Orange Table four stars. The menu was creative and I would have been happy ordering just about anything on it.    BUT....the service was absolutely horrible. We had a large party (family in town) and called ahead to put our names on the list. They seated us almost immediately when we arrived. Two (elderly) members of our party had trouble finding the place and the waiter was VERY upset that they weren't there on time. He was incredibly rude and took his sweet time with everything. We received our food after about 50 minutes, long after all of the tables around us (that had ordered after us) had finished eating. Our waiter was not the only rude one, either. There was just a general attitude problem.  I am a big fan of any place with a good beer selection, but it doesn't look like I'll be going back to the Orange Table any time soon, which is a bummer.

Lalibela has the best Ethopian food around. The flavors are all amazing and everything --veggies and meat alike-- is stewed to perfection. I would recommend the "Lalibela Exclusive" or one of the other samplers. If you don't eat red meat, just ask them to substitute those portions with their favorite alternative. Try on the Ethopian teas or the delicious stout with your meal. The staff is also incredibly friendly and of course, everyone loves to eat with their hands, right?

Spinato's is a sweet, garlicy, gem hidden in an industrial park near Tempe Marketplace and apparently it's been surviving back there for a couple of decades. I am convinced that this is the best pizza in Tempe, perhaps the whole valley. Their pizzas are thin-crust and sliced in a grid, which means you end up eating about 10 little slices! Their homemade sauce is amazing and sweet and their toppings are fresh and come in an endless variety. Try the Grandma's if you like garlic and their spinach is always pretty tasty when paired with red peppers. The ambiance (if you can call it that) is pretty hilarious...very Long Island...think plastic flowers. If the main rooms fill up, they'll seat you in what definitely used to be a warehouse, still decked out with charming cinderblocks and all. It's also BYOB (my favorite!). They do have weird hours though. I think they close at 8 or 9pm, so give them a call first and get good directions.

I'll start by saying that I love Casey's and I definitely frequent there more than any other bar in town. But the service is absolutely the worst around (outside at least, and I would not recommend going inside). Expect to wait 15 minutes to get a waitress to notice your table and then expect another 15 between ordering and actually getting your drink. Oh, and don't be surprised it your waitress confuses Smithwicks with Fat Tire.  That said, the drink prices are good (especially during happy hour), the location is awesome, and nothing beats sitting outside at Casey's on a nice afternoon/night.  I would not recommend eating anything that isn't fried (how is this place an oyster house?!), though it does have good food for drunk people.

This place has great ambiance, set it an old house with seating in multiple rooms and a lovely outdoor space. The decor is eclectic.  They have a nice wine and beer selection and the antipasto speciale was delicious! The bruschetta looked amazing and I'm sorry we didn't give that a try.  The pizzas were definitely tasty and reasonably priced for dinner. They have a changing special pizza and wine pairing...a nice way to try new things.  We will definitely be back!

I am so glad to have rediscovered Sahara at its new location! I've been on a quest to discover the best hummus in Phoenix and when this place closed at its old location, I was sure that the best stuff was gone forever! But it's back, still run by it's original Iraqi owner, and just as delicious as before. The tahini-rich hummus and babganoush are the best around and the grape leaves are stuffed with saffron rice and lots of herbs and spices. My favorite thing to do it order a couple of lemonades, the vegetarian platter, and one of the pits sandwiches (the kuku is pretty tasty) and share it all with a friend. The baklava isn't bad either. Oh, and it's cheap!

I haven't tried any of the restaurants in Mekong Plaza (with the exception of some yummy bubble tea at the Taiwanese place), but the market is great! At least for now, it is way cleaner than the Asian market at the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix. It's got a larger selection of meat and a range of whole fish, which can be really hard to find around here. Their produce is fresher than other Asian markets in the valley and the price is right. I only wish they had a hot counter for snacking!

I haven't been here since it was Fate (which I liked) and I have to say that I like Nine 05 ever better. The menu is original (ex. foie gras and Beijing duck dumplings, tomato katsu, pork belly crepes) and pretty much everything that comes out of the kitchen is amazing. The pork belly fried rice with carmelized onion, the char siu pork and all of the noodles are outstanding. The tofu steak is a damn tasty vegetarian option. Nine 05 also has a great selection of Asian beers (though sadly the martinis Fate was famous for are no longer on the menu). The service is friendly and attentive. Go there!

I must admit that I was skeptical when I heard that Tops Liquor Store (which seems to always have a homeless man getting arrested outside its front door) had opened up a bar next door. I envisioned a room with long, flickering, florescent lights, plastic-tiled floors and tables and chairs fashioned out of stacked up 30 rack boxes.   What an awesome surprise! Not only is Taste of Tops surprisingly nice inside, but the beer selection is incredible. They have beer on tap that's hard to find even in bottles and their fridge selection warrants excessive drooling (and drinking).   Hooray for finally having a bar nearby where the beer actually tastes good (eh hem...Casey's).

I finally made it over to Soi 4 and as soon as I stepped foot inside I began kicking myself for not trying it sooner. The decor is chic and minimalist with clean lines, industrial materials and orb-like rattan lanterns overhead. Above the main dining room is also a hanging balcony of sorts, which gives the space a nice three dimensional quality.   The food itself is outstanding. It's some of the best Thai I've had outside of Thailand. The flavors are deep and authentic but the dishes, rather than being traditional, push beyond the standard pad thai and curries. They are very sophisticated and elegant versions of the classics, but still stay true to the original concepts.   I recommend starting with the kanom pak gard-- a warm, sauteed turnip cake served with egg, bean sprouts, chives a spicy-sweet dipping sauce. The poh taak seafood soup is also good for a starter to share. The broth is complex and refreshingly spicy and the seafood is fresh and flavorful. Follow that with the som tom (papaya salad) paired with sticky rice.  For mains, you really can't go wrong, but I love the pad ke-mow and kang kua mu ("coconut braised pork shoulder, kabocha squash, and Thai basil in tangy red curry"). Definitely save room for desert. The menu doesn't list mango sticky rice, but they will have it if the mango is in season. It's outstanding. Get the fried bananas with coconut ice cream, too, if it's available.
