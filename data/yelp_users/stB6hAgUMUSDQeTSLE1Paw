A converted apartment compound, there is more parking lot here than resort. Our TV was 20 years old, the furniture was uncomfortable, and the decor showed less effort than a hospital room. The chorine hot tub burned your skin, and the only bench in the weight room barely held together when I was using the limited and medievally racked free weights. The unit wasn't insulated and the roaring heater barely worked, so we froze and had to shout.   Oh, and they made you pay for internet - daily. Totally insulting.   The only redeeming feature of this resort were the sheets, but again, the bed in our room was only a double.   Apparently Links likes to cut corners. It's the worst timeshare I've ever stayed in. I'll think twice before booking Links again.

Lots of seating, good atmosphere, good coffee, unobtrusive music, and free internet for customers. Exactly as a coffeeshop should be.

A really fun experience with really good, forward-thinking food and menu. It didn't quite deliver on value, but I would definitely return to make sure.

Ate here twice while on vacation. It's been a really long time since I gave a 5-star rating. I can't say enough good things, but I will say this - excellent food, staff, value. Very well thought out, and unique too! I'm very pleased to have found this place.
