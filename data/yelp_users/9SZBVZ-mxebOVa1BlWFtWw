Short and Sweet.    Love Love LOVE this hospital.  I've had surgery there and now my brother is getting care at Good Sam (been in 1 week so far).  The nurses on his floor are for the most part, awesome.    Pros - Valet Parking, Cafeteria on LL2 open 24/7 (grill and yogurt section closes at 7:30ish though), and all the staff at Good Sam.   Cons - Regular Parking.

Mmm... Buñuelos.  Cinnamon sugar covered fried tortilla tastiness!!  I had my first in Rocky Point (bought them from a beach vendor) in 2003.  When I want what is perhaps the freshest vegetables in the city possible or am craving some Buñuelo - I head to PRM!    Their meat department is CRAZY NUTS!  Need pigs feet or a whole cow head.  Here's your place.  Depending on the day, this place can be a madhouse.  Their produce department - Always fresh...and cheap!  Where else can you get green onions for $1.00 for 3 large bunches.   Pastries?  Uhhh, did I mention the Buñuelos?  Cakes and other treats are always being made and decorated when I walk in.    Fresh tortillas always being made at the Tortilleria.  There they are standing in a row.  Big ones.  Small ones.  Some as big as your head.  Deedly Dee! ;)  If ever I'm feeling lazy and not wanting to make my own salsa - I'm going to hit up the salsa bar here.  I've tried the salsas with food from the food court and it's always tasty.  And speaking of the  food court - I've eaten here quite a number of times.  Very tasty no mater what you get.  And I've almost gotten it all.  Last visit, I purchased some pulled pork to make my Cubano Rollups.    PRM - You're awesome!

I can remember riding along with my grandma to go order a pie from Red Devil's takeout window.  Seeing the guys hand-toss the pizza dough in the air was always mesmerizing to me as a kid.    Their pizza crust has not changed, though I'm not sure they still hand-toss the dough anymore.  But its still nice and crispy with the prefect amount of chew.  The price is about par with Streets, etc.    Only thing that sucks about Red Devil - The Parking Lot.

I've gone to Honey Bears now twice. First time was when I was a teenager with my grandparents. Was not impressed. Since it had been st least 15 years, I figured is give out another go. Honestly, I've made better bbq at home. For the price they charge you, of rather go to Famous Daves.   Pork was dry. Ribs were fatty. Cobbler was gluey and tasted like it was Comstock pie filling.   Thank goodness we ate using a Deal Chicken offer.

J's company just had a private preview of zoolights/their holiday party a few weeks ago.    The Phoenix Zoo - I can remember going as a kid on field trips or with my grandparents.  We (my family) loved the zoo so much that not only did my grandparents donate for an exhibit (which I think has been remodeled/turned into another exhibit) , but they'd purchase a club membership so we could go anytime we wanted.    It's been years since I had last been to the Zoo, other than going to Zoolights (which last time i had been to zoolights was in 2008), and A LOT has changed.  A few that I was able to spot on our zoolights/holiday party - moving the admission windows to across the lake and having the main exit go through the gift shop, to the orangutan exhibit indoor inclosure.   Caleb loved seeing the animals we were able to see in the 45 minutes the zoo was still open to the public. I cant wait to take him back!  I'm sure a zoo membership is in our future. :)

Though the name of the store has changed over the years, this brick and mortar has been around since I was a kid.  My grandparents have always referred to it as the "ghetto market".  LOL  What can I say, some may feel that the neighborhood is a "ghetto".  But cest la vie, it's the neighborhood I grew up in and went to grade school right around the corner.  You want a huge store with shiny new lights and fixtures, there's Fry's right down the street.     Anyhow, you simply can NOT beat their produce prices.  In fact, if I simply need veg for a dinner, I'll drive here than go to Fry's because Food City produce beat Frys. Example -  Food City Bananas - 3lbs for 99cents.   Fry's Bananas - 1lb for 57 cents. Buying Food City Bananas - 42% savings   Pretty sweet!  :)

Costco - Oh how I love and loathe you at the same darn time.  "It's not a habit, it's cool...I feel alive.  I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)."   Samples.  Weekends.  Nuf said on that.   I could seriously go in with only needing a few items, YET, somehow manage to rack up a $$$ bill.    Costco, why must you sell such wonderful things like Famous Dave's pickle chips and Fiber 1 bars...which then morphs a monster  - ColdStone coupons, candy, tostitos black bean chips, shredded cheese, chickens, steaks (NY and sirloin), Kirkland ibuprofen, a new coffee maker.....Stoppppppppppppppp The Insanity!!  One gripe - I wish they took credit cards, other than Amex.  While I don't mind paying with my check card, I'd rather earn $1-1pt rewards using my credit card than $3-1pt rewards.

Those are are my friends and use yelp mobile know, J and I LOVE us some Blimpie!  Mike and Kathy, the owners, really go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.  Never does a visit pass where I walk through the door and I hear Mike say, "HEY JILL!!!!"  Or have Kathy ask how Little C is doing.  :)    Fresh product.  Like seriously fresh.  J and I always get the Blimpie Best, the Blimpie Way, with hot and sweet peppers added.  Seriously, so good!!  We get Little C a meatball sandwich, hold the bread.  He gobbles the meatballs down.  C is all about flavor, nothing bland for that kid.  So you know they have to be good meatballs!  :)  I'll never step foot into another Subway again.  If you have yet to try Blimpie's yet, what are you waiting for!?!?

We visited this Applebee's location last night.  We were out running errands, it was getting late, and this location is right around the corner from the house.    The food is average for a chain.  You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.  The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!  Our waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.      J's order - Fajitas.  My order - Oriental Chicken Salad Baby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)  Our server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.    REALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.    J's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.    Drinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!    Then we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.  In fact they seemed pretty pissed.    I sure hope we get a different server if and when we ever return.

Not sure why all the low ratings for this Goodwill!  For a 50% off day this past Saturday, this Goodwill was CLEAN  and the employees were really helpful (getting a cart for me to put a sleeping Baby C's car seat in).     I usually go to the Goodwill in Tempe off Scottsdale Rd and the 202, but it is like a madhouse - top things are it being messy (especially on 50% off days) and being solicited by people in the parking lot.    I'll come to this location instead.

This is the other Ace Hardware store I shop at. As I stated in another Ace store review, I was in the middle of rearranging/decorating our guest bedroom for J's nephew's visit tomorrow (Thursday). I needed to get things in order, or else he's be sleeping on either the floor or the couch.   This past Sunday, I started the task of getting the room in order. We have the digital phone modem and a 27in TV (The TV, which had gone unused and unplugged for over a year) in that room. I proceed to move the dresser to another wall and quickly realized that I'd need a Coaxial Cable Splitter.   I called up Howard's Ace to see if they had the parts I needed. No point in making the trip if only to find out they're sold out! They inform me they have what I need, so I head out.   I get there and remember I also need a few other things (electrical tape, a curtain rod, and grounded plug adapter). I arrive and the greeter asks if I need help. I tell him what I need and he escorts me around the store. I'm in and out within 10 minutes with all my items.   I usually shop at this Ace on the weekends, if I an not near the other Ace in Scottsdale. From my Toro weed eater, a drain catch, to my prior Ace purchase - a professional drain snake (Thanks to my hair, I clog the bathtub drain quite a bit. And I'm not about to pay a plumber for a job I can do myself. And I'm not about to shave my head anytime soon), this Ace IS the place!! :)

Stopped into Franks for lunch Saturday after I had dropped off some items for consignment next door.  Couldnt decide what to get, either the 2 slice special or the gyro combo.  So I asked the guy at the register taking my order to choose for me.    What I got was a gyro with fries combo.  The fries were nice and crispy.  And well the gyro was not terrible, but I could tell the meat was probably something you could purchase from a store and then reheat.  It was not from sliced fresh from a gyro loaf like I've gotten from other places.  The slices were too uniform.  Don't get me wrong, it was not all that bad though.  However, to the guy that makes the food....go a little lighter handed with the tzatziki sauce.     Next time I'm at the store next door around lunchtime, I'll give the Frank's Pizza a go.

4 stars for the eye exam.  Dr Francois was very through.  And $49 for an eye exam (including dilation) isn't too shabby.  I did take my prescription to another store to get my glasses made.  Wasn't going to pay $100 out the door for a pair of glasses that were meant to be backups.  But I did like the fact that they had a lab right there.  So if i wanted, i could have had my new spare pair that day.    I'll be back, definitely...when I need another eye exam.

J and I are fans of the Fish Tacos here.  And we usually only go on Tuesday when they're $1.50 a piece. Dinner for the 2 of us for under $9.00, not too shabby!!!    J is a fan of the hot carrots they have at the salsa bar. It usually never fails when I go, I'm scavenging for the last few slices from the two containers. So I casually mentioned, "You know, you guys should have a separate container just for carrots!" The lady informed me that they do not make their hot carrots (I was under the impression they did), but that they come from a can that has both the chilis and carrots. She then said, "Let me go open a new can and get you some." Sweet!!! Well, more like HOT!! :)   Arcadia Rubio's, you're a-okay in my book!  Especially on Taco Tuesdays! :)

I cant believe I have not Yelp'd about one of my favorite places - Elie's Deli!   Time to remedy that!  We've been going to Elie's for at least 3 years now.  Upon our second visit (we always get our stuff to-go).  I punched vent holes in the lids of the takeout boxes.  Did this to keep the fries from getting steamed to death before being able to eat them at home.    Ever since the hole punch, the owners always remember us!  So much so that, they punch holes in the box for J's fries that he orders with his burger.    Honestly, one of the best gryos I've ever had.  Not oily and not drenched in tzatziki.  And the dressing for the greek salad is super good!    Friendly service, good food!

Super pricey for a large format print job that was done at half the cost at another print shop around the corner.  Oh and apparently what takes another print shop less than 15 minutes to do, takes FedEx/Kinkos more than a day to do.    Shipping is expensive too.

I have an addiction. Its going to the dentist office for routine cleaning. Nothing like Bill Murray's obsessed character, Arthur Denton, in Little Shop of Horrors though. LOL   Dr. Zacher has been my dentist since I was, goodness, 15 years old. I'm 31 now, so yeah, its been a long long time! With Denise being my hygienist since I was 15 as well.   Went yesterday for my regular 6 month cleaning. As usual, everything went fantastic and I was in and out of the chair in less than an hour. My parting gift of course was a new manual toothbrush (which i take even though I have a Sonicare), floss, and toothpaste. YAY!!!!   Had a few issues (cavities for the first time in a LONG time) back in March. I was NOT happy with that at all! But Dr. Zacher got me taken care of quickly and I am pleased with his work.   I always look forward to going to the dentist!    Say Aah! Aaaaaah! Now Spit!

A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! Had a dentist appointment and wanted to grab something to eat back at my desk at work.  Just went through the drive-thru and ordered my usual.  Turkey Bacon Club...everything cold EXCEPT the meat and cheese...on jalapeno bread.    They totally f-ed up my order.  I got bread, meat, and cheese.  No lettuce, tomato, or mayo.  Dry sandwich.   What part of I want everything cold...except the meat and cheese did they not flipping understand?!  Oh and apparently when you say you want jalapeno bread...that in their mind means sourdough.  Nothing like eating a dry sandwich.   Never going back to this location (though its right around the corner from my house).    Should have stopped by the one across the street from work.

Baby C's 1st birthday party was this past Saturday.  I had a birthday stats chalkboard made up Thursday night and needed it printed out ASAP.  Went to the K/FX around the corner and when the guy told me he was pretty backed up and it would be better if he could have it done by Saturday morning.  AND...the price was about $25, not including tax.  I told him I'd think about it.    Remembering there was an OfficeMax nearby, I decided to try my luck there.  I AM SOOO GLAD I WENT THERE!  Not only was the price for a 16x20 large format print less than $20 (was going to be like $15-$16..not including tax), BUT they had it printed out in less than 15 minutes of my arriving there.  I decided to have it mounted on foam board and laminated, which was going to up the cost by about $15, give or take.  STILL CHEAPER THAN K/FX!      I will return if I am ever in need of more print jobs done.  :)

When we don't feel like driving to Fiesta Burrito, our next best place for "OS" food is Los Armandos.   Descent food, descent prices.   Our favorites - Adobada burrito or Adobada plate (plate comes with beans, rice, and a tortilla)  Don't forget the green sauce!

When I am in need of a pedicure, and am feeling cheap, I head on over to Andy's Nails.  Home of the $17.99 spa pedicure!  Callous treatments are an extra $5, but that's the standard price anywhere you go.  I've been going to Andy's now for about a year or so.    Went yesterday afternoon to get a pedi after my dental appointment.  Figured, I just had the teeth clean, now might as well have the feet done now too.  Not that I don't wash my feet when I shower, but you know what I mean.  Now, my issue with Andy's nails is no matter who I sit with, they do not cut my toenails short enough.  Within a matter of a week or two, my toenails are so long I could slice up my bedsheets.    Other than that, everyone is friendly and there are usually enough techs there that you do not have to wait long for a spot to open up.

I hate giving a bad review.  But I am PISSED and feel that I must due to the situation I'm going through presently.  I've been going to Andy's for off and on now for about 2 years (When I need a pedi last moment) and have not had any problems.  Then again, I really don't recall getting nicked or having a tech go overkill with the nippers.    Flash back to last Thursday.  I want to get a quick pedi before J and I headed to Vegas for the Labor Day weekend.  So, I head over to Andy's.  Everything is going well, until the tech starts trimming the cuticles and going after what she must think is a hangnail or something.  Next thing I know, a piece of skin is being what felt like ripped from the side of my toenail bed.  I'm not bleeding, so I think nothing of it.    The rest of Thursday - toe is feeling so-so.   Friday - toe starts feeling a little sore.   Saturday - more soreness.   Sunday, my toe is starting to full on hurt.  Got some redness going on.  Me not having any issues like this in the past, I don't think too much of it.  All week long, my flippin toe continues to hurt.  Even when I'm not walking.  So I decide that I need to do something.  This morning, I mention it to a coworker of mine who's dealt with nail fungus before from getting shoddy services at other establishments.  With my leg hiked up on my desk we take a closer look.  She then says to me, "That looks a little green."   ME - WHAT THE F_CK!??!   Sure enough, right along the cuticle there's a small green patch.  She says that she's seen nailbeds turn green, but not the skin.  I'm pissed.    I was tempted to return to Andy's to ask them, "WTF is this sh*t". But knowing that I had a regular nail appointment (for my gel nails, that i get at a regular salon up in N. Scottsdale), I decide to ask my nail gal about it.    So I head on up to my appointment after work.  No sooner than I get back to my gel gals station, I tell her what's going on and ask her to have a look.  She gets down on her knees, looks at my toe, and immediately grabs some tool from her sanitizer container (the blue stuff).  A few presses of the tool and the next thing I know, puss is coming out from the side of my toe.  OMFingG.  YUCK!!  GAG!!  My gal was super upset.  Upset at the fact that there are techs out there that are lazy and do not properly sanitize their tools and equipment.   Which makes a bad name for everyone else who does do things by the book and follows State Board guidelines.  So now, I have to go and get my toe puss drained every day for the next week or so.  Toe Puss = FAIL  If I was a diabetic, I'd probably be having my toe amputated right about now.  Will I return to Andy's?  HELL TO THE F_CK NO!    And while its on my mind, let me make a call to the state board.  (after thoughts)  When I think about it, a lot of these chop shops do not properly disinfect their pedi bowls.  They're supposed to clean and disinfect the bowl and let circulate for 10 minutes.  I've seen this place, and other chop shops rinse with water, then wipe down with a kitchen type scrub sponge (sometimes spraying with a 409 type product), and then refill with water for the next customer.    From the EPA website on Disinfection for Foot Spa Basins -  http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/footspa_disinfection.htm After Each Client: (this can take place any time after the client's feet are out of the footbath, while feet are massaged, toes are painted, or other opportunities)  1.Drain the water from the foot spa basin or bowl and remove any visible debris.  2.Clean the surfaces of the foot spa with soap or detergent, rinse with clean water, and drain.  3.After cleaning, disinfect* the surfaces with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant (for description) according to the manufacturer's directions on the label. Surfaces must remain wet with the disinfectant for 10 minutes or the time stated on the label, which may be shorter.  * For whirlpool foot spas, air-jet basins, "pipe-less" foot spas, and other circulating spas: It is best to disinfect by filling the basin with clean water, adding the appropriate amount of liquid disinfectant, and turning the unit on to circulate the disinfectant for the entire contact time.  4.After disinfection, drain and rinse with clean water.   Next time you get your mani-pedi (at any nail place), start to take notice of how they're disinfecting/cleaning.

I decided to go and get my truck washed on Saturday at Simoniz.  First  professional carwash it has had in about 2 years.  For $5 you get a basic wash and towel dry. No vacuuming done. Most of the other Wash-n-Go places let you vacuume your vehicle, but I'd rather have my vehicle towel dried.   I pull in and the assistant manager says their having a special $29.99 detail (which includes their $19.99 deluxe wash). We talk for a few minutes and I state I don't want the armerol or air freshener or any of that stuff done to the inside of the truck. I just wanted the seat vacuumed. He said he will do the deluxe wash and shampoo the seats (which requires a wet vac that sucks out 90% of the water.) for $29.99. I ask how long all of this will take and am told 25-30minutes, tops. SOLD! My truck is 15 years old and has 15 years work of grime in the cloth seats.   I walk inside and watch them pull my truck up to the ramp thing. Then watch it go through the wash, making sure all the special lights go one for the different treatments. I proceed to head on down the the cashier and pay. $29.99 on the card. Apparently, I got a pretty good deal because the cashier said, "WOW!"   I know how to deal...whatever.  I make my way outside, pull up a chair to the table out there, and watch my truck pulled around to the detail area. I wanted to keep an eye on things. I was pretty much staring at my truck the whole time. My truck proceeds to sit for about 15 minutes before anyone begins on the detail.   45 minutes later, my truck is "done".   I first inspect the outside of the truck. I notice there is still some soot on the tailgate from when we went camping last. I ask him to clean it off. He wipes his finger over it as if it was damage. Then notices that its not, and wipes it off with a cleaner.   I open up the passenger side door and have a look in. I notice that the seats still look a little dingy and the area between the driver and passenger side wasn't even touched. I point this out to the guy who was doing the detail work. He says sorry for missing it and proceeds to use some cleaning (degreaser) solution and rub it out. I immediately say, "I was told that the seats would be shampooed and then a majority of the water vacuumed out. Was that not done?" And he couldn't lie stating he used the wet vac, because I never saw anything of that type rolled over to the truck. The guy tells me that that process would take a lot longer.   UM HELLO...I FLIPPIN WANT WHAT I PAID FOR!!! I don't give a sh*t if you have to take the time to do the job correctly. I refrained from saying that though.   The detail guy goes and gets the assistant manager and brings him back and the asst. manager asks if everything is okay. HELL NO. Things are not okay! After explaining what the (Fail to) detail guy did, the asst. mgr apologized and proceeded to get another detail guy on the job.   Just because I was pissed, I decided to talk to the manager too. He said, he'd make sure everything was done over again and correct. LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE FIRST TIME AROUND!   Time at Car Wash now - 1hr   Frankie did an awesome job on detailing my truck. He wanted me to inspect both the outside and inside before leaving. Everything looked fantastic!! I had wished Frankie would have done the detailing the first time around. The manager gives me a free wash but only after I asked for some form of compensation.   Time at Car Wash now - 1hr 40mins   I get into the truck to leave and grab for my key. Hmm... Its not in the ignition. I holler over to Frankie a car away and ask if he'd seen my key. He walks over and says, "Its not in the ignition??" I bit my tongue as a "Here's your sign" comment was nano seconds from leaving my mouth.   My key is officially MIA. I wasn't about to say, oh its just the spare...dont worry about it. HELL NO! I have a habit of locking my keys in my truck, so I need the spare!! Next thing I know, I have 6 guys around my truck looking for my key. This is the WORST possible thing that could have happened after the failed shampoo seats incident. I was LIVID and everyone within ear shot knew it.  Finally my key is located. The person who drove it from the line to the detail area put it in the cupholder. Why would someone remove the key from the ignition!? Why not just leave it there?   The other assistant manager is one of the guys looking for my key. After it is found, he apologizes and gives me a book of washes and a free hand wax. Says that from now on to ask for him personally when I come in and he'll make I'm taken care of when there.   "Warren" is all clean and shiny, but with the hassle that I went through...I don't even know if I want to use the free washes/wax.   Time at Car Wash - 2hrs

Love Love LOVE Baker's Nursery!!  Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago).   Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!    Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and they'll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard.   Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!    Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and they'll replant your plants for you.    Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, they'll tell you how to nurse it back to health.    I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)

Our whole family now goes to Choules Family Dentistry.  As a token of their appreciation, they even sent J a letter thanking him for entrusting them with his family and included a pass to BearArizona.  How awesome is that!?   Great staff.  Great dentist!

The hubby said he wanted PeiWei for his father's day lunch. So PeiWei it was. I order the pad thai and j orders the mongolian steak. J loved his dish.  My pad thai was seriously underseasoned. So I reordered the honey sear chicken, which was awesome!!   On non food note - this place is bathroom baby friendly with a changing station. And as a new mom, that's a necessity in my book.

Sassy Glasses has been my eyeglass retailer since 2004! Having needed glasses since I was a kid, but yet not finding a pair that fits my face (I've got a big noggin), I went without for a very long time because I couldn't stand the way I looked in frames.  Either that or I'd get glasses, and not wear them.  Contacts did not work for me either.    A very good friend of mine is friends with the owners, Dan and Quida, and suggested I check out their shop. I walked in and immediately thought - I think I can find something in here that I like and more importantly, looks awesome on me!   I love my Booth and Bruce glasses and sunglass clips! Dan suggested the clips because I had lost 2 pairs of prescription sunglasses in the past.   I have been wanting new frames for the wedding and know I'll be able to find something I love at Sassy Glasses! The boutique is a little bit on the pricey side, but IMO you get what you pay for!

If you're picky about how you look in your glasses and the run of the mill frames found at the 1hour places do not suit your style - Head on over to Sassy Glasses!   I got my glasses a few weeks before the wedding so I could get used to the new prescription. I wore them EVERYWHERE, except around J. I had a few people ask me what was wrong with my old frames. Or better yet, why I was going to wear glasses on my wedding day. Why not get contact lenses. Seriously?! I know your wedding day is a special day, but why would I wear contacts that one day when I wear glasses on a daily basis.   Dan and Quida understand this and helped me pick out the best frames that suited my face, would look fantastic on my wedding day (almost like another wedding accessory..an extension of my veil, jewelry, etc), and would look fantastic for everyday wear.   I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Alain Mikli glasses and get tons of compliments on them/how I look in them!   The first time my hubby saw my new glasses was when I was walking down the isle. After the ceremony, he laughed and said, "How long have you been hiding those?!" To which I replied, "Oh just a few weeks!"   Thank you Dan and Quida!!!

Was here last night for a Yelp event.    Reason for the missing star - The handicapped stall in the ladies room on the patio - Its door latch/lock is broken.  Couldn't keep the stall door closed.    Being almost 30 weeks pregnant and maneuvering in a regular stall - Not fun.    Other than that - I've always loved this tucked away location!!  :)

E (My MOH and fellow Yelper!) and I went to the Phoenix Bridal Expo back in January and we just happened to stop by the Davids Bridal booth. $50 off coupon just for booking an appointment at the expo. SOLD! Now I had looked at the dresses on line and had a few already "favorited" on the site under my account. So when my dress appointment happened on February 13th, I knew which ones I wanted to look at.   I arrive with my entourage (my mom, grandmother, E, my bridesmaids, and a few friends) and I'm greeted upon entry. I state I have an appointment with Patty (I think that was her name) and shortly after, Patty comes up, greets us, and we head back to the fitting area. I told Patty what I was looking for and not looking for. Much to my mother's disapproval what I wasn't looking for was a Pretty Pretty Princess, 20lbs of tulle, poofy shoulders gown with a cathedral length veil. Sorry Ma! Ain't happening. Patty listened to my concerns and offered lots of feedback.   I tried on my first dress (which I loved online, but wasn't sure how it was going to look when I put it on) and immediately fell in love! I tried on at least 4 other dresses, including a PPP with a floor length veil to appease my mother. Patty saw my frustration and thankfully stepped in when my mom was about ready to pull dresses for me. Patty suggested I try on the first dress again, which I did. I knew it was the one, especially with everyone exclaiming that the dress had me (my personality) written all over it.   OH and the most awesome part, I was able to purchase the sample dress! I wanted a sample as opposed to ordering a new dress. Watching Say Yes to the Dress taught me one thing - How a dress fits and lies on the body might be a little different with a brand new dress, than the sample one. With the sample, its like wearing your favorite pair of jeans, they're broken in. :)   Cleaning and pressing were included in the price. SWEET!! SOLD!   The only slip-up and reason why I cant give them 5 stars is the fact that my special order pieces (the bra and slip) were not included on the order when I purchased the dress and accessories. Something I should have caught before I paid. But none the less a quick call, and everything was fixed. They even held my special order items for about 2 months after they arrived (the next time I'd be in that area for the bridesmaid dress appointment).   All in all, great people/company to work with!

Went here the other Monday before Little C's TLG monday class.  Place was pretty empty, but that was alright.  Mondays kids eat for only $.99 which was a nice surprise.    J ordered the Francheeze, which he enjoyed.  That is until he got about 3/4 of the way through and noticed the bacon was not 100% cooked.  He didnt eat anymore after that.   I ordered the club on sourdough.  Cant really mess up a club.  Bacon was fully cooked.  Turkey was nice and cold.  Lettuce was crisp.  I ended up sharing a section of my club with J.  He said, "MAN, I should have ordered the club!"  We ordered Little C a grilled cheese.  Cant really mess up a grilled cheese.    Service was fast and friendly.  The waitress even offered to fill up our Bobble water container, which was nice of her.    I'm pretty sure we'll be back.

Let me just start off saying that I was an original tenant at Mandarina. I moved into my unit in Feb 2002 (the unit had never been occupied) and moved out April 2009 upon buying a house.   I am very picky when it comes to my living quarters, and Mandarina lived up to my expectations throughout the years. I have to say that while every complex/neighborhood is going to have its fair share of problems (crime, aggravating neighbors, etc), at Mandarina, there was rarely an incident.   Three gripes throughout the years:  Parking Accommodations -  About 95% of the parking is covered. If your guest parks in a covered space, they're liable to get towed if the resident arrives home to find their spot is taken. If there are no spots, your guests must find parking elsewhere. Most likely next door at the Draw-10 and walk over.   Trash Pickup - This was both a perk and a pain. The perk was not having to cart your trash all the way to the trash compactor. You instead just left outside of the breezeway every pickup morning. My gripe is at no fault of Mandarina, but the residents who did not abide by the trash service times.   Light rail - No fault of Mandarina. Waiting to get out of the complex to head east on Washington was always a pain after the light rail was completed.   While I had no issues with the staff upon moving out, the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004.  Overall, I'd recommend Mandarina to anyone looking for a new apartment complex.

This is a long one... I've taken a few days to try to cool off to write this review, because Friday afternoon, I WAS LIVID with Azteca Wedding Plaza. Now you can ask everyone that has encountered me while I've been wedding planning, I've been laid back with everything. Some may say too laid back. But what can I say, why get all uptight and frustrated and turn into a Bridezilla when this is supposed to be a happy joyous occasion? My girls and groom know what happened this past Friday. They all think I had a right to be furious.   Flash back to June 26th. The date for my bridesmaids dress appointment. Everything went beautifully, well except the fact that it was going to take 3+ months to get their dresses in. But none the less, we had a good experience.   They dropped the girls dresses about $40 in price, BUT because of the tight schedule, the owner informed me that paying for rush shipping would be a pointless. But instead to opt for a Rush Cut, which was a $20 charge per dress instead of $60+ for rush shipping per dress. I paid the extra $60 ($20 for 3 dresses), and the owner gave an estimation of mid September of the arrival of the dresses. A little close, but we're still good on time.   Fast forward to this past Friday.....I out of curiosity give Azteca a call to check on the status of the dress. The guy on the phone informed me that the dresses arrived to the store on AUGUST 25th, and that an email had been sent out to my email address. Um, okay. I never received an email from Azteca. I repeated this multiple times over the phone.  I check my email multiple times a day on my phone. I would have seen that! I rush down there HOT and ready for some explanations. If an email had been sent out, but no response..phone call..nada had been received from the bride/bridal party, WHY would a place of business NOT reach out via telephone?!? WHY?!?   I arrive to Azteca and head over to the dress side. I wait for about 15 minutes before I am acknowledged. Granted, there's 2 customers being helped on the dress side, one of them standing next to me, but I did not even a hello/welcome/go f yourself you got the email from the employee or owner. Finally, I am acknowledged by the employee who's been sitting right in front of me. "Have you been helped?" I wanted to say, "I've been standing here IN FRONT OF YOU for 15 f-ing minutes without anyone greeting me. Are you blind? And does my facial expression LOOK like I've been helped?" I in my most calmest voice say, "No, I have not been helped yet." I explain the situation and he happened to be the guy on the phone i had just spoken with. I say, well I need to see the owner. He says the owner is with a customer right now, but he'll be with me shortly. So I wait.   10 more minutes go by and the same guy who I had spoken with asks me if I want to see the dresses. I of course say yes. He goes to the back to go find them. 15 minutes go by and no dresses. A few minutes later, the same guy who was getting the dresses for me walks out and goes off to help another customer. Still no dresses. REALLY?! REALLY!?   The owner finally comes over and we go back and forth. He confirms my email address and stands firm that they sent an email out on the 25th. I stand firm at the fact that I never received an email. He asks me if I checked my junk folder. I proceed to tell him that I've gotten multiple emails from Azteca before and their email address is in my contact list. I ask him if they receive no communication from the bride after said email is sent, do they telephone the customer? He flat out says no and that most brides call them in anticipation of when the dresses will get there. That and 90% of the time, the email communication works. HELLO! I paid for a rush cut, so THEY didn't even truly know when the dresses might have arrived. They only gave me an estimated date of mid September. So maybe I should have rang them every week to see when the dresses would ship! MY BAD! I'm sorry, but solely relying on internet/email communication is not the proper way to do business and communicate with the customer.   I tell him I am extremely upset at the fact that my bridesmaids could have already had their dresses fitted. I ask what he's willing to do to rectify the situation. He says NADA! He is not willing to do anything. But he's very sorry. SORRY!? I wanted to tell him he'd be really be sorry when I hop over this counter and kick the living sh*t out of him! Needless to say, my sensibility kicked in.   I paid off the remaining balance for the dresses and stormed out with them in tote.  I was not about to have my bridesmaids subjected to Azteca for alterations, which they are fine with.   My recommendation, GO TO DAVID'S BRIDAL for ALL your bride/bridesmaids dress needs.  Azteca = ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PS - I found the email in my Trash folder.  But it wasnt from "Azteca Bridal" like all previous emails.  It was from "REPLY".

Mobile Tip - Hope they hire an organized valet company next mother's day.   Review - Now I've been to The Farm before, having eaten at Morning Glory with girlfriends on a saturday morning a while back.  It was a lovely experience (from the environment to the service - having asked for my "any style" eggs to be hard boiled.  They didnt bat an eye at the request.) and I wanted to come back for Mother's Day with my family.     Mother's Day - It's crowded.  I mean like WAY over 1+ hour wait for MG, crowded.  But that's understandable.  It was Mother's Day afterall.  If you want to come here for an event like the Mother's Day Brunch, reservations ARE required.  If you miss out on reservations for brunch, and decide to go to MG, go early!    We decided to skip MG and were going to eat at The Farm Kitchen, but we ended up having to leave because Little C ended up having a major asthma attack.  We had used the valet service for parking, which offering valet on a busy day like Mother's Day is great.  BUT only if the service is organized.  We hustle back to the valet stand and I had over the ticket.  I look at the valet stand and there are key piled up everywhere.  No organization whatsoever.  They're digging for my keys, meanwhile Little C has just puked all over me for a 3rd time.  2 minutes go by and J and I ask them a couple times if they could please hurry and find our keys.  They find our keys and one kid runs off.  Next thing I know, the head guy (I'm guessing he was the guy in charge over valet), turns to us and says in a snarky manner..."I'm SORRY your child is having issues."    Umm...excuse me?!    Thank gawd they found the keys and got our vehicle up in a flash or else I would have had to not only call 911 for Little C's breathing, but for my putting my foot up that guys ass.     I think if we decide to come back, (which I'd like to go back because the atmosphere, service, and food at MG was great) we will self park across the street.

We went to the Mother's Day brunch this year. Scheduled it as the first group of seatings. Service was fantastic and it was not crowded. Food was delicious. Will definitely do MDB here again, booking at the same first seating time.

When we originally went in to the Room Store, we were greeted by one of the sales people.  I do not recall the gals name that approached us when we walked in.  But we told her what we were looking for.  She basically pointed us in the direction we needed and said, if you have any questions..come find me.   Uhh..okay.  We'll come find you.     Well, we had questions after a few minutes and this woman was no where to be found.  After I walked the store for about 10 minutes and still was not finding our sales gal - I ran into Tommy.  *church organ and choir singing*  I had had enough with trying to find our sales gal and we starting dealing with Tommy.  He answered all our questions on the sectional and we then informed him that we were also looking for a king size mattress.    No sooner than we get into the mattress area, the original sales gal approaches all of us and was like...."I've been looking all over for you guys."  I wanted to say, 'Yeah fucking right..cause I walked around 10 minutes looking for you!"  I instead informed her that we were doing business for Tommy.  She walked away with a pissed look on her face.  I would have looked pissed too knowing that I blew a few K's sale cause I was in the back room or where ever doing whatever!    A week later we returned to purchase our sectional and mattress saving $1200 in the process (thanks to price matching on the sectional and a sealy optimum sale going on - king for a queen!)  Outstanding customer service from Tommy.  The delivery guys a few days later were very helpful too, removing our old mattress and offering to move our old couch and loveseat into the carport (it was scheduled to be picked up by a charity the next day).    We'll definitely return when we're in the need of furniture!!

I will make the trek up to Anthem to go to these outlets instead of going to the ones near Westgate.  Why?  Store selection for one.  The only other Stride Rite outlet is at AZ Mills.  And while that store is A LOT closer for us (like a 10 minute drive tops), I'd rather not deal with a crowd or messy store.  All of the stores we've gone into at the OaA are well kept and clean.    That and the drive up there makes it feel like we're taking a mini road trip.

This hospital and all the staff we encountered (mostly in the ICU and CICU) are incredible!  J, not getting off work until 5pm and then us making the trek down to CRMC, we thought the first night we wouldn't make visiting hours.  The ICU's visiting hours end at 6pm.  That was never an issue.    J and I usually arrived around 6pm and no one ever gave us a hard time with getting back and visiting Dad.  We usually stayed until 8pm or so.  So a BIG THANK YOU TO THE ICU staff!!!  Im telling ya, if I happen to be down in that neck of the woods and, God Forbid, I need to go to the hospital - I want to go to Chandler Regional!

I have been renting my Halloween costumes from Mardi Gras for well over 7 years.  Their rental selection is HUGE!  And I can always piece together the outfit I'm doing with no problem.  It is hard to rent from other shops cause I have T&A.  And other rental shops costumes are usually something they've ordered off the internet.   Mardi Gras' costumes are stage quality.  They rent out to a lot of different High School theater troops and well a lot of theater troops in general.   The staff is very helpful.  Coreen is a riot!!  And the October rental policy is killer!!  Your rental is for the entire month.  My 1920's Beach Beauty costume I'm picking up next week - $30 rental FOR THE WHOLE MONTH!!    You definitely get your moneys worth when you rent your Halloween costume from Mardi Gras.  :D

I went and saw Dr. Eckel for the first time back in April.  He and ValleyOB/GYN came highly recommended from quite a few co-workers who have him as their OB/GYN.    There's 2 offices.  The one off Shea and the one off Osborn.  My appointment was at the Shea office.  In a nutshell, his staff is fantastic and he is wonderful!  I had a few things I wanted looked into, since my old OB/GYN office dropped the ball back in 2009.  He addressed my concerns, wrote out the referrals I needed, and in the end...everything turned out A-OK!    I look forward to having Dr. Eckel as my OB, not just my GYN!  :)

So, a year after posting my review for Dr. Eckel...I'm now pregnant.  16 weeks to be exact as of today.    Its been nothing but a wonderful experience!  My husband really likes Dr. Eckel and the entire staff, which means a lot.  Any questions you may have outside of an appointment, they're quick to get back to you.  And Dr. Eckel deliver's about 85% of his patients babies.    To quote my husband, "I believe we got ourselves a 'Dr. Huxtable'!"

J and I stopped at Az Mills on Black Friday to do some shopping.  Me being prego and having my baby bump already showing, my jeans were starting to be on the verge of uncomfortable.  I joked with J that if I didn't do something soon, our baby would come out with an indentation in its little forehead!  I see Motherhood Maternity has a sale going on, so we head on in.    A few minutes after entering the store, the urge to pee hits me.  I am about ready to drop everything and run to the nearest bathroom.  So I ask the two ladies working there were the closest one is.  The proceed to tell me the location, but then say that I am free to use their bathroom.  Thank goodness!    After the RR break, I head back to the racks.  Now me being a plus size gal, I had a feeling plus size maternity clothes would be hard to find.  Not here!  Found a great pair of 1x jeans!  Got another pair 50% off!  The jeans were so comfortable I decided to wear them out of the store!  Oh sweet relief!  Clothes Selection = 5 stars Sales Staff = 5 stars  Will I be back to Motherhood Maternity?  I think so!!

If you're in search of food, keep driving.   If you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.    I used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  "Penny's Pies".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.     Keep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.     J ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.    J gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.    Our dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as "vegetables".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.    The waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.    When the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true "Penny's Pie".  More like a bad knockoff.      The only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.    We stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.  And we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.    And - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)

We went to see Lisa Lampanelli this past Saturday night at Comerica.    Pros -   Layout is very good.  Probably not a bad seat in the house.    Acoustics were impeccable.  Cons -   Seats.  If you're a plus size person, you'll most likely be squished in a seat.  Saw a guy in front of us have 1/4 of his seat invaded by the dude seated next to him.  Neither him nor the big guy looked too comfortable.  The seats/arms are not adjustable.    Restrooms.  Is there like 1 restroom for each sex in that entire place?   Parking.  City of Phoenix - you suck for having people to feed meters until 8pm on a Saturday!!  Got downtown around 5:00pm. In total, fed $4.00 into the meter to park across from the venue.  Still better than $10 to park in a garage.

Jaryd is plain and simple - AWESOME!!!    Screen on my S3...replaced.  Screen cover - replaced.  Speaker - replaced.  Helped me pick out a case so if I drop my phone, it wont shatter again.    This Sprint repair store is honestly about 15 miles out of the way, but if I ever need any work done on my phone again...I'm coming to this store to have Jaryd work on it.

When my truck was having a hard time turning over (starting), my mom became concerned that I'd be stranded somewhere.  35+ weeks pregnant and the summer heat = not a good combination.  So when I was out visiting her on her side of town this past Saturday, she suggested we stop by Big O and have them test my battery, starter, and alternator.    I pulled up and she went inside and asked the guy at the counter if they could run the few tests.  They guy said it would be about 20 minutes and asked what was happening.  My mom then said, "Well its my daughter's vehicle...she's outside and she'll be able to tell you better than I can."    They walk out to the truck and the guy asks me what was going on.  I explained to him how it was not turning over like it should.  He told me to pull up to a bay door and someone would be out to have a look at it in a minute.  I guess him seeing I was extremely pregnant, he didnt want me waiting.  I pulled up to the bay door and a service guy walked out to the truck less than a minute later.  With 5 minutes, everything tested out fine.  The tech said that something was possibly draining power away from my battery (robbing it from the starter).  He made his suggestions to which I took them. I go inside and ask what I owed for the diagnostics.  They told me, "Just a smile and for you to have a nice afternoon."  After doing what the tech suggested, making sure the A/C is in the off position (as opposed to leaving it in the auto position), I haven't had any issues with starting my vehicle up.  It starts up lickity split.   I tell you what, if I lived on that side on town, I'd make that Big O location my regular stop for any type of service needs.    :)

Went to Sam's Club last Sunday with my mom.  Baby C wears Sam's brand diapers.  They're cheaper and they're just as good as Pamper or Huggies.  Well, we've never had a problem at this Sam's Club ever...until this past weekend.  Granted it was busy.  People were waiting in line.  I got out of the bottleneck and told my mom to follow with the cart.  I head towards the east end of the checkout lanes and find a lane and stand in it..waving my mom over.  No sooner than I wave my mom over, this guy in the next lane completely looks past me and pushes his cart in front of me.  I tell him "Sir, I'm standing right here in line."  He says..No I've been here the whole time.  To which i state, No you've been lane hopping and I've been watching you for the last minute.  You were in the lane over.  He proceeds to get in my face cursing at me in Spanish.  I back down...because a lot of not nice things were going to start flying from my mouth..(which would have ended in me probably punching the guy in the face)...and I state...alright sir..you were standing here the whole time..Though everyone around here knows you're lying.  That's fine.  My mom walks over after the guy starts cursing at me and states..."You do not speak to my daughter that way!"  He then starts cursing her out in Spanish and says..I'll see you outside.  UHH..WTF!?    The whole time this exchange was going on...No one from Sam's Club - a manager, floor sup, NO ONE comes over to intervene.  My mom sees a worker, who looks to be a manager or front end sup..and says...why are you just standing there witnessing this happen?!  He says...well he's a customer.  WELL EXCUSE THE FRACK OUT OF US!  I THOUGHT WE WERE FRACKING CUSTOMERS TOO!?    My mom dials up the police and they're there in no time.  We weren't about to mess around with someone stating they'll "See us outside".  Police get there and the dude bails.    I can only hope that a Sam's Club will open on my side of town.  That way I wont be subjected to verbal abuse from rude customers that is apparently okay with managers/sups at this ghetto Sam's Club.

We've gone to MAC now twice.  First time for the Alton Brown show in October, and then just this past Friday for the Mythbusters tour.    When we went to the AB show, J had originally purchased tickets up in the balcony.  We quickly discovered that there was not enough leg room for him and the House Manager moved us to an unsold section in the balcony.  Seriously awesome!    For the Mythbusters tour, we purposefully purchased tickets in this typically unsold section, because the seats were just that awesome.  We'll make sure to buy those seats every time we see a show at MAC.    The parking situation is alright, I suppose.  $5 to park in their lot.  BUT, you get a slip for $5 off at participating business (I'm guessing in the area), so you kinda get your money back..as long as you go to one of those businesses.  I think next time I'll try to score street parking like I did for the AB show (that was a Sunday show, and y'all now downtown Mesa on Sunday evenings).  It was drizzly out Friday, so we wanted to park close.  But apparently, at least according to the reviews, parking is sometimes free.  It just depends on the act that night.    Given the choice to see a show at MAC or Dodge - I'd pick MAC any day.

Where other than the Renaissance Festival can you see Wenches every weekend?   My Hubby and I are "Rennies" and we head out to the festival at least twice a season ~ In costume!!   Tips:   Opening weekend and President's Day are 2-4-1days. There is usually a flier or coupon needed to partake in the 2-4-1 price. So if you do not mind crowds, head on out for half priced fun! Fry's sells discounted tickets.   If you have allergies, like I do, take a non-drowsy Claritin (analog). Its all dirt out there and if/when the wind kicks up, so will your allergies! Trust me.   Sunblock and a Hat. You'll be thankful you wore them.   Ladies, leave the high heels at home. Wear comfortable shoes.   Cash ~ you'll need it for the food booths.  While there are ATMs on the festival grounds, why pay the fees? Most of the merchants take Credit Cards.   A few of our favorite shows:  Tartanic, Hey Nunnie Nunnie, and Zilch - The Torysteller   Costume rentals are available near the entrance. Prices (if I recall) start at $30.   If you stay til closing, there's a drum circle/jam at Fairhaven Theatre. Always a boatload of fun!

Now, I work literally less than 50 yards from Pacific's and have for the last 8.5 years. I've seen the cafe change hands once.  And though the latest owners are nicer than the previous, nothing else improved.    Most in my department will only go for a soda from the soda fountain, but I would be reluctant to even do that not knowing if they've done the proper daily cleaning.  After buying a rotten hard boiled egg from the cold case, rancid mac salad another time, and a cheese crisp that smelled "south of cheese", I have given up on buying anything from "Pa-sicko's".

Well, yesterday took the cake.  I go in to order a salad (Cobb with no avocado) because 1) I was hungry.  2) Its close and I didn't feel like driving.  And 3) I did not feel like walking over to Paradise.    I go in and order with no problem.  I pay the dude and the gal starts making my salad.   Lettuce - Check.  Chicken (which she chopped right there) - Check  Tomatoes - Check Egg (I get this instead of avocado) - Check Bacon - Check Blue Cheese - Checkkkkkkkkkkkkkkerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  Wait.    She leans down to the cooler below the counter and pulls out a container.   Its not the container that the cheese was purchased in.   It wasn't a Tupperware or gladware type container.    *Drum roll*  The blue cheese was being stored in a Skippy Peanut Butter container.  The size you'd get from Costco.    I stood there dumbfounded for a moment.  I'm handed my salad and I turn and walk out, heading back to work.  I get all the way back to my building and desk...thinking about it the peanut butter cheese situation the whole time.  I then proceed to tell my coworkers, who all burst into laughter.  I'm glad I can at least provide some humor.  I am completely turned off by the salad after a few minutes of staring at the cheese.    I decide to go back to Pacific's and get my money back.  A coworker decides to get out of the building and walk with me.  We get there.  And in short, they were both defensive.  The gal even went to the back and got the big container of cheese saying...this is the cheese.  I said that that might have been where the cheese originally came from, but that isn't where she got the stuff that was on my salad.  That it came from a peanut butter container and that's not the proper method of storage.  And I then said, "Open up the cooler."  The gal then said...give her back her money.   Yeah, give me back my $7.00.  Seriously.  What if I had a peanut allergy?!?!?  I took my money and walked to Paradise, where I got a small Cobb, a small mac&cheese, and 2 cookies for $9.50.  At least I know I don't have to worry about quality, freshness, and storage issues at Paradise.

Went to grab a quick bite yesterday with a colleague and we decided to go to Pita House.  Big Mistake.  We called in our order and the gal on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out.  I guess the computer in the non restaurant section (where we'd be picking up our food) was down.  We weren't told how long it would be or how much our order was going to cost.  I ordered the gyro pita with the house salad.   We head over, pay and get out order (the gal seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my lunch and something is off.  The salad was warm, like wilted warm.  Who wants to eat warm floppy lettuce?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?      My gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my lunch away -  there was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if there's new owners or management...but the quality and customer service has definitely gone downhill.    If I return, it wont be for a while.

Dr. Garrett at SCP is in 1 word - AMAZING!!  When I was on the hunt for a pediatrician for Baby C while I was still pregnant, I asked a few of my fellow colleagues where they take/have taken their kids.  A lot of them mentioned SCP (both the Shea and Osborn locations).  I gave them a call and let them know I was still pregnant, but was looking for a ped for my son when he arrived.  I had questions - they happily answered!  I had a feeling this was going to be a good match.  So fast forward to Baby C's birth.  I knew from the moment I learned I was pregnant that I wanted to breastfeed.  Our first official day at the birthing suites, in the couplet rooms, on the night shift..I had a nurse from HELL.  From manhandling me and Baby C, to belittling my efforts and pushing formula.  At 6am, I snapped.  I literally lost my shit and went a little nuts, crying hysterically and hyperventilating after the Demon Nurse did her final check on us and got her last rude comment in before she left.  Dr. Garrett walked in a minute later.  She calmed me down, told me that my body knew what to do (and I needed to trust that and myself), and then proceeded to go report the nurse to the nursing supervisor.  From that moment - I knew Dr. Garrett had not only Baby C's best interest but mine (and my parenting plan/wishes) as well.  A match made in baby heaven!  Now, unfortunately Baby C suffers from a few respiratory ailments.  The handful of times I've taken him in, Dr. Garrett is pleased with how my treatment has gone thus far (giving breathing treatments, etc) and she basically trusts my judgment (i have my own resp issues, so I know the drill).  Baby C has dodged the hospital admission bullet a few times - because we can get a handle on his breathing and she knows that I'm on the ball with his treatment.  But she knows that if I bring him in to be seen, there's a problem.    OH - She's also not one of those Drs that will just throw antibiotics at the problem.  Not if antibiotics aren't truly warranted.  She in fact isn't the kinda Dr to prescribe meds just to appease the patients parents.  I know a few parents like that...demanding antibiotics for a basic virus that antibiotics wont do squat for (but help with the problem of antibiotic resistant super-bugs).     Oh and the office staff - from the front desk to the nurses are wonderful too!.  OH and Mary Beth is an excellent NP!!  We've seen her a few times when we couldn't get in to see Dr. Garrett.   I can and will shout it from the mountain tops - I love this Peds Office and Dr. Garrett!!  :D

LOVE LOVE LOVEE The Family Birthing Suites at Scottsdale Osborn.  I checked in at 3 pm on June 10th - separate building from hospital.  After talking with the DR on call, we decided that the best course of action, for me and my son, was for me to have a c-section.    Baby C was born at 6:01pm.  8lb 10oz, 21inches long, Healthy, and Screaming!  LOL This birthing center is nice and private.  At most, there's 12 mamas on the floor.  Makes for lots of personal attention and you don't feel like just another number.    I will say that 95% of the staff was wonderful.  The 5% being the night shift staff I had my 2nd night.  TERRIBLE!  The Aid was pretty much nonexistent.  And well the RN on her first hour on shift, she's trying to "Help" my son nurse.  She's not only man-handling my boobs, but shoving my sons face into my tit.  Baby C is screaming and I'm getting frustrated.  Then the nurse starts in with her agenda - her formula pushing agenda.  My husband was ready to cave, but I told her to give us (my son and I) 5 minutes.  She left the room.  I was able to get Baby C calmed down and latched on.  Without shoving my boob into his face/mouth.  But that didn't stop her belittling my efforts.  All night long, I was beaten down with her formula pushing as Baby C was waking up every 2 or so hours to nurse.   I ignored her every time and said each time, "well his pediatrician (who had saw Baby C and I that first day) said that my body knows what to do, and I'm producing colostrum...which is all he needs right now.  My milk will come in in a few days.  And that I need to nurse to get my milk to come in."  This horrid nurse would always say, "he's hungry..that's why he's crying.  You should really give him formula."     Nurse Ratchet came in at 6am making her final rounds, and again I was nursing Baby C.  She finally says to me, "Well you're getting a lot of practice."  I seriously wanted to bitch slap this C You Next Tuesday.  After having little to no sleep, I lost it and started weeping.  She asked if I was alright and I said YUP.  She knew I had hit my breaking point and left.  I then began to sob uncontrollably.  I called my mom, who could bairly understand me over the sobs.  I called J, who also couldn't understand me.  But both made it a point to hurry up and get down to the Birthing Center.  Thankfully, the wonderful team I had my first day was back on shift.  The Aid came and said, as she walked in the door, "How's my superstar (I according to them had been an ideal patient...moving around the room, tending to baby, and walking the hall every few hours with Baby C...letting him get some sun from the skylights in the halls.  Apparently they have to practically drag other new moms out of bed.) this morning?!"  Then when she saw the emotional state I was in, "OMG are you alright?  What's wrong!?"  I cried on her shoulder for a good 20 minutes.  She reassured me and she said she would notify the nursing supervisor of what happened.  Baby C's pediatrician was making rounds and stopped by while the Aid was getting my vitals.  I addressed what happened over night, and said that if that nurse and aid was going to be back on shift, that I wanted to get Baby C and I discharged (if all my dr's approved).  Dr G. was outraged at what happened!!  She's pro-breastfeeding.  So Dr. G went and paid a visit to the nursing supervisor.  I was happy to hear that Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick was going to be returning that evening.    My RN that day was Ruth.  OMG.  RUTH = AWESOME  She's been an RN for at least 50 years and her bedside manner proved it.  She's wonderful.  She knew I had a rough night and wanted Baby C and I to get a nice nap.  So she let me nurse C and came in a few minutes after we finished up, with a bottle of lotion.  Baby C was already asleep.  I'm tellin you, I got the best backrub of my life that morning.  And J said I was out like a light within minutes.     So there you have it.  From one end of the spectrum to the other.  Ruth vs. Nurse Ratchet.    The facility = 5 stars The staff = depends on who you get.   Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick Aid = Negative Stars The rest of the staff = 5+ Stars!  I'm going to go ahead and give 5 stars.

I love this Walgreens.  I love that it's right down the street from my work.  I LOVE  that there's a Take Care Clinic inside (which I only have to pay a $20 copay via my insurance) if I need to see a NP.  I love that I can get not only my meds but also make digital photo prints while waiting for those meds.  Love the fact that I can go in at 2pm or 2am and find what I need - Gotta love 24hr locations!!  Shoot even if I did need something at 2am, I'd still drive to this location rather than the 24hr location off Thomas and 36th Street.  Without even thinking twice about the distance.

So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.    I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the "machine is broken".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that's what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.    Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet.

I am beginning to think my colleague and I are jinxed when it comes to the 2 of us going to lunch together.  Just went here to grab a quick bite - or so I though it was going to be quick.    3 people working at this location.  1 person manning the register and trying to fill orders.  What the other 2 people were doing, I have no clue.  But they sure werent helping the lady out.

I can not say enough good things about Scott, and the whole staff at Hiland's.   When I was in the middle of wedding stuff, I decided I wanted to do a cigar bar for J. I also decided I wanted to get J a humidor and him and his groomsmen a few nice cigars to smoke the eve of the wedding. I visited and priced quite a few places in the valley. Hiland's blew everyone out of the water with price and customer service.   Just about every shop I've been into has a room set up as a humidor where they have their cigars. At Hiland's, the entire shop is a humidor!   I try to stop in every few weeks and pick out a new cigar for J to try. J has admitted to me, I have a knack for picking them out! I don't smoke them, but apparently I know who to pick them!   A few of J's favorite cigars- Acid 5 and 1964 Padron   Usually once a month, Hiland's will have cigar days. Free Lunch and a Free Cigar, usually from 11am - 7pm. Tomorrow, December 17th, is Drew Estate day! We love our Acid cigars! Even more when we can get one for free!

Upon return from our week long Honeymoon, I noticed something was "off" with my 10.5 year old cat, Bubbs. Not eating, lethargic, and just ..well... not himself. A friend referred me to Scottsdale Vet. Clinic, and I could not have been more pleased. I called and took Bubbs in an hour later.   After running tests and getting the results back, he was in liver distress. Poor guy. :( The vet we initially saw (cant remember her name) gave me options for treatment. I asked her to give it to me straight. I was prepared for the worst and did not want to put Bubbs through anything unnecessary. She told me not give up on him. I decided to leave Bubbs in their care for a few days. Pushing fluids via IV instead of Sub-Q.   I was able to call and get as many updates on Bubbs as I wanted the 2.5 days he stayed at the clinic. Dr. D'Monte (the vet who I've spoken with on quite a few occasions) suggested I take Bubbs home as he was getting a little pissy with all the noise there as he got better. Good sign!   Dr. D'Monte was extremely helpful when I needed coaching (via the phone) on how to give Bubbs his medication. With her help, what would escalate into "WWIII" with Bubbs, turned into a "minor conflict." I've spoken with her at least 3 times, each call being at least 20 minutes.   This is a vet who cares!!   A BIG THANK YOU to Dr. D'Monte and the entire staff of Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic!!  OH!  And I almost forgot...Most vet offices Ive found throughout the years close around 6pm.  This place is open from from 7am-11pm!!!

Pet Dental Month is Feb and September so when I was told that Bubbs had some dental issues back in December, I had hoped we would be able to wait it out to get his teeth looked at. He was still eating, but wet food only.   After having priced cat dental cleanings a year ago, I knew I was going to take a hit to the pocketbook. At other vet clinics, I was looking at at least $400. Scottsdale Vet Clinic prices were VERY reasonable! Everything was covered in the 1 price (dependant on your cats age) - from lab work to anesthesia. Extractions were extra, and started at $30.   I was informed I had to start Bubbs on antibiotics a week or so prior, so I headed there to pick up his meds. *DREAD* Thankfully, I was set up with liquid antibiotics and all i needed to do 4 days prior add 1.5ml to his wet food daily. The liquid was a little bit more expensive, but OH MY GAWD...the relief of not having to get him to take a pill 2x a day. THANK YOU to whoever the vet was working that Friday. THANK YOU!   I received 2 calls the day of his procedure letting me know how Bubbs was doing. Picked him up at 4:30 that afternoon. I requested to speak with Dr. D'Monte (who performed the cleaning). She is about the nicest and most compassionate vet I have ever dealt with. We talked for about 20 minutes or so, and I asked everything under the sun. Mainly, how to get Bubbs back on dry food and teeth cleanings at home.   Dr. D'Monte suggested I give Bubbs some time because he did just have dental surgery (had 3 teeth extracted..not too bad for a 11yr old cat), but that I could integrate a little dry with the wet in a few days. But that i needed to watch his food and water intake for the next 24hours, to make sure he didn't eat/drink too much. When I asked about giving him a pain reliever and more antibiotics (as had been mentioned to me the week prior), Dr. D'Monte mentioned that they had Bubbs taken care of. They'd given him a shot to take care of the pain for a few days, along with a shot to cover the antibiotics. AWESOME!!!   The following morning, after I go to fill the other 2 cats food bowls (with dry food), I turn to see Bubbs eating from one of the bowls! Guess all he needed was the 3 teeth pulled!  YAY!!    So a great big THANK YOU to Dr. D'Monte and the entire staff at Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic!!!

I remember growing up and always seeing a 1 or 2lb box of See's on the end table in the living room. Pops has a huge sweet tooth, though you couldn't tell to look at him. So, usually the only time I go to See's is when I'm buying him a box for Father's Day/Christmas/His Birthday....etc etc. Thanks to Costco and their discounted gift certificates on 2lbs of See's, I'm not breaking the bank buying Pops candy.   Not even 20 minutes ago, my fellow colleague said to me "I'm going to be bad and walk to See's, as they have my Tipperary BonBons right now!" She asks if I want anything, and of course I say no. Then asks me the fatal question, "Do you want to take a walk with me?" Not wanting to pass up on a walk, I go with thinking as long as I don't bring any money, I'll be fine.   WRONG! I forgot about the free samples they give. Before I could say no, the gal hands me a Milk Chocolate Peanut Nougat piece. Son of a Bi*ch! I ask which pieces are less in calories as I'm picking up my wedding dress this Friday and I need to make sure my ass fits in it. LOL. She says the Milk Bordeaux (which is unfortunate because my favorite piece is the Almond Square) and I ask if I can swap the Peanut Nougat for the Bordeaux. She then says, well you can keep the Nougat and I'll just give you the Bordeaux. AWESOME!   My colleague makes her purchase and the two gals working congratulate me on my upcoming nuptials and we leave. My boss was very appreciative of the Peanut Nougat piece I dropped off at her desk. And the Milk Bordeaux, amazing as always. However, not as amazing as an Almond Square would have been. ; )

I don't know why I haven't written a review until now, but I LOVE Whitey's!  Been going here for well over a year.    My SUV had a rear window regulator that went out.  After getting a quote from my old mechanic (chain) while i had it in for a LOF, and practically falling out of my seat, I said that i could live without rolling that window down for a while.  A few months later, the glass slipped all the way down and unless i wanted to have the wind blowing through my sons hair in the backseat and potentially have critters/cats making a nighttime home out of my vehicle, I had to do something fast.    I called Whitey's and Mike gave me a quote over the phone.  The quote was $100 less for the same repair the chain wanted.  I told Mike, "When can I bring it in!?" I had my SUV back in less than a day.    While I'm pretty car savvy (having worked for a car dealership/parts dept and had to maintain my own work truck), auto repairs is an area that history shows women can and have be taken to the cleaners.  So ladies, have no fear.  Whitey's is by far one of the most honest repair shops that I've found in a long long time.

So pregnancy has had me craving Schlotzsky's Turkey Club.  Like every freakin Friday.  I had to bite the bullet a few weeks back and go over on my own because my coworker who goes with me gets off work early fridays.      I have to say, the Tattoo guy and the cashier gal have redeemed themselves and this Schlotzsky's, in my eyes.  Thankfully I havent seen the other dude.    Oh, and my custom order has not been an issue which requires problem solving.    THANK GOODNESS for the redemption!  They gain 1 star from my last review.  :)

UPDATE 08/01/10 - Unfortunately, Sam is no longer at Applause.  But I've followed her to where she's now working.  After getting a horrible set of Gel nails for the first time back in April at another place, I started Googling salons around where I work.  I read up on the reviews for Applause, and figured I'd give them a try.    The salon is clean, everyone is friendly, and I couldnt have been happier.    Sam does a WONDERFUL job with my nails each time!

Pretty good pizza.  Alright price.    The pizza has a garlic flavor to it in the crust, which we do not mind.  We're garlic heads.  I always ask for some hot wing sauce on the side for dipping.  The first time I did, I was expecting to pay for it like I do (and you have to pay for everything) at Gus'.  But they just gave it to me, a decent sized container, for free.   I like the fact that at this location, there's a drive-through for phone orders.  I can all in my order ahead of time and then drive over, pay for, and pick up our eats without leaving my vehicle!

I have been going to Tottie's now for over a year and have never had a bad experience.  I always order the same thing (boring, I know)-  Kang Keow Wan (Green Curry - Chicken) with no mushrooms, no thai basil, medium spicy, and an extra rice.  I always have enough curry to last at least 2 more lunches!  So for $8.00, I have lunch for 3 days.    I've turned on a lot of co-workers to Totties and we now have "Thai Tuesdays" on a somewhat regular basis, and we get Tottie's to-go.   Exteremly nice staff (even when we're calling in 6+ orders) and delicious food!  Love Tottie's!!

I was referred her by my PCP, Dr. Lillo.  Checked to see if Dr. Cohen was a part of my insurance plans APN (Performance Network..deeper discounts if you use APN providers) and sure enough he was listed!    My first visit - Dr. Cohen confirms what Dr. Lillo told me in my wellness visit.  Immediately wants to jump into action and get testing done.    My second visit - First tests in office.  Painless.  And I received information about my other test - which had been approved by my insurance.   The office staff is on the ball with contacting my insurance to make sure pre-auths are obtained.  I like that.    I can only hope that when all is said and done, I'll be breathing easier.  :)

Recap - I go in, get a whole bunch of tests done (CT, allergy testing, hearing test, sleep study) and after my second visit, I am told that we'll do surgery, but after allergy therapy.  So I proceed to go every 5-7 days for shots.  (note when my first review happened - Jan 2014)  My last appointment to this office was back in October 2014.  I was fed up with the issues with my nose and throat, so I scheduled a regular appointment to see Dr. Cohen.  I am basically told that they CAN do the surgery, BUT that the recovery is very rough.  That both procedures are done at the same time. Again that the recovery is very tough And that surgery may not solve my issue, but that my weight may be part of the issue, . Uh, I know I'm heavy.  So on top of the 10 months I've wasted, I've wasted money ($3200 deductible + coinsurance) and you're basically telling me that you cant help me. Unless I want to continue doing the shots.  Fantastic.  Dr. Cohen even had Dr. Lee come in to talk to me.  So thanks for a whole lotta nothin.

I've gone to this facility now twice.  Once for Little C earlier this year, and most recently, this past Monday for myself.    Super fast check-in.  Even faster to get you back for your procedure.  Friendly techs.    From now on, any imaging that's needed, I'm going to make sure that we go here.

Cute little kids clothing shop next door to my salon. A little on the pricy side, but I don't expect less in that area.   Bought Baby C the following -  a pair of sunglasses...$ 6   a Curious George stuffed toy...$ 20 and the best purchase...although very expensive in J's opinion...  handmade doggy hooded towel...$ 45  Now I know what you're thinking...I'm crazy for spending $ 45 on a towel. Why not get 3 packs of hooded towels you can get from target or babies r us at that price. Well let me tell you, we have those target and babies r us towels. They are flimsy, suck at absorbing, and Baby C always got chilled.  This towel I purchased was top quality and an adult size bath towel. Baby C loves it and I can get him immediately warm from his bath. :)  Good purchase and a great store!

I've been going to King's for quite a few years now - both take out and sit down. Have to say that my favorite dish is the Pineapple Shrimp, second being the cinnamon sugar donut thingies (uber good, but oh so bad for you!) Food is always hot. And they are always on top of their game with drink refills/removal of finished plates.

New Owners - HUGE IMPROVEMENT!!   This is the only buffet I can get J to go to. That's saying a lot! His opinion, buffets do a lot of dishes half-assed, instead of a few dishes really well. But this one is alright.   Pineapple Shrimp is still my favorite. Second being the rice noodles. :)

I am surprised i haven't written a review until now. I have been coming off and on to us nails for well over 12 years. Back when Vivi's dad was still alive. Since his passing a couple years ago, Vivi has taken over and done a fine job with the nail shop, with remodeling and other updates. When i started coming in the regular again,  Vivi remembered my name my first visit back. That says a lot with them having hundreds of clients. Always a decent manicure or pedicure. And at least 200 nail polish colors to choose from or mix and match.   I only wish they were open on Sundays. But ya know, that's okay as Sunday should be a day of rest. Maybe if they were open late and had a liquor license. Lol martinis and manis! :)

Cheapest Shell gas in the valley!  Usually .10 cheaper than other stations. Clean!  Never a wait for a pump!    Bonus - There's a Wells Fargo ATM outside the Circle K.

I swung by Super Burrito after I dropped the baby off at daycare this morning.  Figured I'd try a chorizo and egg burrito.  While it was greasy, I didnt think it was SO greasy that it would trigger a Non-Gallbladder attack.  I was wrong.  So. Very. Wrong.    If I'm ever in the need of a full colon-cleansing, I'll return to Super Burrito.

I was first introduced to Fiesta about 6 years ago by a friend of mine at the time, who lived around the corner. The friendship with her did not last, but my love for Fiesta Burrito did! From the Carne Asada or Bean and Cheese burrito to the Adobada tacos, Fiesta rocks!   One morning at work, my urge to skip my usual yogurt or oatmeal overcame me and I wanted a burrito (almost always a bean and cheese. yeah for breakfast. I'm strange like that!). I announced that I was going to my favorite taco shop and the questions starting rolling in. Where is this place? Are they good? etc etc. By the time I left, I had six orders, not including mine. So now every time I have a burrito urge, I try to keep it to myself, lest 6+ orders. Selfish, yeah. But that saves me on having to dole out 15 cups of red, green, and/or pico. :P   Speaking of red, green, and pico - try to only get 2 cups of green for myself. Though really I could easily use about 6 of them in one sitting. I would probably be kicking myself the next day.   HOW in the heck does Adam Richman - Man vs Food eat all that spicy stuff and not cry the next day on the toilet?!?   Anyhow - CLEAN, Fast, with Courteous employees. Did I mention clean??? This is NOT your average "-bertos" taco/burrito shop people!!

When I am under a lot of stress, it seems to accumulate in my right shoulder. The pain was so intense back in March, I decided to go back to the chiropractor. Now, I am the type of person that does not enjoy it when a chiropractor says, you've got to come 3-4 times a week for the next 2 months. I've had that happen before. And I wasn't even in pain! Monthly adjustments is what I enjoy.   So, I've been going to American Chiropractic since March 2010 via a referral from a coworker. My first visit included a entire workup. Xrays taken, back/shoulder adjustment, and e-stem. Dr. Amoia recommended treatment 2 times a week for 4 weeks. Then as I needed it.   Now, I have decent health insurance. But my flippin co-pay for a specialist is $50. I knew via my coworker that American Chiropractic had all types specials. Pre-pay plans where you pay a discounted amount for 4 treatments. At the time a massage and adjustment plan, which I loved! They really work with you at American Chiro!   The office staff is extremely friendly. The therapists are fantastic! And the Dr's are, in my opinion, miracle workers!   I highly recommend them!!

Take Two for the seach of the smoothie.    Since being let down yesterday getting my smoothie for breakfast, I decided to hit up this location a short jaunt from the house, but on the way to work.    I order at the drive-thru this morning a small Strawberry Banana Smoothie.  Get to the window and am told.  Its not ready.  It will be in 15 minutes.  I say thanks and drive off.   DAYUM!  Cant a pregnant woman fulfill a breakfast craving?!    You'd think that with a 24hr drive-thru operation that they'd have an item ready that would more likely than not, be consumed during breakfast hours!!

Take Three on the breakfast prego craving.    Since I was already on McDowell and work in Old Town Scottsdale...I decided to drive over the hill and hit up this Jack In The Box.    I order at the drive-thru this morning a small Strawberry Banana Smoothie.  "That will be $3.xx, please pull up to the window."   SWEET!!!  I'm getting my breakfast smoothie!!     I get to the window and am told.  Its not ready.  It will be in 15 minutes.  I say thanks and drive off .  SERIOUSLY!??!  Again, you'd think that with a 24hr drive-thru operation that they'd have an item ready that would more likely than not, be consumed during breakfast hours!!  Must be a company policy or something to not have the smoothie machines up, running, and ready to go before 6am.   Jack - You SUCK!

The main reason I like shopping at Albertsons - The meat counter.  When its on sale, I can get 93% fat free ground beef...at times for less than $3 a lb (when purchasing more than 3 lbs).    I also love the deli counter and bakery.  Can and box prices are a little more expensive than your Frys and definitely Walmart.  So I try to just stick to the meat, deli, and bakery counters here.      This Albertsons is right on the way home from work, and by the daycare, so I can swing by here and grab what I need and then go pick up Baby C.  :)

This is one of the two Ace Hardware stores I shop at.  I come to Paul's if I'm stopping by after or during work.  I am in the middle of rearranging/decorating our guest bedroom. After I started moving things around, I realized that the outlet setup in the room is horrible! I needed an extension cord.   I made Paul's my first stop yesterday during my lunch hour errands run and pull into the parking lot to see a BBQ going on. I bypass the BBQ tents and head inside. I am greeted and told where I can find the extension cords. Another employee is standing in the isle I need, and asks if i need help. I tell him what I'm looking for and he says, "Well you've found the right isle!" He walked me down the isle and showed me the different selections. After I explained what would be plugged into the cord he pointed me to the Ace brand, which was the least expensive. 6ft cord for less than $2.00. I grabbed 2 and headed up front to checkout.   Checkout was quick and the cashier said to make sure I stop by and grab lunch for Contractor Appreciation Day.   So, for under $5.00, I got 2 extension cords...and lunch! SCORE! :)   I've bought anything and everything here.  From having keys made, glass cut (a new section of pane), to gardening supplies.  This is my during work hours and immediately after work Ace!  PS - The guest bedroom is officially in order now! I'm sure J's nephew will appreciate not sleeping on the floor tomorrow night.  LOL

Decided to try this Midas out cause my regular place was 2 weeks out for an appointment. Came here with the Yukon with an oil change Catalina coupon from Albertsons. Figured if my regular place couldn't get me in, i could wait 1 day and come here.   My satisfaction with this Midas is conveyed by the fact that I've been here now 2 more times in the last 2 weeks for 2 different vehicles using Groupon.  Great service. Low pressure.  Great job Andrew!

I went to get a LOF on the Beast last Wednesday. I inform Mike of a noise I'm hearing coming from the drivers side. He said they'd check into it. He comes back a little while later and says I need a new wheel bearing assembly and says he'll show me the old part. He brings me the part after it's taken off to show me and not knowing what i was really looking at, I say okay, lets get it fixed up and me back on the road. Almost $700 out of pocket. He did give me a discount as a repeat (with multiple vehicles) customer. So that was nice.   A few days later, I'm hearing the same noise. I call and speaking to another guy who says to bring it back in.  So I take it in this AM for a 0730 appointment. James is there and after I get him up to speed - James looking at my service records/notes and mentions that it could be the mode door actuator, which he sees needs replacing in the service notes. I state that the noise is coming from outside the vehicle. The service guy then takes it for a test drive. About 45 minutes later, I ask if they've found anything.  He mentions to me that they're checking the transmission fluid level to see if they're low. And I say, isn't that one of the fluids that should have been topped off last week, if it was needed???  Silence.  He says the wheel bearing assembly was masking the transmission noise. I say, um this is the same noise, the same location, the same intervals and only when breaking. James says, we'll let you know what we find.   After about another 20 minutes, he comes over by the waiting area. I turn around and he doesn't come in but and jingles my keys, tells me it's coming from the transmission, tells me his guy doesn't know or isn't qualified for transmissions (cant remember his exact words), and to go down the street to AAMCO, basically dismisses me and disappears.  I pack up my stuff and leave kind of dumbfounded. Same noise, coming from the same location, at same intervals and only when breaking as last week when I was told it was the wheel bearing assembly. :(  Update - I took it to another midas location immediately Friday and they were not able to get the vehicle to produce the noise. They however did find a socket was still on the vehicle. How long it had been there, if it was left on after leaving the scottsdale shop or if it had been on there since my last LOF from there a few months ago, who knows. Coincidentally, I haven't heard the noise since Friday after the visit to the other shop and them finding the socket.

When you pay for express service - That's what you get!!  Took in my new RX for glasses on the 28th, picked out frames, and wasnt expecting a call until the 5th to pick up my glasses.  I got a call once the store opened on Feb 1st.  I was very pleased!  Decent selection of frames.  And unbeatable prices!!  I look forward to doing business again with Lesco!  :)

The fiance was craving cheese steaks and our local burger/sandwich joint is closed on Sundays. So, we decided to try out DeFalco's. Reading the reviews, I saw that the wait time is sometimes an issue, so I called in our order in advance. The order consisted of 1 whole cheese steak w/ everything and 1 half w/ everything.    Upon arrival, I was given the total of $21 and some change. Having seen the online menu with pricing, I was prepared for the bill to be somewhere around $15, so I was a little shocked when I was told it was over $20. I verified the order with the man and found that I was charged for and made one extra whole sandwich. I told the cashier that the order was incorrect, to which he said "I was the one who took the phone order and it was for 2 whole and 1 half sandwiches." He proceeded to grab the order slip and show me. I replied, "Well, I'm the person who called in the order and specifically asked for 1 whole for my finance and 1 half for myself." He stood there after my explanation as if expecting me to pay for the additional sandwich. After he realized that I was not going to pay for his mistake, he took the second whole sandwich back and rerang the bill. The new total came to $13.00+ tax, an amount within the range I was expecting to pay.    Even though the sandwiches were delicious, we are hesitant to return. We may try DeFalco's again, only next time as walk-in customers

Went back and tried DeFalco's last night, a to-go order. I decided to forgo calling in the order to avoid the same thing happening as the last time. I walked up to the counter and am relieved that the guy I dealt with the first time was not taking my order. After the long day I had had at work, I was not prepared to deal with him! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I was shocked as I was asked what type of bread I'd like. That question was not asked of me over the phone for the first visit.   J's sandwich - Whole cheese steak with everything  My sandwich (went for something different this time) - Half eggplant parmesan   Once again, the sandwiches were AWESOME! The bread was nice and soft. So soft in fact that the sandwich was falling apart on J. But he enjoyed every bite. He said for next time, he's going for just a half sandwich. But, I'm sure DeFalco's leftovers are just as delicious!  DeFalco's redeemed themselves!  :D

I was very upset when the tire shop my family had been going to went under (DARN this economy!) last year. No sooner than I find out that news, I discover a screw in one of my tires. I take it to my now FORMER car repair shop to be fixed. They inform me that the tire cant (because its too close to the sidewall) be repaired, and that I need all new tires - $800.   Feeling that something wasn't right, I take it to Discount. The guy goes out and looks at the tire and pops out the screw. I immediately ask if the tire needs to be fixed and he informs me that it didn't puncture the tire and I wasn't losing pressure. He has the tire taken off and checked to be sure. 10 minutes later, my truck is pulled out and I'm informed that the tire is fine and I have about 10,000 more miles left on all of them.   Cost - FREE!    Now 10,000 miles later, I was in desperate need of tires. I decide to go back to Discount and made a same day appointment.   I had a lot of questions about the tires that the salesguy was showing me.  He answered every one.    In and out in about 1hour and left feeling like I did not get ripped off!     THANKS DISCOUNT!!  :)

Fast, Friendly, and HONEST!    Returned to Discount this past Friday to have my tires on "The Beast" checked and possibly rotated.  I called ahead to see if I needed to get an appointment, but the guy said i could just come on in and they'd have me in and out in about 30 minutes.  I dropped off Baby C at daycare and headed across the way.  The guy at the counter checked my tires and said that they were wearing pretty evenly - when the tread gets to a "5", the tire should be replaced..and I guess my tires are at an "8".  But he did inform me that I should come back in about 1000 miles for a rotation.  He said to pull around to the side so they could check the tire pressure.    The guy (a different guy) that was checking the tire pressure was fast and friendly.  He even checked my spare (I had to ask though...we're heading out of town and i wanted to make sure the spare was not flat).  He told me that the spare was 11 years old, but it still had decent pressure in it.  I guess that is something i missed when I bought "The Beast" used a year ago from the dealership.  I checked all the tires, but didn't think about the spare.  FAIL on my part.    Due to the fact that the spare was as old as it was, they are not able to air it up...which was fine.  I was just glad that he informed me that I had a decades old spare.    I'll be going back here in a few weeks to get a new spare tire.  Its too bad I don't need a new set, or else I could just swap out the best old tire for the spare.  Oh well.  :)

After letting J know I was taking him out to dinner for his birthday last night, I had to decide on a place to go. He wanted Indian. I wanted...something different. I told him, "We're getting Ethiopian." His reaction and response, "Umm, I'm trusting you on this one!" LOL  He'll try anything, as long as "animal flesh" is to be consumed. So, off we went to Blue Nile for dinner!   The plaza where its located should have the "Its a Small World" song playing, because there is everything from Pizza to Thai in that plaza!   We walk inside, and being the only ones there, we pick out what i think is the best table in the place (in the traditional seating area, in the corner). We sit down and Amir, our server, is extremely helpful! He suggests we try the Meat Lover's Combo for J, and the Vegan Combo for myself. We also order some Chicken Sambussa.   The Sambussa's come out about 10 minutes later, nice and hot. J bites into one and says, "This is awesome!" Whew! Dodged a bullet there! I try one and it reminds us a little of an egg-roll. Tasty! NEXT!   Our dinner comes out a few minutes later, and Amir points out all the different dishes we ordered - Which one was which. We tear into the injera and dig in! Wonderful!!! We sampled each others dishes, and the results are as follows :   J's favorites in order - Zegeney, Inguday, Lamb Tebbs, and Misir Watt  J's least favorite - Chicken Tebbs (J said the chicken was a little dry)  My favorites in order - Shrimp Watt/Misir Watt (TIE), Zegeney, Begerdan, and Tikil Gomen/Atkilt Watt (TIE).  My least favorite - Kik Alitcha (we got to try it for free, thank goodness)   They were out of the Gomen Watt, which was unfortunate. Oh well! Next Time!! Cause we'll be back!!  :)

Since 2004, I have been ordering the same thing from Cheba Hut - "Nug" (4inch) Griefo on Garlic/Herb with all the greens/veg they have but mushrooms and cucumbers! Extra pickle please! Always the same. Never changing. No, I will not try another sandwich. I'm addicted to the Griefo, thank you very much. My name is Jill, and I'm a Cheba Hut Griefo addict.   (HI JILL!)   While sometimes the service can be somewhat slow, the product they produce is IMO, fantastic! Quality takes time. Even more time if a pothead is behind the counter making your sandwich. ;)

Prenatal massages for less than $40 for an hour?!  SIGN ME UP!    As a birthday gift (February), J got me a gift certificate for a prenatal massage at SWIHA.  I did not cash it in until April, because I wanted to be a little further along in my pregnancy...when I knew I would need the massage the most.    After my first visit, I was hooked!  I started booking regular Friday afternoon appointments every 2 weeks.  And at $33 for an hour...for a student..who's received the necessary prenatal massage training....it was not breaking the bank!  Thanks SWIHA for making the last month of my pregnancy tolerable!  :)

Well that's the last time we order from Gus'. In the 5 years we've been getting delivery from and using a credit card...never have we had to give an imprint of the credit card used. And when the kid asked for the card to make the impression...I refused. He said we couldn't get our food if I didn't. Mind you this is AFTER I sign the card payment slip!! I call Gus' to verify and some how getting that imprint is secure and how they verify the card.  BS!!!  The drivers can read...at least I hope...and can read the last 4#s of the card and verify it on the credit card receipt! The gal said no to this request. So I asked for the card to be refunded. I'll keep an eye out in 7 or so days for that to be refunded.   They nickel and dime you for everything and then if you're paying with a card and getting delivery...they subject you to credit card number theft.   Thanks but NO thanks Gus'. I've saved $20+, avoided potential credit card fraud, and am now yelping from my phone while I wait to order our Chipotle chicken burritos.  UPDATE - 11/26/12 So I received a refund to my card - For $5....not the $21 that had been charged to my card.  I called and spoke with a gal on 11/21/12  and she took my number to give to her boss.  I'm still waiting for that phone call from "the boss."

To quote Jules from Pulp Fiction, "Mmmmmm...this IS a tasty burger!"  The Tijuana Torpedo is especially good!  Jalapeno jack and green chili on top of flame-broiled tasty beef goodness!     Have had the fries (of course), mushrooms, and zucchini.  All which are pretty good.    If you go on a Saturday during lunchtime, parking can be kinda of crappy.  Finding a table might be interesting.  And the line inside to place your order, get a tasty beverage, wait for your grub, and pay....a kluster-F!    BUT, the burger is worth it.    The condiment bar is super sweet!  Always fresh and stocked.  At least when I've gone it has been.    This place is CASH ONLY, so plan accordingly.  Unless you like paying ATM fees!

I could seriously smack the concierge desk gal where we stayed for recommending this place.  I was planning on taking J to a buffet dinner while we were in Vegas (it was pretty much his first trip), either at the Wynn or Planet Hollywood.  However, since Garden Court was recommended by a local, I figured it had to be decent.    WRONG!    The price was right (less than $20 a person) but the food was terrible!  Seriously, the only good thing about the entire visit was the salad bar.    I guess the saying in this case is true ~  You get what you pay for.

Seriously, if I could give Mr. Lucky's 100 stars, I would!  I am SO glad that I'm a tightwad and looked at the Vegas.com cheap eats page.  If I had not, I would have never known about the gem that was around the corner from where we were staying.    The off menu Gambler's Special ~ 5-6oz steak, grilled shrimp, mashed potatoes, and a side salad ~ $7.77.   (Looks around and whispers)  "I'll have the $7.77 special." I felt dirty ordering it.   LOL  Salad - Decent sized.  Cherry tomatoes were a nice touch.  Steak - Cooked medium rare - OMG THE BOMB!  Perfectly cooked.  Nicely seasoned.  This was just like the steak we grill for ourselves at home.   Mashed Potatoes - Pretty good.  Nice and smooth. Not gluey.   Shrimp - Now, I love shrimp.  J on the other hand does not.  He actually ate his!  That's saying something!!    Now the portions are probably on the small side, but they were more than enough for J and I.  I was a little worried that J would still be hungry afterwards, but said he was stuffed!  We were not expecting much from a steak dinner that costs less than $8.00 and were pleasently surprised!    We went back a total of 3 times in the 4 days we were there.  The last being Monday morning for the $6.99 steak and eggs breakfast (steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast).  Its $4.99 if you have a players card.    Service:   Friday Night - Seemed our server had other things on his mind.   Sunday Night - Improved.  A little more attentive.  Monday Morning - This server ROCKED!!!!  We were techinally 2 minutes late for the steak and eggs special, but he gave it to us anyway.  On the ball with the drink refills.    I definitely think Mr. Lucky's will be a regular spot for us on Vegas trips in the future.

First time I went to Wildflower I was with my friend Jarrett.  It was me, Jarrett, and her 1yr old son T.    LOVE LOVE LOVED Wildflower from the moment we got our grub.  I've been back quite a few times.  And have gotten take out for J and myself for dinner.     His opinion - "It's alright.  A bit overpriced, but the sandwiches are okay.  They need to tone down the weirdness of their ingredient combos and that slaw crap they give you is just atrocious."  LOL    Potato Cream Cheese soup - YUM!  So Yum in fact that on my first visit, T ate a good portion of my soup.  Kid tested recipe!  :)    Emerald Spinach salad - Very tasty!!! spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette   Their bread is almost a little too crusty for me, but its still good.    Friendly staff.  Speedy service!  Even when you place your order to-go upon arrival.     We'll have to go there to try breakfast in the future!

A slice of Americana!  J and I LOVE seeing movies at the Drive-In and have been going for quite a few years now...  Pros -  2 movies for $6.50!  If its a new huge release, its 1 movie for $6.50 (still beats the theater) Bring in your own food and drinks.   Relax in your favorite folding chair, throw a mattress in the back of your pickup truck, or recline in your car.  Hell we've seen people pack an old couch/loveseat in their truckbed!    Only 1 Con -  Some of the stations they broadcast on are on the weak side.  I would have preferred watching "Thor" (Screen #6) this past weekend without hearing 101.5 bleed through.

Went this past Saturday to see the new X-Men movie.  The radio quality was improved, but maybe that is because we were on Screen #1 instead of Screen #6.   One suggestion to the owner/manager -   Screen 1's "humps" that let you know where to park/where the isle is could seriously use "re-humping".  Even though we got there 1hr early, the dumb@ss who got in before use threw the row of cars off infront of us off.  Seeing cars drive (way too fast) 5 feet away from your chairs because someone is a drive-in novice and doesnt know where to park,  makes J and I a little uneasy.   Re-Hump the Humps!!  :D

With Gelato Spot across the street from work, a lot of my co-workers head over for everything from coffee to lunch.  They all rave about it non-stop.  I finally bit the bullet and let a work friend drag me across the street to Gelato Spot for lunch today, after much hesitation.  Maybe it is the fact that it started out as a dessert place, which had since morphed into a coffee and pizza joint.   WHAT THE HELL WAS I WAITING FOR!?!?    Had the Chicken Louie Panini with a side salad.    Chicken Louie Breakdown - Toasted..with a slight char to the bread..yum! Sliced Tomatoes - Nice and fresh.  Not mushy.  Bacon - Could have been a little crispier, but bacon makes everything better! Avocado - 86'ed that.  Louie Dressing - Slightly tangy, slightly sweet.  Some might compare it to thousand island, but its not as thick.   Blue Cheese - GImme the funk!  YUM! Chives - Chives is chives.   Side Salad Breakdown - Now, this is why I'm not giving Gspot 5 stars.  I was given the option of caesar or house.  I asked for the house.   Romaine - Fresh and crisp. Cherry Tomatoes - Fresh with that pop when you bite into it.  Carrots - chopped, and not grated.  Cant stand grated carrots. :)  House Dressing - The salad was drenched in oil...total turnoff.   Flat Bread - Very tasty!    Will I return to GSpot?  Yes!  I wanna see if they can do a custom panini.  Will I order a side salad again?  Probably not, unless I can request a different dressing on the side.    But salad or not, I think I know where I'm having lunch again this week!!  :)

I am a G-Spot addict!  Had to limit myself from going every week though.    Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.  It was his first time to try gelato.  He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!    The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) "I eated it" and forgot to take a photo first.   :)  My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!   The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!   The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!!    G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.  Baby C wanted something sweet!   :D

J and I have gone to this location now twice in the last week (having usually gone to the Ray location).  Our birthing classes started last Thursday night and we decided to head to Jason's for dinner before class last week.  We decided to go back again yesterday evening before class.   HUGE potatoes.  Big enough that we split it.  I get a 1 trip salad bowl and J got a half sandwich.  Word to the wise though on the potatoes.  Ask for the toppings, if you're getting a Plane Jane, on the side.  They load it up with butter, cheese, and sour cream.  We ordered all of our stuff on the side last night.   Friendly and helpful staff.  Not sure if we'll be going back next Thursday or not before class again.  But I'm pretty sure that we will.    Oh and did I mention the free yogurt?!  Add a little granola and some dried fruit on top....YUM!!   :)

12:00pm, I call in my order for pick-up. The guy tells me that it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. WOAH! Not too bad for lunchtime. I was prepared to kick myself for not being able to make up my mind on where I wanted to go for lunch today. I was expecting to have to wait 30-45 minutes. So, I'm now enjoying the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) Pita. Hold the Tahini and Garlic Dip/Sauce, add Tsatziki. Never a problem with customizing your order! I walk in and there is my order waiting for me! I am in and out the door in less than 3 minutes. Awesome!   My only gripe, and its not about the restaurant - parking. Oh and people not knowing how to drive in that flippin parking lot. Granted, I went during lunchtime and PJ is right next to another busy restaurant. Its a battle over parking spaces. And some resort to parking in firelanes. Okay, so I cant pull into this parking space, and it appears no one wants to attempt it due to some tard temporarily blocking half the lane. I am more precise backing my truck in the spot than pulling in anyway!    Tasty Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) Pita.  YUM!

I've never had falafel from anywhere but P.J and H.B (in Tempe) before, but when a friend of mine wanted to meet me for lunch here on Monday, I jumped at the chance to try a new place.   I ordered the falafel pita (of course) and a choice of soup or salad came with the meal.  I opted for the salad.  Both the salad and falafel were tasty.   Price for my meal - Under $6   My only gripe is when I was asked what I wanted to drink after I sat down.  Our food came out, and yet I was still without a beverage.  So, I asked again for a glass of water.  Finally 5 minutes later, she brought me a glass.    Other than the beverage oversight, everything was great.

Tasty! Tasty! Tasty!  Did I mention that the food here is tasty?!  LOL  I love the fact that they are open at 6am, so hit up the drive-thru and grab breakfast before work.  I've had the Cali Club and the Veggie Burrito.  The cali club is by far my favorite!  The veggie burrito was good, but a little on the bland side (even with the salsa).  Added salt and pepper after the first few bites, and it was then prefect.    This place can get super packed for during the brunch/lunch hour, and the parking lot is really small. so ordering ahead is always advised.    Think I'll go get a Cali Club tomorrow for breakfast!  :D

The manager of this location is awesome! And Miss Andrea is fantastic with the kids (Beasts)! :)  Little C has so much fun at class.  The teachers spray down the mat and equipment after every class, so that's kinda comforting.      Parent participation is kinda hit or miss, depending on which class you attend.  You can go to a class where every parent is up and running around with/after their kids during exploration time during class.  Or go to another where they're sitting down watching the kids run around.  The kids seem to have a great time regardless.  If you're the type of parent that gets involved (like J and I), you'll be sweating by the time class is finished trying to keep up with your kid!  LOL   VIP benefits if you enroll for the next season during an enrollment party.  Great discounts for the next full season, if you can pay in full during one of the enrollment parties!  Payment plans for those that need it.     For less than the cost of one family dinner out per week, your LO can have a BLAST at The Little Gym!!

This is by far one of my favorite Circle K's in the balley, if not my favorite!!  I've been going to this location for years.     I remember stopping by during my club/party days to grab a few mini airline bottles so I could have a little parking lot party (instead of paying $8 for an overpriced, half pour rum/coke) before heading into a club.  Those were the drunken days of our lives.  LOL  The store is always clean.  The fountain drinks are plentyful - lots of tasty fountain options (I always go for the caffeine free diet coke - one of the only stores I can find it on tap).    The employees are always friendly.  The "retired rock star" employee - He's just plain awesome.  From his chops to his attitude.  He remembers his customers, always has a positive attitude, and a smile on his face.  Which brings one to mine.

Rewind to Sunday September 26th, at the Arizona Bridal Affair at Chaparral Suites. J and I were only planning to go for the "Man Cave" that was to be there according to the owner of Dapper Dan's. We had a free admission flyer, so we figured, why not!?   We get there and head to the "Man Cave" but are stopped by Tracy with Salerno's Catering. We had not had lunch yet, AND more importantly, almost a month out, we had pizza planned for the rehearsal dinner. We tried the tasty Cannolies, pasta w/ meat sauce, and the Capicola, Arugula, and Provolone panini. OH MY GAWD! J was hooked after the cannoli and I was with one bit of the panini.   After the euphoria of the cannoli and panini wore off, J and I immediately started asking about pricing. We were blown away when Tracy told us that the pricing starts at $8 a person and goes up. WTF?! NO WAY!? After speaking with other establishments, I was expecting at a minimum, $20 per person. Tracy asks if we want to book a tasting, and we jump at the chance.   Jump forward to this past Tuesday night for the tasting. We arrive and are taken to our table by the owner and are asked for our beverage order , J's being coke (pepsi) and mine being water.   We started out with a salad, with the two dressings on the side for us to try. Ceaser and Italian. Both were very tasty! Next, Tracy brought out a fresh, hot bread loaf. My vice! BREAD! This bread was so good, she could have just brought me that and more butter, and I would have been in heaven.   Up next, Tracy had my favorite from the show, the paninis to try! Honey Ham and Havarti along with a Tomato, Basil, and Fresh Mozzarella panini. Both very good! The ham and havarti being my favorite of the night (with the Cap, Arugula, and Provolone being my all time fav!).   Up next, the entrees! Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Franciase, Baked Mostaccioli, and Cheese Raviolis. We were wowed by the freshness. The pasta sauce on top of the Parmagiana, Mostaccioli, and Ravioli was wonderful.   The finale was to come - Dessert. J was drooling for another cannoli and I wanted to try something else. Tracy said she'd bring out a little sampler plate with a few things. A cannoli for J, Tiramisu, and a Nuttela (Hazelnut) Brownie. All to die for!   After the bombardment of delicious food stopped, we started talking numbers. For what we wanted, $10-$12 a person. J's eyes bugged out of his head and my mouth dropped a little. The cannoli bait was cast that Sunday at the show, and we were hooked after the awesome tasting! I feel like I cant really call it a tasting. It was more like a 2 hour 4 course dinner with leftovers to take home!!    FYI - J just ate the leftover Mostaccioli yesterday, Thursday, for lunch.  He said it was amazing even a day and a half later reheated  This from a guy who HATES reheated pasta.  That's saying A LOT!  While our tummies digested, J and I sat and gabbed with Tracy about everything under the sun. Honestly, while we were there J and I felt as if we were part of their family. Tracy said that from the moment we all met at the show, she knew we'd be a fun couple and was excited to work with us. Truthfully, from the moment we walked away from their booth that Sunday, we were like kids on Christmas morning waiting to open presents (waiting for her call and for the tasting). We knew we were in for a treat! Sure enough we were!!!   We're definitely looking forward to our Rehearsal Dinner on November 5th!  :D

Salerno's did NOT disappoint for our rehearsal dinner! The food was plentiful (seriously, what E said...if you left hungry..that was your fault!!) and everyone was pleased with the quality. My favorites - The paninis and the warm bread. Hi everyone. My name is Jill and I'm a carb junkie. The staff was very friendly and helpful. While the restaurant closes at I believe 9pm, they accommodated out dinner which started at 8:30pm. I called Tracy a week or so prior to let her know that we were unfortunately down 2 people and she said that while wouldn't be able to get a refund, we'd be getting a gift certificate for the amount. THAT WORKS FOR ME!   We look forward to using that gift certificate too!  :)

When I want to hear some old school jams, stuff I was rollerskating to when I was a kid in the late 80's/early 90's, I tune into Mega 104.3!  I only wish they had a stronger signal so I could pick it up on my radio at work.  Still, I cant help but be in a good mood when I hear on my way into or from work songs like by Debbie Deb (Lookout Weekend or When I Hear Music),  Cutie Pie by One Way, or Feels Good by Toni Toni Tone!    For me, music like Mega plays can turn a horrible workday drive home into a wonderful relaxed evening at home!    Dayum, just thinking about those few songs brings a smile to my face!   :D

Fast (including delivery)!  And reasonably priced.  We've been going to Asia Lee for a few years now.  Love the fact that they deliver.  Cause well sometimes you just don't feel like leaving the house, ya know.    Oh and if your order is over $15, you can get a free (select) entree - Usually either Fried Rice or Sweet and Sour Chicken.    Generous portions = Leftovers!  :)    Though the strip mall it's located in can be perceived as dicey, its not that bad of a location.  I love the fact that they've made all of the parking in front a "No Cab Zone".

If I could pick up all of J's Rx for him (some of then you need a photo id for), I totally would have him transfer all his meds to the Scottsdale and Osborn Walgreens by my work.  This Walgreens pharmacy sucks that much!!  FIN.

We've been ordering from Rosati's for the better part of a year. Never knew this little gem was right around the corner from us.  Better than Streets (While we love garlic, streets goes a little overboard with it). 100% better than Gus'. They have a rewards program, send out coupons in the mail, offer great specials, and have coupons in the Entertainment Book!  If you love thin crust pizza, definitely check them out!

Seriously some awesome owners,  employees, and patrons here.  Dropped my bank card out in the parking lot when I was leaving tonight.  Someone found it and turned it in to the owner and they in turn gave it to the gal at the front counter.  The gal (sorry don't recall your name) I always see the who works the register and takes orders, called the house (I wasn't even home yet with our tasty pizza) to let my hubby know it was found and they were holding it for safe keeping. Thank you to the owner,  the gal,  and the honest person who found my card and turned it over. :D  For that, along with the awesome pizza, you've earned our business for a long long while. And another glowing yelp review!

Wow.  This seriously can not be the first review for this Wendy's location!?!?  Anyway....Wendy's is your traditional fast food joint.  With square hamburger patties and Frosty's.    They're pretty much all the same.    EXCEPT....I do not like a side of scabs, sores, and blistered fingers and arms with my fries.  Thank you.  Went through the drive-through to grab lunch.  Was hankering for a frosty-fry combination. It's the sweet / salty thing.    I ordered.  Drove up to the first window and paid.  Then drove to the second window to pick up my food.  I did a double take at the guys hands and arms that was manning the second window.  Some sores scabbed over.  Some looked like they were weeping.  But it was a blistered nasty mess.  Like he had his hands shoved in the fryer a week or so prior and they were healing.  VOMIT!!  I was so digusted in fact that I immediately tossed my food away when I got back to work.    Wether he touched my food or not, did not matter.  Just the pure thought of him possibly touching my food was enough to make me toss everything in the trash.   DRY HEAVE!!

I had known about the Farm, but in all my years living in the valley (I'm a Phoenix native, so there's a lot of years there ;), I had yet to go.  We had a "Mommy Day" planned (two out of the three are/were pregnant and the day consisted of breakfast, mani/pedis, and finished up with a baby shower.) which started out at MGC.    The second pregnant pal suggested we go to MGC for breakfast and everyone readily agreed.  When we arrived, our orders were taken swiftly.  I must say that they are very accommodating at MGC.  I had asked if I could order hard boiled eggs instead of scrambled/fried for my breakfast and they were more than happy to oblige my breakfast revision.    My only quibble is the fact that we were not aware that you had to pay for the self-serve beverages.  After trying/disliking the lemonade, I went back for ice tea.  Thankfully, I was only charged for one.    Can not wait to go back once MGC opens back up this fall!

I am in a semi-sugar coma while writing this review.....   Heading back to work from an AJs salad bar lunch run, I mention to my 2 colleagues, "Wanna get a free Sprinkles cupcake?" They both say sure as we pass through the light at Camelback. The driver proceeds to make a U-turn (an illegal one at that) and we head back north up Scottsdale road. Providing there had been a cop witnessing the law being broken, that free cupcake wouldn't have been free after all.   Now, I having only had Sprinkles (Red Velvet) once, my original opinion was unfavorable. I made the cardinal mistake of putting my purchased cupcake in the fridge. Big NO NO! After trying the dried out cupcake, I wondered why anyone would spend over $3.00 on a cupcake!   With the whisper word in hand, I figured why not give them another try! Its FREE after all! So my coworkers and I head inside. The smell upon entry is heavenly. We say the magic word "90210" and get our free Vanilla cupcakes.   After eating my cupcake, I have to say that the frosting was awesome! Almost a little too sweet for me, but the flavor was excellent! The cake however was a little off. It smelled and tasted of cornbread! I immediately start thinking about beans (my gram used to make cornbread and beans a lot when i was growing up, which I HATED!) and can not eat anymore. Even my coworkers said it had a cornbread taste to it. Very strange! I ate the "muffin top" and gave the rest of it away to a friend in another department who coincidentally does not like frosting. Worked out perfectly.   Will I try Sprinkles again? Most likely. But only if I can get another one free. Hopefully they'll have a whisper word for the Cinnamon Sugar one, cause it looked awesome in the case! The guy at Sprinkles said it reminds him of a churro. Sounds good to me!!   So 5 stars for FREE. 3 stars for the cake part tasting like cornbread. Averages out to 4.   PS - I think I've met my sugar quota for the day. UGH

Sprinkles, you've reached 5 stars in my book now with your creation of the German Chocolate Cupcake. My favorite cake flavor and frosting (GCC frosting is the only type I'll eat/enjoy eating.) is German Chocolate, so when I saw the notification that this flavor was debuting this month I was torn - Go and try it to either be TKO'd because its either a hit or miss.   So I went last week when they had their Eeeny Meeny secret word. I was originally going because I wanted to try the cinnamon sugar flavor. But after I walked inside and was reminded..OH YEAH they have GCC!!!...I caved to the German. I grabbed my free cupcake and headed back to work.   I had a meeting scheduled for right after lunch that day. So I decide to eat my cupcake during the meeting. Thank goodness the department/person I had the meeting with is a really good friend, cause I was dancing around while eating it. Anyone else would have thought I was off my rocker acting like a nut. But it was THAT good! I was nice enough and shared a little with my colleague. She agreed it was pretty awesome.   This cupcake is SO awesome that I mentioned it to my hubby, J, and bought him a GCC to try. GCC is also his favorite cake/frosting. So I'll get his opinion of the cupcake. I'm willing to bet he'll like it!   So 5 Stars for the GCC at Sprinkles!!   HOWEVER part of me wants to give them a big fat 1 (0 if I could give a 0)star rating, because I found out that GCC is a temporary for January. BOoOooO!!!!   Be on the lookout for a Save the Sprinkles German Chocolate Cupcake petition. lol

So I am a part of a June 2012 mommies group online.  There's a few of us that are located in Phoenix and we decided to all meet up for the first time and do a Mom's Night Out this past Friday evening.  Our original plan was to meet at Fuego, but instead we switched it to Switch.    We have a 7:30 reservation for 5 of us.  One of the mom's had something come up with her LO, so it ended up being just 4 of us.  We all arrived within minutes of each other - last one arriving at about 7:40 or so.  We're greeted and asked for our drink order - easy peasy.  That's where the decent customer service ended and turned into at best, mediocre.  Our drinks arrive and we're still looking over the menu (and chit chatting at the same time).  Our server, Angel (according to the Associate name on my receipt), came back a few times to take our dinner order...but we were still deciding on what we were going to get.  He tried to make recommendations to one of the gals, who is a picky eater, and we thought..okay..we'll get to order.  He left and didn't return to our table for at least 30 minutes.  He finally comes back and it had been so long that we had forgotten we hadn't ordered yet.    We order and our food arrives (3 of us order salads, and the other ordered a sandwich) about 15 minutes later - Time is now going on 9:00pm.  Our server disappears again for at least another 45 minutes.  He finally comes back and asks us if we want boxes.  We say no, and you'd think he'd already have the check ready.  Think again.  The time stamp on my bill states 10:07 pm.  The only good thing he did was he split the check for us based on Guests.    I had a Yelp Check-In offer, $10 off a bill of $50 or more.  Our bill after taxes was over $60.  We decided to not use the Check-In offer because we didn't want to confuse our server and end up waiting around for another 30-45 minutes.  We had tables around us come and go, but yet there we were still sitting and waiting.      We were there in total about 2 hours and 40 minutes - all for 3 salads, a sandwich, 2 glasses of wine, and an iced tea.    Friday Night Mommy Fellowship - Fantastic!  Food - Average.  Our Server Angel - Terrible!

In & Out.  If you're missing your gallbladder like I am, In & Out is appropriately named.  LOL  BUT, as a treat every now and then, I don't care.  Though, I'm sure J would love it if we went more often than not.  One of my favorite things about - Cheese paper (cheese thats stuck to the wrapper that you peel off)!!  LOL  :D    Our burgers -   Mine - Single with cheese, extra toast (on bun), add onion.  J's - Single with cheese, extra toast, add onion.          Double - Double, extra toast, add onion.   Reasonably priced food.  J says that the shakes are pretty good.  The fries - Meh.   Skip the fries!!

I've been to chompies 2x before and remember the food being decent. So this past Friday after running errands with the family, we decide to try chompies.   It was pretty empty inside. A guy comes and delivers water and then we wait. And wait. And wait. Finally about 10 minutes later our waitress comes by with straws and asks if we're ready to order.   J's order - Monte Cristo  C's order - a kids slider Mine - buffalo chicken sandwich App - Holy Pierogi  Now never having pierogis before, i can't say if these were good or not. But first impression, not ordering again.  Pretty much bland mashed potatoes in a dumping.  The Monte Cristo was greasy and very cloying. No balance of sweet and savory. Like ordering diabetes for dinner. J ended up only eating half of a half and was done. The manager did replace it with a hot pastrami, which J said was excellent and he should have ordered originally.  The kids slider - the waitress didn't ask what type of slider and C was automatically given the Jewish slider. He ate the slice of brisket off the slider and the fries.   My buffalo chicken sandwich. Not as described on the menu. A piece of grilled chicken, not fried, so huge that it was 2x the size of the bun. The chicken must have had sauce dumped over it because it was so sopping wet the bottom bun disintegrated into a mushy mess before I even took a bite. And the blue cheese was missing. I ended up eating a few bites and had had enough.   Service at the table was lack luster. Took 20 minutes to get the check. And the manager seemed irritated that we didn't like the food.   Oh and apparently dinner time is the perfect time for doing maintenance in the restroom. Going to take C to the potty, i had to ask the 2 workers to leave. Then returning later to use the facilities myself, i again had to ask them to leave. So forget trying to wash your hands properly. Unless i wanted to hopscotch over the materials/supplies.  I will say the counter/bakery guy was outstanding. His customer service - A+ Counter purchases -  Cheesecake - Fabulous. Nice texture and not overly sweet Alligator - Fantastic. If a bear claw and baklava had a baby, it would be an alligator!

Short, sweet, and to the point - I LOVE the fact that you know your feet are not sitting in a tub of who knows how many peoples toenail clippings when you go to Sundrops!    The tubs there kinda reminds me of putting your feet in the kitchen sink.  Only difference is you're not sitting on your kitchen counter, and you have someone powerbuffing your cracked heels, clippin your toenails, and giving you a wonderful foot rub!    If you have FB and like their page, you'll have access to awesome (usually daily) specials for mani/pedi combos.    I suggest booking in advance though, as its a pretty popular Arcadia Neighborhood nail spot.

Review from our cake tasting back in February. Going to try to make this short and sweet!   We live right around the corner from Let Them Eat Cake and I figured, its close, it was somewhat well reviewed, so why not!   I head in one day on my way home from work to set up an appointment. I figured that okay if this place is charging $20 for a cake tasting its gotta be good, right?! When I get home, J and I filled out the questionnaire so they can have a sample of 3 cake flavors, fillings, and frostings for us to try and I email it back.   So, fast forward to 8 weeks later (the soonest they could get us in...on a rainy Saturday morning in February). J and I arrived for the appointment about 5 minutes early. We're prompt like that, or at least I am when he's with me...HA! ;) We stood around in the Cupcake Cafe for 5 minutes before we were asked if we could be helped. We were finally escorted into the side office. There we sat and waited for the owner for a couple of minutes.   The owner arrived in a flurry and plopped down two paper plates and plastic forks with our tastings. We were then left alone for another 5 minutes. She arrived again in another flurry, plopped down the books, and left again for another 5-10 minutes. When she finally returned and sat down, she gave off an air of impatience, bragged about her awards, and made a show of the Food Network Challenge Chef's coat she was wearing. She was very brisk and business like pushing us into designing our cake and reminded us her pending appointment to immediately follow our own. Total face time with the owner - maybe 10-15 minutes.   The cake review - Here's the kicker, they combined all the flavors into a single, three layer cake. The fillings we requested sandwiched between the layers. And one frosting on the side. The cake was cold, so we guessed they had put together "our" cake a day or two in advance and left it to sit in the fridge. All the flavors melded in a way you could not judge the quality of them individually. What we could discern was sub-par and some of the worst cake we've tasted in our lives. Its one thing to charge for a tasting and quite another to rob someone of $20 for something Little Debbie can do better for only .99.   By the time we were finished, the remainder of the tasting cake seemed like a consolation prize from the worlds worst game show. We knew immediately upon exiting the building that we would not be using their services.   Okay, so I guess that review was definitely not short and certainly not sweet for the vendor!   PS - J and I made it a point to TiVo the Food Network Challenge - Anniversary Cake episode she appeared on. She and the Sedona baker she was teamed with, lost.  Surprising, I think NOT!   Let Them Eat Cake - FAIL!! FAIL!! FAIL!!!

I decided to take the owner up on her offer of a dozen free cupcakes, which she offered after reading my original review to try to entice us to give her business another chance. I called ahead of time to let them know the situation and that I would be stopping by. The lady on the phone said that I could pick the order up at anytime before the close of business.   Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted by a staff member. I then informed them that I was there to pick up the aforementioned cupcakes. Roughly a minute later, I was greeted by the owner and promptly questioned as to "whyyyy" I had posted a negative review on Yelp. She then asked why I had not called them personally to express my concerns about the cake tasting. I explained to her that Yelp is an open site, and consumers are free to share their reviews/experiences, whether they be good or bad. At which point she agreed, but still seemed displeased.   She mentioned that the bakery never charges for tastings. They merely require a deposit of $20 via a credit card. If a customer fails to show for their cake tasting appointment, the credit card is charged. I stated that it appeared to be a miscommunication by her staff, as I was led to believe that I was being charged for the tasting. On this point, I was incorrect in my original review.   She gave me the cupcakes (They were were cold. Which, I found strange) and said, "I hope you post a better review this time." To which I stated, "Well I hope we like the cupcakes." I promptly thanked her and took the cupcakes, (a random assortment chosen by the staff before my arrival) and left to go home and call my fiance to vent.   My fiance and I will most likely will not be eating all of them, but for the ones we do taste, our opinions are as follows -   Better Than Sex Cake - The fudge was tasty; a little thick, but some people like it that way. The cake itself was soggy and the flavor was somewhat flat. The caramel was a plus but could barely be tasted. I believe the caramel is the reason why the cake was soggy. The whipped cream filling and toffee pieces were a delicious accent. Very messy.   Little Deb - The fudge frosting was good, but again too thick. The whipped cream filling again was delicious. The cake was dry and again somewhat flat.   Plain Jane - The cake was dry, however the cream filling was delicious.   Plain Jack - The cake was moist and the filling was tasty. Out of all of them, I think we liked this the best.   Oreo - The cake was pretty moist. The whipped cream filling was again a hit. The more you eat the frosting, the more the Oreo flavor comes through.   Cosmos - The cake was dry. Raspberry filling was decent, very tart. The coconut was a nice touch. The frosting was overly sweet.   Boston Cream - Pretty good. And I'm not a big fan of cream style pies. The cake was very moist.   Spumoni - The pistachio Bavarian cream filling was more like a pudding. The green color threw me at first, but i overcame my fear of snot colored food and sampled some. The cake was moist.   Cake of the Month - PB&J. The peanut butter frosting, terrible. The cake was moist and there was actual grape jelly inside. That flavor combo was not bad. If they could have actually used peanut butter, instead of the peanut butter frosting, it would have probably been better together.   Now that we've OD'd on sugar, we can safely say that the cake was overall dry. The frostings were neither a hit nor a miss. The whipped filling was the star of the cupcake. Its safe to say that if we're in the mood for cupcakes, I'll save myself the money and make them myself at home.   4 Stars for the cupcakes being free  2 Stars for the cupcakes being overall nothing to write home about.  Going with 2 stars (If I could give a 1/2 a star here, i would rate it 2.5)

We went here yesterday as J and I were both in the mood for Greek.  We each got the Gyro Combo.  Mine with the Greek Salad.  J's with the seasoned fries.    The gyro meat was not over-seasoned, which was a good thing.  And tzatziki sauce was not overly cucumbery.  My salad though was over dressed and had WAY too much feta cheese on it.    But all in all - the food was good.  I think we'll be back.

After reading all the rave reviews and seeing Over Easy on Food Network's DDD, I was eager to check this place out.  I decided that Mother's Day with my grandparents and mother would be a perfect day to do so.  I made sure we got there early enough to avoid the crowd.  There were about 6 empty tables (not busy at all) and we got sat immediately.  Unfortunately, we sat there for about 20 minutes while all the waitstaff completely ignored us. Had to finally ask a busboy to find out who our server is. He said he wasn't sure. The lady who sat us said to the busboy she didn't know who was our server either (not sure if she was the co-owner or manager or whatnot). She had to practically beg for someone to take the table. Its a SMALL place, so I heard the lady loud and clear. I got up and left after that, taking my family with me. Over Easy = Over FAIL!

We went to Vegas over the holiday weekend and knew I wanted to stop at the Outlet mall.  Specifically, the Coach Outlet store.  Well, I scored big time that weekend ~ 30% off everything, PLUS 40% off clearance.  HELLO!  J told me to pace myself.  LOL  Like he's one to talk (ahem..Fossil..cough..).   I walked in with a signature bag (which was still under warrenty), and walked out with my new bag and wallet.  Left the bag I came in with to get repaired.  Which by the way costs only $20.    Love my new bag and wallet!!  And my bank account loves me for getting 30% plus an additional 40% (both the bag and wallet were clearance items).    Thank goodness there is not a Coach Outlet store in Arizona.  However, that is soon going to change as I was told by the cashier there is one coming to the Anthem Outlets.  Not too sure how I feel about that yet.  LOL

This Walmart is in my "hood" and I will seriously only shop here if I'm desperate and can not wait until Frys or Target opens.    Dirty store - Check Wait 30 minutes in line to check out - Check Need to "hire" someone to do some work for you - Check ( a quick scan of the parking lot, and you'll find your workers ) Some woman smoking "something" in a bathroom stall - Check   ( "security" proceeded to kick her out of the store within minutes of someone narcing on her.  I was standing in the customer service line waiting to get a refund when everything went down.  You could her her yelling from outside the bathroom. )  I will drive my happy azz 8 miles to Mesa Riverview's Walmart than drive the 1.5 miles to this location.

In short -   Terrible wait staff. Water that tasted like watered down sprite.   Overpriced what is essence fried rice with a little protein.   Disgusting bathrooms.    We sat at a tepan table and was immediately moved to another in the corner of the restaurant.  There was a family of 4 sitting there.  2 adults - 2 kids both under 2yrs old.  We saw that the other family had already ordered sushi and it looked decent, so we decided to order 2 rolls our self to nosh on while we waited for our tepan food.  WELL....we were informed that if we wanted sushi before our meal, we'd have to move to yet another table since that family had been waiting for a while.  I inform the server that we'll stay at the table and still order sushi.  The miso that is brought out is broth with 2 slices of mushroom.  The salad was terrible.  We order our tepan food and wait 30minutes before a chef comes to our table.  The family said they were waiting 20minutes before their order was taken and had been without a chef for an hour.  The restaurant was not that busy.  Though the main course was decent....it's overpriced.  Oh and that sushi we ordered...didnt come until AFTER we were ready for the check.   Apparently there's another tepan restaurant further west according to my brother.  Next time we're having my mom babysit and are in the mood for tepan, we'll keep driving.

One of the things I love most about birthdays - Free Meals!!  I received via email (join their PIG Email Club) a screamin coupon deal (free entree with entree purchase of equal or greater value, up to $15) for J's birthday.  Score!  Moved to the bar area, due to it being too hot where we were originally seated (right next to the to-go area).  Service in both areas was good.   Everything that came to the table -   Chips - Its a chip mystery.  Greasy, but somehow still crisp.  We would have preferred a bowl of pickle chips instead prior to our meal.   Speaking of the pickle chips - COSTCO sells them!  :D  After all the chips are gone, keep the brine!  I'll make some hard boiled eggs and pickle them in the brine.  J loves them!  Texas Manhandler - According to J - "It was tasty.  The Brisket was tender, juicy and succulent.  The sausage had the right amount of snap and was well seasoned.  The addition of the Firecracker Pickles added a sweet and spicy dimension that made it an overall, highly enjoyable sandwich on some of the softest, yet robust buns.  With a little Devil's Spit BBQ Sauce, it is a must eat for the Carnivores out there."  Thanks J!  ;D  Southside Rib Tips - Huge portion! Tips were nice and meaty.  Cooked to perfection - Very tender.   Ear Corn - Not "sweet corn" but field corn (as Papa would call it). I think its boiled in sugar water to give it a slightly sweet taste.   Famous Fries - Nice thick cut steak/wedge style fries.  Lightly salted. Skip dipping in catsup!  But if you're a dipper, use the bbq sauces.   Drunkin' Apples - LOVE! Thank gawd somewhere else other than Cracker B. makes these.   Jalapeno Mac & Cheese - Awesomeeeeee!  Creamy with just a hint of a bite from the diced Jalapenos.  The corn provides a sweet and textural counterpoint to the pasta and cheese.  Corn Muffins - LOVE!  It reminds me of my own cornbread.  And I hate to say it , but they're better than mine.  If I can hold out, I usually save mine and eat it for breakfast the next morning. They have little muffin cups so you can take yours home.  :)  Famous Sundae - This was free and a surprise (because of J's birthday) The vanilla bean ice cream was not cloying. Ours was drizzled with delicious hot fudge and topped with whipped cream.  The whipped cream was a little much though.  If I would have known they were bringing it out, I would have asked them to go easy with the whip.   The portions they give you with the dinners are huge.  My leftovers (rib tips) lasted me for 2 days.  Ask for an extra muffin cup and take home some sauce for your leftovers.

This place is my go-to for meat I'm throwing in a crockpot (usually pork shoulder/butt)!  $1.79 (approx) per lb for boneless pork shoulder.  Yes, please!    Closer than driving to Phoenix Ranch off 16th and a lot quicker to get in and out of.    Lots of Asian items - from rice noodles (dried or in the fridge) to fresh vegetables.   I occasionally make a stop here for fortune cookies - J likes them, a lot!  So until I decide to try my hand at making them myself, Super L is where I get them from.  :)

J and I wanted to take my grandparents out to dinner Saturday night, as a thanks for all they have done to help us with the wedding planning. I give J the task on figuring out where to go, and he suggests Logan's or Cracker Barrel. I think, OOH there's a Famous Dave's there and Papa LOVES bbq. So, I throw that idea out there as well. But since the g-rents also like "southern home cookin", we went to Cracker Barrel.   We arrive to find no host at the station and end up standing around for about 5 minutes with no one in sight. Finally, what looks like a manager, comes by and says....Someone will be with you shortly. Wow, really? Finally, the host arrives to his station, and we are escorted to a table.   We wait for our server to come by the table. 10 minutes or so and still no server. Finally another server stops and asks us if we've been helped. J replies firmly, "No, we have not!" The server asks us for our drink order and comes back a few minutes later with our beverages. He says that "our server" was complaining about another table, or was complaining about another table complaining, so he was going to take our table. Okay, cool cause we're hungry.   J orders the Meatloaf. I get the Chicken Fried Chicken with the gravy on the side. Grams orders the Grilled Chicken Tenders Dinner. And Papa orders the BBQ sandwich. We distract ourselves for the moment with that puzzle game while we wait for our biscuits and cornbread, which finally arrived with our meal.   Grams dinner - She said everything tasted fine.  Papa's dinner - His bbq sandwich was according to him (he does NOT hold back when it comes to his opinions, especially food) dry, stringy, tough, and under seasoned. I asked our server for a side of bbq sauce so he could eat.  My dinner - The only thing decent was the Okra and the Apples. The Mac and Cheese had what looked like black plastic in it. After I got done picking it out and putting it on the side of my plate, it looked to be about 1/3 c of the black crap. I told J, "What the hell is this!?"  J's dinner - The meatloaf was bone dry. The mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. Literally, the gravy was congealed.   J was fed up, and he got up to seek out a manager. The manager came back and was combative with him. He said, the black stuff was cheese. REALLY?! Since when is cheese the consistency of melted plastic and black in color?! He offered to have our meals replaced. A few minutes later, our dinners come out. J says that it looks much better. I pick through the Mac and Cheese and find no black crap. Alright!! Let's chow! Not even 30seconds later, J's sitting there staring at his mashed potato loaded fork in front of his face. I look over and immediately start laughing. Its a HAIR! You've got to be kidding!   The server comes by a few seconds later and says, "How's everything..." and stops mid sentence. He sees J staring at something on the fork. "Oh no, that's not good" our server says. He goes off to get the manager. I cant stop laughing.  I cut into my chicken, and without looking take a bite. Hmmm, something was off. I look down and yeah, that's not chicken fried chicken. Its chicken fried steak, which I LOATHE. I just think tenderized meat tastes like its already been chewed.   The manager comes by and apologizes for everything and says our dinner's are free (including my grandparents). You're Dayumn'ed right they better be free!! We do leave our server a tip, since the quality of our dinner was not in anyway his fault.   Papa, without missing a beat says, "Well Lorraine, you want to come back and try breakfast here tomorrow?" Grams says, "Yeah, I don't think so."   In a nutshell, we shoulda gone to Famous Daves.

Red Robin...Yummmmm!!  From the endless fries option (which J and I never take advantage of) to ordering off menu and getting a custom burger, Red Robin is awesome.    There isn't a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on the menu.  Sad.  Very Sad.  HOWEVER, the waiter/waitress does magic for the ticket and I always end up with a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich in front of me!  YAY!!  If you don't have one already, be sure to get a Red Loyalty card.  With the registering of this card, you can get a free burger for your birthday!  Gotta love free stuff!  :)

Went to DM a few weeks ago with my mom.  I was kinda of excited...I mean...a WHOLE STORE dedicated to the preggos!?!  Where can you go wrong?  I'll tell you where you can go wrong....if you're a plus size preggo.  Forget it.  For being a plus size gal, I'm very proportionate.  And all of my weight has shifted.  Where there wasn't much of a tummy before with a small waist....HELLO BABY BUMP!    This stores Plus Size section is a joke.  Here's a rack about 5ft long, in total, for you to find clothes from.  And forget about them being cute.   I should have known MY clothes selection would be anorexic especially seeing the location - N. Scottsdale(haha...that was kinda funny...anorexic...n.scottsdale....teehee).    Anywho.  Can you say - Catering to the demographics??  All together now....  The only positive thing to come about was Edamame Spa  - The spa place tucked in the corner.  Found out lots of information on what to use on my skin and about getting prenatal massages.

I cant believe we've been to The Keg (this location actually) at least 3 times, and I've never reviewed it!    We took our friend Ben to dinner here this past Friday night, as a thank you for all he's done for us in preparation of the birth of our son.  7pm on a Friday night and we were seated immediately.  The irony of our table location was, our server was also pregnant!!  LOL    Great service.  Great food.  Can't wait to go back again!

This MIchael's sucks!  We were there Friday night to get a few craft items for the baby's room.  I also needed some items to make my baby shower favors with.    It was pretty busy when we got there.  BUT was there a team member around to answer questions?  NOPE!  2 workers were in the store...TOTAL....from what we saw.    After trying to figure and locate eveything on our own...with no luck.  J and I dropped all the items we had and left.    We should have just made the drive to JoAnn's in scottsdale.

Miss Ebony treated me to a little mini Spa day at the Hawaiian Experience Spa this past Saturday - A massage and facial.    I had my massage first, with Jared.  A majority of the knots in my right shoulder (my problem shoulder) were worked out and I walked out of the room feeling like someone had just shot me with a tranq dart.  LOL    My facial was decent.  I have to say though, I've had better at the school.  I asked for extractions, as my nose is a warzone for blackheads at times.  TMI?  Lol   Anyhow, she barely did any extractions.  I ended up cleaning up my nose myself the next day at home.  Will I return?  Probably not for a facial.

Went here after I was told they sold wrapping paper from a gal at Pier 1 at Tempe Marketplace. I needed a few rolls with a Damask design for my wedding cake baker. She's making cupcake holders out of them!   Upon entering the establishment, I was blasted in the face/lungs with the smell of plastic. Which is to be expected when going into a store of this kind. I was impressed with the overall selection of containers. From little itty bitty (coin size) to huge Rubbermaid!  The wrapping paper selection is less than to be desired, though they do have a whole isle dedicated to gift wrapping. Then again, I might be biased because I did not find what I needed.   They also have a section for garment bags and the like. I had planned on buying one for my wedding dress and a nice satin coat hanger. Alas, the overwhelming smell of plastic consumed me and my lungs and I had to immediately leave up having an allergy/asthma attack.   Though I'd love to visit again and get the garment bag and nice coat hanger I had in hand, my lungs forbid me! :(

Preface - We stayed at Club 36 over Labor Day weekend as part of a vacation club sales package via Bass Pro.   The Good -   (See The Bad #2)  Maintenance was quick to remedy all problems in a timely manner.    The Bad -   1) Upon booking 3 months prior, I had reserved a Handicapped Suite. With a HC room, we wouldn't need to bring a shower bench/chair. 4 weeks prior to arrival, I call to see about extending our stay by a day. I again get confirmation that we have a HC suite. 1 week prior to arrival, I verify that we do have a HC suite booked for our reservation. Now, upon arrival, we are given a non-HC room. FAIL! They luckily had a HC suite available. If they hadn't, we would have had a serious problem.    2) The bathroom had major water issues. The toilet wouldn't flush. And the big one - The shower basin had no lip to keep the water from flooding into the rest of the tile floored bathroom. Not good when one of you is missing a leg and the other just had knee surgery.   The Ugly -   Our presentation was scheduled at 9:00 am the morning after check-in.    The presentation is rapid-fire, and given at a dizzying pace. They state that they will only take 90-120 minutes, but don't even get through with the property tour until 180 minutes in. Questions are deferred as long as possible in the hopes that you'll forget.  The answers to any questions you do remember are presented as special information that you can only get as an owner. The entire format is war of attrition between them and your willpower; sapping you of Blood-sugar, energy, and focus, by rapidly firing off information.   The entire thing seems gauged to get you as off-balance as possible, with an impending sense of urgency, making one reach for the checkbook, as opposed to the centers of reason in the human brain.  They are supposed to show you, and allow you to read,  (Per Nevada State Law) the documents with ALL the property offerings in the form of the Public Offering Statement, PRIOR TO SIGNING.  That they did not.  They even misrepresented a document as the Public Offering Statement, which was not discovered until later on that evening.    Critical thinking is the enemy of the Bluegreen presentation.   For those who are considering purchasing, be sure to request "private time" to review the program rules and procedures.  DO NOT TAKE WHAT THE SALESPERSON SAYS AT FACE VALUE.  Weigh and consider the Resort point charges per night and the RCI program outlined in the first few sections of the large Resort Binder.    The sales pitch you are given, stating that you will be able to vacation free for the rest of your life, is a bunch of BS.  Doing some serious investigative work once we returned home, I discovered (via disclosure from one of the BG reps through whom you would normally book your vacation) the conversion value is 5000 points = about $200.00  I'm sorry but spending $28K for 20,000 points a year at that conversion rate (when we were told our BG vacations would be free) is not a good deal to me.  It's more like a RIP OFF!    If you do sign and have second thoughts, make sure you follow the current rescission instructions TO THE LETTER.    At present, Nevada State Law only gives you 5 DAYS to send in the rescission notice.  It must be sent to the corporate offices in Boca Raton, FL.  Overnight the paperwork along with ALL materials (Bluegreen and RCI books) given, with receipt return confirmation.  Make copies of everything you mail to the corporate offices.  I went as far as to having both the rescission paper and my own personal rescission letter (which included the date of signing, our contract #, etc) notarized.   As of 9/12/11: In Nevada, the purchaser of a timeshare may cancel, by written notice, the contract of sale until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date of EXECUTION of the contract. The contract of sale  MUST  include a statement of this right. The notice of cancellation may be delivered personally to the developer or sent by certified mail or telegraph to the business address of the developer.  The developer shall, within 15 days after receipt of the notice of cancellation, return all payments made by the purchaser.   Today, 9/28/11, makes day 15, and upon checking my bank account, I see that the credit was made to my account, less $75 for the materials (the vacation books).  The $75 we were told would be credited after we return the materials, which they received on 9/28/11.      Update - 12/28/11 - Still waiting for my $75 to be refunded from the BG Vegas Sales Center.

This place is AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!  About twice the size of a regular Costco.  With some products you wont find at your regular Costco.  From beef primals to jelly roll sheets and other various kitchen items - This place caters to the business/restaurant owner.  J about lost it when he saw the sold Rockstar Energy Drinks, by the case.  Averaging about $1 a can, if on mailer coupon special.    I'm sure we'll be back to this location!  :)

I have been going to Belle Melange Salon since March 6 of this year.  I remember the date only cause J and I had a cake tasting right around the corner and I came into the salon bearing gifts (10 cupcakes from the tasting).  That and it was the day before my girl E's birthday.  E ended up with the cupcakes.  LOL  I first learned about Belle from fellow reviewer and my MOH, Ebony K!  And if anyone knows the salon/hair care industry, its E!  So, when she stated she had a hair appointment that saturday, I jumped at the chance to get my own appointment at the same time.  I too as another reviewer stated, have a tragic history with hair salons (last relaxer done in 2000, which ended in a chemical hair cut...my hair was fried!  I was traumatized.  My hair went from the middle of my back to 2 inches long), so I was glad E was there too.    J was dropping me off and E was running late.  Call me a scardy cat, but I DID NOT want to go in without E.  I call up E and she tells me everyone there is wonderful and friendly and to go in.  I put on my big girl panties and get out of J's car and head inside.    I walk in and the salon is incredibly nice looking.  I am greeted and have a seat while I wait for my stylist, Jessica.  In the end, my hair turned out wonderful (I walked out with it still on my head!) and I was very pleased!  I knew I'd return.    Fast forward to this past Friday.  I have been going every month to get my hair styled and in shape (cut/condition), and to ultimately have my hair done for my wedding in November.  I usually get a call the day before to confirm my appointment, but I didnt get one this time.  So I called them.  Turns out, my stylist was no longer working there and it had been a mere oversight with calling me to inform me.  Okay, no worries.  But EEK at my stylist being gone (I was bringing in my veil and wedding jacket so we could get an idea on styles that would work).   Thankfully, everyone there at the salon are awesome stylists.  I was able to book with Deja, so I did.  My hair turned out EVEN better with Deja doing it!  After she finished, we talked about styles for the wedding.  I put on my jacket and she said...I think I know what I'm going to do.  AWESOME!    In a sense, it was fate that my old stylist left (she didnt have a clue for my day of style) and I was able to rebook with Deja.  She has a game plan for a few styles we are going to do for my Trial Run.  I'm excited to see what my hair looks like for the wedding!    In the end, if I'm trusting someone to do my hair for an important day like my wedding, they've GOT to be good!  Deja is and I couldn't be happier to be working with her!

I can not say enough positive things about Belle Melange Salon and the outcome of my wedding day hairstyle.  My hair looked amazing (Photos linked to business)!!  As a matter of fact, ALL my bridesmaids hairstyles looked amazing!!  I received a card from the owner, Shaunte, a few days ago thanking me for allowing them to take part in my wedding day beauty plans.    Cost for wedding trial and day of style - $100.00 (not including tip)  It doesn't get any better than that ladies!!  :)  So if you're looking for a salon for your wedding hairstyle, or heck just a salon (its multi-cultural) to go to in general....go visit Shaunte and the crew at BELLE!

This place was awesome!!  Went for the first time this morning for breakfast.  Had the Straight Shooter breakfast (2 eggs, pancakes, sausage, and fruit).    Daily dose is very accommodating!!  I'm pregnant and was craving one of my favorite things - Peanut Butter and Jelly Pancakes.  No butter.  No syrup.  Just peanut butter and jelly.  Asked what type of fruit they had, and they said it was a mixture of watermelon, grapes, and pineapple.  I asked if I could 86 the watermelon and get more pineapple - Wasn't a problem for them at all!  I got my eggs over easy.  They were a little on the runny side, which I didn't care for that much.  The sausage was tasty.  The pancakes though, awesome!  Buttermilk.  Nice and fluffy and pretty big.     Full tummy = Happy Mommy and Baby :)   I shall return to Daily Dose!

Now I've only gone to D.D for breakfast prior to this past Saturday.  I try to stay as far away from the area I work on the weekends.  LOL  With gelato calling my name, us still needing dinner, and wanting a burger than Thai food Saturday night...I suggested D.D.    We arrive and its pretty empty inside with one party of 8 seated a few tables over.  We sit down and wait about 5+ minutes for someone to come take a drink order (though someone had been around with water a minute after we sat down). A few minutes longer and J said he would have wanted to leave.    The water you get is cucumber water, with a slice of cucumber in it.  I didn't mind, but J thought it was terrible.   The gal comes by and we order our beverages and decide on an app because they were on happy hour special.    The Chicken Pouches are very tasty!!! J especially liked the sesame orange and balsamic reduction sauce.  He's not a huge fan of wontons, but he liked these.    We both ordered burgers with the combo fries (sweet potato and crispy) -  Mine - DD Burger w. bacon on the side  J - Gladiator.   These burgers were huge!!!  The bacon was especially tasty and I ate it separate from my burger.  J ate about 3/4 of the burger and said he was stuffed.  But said that the burger was good.  Portion sizes were generous.  And he would suggest it to his coworkers for one of their Friday lunch outings.    Will I be back?  Silly question!   Breakfast or Lunch/Dinner..this place is a winner!

Welcome to the festival de meat!   J and I went to Fogo for the first time to celebrate our anniversary back in April. I called the day prior to see if we could do reservations and how much time we would need to enjoy the experience that is Fogo.   The woman I spoke with was very courteous, informative, and asked if we were celebrating anything special. I told her it was our anniversary and had to be at the theater in downtown phoenix at 7:30pm.  She stated that about an hour and a half would be a sufficient amount of time.  So, we set our reservations for 5:30pm.   We arrive a little prior to 5:30 and were quickly escorted to our table in the back of the house (they said so we could enjoy our dining experience as it is nosier in the front the later it gets). I noticed that we were probably overdressed, (J in a suit and myself in a cocktail dress. We saw patrons in shorts/jeans/tennis shoes) but we did not care.   We were seated and instructed on how the dining experience works (and to stick mostly with the meat and skip the salad bar all together if we wanted) with the red/green card. No sooner than getting back to the table from the salad bar, we're approached by a gaucho chef to start table-side service. Our cards were still red! We said as soon as we're ready, we'll flip the cards over.   Green = GO team FOGO! No sooner than turning the card over, gauchos were coming at us from all directions! It felt like we were under a siege of meat! I think that all the waitstaff works together, and no one has a designated section. We had at least 3 different people come and refill our drinks at the blink of an eye (the glasses weren't even close to being half empty most of the time). Though, I was in a meat coma and could not eat another bite, our dinner ended with a complementary dessert.  J got to enjoy the Flan almost all to himself.  :)  Our bill came to exactly $100.00 before tip.  That included 1 drink for J and an ice tea for myself.    The entire staff, from manager down to the hostess, made us feel welcomed for our first Fogo de Chao experience. The food, service and ambiance were very enjoyable. We look forward to experiencing Fogo again soon!!

There was no doubt where I was going to take J for his Father's Day dinner/lunch.  FOGO it was going to be!  I did however have a little hesitation on taking Baby C along with us.  Would they have high chairs?  Never saw any babies/toddlers there in our visits there.  Baby C can be a pretty messy eater, with a good portion of his food ending up on the floor.  And, while Baby C is pretty well behaved, he is now known to start testing his vocal cords out - chattering very loudly and screaming with excitement.  I was reassured when I made my reservations, that they did in fact have highchairs (30 in fact), not to worry about any mess Baby C would make, that there would be plenty of kids there, and it would be pretty loud.    Mother's Day and Father's Day - who leaves their kids with a babysitter anyway?!  I tell you what, I am glad I made a reservation for us and indicated we would need a high chair, because there was apparently a wait - On High Chairs!!    Our service was kinda so-so, but I attribute that to the fact that there were a TON of families there (we had a 2:30 reservation).  So many people in fact that I believe they ran out of meat, as we were waiting for quite a bit for a gaucho to come by wielding his sword of meat.   My favorite - The Lamb..hands down.  Baby C's favorite too!!

J and I went to this Paradise location while we were out last night.  He'd never been to a Paraside before.  Since it was after 6pm, the OldTown Scottsdale location was closed.  But, since we had to go out to Mesa, he reminded me of the Tempe Marketplace location.    With such a busy location, you'd think that the restaurant would be clean.  Nope.  Trash on the floors.  Dirty tables.  We had to walk around for a minute before we found a clean empty table.  J was so put off by the dirty tables surrounding ours that he got up and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager, from what J stated, was like...Yeahhhhhhhhhh..I know.  He knows his employees are doing a half assed job on keeping the dining area clean and isnt doing anything about it to make sure its clean ALL THE TIME?!  Now to the food.    We split a Paradise Club.  It seemed as if this sandwich was just thrown together.  Very dry.  J was not at all impressed.    I had a cup of Mac & Cheese and J had a bowl of Mac & Cheese.   Im guessing since the mac & cheese is in individual packages, they cook them in a sous vide.   J's came from a batch that had not been cooked yet.  The guy says, this ones cold, so I have to heat it up.  He then throws the cup in the microwave.  Uhhh..okay.  J said his was alright.  He had a little left over and gave me the rest of his.  Why did the mac taste chewy.  Like it had not been cooked all the way?  Though seeing the bowl being put in the microwave, I should have known something would have been off.  But I was not expecting chewy macaroni.    After everything was said and done, I wish the OldTown Scottsdale would have been open!  Because I unfortunately don't think I'll be able to get J to step foot in another Paradise after this experience.

My fiance and I are having our November wedding/reception at the Windermere.   Since money IS of an object, I shopped around for the best bang for our buck for vendors. Not only did Windermere beat out all of the other locations I priced, but the catering staff has been extremely helpful throughout all the planning. Joe is an absolute delight to work with!   Looking forward to our Nuptials in November!!

The catering staff at Windemere went above and beyond for my wedding day - November 6th 2010!  All requests I made were fulfulled!  Just to name a few - chair covers for the ceremony, doing away with the ice sculpture (which we got a credit for), adding an additional table for the ceremony, arranging for us to be able to keep the bridal dressing suite for as long as we needed, and issuing drink tickets for the bridal party.     Everything was timed out and went according to schedule (Which every bride/groom should have coordinated ahead of time with the DJ and then the DJ sends the timeline to the venue. That's what our DJ did.) which is a good thing because we were on a strict timeline! We left for our honeymoon immediately following the reception.   From what everyone has told me, the food (BUFFET STYLE - Prime Rib and Lemon Herb Chicken) was fantastic. I now know that the saying is true, the bride and groom will not really get a chance to eat on their wedding day. But what I did have a chance to taste (had 2 mini quiches, and a few bites of the lemon herb chicken) was yummy as hell!   Kinda makes me wish that J and I woulda told everyone to stop coming up to our table and stop ringing the kissy bells and let us eat for 5 minutes. LOL   From what I remember of the day, its all a blur now (LOL), everything was fantastic!  Also makes me wish I could do my wedding day all over again! :)    THANKS to Joe V. and the rest of the catering staff at Windemere!!

Was included in the baby consignment listings when doing a search on yelp (app and mobile).  I certainly do not consider 1 rack maybe 4-5 foot long of baby clothes a place I want to even bother going to in search of baby items (unless maybe I'm looking for vintage baby clothes). Also, way overpriced if you ask me.   However, if you're looking for vintage clothes/shoes/etc... This is a decent place to start..kinda. Though when I was full on in my rockabilly phase, there were far better places to go in search of clothes (A Goodwill store being the first stop).   On another note, the gal working when we went in the other day seemed more interested in playing with her phone than engaging us, her potential customers.

I frequent this post office during my work hours (or if I'm on my way to or from work).  If I'm mailing packages and I'm around home, I go to the main post office on Van Buren.    Anywho - Just stopped by here Monday and yesterday (Tuesday) to pick up a priority box and mail off my package.    When I grabbed the box, no where on the box did it say that it was not the flat rate shipping box.  That's what I thought I was picking up.  So instead of paying $12.xx for shipping, I ended up paying $17.xx.    So really, that's my only gripe.  Have the shipping box area labeled accordingly, that way people know what type of boxes they're grabbing.

Walked in...was able to order the lunch special...got our miso soup and the bowls the soup were in were completely filthy. Gunk crusted on the outside of both of our bowls. We told the sever and he made excuses. We canceled our order and left. Oh and this place doesn't know what air conditioning is apparently.

In less than 1 week (Friday and then Monday), 2 of my favorite pairs of shoes decided to break on me. Not 1, but 2!! And both while I was at work. After my favorite pair (NYC circa 2000) broke Monday, I was ready to throw both pair away. My love for shoes got the best of me and I started Yelping for shoe repair shops in the area. That's when I discovered Tony's (which happens to be 1 block from my work)!   So, I drop off both pairs of shoes Monday after work. The gentleman says, "Does Wednesday work for you?" I'm thinking to myself...are you kidding?! Less than 2 days?! I said, "Wednesday is fantastic!"   Now, I was a little worried that my NYC pair would not be able to be fixed, due to how it broke. But Wednesday, I head back and there are both pair's fixed!! The gentleman said that the shoe had to have a brace put in, but that its wearable now. Come to find out, they restructured both shoes so the other one wouldn't break on me down the road. 10 years, that's a lot of wear!   Total cost - $38.00 :) Not too shabby!   Thank you Tony's and here's to 10 more years of wearing my NYC pair!

Pete's has been in my life since I was a little girl.  I can remember going to the original location on Van Buren with my grandparents.  All of the locations look less than to be desired from the outside, but there's treasures to be found within the menu.    My staple used to be the 5 or 7 piece shrimp and chips.  Gotta get extra sauce.   While I still love the shrimp and chips, I've discovered a new front runner, thanks to my hubby J.    He's lived here since he was 5 years old and had never been to a Pete's.  2 weeks ago this past Sunday, I had a preggo craving for some fried tasty goodness.  I directed J to the online Pete's menu and he figured he'd give Pete's a try.    My order - 7 piece shrimp and chips with extra 14oz Pete's Sauce.  $6.10 J's order - Triple Everything Monsterburger.  Large chips.  $7.00 I looked at J and said...uhh...are you sure you want a burger?  He said yep.    I dont know, something about ordering a burger from Pete's always kinda weirded me out.  But I figured...it's his gut.  So be it.   I go and order through the drive-through.  A few minutes later, I get our order and drive back home.    OMG!  This burger was freaking HUGE and looked AWESOME!!  J took his first few bites and I inquired as to how it tasted.  He raved about this burger.   It was so big though that he couldn't finish all of it.  That's saying a lot cause J can eat!    Flash forward to this past Monday.  I was craving a good burger on the cheap.  J suggested Pete's.  I about fell on the floor!  This burger must have been something else!    Well, let me tell you ~ The hell with the seafood!  Order a burger, people!!!  After ordering my own Monster Everything Burger, I know where my go to burger joint is going to be from now on!!

Fast.  Friendly.  On Time.    When our front loading washing machine stopped spinning, (3 years old and was our first front loader) I thought..."Great.  Just what we need. Another thing to break down this week."  The technician who showed up showed for the appointment was very informative and let  J watch/showed him how to take off the back panel of the washer to check the belts.    Come to find out, the washer was just off balance.  DOH!  Regular washers I've had in the past usually made a buzzing noise when they were off balance.  It was a $106 lesson learned.  But we felt that the price was right for the amount of time he took and how informative he was.    That price included the service call, diagnostics, and 30 minutes labor.  Which according to the guy I spoke with when I called to make the appointment, is usually all the time that's needed.   Would we use Dino's again?  You bet!   Here's hoping its not anytime soon though!  :)

Oh Dutch Bros, why have I not tried you sooner!?!?  Great customer service. Tasty beverages! A little on the pricey side, but a treat of an iced chai and a non dairy fruit kiddy smoothie for Little C every once in a while isn't going to break the bank!  Oh yes, I will return!! :)

I've been to Clean Freak 3 times in the last week.  Got all 3 of our vehicles washed.  First wash I got the $12 wash for the SUV.  I ended up getting a free $5 wash.  So when you think about it....that's 2 washes for $12 (1 premium wash and 1 basic...not too shabby if you ask me).  I took J's car to get washed with the free wash Tuesday and then took my 16 year old truck for a $5 wash last night.  The old boy looked great after wards!    I have to admit, I like this wash better than the one around the corner, though they towel dry your vehicle.  I'd rather come to Clean Freak just for the pure fact that for the same price, you can get to vacuum out your vehicle, can air blast off excess water (which there will after going through the dryers), and you get a detail towel to wipe down your dash.    Bring a towel with you to dry off your vehicle when you're in the vacuum area.    Seriously considering getting the monthly pass, because I cant help but hold my head up a little higher driving a nice clean vehicle!  :)

Now, I'll tell you I was a little skeptical.  A place that serves Mexican food and diner food.  Come on, now.  But, I had a 2 4 1 entree coupon via my new entertainment book, so a colleague and I decided to give Davids a try.  And what a cute little 50s style diner it is!  :)  We called in our order and walk over.  When we get there, we let the guy (maybe it's David himself) know that we phoned in our order.  And a minute later he brings out our Davids burger.    Tasty burger.  Handmade burger I believe.  It was falling apart on us.  All in all, fast and friendly service.  Decent eats.  We'll be back !  :)

This store is fantastic!  To compare it...its like Goodwills wealthy cousin.  The same stuff, but nicer quality - top of the line brands...for almost the same price!  Housewares, luggage, furniture, clothing, and accessories.   I was in a shoppers paradise. A Coach Wallet, almost brand new, and 2 dresses with tags still on them - Total shopping spree cost $45.00.  That price was almost $77 though. I was half tempted to buy an additional Xmas gift the family member I drew this year - A gently used Juicy Couture purse for $32.    When baby time comes for J and I, I know where I'm heading for baby furniture and clothes!  I will definitely be heading back to Smarty Pants!  :)

Thanks to 2-4-1 coupons handed out by my employer, I went here for the first time a few weeks back.  I was expecting this place similar to ColdStone.  You tell them what you want, and they make it for you.  Not YogurtLand.  Self-control is the name of the game here cause you make your tasty treat yourself!  My coworker and I walk in and are handed sample cups.  Big mistake for a pregnant woman.  I wanted to try every flavor!  I resisted though.  ;)  LOL   My taste buds are leaning lately more towards savory/sour than sweet, so I ended up getting a small amount of Blackberry Lemon Mint with a spoonful total of toppings.  My cup hardly weighed anything!    Total spent - $4 for the 2 of us.   Thanks to my employer for obtaining the 2-4-1 coupon and thanks Yogurtland for the tasty yogurt!!  :D

I received 2 Massage Envy gift cards last year, but had not used them yet. So when my shoulder pain flared up, and I couldn't get in to see my chiropractor, I decided to cash in the gift cards and get a massage...which turned into using the gift cards towards a 6 month membership.   Dennis has been my therapist since the beginning. Whether I'm getting a regular massage or a sports massage (for the shoulder), the next day I am usually in little to no pain.   My membership is up for renewal next month, and I'm pretty sure I'm probably going to buy another one. Everyone should treat themselves to a massage a month.

Had to return a pair of jeans to this store last Friday.  Got the wrong size from the AM Mills location.  DOH!  The AZ Mills manager called up the TM store and the TM store had what I needed.  My jeans were on hold for me for 24hours.    When I got to the TM-MM store the following day, I was greeted by the store manager.  Can't remember her name but she was awesome!!  The jeans I had on hold, I decided against buying them.  They just didn't feel right.  The manager the proceeded to pull 5 different styles of jeans for me to try on.  Told me to take my time, and walk around in them a bit.    What was supposed to be a quick (lol..I ain't getting around anywhere quickly these days) pop in and out, ended up turning into me being there over 30 minutes.  She took her time with me and was very attentive.  Of course being pregnant, I had to pee 5 minutes after I got into the store and she let me use the store bathroom.  That right there scores bonus points in my eyes.    MM has some awesome sales too  - Buy 1 pair of jeans, get another 50% off.   I walked out with 2 pairs of jeans.  1 swapped out for the return.  The other 50% off.  You cant beat that savings with a stick..or a Boppy.  Though being beat with a Boppy would be a lot more comfortable than the stick.  ;P

phone  review -well I was going to use 2 medium free fry tickets we got via the monopoly game. But apparently you have to have 2 people in the vehicle...1 ticket get person. So I can order 2 grilled chicken sandwich combos and pay full price  and they don't give a crap...But to piece meal the order to get it cheaper...it required 2 people in the car. J and I both call Bull shit. Keep your shit food. I'm going to Chick-fil-a.

After getting into an arguement at another Az casino with a fellow BJ player, I've decided that table poker is the game for me.  3 Card Poker specifically!!!   Love going to the Wild Horse Pass casino.  All the table dealers I've dealt with there are very friendly, both when you're winning and losing.  Trust me, I've seen my fair share of "coolers" who have been asshats in other casinos.  The dealer I had this past Friday night was especially helpful to a friend of mine, a newbie to 3 card, and taught her the basics.     The 27/7 cafe has decent food.  Though I think next time, I'll just order a side of bacon and an order of sourdough toast instead of a club on sourdough.  The bacon they have there...seriously...AWESOME!    Finally....Many THANKS to Wild Horse Pass for having a $5min 3 card Poker table on Friday night!  And a BIG thank you to the dealer who dealt me the 3 of a kind and the straight flush!  Cha Ching!!  Color up Yo!  :D

Wonderful Experience!    J and I had our first date night - post baby 2 weeks ago.  So we got dressed up, J in a suit and myself in a dress.  We were a little surprised that people were there dressed in jeans, shorts, flip flops, etc.  But whatever, we prefer to eat our $100 dinner dressed nicely.  LOL  We originally went got the AZ Restaurant Week offer.  $30 a person.  However, in looking at the menu. We decided that we wanted to do a dessert fondue, which didn't come with the AZ Rest. week menu.  So we opted for the traditional 4 course classic dinner - Cheese, Salad, Entree, and Chocolate.    All of our courses were amazing.  The cheese fondue was great , with the pumpernickel bread (at least I think it was pumpernickel).  The salads were a little over-dressed.  But mine, the California (candied pecans, spring mix, gorgonzola) was tasty.  J still enjoyed his Caesar, with the encrusted pine nuts.  The entrees - shrimp, crusted sirloin,  chicken breast and teriyaki-marinated sirloin, and marinated pork.  J' favorite, the teri sirloin and the pork.  My favorite, the shrimp and crusted sirloin.  And the dessert fondue - The flaming turtle!!!!  Milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans.  OMG so good I wanted to lick the fondue bowl.  I didn't lick the bowl, but I did run my finger along the inside.  Only did that once though cause it was hot!  lol  We'll definitely be back again for a special night out.

I strive to take care of my purchases, especially big ticket items like vehicles. Having worked in the past for a GM dealership in the parts department, I know a little bit about cars and the cost to keep them in running order. So, every 5-8k miles (sooner depending on where my levels are at. Thanks to my grandpa, I knew at the age of 15 how to change a tire and check fluid levels.), I make sure to get the truck in for a LOF (lube, oil, & filter).   After I learned that the mechanic I had been going to for quite a few years was trying to screw me over on a new set of tires (unfortunately my tire shop went under. Darn this economy), I knew it was time to look for a new place to take my 97 Chevy P/U.   I had done some searching, via Yelp, to help J find a place to repair his windshield wiper linkage/transmission. After 3 quotes, including one from my old mechanic, he decided to take his business to Ken. J has informed me he'll join Yelp and write his own review. :D   So my review - Three weeks ago, I notice my brakes were squealing a little (the break wear sensors) but it wasn't too bad to warrant running to get it fixed asap. I knew I had a little time. After J got his wiper linkage fixed last week, and after hearing that Ken went above and beyond to get the part, I knew we had found a great mechanic.   Move forward to last week. What went from a squeal one week, jumped to a full on grind that was worse than nails on a chalkboard and was only alleviated by applying the breaks by this past weekend. I knew it was time to get in to the shop, and fast, lest I compromised my rotor anymore.   I called as soon as they opened Monday morning and mentioned that I believe my brakes needed work and if I could bring it down. Ken said sure and that was about it. I headed down to the shop immediately. At first I was a little taken aback by his lack of conversation. While Ken isn't very talkative (he is friendly though and I did get him to chuckle a little when he asked what my brakes sounded like. I said, "well they kinda sound like that ceiling fan there!" We both laughed.), he gets down to brass tacks.   Ken called me up a few hours later and lowered the boom. Front and back brakes (and needing to machine the rotors) and rear axle seals/rear diff. OUCH! Ken explained to me that unless I fixed the seal leak, getting rear brakes would be pointless, as the leak would cause poor breaking and would wear out my rear pads faster. Which means more $$$ down the road. I told him to go ahead and do the work. I also mentioned it needed a LOF and he said he'd throw that in. I ask how long the job will take and he says it will be done by Tuesday.   After I got off the phone, I thought about all the information he told me. I then thought to myself, "I wonder how many mechanics would have not mentioned/fixed the leak." Granted, not mentioning it would have saved me some money upfront, BUT I would have had to have gone back who knows how often to get the rear brakes done.   I receive a call yesterday around 2pm and Ken says that the truck is finished. AWESOME! Cause having to get rides to/from work sucks!!  I get there to find my truck all ready to go! I pay and the gal says she can go pull my truck out for me if I want. I tell her that there's no need. It was sitting in plain sight off to the side. I give my thanks and head on out.   No sooner than I put the truck in gear and drive off, I notice somethings different. Not only did they do the brake job, they fixed the gas pedal! The spring had broke about 2 years ago, and I never bothered to get it fixed nor did my old mechanic bother with fixing it or asking if I wanted it fixed. Also, this morning, I noticed that my truck was awfully shiny. I wiped it down on Friday, but it got rained on a little over the weekend. But seriously, it looks like it had been washed and waxed. So, hmmm....did Ken also have my truck washed? I haven't a clue. But seeing as how he went above and beyond, I wouldn't be surprised.   In a nutshell, Ken Bohl's was OUTSTANDING and "The J's" have found a new mechanic!! :D

Just around the corner from my house, this is my go to place for gasoline!  Usually one of the cheapest gas spots in town.  Friendly clerks (the tattoos young chick is my favorite).  Sad face though that gas is going up.  $1.70 a gallon was nice while it lasted!  :)

J and I have been attending a Basic Birthing and Breathing prenatal class up at Shea for almost 3 weeks now.  Final class is tomorrow night - Breathing!  :)  Great facility.  The parking lot infront of the main entrance is small.  I would suggest to other Yelpers to use valet, BUT, only if you're leaving prior to 8pm.  The valet lots are a little bit of a hike away (across the greenbelt), so if you're there after 8pm, you'll have to go get your own car.  Keys are left at the security desk infront of the main entrance.    But all in all a great facility.

I've been going to Rich PT/Foothills Sports Med PT since July after I injured my ankle.  (Casted for a month..worst month EVER.)  Mike, the PT I see, is seriously awesome.  And the tech team of Todd and Nicki are great too!  I've been treated by Doug once too and he is a great PT as well.       I have never had more fun or laughed so much while doing PT.  In the future, if ever I need PT again, I know where I'm going.  :)

If we could get my g-parents network switched over, I'd NEVER have them return to this St Lukes.  Quality of care seriously depends on who's on shift and what floor you're on.  Cath-Lab and ICU staff has always been fantastic, but staff on the 7th floor is a hit or a miss.  Likewise with staff in the ER.   Seriously makes me wonder WHY some people get into the medical field, when they clearly are not cut out for working in that type of environment.

We in the C-household are fans of Chick-Fil-A.  So when I was out at my moms last weekend, we were in need of lunch while we were out.  So I suggested the C-F-A on 99th.    OH...If you're a parent of a little one, I didnt know but thanks to one of the employees, I discovered they had these plastic mats to stick to the table for your LO to eat off of.  AWESOME IDEA!   Now if only I could get Baby C to leave it sticking to the table while he's eating....  lol  Clean establishment.  Courtious employees.  Killer Chicken.  :)

Evil Donut Shop for selling donut holes for .99 cents a dozen.   EVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!  I've only gone 2 times so far.  The first time not really counting because I went with a coworker and didnt buy anything.  BUT, I did ask if I could buy 2 holes (one glazed and one chocolate cake) instead of a dozen.  I sometimes have issues with fried items.  So I wanted to sample it first.  The gal just gave me the two and said, "Enjoy!"  I had no revenge of the holes the remainder of the day!  Wh00t Wh00t!     But seriously, how awesome is it that she just gave me 2 holes.    This morning, for some strange reason (the baby maybe ;) had me craving a donut.  So, off to Bosa myself and another coworker went!  I got a dozen holes (6 glazed, 6 chocolate) and a maple bar.  The maple bar I'm saving for tomorrow morning...i hope    I honestly think the glazed holes are my favorite, reminding me of a Krispy Kreme glazed.  But glazed or chocolate...these donuts rock!  My coworker even thought so too.    I would have taken a photo of the holes, but they didnt have a chance.  I eated them.  :)  I shall have to resist the urge to become a frequent BOSA customer!  RESIST Damnit.  RESISTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!

J and I went for Sunday Morning brunch at Wandering Horse the other Sunday. With all the 5 star reviews, we figured this place would be a hit. In the end, we were disappointed. J definitely was when he was given the total price at the register. Did he have sticker shock? That's putting it lightly! He stated, "For $50+ for the 2 of us, this better be good!"   The dining room is very nice and the staff is extremely friendly. After getting our drink order put in, we walked into the food room. Not as much of a selection as I had expected. I'm usually all over some Chinese food, but after looking over the selection, I passed it over. For the section we overall enjoyed the most, it was hands down the Mexican food.   Here's a rundown of what we tried and liked/disliked:   Sushi - J said they were pretty good for California Rolls.  Prime Rib - Very tender. Lacking in flavor though. Thank goodness for the horseradish sauce.  Peppered bacon - Very fatty. J said it was more like eating a slice of fatty ham than crispy bacon.  French Toast w/ Blueberry sauce - This was a favorite of mine.  Green Chili - This was one of our favorite dishes. Paired with the fresh house made tortillas, beans, and rice.  Lamb Chops - This was our other favorite dish. Very flavorful and tender.   All in all, we felt like it wasn't worth the money for us to eat there.

This past Friday was mine and J's first trip (Saw The Avengers) to The Glendale West Wind Drive-In.  Though we still have a bitter taste in our mouths due to Scottsdale 6 closing (THANKS SRPMIC...grrrr), this location serves as a decent replacement.    Paved lots.  Kids playground.  Newer bathrooms. (Newer than what was a The Six) Still $6.50 for a double feature.  You can still bring your own food and drinks.    Though it's a slight drive for us, J and I will definitely be bringing Baby C. here when we want to enjoy a movie night.     Long Live Nostalgia and a Piece of Americana.

When I am in the mood for Chinese takeout and pressed for time (a case of food poisoning which sent me to the hospital keeps me from stepping foot inside a Panda), I head to Rice Garden inside Bashes.   Open at 11am, I know I can quickly head over, grab lunch, and get back to work within 15 minutes. My order is usually the same every time - Rice Noodles, Lemon Chicken, and BBQ Pork!   They have a free combo punch card, buy 9 combos and get a Free 2 item combo on your next visit. 2 more punches and HELLO free Lemon Chicken and BBQ Pork!!!   Now, back to work and my lunch from Rice Garden!! YUM!

When our kitchen sink decided to back up on us last week, J and I tried our "tried and true" Clog Buster.  Take apart trap, etc, connect to hose, cross fingers, and turn on the water.  Shut off water. Curse.  Stomp.  Curse some more.  And then search Yelp for plumbers.   I came across Ron's business.  Boy am I sure glad I did too!  J gave him a call, and after he told Ron what all we've done, Ron gave J a flat (and very fair, i might add) price to come and unclog our drain and main vent (which you have to access from the roof).   J said he was in and out in about 90 minutes.  I got home just in time to pay him.  His work comes with a 30 day guarantee, which is awesome!  From now on, if ever we cant unclog a drain ourselves (like in this case), I know who we are calling!   :)

Do I want a green yard? Yes. Do I want working sprinklers? Yes. Do I want to pay through the nose to have them fixed? NO! And finally, Do I know how to repair them myself? No, but give me a DIY website and I can just about fix anything!   It seems that my house has issues with water. Bathtub not draining - Fixed myself. Discovered that its best to NOT put orange rinds down the disposal - Hubby fixed. Busted bubbler valve on sprinkler - We fixed (capped it off). 3 of 5 sprinklers not working and anti-siphon valve leaking - Might need to call in the calvery.   So I called Discount Sprinkler (called a few other contractors who were lic/bond/ins. Discount is NOT Lic/bond/insured). Discount was the second company to show up - 1hr late. Possible Red Flag. Drove up in old beater van and practically parked in the street. Possible Red Flag.   The first estimate - $150.00 (anti-siphon valve and 3 new heads) Hmm... $150.00?  Let's keep talking.  After that quote, I asked him about the solenoid valves below the ground. I wanted them gone and to have the system manual.   He went for a shovel, and started digging out around the valves. Then he started messing with them, taking some of them apart and then turning on the sprinklers multiple times by cranking the (already ready for the dump, but not completely broken) anti-siphon valve. Yeah dude, I really wanted a shower/mud bath right now. Thanks.   After he was done screwing around, the anti-siphon valve was completely shot. It was not just leaking when turned on now, but producing a steady stream of water when in the off position.   New estimate - $325.00 (new manifold and anti-siphon valve)  The next thing out of his mouth, "So when do you want me to start the work?" I looked at J and he said to the guy we'd call him in 24-48 hours.   J and I proceed to go inside the house. I was PISSED! Do I think that guy purposely broke the valve to try to get the job? Hell Yes! Does J think the guy broke it on purpose? No. Does he think the guy was careless? Yes.   So, I did some research on the internet and called my uncle to ask for help.....   Trip to ACE Hardware - $2.50 in gas  3ft thick wall PVC pipe and PVC parts - $15.00  Labor - maybe 1hr 30minutes (total between 2 days)   Working sprinklers in the front yard that was a DIY project - Priceless!

Back again we go (okay, so this wasn't the C-Clan's first time back...Ive stopped counting how many times we've had SLD..lol) for some tasty dogs on Wednesday night at the PPM! I mention that I wanted to try something different than my jalapeno corn dog.  J about fell on the floor when I mentioned trying something new and building it from the toppings on the menu.   I shall name my dog creation - Tatonka aka Buffalo Dog.   Or maybe "The Leroy" after my mom's dachshund.  :)  Chicken dog, blue cheese, tomato, and the faux buffalo sauce concoction that Kat, Brad, and I conjured up!  AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!  I think next time I shall try adding cole slaw at Kat's suggestion.  And maybe some onion.     And congrats to the Short Leash Family on the brick and mortar venture!!   The C-Clan is looking forward to the grand opening!

Picnic Co...errrrr...no wait, Cafe Martha, oh how I've missed you, eh? I work in Old Town and well let's just say, there are not too many lunch eateries to choose from in the neighborhood. And in the industry I am in, I sometimes do not get a lunch hour. Thus, I have to run out quickly and grab a bite to bring back to eat at my desk (if I do not do as I should and bring something for lunch.).   The former Picnic Co. was close, convenient, and fairly decent quality. More so than the cafe in the middle of our complex courtyard that has been dubbed by many in the company as "Pasicko's". So when Picnic Co. closed its doors last year, a lot of us in the building (more so my department) were dumbfounded and stumped on where to go.   The word traveled quickly that Cafe Martha's was opening up where Picnic Co used to be. Would it be just as good as PC? Would the prices be reasonable? Only one way to find out!   I walked in and saw 2 former PC employees working behind the counter. Okay, things are looking positive. A gentleman was stationed by the door with a guitar and amp playing some blues. Nice touch. Found out that the sister owners also own Baby K's in phoenix.   On to the food - I ordered the Chef Salad, as I always did when it was PC with Ranch dressing. I got back to work and took my salad out of the bag. Can I get a side of lettuce with that turkey, ham, etc? SHEESH did they pack the meat on that salad!! I'm not complaining though! lol :) The ranch tasted homemade, which is what they claim all of their dressings to be. And because I am a sucker for sweets sometimes, I bought one of the giant rice krispie treats. YUM!  I was good and shared the rice krispie though a few coworkers.    C.M. - I'll be back! :)

After my long time esthetician needed to refocus on getting healthy (she's now a cancer survivor!) and quit the industry back in April, it was a mad dash to find a new esthetician (mainly for brow waxing).  Now less than 3 months out from my wedding, I refused to go back to the "Nail Places" and get anorexic brows again. So since May, I've gone without getting my brows waxed.   Tweezing (You pluck a chicken, you tweeze your brows folks!), kept me from looking like Chewbacca, but it was seriously time to bite the bullet and try someone new. Thank goodness my friend Jana, who works in a directly related industry, heard my silent plea, because she directed me to Rio Waxing Salon!   I had my first waxing session yesterday and Liz was wonderful. I enjoyed the experience so much that I decided to pay for a series of 11 (since I was a first time client, I ended up getting 3 free).  And I already have my next appointment scheduled for next month.   The location is very cute, and somewhat hidden/secluded. You blink and you miss it! The staff is awesome and friendly. I look forward to returning!   On a side note - I guess my tweezing didn't help much because someone here at work commented a little while ago...OH you found a new waxer and got your brows waxed!?   arwrawrarwarwrarrwrarrwr (my wookie sound) LOL

I went in this past Friday for my 2nd brow waxing of my 11 brow series.  I purposely booked with Danielli this time.  All I can say is, she is AMAZING (not to mention ultra friendly) and a perfectionist like my previous esthetician!    She truly is, "The Queen of Waxing!"

After our house got broken into this past Tuesday morning (SOB Azzbag!), I was so disorientated the rest of the day/night that I forgot that using the washing machine (the Douchebag threw clean clothes I had ontop of the dresser on the floor trying to get out of our bedroom window..and i did not like the thought of putting on clothes some skeevy ass had his hands on) and running the convection oven (i was making dinner for us and our friend who was installing our new backdoor) will trip the breaker for that outlet.  With 5 minutes left on the washer, the spin cycle starts up.  And next thing I know, it stops and the convection oven shuts off.  DAMNIT ALL TO HELL!!  We try resetting the breaker, like we've done in the past, but it was no use.  The breaker to that outlet was broken.    I scour the yelp app for an electrician after we see that the breaker is done in and the first listing to pop up is Good Guys Electric.  I proceed to call at 8:30 am yesterday and find out prices and availability.  Mike had a call he was going to just down the road from our house later that day and asked if I'd be home.  Otherwise, he was so booked that we would have had to wait til next week.  Unfortunately and thankfully, both my husband and I were home all day due to total exhaustion and restless sleep the day/night before.  He said he anticipated it being around 12-1pm but could be earlier.  But he'd call when he was in route.  I said no worries and thanked him multiple times for squeezing us in.    Mike showed up a little after 1pm and immediately got to work.  He made his suggestions on what he'd do with the breaker issue.  I told him that I trust his judgment and that this was profession, and he came very well reviewed on Yelp....so to do what he thought best to get things fixed.  He said he'd have to go run to Home Depot to buy the 2 new breakers (the broken breaker was actually 2 breakers in 1..both 15s and the washer alone should be on a 20) and he'd call me from there with prices.  I again said to him...do what you see fit.  I trust your judgment and feel that you're honest.  He returned about 30 minutes later with 2 new breakers and had the job done about 10-15 minutes later.    Charged us for 1 hour labor and the cost of the 2 breakers.    I almost wanted to cry when I saw the invoice.  VERY REASONABLE labor charge!  After I paid Mike, I told him that I felt I should give him a hug for helping us out and squeezing us in like he did.  I told him that if we need an electrician for anything, I know who I'm calling.    Mike and Good Guys Electric = AWESOME!!

J and I decided to go to First Friday, just for the sake of trying out the food trucks!  We discovered the little gem, Jamburritos!!    $6 Chicken Jamburrito = tasty and very filling!!  :) And more than enough food to feed both J and myself.  I will say though, that the burrito could have been rolled a little tighter.  $2 hush puppies = Super tasty!!!  The jamburrito had a nice little kick of spice to it.  Very Tasty!!  J and I were stuffed after each of us having half of the burrito (along with sharing half a hamburger from Ralph's).  Well worth the $8.00 for the burrito and hush puppies.

I raced down to SkySong to grab lunch from the food trucks today during my break.  Now, J isn't a fan of Filipino food.  And I never had an urge to try it.  BUT..when i saw that my only food truck option today was going to be either Hey Joe or standing in line behind 6+ people for SL (I love SL, but had to get back to work within 20 minutes), I figured this must be fate - Try Hey Joe!  There were a few guys picking up their order and I asked what it was they had.  They told me it was Pancit, but it wasn't on the menu anymore.  I thought to myself...crap!  BUT, the gal said...we have one more order left.  It was meant to be!!    To tell you how good it is, I am still eating my order of Pancit while typing out this review.  It's that good, I couldn't wait to write about it!  Pancit - a rice style noodle, veggies (carrot, onion, bell peppers), and chicken.  A good deal of spice to it, but not overpowering.      Super tasty!

I've been to Park Avenue now 3 times.  First time was for a mani/pedi due to the sign I saw at the corner of 48th and Indian School (I live in the area) advertising $25 peds and $15 manis.  I learned after the fact that those are member prices.    While I didn't get the membership (something about having my CC on file and being charged monthly to get a $5 discount just doesn't jive with me), Adrian did a great job with my pedicure and manicure!    Adrian talked me into having Lino blow out my hair my next visit.  And I don't just let ANYONE touch my hair, because not everyone knows how to handle curly hair.  But after seeing Lino's before and after hair shots, I decided to give him a go.    I returned a few weeks later for a manicure and a shampoo/blowout with Lino.  Let me tell you, I don't know what kind of products they're using at P.A, but Lino was able to comb through my wet hair in less than 2 minutes.  INCREDIBLE.  And my hair wasn't ripped through or damaged in the comb-out process.  Honestly, the most gentle comb-out I've ever had (even including myself combing out my own hair).  With a round brush and hair dryer, Lino tamed my curly mane into sleek straight locks with a little bit of volume.  I paid just about the same price as what I do when I see my regular hair gal down in Chandler.  I saved $$ on gas, so I consider P.A a cheaper option for getting my hair done.    Only thing that would make the Nail Bar/Salon better is the following things -   1) 86 the "membership" and offer the membership prices as regular prices (It's only a $5 discount anyway).  If you price it right, the "regulars" will come.   But seriously...either get rid of the sign or honor the sign prices for mani/pedis - ESPECIALLY IF THE SIGN OUT FRONT DOESN'T STATE THOSE ARE MEMBER PRICES!!     2) It's not a nail  "chop shop" so 86 the $5 up-sell for additional treatments. Not that the nail techs up-sell, because they don't.  But I want to be able to ask for a callus or scrub treatment and not have the tech utter the phrase,  "that's an extra $5".   ....which leads me to the final thing....     3) Offer a Deluxe Pedi or Mani for 1 price  (cuticle work, callus treatment, salt/sugar scrub, and paraffin - $XX.xx).  I can get a deluxe pedicure with my regular gal, at an upscale N.Scottsdale salon at that, for $30 because I've been a client of hers for years.  The only thing that sucks is the commute.    So seriously - P.A owner - get with the Deluxe services.    In the end, though I hate that I'm "cheating" on my regular nail and hair gals, think I've found a closer option for mani/pedis and getting my hair done.

Pretty Good.  Pretty Good!  Normally Gyros, falafel, and tzatziki give me indigestion.  But this time, it did not.    The spanakopita was alright.  But the Falafel, gyro, and fries were tasty!  And I swear, the guys behind the couner were actually Greek!

Why have I not written a review for Modern Mommy yet?!?!    I've gone here a number of times to purchase items I've needed.  This store is amazing and the salesgals there are very informative!!  This place has everything from nursing bras and baby clothes to hospital grade pumps rentals and baby carriers!    We went on Black Friday (there was a 25% off deal going on if you were there before 12noon).  I not only got a great nursing bra, but we got this contraption to put on the changing mat so Baby C cant roll off while dad is changing him.  Oh and we also purchased a Becco!  The Becco by far was the best purchase as it has gotten a lot of use (mainly by dad) since we purchased it.  Money well spent!    I returned to Modern Mommy this last Sunday and grabbed some GoLacta.  I called ahead of time to make sure it was in stock, and the salesgal held a bottle for me.  Only place in the state that sells GoLacta.  :)  Oh and they have free breastfeeding support meeting on Tuesday mornings.  Always helpful for a new mama who might be having issues with nursing her little one.

I and I decided to give this place a try on saturday. $ 7 for a fresh custom burger with your choice of side? Not too shabby! The burgers were a little on the greasy side, but still good. The steak fries were a little greasy too. But the homemade chips were excellent! We didn't order any but got to try a sample. Next visit I'm going with chips!   Yeah, I said next visit. I'll be back!

After taking a huge hit to the pocketbook last summer for the SRP bill, plus after attending the Home and Garden Expo in January, I decided to take action and look into getting some sunscreens on the house.   Coming from a family of contractors, I know the questions to ask, and the websites to search (AZRoc, etc). After already getting bids from 4 other companies, Christan (CC) was the last contractor to come and give me a bid on 6 sunscreens and 2 rescreens of our security doors.   Christan did not just come to give us an estimate and take half ass measurements. She took EXACT measurements, right down to the 7/8 of an inch. Said that if I was still getting estimates, to just give the businesses the measurements so I could get a quote over the phone. WHAT COMPANY DOES THAT!? Here, use my measurements and save the other companies the time and gas of having to come out. I think it was at that moment, I knew I would probably be going with CC Sunscreens.   When it came to the door screens, I opened them so she could get measurements. Right off the bat, she stated that they only had frames in the 1inch size. Every other company said they could rescreen these doors, without even opening the doors and looking at the size frame were needed. But stating that all their screens had 1 inch frames. Makes me curious if I would have gone with another company, what would have happened with the door screens.   $262.00 for 6 sunscreens using Textilene 90%.   The sunscreens were installed yesterday. But I don't think Sunday installations are a regular thing - playing catch-up for their customers due to their install truck being totaled a few weeks ago. I didn't mind the few extra weeks wait seeing as I had not given them money yet. I knew I'd get my screens sooner or later. And thankfully Mother Nature cooperated and it stayed unseasonably cool for those few weeks!   We love the results of the sunscreens so much, I called them hours after the installation. We noticed that big of a diffrence. We scheduled an appointment for tomorrow to get a bid on the remaining 3 windows, all north facing.     I look forward to seeing a cheaper SRP bill this summer! :)

I think the chicken that is used is fed crack before processing, because it is that tasty.  I hate using the term moist, but this chicken is uber moist and tender.    UGH..moist.  But there are not any other words suitable to use in place of moist.   Hmm a few synonyms for moist - Clammy, oozy, drippy, dank.  Thankfully Chick Fil A's chicken isnt  any of those.  If it was, we'd have a problem.  I guess I'll have to stick with moist.  Shudder.  lol   The waffle fries are awesome, especially when dipped in Polynesian sauce.  And to quote Jules from Pulp Fiction..the diet lemonade -  "a tasty beverage".    The Customer Service - EXEMPLARY!

Came here for breakfast with the girls before we got in the road. Fast service. Delicious food. The spicy breakfast wrap was awesome. Huge portions, which is great if your splitting with someone or live local and can get it to a fridge.  Will definitely go again next time I'm in Vegas.

Okay Five Guys....You've won me over since the last time I partook in some meatygoodness that is a five guys burger.    Our food wasnt as Gr---easeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy (In my best Paulie Shore voice) as it was last time.  Our canjun fries were nice and crispy.    Well, at least the food didnt seem as greasy.  Though my lack of a gallbladder would have said differently about 30 minutes later.  Thank goodness Target and Burlington had clean bathrooms!  O_o  EEK!  :P

It was between this place and the gyro place next door Friday night.   The pizzas looked good.  However, this place just rubbed me the wrong way.  I'm sorry but after looking and seeing that all of the pizzas were premade, sitting on a countertop, room temp...for who knows how long...ready to be tossed into the oven to reheat....that just turned me off.  It would have been one thing if the pizzas were veggie/cheese, but there were meat pizzas there too!    I passed on the food poisioning.  Gyros won.

Needed to get a quick pedi and couldn't make it up to see my regular gal in N.Scotts.  So I found Pro Nails by Julie via yelp.    Had the regular pedicure with callous treatment, paraffin, and nail art added.  The gal that did my services was very friendly.    The callous treatment, some of it was starting to burn the tip of my toe and I told her.  She immediately dunked my foot in water.  The paraffin treatment was too hot and I informed her that it was burning my feet.  The nail art, she did a good job initially.  Then got sloppy with the thin metallic nail polish (you know the stuff that they use to make squiggly lines, etc).  A huge glob came out at the end and ruined a good portion of the nail design on my one toe.    They use these plastic inserts in the tubs, which one may think helps with sanitation.  But I think that technically (I'm about 95% sure) they're still supposed to use a disinfecting solution between clients.  Letting the solution circulate 10 minutes.    After all, just because there is a liner, doesn't mean that the water that your feet are sitting in isn't touching the jets that propel the water to make the circulating action and bubbles.    That's what I get for cheating my on my regular nail gal....being out $40 for a pedicure.   I probably wont be back.

When the format change happened a last year, this station lost its spot on my radio presets.  Whoever made the executive decision to 86 the alternative format, you need to be tied up and have cassette tapes thrown at your head.    You already had most of the valley Clear Channel stations to listen to the Black Eyed Peas and whatever other top 40s bubble gum crap.    Why did you have to get rid of the only alternative/punk/ska station in the valley!?  I want my Ramones and Depeche Mode!  I want Chuck Powell and the Morning Ritual!    "It is a format that has mass appeal with upscale adults. The business decision is to appeal to a large audience with financial means and discretionary income, and is the fastest growing format and the #1 format for out-of-home listening."  So I guess that means that us tattooed and pierced people are broke-asses.  I sure wish the IRS knew that and would quit raping me every pay period and come tax time.  Cause, they seem to think I'm made of money.

Neil and crew are fantastic.  They have done a bit of work on our popup.  some welding work on the tongue, serviced the axel and repacked bearings, news tires, new 7 pin/wiring, and new springs.  Honest guys.  Very reasonable prices. They'll be doing all our trailer work from here on out.

Pizza with homemade crust - baked to order in 8 minutes...in a food truck!?!?!?   INSANE!!!  I was initially reluctant to try Pizza People one Sunday when we went to 4peaks tasting room.  I figured, these people are doing pizza in a truck.  That has to spell disaster in your mouth.  OH WAS I WRONG!  J, Baby C, and I went to the Phoenix Public market last Wednesday night to partake in some tasty goodness from the food trucks.  J had had Pizza People at Food Truck Friday the week prior and suggested I give them a go.  I caved after he said it met his seal of approval.    The crust is chewy, which I LOVE!!  You can either make your own pizza from their list of toppings or choose one of their pizza creations.  I was not in a meat kinda mood - J wants meat at every meal.  lol  The guy at the window said we could do a half and half - AWESOME!    My half I had spinach, feta, and tomato.   J's half...I don't even remember..cause I was all about my half!  Only thing I would ask them to do next time is cook the pizza for maybe 2 minutes longer - The pizza crust had that limpness to it in the middle.  I like a super done crust.  :)    Would I go back to Pizza People?  Heckkkkk Yes!

Decent for Chinese food - Take out.  The owner, or who I believe is to be the owner, is very friendly.  Heading over to open the door for his customers coming inside.  Bringing menus over to the table and after you order, your food over to your table.    Not your average Chinese Take-out restaurant.  Leftovers reheated decently too.  :)

Finally broke down and tried Luncha Libre at this past Saturday's Food Truck Caravan in Scottsdale.    What the hell have I been waiting for!?   I had the Steak and Blue - Cause 2 of my loves are STEAK and moldy cheese goodness.  J and the Thai'D Up, which he said was nice and spicy.  A little bit on the pricey side for the portion, but you'll wont go hungry after eating 1 quesadilla.  Had a strawberry banana Luncharita...which was super tasty!  Pretty nifty putting them in glass mason jars.  And I hear tell that if you bring the mason jar back, you'll get $1 off your next visit!    I think we'll return

Now I know I just wrote a review of L.L. last week, but we went to the P.P.M. last night and had L.L. again.    Update from 4 to now 5 stars.   Why?  Because of a few things which I'm going to list right now:  1 - Integrity. We brought our 2 mason jars back last night and were due to get a $1 off each  Luncharita.  We had asked, and the guy confirmed that it was $1 if you brought a jar back.  We sat the jars down on the table and thought nothing of it, thinking we'd get our discount.  Well I guess we didn't. When we ordered, he asked if I wanted a receipt, but I said it wasn't necessary.  The guy noticed the jars on the table when I went up to get our food and said.."Wow, I completely forgot to give you your $2 off for the jars."  He handed J 2 $1.00 bills after he helped me walk our food to the table.       2 - Benevolence.  While we were up at the table deciding on our order, I noticed a flier on the table.  They're donating a portion of August's sales to the Hey Joe family (cant remember the husband/wife's names) to help out with their medical costs.  Hey Joe's wife was just diagnosed with cancer.     There truly is a great camaraderie among some of the food trucks owner/operators.      Our order last night - 2 Luncharitas, 1 Steak and Blue (super awesome), and 1 Papas con Chorizo (super awesome with great flavor/seasoning).    If you haven't tried Luncha Libre yet...you should be beaten.. with a tortilla.

On the hunt for a new Doctor (when my doctor up and retired and the new practice didn't take my insurance) and where to do I turn to - Yelp!  I've seen Dr. Lillo now twice this month. The nurses are very friendly and Dr Lillo has been fantastic thus far.  :)  First visit - get new scripts before this plan year runs out and my rx benefits change.  I was out of refills anyway. I mention to Dr Lillo that J hates that I snore like a freight train.  Dr. Lillo looks up my nose - Severe blockage - 70% and states that my throat is very small.  Has some suspicions, gives me some allergy nasal meds to try out for a few weeks and wants me to come in at the beginning of the year for a full workup.  Preventative is covered 100%, so why not.  I schedule my appointment.   Second visit - I screw up my shoulder/arm this past Monday at class.  I mess it up so bad that I thought J was going to have to rush me to the ER I was in that much pain.  I gutted it out though and scheduled an appointment to see Lillo Tuesday morning.  He checks things out and sends me downstairs for an xray.  Said that due to the holiday it would probably be a few days before they got the results back.    Fast forward to this morning - I get a phone call at 0645.  I answer thinking it's Little C's daycare.  Nope.  It's Dr. Lillo!  What doctor calls to tell you personally your lab/imaging results?!  He said for me to continue taking the meds he prescribed and that we'll reevaluate when I go in in 10 days for my workup (if I need an MRI, etc)  Here's hoping everything resolves itself.  (only thing that sucks is that my deductible starts over Jan 1...stupid me getting hurt at the end of the year.  DOH!)

J and I had to go to the Fossil store last Thursday because his 2 watches needing repairing.  Forgetting where the entrance that's right next to the store, we ended up walking through Nordy.    Just outside the top floor doors of Nordy, there's Caketini.  A cute little shop, which I think the original shop that was there years ago used to be affiliated with selling Nordy cookies.    Sweets + Me = Yummyness for Baby C and I!  I couldnt resist, so we went inside.   I originally was just going to get a cake pop.  But I decided to get a German Chocolate Cupcake (MY FAVORITE!!!) and a vanilla pop.  J got the Key Lime pop and a Smore cupcake.    J liked his pop.  Love?  That I'm not sure of.  I on the other hand did not enjoy mine, at all!  It was very gummy and almost had the texture of cake with paste.  You know paste, the kind your teacher told you not to eat as a kid in the classroom.  I gave the rest to J.    Now the cupcakes.    J said the Smore frosting stuff was cloying and the cake was dry.  He didnt even eat half of his.  My cupcake too was very dry.  And the traditional GC frosting (which I love) was one note.  I didnt even eat 1/4 of the cupcake. Now if I hadnt already known what German Chocolate cake tasted like, and had tried this....I doubt I would every try GC again.    $12+ for a lot of disappointment.  :(  I seriously wonder if the reason for the dry cake is because they have everything in a cooler case.    I am having flashbacks from a certain little bakery/cupcake shop I reviewed for my wedding bakery.    Make the memories go away!!!!

I was initially a little hesitant on trying Aji mobile, but when I saw that they can turn any sandwich into a bowl...and the bowls looked REALLY good...I figured okay, let's give them a try.   So last Wednesday at the phoenix public market, J and I split a Cubana sandwich.  I've gotta tell you, it was one of the best Cuban sandwiches I've ever tasted!    A little pricey, but the flavor is fantastic!!  I'm sure we'll be back!  :)

Just opened up today, 01/13/2012,  I decided my craving of the Paradise Club and Black & White chippers was too great to not go.  Especially seeing as this place is a 2 minute walk from my office.  I was expecting this place to be packed, but somewhat disorganized.  Well, I was right about one thing.  It was packed!!  This location is where the old Fuddruckers was and has been completely remodeled.  It looks fantastic!  Lots of outdoor seating and indoor seating.     They were giving out samples for the chippers (of course), but also had samples for their mac & cheese.  OMG.  The mac & cheese is THE BOMB!!!   I decided to get not only a small cup of m&c, but my traditional club sandwich too.  *Hey, I'm pregnant...I can be greedy to an extent!  LOL*  And some cookies to take home - b&w chippers, 1 macademia, and 1 oatmeal.    As we were about to head back to work with lunches in tote, we were offered another sample - the Frontega Chicken Panini.   This too was awesome!!  I think the next time I walk over for lunch, I'll get that instead of the club.    The staff was awesome.  You'd think with the huge crowd, almost leading out the door, they'd be on edge and grumpy.  Not them!  Very helpful and friendly.    Shall I return?  Yes!  This location is going to be very dangerous for me and my pocketbook!  LOL

Added Additional Food Items -  8/1/13  Customer Service - Top Notch!!!    I hang my head in shame to admit that according the visits on my receipt, I've been to this Paradise a total of 51 times.  LOL  Soups/Salads/Sandwiches:   Summer Corn Chowder -  Two Thumbs Up  Broccoli Cheese - Thumbs Up Fire Roasted Tomato - Thumbs Up Garden Vegetable with Pesto - Thumbs Up Mac & Cheese - Thumbs Up  Strawberry Poppyseed & Chicken - Thumbs up!  This is my first time ordering a "salad".  It was pretty good, but I think I'll ask them though to only use half a spoonful of dressing when I get a half salad again.  I would get it on the side, but I like how they toss the salad, distributing the dressing.   Sierra Turkey - Very dry.  Checked and only had a small dab of the spread is on the sandwich.  Onion was too overpowering.  Bacon Turkey Bravo - My go to sandwich.  Nuff Said Tuna Sandwich - WAY too much mayo.  Not ordering again.  Frontega Chicken - Thumbs Up Paradise Club - Thumbs Up Pasta Salad - Thumbs Up  Cookies:  Chocolate Chip - Two Thumbs Up Oatmeal - Two Thumbs Up  I'll add more to this list as I try other menu items....

J and I were planning on attending this event.  Mainly because I had purchased a Groupon that got us 2 for the price of 1.  That and we have watched both seasons of F.T.R and love it!  Needless to say, we were pretty excited for this event.   We got to Indian Bend and the 101 around 10:00am.  Having never been to the ballpark before, I wasn't sure if I was heading in the right direction.  No sooner than I got to Pima, I start seeing the line of cars.     It takes 30 minutes to finally get to a lot entrance.  I ask the guy standing at the entrance if there's expectant mother parking.  He says no, but that I'm free to park in the area where they're directing those with handicapped plates and placecards.  I thank him and drive over to the grassy knoll.  I don't even have a chance to put my truck into park before some guy comes running over telling me I cant park there.  I very strongly said, "Well I'm pregnant, and the gentleman right over there said that I could."  He doesn't say another word.  The woman in the car next to me then said, "They'll end up giving you a ticket."  I state that since this isn't technically handicapped parking - No signs that state HC only parking - They technically don't have the right.  I then remembered where I was and I didn't really feel like fooling around with tribal cops.   I throw the truck into reverse and get in the line to head to park with the rest of the cars.    We finally get to the head of the parking line and next thing we know, we're being told parking is $5.  NO WHERE ON OUR WAY INTO THE LOT WE WERE PARKING IN DID IT STATE PARKING WAS $5!!!  We were livid.  No where on the event website did it state that parking was $5.  We pretty much yell this to the min. wage lot attendants.  AND - Where does SRPM get off charging people $5 to park in a f-ing DIRT LOT!?   $7 for parking for events at the State Fair location in Phoenix (which they have noted on their website)- to park on a paved lot.....Fine.  $5 to park on a f-ing dirt lot?  I told them where they could shove the car behind me's $5 and make a U-Turn to leave.    J and I ended up going to breakfast instead - where we didn't have to pay to park.    From what I'm told, and from what I'm gathering with glancing at a few reviews - the Street Eats Festival was not worth it.  With long lines, and trucks running out of food.  I'm now kind of glad we bailed in the dirt lot.

It's taken me at least a week to finish this review.  I'm at a loss on what to say about Mamma Toledo's pies that will do them justice...they're just that freakin tasty!!  I think Tonya puts crack in her pies! Tasty Tasty Crack Pie.      Other than my grandma, my mom, and myself - every other pie and pie crust I've had has fallen short.  Tender and flaky.  That's what a traditional pie crust should be like.  And the pies you purchase from Mamma Toledo's are just that - T&F!    (looks around for Alton Brown's Tender and Flaky boxing puppets)   The fruit pies - I heat them up in the toaster oven for about 7 minutes.  The cheese and cream pies...eat'em cold..DUH!  ;)  CRACK PIE!!!

Visited this truck when we went to the Children's Museum January Play Date.  There were 2 options for food, and this truck was one of them.  Ive gotta say...We've had better.    Hubby's Order -  Jamaican Jerk Chicken Burrito Red Beans with Andoullie and Rice  They were out of tortillas, so they made him a bowl instead.   They didn't put Andoullie in the Red Beans and Rice.  But he said he thinks they didn't charge him full price on that item.  The red beans and rice was more like...a ton of rice, with some kidney beans thrown on top.  He ate maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of each and tossed the rest.  Said it was too much starch as the Jamaican Jerk Chicken had a ton of rice in it as well.    My Order -  Cajun Shrimp Po' Boy with fries  Now as I've never had a Po' Boy before...Im not sure if its supposed to be served hot or cold.  *quick google check*  Okay.  Per Wikipedia...traditionally served hot.  Well, this sandwich was cold.  It was pretty much like some cocktail shrimp and coleslaw tossed in a hoagie roll. The best thing about the order was the fries.  I wished I had ordered the Catfish or Chicken instead.   Or better yet....I wish we would have ate beforehand.

Quick and Easy.  Walk-ins accepted.  You can be in and our in less than 15 mintues!  I love the fact that they do not go through your insurance and have a "monthly pass" so to speak.    $49 for 4 adjustments = 1 per week = $12.25 per adjustment.  You cant beat that with a stick.  Most insurance companies have you pay a copay (between $10-$50).

This was my first visit to Qdoba.  And I must say, I really enjoyed the Mango Chicken Salad.  Had wthat with lots of pico and verde salsa with no cheese or sour cream....no tortilla bowl.  Pretty tasty!  Its too bad today was the last day they're offering the Mango Salsa as it is a seasonal item.  :(    I'll be back though!  Most likely only on Wednesdays when they offer my company lunch deals via email.  :)

I was over visiting my mom and step-dad with the baby last Saturday.  We were grabbing food to go.  My mom went to get a burrito next door and though I was following her inside Ch--otle.  But, after seeing Pita Kitchen's menu from the parking spot, decided to grab a gyro and greek salad instead.  The service was great!  The woman brought out my food, outside, after I told her I my step-dad was watching the baby in the truck.  Oh and I received my food roughly 10minutes after ordering.  One thing i noticed (while I was ordering) was I saw they have the traditional gyro loaf and slice off of it for each order.  My to-go order was a gyro combo with a greek salad instead of the fries.  The greek salad was very tasty!  The dressing came on the side, so I could control how much I wanted on the salad.  The gyro was on the greasy side, which was a little offputting.  And there wasnt any lettuce or tomato on it.  But the meat was nicely flavored.    I gave my mom and step-dad a taste of the salad and some of the gyro meat and they both said it was very good.  Neither of them have eaten Greek/Mediterranean food before.  My step-dad said the meat was nice and moist and very flavorful.  My mom raved and said that she wants to try Pita Kitchen next time they're ordering out!  :)

So, back to Pita Kitchen I went this past Saturday.  This time with my mom, step-dad, and Baby C!  We ordered and sat down at a table.    I got the same thing as my visit on the 20th - Gyro pita and greek salad.   This time the Gyro was NOT greasy.  Very tasty at that.  The Greek salad again was awesome.    My mom ordered the same thing as I and thought the food was good.  And my step-dad ordered the chicken souvlaki.  It came with rice and salad.  He liked it so much he almost cleaned his plate!  Seriously good food here!  So good that Baby C enjoyed some Gyro and chicken!  :)

Saturday 8AM - I leave the house with Little C and we head to his class.  All is fine with the house when we leave.    Saturday 1:00pm - We return home from class and I have lunch for all of us in tote.  I sit the bag down on this little patio table we have next to our swing.  Upon set down, hundreds if not thousands of these little bugs fall to the ground from under the table.  I look around... and utter to myself....WTF is this sh*t?!?!  They weren't ants.  They weren't beetles.  I have NO CLUE what the hell these things are that are all over. Slight panic sets in.    Saturday 5:00pm - These little bugs are starting to take over the front of the house.  They're EVERYWHERE.  Carport, front yard, planter box, wall of the house...EVERYWHERE. There were easily a million of these bugs, if there were 1.  My step-dad stops by the house to have a look and he's stumped too.  His suggestion - go to Ace and pick up some spray.  As I'm heading to Ace, I realize how big of a problem I have on my hands and I break out my phone and search for Pest Control on Yelp, filtering by Open Now.   Up pops Arizona Pest Squad with the 66 reviews and 4.5 stars.  I call, thinking that I wouldn't be able to have someone come out until Monday.  Wrong!  Oh was I so very wrong.  David told me he would be by around 7pm and said that since I was within a certain radius, it was a discounted rate.  And there wasn't going to be any additional charges for a last minute weekend service.  JACKPOT!    I leave to go to my g-parents, and when I got home around 9pm (i left a check with J), there wasn't a bug in sight and all of the spray had dried.  The product that was used is safe around kids and pets, but I still wanted to make sure it was dry before Little C and I got home.    David explained to me what the bugs were ("final cinch"), what needed to be done to insure they wouldn't come back.  We do a followup spray next week and will be scheduling regular spraying to keep our other critter problems in check - ants, crickets, and lovely summer roaches...YUCK!  Once again Yelp has come to my rescue.  :)

I have been using APS and David for my pest control services for about 2 years now.  Just a quick call to David/APS and my pest problems are covered. Ants making their way through the backdoor, no problem!  Holy sh*t...a dead black widow on the back door ramp, no problem! Then a month ago, my step-dad stops by to take care of a few things and tells me I need to have David have a look at something coming down from the ceiling in the carport. Step-dad didn't want to break the bad news to me himself. LOL  So I shoot David a msg and photo and he says it looks like termites!! From what I understand, if you live in Arizona, it is only a matter of time till your house gets termites. UGH!  Anyhow, even though APS does not do termite treatment, David forwarded my information to a guy/small company he trusts. Sure enough, we had effing subterranean termites trying to tunnel their way to the ground via these little tubes, from the ceiling in the carport! SMDH And the termite company he passed my into on to, outstanding service that was backed with a guarantee!  So thank you David! :D  When it comes to customer service and quality workmanship, there is NO beating David and APS!!!

J and I went here for a quick breakfast the day after Christmas.  We had Baby C in tow with us.    Can I just say that our waitress was AWESOME!!!  I was changing Baby C's diaper in the bathroom and well, let's just say that his whole outfit needed to be changed.  Oh and the ladies bathroom had a diaper changing station!  So helpful for patrons with little ones still in diapers!  Anyway....By the time I finished cleaning him up and got back to our table.  Our food had already been dropped off.  BUT, my food was no where in sight.  The waitress asked J if she could put my order back up on the pass so it would stay hot.  So when I got back to our table, a minute later, my breakfast arrives.    My breakfast - Peanut Butter and Jelly Pancakes!  Super tasty!    As we were getting ready to leave, I asked our waitress if we could have to go cups for our drinks (my water and J's soda).  She not only brought cups, but they were filled with our beverages.    Seriously awesome grub and service!!

Finally tried LuLu's last night at the PPM.  This was after Joe had been taunting me our last 3 visits with a sample.  I finally caved and got a sample last night (after seeing someones ice up close).    Why in the hell didn't I take Joe up on his sample when he asked me on our first time at PPM?!?!  The flavor is outstanding.  The texture is unbelievable!  And the price is very very reasonable!  $4.00 for 3 nice sized scoops.  J and I shared a cup and it was more than enough for both of us.    The strawberry-lemon and cherry (and I'm not a fan of cherry) combo is the way to go! :D

Went to TrueRest on Saturday and used a Groupon I had purchased.    After a 5 minute cheesy but kinda funny intro video, the 2 other newbs and myself were shown to a pod room and given a rundown on what to do.  We were then escorted to our rooms.    I will say that the float itself was kinda interesting.  I imagine if I were floating in the Dead Sea in Israel, it would be similar to floating in the pod.  After my float, I showered up and got dressed, I went to head back to the little oxygen bar area to chill for a little while, partake in a cup of tea and maybe try out the oxygen (for an additional fee).  But the 4 seats they have in that little waiting area were taken.  So I just headed back up to the front, checked out, and left.    Now according to the website - "Salt can be corrosive to clothes, but is great for skin and hair."  Well it was horrible for my hair (which is thick and curly).  I had to stop by my salon because after my float, my hair was fried.  All of the moisture was robbed from my hair and it was a hot mess.  Even after my hair guy got my hair washed, conditioned and gave me a good dose of Moroccan oil, my hair still feels dry and dull.  I'd hate to say it but, maybe there should be a disclaimer on the website, "if you have ethnic hair..the salt is going to trash your hair."  With chronic knee (from my surgery in 2011) and shoulder pain, I had hoped this salt float would help alleviate my pain.  My shoulder hurts worse than it did going in, my knee has been creaky, and I've had 2 migraines (I rarely have migraines.  And I drink plenty of water, at least a gallon a day).  So all in all, I've felt like sh*t since my float.    Would I float again, probably not.

Tried Satay Hut when we went down to the Gilbert Food Truck Court this past Friday night.    Ordering - with only 1 customer in front of me, after the gal took her order, she told me that she would be with me in a moment.  5+ minutes pass by.  Did she forget she had customers at her window?  Who knows.  We decide to order from another truck.  However, after we're informed that it will take 30+ minutes to get our food from the other truck, I got back in line for Satay Hut.    Though having your order taken even when you're at the window takes a while, I must say that you do get your order pretty quickly.    We got a pork and a beef skewer.  The beef was tough, dry, and definitely overcooked.  Seriously a good thing I have all of my teeth.  I didn't bother giving any to Baby C.  The pork was not as tough, BUT it was extremely fatty.  And the peanut sauce was nothing to write home about - probably peanut butter with some type of chili sauce mixed in.  Really overpowering.    At $3.50 a pop - I doubt we'll be getting satay from here again.

Thank goodness I had a DealChicken offer that got us in at 2-4-1.  Otherwise, I would have felt like we were seriously ripped off!  We park and get in the long line of what i thought was the line to get in.  Something told me to walk ahead towards the gate.  I told J to stay in line, just in case.  I walked ahead and finally see some signs...which were about 25 yards (100+ people) from where J was standing. Those signs stated that people that already had tickets/vouchers could go straight to the gate, so I flagged J down to come on up.  We get to the gate and get in pretty quickly. I'm glad I walked ahead, cause I know I would have been pissed to have to stand in that line for nothing.   Pretty much everything from that point kinda just went downhill.    We walk over to get tokens.  A little voice in my head as we were driving there told me to stop off at the bank.  But I ignored the voice.  Maybe because part of me figured why wouldn't an event like this NOT have Square, so you'd be able to use your credit/debit card.  Should have listened to the voice.  I was informed they only took cash for tokens.  I had $10 on me (which is rare, I never carry cash), so we got 5 tokens.    We walk around for a few minutes and decide to stop at one stand due to there not being a long line.  Word to the wise, the longer the line - the better the food.  No line usually equates to..umm...slop.  See taco photo.  The vendor that we got the bad tacos from had mac and cheese that wasn't too bad though.  But we were at the TACO FESTIVAL.  Not the mac and cheese festival.  :(  Literally no shade and definitely no seats to be found, unless you were purchased VIP tickets.  Sadly, this is the 3rd S.R.Fs event that we've gone to where we've been completely disappointed.  And honestly, this just seemed like an excuse for some to start drinking before noon and get piss drunk.   Total Time Spent at the Taco Festival = 30 minutes Total Spent = $16 (thank gawd we didn't have to pay for parking) Will We Attend Another Taco Festival = Nope.

Seriously!?!?  How in the HEII am I the first person to write a review for Sandra Dee's Catering!?!?  Crazy!  But woohoo ~ First Review!!  :)  I had made an executive/birthday decision last night for dinner.  It was either drive down to Fudds in Tempe and use a birthday coupon or do something else.  I decided to check out the Phoenix Street Coalition's facebook page and see if there were any food trucks gathering.  Lo and behold - Sandra Dee's was going to be right around the corner from us in Old Town!  I inform J...let's skip getting stuck in traffic and check this place out.  I'm certainly glad we did!!  Sandra D is very friendly and when I asked if I should get the Shrimp or Catfish Po boy, she suggested the shrimp and trying a basket instead.  So I could try the shrimp on their own.  I decided to go with her suggestion.    OMFG - The shrimp was AWESOME!!!  Lightly coated.  Not undercooked.  But not rubbery.  Awesome seasoning.  The sauce provided to dip, tasty too, but not needed.  The shrimp stood on their own.  :)  Seriously, these shrimp were so good that J enjoyed a few pieces too, and he's not a big fan of crustaceans!    As we were getting ready to leave, Sandra comes out of the trailer and I inform her that my dinner was amazing!  J, SD, and I get to talking and she mentions her gumbo.  We end up getting a sample of it to try.  That too was flipping amazing!    J's take on the Gumbo - "I'd describe the gumbo as sensational.  Well seasoned with a broth that puts others to shame.  The andouille was spectacular.  Firm and savory.  The shrimp perfectly cooked and every bite balanced"  We look forward to visiting Sandra Dee's Catering truck again!  :)

Terrible service.  Stood at the hostess area for at least 5 minutes before we were greeted.  Once we were seated, our waitress was MIA for the most part except to take our order and bring our food.  We had to ask our server for Chips and salsa, which are usually the first thing to hit the table.  And that didn't come for another 5-10 minutes.    The food is your standard Mexican restaurant fare - nothing to write home about though.    While we were waiting for our server to come by so we could get to-go boxes and the check, Baby C started fussy.  So instead of being "those parents", I took him outside and got him car ready.  I do all this thinking that his dad would be heading out in a few minutes.      After 10 minutes pass, Im starting to wonder WTH was going on...so I grab the baby and head back inside.  J is still sitting there at the table waiting for our server.  He gets up and asks someone to go get her.  A few minutes later, she comes by....she was apparently tending to silverware.  Yeah, lets forget that you have customers at a table lady.    We probably wont be back, which is a shame since this is right around the corner from the house.

Time my colleague and I walked into Panda - between 12:05-12:10pm Time on my receipt - 12:33:26PM    My colleague and I get there to find a line backed up to the door.  Now, at the other PE that I've been to (on 40th/Thomas), this isn't a problem.  The 40th/Thomas location moves people.  This Old Town/South Scottsdale location on the other hand assumes people don't have anywhere to be or that no one that comes in on their lunch hour.  There was plenty of food on the line (at least plenty of what we were going to order) so waiting on the "kitchen" to get out food was not an issue.     We stood in line waiting to get up to the counter.  We stood in line waiting to pay for our food.  There's no excuse for there to be 3 or 4 people on the line jumping over one another to fill orders when there is only 1 person at the cash register.  And about 95% of the time, the person at the cash register was also filing orders.    I think the people that work the food/customer line are in need of training.  Cause it was a total cluster-fuck.  And, if a customer's order is on hold cause what they want is being cooked, how about take the people that have a complete order and ring them up and get them out the door.    Thank goodness my next work meeting wasn't until 1pm.    I doubt I'll return.

LOVE LOVE LOVE The Family Birthing Suites at Scottsdale Osborn.  I checked in at 3 pm on June 10th - separate building from hospital.  After talking with the DR on call, we decided that the best course of action, for me and my son, was for me to have a c-section.    Baby C was born at 6:01pm.  8lb 10oz, 21inches long, Healthy, and Screaming!  LOL This birthing center is nice and private.  At most, there's 12 mamas on the floor.  Makes for lots of personal attention and you don't feel like just another number.    I will say that 95% of the staff was wonderful.  The 5% being the night shift staff I had my 2nd night.  TERRIBLE!  The Aid was pretty much nonexistent.  And well the RN on her first hour on shift, she's trying to "Help" my son nurse.  She's not only man-handling my boobs, but shoving my sons face into my tit.  Baby C is screaming and I'm getting frustrated.  Then the nurse starts in with her agenda - her formula pushing agenda.  My husband was ready to cave, but I told her to give us (my son and I) 5 minutes.  She left the room.  I was able to get Baby C calmed down and latched on.  Without shoving my boob into his face/mouth.  But that didn't stop her belittling my efforts.  All night long, I was beaten down with her formula pushing as Baby C was waking up every 2 or so hours to nurse.   I ignored her every time and said each time, "well his pediatrician (who had saw Baby C and I that first day) said that my body knows what to do, and I'm producing colostrum...which is all he needs right now.  My milk will come in in a few days.  And that I need to nurse to get my milk to come in."  This horrid nurse would always say, "he's hungry..that's why he's crying.  You should really give him formula."     Nurse Ratchet came in at 6am making her final rounds, and again I was nursing Baby C.  She finally says to me, "Well you're getting a lot of practice."  I seriously wanted to bitch slap this C You Next Tuesday.  After having little to no sleep, I lost it and started weeping.  She asked if I was alright and I said YUP.  She knew I had hit my breaking point and left.  I then began to sob uncontrollably.  I called my mom, who could bairly understand me over the sobs.  I called J, who also couldn't understand me.  But both made it a point to hurry up and get down to the Birthing Center.  Thankfully, the wonderful team I had my first day was back on shift.  The Aid came and said, as she walked in the door, "How's my superstar (I according to them had been an ideal patient...moving around the room, tending to baby, and walking the hall every few hours with Baby C...letting him get some sun from the skylights in the halls.  Apparently they have to practically drag other new moms out of bed.) this morning?!"  Then when she saw the emotional state I was in, "OMG are you alright?  What's wrong!?"  I cried on her shoulder for a good 20 minutes.  She reassured me and she said she would notify the nursing supervisor of what happened.  Baby C's pediatrician was making rounds and stopped by while the Aid was getting my vitals.  I addressed what happened over night, and said that if that nurse and aid was going to be back on shift, that I wanted to get Baby C and I discharged (if all my dr's approved).  Dr G. was outraged at what happened!!  She's pro-breastfeeding.  So Dr. G went and paid a visit to the nursing supervisor.  I was happy to hear that Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick were not going to be returning that evening.    My RN that day was Ruth.  OMG.  RUTH = AWESOME  She's been an RN for at least 50 years and her bedside manner proved it.  She's wonderful.  She knew I had a rough night and wanted Baby C and I to get a nice nap.  So she let me nurse C and came in a few minutes after we finished up, with a bottle of lotion.  Baby C was already asleep.  I'm tellin you, I got the best backrub of my life that morning.  And J said I was out like a light within minutes.    So there you have it.  From one end of the spectrum to the other.  Ruth vs. Nurse Ratchet.    The facility = 5 stars The staff = depends on who you get.   Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick Aid = Negative Stars The rest of the staff = 5+ Stars!  I'm going to go ahead and give 5 stars.

Had to rush Baby C over to CCMC on Sunday as he was having difficulty breathing.  We've been down the respiratory issue path with Baby C a few times.  That and I have my own asthma/allergy issues...so I know how to treat him.  When everything I had done in the past wasn't working (breathing treatments, steam shower, back to back treatments), I threw my hands up.  I knew my limitations and knew it was time to have him looked at.    The ER for Cardon's is in the same location as Banner Desert.  However, Peds is on one side and the other side is for non Ped patients.  Within minutes of walking in and checking in, Baby C was being rushed back, having vitals taken and getting a plan of action.    Thought he was going to have to be admitted, but we dodged that bullet.  The Dr and RT (actually all of the staff) that was looking after him were great.  Heck, one of the staff members even brought him in a toy to play with (wasn't sure if it was 100% clean, so I gave it a good wipe down first).  But seriously..how cool is that.  They made sure I had everything i needed while we were there - which was about 9 hours in total.  Did I need water?  No problem.  Needed to run to the restroom and have someone watch Baby C?  No problem.  Did I need something to nosh on?  Here, have some snacks.    Never do I want to step foot in a Children's Hospital.  BUT, if I have to, I'm going to make sure from now on it's Cardon Childrens Medical Center (we've been to PCH once - back in November..was not really a good experience).

I've been to Caps 2 times since they've opened.  Still a little sad that Schlotzskys is no longer.  Anyhow...A little pricey for a sandwich, but its a tasty sandwich.  And their small is 9inches, not like your subway 6inches.    Text "Caps104" to 25328 and you'll receive deals/discounts.  Just last week, I received a text stating it was buy an medium and receive a large sandwich.  Unfortunately, I already had lunch plans or else I would have asked one of my colleagues if they wanted to split a cheese steak.  :)

Those that are my Yelp friends know my addiction to Caps by my check-ins via the Yelp App.  LOL    Haven't tried any other sandwich but the cheese steak.  Why?  Cause the cheese steak is that awesome!  Get it with hot pepper, sweet pepper, and mushrooms ($1 extra for shrooms) - you wont be sorry!!  :)  If you haven't signed up for the Caps104 text (Text CAPS104 to 25328), and you are a patron of Caps, well then I shake my head at you!  You're missing out on tasty offers!!  :)

BIG BIG Thanks to the manager Henry and the rest of the guys at Water Heater Depot!!    I was searching on Craigslist for ceiling fans and ran across a posting for Water Heater Depot.  This place is seriously a great find!  It looks to be mostly scratch & dent, returns, and overstock from H/D.    We walk in and Henry greets us immediately and asks us what we're looking for.  We tell him we're needing a ceiling fan and he walks us over to the shelf they were on.  The only indoor ones left were missing parts.  BUT he thought he knew of one in another part of the shop.  He comes back with a fan that was a floor model with all parts still in the box.  Price - $35.  HD's price - $90.     I seriously know where we will be returning when we're ready to purchase items when we remodel!!  :)  We shall be back!!!

Cute little farmers market that is right in our neighborhood!!  We swung by after making a stop at sprouts.  I wanted to check it out and see what types of vendors were there.    It's definitely not PPM or GFM, but I didn't expect it to be.  All of the vendors were friendly and informative.  We ended up buying some Double Blessing Goat Milk Lotion...the stuff smells fantastic (purchased the Sandalwood Vanilla and Spiced Fig).  There was a grower there, and I wanted to buy a rosemary plant, but J suggested we don't buy anything until we get our garden situation sorted out in the next few months.  I should have purchased it anyway...I LOVE THE SMELL OF ROSEMARY!!  :)  We'll definitely be back to this market!  :)

At first I was a little saddened to learn that my former mechanic had up and sold the business at the drop of a hat.  BUT, I am pleased to report that Wilhelm (who's now at my mechanics old location) are a great group to work with.    From Devin and Jim at the front counter to the one mechanic that I've met.  They are all extremely friendly.    The first time I stopped in, it was just to swing by to see why my mechanics weren't answering the line.  That's when I found out the business had been sold.  Devin and Jim said that they'd be glad to have a look at what was wrong with The Beast.  I told them that I was having Fuel Pump issues and that just the month prior, the old shop couldn't get my extended warranty to cover it.  I explained what was happening and they said I could set up an appointment and have it looked at.    Well I wasn't able to get back in until almost 3 or so weeks later.  I called ahead of time and believe it or not, but Devin remembered me and the issue that was happening with The Beast.  I setup an appointment for the following morning.    I drop of The Beast at 7:30 and am given a ride back to the house (where I grab the car - J was driving my old pickup cause he knew I'd need the car).  I expect them to have the car for at least a day or two.  Much to my surprise, I receive a call a couple hours later stating that the warranty company approved the work order and that the part was being delivered.  I'd have The Beast back by that afternoon.  CRAZY!  They also looked at the window regulator, which the warranty company wouldn't cover for some reason, and did a LOF.  I told Devin that I'd be at the house by 4pm and he arranged for me to be picked up again.    Fast and Friendly Service.  Gotta Love It!

The C-Clan went to Sit-Stay on grand opening night.  We got there just in time as we took 2 of the last seats at the community table.  The wait was the better part of 1hr to get in afterwards.     We decided to order some corndog bites (though J wanted to order the Scotch Eggs) as a starter.  Mini versions of the jalapeno cheese corndogs...drool!    J's order - The Mac Daddy, which he raved about!  My order - A salad for which I can not remember the name.  Had grilled peaches, chicken sausage, and 2 slices of fried goat cheese.  Perhaps it was the Sunny?  Salad dressing was pretty non-existent.  Though the dog was flavorful, I probably wouldn't order the salad again.      Baby Cs order - Kids polka dot casserole.  A penne pasta with a cheese sauce and slices of hot dog.  Baby C enjoyed the pasta and bites of dog.    Other than my salad, the only thing that would make Sit/Stay better is if they had high chairs.  Baby C had to sit in my lap because unfortunately they only have booster seats.  Baby C is a too small for a booster.  And there's a big difference between going to a restaurant and having a 13month old sit in my lap vs visiting the truck at the Phoenix Public Market and having the baby lap it.   So hopefully they'll have a highchair or two by the time we go again, or maybe we'll just bring our travel highchair.  But all in all, it was a great experience!  We don't have to stalk, er, chase the food truck for our dog fix!  YAY!

This review is for the event, not the trucks.  We love the trucks!!    We stopped by the FTC the other Saturday to grab some viddles.  They start around 7:30, so the heat of the day has already started to die off a little bit.  Still warm out though.  Thankfully, they have misting stations up, which helps a little bit.  Hopefully, when the weather cools off a bit and the sun starts to set earlier in the next month or two, they'll change the event time to earlier in the evening..say starting at 5pm.  Only makes sense, right?    The Saturday we went, it was pretty crowded.  We were afraid we wouldn't be able to find a seat for the 3 of us.  Thankfully, we were able to squeeze in at a table.   So HEADS UP to the coordinators, more tables/seating please!!  Not everyone just eats and skedaddles.  People stick around.  I mean, this weekly event is meant to be a gathering of people to come eat and socialize, right?  Otherwise, whats the point in having a band?      We'll give it another try since it is right in our backyard.  But I think we'll have our camping table and chairs handy..just in case we cant find seating.

No longer will J and I have to chase down the Pie Truck for Mamma T's tasty mini pies.  Well, I'm sure we still will!  But Mamma Toledos'  now has a brick and mortar open on Roosevelt Row.  Tucked away in a room adjacent to Short Leash's Sit..Stay, you can have your pie and eat it too (right after you eat your dog that is)!    Mamma has a case filled with full size pies, ranging from her Banana Cream and Raspberry Cheesecake to Apple and Blueberry.  You can buy by the slice or heck buy a whole pie!  I saw at least one person walking out with a huge pie box last night at the grand opening.  :)    J and I each grabbed a slice to go - J's a slice of apple. And I got a slice of blueberry.  Tasty?  But of course!    Sometime here in the future you'll be able to buy a slice/pie...out of a hole..err..window!  A walkup window that is.  That kinda set-up reminds me of some of the food joints back in NYC with walk up windows.  So if you hankering for a slice, head on down to Roosevelt Row and stop by The Pie Hole!  She bakes Pies Motherf!@#er!  ;)

(My Mobile Tip) Wow. These guys are seriously friendly! I have like 4 different menus to take back to work.    I ordered the lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki Box - $7.25.  You get a lot of food for the price you pay!    The chicken teri was not overly sweet or breaded.  The dumplings (goyza) or some may refer to this as potstickers, were steamed/pan fried.  J would have loved them.  I'm not really a big fan of potstickers.  The sauce was not the traditional scallion dipping sauce, but a soy citrus sauce.  Standard fare with the california roll and veg tempura.  I will say that the tempura was not greasy, which was a good thing.  And the house salad came with an awesome ginger dressing.    When I got back to work and started eating at my desk, I had quite a few colleagues ask where I went and that it smelled fantastic.  I'll have to admit, I did "stink" up the area.  It smelled awesome!    OH - I noticed that they have high chairs in their restaurant, so that tells me that the place is toddler friendly.  Which for a mom, that is very important.  Not always can you find a babysitter.    I'm sure J, Little C, and I will stop by one evening for an early supper.  :)

Pretty much echoing the same gripes as the other reviewers.    Parking was horrid.  Getting in was alright as we got there before the festival opened.  Getting out was another thing all together.  I drive a tall SUV, so after sitting in a line for 10 minues, I decided to off-road it to get out.    The balloons were all handing out cheap candy.  And the ones that werent, or werent out of candy, had lines that were very long.    All in all, there wasnt a lot for kids to do - Radio Disney booth aside.  The only positives were - 1) a friend of ours had her vendor booth set up there. So we got to see her.  2) I purchased a Groupon for 2-4-1 admission.  Thank goodness.  I dont think that I would have been happy paying full price.   This year, I was going to buy another groupon/living social deal.  BUT they originally only had the deals for Friday.  Then they opened up the option for Saturday for Groupon only, with ticket sales being limited.  By the time i went to buy the saturday groupon, it was already sold out.    Guess we'll be going to Howl-O-Ween at the Phx Zoo this year instead.  I have a feeling our money will be money well spent at the zoo.

Stopped off at this new Chipotle location last night before picking up Little C from daycare.  From the outside, you'd never know that this location is open for business.  Unlike Smashburger next door, they do not have a sign along Scottsdale Rd stating they're "Now Open".    Standard Chipotle fare.  All of the workers seem very enthusiastic to be working there.  And were very friendly.  I'll more than likely return to this location as it is easier to grab and go (if we're not cooking dinner) before picking up Little C than going to the 44th/Thomas location after picking him up.

Brand spanking new CFA in the Arcadia area!! Location is a little cramped, but they've handled the traffic flow..making the only entrance off 44th street.   Typical CFA food - tasty chicken and poly sauce Always exceptional customer service. :)

So, I no longer like the regular chick-fil-a sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty sandwich.  But, I'm a Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich girl for good!    And however they make their diet lemonaide....it's like crack.  It takes everything for me to not drive there daily and get a lemonaide.  So good!!

I don't know what's up with this location, but the order accuracy (via the drive-thru) has gone in the crapper!  Not once.  Not twice.  But the last FIVE times has our order been wrong (which a few of the times we discovered after we got home)!    The manager has tried to make amends by giving food vouchers.  Doing this is great if your workers make mistakes every once in a while.  But the fact that this has happened the last 5 times tells me that this is happening to A LOT of customers.  And J and I cant be the only customers that have voiced our displeasure.  Which means that they're giving out a lot of free food cause the people (kids) behind the counter cant get their act together.   I think I'll stick to just getting lemonade from here for a while.  Though I may not ever do that as they even almost screwed THAT up last week.    I order 2 lemonades - 1 diet and 1 regular. The girl at the window tries giving me 1 lemonade and 1 dr pepper.  I tell her I didnt order a dr pepper.  She says, are you sure?  I have to show her my receipt (that she had just handed me not even 30 seconds prior) and prove to her I ordered 2 lemonades and not a soda and lemonade.  SMH  FAIL!!!  Funny - All the times we've gone to the Riverview CFA, we have never had an issue with order accuracy.  Maybe we'll just have to start going back to that location.  And seeing as it is at least a 15 minute trip, we'll end up saving $$$ by not having the convenience going to the one that's in our backyard.

Rude! Sitting in the drive thru and the girl on mic needs a lesson in manners.  I had a coupon and asked if I could pay the difference between the chicken deluxe sandwich and the spicy chicken deluxe...  which I've done numerous times in the past at that location. her response to me in an abrupt tone, "No!" Uhh..okay I've done so in the past. "No you can't." I ask to speak to a manager.  the manager informed me there's been a change in policy and you can only get what item is stated on the coupon. Okay that makes sense why I can't just pay the difference between the two items. What would have been appreciative is if the girl would have explained that there was a change in policy instead of just saying NO, with no explanation. the manager then says thank you and I sit there waiting to order a kids meal for little C and nobody comes back on the mic. thankfully the kid at the window was nice enough to let me complete my order and he got everything out to me really fast.   Aside from the health benefits, I am reminded of yet another reason why I do not eat fast food anymore (J wanted CFA).

I am back at my desk at work writing this review after leaving this place, that's how irritated I am.  The hours say they're open at 11am, so since i work less than 2 minutes away, i decide to use my 30minute lunch to go over and look for some new frames.  This place is covered by my insurance and I get an allotment to use towards frames.  Having champaigne taste (my present frames cost more than my mortgage payment), I figured $150 off a nice pair of frames and paying the difference would be a nice change of pace to my pocketbook when it came to glasses.    I head over a little after 11:30 and find the shop is locked, with the Be Right Back sign (brb @ 12) posted in the window.  The place hadnt even been open 1 hour, and whomever was manning it had to leave/take a break/whatever?!  So I wander around and check out a few shops next door.    I head back a little after 12noon.  Yup still locked.  So I have a seat next door and wait.  Almost 10 minutes after noon, and see this lady casually strolling down the street with what looked like a shopping bag in tote.  She makes eye contact with me, and she proceeds to unlock the door.  I walk in after her.  No sorry to keep you waiting. Nothing.  Simply with an attitude,  "Can I help you?"  Me - Yes, I'm looking to replace my frames.   Her - Do you have insurance?   Me - (not that that matters) Yes, I do.  Her - Here's everything that your VSP will cover - points to the table.  She hands me 3 pairs of frames, which totally looked like shit on, and that was it.  She then jumped on the phone to try to verify someone's insurance.    Seeing she'd rather be on the phone verifying coverage than help a customer, along with the lackluster inventory, I walked out.  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.   I'll take my money back to my regular eyeglass shop in Phoenix, which isn't covered by my VSP.

Don't come here hungry for breakfast.  Cause they do NOT have their sh*t together.  Stood in line while the guy tried to figure out how to work the register for like 30 minutes.  It was between the Chipotle style place the next stall over, or this place.  And neither were moving people through the line.  With a hungry toddler, you can imagine how fun THAT was..waiting to just order food.    The food was mediocre.  We ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches - one with sausage and one with steak.  Honestly, I could have made the same thing at home. And better.  So save your money and eat before you arrive (which we intended on doing, but every restaurant in the area was packed).

JJ's just opened here in Old Town yesterday.  I stopped by during lunch (just a quick walk across the street) to grab some grub.  My first visit EVER to a JJ's.  I was surprised - Fast (like SUPER FAST), cheap, and decent proportions.    I'll be back!  :)

This location doesn't really seem like a true Clean Freak, like the 44th street location, but more like a gas station car wash. You're in and out of the tunnel within like 2 minutes if not less, it's the shortest Clean Freak tunnel I've been in to date. No air hoses and maybe 6 stalls for to vacuum the inside of your vehicle. I'll keep going to 44th street.

Decent carwash. A lot better than the Via De Venturea location.  Wish they had the air hoses though like they do at 44th street.  That's the only thing missing.

Great burgers, but towards the end - lackluster service.  We never got refills on our drinks. Had to remind the server after getting out bill that we were due the $2 facebook check-in deal for the chicken strips we ordered.  He then disappeared to go find the manager, who was standing at the bar. I would go back, but would hope that we would get a different server.

Went here at 730 Mother's Day morning because I saw their orchid corsage special on Facebook the night before. Pretty good deal. $12 (approx.) for 2 orchid corsages.  Had wished they were wrist corsages, but that was okay. I gave one to my mom and kept the other for myself. I am a mommy after all to Little C! :D  After reading a few review, I now see that I was in the Flower Shop part of the business and not the Flower Market.  Next time I'm in the mood for fresh flowers at work or at the house, I'll have to go check out the "market" part of the business.    Side note - Almost 3 weeks later, my orchid is still alive in the container in my fridge.  :D

We had tickets to the 10am experience.  Should have just gotten a refund when our original tickets (12/13) were canceled. That was a cluster-f in itself with Ticketmaster and our original tickets.   $10 parking that you don't find out until you get to the dirt lot you park in. Couldn't bring in stroller for our 2.5 year old. The registration keyosks, about 60% were broken. Probably because those tablets cannot be in the sun. Whoever planned the setup didn't think that one through. A full canopy rather than an awning for the trailers, would have prevented the registration process fiasco. That and there was no sight of IT (though the staff knew there was an issue) until people started complaining loudly.  Stood around waiting at least 30 minutes to reregister (cause it wasn't recognizing our userid/pass we set up online). The quinjet area broke down and we ended up waiting in the "hangar" for 40 minutes. The 3d dome area had problems, so we weren't able to use the 3d glasses. Couldn't experience the 4d ride cause of height limitations, which we weren't informed about until we were in the room. Not very young child (5 and under) friendly as there wasn't a lot that my son was able to participate in.    Though i didnt know what to expect, i was not prepared for this huge of a disappointment. Very VERY unhappy with the experience!!!

After sending an email via the Marvel Experience site, I received an email expressing apologies and offering return tickets or a refund.     IMO, the groups that experienced the severe tech difficulties, should have been approached by management before we left the "experience".  That probably would have saved a lot of the negative reviews.  For the apologies and return/refund tickets, they get an additional star.

Terrible inside setup.  You're practically elbow to elbow with the next customer that's being helped at the same table. So forget about privacy. No real line to wait in.  No deposit/withdrawal slips. Trying to withdrawal a decent amount of cash does not go unnoticed by other customers, because you're cash is being counted for all to see. And the "lobby" entrance is right next to Van Buren.  I think I'll stick to my Scottdale branch.

Dr. Kelsch is the Doctors' Doctor!    The first of 2 surgeries completed (first one done 2/24), and the before and after difference with breathing through my nose - AMAZING!  Dr. Kelsch tells you right from the start wether you're an good canidate for whatever procedure you'll be getting done.  Finding an ENT that gets to the point, and doesn't try to gouge onces pocketbook or insurance for that matter, it's refreshing!!  Oh how I wish I would have found Dr. Kelsch and Valley ENT LAST YEAR!!  I would have saved time and money in the long run.    1 procedure down - 1 to go!  :)

If Grimaldi's or Rosati's got together with Chipotle and had a baby...it would be Fired Pie!   I tried fire pie for the first time this past Saturday at the Northsite location. I immediately was dumbfounded at the fact that nobody had thought of this concept up until recently. So now I have been to fire pie twice, with this location being visited today for lunch. Yes I enjoyed it that much that I went and had fire by again but two days later. Lol  Fresh ingredients, your pie or salad custom made right in front of your face, and seriously fast service / cooking time. Both times I have the steak and blue, crispy, and easy on the oil and garlic.    Yup, I have found a new lunch time spot to add to the rotation! :)

The plan the other Saturday night was to go get burgers from In & Out and bring them back to the house.  However, due to events taking place around ASU that night and the next day (ASU Homecoming and some race the next day), I was unable to get off on Scottsdale road.  And all of the surrounding streets were closed too.  BIG Cluster F.    After sitting in traffic for almost an hour trying to get back to the 202, I get back to Hayden/McClintock road.  I see the new Portillo's and give J a quick call to see if that was an okay substitute for him, to which it was.   They have a drive-thru which is nice and if it is during a peak time, they have people standing outside waiting to take your order instead of ordering at the squakbox (like In&Out).  If you've never been though, you feel pressed to make a quick meal decision - Which I was for mine and  C's meals as J had checked out their menu online and texted me his order.    I ordered 2 chili cheese dogs, a regular hot dog, the poppyseed fruit with chicken salad, and an order of fries.  I found it odd that they do not have kids meals at Portillo's.  I will say that C liked the hot dog.  But to be honest, I could just buy a package of Nathan's Famous and make these dogs at home (chili and chicago).  J felt the same way about his chili dogs (which ended up falling apart).  And the fries, I could order the same fries at Del Taco for the same price.  Or better yet, make them at home.    The salad I ordered sounded similar to the Strawberry poppyseed seasonal (summer only) salad I fell in love with at Paradise.  BOY was I wrong.  The chicken resembled flash frozen chicken.  You know the kind you can get in the freezer section, you just reheat it and use as you like.  Terrible.  The only positive thing about the salad was the cheese (which there was only a sprinkle of) and fruit, which I ended up sharing with C.   The glazed walnuts, there were maybe 4 or 5 pieces in my salad.  OH..they gave you a lemon poppy muffin with the salad.  Big Whoop.    For the price we paid ($20+), we were all in all disappointed in our dinner and probably wont be returning.

Went here last night for drinks after finishing up our day at comicon.  The a/c must have been broken because it was miserable inside. Did notice they had a fan up towards the door. Service was good, but it being cooler outside than inside was a laugh.

This was today's truck for food truck Thursday at work. Was on the fence to go down and order,  but am glad i did! Had the Godfather. Pretty tasty sandwich consisting of Genoa Salami, Spicy Capicolla, Black Forest Ham, Melted Mozzarella, Roasted Red Peppers, Peppercinis and house made Garlic basil Mayo. Was not overly salty like one would assume.  I'll be glad to order from them again if they end up in the rotation on Thursdays.

New business nestled in the office building, with an entrance in the courtyard behind the Marriott suites! No outside signage yet, but it's in the same location as was Pacific's. Same location, but completely remodeled! From furnishings to menu.    Just opened, I believe today, and business is booming already.. Had the bacon and blue burger. Nice size burger. Cooked perfectly. Crispy bacon. All in all, very good!   I know my colleagues and I will make this a regular breakfast and lunch stop!
