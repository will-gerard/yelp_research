Pretty average breakfast spot, but they get the 4th star from me because their bran muffins are out of control!! I like how you can substitute your side with a fresh baked muffin. Cut that muffin in half and melt a little butter into it and every single bite will melt in your mouth. Good Lord!!

I went in for an oil change today, at about 1:00pm on a Saturday - very poor planning on my part. But the guys there did not give me any frustration about it at all; they told me my car would be done in about a half hour and they were true to their word.   Nivaro was the name of the guy who helped me and he was awesome. He even washed my windows and my front windshield was absolutely disgusting. Some bird bombed my car really bad...no seriously it was bad. Anyway he cleaned it up for me and didn't complain at all. They were quick and gave excellent customer service. They even held the door for me and thanked me for coming in while another guy there pulled my car up for me.   I will definitely be getting my oil changed there from now on!! I highly recommend this business and location.

I give this place between 3-4 stars... 3 would be because of the service there... it's not the greatest but it's decent.  I rounded my review up to 4 stars because of the alcohol selection. The bar has an impressive selection of both liquors and liqueurs that you don't often see at a typical bar. It is nice to see businesses making drinks other than standard margaritas and vodka/crans. Every single specialty drink I have ever ordered from here was smooth and tasty. They also have a pretty decent Scotch selection which is fairly priced as well.   Furthermore, the pizza is good although pricey... the white pizza is delicious and the basil really stands out on it. The standard cheese pizza that you can order by the slice really lacks any kind of wow factor though. If you order pizza from here, you should definitely order a whole pizza and ditch the by the slice option completely.   Overall very cool place. I'd recommend going on a Saturday night when they have live music.

Don't waste your time going here.  I just went to this location on Wednesday 03/25 and I paid $16.35 for a package to be sent from Chandler, AZ to Tucson, AZ.  I was sending a special package to my friend whose birthday is this Saturday 03/28.  I was told with this shipping method that she would receive the package on Thursday 03/26.  I was impressed with how fast they could ship it for me, but then again the drive from Chandler to Tucson is only a 2 hour drive max.  I also received a tracking number and I was supposed to get an email notification as soon as she received her birthday package.  I did not get one yesterday 03/27 when it was supposed to be delivered.  I thought maybe 1 day was too fast, even though I paid an excessive amount for that to happen.  So I log on to UPS website this morning and lo and behold, my package is in California and isn't scheduled to arrive to my friend until maybe Monday 03/30 end of day.  WHY IS MY PACKAGE IN ANOTHER STATE????  I contacted UPS via the live assistance online and the rep has been NO HELP whatsoever to me.  "LaRisa G." is her name.  I explained my problem to her and all she replied back was "I'm sorry you have experienced problems with this shipment" and offered me no solutions to my problem at all, nor a refund.  When I asked her what she was going to do to solve my problem, she replied back "Feedback such as yours allows us to continually improve our services."  What kind of a response is this????   I continued to ask her questions to try and fix my issue, never swore at her once or anything, kept my cool the whole time, and then she told me she did not have any solutions for me and disconnected our chat.  I am appalled at the service I have received from UPS and will NEVER give them any business ever again, and will make sure to spread the word so that no one else gets treated like this or has this happen to them too.

I love this place and I love the lake view from the patio. The only reason this appt doesn't get 4 stars is bc parking is so bad here. Smallest lot ever that you awkwardly have to back out of if there are no open parking spaces.

I have been to this restaurant twice and was not at all impressed my first visit. I would've given this spot 2 stars based on that visit. The service was just okay and the sushi was very bland and not cold enough.   My 2nd visit was significantly better. The service still was not good, however the sushi was much better. The Citrus Roll was excellent and I highly recommend trying that roll.   My boyfriend and I were sat in the back room on this visit and it was nice in that room - minus the creepy painting on the wall of a torture room or something?? That painting is hideous and grosses me out. It looks like a room from a Saw movie. Who wants to looks at that while they eat raw fish?  Anyway, the 2nd visit was much better but still I'm not sure if I will be back. I hate it when restaurants are inconsistent in regards to their food. Service I can understand, but I think the food should always be consistent.

I just left from here and I am absolutely appalled at the service I received today from the front desk staff. I came to pick up my contacts which were already paid for, so it should've been a quick in/out experience.  This was not the case.   The front desk girl was so unprofessional. When she greeted me she asked for my date of birth and name. I gave this to her and she looked me up. I told her I have contacts waiting for me and she said okay and wrote down a tray number on a piece of paper, then continued to type in her computer.   I thought she was working on something for my file, then I realized she was entering in data from a packet (another patient's info). I stood in front of her and waited, as she continued entering in info from this packet, even turning the page to enter in another full page of info. Another girl walked up to her and then she said "oh hey can you get this for me?" I had already been standing in front of her for at least 5 solid minutes by this time. The 2nd girl came back in about 20 seconds with my contacts.  I then decided I wouldn't be back so I asked for my prescription. The whole ordeal had me in there for 15-20 min when it has always been about a 2 minute experience before.   I won't be back because my time is not respected and I was not valued as a customer.   I did like my Dr, who I believe his name is Dan. He is always a pleasure. But the front desk staff does not treat patients in a respectable manner.

I love this Best Buy. I have never had a negative experience here, but just this past week I had an amazing experience in this store that compelled me to write a review as a thank you.   My boyfriend and i just purchased an X-Box One from this location (bundle pack) and we have really loved the console. He plays games on it and we also use it for Netflix and other apps too.  Unfortunately we received a defective controller and needed to exchange it. We didn't want to repackage the whole console if we didn't have to, so we just brought our controller and the receipt down to the store to see if that would be adequate for the exchange.   The associate who started helping us was unsure of what to do, so he called over a manager, who I believe her name was Casey. She was extremely professional and was so customer-focused - it was so pleasant dealing with her. She quickly found a solution and helped us out, without ever making us feel like we were inconveniencing her or causing them trouble. Within 7-8 minutes of talking to her, we already had a new controller and were on our way.   I would never have expected such great customer service, especially during the holiday season when I'm sure so many retailers are burnt out and get a ton of returns.   Needless to say we will only be shopping at Best Buy, particularly this location from now on. Thank you so much for the incredible service!!!!

I was just in here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and my experience was just atrocious.  It was a nice day out so we wanted to sit out on the patio.  We sat ourselves at a small high top table next to the bar.  We should've known to leave when no one greeted us or brought us menus after we had been seated for about 5 minutes.  It looked like business was steady, but by no means were they busy or understaffed.    We finally got menus and we ordered drinks and an appetizer to start with.  It took quite a while to get our drinks, which sat on the bar counter for quite some time.  My boyfriend ordered a whiskey ginger, but whatever was brought out was definitely not that.  I know some bars try to make their own gingerale, but this was nowhere close.  It tasted like a whiskey sour - with a TON of sour.  We are talking margarita amounts.  We sent it back and he ordered a different drink instead.  We had probably been sitting at our table for close to 20 minutes before even ordering our main meal, and that was not due to us not knowing what we wanted.  Right before our sushi arrived, a wine bottle dropped off of a table about 20 feet away from our table, and I was shocked at how many employees just sat there gawking and how long it took before someone finally walked over there to help this lady with her broken bottle of wine.  All the employees sat around the server station (really close to us) and just kept huddling together and talking about it.  Really inappropriate.  Our sushi came roughly about 5 minutes after the wine ordeal.  The employee who dropped it off at our table was so eager to go talk to other employees about what had happened that they didn't even care to ask us if we needed anything else, or to notice that we did not have any utensils or chop sticks at our table to eat our meal with.  We had to flag someone down to even start eating our meal.  The sushi was sub-par but I had already expected that.  The 2nd star on this review is because the spinach artichoke dip was delicious.  If not for that I would've given this place 1 star.

I just moved out to the Chandler/Gilbert area and I am glad to have Teakwoods close by. I love the feel inside the bar and the drinks are good. The food is really hit and miss.  I would give this place 3 stars, however they do have trivia nights which have been really fun so it bumped up the place to 4 stars.   I do recommend this place for drinks and trivia, not really the food. I will be returning for sure.

I just left from this place after they asked my aunt to leave because she had a small 5lb well behaved, non-shedding dog with her.   Her dog was not causing any issues and was welcomed by all the bowlers in the tournament. She was not loud, running around, chewing on anything, etc. She was simply sitting in my aunts lap.  They do not have any sort of "no dogs allowed" signage on the front entrance or around the building. In fact, I read through ALL the Safety and House Rules on their website, and they are very specific in how their facility is to be used, and what items are prohibited (with very strong emphasis on alcohol and firearms/weapons rules); there is not a single mention of animals of any type, and especially no mention of well behaved, clean, non-shedding, non-barking 5 lb dogs.  My aunt wasn't even sitting at a table as there was no seating available for her and she had to sit on the ground.   Very disappointed in how they handled this today and their total disregard for my aunt's comfort and how she had to sit on the ground.   I do not recommend this place to anyone, not only based on the dog situation despite lack of rules concerning the matter, but also based on the staffing amd their poor judgement.

This food is so delicious. I wish there was one in the east valley!!!!  I highly recommend the zeljanica which is so tender inside and flaky outside...   Also the lepinja with the red bell pepper sauce is to die for.   The prices are pretty cheap and the food is flavorful and traditional. I would eat here every week at LEAST if there was one in Chandler.   Furthermore, the service is top notch and you will be well cared for...very hospitable staff. The last time I ate here the woman who served us also gave me a chocolate Milka bar for free as I was leaving. They are so beyond nice at this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love this place!!  The customer service is fantastic and the employees are soo knowledgeable about the origin of the food, etc.  I am highly impressed every time I have questions and they tell me the answers without hesitation.  I really like the Victor dog food in the purple bag.  I used Natural Balance before but I become hesitant of it after the Venison food was recalled.  They recommended Victor to me at this feed store, and my dogs love it.  One of my babies has a super sensitive stomach and he has always had to have his own separate food.  He can now eat the Victor dry food just like my other babies and has no problems.  I am so thankful they recommended such a great food to me, as it makes things so much simpler now.  Also every time I go, this really nice guy who works there always carries the food out to my car for me.  I struggle with a 40lb bag a little, but it is nice that they automatically do this for you there.  Wonderful store and I would recommend it to everyone!

This used to be one of my favorite Thai restaurants until my most recent experience a couple months ago...  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EVER EVER EVER ORDER THE FISH CAKES APPETIZER.  Please take my advice and you will thank me later.   These fish cakes sounded so delicious on the menu but when they came out, it was a whole different story... when I think of fish cakes, crab cakes, etc, I think of fluffy, flavorful, tender, puffy, etc. These things were small, rubbery, highly compacted little discs of who knows what. They looked disgusting and the taste was one hundred times worse than the appearance. They tasted like what I imagine Pledge tastes like. Yes the cleaning solution, Pledge. What we were brought was so highly unacceptable to be served ANYWHERE. It was like something that would be featured on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. I lost all respect for this restaurant after this experience...even though my entree tasted fine. I don't think i will be back.

This is a great spot for Thai food. It is so delicious and the portions are a good size. It is priced very fairly.   The Cashews and Vegetables dish with tofu is incredible - ever since I tried this dish I can't get enough of it. The Pad Thai is good too, but the Cashews and Vegetables definitely kills that dish.   The service here is great. My water never gets low as the lady who always helps us is extremely attentive - but not annoying attentive. It is just right.   Sometimes they bring out the dishes one at a time which I don't like (I'd rather have everyone's plate come out at the same time), but I will live with it in exchange for the service, prices, and food quality I receive every time I go there.   Definitely recommend this spot for anyone craving Thai!!

I am so thankful for finding this place!!!!  My dog Scout got a nasty gash on his arm that another vet said would "close on it's own" (way wrong).  VCA got me in quick and they were very reasonably priced.  On our 1st visit they discussed options with me and we decided on the best route to take for Scout.  We made an appt for his 2nd visit, in which he needed to have a small surgery and the gash sutured shut, and then a semi-cast was put on after his surgery.  I dropped Scout off around 7:45am for his 8:00am surgery, and they said I could pick him up anytime after 1:00pm, or I could even leave him there until I got off of work (at no extra charge).  I was a little nervous to leave him in their care all day, but I soon realized he was in good hands when they sent me a text message letting me know he was awake from his anesthesia and that it went very smoothly.  Shortly after that, they even sent me a picture of him when he was able to walk around and go outside for a potty break.  It put all my worries to rest, and rightly so.  When I picked him up, they told me all about his day and a few funny things he did, which was very reassuring to know that the staff all got to know him and that they treated him so well.  I absolutely love this place.  Scout had a couple more follow up visits to make sure he was recovering well and that his wound was healing nicely.  Typically the vets I have used in the past have charged me around $55-60 per visit, but at VCA they waived the initial exam fee because Scout was a new patient, and the only thing I was charged was for the surgery and pain meds (which amounted to around $300-350? - very reasonable pricing).  I was not charged for a single follow up visit so for a surgery, anesthesia, sutures, all day care on surgery day, pain meds, and 4 visits total, plus incredible care from the staff and updates throughout surgery day, I would say that this place is a treasure and would recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!  Thank you so much VCA staff - I greatly appreciate the way that you treated Scout and he has healed so well thanks to you!!!!  I will be taking all my dogs here for regular exams and annual vaccinations, etc.

Don't waste your money going to this place...it is a dump.  We went last night and took our 3 nephews to play.  So 3 small kids and 3 adults - $115.  Pretty pricey, but still we decided to pay and play.  We had a lot of trouble with our lanes.  The pins kept resetting when there was still the 2nd try left.  It made it difficult for the kids to know which ones to try and knock down.  We had to use the "reset" button frequently because at times the pins that were knocked down weren't moved out of the way for the 2nd try.  When we brought up the issue with one of the staff members, she made it seem like we didn't know how to bowl and disregarded our issues.  UH, we know how to bowl and we know how a lane should function.  It's not difficult science, and it should not be that challenging for 3 kids to throw some balls down a lane and for it to function properly.  Her lack of concern was really off-putting.  At one point, our balls weren't returned to us.  4 bowling balls should not take more than 8 minutes to circulate back to us.  Additionally, we ordered 2 pizzas, a small side of wings, and a pitcher of beer, which set us back another $75.  Absolutely ridiculous.  We took a little bit of time for the kids to eat, and by doing so, apparently we ran out of time on our lanes, and our games just stopped.  I would definitely NOT recommend coming to this bowling alley.  It was not worth our $190, especially with all the issues with the lanes which ate up our time, which in turn contributed to us running out of time on our lanes and not being able to finish more than 2 1/2 games.  It was extremely disappointing, and the customer services was atrocious.  I will never take my family here again, and advise you to check out other bowling alleys as well.

I was not impressed with anything I have had here and probably will not return. The sushi rolls were small and left a sort of weird aftertaste in my mouth. Everything was just okay.

I was pleasantly surprised with how good the sushi was here. I enjoy the lunch specials from time to time and I always make sure to get a rainbow roll when I go. The fish used for the sushi is good quality and has a nice taste. The edamame are good too and taste fresh, not microwaved like at a lot of places. The service is good and they bring you your food in a timely manner. It is a good spot for lunch with friends or for business. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Just ate here a few weeks ago following a recommendation from a friend. Was not disappointed!!  The owners of this place are very kind and you can tell they take pride in what they do. The atmosphere is upscale, although it is a little quieter than I'd prefer. Everything in the restaurant is high quality, from the tables and chairs, to the plates and utensils, to the decor around the building.   The food was excellent. I ordered my favorite dish - tikki masala with tofu, and it was delicious. The flavors were hearty and deep. The rice was cooked perfectly. Very nice meal.   It is a little pricey but the food and service make up for it. Also it would be nice to have a little bit more parking available; if there are no spots available up front there is a lot around back. It looks a little sketchy but it seems to be a safe place to park your car.   I would definitely recommend this place as I had a great meal there and I will come back again soon!

This place is pretty cool for a night when you just want to grab a quick bite to eat. It is definitely not a beautiful restaurant by any means and would not make for a romantic date spot.   HOWEVER the food is really good. The Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew are my favorites there. I like how there is crushed peanuts on top of the Pad Thai here. Not every place does that which is a shame because I feel like it makes a huge difference with that dish.   I was very impressed with the man who always serves us there, who I am assuming is the Owner. He is typically the only person working there. He takes the orders, cooks the food, serves the tables, and cleans up after. All the while my beverage is always full. Just amazing service there. I am happy to support local businesses like that who really take care of their guests and put out quality food as well!!

This place was pretty cool. Being a dog lover I definitely was a sucker for all the cool dog art on the walls as well as customers dogs on the TV. It was an awesome atmosphere. There are definitely beers for every taste there and the flights are awesome. My only beef with this place was that they don't have a food menu, although they do have free popcorn there and I believe they allow you to bring in your own snacks. That is a pretty awesome fix, although I wish I had known before I went there bc I probably would've stayed longer otherwise. Next time I will be sure to eat before hand or bring my own snacks =)

This place was great. I ate there for the first time the other day and I was very happy with my breakfast burrito selection. It was not too much food, just right. I was also excited that you can add hash browns to your burrito for $1. The coffee is really great too!

This is truly one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Valley. I have started reviews on this place several times before, but don't post it because I feel like my review doesn't do this place the justice they deserve. Well today I am probably still not going to be able to accurately describe how amazing this place is, but I want to give them my 5 stars already!!  India Oven is such a great treat and I have NEVER once been disappointed in this restaurant. As much as I frequent here, it bewilders me that the food has never let me down. And I know it won't - they are so consistent here.   I hate buffets, but this is not your average buffet. The food is of the highest quality and you can tell it is authentic and that so much care went into its creation. It is so savory and the spices are always perfect. I love how there is a separation of vegetarian dishes from meat dishes, and there is an equal number of each to choose from. The prices are fair and the staff is great. I have never once had an empty cup of water while dining here. The waiters are the most professional here than I have seen anywhere else before. They are kind, respectful, attentive, yet they never come over too much or interrupt your meal by trying to start conversation that they don't actually care about. They are amazing, just like the food.   Please give this place a shot as you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place has average sushi,  although the Cougar Rolls are very different and delicious. The service here is always just okay.   Make sure you don't sit by the windows here - you will be pestered by fruit flies your entire meal. This place has tons of them and it is disgusting. They are the worst in the corner window seats. I wish this place would do something about them...

This place has such delicious food and I have never had a bad experience there. The cheese naan is out of this world good - it is light and flavorful and just the right combination of crispy outside and soft inside. I love that there are so many meatless options.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because every time I go, the water is constantly running in the women's bathroom. It never shuts off, and that bothers me. I hate wasting resources and for the water to ALWAYS run - that is a bit excessive to me  please fix your sink so I can update this review and change the rating to 5 stars!! Thank you!!

My boyfriend and I ate here last night - it was phenomenal.  I had several small plates including the albacore which practically melted in my mouth; the slice of apple gave it a nice crunch and contrasting tartness. Next was the grilled mozzarella plate which tasted balanced and fresh, with just the right amount of balsamic and basil. Then came the snapper plate; this plate had a chunk of tender snapper fish drizzled with some kind of savory sauce. Every single plate was well put together and so carefully flavorful.   We ended the meal with the orange olive oil cake. It wasn't very sweet and focused more on the natural taste of the olive oil, pistachios, and orange. If you are in the mood for dessert but aren't into super sweet items, this is definitely for you. It was very unique and enjoyable.   During the meal I had a drink called the "Dazed and Infused" which was very lovely. The base was a sparkling white wine; it was light and refreshing, and looked beautiful as it was garnished with a strawberry slice. Wonderful summer drink.   The service was great and the restaurant demonstrated a simple yet sophisticated look.   I had a great experience here tonight and would definitely pay them another visit. It is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are looking for something classy for a special occasion.

I have been here twice recently and enjoyed both times. I had the avocado eggs Benedict and it is cooked very nicely... the service is good. I would definitely recommend breakfast from here. On a side note, the water glasses are huge which I love so even when they are busy you never run out of water. Nice little spot!!

This place is okay. The sushi is very average and the service is a little confusing at times. I worry about the sushi on the rotating conveyer belt...I feel that sometimes it stays out for too long to be safe. I have seen rolls with raw fish on the conveyer belt from the time I arrived that are still on there when I leave. Who knows how long it was on there before I arrived and how long was it there after I left? Also I don't trust it to keep my raw fish at a safe temperature, which is why I won't eat there during the summer.   It is just a 2 star place...there is definitely better sushi out there.

I just ate here for the first time a couple weekends ago.  My boyfriend and I wanted to go somewhere new that had a happy hour, and we were definitely not disappointed with this spot!  When we first walked in, we were greeted by young man, who asked us if we had reservations.  Well apparently I'm deaf and I thought he asked us something else and I said yes...oops.  When we sat down my boyfriend told me what he said and so the next time I saw our waiter I apologized to him and said we could move tables if they wanted us to.  He was so nice though and he told us to stay and made us feel really welcome.  The happy hour was pretty awesome.  They had both wine and craft beers on the list too which was a plus.  The boyfriend ordered a Deschutes grapefruit beer which is one of his favs, and I ordered a glass of white wine.  For the meal, I ordered the salmon with quinoa and cous-cous.  I was so pleasantly surprised at how well they prepared the salmon there.  Typically at restaurants the salmon comes out dry and overcooked, however it was so tender and moist I could not believe it.  It was one of the best cooked salmon pieces I have ever been served at a restaurant.  My boyfriend ordered the burger and fries, and it was cool that they had so many different types of cheeses to put on your burger.  I'd recommend this place to couples looking to try something new on a date night.  The ambiance is cool and relaxing, and the lights are dimmed in there.  Don't be discouraged by the look of the place from the outside - it is so adorable inside!  Plus service was great and the food was really great quality.

I have been to this place several times now and I have had a good experience every time so far. The service is good and the tacos are tasty.  To anyone who doesn't eat meat - the vegetarian taco is so flavorful and delicious!!!! Order a couple of these and a beverage ;)  I love how they fresh squeeze all their juices and the happy hour is a great deal. I recommend the fresco drink with fresh pineapple juice and tequila.

I am updating my review as I have been disappointed the last several times I have been here.   First off, I'd like to clear the air and say the tacos are still good. Very delicious.   However I am disappointed that they no longer have a bunch of options of the "fresco drinks" like they used to. They used to have fresh squeezed pineapple juice among like 6 others, and now they only have 2 which include horchata and a mint one. I tried the mint one and it was bad. Really bad. Plus the mint was so chunky it kept clogging my straw.   Another thing, they bring out a huge bowl of chips and a tiny "complimentary" salsa. Seriously the salsa is so small. And if you want a refill, they charge you $2 for another one. First off, what Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa???? It just seems so petty. Come on Joyride, up your game a little bit. And they bring out a ton of chips knowing you need more salsa. Just soooo petty.   The margaritas used to have a kick but now they just taste like they are all sour.   I am hoping Joyride reverts back to the different fresh squeezed drink options and drops the charge for salsa soon. Not sure that I will be returning though.

Very very cool spot.  I love the whole ambiance inside of this place.  I love how the ingredients are local and how the menu is based off of the availability of items during certain seasons.  The Artichoke Dip from here is a MUST.  Most artichoke dip tastes the same everywhere you go, but this one is fire.  There are green chilies and cayenne pepper in it.  Wow.  I could eat a whole bowl of it.  It is the best I have ever had from anywhere.  It is so different that I get cravings for this.  The Black Bean Burger is a great pic for something on the healthier side, but what is even more amazing is the side...  You do get to choose between several sides, but you absolutely need to give the Beet and Apple salad a shot.  It is comprised of beets, apple slices, horseradish vinaigrette, blue cheese crumbles, and pecans.  Sounds strange, I know, I know.  But it is so different and absolutely perfect how all the flavors and textures work so harmoniously with one another.  It is so unique and I can't even describe to you how incredible this dish is.  Please give it a try!!!!  You will not be disappointed.  Love this place, can't wait for it to cool down to take advantage of the patio seating!!!!

This place is amazing for saturday/Sunday morning brunch. I love the unlimited mimosas special - and they make them just right too!!  The yogurt with granola and dried fruit is surprisingly delicious. They make their granola in-house. Very good if you want a light breakfast.   The ceviche is also very good, although it is a small bowl of it.   I love sitting on the patio outside and I love how the tables have little trivia cards in pepper tins. I definitely recommend this as a weekend brunch spot!!

Great spot if you have gluten-free needs!!!! The food is delicious and there are so many choices, which is not typical of most bakeries. Gluten-free food is often times very dry, however the pastries from here are not. They are soft and moist. I love this place!!!!

I just ate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago, at the new location. I definitely had higher expectations for this place that it did not come close to meeting.  The food seems great for hangovers, but if you are not sporting one then you will probably think very little of the food like I did. It is also grossly overpriced. The food portions are regular and you will not have any leftovers to bring home.   Our meal started off with the Huancaina con Camaron...which is described well on the menu. It is a boiled potato with one small slice of boiled egg on top. A few small overcooked and shelled shrimp. $9. They must make a ton of money charging people $9 for 1 potato and a few small shrimp.   I ordered the Saltado de Camarones and my boyfriend ordered the Tallarin Salteando de Carne. My plate was french fries with a bunch of onions and some more small shrimp on top. $16. They did not bring out the correct plate for my boyfriend (which the waitress even recommended to us)...instead they brought him Lomo Saltado which was the same thing as mine but with a few strips of beef (on top of french fries and onions). $12.   I do not recommend this spot unless you have a hangover and money to throw at basic food. We will not be returning. The only reason this spot got the 2nd star is because the waitress was nice.

I came here for lunch recently and was very impressed by the hospitality I experienced  at this restaurant.  When we first walked in, we were warmly greeted and told we could sit anywhere.  We decided to have the lunch buffet and got up to walk over to it. A man who I assume to be the owner of the restaurant kindly walked with us to where the food was and gave us recommendations for sauces with certain dishes, which we greatly appreciated and have never experienced at an Indian buffet before. He was so warm and welcoming, and even went to the kitchen to get us fresh stuffed Indian crepes (pardon me for not knowing the technical name for these...)  There was another woman working there who made sure our beverages were always full and that we had everything we needed, coming to our table just the right amount.   The food was delicious and although it is all vegetarian, my meat-loving boyfriend enjoyed his plate as well, and even got full off of it - which he never thought was possible.   I would definitely recommend this place as the food was great and the hospitality was off the charts. Just a very positive experience here that exceeded my expectations, and I will be coming back again =)

This is my favorite new sushi spot!!!!   The sashimi and tuna love roll - amazing. My boyfriend and I always get the Samurai sashimi special. The fish always tastes like it is fresh and of very good quality. It is nice too because the sashimi special comes with a small nigiri plate as well.   A lot of the rolls are okay, but the tuna love roll is wonderful. If you want to get a roll, this one is the ticket.   I would recommend passing on the rolls though and getting the samurai sashimi special. You won't go wrong there!  Just fyi they are closed on Tuesdays. I have been there a couple times on a Tuesday craving their deliciousness, only to have my heart broken by the locked doors.   4.5 stars!

This place just opened recently so I was excited to try them out.  Big mistake.  I came here a week ago, on 08/23 and had a horrible experience.  When I pulled my car up, there were no employees anywhere and the gates to let your car through weren't opening for anyone.  I couldn't back out because of cars behind me, so I was just stuck waiting.  I saw an employee come out and she attended to the middle aisle.  After waiting for at least 5-8 minutes in line and the guy in front of me (who was the first guy in that line) still had not gone through, I knew I had to just get into a different line.  Enough people went through the middle one that I was able to back out and I went to go fill my car up with gas and give them time to get themselves in order.  After filling up my car with gas I came back, and got in the middle lane this time.  I waited probably about 4 more minutes in this one before I got through the gate.  Once I was pulling in and putting my car in neutral, I rolled down my window and the attendant gave me a cloth to wipe down the inside of my car.  I paid for one that was also supposed to come with an air freshener and I wanted a cherry one.  I called the attendant back and asked him "doesn't my package come with an air freshener?"  Completely uncaring, he asked to see my receipt, which I handed to him, and he handed me a new car smell air freshener without even giving me my options or a have a nice day or anything.  I had no time to tell him that I wanted a cherry one because all this happened while my car was on the track and pulling into the washing part.  The wash was decent although I don't think their passenger side air-blowers work very well, because my passenger side windows were still wet when I was done with the wash.  I had a few water spots on my windows because of this.  Overall, it was a very frustrating experience and I do not recommend.  The price was good, the wash was decent, the service was atrocious.

I just went here tonight and let me tell you it was the most fun I have had in a long time!!!!  Wow.   This was my first escape room adventure and I'm afraid none of the others will live up to this one! It was so well organized and the details were quite intricate.   I can't write much on here because I don't want to give anything away, but please go try this for yourself!!!! You will not be disappointed.   I do recommend going with a large group, as it is a little harder to communicate when everyone is a stranger.   So fun! 5 stars for sure!!!!

The service was good here, but the place did not have much else going for it.   It is extremely overpriced and the food is so incredibly bland.   They don't have gluten-free pasta which really took me by surprise... I couldn't believe they weren't on board with that yet. Especially being located in old Town Gilbert surrounded by food and health-conscious restaurants and consumers. They really need to get with the program.   I ended up getting a $22 sea bass which I would've been embarrassed to serve to someone! It was so tiny and thin, I could not believe they would even plate it. It was mostly 1/4" thick, and in some areas 1/2" thick. Most sea bass I have eaten at a restaurant has come out thick and flaky and tender. Seriously I ate here a week ago and I am still in shock that they served that thin overly cooked / crispy little thing to me. It was so bland and when I finished eating it, my stomach felt like it was ready for an entree. But that was it!!!!  My boyfriend got a pasta that he described as nicely cooked, however it was also tasteless and also a tiny bowl.   I did get some kind of spicy tequila cocktail from there that was good. I have to give the bartender some credit for that. We would've stayed and had a few more drinks but the food was so embarrassingly bad that we took our check as fast as we could and went somewhere else.   I do not recommend this spot, especially if you are hungry, or have taste buds, and we will not be returning either.
