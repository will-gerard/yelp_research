I used to shop at Officemax often, but no more.  I got a card in the mail good for $10 off a purchase of $50 or more. I needed a new router and they had them on sale. I went in bought the router on sale for $48 and I bought some ink for my printer. They rang me up took the card and gave me the discount no problem.   Then I got home and the router didn't work. I called the manufacture's tech support and after about 30 minutes they told me the router itself was bad and gave me a return code to take it back to OfficeMax.  I returned the router, they were out of the one I purchased so I bought a different one that was the EXACT SAME Price.  When I went to the register to pay for it the cashier told me the total came to $11 and some change.  I asked how can that be? I bought a router, it didn't work, I returned it and got a different router that was the exact same price.   They told me I used a coupon the first time and unless I had another coupon I needed to pay the difference.  I asked for the manager and he said the same thing so I walked out to my truck and grabbed the ink I purchased then returned it too, got my money back and drove across the street to a different store and bought the router there.  They obviously need to learn about customer service.

I love this place. Not only does it save me money but they stand behind their product. I have purchased several cartridges from them and I had one that I thought was bad, I took it back and they exchanged it no problem. (I found out it was a bad print head and not a bad cartridge later)  I have sent several friends there and one of them told me that they were told to buy new cartridges because the they would not be happy with the refills for that printer. (They don't sell that cartridge new)  That type of honesty as well as their prices will keep me coming back.

Best bike shop in Gilbert hands down.  They have road bikes, Mountain bikes, BMX Bikes, Cruisers and more.  The staff is nice and they are very involved in the community. They offer classes on how to ride, how to train, how to maintain, first aid and more.  I have bought two mountain bikes from this shop and they have sponsored and/or provided sag support for several rides all over the state. They will treat you right.

I am between 3.5 to 4 stars but the service was great so I bumped the review up.  I like the shrimp and the boneless wings, great selection of sauces. I ate lunch there with some friends and they said their salad and sandwich were average, but nothing to write home about (they did eat all their food)   If your there to watch sports, you will love it. If your there to talk shop or do a little business it was a little noisy and there are TV's everywhere distracting you.  Bottom line, Good sports bar and fun place, not the best place to do business.  I will be back for shrimp and boneless wings and to enjoy a cold one with the game

Neat place a little bigger than the standard Starbucks but the coffee is good, there is lots of seating and the staff is very nice.  They have free wi-fi and a small conference room in the back great for that lunch business meeting or a late afternoon meet up.  They also have live Christian music on Friday nights, I thought that was kind of cool.   They get fresh pastry's in daily and I haven't been disappointed yet.  This is my Tuesday morning hang out. I meet business people here every Tuesday for a network meeting and they welcome us with open arms.  Check it out.

My wife and I had 4 others meet us on the bar patio for happy hour. We looked at the appetizer menu and I decided to try the BIG ASS BURGER.  This meal was not an appetizer, it was huge. It came with fries and both the burger and the fries were good. It has to be over 1/2lb of beef, I had all I could do to finish it but during happy hour it was $9. Great deal  When dinner (and several drinks) were over, our server started telling us about the deserts and recommended the banana split. This is a banana with chocolate chunks, and caramel wrapped in a tortilla and fried, then rolled in cinnamon and sugar and served with ice cream and sauce.   Ohhh, This was so good and rich, she brought one desert and 6 spoons. We had all we could do to finish it.  The mens room is a hike from the bar patio, infact it is in the middle of the adjoining office building. I was surprised that a place this nice did not have it's own mens room.

Well I am going to write my first 5 stare review.  The wife and I ate at the Keg Steakhouse on Saturday night and had a great experience.  There was a wait but we found big leather chairs to sit in the lounge while we waited. A cute, tall, blond, waitress took our dring order, offered us menus and checked on us about every 5 minutes during the 30 minutes we waited for a table.  Then we were sat at a cozy table for two, we both had ceaser salads and the Parmesan cheese was thin slices not powered, it was great.  We had the top sirloin and I have to be honest, when the food arrived I thought they screwed up the order because this sirloin looked like a fillet an was almost as tender. The backed potato and vegetables were cooked to perfection.   The Salt and pepper grinders on the table were also a nice touch. I love grinding my salt and pepper.  About half way through dinner the manager stopped by to check and make sure everything was perfect. This is something most places should do but for some strange reason they don't.  I can tell you we will be trying their other locations to see if the service and food at those places match what we found, if not, I guess I will be driving 45 minutes one way to go have dinner.

Anything I say here will have already been said but Joe's is the best BBQ in the east valley.   The food is great, the place is clean, seating inside or outside, their Saturday Breakfast is awesome and I don't want to get in trouble for telling you what kind of experience your mouth will have with the home made root beer.   Lets just say if your spouse makes you feel like this root beer make your mouth feel you are one lucky person.

I have eaten there twice and ordered out a few times. When you order out they tell you it will be 30 minutes. Realistically its 40-45. They have always been nice and gave be a free fountain drink while I wait but now I just come a little later.  The pizza is great, I love it. I always order the Brooklyn and I love the fresh basil on it.  When I have eaten there I had mixed experiences, the first time was great, the second time the server spent more time complaining about her fellow employees than serving us.    I will eat here again and if your in the area I suggest you try it out.

This is my favorite place for cheese steaks,   The staff is beyond nice and greeted me by name the second time I walked in the door.  Visiting this place is like going to visit friends. I have gotten to know a few of the family members first names but I still do not know their last name.  This is one of the few places that carry Tasty Cakes.  It is noisy inside and I wish they had outdoor seating, but it is not so bad to keep me away.  Try it out, take a moment and say hi to the staff and ask them what they recommend, By the time you leave, they will make you feel like family too.

My wife and I were staying at the condos at Desert Ridge and decided to go here with friends for dinner. We had a 30 minute wait for a table but a server came by and got us drinks while we waited and another came by later with some pizza to try. We were seated and our server was very attentive.  My wife had the chicken pasta and asked them if they could throw some cajun spice in it. Wow it was amazing, it should be on the menu.  I had the pork chops, the apples and potatoes were good but I ordered the pork chops medium and they were well done. I was halfway through them by the time the server came by and I didn't mention it to her because I didn't want to wait for them to cook more.  Our friends ended up having Pizza. It was good, not great. To be honest I am more of a thin crust guy and this was a thicker crust.  All in all I would eat there again.

I took the wife to Eddies House for our 11th anniversary. I wanted something different and I knew Eddie would not disappoint me.  We sat on the patio and the weather was perfect.   My wife loved the pesto and bread, I personally likes the flatbread.  She had the whats in this steak. It was ok, she said there was just too many potatos.  I had the meatloaf. I may have made a mistake because I don't know if my wife will make meatloaf again after I raved about Eddies.  I had her try it and she agreed it was real good.  I liked the fact that you can order 1/2 entrees. We had an appetizer, we both ordered 1/2 entrees and we had room for the chocolate chip cookie terimisu (sp) this thing was rich sweet, great tasting and the perfect way to top off the night.  The service was good but not great, I expected a little better.   One of the main reasons I took my wife there is so she could meet Eddie and see him in person. Wouldn't you know we went on the one night he decided to spend home with his family.  Well I guess he deserves a night off every now and then.  It is a comfortable place that is warm, not stuffy.  We will be back

I have been to Bergies several times. I have tried several of their coffees and haven't had a bad cup yet. I only gave it four stars because I like a hot breakfast and all they offer are pastries.  If you are looking for a good cup of coffee, a place to sit down and use the wi-fi or a quaint spot for a meeting, Bergies is the place to go,

This place rocks.  I tried BevMo and it was OK but Total Wine is the place to go. their prices are the lowest I have seen their selection is great. I like several types of liquor but have never been a huge fan of wines.  That changes every time I come to this store. The wine tasting has really taught me how to select wines. The staff is great. There is one person there (sorry I don't know his name) that I have gone to a few times and said this is what I am fixing for dinner and this is what my guest like, I want something new. He makes recommendations (usually less expensive than what I was looking at) I buy them and my guests are thrilled.  If you are looking for a relaxing afternoon out of the heat go to one of their wine tastings. (some times they taste other liquor too)  If you want beer selection go there. They have several Gluten free beers also  I have to stop myself from visiting the store whenever I drive by. Its just that good.

I went to this store because I bought a new Toshiba laptop with Vista on it and I can't stand Vista.  It doesn't work with my old programs and Microsoft really screwed up the scanner camera wizard.  So I went in looking for solutions. I found the staff to be very helpful and knowledgeable, they tried to talk me into upgrading to Windows 7 pro as it can run XP in a virtual environment and assured me that would solve the issues I was having.  I was less than eager to purchase the new software on the word of a salesman and they didn't have a computer in the store with Windows 7 Pro on it so they got a manager to assist me.  He explained that he would have to get corporate approval to install Windows 7 pro on one of their units but he would do so and contact me when he had a system to demonstrate for me.  Two days later I got the call, I returned to the store wit my old XP laptop, my new Vista laptop and my camera (so I could demonstrate how superior the XP scanner camera wizard is)  I met the manager and he proceeded to show me how great Windows 7 is and I was impressed right up to the point where I got to try it for myself like I would use it for business.  It had the same issues as Vista. We opened XP in virtual mode and the new scanner camera wizard opened when I connected the camera. then I showed the manager how it works on my 6 year old XP laptop and he realized, that windows 7 Pro would not work for me.  I gave them four stars because they really tried to help and treated me very well even though I didn't buy anything.  If your a windows user, and need help or advice, go check them out, they were polite, and professional. Its not their fault that Microsoft screws up every good thing they make.  Did I mention I'm a PC and Vista was a bad idea.

I joined some friends here tonight and had a blast. the wine tasting was great, 4 out of 5 were winners. They did run out of the smokehouse bear but they didn't charge us for it since they couldn't give everyone a full glass.  The place was packed but we were served rather quickly.  The server was a little bit of an air head but she was fun and had a good personality so we let it slide.  My food was good but my friends said theirs was great.  If you are looking for a fun place and a good glass of wine, I would not hesitate to check this place out.

My new favorite Lunch spot. Food is great, the place is cozy inside, it is not what I expected from the parking lot. It is a little hard to find but worth looking for. The bar tender was Kati and she took good care of us. Try the deep fried green beans, yes that's right, they will surprise you. Beer is cold and reasonable priced.   I have taken business associates here and they have all been impressed. Whether your on a date or having a business lunch this place treats you right. They also have a neat patio to take advantage of while the weather  is still nice

If I wrote this review 6 months ago it would only have been 4 stars but now they have awesome sandwiches.  The owners of this place say  "this place is the ultimate vacation in a cup". I'm not sure if I would go that far but I have decided there are so many good drinks on the menu I don't even try to pick one anymore. I just pay them and say surprise me.  Every time the smoothie is just fantastic. I'm there at least once a week. Bring a friend, relax and enjoy  I don't know why but my review was filtered

I have dealt with this store for years and had OK service in the past but recently the staff here went way above and beyond to help me out.  I have a commercial account and I needed to add two phones. Last Wednesday, Michelle helped me and directed me toward two phones that were free but also had a $100 bill credit each, after the first month. (Score)  I also needed some tablets. I already have a few Samsung Galaxy 6" tablets that work well. Michelle told me they were on sell for $100 and they would each have a $25 credit to my account. I decided to wait on the tablets as I don't need them for about a month. However I had a bad car charger that was only about a month old and Michelle got a manager to replace it for me free of charge. (Score again)  A week later I get a call from Michelle at the Verizon store, The Samsung Galaxy Tablets are now FREE with a 2 year plan and I still get the $25 bill credit. I asked her to grab me 3 and I would be in the next day to get them. (Score Again,)  I have never had a sales rep pay that much attention to my needs but it didn't stop there, she knew I needed cases for the tablets and this store was out so she stopped by another store the next morning and got the cases from them so I wouldn't have to make another trip. (Score again)  I had 3 tablets that were eligible for upgrades so we upgraded those, got 3 more, got cases and I needed some other accessories that the manager couldn't discount but she authorized another $100 credit to my account.  I know this store is busy and I have had to wait 3- minutes in the past to be helped but when they treat you like this, it is worth the wait.

I found out about this place at a Gilbert Small Business Alliance Mixer.  They had a 3 minute fitness challenge and I for some God forsaken reason entered it.  WOW, what a work out. My arms were sore for 2 days from a 3 minute drill.  I went back in today for a training session. The trainers are polite, professional and knowledgeable. I was very impressed.  The only down side to this place is they have a co-ed restroom and no locker room. I am used to showering and changing at the gym, not here.  I really love their style of training, They really work on core muscles and balance, not on increasing your bench press. Their program works you in ways that will help you in your day to day life, I guess that is why it is called Funktional.  I will be returning to this place and if you have the time to check it out, I highly recommend it.

Now I have been going to this place for a week.  The first session was pretty much all about the warm up, lots of stretching and moves that help loosen you up. (I didn't know my body could bend and move like that.)  The second session was more intense, yes we warmed up but we did some moves that were similar to yoga and then added a kettle bell weight just to make things interesting.  (I will learn to hate the kettle bell one day I am sure) Some of the drills may look a little funny but it is amazing how you can feel these drills working while you are doing them. Another cool thing is the trainer has you make one little change and you feel the workout effect a different area.  My trainer was great and that is one thing that separates this place from the rest, the trainers get to know you, they work with you for the entire session and design a program that is right for you. (Of course I got the young studly guy instead of one of the many HOT female trainers they have here. I'm not complaining, this helped me focus on my work out)   This is not the same old circuit training you've seen in the past. At the end of the second day my trainer worked with me on cooling down and stretching. I don't mean that he stood there and told me what to do, He actually was hands on, stretching and increasing range of movement. It was awesome.  I should mention here that I have not disclosed the trainers name here for a reason; they have several trainers, and while I work with the same one every time I have seen many of the others and they are all great.  Now the workouts are more intense, I am feeling the change start and I am liking it. With out using weights I am working and stretching till parts of my body shake. My trainer calls it the tremor of truth) and there are some weights we use on other days but the program changes daily so there is no getting bored with the same old thing each time. This is not back and bicep one day chest and triceps the next day. This is working groups of muscles and strengthening your core muscles while improving balance and flexibility.  I mentioned before that they do not have lockers or showers but I recently learned that they are expanding and will have showers and lockers in the new facility that should open on October.  I have belonged to several gyms over the years and even had personal trainers, however these guys take the extra time needed to make sure you get out of the program what you want and make you feel more like a friend when you walk in the door than a number on a membership card.  Check it out, I'm glad I did.

I have seen chiropractors for most of my life.  I was referred to Dr. Q. by a student at the Southwest school of naturopathic medicine.   Dr Q has done more for me in a short period of time than other chiropractors have done in years. While many chiropractors focus on your back and neck, Dr. Q takes a whole body approach. If your ankle, knee or hip are out f alignment, it can through the rest of your body out as well. That was my issue, for years I have worn out the outside corner of my right heal when the rest of the sole of my shoes looked new. I thought it was just the way I walked.  Dr. Q adjusted me the first time and I went and bought new shoes, 6 months later my shoe are evenly worn, my back & neck pain is gon as well as my headaches.  In addition he pointed me to some supplements I needed then told me to go buy them somewhere else because they were less expensive there than what he has to charge for them.  I have referred him to my wife and children and he has helped both of them as well.  He is also a photographer and has several pictures he has taken in his office. He loves to talk about his pictures and rightfully so, they are cool. His prices are middle of the road. You will find many chiropractors that cost less and some that cost more, but this guy helped me more than all of the others combined.

I love this place. I came once a week for a network meeting when it was coffee island but now I find myself liking coffee again. They have a new house blend, great food, new menu and better hours. The staff makes you feel welcome.  I only gave it 4 stars because they are still getting their feet underneath them and I know more changes are on the way and the place will be even better then. At that point I may need to write another review.  Check it out I doubt you will be disappointed.

I have been to the Hub a few times. I am always treated like a VIP (don't know why)  Service has always been great, food is good and the prices are fair.  I recently went to a Realtor after hours there and they had pretzel bites and pizza. The bites were great, just the right amount of butter and salt.  I also love the milk stout they have on tap.  I don't go to the far east valley but when I do I will make it a point to stop here again.  Oh, I guess they have a corn hole tournament every Wednesday night. It looked like fun.

First of all let me say the place is clean and the staff is very nice.  My wife and I both joined a year ago and signed up our daughter as well.  I thought it was weird that they took out 3 separate payments each month instead of one payment for the 3 of us but now I understand why.  My wife and I haven't used our membership for months so we went in to close it out and found out there is a $25 fee for canceling the membership, and it is not just one fee, it is $25 per person.   So I had to pay $50 to cancel a membership that neither my wife or I have used for months.  I am VERY upset.  If you read many review sites you will see I will be re-posting this everywhere.

I have had a spasm on my left shoulder for two days. I couldn't get in for a massage today and my normal reflexology place is closed on Sunday so I decided to try the Wonder Foot Spa at Cooper and Warner.  They are running a so-called special for $29 (the normal price where I typically go) for 1 hour of reflexology and massage.  The reflexology way the worst I have had, she didn't even hit key pressure points on my hands or feet.  The massage was worse. She just lightly rubbed, I asked her to push harder and for more pressure but she didn't speak English.  When i rolled over on to my stomach, she lifted my feet on to a pillow with a cold wet towel on it.,   When she was done I went to pay and her manager proceeded to tell me the minimum tip was $10 or 30%.  For the record, I have been to many different places that do reflexology and not being able to speak English is not unusual, but they normally understand harder or more pressure.  I won't be back.
