Hollis did a great job! She made sure my expectations were realistic and did a price breakdown before she got started. It was pretty pricey ( way more than I've ever spent on my hair- $149) for highlights and toner. The salon itself is very nice. They do complimentary wine and scalp massages! Overall, great salon if you can afford to spend that much.

Brought my dog here last minute! They were able to get him in same day and did a fabulous job! He smelled so good and his hair cut was perfect. The owner was so nice and friendly and the storefront was cute and clean! I will definitely be bringing my dog back.

Love this place for take-out! They have taken my expired 20% off coupons, which is nice. They are always fast and friendly and the food is great. I have never encountered any "mystery meat" in any dishes I have ordered. The orange chicken is the best! Not as sweet and fried like other places. The won ton soup is another favorite.

I love this store. They have really nice quality furniture for a good price. You can definitely find cheaper furniture at places such as living spaces and American furniture warehouse but this is definitely higher end. They are nice enough staff. They have a section of used vintagey items and a section of new. Check it out of you are looking for new furniture!

Stopped in for an iced tea and ended up buying a chocolate croissant and a loaf of bread! The croissant was delicious. The tea was fresh and not bitter. Their menu looked great. I'll definitely be back for food sometime soon.

We went in for some breakfast after a late night. Waited for ten minutes for anyone to talk to us. Walked around the corner to find the waitress asleep. Take a nap before you come to work!

Love this place!! I always get the chicken shawarma plate and it is so much food. It has lots of chicken, hummus, rice, and a salad. I think it's about ten dollars. Everything is so flavorful and fresh! They people who work here are always very friendly and make sure you have everything you need. They always get busy around lunch time so I would recommend calling in if you are in a hurry. Love this place!

Wow! This place is goooooood. When we got there they said there would be a 40 minute wait, but we were seated within 15. I can see why they were so busy! I had the combo with the green corn tamale and chile relleno with a side of flour tortillas. My fiancé had the spinach enchiladas. The flour tortillas were being handmade in a corner of the restaurant and omg they were delicious. The chile relleno was super flavorful but the breading was a little thin. The tamale was so good! It was full of corn and cheese. The spinach enchiladas were different but they were very tasty. They had a red sauce on them and not a ton of cheese, but they were very flavorful. The margarita was very good, not too sweet. Our total bill for two entrees, a margarita and a beer was 29 and change. They also had a mariachi band playing which was fun. Love this place so much!

I LOVE this place. They give you SO MUCH food! I'm not kidding. One plate is more than enough for two people. I've had the pancakes which are fluffy and delicious, the Denver omelet which is loaded with bell peppers and ham, and the biscuits and gravy which... Yes, just yes. The biscuits are dense and hearty and the gravy is really peppery and thick. Plus, everything is so inexpensive! Two biscuits and gravy, hash browns, bacon, and two eggs is around 6 dollars and change. The waitresses are wonderful- super friendly and quick. Love coming here for Sunday breakfast!

I finally got to experience lux when it wasn't way too busy! Yay! It was actually comfortable to be in because I didn't have to sit next to a stranger or crowd around the register while waiting for my coffee. Their coffee is always delicious, I just wish the set up was better and had more seating.

I voted three stars and my fiancé voted four so we will round up!  Service - great! Very attentive and nice! We were seated immediately and never had an empty glass.  Ambiance- very nice upscale place. What you would expect.   Good- fiancé got the Gastro pub burger that was delicious! It had bacon jam and arugula and blue cheese. It was cooked perfectly. I got the artisan grilled cheese. It said it had avocado mayo and like four different kinds of cheese. This thing was CHEESY! A little too cheesy without enough avocado flavor to break up the heavy cheese and butter taste. I couldn't taste the mayo at all. It needed some tomato or arugula or actual avocado to break up the cheese. This paired with the garlic fries was just too much. I could only eat half.   Drinks- the Belgian ipa was very good! It was hoppy but not toooo hoppy. The house made root beer was delicious!   Overall we liked this place ! Next time I will order the cioppino which sounded amazing.

What a great store! This place was huge which was unexpected from the look of the store. Everything was very reasonably priced. They had two huge beautiful mirrors for 36 dollars and an adorable rolling chair for only 45. I wanted to buy everything here. I probably could have too without breaking the bank.

I would love to give Souvia 5 stars. I have been going here for years and always love my experience. I really love their selection of teas and all of the employees are always very helpful and friendly. Their milk oolong is delicious and  I love how I can get a 32oz iced tea that lasts me all day! However, I was very annoyed with my recent visit. My uncle purchased a gift certificate for me online since he knows I like to stop in for iced teas. I went into the store with my printed gift certificate ready. I was very disappointed when I was told the gift certificate is only good for online purchases since it was purchased through their online store. The girl working told me the owner says the online store is different than the actual store... This makes no sense to me. It seems as if the owner is still making a profit whether or not the gift certificate is being used online or in person. Isn't the product coming from the same stock??? It didn't say anywhere online that this would be the case. So if you are buying a gift certificate, do it in the store so you can actually use it in the store!

I am updating my review after receiving great customer service! I purchased a few items on Souvia's online store with my gift certificate and later received a call about my order. While on the phone I told the owner of my confusion with the gift certificate situation. The next day she called me to let me know she spoke with her husband (the other owner) and that they would send me a gift card to use in store in exchange for the online gift certificate. Yay! I have never had a store owner call me before. She went above and beyond to make sure I was a happy customer. Thanks, Souvia!

Update: we keep coming back because we really want to like this place. I don't think we will be back. We waited for ten minutes before anyone talked to us. People who sat down after us had menus and drinks before we were even acknowledged. A couple sitting behind us had been waiting awhile also before the waiter finally came up to them. He approached them by saying "you've been hiding! Has anyone helped you?" When they said "no, not yet..." The waiter responded with "well what do you want?". It seems like that would have been a good opportunity to apologize for the wait and assure them they would be taking care of them. Anyways, after ordering food, it took a good thirty minutes. Nobody asked if we needed refills on coffee or anything. When the food finally did come out, it was alright. I ordered the tacos and my fiancé ordered the Cali chicken sandwich. The tacos were fine, though the meet was a little dry. The sandwich also fine. Not worth waiting so long and having no service. After four times here, I think we are done. :(

Came here for Valentine's Day and it was amazing. The bruschetta and arroncini was delicious. The arrabiata was so flavorful as was the Rosemary chicken. The dessert was our favorite part of the meal. We had the salted caramel budino and tiramisu. It was all perfect! We will definitely be back!

Mehhhhhh this place.... It was 35 dollars for two burgers and a Coke. Burgers were not great. They were big but lacked flavor. My Kilauea burger tasted only of pepper. I couldn't taste anything else. Fries were fine. The ranch dressing was our favorite thing here..... Waitresses were attentive though.

Oh man, I love Grimaldis! Their pizza is incredible. I always get the white pizza with mushrooms and olives. This pizza does not need many toppings because the cheese and crust are both delicious. The cheese is slices of fresh mozzarella, which I love. The pizza is never soggy or burnt. The only negative about grimaldis is that the prices are a little high. It's $22 for a plain pizza and toppings vary from $2-3 each. Good thing I don't like a lot of toppings on my pizza! They also are always very busy so make sure you either plan ahead or go earlier in the day. Love this place!!!

Five stars for food because it was delicious but lost a few stars for a few reasons. First of all, this place is EXPENSIVE! We got a gift card for here for fifty dollars and thought that would be enough to cover at least half of our bill. I could not find menu prices anywhere online so we went in sort of blind. Our bill came out in triple digits for the two least expensive items on the menu and two glasses of wine. Let's just say it was about the cost of my car payment. When we got there they had a card since we were celebrating and they gave us a box of truffles as a celebration gift which was also very nice! We definitely appreciated that. However, there was a table next to us that had a less than happy customer who was shouting at the wait staff and manager to go "f$&@ themselves." This went on for a good TEN minutes. This guy obviously frequents places such as this and it is not a big deal for him to drop hundreds of dollars on a meal considering he was so rude to the waitresses and to all the customers trying to enjoy their evenings. Our waitress said she was sorry and the gm gave us his card and a 25 dollar off coupon to come back. I felt like that should have been something that could have been handled better. I know it is not their fault that the customer was drunk, rude, and belligerent. However, I did not appreciate paying that much $$$$$$ and having that experience. I do not want and cannot afford to come back here and use the $25 coupon. That was basically 10% off a future visit. This is like a once every two years type of dinner for my bf and I so a coupon doesn't do us much good. Something for this visit could have been compensated but maybe their truffles and the business card was their apology? I really wanted to have a great experience considering that the food was truly delicious but i just did not. Oh, and their menu is "a la carte" meaning that steak you are paying 50+ dollars for.... literally is just a steak. No sides unless you want to pay another $12 for one. Come on Flemings.... I expected more.

Okay so we went back for happy hour as the general manager recommended and WOW!!! Everything was so good. We got a burger, the pork belly, and the burrata. The burrata was so creamy and they gave you quite a bit. The pork belly was served with cherries and arugula salad. It was salty and delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly and came with bacon and cheese. The happy hour prices were awesome! I will return for happy hour!

What a cute place! Came here this morning for some coffee and breakfast. As soon as we walked in, it smelled like fresh donuts! I ordered a vanilla latte, a plain glazed donut, and a bagel sandwich with Swiss, avocado, and sausage. The latte was just alright. It was very watery though. I'm not sure what kind of milk they use or what it was. It tasted good, just a little weak and watery. The donut was sooo good! It was light and fluffy and sweet. The bagel sandwich was awesome! It tasted very fresh and homemade and I loved that they had avocado. My friend ordered a caramel iced coffee with cream. The girl behind the counter asked if she wanted to make it a latte, which makes me think they interchange the two, which is why it was watery for a latte. Maybe they made an iced coffee with milk in it? She ordered a blueberry bagel with cream cheese that was good too. Everything in their bakery case looked amazing! I want to try the bran muffin and all of their donuts! I would come here if you want delicious baked goods, but not necessarily coffee. They did have a large selection of drinks though (tea, smoothies, hot chocolate) so I will try something new next time. It was worth the 15 minute drive.

We go to paquime on Dunlap and central all the time so decided to try this place out! It was really good! They have many of the same menu items and they were just as delicious. We got the Mexicana torta, the twin burritos, and the papas nachos, all of which were great. I asked for jalapeños on the side of the nachos and that really made them! The meat in the torta was flavorful and tender. Their ice cream looked really good, so I will try that next time!

Came here on a Sunday because everywhere else was busy. Now I know why this place wasn't. Good was not disgusting but it was not that good. Ordered the anaheim scramble and my boyfriend ordered a panini. Both were flavorless and room temperature. The toast was good but not warm so the butter never melted. Probably will not return.

I got the build your own omelet with all the  veggies and a side of potatoes. It was delicious! There were tons of veggies and everything tastes very fresh. I got an Americano with cream that was pretty good. Not as good as fame or lux but better than Starbucks. I liked that it was counter service because it felt more casual. This place can get very busy though and it can be hard to find a table. I would suggest going earlier in the morning or on a weekday. We ended up getting a table but felt a bit crowded. I love that this place has specialty groceries too. They have tons of cute knick knacks and everything you could need for your gluten free, paleo, non gmo, baking needs. Overall, super cute place with delicious food!

Very good apple fritters and buttermilk bars! The apple fritters are nice and crispy with big chunks of apples. The buttermilk bar was so moist with just the right amount of sweet. The people were friendly enough. I think I still prefer lamars for location and atmosphere, but the donuts are equally delicious.

Everyone was so nice and friendly. Definitely an older crowd. The food was just not that good. It needed salt and seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were the best thing but not as good as Peoria cafe. The Denver omelet tasted very generic and like the ham was from a can.

I've been here twice now and each time I'm amazed at how much I like the macaroni salad. I don't typically like macaroni salad but theirs is really good! It's not too mayonnaisey. I've had their chicken soup and the lemon pepper chicken, both of which are tasty! The chicken is always moist and flavorful. The soup was good and I liked everything in it, but it needed salt. Seriously my favorite thing here though is the macaroni salad. Prices are reasonable!

I'm sorry, Bibianos, but this just was not that good. I got a groupon and ordered takeout. We ordered the green tamale with a cheese enchilada and the taco and enchilada. The tamale was pretty good, but very mushy. Everything else was just very bland. I would rather eat at filibertos. I'm sad because this place is the closest Mexican restaurant to my house but it just was not that good. It was not gross, but it was very forgettable.

Short: good coffee, delicious pastries, good lunch, not a fan of the breakfast items, great people. I would come here for coffee and pastries.  Long: Over the winter my boyfriend and I came here for about five days in a row since it is in walking distance of our house. I love the coffee and their pastries. I have had the toffee mocha three times. It is chocolatey without being cloyingly sweet (in comparison to Starbucks). The owners are so nice and friendly. You feel like you are in their kitchen. We have had some food we liked and some we didn't. The Irish stew is good along with the Caesar salad and the pasties. All of the pastries are perfect. I did not really enjoy the porkys panini. Too salty and not enough balance of flavors. It also gave me heartburn for a week. The bacon nut was just a little too strange for me. Not gross, but would not get again. Bacon and slivered almonds on an egg sandwich?! We were not a fan of the breakfast sandwiches in general (most served on hamburger buns with mayo). On food alone, I would have rated 3 stars but the customer service and friendly people earn another star from me!

This place is close to our house so we have been here a few times. Their yogurt is not as creamy as yogurtini which is my fave frozen yogurt, but it does the trick when you want frozen yogurt. Their topping selection is the same as you would get anywhere else. Tonight I got one of their smoothies which are just frozen fruit and nothing else. I really loved the smoothie. You could tell it was real fruit. Overall, a decent frozen yogurt shop!

I had been wanting to come here for awhile so I'm glad we made the 30 minute drive to come! Everyone was so friendly. all of the staff came up to us and made sure we were good and had everything we needed. The iced coffee was really great! I ordered the BMOC and my bf got the banging pocket. They were both really delicious. I would order either of them again. The atmosphere was comfortable, modern, and clean. One thing I did not expect was that it was counter service. We will be back!

Holy giant cinnamon roll! We came here on a Sunday morning at 9 and there was about a ten minute wait. We ordered the Greek omelet which had gyro meat and feta cheese and it was pretty good. The eggs seemed a little dry but the fillings were good. The sourdough toast was really yummy! We ordered the cinnamon roll and we were blown away at how big it was. It was the size of a full dinner plate! It was really good for being so big. It wasn't dry or anything and it had a ton of frosting. We ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. They only have them on Sunday mornings and it was only $5! We liked this place overall but probably won't come back unless we want a cinnamon roll because it was kind of far from us.

I don't know what all the fuss is about their tacos being too small! They are standard taco size.... And I had more than enough food! I ordered the combo which comes with one taco, chips and salsa, a drink, and one tapas. I was stuffed! They give you plenty of chips and a large container of salsa. I got the salsa verde which was delicious- I could drink that stuff. For my tapas I got the papas Fritas which were also very yummy! They came with a spicy mayo. I got the chicken taco which was good. It had a really authentic Mexican taste and had plenty of guacamole. The chicken itself was super flavorful. All of this was $8.19. Next time I'm going to try the shrimp!

If I could give them more stars I would. This place is amazing. We walked in and didn't have anyone come up to us for about five minutes. Finally a waitress came over and was very apologetic and took our orders right away. She came back and said that they would be giving us a complimentary dessert and rushing our food. The food came out after about seven minutes. It was delicious! I had the Sunday prime rib which was cooked perfectly and was not too smoky. My boyfriend had the short ribs which were fantastic! The bbq sauce was perfect and the portion was huge! The Mac and cheese was also just right. Probably the best short ribs I've ever had. The waitress came back and took our plates and brought out the peach and blueberry cobbler which was very good. When she brought us our check she said they were taking 50% off our bill! We will definitely be back again and again. Our new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.

This place is awesome. I don't know why haven't been here sooner. The food was delicious and the staff was very helpful. They let us sample all of the meat to decide which one we wanted. The restaurant itself is very clean. I love their theme! Very original. This place is authentic and trendy at the same time. I will be back for their tacos!!!

I love love love this place. This is not like your typical "bertos" Mexican food. Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious. Their tacos are amazing and have lots of flavorful meat and toppings. The papa nachos are super cheesy and spicy and great. Their esquites (corn with mayo and cheese off the cob)Barr delicious. The burrotote is really good and has lots of meat. They have delicious green salsa and the zucchini soup is amazing too! I've never been unhappy here.

They really need a sign.. We almost missed it! It is in an old and mostly vacant strip mall so it is easy to miss if you don't know what you are looking for. Delicious homemade ice cream in tons of flavors, cute cups to hold aforementioned ice cream, big TV playing Netflix, friendly family owned and operated, beautiful decor, and again, delicious ice cream. We will be back... Too often... Oh and the girl said if you fill up a punch card you get to spin a prize wheel (!) with prizes ranging from a small scoop of ice cream to free ice cream for a year. Loved it!

I loved the concept of this place! The red sauce was not my favorite, but the white sauce was delicious! You can get a mini pizza for around $5 with as many toppings as you want! The food would get 5 stars, but they lost a star for customer service. As soon as I walked in, the lady behind the counter was not friendly. I had never been here before and she did not seem willing to waste her time answering questions. The first thing she says to me is "red sauce and cheese?" I did not know what I wanted at that point, so I asked her if I could look first. She said "okay, but you need to pick a sauce." Yes, I know. She seemed to be in a hurry and there was nobody even behind me. Rude! They guy at the register was more patient and friendly. Overall, food was great and cheap and they have beer on tap, so I will be back. Just make sure you look over the menu before you arrive.

The green salsa was to die for! I could drink it. The tacos were good, but small. We had the braised brisket, pastor, crispy fish, and shrimp. The crispy fish was really good and fresh and probably my favorite. The horchata was the best I've ever had! Check this place out! Hopefully Mucho Macho Taco is here to stay.

Holy shit. These are the best donuts I've ever had. They are made fresh the minute you order them so the donuts were nice and warm by the time I got them home. The glazes are perfect. Not too sweet to where it overpowers the donuts and not too think to where you can't taste it. I got a dozen for 17.63. I think it said single donuts are about 1.80. I wish this wasn't so close to me... This could be dangerous.

Loved this place! Came here during happy hour and was immediately waited on. We ordered the torpedoes, quesadilla, and avocado egg rolls. Everything was DELICIOUS and half price during happy hour. The egg rolls were our favorite. They were crispy and filled with cream cheese and lots of avocado. The quesadilla was really good! Tons of chicken and cheese and came with this really good green salsa. The torpedoes were tasty, but I would've liked the jalapeños to be cooked a little longer. Some of them were not spicy and some of them were extremely spicy, which I guess happens with jalapeños so not really their fault. The waiter was very attentive! He checked on us probably five times during the hour we were there. We live close so this will be our new happy hour spot! There were so many appetizers that sounded delicious that we need to try.

I am doing a whole 30 (no grains, dairy, etc) and thought this would be a good place to get dinner that would fit in my diet. I ordered the chicken entree to go. It was grilled chicken, steamed broccoli, and came with a baked potato but I substituted a sweet potato. The chicken had fake looking grill marks on it and tasted sooooo bland and dry. The broccoli was fine, just steamed broccoli with nothing on it. The sweet potato was not actually a sweet potato. I watched the cook take the potato wedges out of the freezer and microwave them for two minutes. When I got home I doused everything in Frank's red hot. I don't know if i ordered the wrong thing or what, but I was not a fan.

This is a great coffee shop! I got the iced vanilla latte which I think is better than Lux. It was not too sweet and not bitter. Delicious. We got the banana jam muffin, poppyseed orange muffin, steal cut oatmeal, and the Parisian omelette. Everything was perfect. The muffins were still warm and the jams were all homemade. The omelette was tasty and a good size. Oh, and the decor was so cute! They have a farmhouse style going on that would make Joanna Gaines proud. Much more comfortable to sit in and enjoy your breakfast than Lux. My new favorite coffee shop in Phoenix!

Wow! What an amazing place! We got a lb  of snow crab with potatoes, sausage, and corn on the cob. It was all soo good! And so reasonably priced! It was about 22 dollars for all of that! We also got the cranberry mules that were so good. They tasted like cherry limeades with alcohol. And only six dollars during happy hour for a big mason jar full! I will definitely be back!

Their crust is nice and chewy and the sauce very flavorful. We ordered the margarita  pizza.... The cheese was SO GOOD. Definitely tasted homemade. My only complaint was that the sauce was a little runny, but it was very flavorful. My new pizza place!

Love this place! I had the carve asada tacos that were delicious. The meat was super flavorful and juicy. We asked the manager why they didn't have chips and salsa as a standard that you get and he brought us out four different kinds of salsa to try. They were all delicious! I would definitely pay for these salsas as a starter. He was super friendly and described all of the salsas to us as we tried them. You could tell he was very passionate about what he does. Definitely coming back here!
