We stopped by this Native for some wings and a beer. Not realizing there was a UFC fight on we decided we liked Native enough to fight the crowds. We walked in, were handed menus and told to seat ourselves. We found one empty table that was semi clean and very wobbly. We were greeted by our waiter who had no idea what beers were on tap. The menu has changed and you can no longer order wings individually, it is now by 1/2 or full dozen, and do not even think you are getting more than one sauce on the order of six. They did allow my husband to order two flavor but the amount of sauce was laughable. We were not offered silverware or napkins. The prices went up, many items were removed from the menu (no longer offering any pastas dishes). My daughter got the loaded fries which were half the size and hardly any toppings. I was very disappointed as we loved Native but we will not be returning to this location again.

Not only does this place provide bad service but the wait staff will alter your receipt. I left the other day with a very clear 0$ for a tip and wouldn't you know my bank processed a charge for $5 more. So if Andre serves you be ready for him to steal your money!

I took my kids when they were younger to Pueblo Peds and they were ALWAYS amazing great! They were speedy, helpful and always concerned about the care for my children. I highly suggest them!

Plan on waiting a minimum of 45 minutes to call and make or change an appointment. Once you get them on the phone they say oh we'll call you back. You won't hear from them so you'll call and wait 45 minutes again only to hear "we'll call you back". This place has NO regard for their patents time! As I type this I've been on hold 37:13 to change an appointment time.

Sandwich was good. Staff wasn't very friendly. Seemed like we were inconveniencing them to work.

Don't waste your time. The food was cold and tasteless. I was ignored at the "fresh egg" station,  while all the minorities were served because they spoke Spanish.

This place is horrible. The tables and floors are always dirty. There is also a weird smell on the west side of the restaurant. The staff is friendly but a little on the rough side looks wise. The food is either over cooked or cold and stale. I would suggest spending your hard earned money on the Chilis across the street.

The food here is AMAZING! The service is good. Staff is very friendly. Its always busy and be prepared to wait for your food, but once it arrives it was so worth the wait!

Our new rescue puppy had never been to a groomer before. We dropped him off and after 4 hours (he was a little pain in the bum for them) they had him looking so handsome! They shampoo'd him, cut him, trimmed his nails and did the glands. He looked like the cute little Shih tzu he should be. Even after he snapped at the staff, they kept at it until he fully trusted them. Made special efforts to get him comfortable with the noise of the clippers in order to groom him. I will most def be bringing our puppy back to Betty and her staff!!!

We tried this place for the first time on a Saturday night. Usually bar and grills are so busy you're lucky just to get your order taken, food served and a bill, NOT HERE!  The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. They took the time to welcome us and even gave us a free app of green chili corn bread for it being our first time (which was delicious by the way). The waitress was very good at explaining the menu and reminding us of all their weekly specials if we wanted to come back (which we will). I ordered the $10 grilled cheese and the husband orders the pulled pork sandwich. Both entrees were enormous and enough to feed an army. We had left overs for lunch the next day at a price that honestly could have been doubled for what we got.  I also ordered a grilled cheese to go for my daughter at home, which was prepared in no time.  Overall the staff, food, prices, beer choices and total environment are a total win for us. We will make this our new pit stop on the east side!

This place is over priced and tastes like canned pasta. The only thing edible was the bread and bottles beers. I spent 54 dollars on what tastes like a frozen pizza and spaghettios   Don't waste your time or money!

I love Haleys nails. She does the best custom back fills. They do great pedicures as well. This place is my favorite to get a brow wax as well. My only complaint is that she always booked and hard to get into. But when I can see her she never disappoints.
