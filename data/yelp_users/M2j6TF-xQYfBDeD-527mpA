The carne asada steak burritos are amazing and their shredded beef tacos are pretty good with the green sauce. The teenage boy who works here with jersey shore like hair seems very confused.I went to Rivas most recently on 09/23/13 and ordered the usual. After waiting 10-15 (drive-Thru) min to get my food the man who barely spoke English handed me 1 bag  with only half my order. I then asked for the rest and he came back with it but the churro fell out onto the road. He looked at it and said "oh sorry" and closed the window quickly. I waited there for another 2-3min waiting to see if he'd come back with a new one and he didn't. When I got home there were no sauces in the bags either. The girls who work there are nice and know how to do their job but the teenage boy not so much! My experiences here are always 50/50. The girls are great, teenage boy not so much. I'd give the food 4 stars and professionalism 2. I've worked years in customer service so maybe I have high standards but the staff can at least smile for once and act like they enjoy their job.

I have been going to Blair the past 2 years. She can make a cake for any occasion. So far she's done a birthday cake for me, my wedding cake, baby shower, and my daughters 1st birthday coming up. Her cakes are very moist, flavorful, and absolutely beautiful. Her prices are very reasonable too. All of my guest at each event were very impressed.  There isn't anything Blair can't do and I will never go anywhere else again but to her
