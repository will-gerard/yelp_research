Very frustrating experience.  I came here to get my passport photo done. I walked up to the counter that had a giant overhead sign that said, "PHOTO" on it. I waited for 10 minutes as I watched cashiers and the manager chit-chatting behind the counter. I kept smiling, but they just looked away. Talking about whatever they did over the weekend was much more important. Finally, I had to say, "Excuse me?!" rather loudly because of the volume of their conversation. The manager turned my way and said, "Oh! Has anyone helped you?".  Fast-forward a couple minutes. The manager didn't know how to properly take the photo. She didn't tell me when she was taking it, and when I requested to see the photos she said, "Oh. I already printed one." She made me wait then gave them to me, told me to go to the cashier's counter, and walked off.  My photo looks incredibly pissed off. Hopefully the consulate won't reject my Visa based on how angry I look, haha.  Overall, annoying experience. I won't be using this CVS Pharmacy again (unless, of course, there is an apocalypse).

Horrible experience at this Starbucks, all around.  We asked for a Trente Black Tea with 3 pumps of classic and 3 shots of honey. Llana, one of the workers, looked at us and said (very rudely), "We can't put the honey in your tea, so you have to do it yourself." Since this has never happened to us at any other Starbucks before, my boyfriend said that this is the first he's heard of that. Llana promptly responded, "Yeah, and we're probably the only Starbucks that has five health inspectors that come in here as customers every day. They work right down the road." As if we couldn't figure out what Llana was saying, another worker piped up and said, "It's a health violation."  To add insult to injury, it took them 15 minutes to make our drinks. There were 10 people waiting behind us and they only assigned one worker to make the drinks. I saw 4 other workers walk in and out of the backroom.  We won't be coming back.

Best restaurant EVER! I have been going here since I was two years old. The owners of the restaurant are family now. The service is always personable (even when we bring people that they don't know)! Also...the food is AMAZING. We crave it all the time. Get the tomato soup! You won't regret it! They are willing to help with any kind of diet restrictions :)  EAT HERE! NOW!

Had a great experience here, tonight! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place that was relaxing and yummy because we didn't want to cook. Perfect comfort food.  Service: Our waitress, Red, totally made our night. She is clever, funny, and sarcastic -- just our cup of tea. Ginger friends forever, we love ya! #hiddenginger  Atmosphere: relaxed, but nice. Come in nice clothes or casual clothes, no one cares. There is a private (ish) area for large parties and a full bar (yummmm).  Food: My boyfriend had the Blackened Chicken and loved it. I had the salmon and asked for it to be burned. The manager came out and actually had a discussion with me about how well-done I wanted my salmon -- awesome service!!! And they got it right! THE FIRST TIME! Absolutely amazing. This is the first restaurant to understand me.  Go here, eat here, have fun here. Great place!  P.S. You can color on the tablecloths. Coloring AND  eating! Can't get ant better. Get creative, people!

Despite my puny number of check-ins here, I frequent this Sephora a lot! There are a lot of reasons why I keep coming back.  First and foremost, I never feel like I'm being judged. As a social worker, I'm often on a budget. A very strict budget. So I usually hoard money and wait until all of my products run out, then go make a mass purchase. This means I often walk in without my "face". Even with acne, unadorned eyes, and blotchy skin, I'm still treated like I'm the most beautiful woman they've seen.  This being said, my second point I'll make is that they never beat around the bush. I love it when people are blunt and direct with me, and I usually get it here. I ask them a specific question, and they give me options and recommendations. This is greatly appreciated, as half the time I have no idea what to look for. I'm girly, but I definitely don't know all the "girl world secrets" every other girl in Scottsdale seems to know. I'm so out of touch with the barbies that inhabit this town.  Also, I have a lot of allergies (food, skin, medications, you name it). I'm allergic to fragrance, which really inhibits me in the makeup department. Did you know mascara has fragrance in it? I didn't. There's literally one mascara on the market that advertises being fragrance-free..and they sell it here! I had a problem with my eyelashes falling out. After describing my situation, one of the very knowledgeable workers informed me that all mascara has this pesky ingredient.  All-in-all, the staff are friendly, the store is clean, and they have options for my allergy-ridden body. Sephora for the win!

We had girl's night dinner here and had a horrible experience. This was one of the worst snobby waitress stories I've ever had the "pleasure" of telling.  First, we walked in and it took 10 minutes for someone to come to the counter to consider seating us.  Second, or waitress was a jerk. I wish we got her name, because I would call her out on here (just in case, she's a skinny, pear-shaped woman with shoulder-length, brunette hair with bangs and a mousy face). She was not very attentive. It was busy, but we had to ask her for water quite a few times. We ordered our drinks and food (which took forever to come out, we had to ask if they forgot about our order)--one of the girls didn't realize her salad came with salmon (to be fair, the ingredients aren't on the menu), so she was going to scrape it out. The waitress sighed and said she'd have them remake it. My friend tried to say it was ok, but the waitress took it anyway. For the rest of our dining experience, water was scarce.  Then the real problem came.  We waited 30 minutes after we finished our dinner to get our check. Our waitress told us that she doesn't split checks (we are not sure if this is company policy or not). When she brought the check back, we split it up so she could charge all of our cards correctly. She said this was fine. She came back 15 minutes later and told us that we hadn't added a salad onto our cards. We had ordered 3 salads total. She had charged us for 4. We told her her mistake. She said she'd fix it.  She came back and gave us our checks and we were ALL mischarged (most of us over charged). We figured out through the math of all of our receipts that she had charged us for the salad, but had split up the costs on all of our checks. We told her this problem, and she responded with, "This is why we don't split checks." We were very taken aback, but one of our girls said, "If you would have split the check, we wouldn't have had this problem." She rolled her eyes and walked away.  Lastly, the food was ok, but I don't like much American Food. There are hardly any vegetarian options and no vegan options.  I wouldn't recommend eating here and I will never go again unless I have to.

Go to Green! I've had problems in the past with servers, but I believe those employees have moved on from Green. Other than that, let me list the reasons why I love Green:  1. I am a vegetarian. It's nice to have a completely vegan restaurant--I don't have to worry about what I can/cannot eat on the menu! Also, the food tastes like vegetarian food. This could be confusing to meat-eaters, so let me explain; a lot of vegetarian options at places that serve meat are cooked like you would cook meat, therefore the taste is different. It's nice not to be overloaded with spices or sauce just because it's all veggie food.  2. The atmosphere is comfortable. Sometimes the music is a little loud, but it's definitely not as bad as a lot of other places around The Valley.  3. Take Out! This is one of my favorite places to grab food after roller derby practice! It's quick, healthy, and filling.  4. I have a lot of friends that eat meat. Not one of them has said anything negative about the food here. Plus, the people here don't look down on meat-eaters. One of my biggest pet-peeves is when vegetarian extremists think lowly of people that eat meat--you're giving a bad name to us other vegetarians! Calm down!   5. It's affordable. Yes! Affordable vegetarian food! Amazing, right?!  6. Have a Tsoynami. No, really. Trust me.  Personally, I think the food tastes better at this location than the 7th Street location. And, as mentioned earlier, there have been a couple of staff members that have been...well...rather rude. But they don't work here anymore, as far as I can tell. There's always a rotten apple, right? Except for the food. Nothing rotten about the food.  Go here! Every day!

My family and I have frequented Phoenicia for years (since they opened) and never had an issue. We have always gotten along with the owner, Sylvia, and the staff that have worked there. But tonight we had a completely different experience than we normally have.  My mother, father and I walked in and tried to find a place to sit - the place was crowded, like normal. The head waiter (who recognizes us every time we go in) told us he would clear off a table for us and asked us to wait outside. We waited for about 10 minutes and then another family walked in and they seated that family before us.  My father walked inside and politely told the waiter that we would come back another time. The waiter asked him why and my father told him that we were just going to go and that it was okay. The waiter (I kid you not) then yelled at my father, "What do you expect? All of our tables are full, man!" I heard this all the way from outside. My mother and I looked through the window as multiple people turned to watch. My father then said, "Don't worry about it, we're leaving".  A waitress came outside and told my mother and I that they had a table ready for us - my mother politely said that we were just going to leave because the waiter was rude. The waitress tried to get us to come inside again, but my mother repeated that we wanted to go because the waiter was rude. The waitress let out a long sigh, threw her hand up in the air, and stormed back inside.  We left. Sorry, Sylvia, you are a wonderful person - we miss seeing your face every day! I'm sorry to have to report such a poor experience. I hope we can fix this!

Alright, I LOVE Wildflower! I have never run into any problems with any Wildflower location...until now. Unfortunately, every time I have been to this location, the staff have proved their incompetence.  I moved close-by about 6 months ago because it was an ideal location for a foodie; Wildflower, Pei Wei, Pita Jungle, Postino, The Vig...so many good places within a mile or two of my place!   Unfortunately, I have mostly stopped going to this Wildflower location. I have them given many chances, but the end result is still always the same: my order is wrong, I tell the staff (nicely), staff proceeds to argue with me about my order, I stand my ground, staff gets huffy and reluctantly goes to change their mistake then my order takes forever to correct, and they begrudgingly give me my food after I've asked about it three times. I have waited up to 45 minutes for a correction to my order!  Needless to say, this has not dulled my opinion of Wildflower as a whole. The food is amazing and healthy! But, until there is a staffing makeover at this location, I will be hesitant to return. I will gladly wait until Sunday, when I visit my family, to visit the Gilbert location.  I gave this two stars because the food is so fantastic :)

Ok, enough is enough. I have given this location many attempts since my last review, but I'm at the end of my rope now.  The last few times I have eaten at this location I have gotten sick after eating the food. Today I ordered my usual--after I ate it I started feeling nauseated. I thought a nap would help, but my stomach hurt so bad it woke me up. This is gross, but needs to be said...I have been throwing up ever since.  I'm not sure if the staff has improved much, either. Every time I order they give me an apathetic attitude.  I appreciate everything the upper management for Arizona has done for me--thank you for being concerned and for all of your help! I am sorry this location did not work out for me because I love this company. I just won't be returning to this location. I will still attempt other locations, but I've had enough with the one on Indian School and 44th Street. It's just not worth getting food poisoning again.

I have had a lot of luck at this Coffee Rush location! The coffee is always good, the staff is almost always friendly. The setting is a bit hipster, but what coffee shop isn't these days? I like the little punch cards they give you, although I have a tendency to lose them. An app would be a bit easier to me. All in all, this location of Coffee Rush is enjoyable :)

Wildflower, how I love thee!  I have never had any problems with food or staff at this location. It is always very crowded, but staff works to find you a table and get your food to you quickly! The music is also at an acceptable and comfortable volume. Go here!

New Review  I would like to elaborate on my original review since I have received a reply to my reviews on Yelp AND Instagram regarding my opinion of the Garlic Festival. I have lowered my rating to one star because I believe things are being handled poorly. Let me further explain...  In my opinion (let's emphasize this word "opinion"), this festival was sorely lacking. I have been to other garlic festivals and I feel like a certain standard (that is shared by others I have spoken to since attending this festival earlier today) was not met. Usually when attending a garlic festical, the main focus is garlic - I felt that this was not accomplished. The garlic that was provided seemed like an afterthought. We tested a lot of the food that the Queen Creek Olive Mill was kind enough to provide me in a list in their reply - the garlic was usually in a spread or an aioli that was provided in a small dish and weak in taste. I also found more advertisements for beer on the tents than garlic.  The inside of the mill, at best, had garlic-stuffed olives. The main focus was olive oil, stuffed olives, and balsamic vinegars. My party and I voiced many times that we did not know where the garlic was hiding. Pickled garlic? Chopped garlic to put on top of our foods? Bread with garlic? Garlic-flavored or infused foods? Roasted garlic? Garlic salsa? Garlic kabobs? This is usually what you search for when at a garlic festival. None of this was provided here. This festival felt more like an excuse to funnel people into the mill to buy the products that are usually provided on days not throwing a garlic festival.  Now, to comment on how my reviews have been handled...I feel that they have been handled poorly. Instead of lashing out at a disgruntled customer, I believe an establishment attempting to keep a high level of reputation should attempt to fix the situation instead of reacting defensively. My review is my opinion, please take it into consideration as constructive criticism for next year's Garlic Festival instead of taking it personally. I am not attempting to be mean, I am simply doing what Yelp was intended for and providing my opinion of something I was disappointed in (an opinion that was shared by my entire party of garlic-lovers and many others I spoke to).  Based on my many experiences today, I no longer wish to give the Queen Creek Olive Mill a second try.    Original Review  My family and I went out for the Garlic Festival today, and we were sorely disappointed. We showed up expecting garlic and garlic-flavored things and garlic-infused foods. Instead, what we got was the exact opposite - NO GARLIC.  Now, when you hear the phrase "Garlic Festival", what do you think of? Probably what I think of - a bunch of people going to eat a bunch of garlic. I want the rank stench of garlic for miles around. I want people sweating and breathing garlic. I want mountains of garlic to throw myself into! What I got was sadness and barely a whiff of the beautiful stench I craved.  I'm sure the place sans Garlic Festival is lovely. I gave it two stars because the atmosphere is nice and the balsamic vinegar is yummy (however, avoid the Pumpkin Spice Olive Oil at all costs). Don't think I'll be redeeming my free Olive Oil Lesson, though.

I went to Ulta for the first time in about a year to pick up some hair care products. There was so much wrong with this trip that needs to be said...so, here we go!  First, when we entered the store, we passed about 6 employees on our way to the hair care products. Not one of them asked us if we needed help.  Second, after waiting and looking around, I finally found an employee (they seemed to be avoiding us). She just stared at me until I asked if I could get some help.  This is the worst part...I asked her about a type of product, which she gave me a suggestion for, but then started putting her hands in my hair and looking around. She told me I needed a good haircut and shampoo. I told her I got my hair cut a week ago, at which she wrinkled her nose and said, "Really?". I kinda stared at her for a second and nodded. She then proceded to tell me that my haircut is very choppy and frizzy and that she could "fix" me. I was so mortified--all I could do was stare at my sister (who was with me the whole time and equally as shocked). She kept running her hands through my hair, then told me she would get price quotes for me and come back.  Anyway, she never came back,  but I had already moved on. I got some very helpful advice from a blonde man working with the flat irons.  While I was checking out, I asked for the manager to tell her about my experience. The only thing the manager did was look mortified and tell me she would speak with the employee. This is a nice gesture, but I believe someone telling me I look horrible warrants a little more than an, "I'm sorry" when you work in a beauty supply store. Needless to say, Ulta did not make me feel pretty.  Of course, this was also the first time I decided to let my hair air-dry because I want to prevent damage, so I was already feeling self-concious.  I now definitely remember why I started going to Sephora. I will continue to do so.

I LOVE Jessica!!! I've been coming here for years and she does amazing work!   Atmosphere: Jessica and the other employees at Flair are polite an accommodating. They make sure I'm comfortable and always offer me a drink.  Work: As I said, Jessica does amazing work! I've never been let down. Not to mention she has great hair herself. I've never seen a woman walk out with bad hair (from any stylist).  Cost: The cost here is very affordable! I don't believe in spending $150.00 to get my hair looking fabulous--and you don't have to here!  Go to Flair! It's fun, clean, and relaxing. I will definitely continue coming here!

While I love Francesca's, this location definitely leaves a bit to be desired. Every time I've come in here I've had problems.  First, when this store first opened years ago, I applied here. I scored an interview, and the entire time the manager interviewing me kept grimacing at me and telling me that I'm not "fashion material". I didn't get the job.  Ok, fine, whatever. I had a bad interview 7 or so years ago. What about shopping?  No such luck. I decided to give this location another shot and go shopping here. Unfortunately, I couldn't fit in some of the sizes, so I asked one of the workers for a new size (the medium didn't fit, I asked for a large). She took the dress and scoffed, then told me they don't carry sizes "that large". I left immediately without buying anything and with a severely damaged body image.  I just went in a couple days ago, hoping both of these experiences would be a fluke. Nope. The girls that work here are still snobby and didn't offer me any help. When I asked a question, they looked down their noses and reluctantly told me the price of something.  Ok, Francesca's in Dana Park. You obviously don't like me and I definitely don't need you. Let's agree to go our separate ways.

My family and I have eaten here twice, now--I have to say, I have enjoyed it! There were a couple annoying little quirks, but the overall experiences were good.  The food is fabulous! They are very vegetarian-friendly. However, sometimes the staff you order from don't understand the concept of vegetarianism. We ordered our dishes with vegetable broth and specifically asked for no fish or fish sauce, yet when my dad ordered the kimchi appetizer they failed to tell us that it's soaked in fish oil. That's happened a couple of times--now we just make sure to ask about EVERYTHING. The portions are HUGE! Which is a plus for me (lunch for the next day is ALWAYS a plus).  The service can be good and can be bad, as previously mentioned. Some are very nice, but some just don't seem to "get it" (especially with the vegetarian thing).  The tables have a tendencies to be sticky or messy--I don't think they're cleaned too often between customers.  The water cups are TINY. That gets a little inconvenient. I started asking for two.  The atmosphere is nice, but a little loud on the music. We always eat in the back corner because it's quieter. It's always busy.  Anyway, overall I like this place and would like to keep returning! It has a few details that are rough-around-the-edges, but nothing that can't be worked around!

I have been to India Oven multiple times now, and it's so good! Sometimes there is a wait, but it's worth it!  The Food: Delicious! Even the buffet is good (and what I get almost every time), and I usually have a hard time with buffets.  The Service: The first couple times I went here, the service was hit or miss. Lately, it's been consistently better. They never let my water glass run out, which is one of my number one "things". The owner of the restaurant did take away some food I was eating once, but I don't think she noticed.  Plus: It's right next to a smoke shop. Score!  The Atmosphere: Kind of a modge podge of decorations, but fun and unique. It has a great bar setup.  Suggestion: Being a vegetarian,  I'm always worried about cross-contamination. I would suggest making the vegetarian food first on the buffet because some meat-eaters don't understand that the vegetarian spoon cannot touch the meat on their plate and then be placed back in the vegetarian dish. This is why I have rated it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  Conclusion: Great food! I would eat here every day if I could. Just need to switch the buffet and this place would be perfect!

I have been frequenting Oliveo Pizza since I started college--I graduated three years ago, and am still a loyal customer! There's a reason they don't get five stars, only four...but we will get to that.  First, the food is amaaaziiiing! The Greek Fries are (almost) literally orgasmic! I always order extra lemon sauce. Seriously, it's the best.  Second, they deliver. Sometimes it takes a while, but who cares? They're open until 2:00 am. Or do take-out. I never eat on location because there's only two tables outside and two chairs inside.  Third, I'd like to give a shout-out to Ryan. When he wasn't the one delivering my food or taking my order, I'd get disappointed. Ryan is on top of everything there and has never gotten my order wrong! Never!  This being said, a lot of the other guys HAVE gotten my order wrong. I think this could be because they are high (they certainly act like it). Call me snobby, but sometimes I hang up if it's not Ryan.  So...conclusion: go here, order from Ryan, get Greek Fries, take them home, enjoy your heavenly meal.

If you are looking for a decent OBGYN, look ANYWHERE else! I have had multiple appointments with three different doctors here, and each time my experience with MomDoc got worse.  The first time I visited MomDoc was because I thought my IUD was trying to come out. I had been to the ER and they told me to see an OBGYN, my friend referred me to MomDoc. Everything seemed professional and fine during my first visit. The ultrasound showed my IUD in perfect placement, so Doctor #1 thought that I had a ruptured uterine cyst. Later, during a second ER visit, the doctor told me there was NO WAY I could have had a uterine cyst because there would be "debris" in my uterus. There was none.  So, Strike 1: misdiagnosis based on uneducated guessing.  That brings me to visit number two...I came in for itching, inflammation, and discomfort (a yeast ingection). I had to wait for the doctor for 30 minutes in the exam room. I told her I have chronic yeast infections and that it was pretty much guaranteed that I had one. She took a look and said I had it. She prescribed me two diflucan pills. I told her in the past I have needed more than just two pills. She told me I "should be fine" and to call if it didn't go away after the two pills she was willing to prescribe.  Strike 2: they did not listen to me when I provided educated and informed knowledge about my own body (and then treated me like a child). Diflucan is an antifungal medication. Prescribing more than two pills is not the end of the world. My old OBGYN office used to ask me if I needed more diflucan every time I called them.  I went in the next day for another ultrasound because I wanted to make sure my IUD was in place (the first ER had told me it was definitely floating around, so I got paranoid) and they pulled me into an exam room. Doctor #3 asked me all the same questions the other doctors asked me and prescribed me with seven days worth of diflucan. I thought I was finally getting somewhere. She told me to call if the infection wasn't gone by the end of the seven days.  Fast-forward six days later...I called because my infection was almost gone, but I was going to need a couple more days (I can guage how much longer I have because I get thrush accompanied with my yeast infection when I have a yeast infection caused by antibiotics) because I still had a couple of spots on my tongue. After arguing with the triage nurse on the general line for an hour (she kept telling me I needed to see the doctor to fill a prescription. I told her I had been there for three visits in two weeks), she said she called the doctor and I should expect a phone call the next day.  The next day I didn't receive a phone call, so I called them. I had to argue with ANOTHER triage nurse, who kept telling me I needed an appointment. She put me on hold for an hour, then finally informed me that the doctor told me I had to go see my PCP. I don't have a PCP. The nurse told me to check with my insurance for a PCP.  I was so mad that I started crying. I told the girl on the phone that I will never be returning to MomDoc and she could cancel all of my future appointments. I told her it wasn't her fault and hung up.  I went to FastMed down the road. They gave me the diflucan within 10 minutes of being seen.  Needless to say, MomDoc is a place I will never be returning to and I will never recommend. I cannot believe how poorly I was treated and how dumb they tried to make me feel.

The only time I went here, I had a rather...difficult experience. We went in to get an application for my sister and, of course, some coffee. The staff member that served us looked like an Elvis impersonator. He informed us that Coffee Rush wasn't hiring, but that they could keep my sister's application on file. Ok, no problem.  We informed him that we would like some coffee. Throughout the time it took for him to take our order, make our coffee, and eventually hand over our coffee he kept staring at my chest and hitting on me while making fun of my sister. We left feeling pretty violated, frustrated, and insulted.  However, I have been to another Coffee Rush location and have not experienced this. I gave this two stars because I haven't had as horrendous of experiences at the other location and the coffee tasted pretty good (even if it was made by a pervy Elvis-wannabe look-alike).

I go to Salad and Go every chance I get! My family lives in Gilbert, so I stop by here first. I like it because it's the only fast food that's healthy! They also let me drop of flyers for roller derby :)  I get the Caprese salad with Gardien. The Black Cherry Boylan's soda is fantastic! Also, they have a ton of options for iced coffee--soy milk, almond milk, low-fat milk, hazelnut, vanilla, caramel...  Only one request...please, please, please open a location in Arcadia!

I went here the first night of my stay for RollerCon and I wasn't impressed...  First, the name is misleading for the atmosphere the bar has. It used to have some sort of "pub-like" name before it switched to this one. Honestly, the new name sounds like more like an adult store than a bar. So, it's still a pub, but with a weird name.  The food was bland and took (we kept track of time) over 45 minutes to deliver to our table. I asked two questions, both of which the waitress had to go ask someone about--one was if I could have a side of marinara. I know it's not common, but I mean...it was for a pizza. Plus, she had no knowledge of the menu or the bar (and she wasn't new, I checked--see, I give people the benefit of the doubt). And the drinks took 15 minutes (again, we counted) to make their way to our table.  The waitress returned a couple of times and did not clear my basket, even though I was done (I made this obvious). She was also short with us when we handed her coupons for the meal. She didn't even bring us our checks, she had another waitress do it for her.  All in all, not a great experience. I don't plan on going back.

My family and I have been to Burger Fi twice, now, and I haven't been particularly impressed.  The Food: They only offer two options for vegetarians that are not sides. Whenever I go (mostly when family is visiting) I'm forced to order the same thing. It would be nice if they at least offered a salad or something, for a lighter meal option. The saving grace was that the quinoa burgers actually taste really good!  The Service: When we walked in the cooks did a little sing-song greeting, which was nice. But then my family and I were figuring out who was on who's ticket and the cashier interrupted us (we were only talking for probably 30 seconds) and tried to delegate who was on what ticket. We all stared at her in disbelief. She then proceded to try and tell us that no, we didn't want to order what we ordered, we actually wanted something else (about our drinks, fries, and burgers). I finally had to tell her to stop and that we would order what we wanted. Another cashier got up and took the people from the back of the line, when there were obviously two groups ahead of them.  The Atmosphere: The music here is SO LOUD. We can barely hear each other talking, and that's the people in our group without hearing aides. Please, please, please turn the music down! The decor and seating are also pretty cool.  All in all, it would not bother me if I never returned, but it wouldn't kill me, either.

I stopped in here for lunch in-between meetings and it was fantastic!  The Service: The manager and waiter were very attentive! My water was never empty and they always made sure I was okay. They even brought me hummus and baklava to go with my meal. They were incredibly friendly and sweet.  The Food: I ordered the salmon salad. I asked them if they could blacken it, and they did! They even created a new spice mix for me--it was amazing! The hummus was creamy and made from scratch. Their baklava was sweet, but not overpowering. Everything was amazing. They have a large selection of wine that I wish I could've indulged in, but I was on the clock so I'll just have to go back.  The Atmosphere: This place is pretty fancy. Its very modern and clean. Beautiful interior decorating. Let's just say I was happy wearing work clothes.  Overall, I had a lovely experience. I will definitely go back again and bring some people :)

A couple of my friends came to eat here after an event--we were so surprised at the awesomeness! We all play roller derby, so we're always looking for places to eat that are relatively healthy. We were floored that a "Mediterranean Chipotle" exists!  The food was awesome, the service was great. They got excited that we were so excited! We literally asked for everything on our plates.  I'm a vegetarian, and there were more than plenty of options (good options, not just dinky salad options) for me. And they practiced good glove hygiene! Not to mention all the vegetarian stuff either had tongs or scoops!  All-in-all, we had a wonderful experience here and will definitely be frequent customers!

We had a VERY bad experience eating here for the first time. It almost seemed like nothing went right.  The service: During the course of our meal, the waitress got two of our orders wrong and mouthed off to me when I politely asked her to correct the mistake. She then proceded to complain about us to the sushi bar employee (specifically calling our table "those vegetarians"). The sushi bar employee then complained about our table to another waitress. I complained to the manager, Courtney, about this poor service and she was nice enough to give us three "I'm Sorry" free meals. Thank you, Courtney! You were the highlight of our overall frustrating experience.  The Food: everything was bland, watery, and burnt. The sauce didn't even have flavor. The aftermath of this is that we all feel like we are going to puke (including the meat-eaters in our parties).  Cleanliness: one of the waitresses spilled a drink on my mother and father (and their food). She was very nice and apologized for it, but then it took the entirety of our meal for anyone to clean it up. And we had to ask for napkins and for them to replace our meals.  Supplies: there were no lids for the To-Go cups.  Overall, this was a very poor experience. Even though we got free meals, we will not be returning. At least we have a funny tale to tell about the worst Father's Day meal we've ever experienced.

My sister has been coming here for a while now, and I have to say that we've been impressed.  The staff here is kind and attentive. There was a verbal altercation with an unhappy patient in the lobby (he was being stupid, not the tech's fault) and the techs handled him very well.  The doctor my sister sees is awesome. He knew what was wrong just by listening to her heartbeat.  The location is a bit difficult to get to. You have to turn in and find it in the back of the North side of the complex.  In conclusion, my sister will continue coming here. She even put in her application to see if she can be hired! Cross fingers!

PuraTea is my sanctuary! No. Really. My coworkers and I go here at least 3 times a week to get away from work for a few minutes.  The couple that owns PuraTea is amazing -- we love you guys! They always make you feel happy and comfortable. The tea is fantastic, and they're always willing to "tweak" their recipes when we decide to create new concoctions.  The owners are always trying new things -- they're going to try out an open-mic night and they came to our work's Wellness Fair. They're also expanding the amount of types of tea they have.  I've only seen one review for PuraTea that was bad, and they has some pretty conflicting information in their review (gender and name not included for privacy purposes).  All of this being said, they're amazing. Just go.
