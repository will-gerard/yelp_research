My dad purchased a rolling backpack for my son 5 weeks ago, last week the zipper came completely OFF (which was surprising since it was supposed to be high quality). I have the receipt and called the store to explain what happened and make sure I could exchange it. The Manager told me that they will not take any returns or exchanges, for ANY REASON beyond 30 days no matter what the circumstances. This was an expensive backpack and the nature of backpacks and luggage is supposed to be durability. Not exchanging defective products beyond 30 days is fine in some businesses but if these products are falling apart after 5 weeks then it's a problem. I am very disappointed in this store and would not recommend buying anything from them. Stick to the larger stores with better return policies or you may be stuck with the same issue! :(

These gentlemen did a wonderful job on my carpets, they were friendly and professional. They were available to come out on very short notice, quoted me a fair price and stuck to it. I will absolutely use this service again!! :)
