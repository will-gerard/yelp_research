BEST WINGS EVER!!!!  During happy hour, they have $0.50 wings!! They have happy hour everyday and it usually starts around 2pm and ends around 5pm most days. They have happy hour all day Sunday. Their wings are a good size, totally worth it! They have a variety of flavors. I typically get the hot. It's the perfect hot sauce. It's hot, but not too hot. They are fried to perfection!   Their service is great and so quick!  The staff is so friendly! They bring your drinks right away. There isn't any waiting for someone to check up on you. They come by often and make sure you're enjoying everything. Even when I come with a big party, like ten people, we still get the same quality of service and the food still comes out fast!  10 out 10 would recommend these wings to a friend!

I am a more than frequent Starbucks drinker, and I've been to many Starbucks. However, I have never felt so annoyed with their staff. This was my first time at this location and I didn't like that it was outside only seating. We live in Arizona, and it's too hot for that!   Also, I have been a Starbucks gold member for years! And for my other Starbucks lover out there, you know you get free refills of regular coffee and tea. Well, when I asked the barista about the refill, she she said that it wasn't an option. I thought maybe she was a newer employee, so I explained to her about how the refill works.. While I was talking, she just kept shaking her head no and saying no.. While I was still talking. On top of that, she ended charging my card for the full price of the drink instead of a refill. I will probably never go to this location again.

I ended up at this place for lunch with my parents one day because my mom had some kind of restaurant.com certificate to use before it expired, so she decided to try this place out.   When you walk inside, it doesn't feel like your at a Chinese restaurant, it looks like you're at some kind of biker bar. The decor and the food definitely clash! The way the restaurant is setup is very awkward. We sat in a booth in front of the bar, and I think it was the only booth on that side of the restaurant. It was strange because it wasn't even against a wall, and it was facing a door.. I felt like they just had a booth and needed to put it somewhere.   As far as the service. It was very average. Our waiter came to our table the normal amount of times. Refilled our drinks a few times and brought our food.. Nothing special..  However, if this review were solely based on the food itself, I wouldn't give it any stars. First off, I ordered a whiskey sour since my dad was going to have a beer. When it came, it looked like a watered down ginger ale. And it tasted terrible! I don't know what they gave me, but it was gross! I told them that the drink tasted different from what I'm use to, so they brought me a margarita. It looked and taste the same as my previous drink, so I stuck to water after that. When the waiter came to take my order, I ordered the honey chicken, and it was basically sweet and sour chicken but with honey sauce instead of the sweet and sour sauce. But the sauce on the chicken was way to thick! It made my food pretty soggy fairly quickly that I didn't even finish my food.
