After months of seeing the girls in the office enjoying what always appeared to be fresh pasta, I ventured into La Famiglia last week to finally give it a try - and am kicking myself for not going 8 months ago when I started working in this area!!    The wait is a little long for lunch, so don't go expecting something out of the microwave and in your hand in 5 minutes.  It is all made/baked to order and takes a little more time.  With lunch specials of pasta, side salad and a drink for $5.95, it is well worth the wait!    Last week I tried their Italian Hero sandwich, it was so good.  I had always been a fan of Cousins Subs and didn't think anything would beat their Italian - until I had it here.  Today, I tried the stuffed shells.  Again, delicious.  Cooked to perfection and the flavors making my taste buds want more and more.  My only gripe would be that they don't give you any garlic rolls with the lunch specials, and they are much needed for the sauce after your finished the pasta - no note to self, next time order a side of them!   I look forward to tasting each and every item on the menu in the next few weeks.

After relocating from another part of the Valley, I spent weeks looking on my morning drives for a new dry cleaner and after some research, was happy to find a Delia's close to my office, as well as a 35% off coupon and dropped off 14 items for services.  I then actually received a coupon for 50%, which I gave to the very nice guy who was checking me out (and happened to be the one who took my clothes when I dropped them off as well).  He figured out my discount and when he told me my total, I thought he must have done something really wrong, because it came out to almost $68- AFTER a 50% discount!!! I have never paid more than $3 an item to have (clothing) dry cleaned.  When I dropped off the items, I did think it was odd I did not have to pay in advance or that I didn't receive an itemized receipt showing what I left, and now in hindsight now I know why - they're being shady in their overcharging!! I have emailed their corporate office and am hoping to hear back ASAP and that they reimburse a portion of the extortionate fees and start making customers better aware of their prices as well as services avaiilable.

A friend ordered us delivery from Divito's shortly after we had our baby. First, I was shocked at how inexpensive dinner for two with salads & bread, delivered was ($18) and when we sat down to eat, it was delicious!! I couldn't believe living in the Arcadia area for years I had not heard about this little place, that delivers too.   My only dislike is the last two times I've wanted to order, they're closed. Sunday is understandable, but a Saturday evening at 7:30? Maybe b/c it's a holiday weekend.

Words can not describe the great experience one will get from dining at FnB - you are welcome from the moment you step in, it is a fun and bright atmosphere (the floor is amazing!) and the staff is top notch.  The food is fresh, local, prepared with love and leaves you wanting to sit and sample it all.    So instead of reading about it - get your butt(s) to FnB and try it yourself!!

Being the foodie that my husband and I both are, how we didn't know about this gem long before now still surprises me.    After talking about it with some friends we finally ventured in last night for happy hour and I already can't wait to get back!  Their happy hour menu was great - $5 pizza's, wings, bruschetta and more.  Upon talking to their GM we learned that all their pasta is made fresh in house and a lot of their ingredients are imported directly from Italy.  In our short talk you could tell that there is a lot of thought going into how everything is organized, prepared and made and they care about customers' feedback.    I couldn't believe how quiet it was for a happy hour though and it made me think about how many people probably don't even know it is there.  Even though it is located in Barney's, that atmosphere is welcoming to anyone - there is no pretentiousness.    I hope more people find the elevator at the Valet entrance for Barney's, take it to the second floor and experience the quaint restaurant for themselves.

I have also had the pleasure of traveling to Italy and experiencing authentic Napoletana pizza.  Until my first visit to Pomo a few months ago, I thought I was going to have to go back to Italy to enjoy it.    Their selection of fresh ingredients was making the decisions hard to narrow down, so our waiter recommended a bottle of wine.  It was the Santa Cristina, a sangiovese from Tuscany.  He explained that it wasn't the most expensive, but had a wonderful flavor that really went well with the pizza - and he was so right!    Being a simple person, I had the margarita pizza, while my friends each tried a different one.  All were equally delicious, pending one's taste buds.  The Santa Lucia has a wild broccoli, which tends to be more bitter than usual, so keep that in mind when ordering.  It wasn't for me, but if you like wild greens, you would love it, so my friend tells me.    The price points for what you are getting are very fair as well.  Being that Pomo is located in one of the more upscale shopping centers (where unfortunately with the downfall of the market has closed a number of the smaller shops located near by as well) it may scare away a lot of patrons thinking it will be too pricey, but don't be fooled.  Dinner for two, with a bottle of wine could easily be done for around $50 and it will leave you full and wanting to come back to try all the selections you didn't get to try this time.

A huge disappointment.  I had been looking forward to getting to Iruna and experiencing what I thought would be an experience to all the good food, service and times once had at Sol Y Sombra.  Joke was on me and my friends!    I would give the service 1 star, but because a few of the dishes were very tasteful, I am giving two stars.  The waiter was nice, but did not belong in the service industry.  He called us "dudes" (I wasn't on the beach and he wasn't wearing swim trunks, no need for "dude"), he kneeled on the table bench directly behind us, basically breathing down my neck when he talked (gross), never asked us how the food was, even when we didn't touch more than 2 pieces of the calamari (that was saturated in oil and desperately needed a few squeezes of lemon).  He took dishes away that we were not finished with.    The food was good - some dishes were great and some were not good at all.  The romesco sauce served with the croquettas was delicious! I could have eaten just a side of the sauce alone.  It has just enough spice and the flavors were spot on.  The trout was another delicious dish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and everything on the plate hit the palette in all the right places.    The calamari was awful.  It was over fried, and instead of serving with a lemon wedge, was served with a citrus aioli - the concept would have been great if worked with the dish. Even after taking the lemon from my water and squeezing on the dish, it was not appetizing.  If you check them out online and want to go try them for happy hour - sit at the bar (maybe on the patio, I didn't ask) but we were seated in the actual dining area and then told the HH menu was only available at the bar.  No biggie, but not the best way to attract repeat customers.    The space itself is very nicely decorated, it was comfortable and had a lot of details that worked well with the rest of the decor.    Overall, I think they did a great job with the space, if they tweaked just some small things with some of the food items, they could make them much better and as for service - contrary to popular belief, just because you're in Scottsdale, doesn't mean your staff should be wearing Ed Hardy t shirts and calling customers "dude".

Wow.  It had been a long time since I was so excited to try something.  Our original dinner plan was to order Chinese from China Village & run across the street for a drink at Shady's while we waited.  We lucked out big time!  The parking lot of China Village was full, so we went right to Shady's and were introduced to Short Leash.  All it took was one look at the menu and I knew I would be hooked.  I was tossed up between the Aiko (mango chutney, jalapenos, red onions, fresh cilantro and mayo) or the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions and fried pickles) - but went with the lady.  I have not stopped thinking about the deliciousness of that dog since it touched my lips.    Speaking of fried pickles - I have always loved them, but the fried pickles from Short Leash were hands down the best fried pickles I have ever had.  I need to find out what they put in their batter to give it the spice and crispiness that lasted through the entire meal - no soggy pickles in the end.    So if you're a hotdog fan or even if you're not (they will convert you!) find them on Facebook, track them down in the Valley and get some goodness!!

I was tossed between 4 or 5 stars because I didn't have a main course, but based on the appetizers, desert, wine and service we did receive, it was all 5 star worthy!   We started with the Caprese and the 3 baked cheese tarts.  The Caprese was so fresh and delicious!  I don't like tomatoes, but they looked so fresh and juicy, which my friend confirmed and gladly ate them all.  The tarts were all perfectly sized for two people to share as an app.  I was intrigued by the Triple Cream Brie with Proscuitto roasted tomato pesto and basil. It melted in your mouth and sent your taste buds into a party frenzy with the wonderful flavors, but to look at it you would never guess the ingredients.  The fig tart was like a mini pie, very flavorful and had the perfect fig taste.  We were full after sharing just the two apps, so decided to enjoy our wine (a nice Malbec from Argentina, can't go wrong!) and then try a desert.  We went for the Cheesecake De Jour.  It was a cheesecake, topped with a thin layer of cream cheese and fresh berries in a prosecco sauce of some sorts - it was to die for, but not in an over rich way.  I could have had another slice!  It was also sized large enough for two people to share and enjoy, without over doing it.    I am looking forward to getting back and working my way down through the menu, as well as the wine list.  I am big fan of local AZ wines, and really like that many places are supporting their local wineries these days.  Now if only they would bring in more than Arizona Stronghold....but not a reason to drop a star!

I happened to meet friends here on Saturday evening, and overall, I like the design.  It is simple and not overly tacky.  They are definitely in their opening stages, there was only a few printed menus, they were not serving everything on the food menu (if you can spend millions on a place, spend a few extra bucks to print menus for your opening if you're not offering the full menu), and the bartender abilities were a joke.  The Jefferson - a great cocktail if executed properly.  It is supposed to be cucumber and basil muddled with cucumber infused vodka (they use Effen Cucumber) and topped with a splash of soda.  They put one basil leaf in to muddle.  When you make a mojito you don't use one mint leaf, what makes a person think that one basil leaf in this drink is going to give any flavor?!  Needless to say, there was absolutely no basil taste at all, which was disappointing.  The drink was bland to say the least.  I asked for the black pepper, added a few shakes and had the bartender shake it up again - much better!  The staff was polite, in a "we think we're the shit" kinda way.  The waitresses all huddled at their staff spot at the bar flirting and chatting with the bar backs and bartenders pretty much the entire time.  It was early enough so it wasn't that busy, but it was overkill to have 10 employees crammed into the bar space.    I ended up here again the next day, when my same friends (they're guys, so naturally the fake boobs in this place are doing what they are intended to do and draw in the customers) decided to have a few before we hit a show.  This time we had A.J. as well as our bartender and he was great.  He entertained, he paid good attention to all of the customers on that side of the bar, if you asked him for something you got it (the blond, not so much, I think every time someone asked her for something, she looked at them like they had 2 heads and when I asked for a napkin after not getting one when served my food she looked at me with a blank stare and said "you need a napkin?" to which I politely replied, "I'm not exactly going to use my arm to wipe my mouth...")  The food is OK.  I think with time they can perfect it and have some great plates.  I ordered the wontons and they were cooked perfectly and tasty.  I also ordered the shrimp and green papaya salad.  It was tasty, the shrimp could have been cooked just a bit more and the dressing was a little tart and needed to be just a tad sweeter, but overall it was tasty.  A friend ordered the ribs and wasn't too keen on them, but did say the chicken lollipops were great.   It was disappointing to ask the staff how something was and have them reply that they haven't tried it.  To me, part of training is the food sampling.  A staff member should always be able to explain an item on the menu and know what it taste like.    So overall, it is exactly what you would expect from a lounge in Scottsdale.  If you enjoy that scene, you will love it.  It's a good place to chill and have a drink on a Sunday afternoon (which, BTW, if paying $12 for a cocktail is a bit much, on Sundays you can go for HH and get half priced drinks and $2 off all food).

I had the same problem as another Yelper.  Susan started out awesome, our pool was crystal clear and she was cleaning it weekly.  I noticed a problem around the beginning of August with Algae growing and let her know. After some research, i learned that algae growth is likely from the pool no longer being shocked each week.  The following week, I was home when she came, she didn't bring a brush and the only thing she did was throw a few tabs into the chlorine dispenser and left!! That is not maintaining a pool.  As the algae issue grew, we went ourselves and purchased a brush to try and get the pool cleaned and let her know again the issue was there and getting worse.  At the same time the pump was not working correctly (to us - we are new homeowners and are still learning how the equip. works).  I exchanged a few text messages with Susan letting her know, she was going to come check it and she suggested she come show us how it all works to which I replied yes.  I also checked again when I got home that night and it was still not working, so I let her know and never received a response and no one ever came to look at it.  The following week, the same problem.  No one had been to the house to clean the pool, so I texted her letting her know I wanted at least half of my money back for August since they had not done their job.  No response.  The next day I went to put in tablets that I purchased and noticed that someone had been to  our house and put tablets in - but again didn't do anything else.  No one even showed up the last week of the month.  I have yet to receive my refund, and I will be going to the authorities at this point.  I would not recommend at all.  We are now having to pay someone to come clean our pool, do an entire re-evaluation of the equipment and fix the leak on the pump that was supposed to have been fixed by Seablu twice already.

I took my Mom here for a painting event and was excited to try a new place not too far from our new house.  The service was mediocre.  The margarita was tasty and I saw that they serve a massive sized one as well, but only had the normal.  We ordered the cheese and spinach dip, but the spinach was not cut up at all and made it difficult to get the dip on a chip without it dripping or falling off. It was happy hour when we got there, but the menu didn't say what  that included and the bartender didn't let us know either, so I just didn't bother ordering anything else.  Doubt I would go back.  It wasn't terrible, but there are much better executed Mexican restaurants I would travel to enjoy.
