Our jewel in the Desert, this place rocks.  I have been here during the day exploring the various gardens, in the cold of winter enjoying the Nochas de las Luminaria, and now, a wedding reception in the outdoor pavilion.  You really cant ask for a better venue. Surrounded be acres of desert foliage, this serene oasis provided the perfect background for the bride and groom.

Curbside check in at economy parking lot 4 was a breeze thanks to Blake.  Parking on floors 1-4 was full but there was plenty of parking on the higher floors and the elevators down to the sky tram were speedy. After that,  the wait for the sky tram was one minute.  We breezed through security and their new radio wave body scanner in a little over ten minutes, with the TSA officer being friendly and wishing us " aloha" since our destination was Kauai.  Restrooms were also clean and centrally located. A quick  bite to eat at the Pei Wei, on we were off.

Wife and I had the babysitter for about another hour on a Saturday night about a month ago so we decided to have a glass of wine.  It has been about three years since our last visit.  Were were greeted quickly, given ice cold water and enjoyed a great glass of Pinot in a nice large glasses.  There was also live music that was not too loud.  The server (?owner) checked on us often and was very friendly but not intrusive.  There were mostly couples and the place had a good mellow vibe.  I cant wait to go back  and try their food menu.

I heard they had Moscow Mule copper cups on sale-- and indeed they were prominently displayed at the entrance of the store.  Done deal! In and out in five minutes.

This is my go to place in Ahwatukee mostly because they actually know what they are talking about concerning my hot tub.  They never try to over sell any item. In fact, they recommended baking soda once in order to raise my pH instead of buying their chemicals.

Real easy to make an appointment, their phone was answered by an actual person, and there was no "push number one, push number two" jazz.  Parking is super easy, the location in in the Frys / Subway area.  I was taken to the back and greeted warmly by any staff member that I ran into.  The first precursory background check was easy and painless.  The " real " exam by Dr. Pratt was efficient and to the point.  As a health care professional myself, I don't want to spend all day in his office.  I was in and out in about 60 minutes.

Came here last Friday for a routine rotate and balance.  I was greeted quickly, very courteous customer service, and payed my 40 bucks.  So far so good and a third of the price of the dealer.  They called me at home in less then an hour to pick up my car.  I was given my keys very quickly and thanked.  Boy, what quick and efficient service.  I then inspected the car.  They never rotated the right side tires!! After initially denying that they forgot to rotate the tires, they changed their tune and quickly took the car back in and rotated them.  Whats the point of going to discount tires if I don't have piece of mind that the work was done correctly the first time??  Do I really have to inspect the car after a simple, routine service?  What if my wife had dropped the car off, she would not have realized the car was not serviced correctly.  Finally, I had asked that all the tire pressures be set to 36 PSI.  The tire pressures ended up being 36, 39, 38, 37.  Sound trivial but these are very very expensive 20 inch run flats, so routine maintenance is very important.

I needed a tire rotation so I came back to this Discount Tires since it is very close to home. I had a negative experience in the past where I came for a tire rotation and they forgot to rotate the right side! This time, they marked the tires with a crayon so they wouldn't get them confused and everything went well. Simple solution and it seemed to work. Everyone was very friendly and courteous inside the store and I was in and out in less than 35 minutes. I  used their online appointment service and it seemed to work well.

Lets face it, skiing and all that is associated with it is pricey.  What I like about Ski Pro is they have the expensive latest items as well as less expensive last year items.  The sales team is  really helpful and available.  This is my go-to ski store in Phoenix.

DO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE.   We were sweet talked into changing our Century Link phone service to Cox Phone service.   The clueless tech fiddles with our phone for ninety minutes installing a huge phone modem in addition to our basic cable modem, screws up our fax machine, and has our phone number switched off.  When I had enough of his shenanigans and asked him to leave, he and his supervisor I demanded he call refused to have our basic phone service resumed. We are now without any phone service at all, and our business fax does not work.    DO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE.

After having dinner at the China Magic Noodle House around the corner, I suggested to our group of eleven a "field trip" to Lee Lee International Supermarket.  Everyone looked at me as if I were crazy to even suggest we go check out the supermarket.  As soon as we entered, everyone ran around like kids in a candy store checking out the different Isles based on ethnicity.  The kids had a ball grabbing all the Asian inspired candy their hands could hold. After we stocked up on Hawaiian Isle juice, Middle Eastern dessert food coloring, Indian Garam Masala and Heeng, some random Japanese flavored water, we left the store only to congregate in front and talk about how fun and kool this place is!

A buddy of mine were driving around when we happened to see Jason's deli. "Hey, when is last time you ate at Jason's Deli?" Neither of us could remember. But I do remember that the food was pretty good. Upon entering, we were the only two people on the entire deli. We got really lucky, or the food was not going to be good. I ordered a pastrami sandwich and my friend ordered a roast beef sandwich. Before long, the entire restaurant was filled and there was only about three empty seats. After about 15 minutes, people started receiving their food. I found that kind of odd, since we were the first ones in there and ordered a long time ago. I went to where that sandwich pick up area was, and they quickly apologized and said our food Would be right out. After another 5 minutes, we did receive our food. I asked them why it took so long and they just apologize and asked us if we wanted a free cookie. I said sure, I'll take two! About 30 seconds later, another gentleman came by and profusely apologize for the delay in food. By then, I had already eaten a quarter of my pastrami sandwich. It was incredibly delicious. After making some small talk, I found out this gentleman was actually the district manager. Long story short he made up for the delay in the sandwiches. Getting back to my pastrami sandwich, the meat was tender, not too fatty, and very well flavored. The sauerkraut and dressing was a great addition along with the bread. I would've preferred the bread to be a little bit more toasted, however that's my personal preference, overall it was fantastic. My friend had never had a pastrami sandwich before so I offered him a bite of mine. I thought to myself, "who has never had a pastrami sandwich?" Anyway, he found it delicious also.   Overall I would come back. The food was excellent. I'm not sure why I haven't been back sooner.

Not a worker in sight.  Had to ask for help twice before somebody finally came after 15 minutes.  Girl at checkout asked if i found everything ok.  I said no that Lowes only had one of three items i needed.  She only responded with a blank stare.  Poorly stocked also.  For example, 66 quart storage bins had no lids stocked.

Came here because I have to attend an outdoor wedding reception in the evening in the Arizona winter.  Having no idea what to wear, the staff in the mens department immediately helped me narrow down my choices.  They also offered to alter the length of my pants in one hour knowing I was in a time crunch.  The shoe folks were equally helpful. Now that is service!

You get what you pay for.   It is definitely on the expensive end, but the quality is the deal maker, not the deal breaker.  I challenge any other store to have the breadth of selection of all types of lighting. They even have the most gigantic selection of bulbs I have ever seen.

I often hear the phrase "let me take you to this restaurant, it has the best -------."  However, this time my friends really came through. I am always wary of the term best sushi, best restaurant, best this or that. However this facility definitely has the best sushi I've had in Arizona.  Hands-down. No argument. Located in a discreet location in a strip mall, the outside facade looks nothing special. Upon entering, you do see the fresh fish at the counters and the typical decore of a sushi restaurant.   Wanting to initially try out their seafood with as little gimmicks as possible, we started off with the poke. What a great choice, the fish melted in my mouth. Soft, delicate,  great texture, great color, excellent presentation. Next, we ordered three of their 90+ rolls. Normally, I am not a cream cheese fan in my rolls, however they use very small amounts. It actually mixed in surprisingly well with all of the rolls. Being the Yelp addict that I am, I like to take photos of what I order in order to post them. However, these rolls looked so delicious I forgot to take pictures of over half of our meal.  I can't wait to come back numerous times.

Three hours to match one quart of paint. Store is empty.  Counter person did not offer to expedite the order even after she found out I was ordering four other gallons of other paint also.  No wait at Home Depot.

Really a convenient option on the days that I am too tired to cook/clean up dinner for the kids.  The food is obviously healthy, fresh, and can be made your way.  There is a large variety of different proteins to go along with smoothies, cottage cheese, salads, salmon, eggs, etc.  A huge plus is they have soy milk.  If you workout early, breakfast is also available, and pretty wide ranging also with many choices.  Service is always super friendly.   Why the four stars? A bit bland.  Also, the espresso drinks are sometimes a miss depending on the barista that day.

Perfect for meetings where you need easy food.  Ordered Pizza online twice now with delayed delivery to suit my schedule.  No problem each time.  Pizza made correctly and  delivered on time.  Is it the best pizza--nope.  Easy to order, convenient, reliable, customizable--absolutely.  Sometime ease of convenience is worth more than taste.  Try getting fast delivery  or the correct order from the "better pizza" places.  I think not.

My tenant calls me on a Sunday at 2:15pm about the a/c being broken and the temp today is a humid, rainy 110 degrees.  She is not happy, the indoor temp is already above 80 degrees. I called Scott at 2:30pm based on the YELP reviews.  Scott calls me at 3:55pm with the repair completed.  Happy tenant.  Happy owner.  Reasonable price.  FIVE STAR REVIEW!!!

Went to buy shoes at the mens department. For those who are unaware, Nordstrom started out as mainly a shoe store. As expected, great selection. I told the salesperson my size, he brought out an alternate shoe since they were out of my size, no big deal. However, he handed me the shoe, said " let me know how it fits, and walked away. HANDED ME THE SHOE AND WALKED AWAY.    Nordstrom management I hope you are reading this.  Your Chandler store, I have come to expect poor service, lack of sizes, and poor selection, thats why I drive all the way to Scottsdale.

I decided to give Nordstrom another chance after the manager of the shoe department personally responded to my one star Yelp review.    It is the yearly Nordstrom sale and boy was it busy.  I have to tell you, I received first class service, mostly in the mens clothing.  I was helped by Taylor and ( I forgot his name, sorry! Tall, floating from Nordstrom Rack) and they were great!  I tried on about thirty different shirts and shorts, and they were helpful getting my sizes and offering suggestions.    I was even given a cold bottle of water when ( sales person whose name I forgot) recognized me in another department.

Coming here for the eight or ninth time for dinner, we knew the food would be fantastic, but more importantly, we were mentally prepared for poor service.   The Persian Room bills itself as a fine dining experience , but we know better, and thus were not expecting stellar service. Hence, when it took 45 minutes to receive the hummus / yogurt platter, we did not become upset.  The two types of yogurt were creamy, had enough lemon, and were quickly gobbled up by our party of eight. Drinks were brought out haphazardly and often forgotten completely.  The wine pours were the least generous I have ever seen. The specialty drinks were mixed well.  Sixty five minutes after we were seated, we were asked if we were ready to order. We replied that we we still waiting for our second appetizer, the Tah Dig.  They acknowledged that they forget and rushed the order.  It was, as expected, delicious.  The meat was cut with your fork tender. By now, the manager and two other people were trying to do good, comped our forgotten appetizer's ( we didn't ask)  and were falling over each other trying to redeem themselves.  As I mentioned, it was not a big deal since I expected the poor service knowing thr food would more than make up for the deficiencies.    The food is great Persian food, likely the best in Arizona and would probably rank high in the LA area also. Four stars are strictly for the food.   I keep coming back with the expectation of relaxing, let the mistakes happen, and enjoy the tasty food.

It seems like everyone I know has been to this place, so it was my turn to try the tasty kabobs.    All I can say is that I left this place utterly confused.  Service was all over the place ranging from ultra attentive to absolutely clueless.   Ordering was comical, our waiter had no idea what she was doing, and knew nothing about the menu.  They were out of multiple items including appetizer's and desserts.  The same goes for the food.  The chicken and beef were ok, yet the lamb was literally inedible.  The rice was delicious, but the pita bread was store bought and the grape leaves were from a can.  Prices are definitely on the higher end and not justified.  There are far too many better and less expensive Middle East places on  Apache Blvd as well as the Persian Room in Scottsdale for me to come back here.

"36 falafel and 40 grape leaves to go, please."  That was my to-go order at 10:00 am.  They were ready at eleven and our middle eastern party was a success in large part to Haji Baba. This is my go to place for sumac, filo dough, zatar, red powder dye for Knafa, baclava, etc. Service has improved lately.  Is it the best food? Nope.  The reason why I have been coming here for the last 15 years is because of the authentic feel that the store transmits.  That is difficult to replicate.

Four stars due to the generally very good but way too loud live music.  We were unable the hear the waitress or the other couple at our table.  Appetizer included very tender shrimp and fresh corn tortilla. The expensive guac was excellent as usual, but the roll up cart for the guac production would not fit in between the tables so we missed the " show."  The drinks at the bar were fresh tasting and refreshing considering the 110 degree heat. My mole chicken was tender, the sauce appropriately spicy. Churro desert was split between four adults.  Lots of chocolate and caramel, although churro was not crispy.  Overall fun for groups.

Easy massive parking lot.  Everyone greeted us with a smile and there were plenty of folks willing to help us.  My son decided his 2k dollar bedroom set we bought for him that was to last until college was "too baby."  Lesson learned. The teen section of bedroom furniture had numerous choices and the perfect price point--- cheap.    Dinner for both kids was 14 bucks.    Mission accomplished.   Everyone happy.

This is the place to eat a quick, tasty, asian inspired meal, especially if you are in a time crunch before enjoying a show at the Gammage.  In and out in 60 minutes, if you do it right.....  Located less than a mile from Gammage Auditorium, it is easy walking distance from the Gammage parking lot.    Reservations on show nights are highly recommended, and let them know you are seeing a show. A special card will be left on your table alerting the staff to be quicker than usual.      Season ticket holders receive a free appetizer, while single show ticket holders receive 10 percent discounts.    The food and service as mentioned in most reviews is solid. My only qualm is the use pf sauces can be cut on half and not compromise any of the dishes.

We came here to ice skate and check out the Christmas lights.   Self Parking: 30 dollars Valet: 40 dollars  Say what? That is more than Rockefeller Center in Manhattan!   We waited behind three busses of Ohio State fans who were blocking the entire entrance of the hotel. Pulling up to the valet, only one valet opened up the drivers door while the three other valets were standing around chatting.    The ice-skating rink was very beautiful, as usual. The ice itself was very well-maintained, with the Zamboni machine at the ready. Renting ice skates was a breeze, Although the quality of the rentals was quite poor. The staff was very friendly at the rental kiosk as well as on the ice. The surroundings were very beautiful. The holiday music was not too loud. They have bleachers for the family members who only want to observe and not skate. It would be nice if they have some type of lockers or storage area for the people who do you want to skate who have items such as purses, bags,  or purchases from the gift store.  The seasonal holiday train which takes you around the expensive resort grounds was very pleasant and fun, lasting about 10 to 15 minutes round-trip. The Fairmont Hotel does a fantastic job's with all their holiday lighting. The line however can become very long. We waited about 25 minutes but the line can easily be over an hour and longer prior to Christmas.    If it were not for the exorbitant parking fee I would easily rate this at five.  However, $30 for self parking and $40 for valet is plain ridiculous.

This review is for Barrett Jackson 2016.  This is my third year in a row I have attended this world-class event in Scottsdale Arizona. There are literally thousands of cars up for auction over a seven day period. Often, the auction is televised live on the Velocity or Discovery channels. Most of the cars are American, with a few British and German cars thrown into the mix. It is quite rare to see a Ferrari or any other Italian car up for sale at this particular auction.  The event literally draws people from all over the world including online.  Parking is fairly easy with the public parking/bus taking you to the main entrance. For those who want to valet, it is $30. There are dozens and dozens of food options located inside and outside the venue. The options range from pizza, fresh corn on the cob, sushi, to healthy Asian chicken salads. The prices are quite hefty considering what you are purchasing. That being said, you can easily spend a few days at this venue and I get bored.  The Cars sold from anywhere between $30,000 to $1.8 million. It's always fun listing to the auctioneer rambling and rolling along, only breaking his rhythm occasionally to provide interesting tidbit about a particular vehicle being sold.  Famous car enthusiasts were everywhere, including Richard Rawling of Gas Monkey Garage.  Bring your camera and enjoy!

Our gem of a grocery store in Ahwatukee where employees know your name and recognize your kids. It is always fun looking  for seasonal treats, and Halloween time is around the corner: pumpkin cereal, cake mix, cookies, etc. I cant think of a single reason to give this store anything less than 5 stars.

Ok, so I have been buying HP computers from Costco for as long as I rember, at least eight of them. About four months ago I purchased an HP laptop strictly for work reasons.  What a piece of junk.  I can live with the cheap plastic, etc--- heck, what can you expect for a 700 bucks laptop!  It frequently froze and then began running very hot. I was going to return it but by the time I got around to it I was two days over the clearly stated policy of ninety days. Oh well, my fault.  However, the final straw can when the battery died and refused a charge. I took it to Costco, understandably they were not happy but they actually refunded the entire price.  I spent a few bucks more and purchased a different brand.  They totally could have not done anything but went above and beyond customer service. I will continue to be a loyal Costco customer!!

I usually dont like writing updates but today I was shocked to see  that they had Poke, in fact, three different types. I ended buying two pounds of the stuff. It was really good. The fish was soft and mostly buttery with very authentic spices.  Occasionally I would get a chewy piece, but who cares! The Chandler Costco is a heck of a lot closer than Hawaii!

Very convenient location with lots of parking.  Staff is very friendly and all do an excellent  job of styling hair per your request. Equipment appears clean snd well maintained. The "MVP" includes a hot towel, wash, and back message.  Each chair has a TV with ESPN.  Prices are great. Only downside if they follow the corporate policy of no appointments which is a real  bummer.

Either I am in a foul mood or Subway is starting to lose its mojo.  They did not even know I was there to order, the roast beef tasted like cardboard, the tomatoes were full of fibrous inedible cores, and the onions were large chunks.  Lastly, the sandwich was only cut 2/3 of the way, so when I went to pick up one side to eat, it totally pulled the other side spilling the contents.  The staff appeared like they were in a casting call from Dazed and Confused.

Super Fast!! About a year ago had the keys changed in my rental and also fixed some deadbolts.  Prompt, reasonably priced.  No big deal.  However, last month, my tenant in Maricopa called, the garage deadbolt was stuck and she could not get to her car.  I texted her the number of A1 (I was just beginning a two hour meeting) and by the end of my meeting the repair was done.  I never even left the meeting!! Now that is service!!!!

What the heck happened to these guys?  This is for service that took place 4/2014. They used to be good, I have been using them ~5 years.  This time the tech (16Par on the service tag) almost got thrown out of my house.  He shows up and does not want to answer any questions about what he is doing to the under sink RO filter, and then he does not even have the correct tools to access my panel and has to borrow my tools.  He mumbles everything looks good after checking the water and then changes all the filters.  Why are you changing them if they look good? The panel was then not replaced correctly and I had to replace it myself.  How is this saving me time? I cancelled the rest of the service (water softner and two water heaters) and told him to leave.  I called Aqua science, explained the situation to someone and even texted them a picture of the panel that was not replace.  NOBODY called back to fix the issue, apologize, ensure us the filters were even replaced correctly.  DO NOT USE AQUA SCIENCE

Entering through large glass motif front doors, our hospital Medical Executive party of five and our medical staff lawyer were greeted by a number of well-dressed hostesses. One immediately notices how dark the bar and restaurant are.  Too dark for me.  The majority of the patrons were noted to be using their cell phones to read the menu. The menu is typical steakhouse with choices of steaks and seafood options. The appetizers were also very typical for a high end steakhouse: including tuna tartare, seared ahi, jumbo shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and shoe-string potatoes. The seating area including the tables, chairs and utensils are very upscale and remind you that you're in a fine dining establishment. The waiter, an assistant and the bus boy greet you politely and introduce themselves by first name. They have an extensive wine list as well as various bottled water options. We started off with the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous, slightly sweet, and came with horseradish, and cocktail sauce. They were presented over a bed of dry ice making for a very pleasant presentation. The tuna tartare comes out on stacked wonton chips and I believe microgreens.  It was OK. Nothing spectacular. The crab cakes were awful. The crust was extremely tough and peeled off the rest of the cake.  A knife was needed to cut it.  Flavor was nothing special.   For the entrée, I opted for the 8 ounce filet, along with their shoestring potatoes, and steamed broccoli.   In between appetizer and the main meal, they made sure to refresh the table, not leaving a single crumb on the table cloth. An additional nice touch, the waiter informed us at certain intervals about how long our main meals would arrive.  On a slightly negative note, we made sure to ask the waiter not to stack our appetizers along with the main meal, and he seemed to take some offense to that. Unfortunately, rushing the appetizer's and quickly bringing the main meal has been a fairly regular occurrence at a lot of the restaurants in Scottsdale.   The filet came out perfectly cooked medium rare, but had a very rubbery texture which I did not find appealing. It was not melting your mouth delicious but was fairly good. I was expecting a much stronger signature steak product. The steamed broccoli was just that,  steamed broccoli. The shoe string fries were very good. The portion was very generous and not too salted. We also order the mashed potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese. The steak plates came out extremely hot, as they should. However when the macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes were scooped on our plates, they begin to sizzle and became somewhat melted and runny. Not much you can do about that.   Service was very very attentive and our drinks filled no more than half a dozen times. Our used dishes were removed and fresh forks and knives were replaced as needed in a nonintrusive fusion.    I happened to be there for a business meeting along with five other people. I did notice that most of the people there appeared to be work colleagues, not families or couples.    Definitely worth the rating for service, ambience but not overly impressed with the signature steak product.

If you want to change the entire look of your home, change the front door. We went from a double wood entry to a custom iron and glass door that had our neighbors envious in the best of ways.   Ordering is a breeze.  The rep arrives at your home with door color palettes, glass choices, and examples for you to draw inspiration from.    Six weeks later we had our gem of a front door.  The pictures speak for themselves. The install was spot on.  Flawless, no mess, top notch.  Some of the finest craftsmanship I have ever seen.  Our only hitch was the glass vender had some quality issues which was taken care of by First Impressions.  Well worth the cost.

Nice Hawaiian atmosphere that has a Pacific Island theme that is not cheesy.  Super friendly service. You order at the counter and the warm, fresh food is brought to your table.  During the meal, they came a few times to see if we needed anything else.    We had the Rumbi Beach Burger and Sweet Potato Fries.  The burger came out on french bread, and that alone sold me. Filled with two patties, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, onion and house made thousand island dressing, it really hit the spot.  It had just the right amount of messy drip factor.  The fries were crisp, not greasy, and really satisfying.

Located in a typical strip mall, I've had this restaurant on my bookmark list for over a year.  It closes on weekends, making it difficult for me to visit. We arrived right after the lunch rush, and were greeted by two of the staff. The menu is small but appropriate for the type of establishment. It had falafel, shawarma, grape leaves, Mediterranean salad, and yogurt called Labni.   For appetizers, we decided on the grape leaves. After that, we ordered the falafel platter which included a Mediterranean salad, hummus and tahini dipping sauce.  We also ordered the lamb/beef shawarma plate and substituted the rice with Labni.  Their version of hot sauce, called schug, was also order for $.95 extra.  Grape leaves had a nice presentation but were served cold. The coldness made them firm, bordering on hard. They had a great spices mix and lemonony flavor. They seem similar to the canned grape leaves I have purchased many times before from Mediterranean establishments. Either way, they were tasty and I would order them again, but slightly heated.   The falafel were definitely good, crunchy on the outside soft yet not greasy on the inside. They were not great but they were tasty. The tahini sauce needed more salt. It did have a nice texture and worked very well with the falafel.  The Mediterranean salad was chopped very diligently and had a nice fresh taste and made a great addition to the falafel. The hummus was creamy but also need a bit more salt and garlic.  The lamb/beef shawarma pita sandwich was surprisingly light. Wrapped in a grilled pita along with Mediterranean salad, the meat was well spiced and not fatty. I substituted Lebni for my rice, it was thick and slightly sour as it should.  I do believe this lebni was store-bought and not made in house. Also, the pita bread, grilled nicely and definitely fresh, was just your regular, every day store-bought pita bread. It would be a nice touch for this restaurant to have a different type of pita bread such as handmade or fluffier pita bread. The surprise, for me, was the hot sauce. It was called schug, and had a nice strong kick. I added it to every bite I took of falafel or shawarma.   For dessert, we ordered the Malawach, a cheese- filo pastry that came with tomato chutney. It was extremely fresh, not over dry considering it was made with filo dough, and had a real nice savory flavor to it. Definitely a great way to end the meal.   Overall, very solid food, but not mind blowing. For sure, everything is extremely fresh, In fact they ran out of a number of items at the end of the lunch rush, which I respect. A restaurant should make their items fresh everyday.  I am looking forward to returning and trying other items off their menu.

Tempe has really developed the area, especially the last few years.  Depending on the time of the day, there is something to do for all age groups.  It is a stones throw to Tempe Beach park, parking is plentiful, and there is a nice variety of food with few chain restaurants.  At night, the bar scene is hopping full of ASU kids, keeping the vibe electric.  Gammage is within walking distance too.

I was so glad I actually had time to try this authentic Punjabi Indian restaurant located on Apache Boulevard. Outside, they have a number of rickshaws which make excellent photo ops, as well as a Tandoori oven. Inside, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a small, quaint restaurant with about a dozen tables. It definitely has that mom-and-pop type of feel. The menu is expansive, had wine pairings in the margins, and their spice scale is from 1 to 10. We started off the meal with mango lassi (really creamy and refreshing) and complementary papadum. Instead of the usual brown tamarind or green cilantro chutney, they actually have a third chutney that will make you sweat and clear your sinuses with about two bites.  We decided to order two meat dishes and two veggie dishes, one of each would be super spicy and the rest would be mild so the whole family including the kids could enjoy. We ordered: chicken korma, tava sabji, lamb curry, palik kofta, a spiced veggie dish, and two types of Naan. Basmati rice was included. All the food was wonderfully spiced and well balanced. Our two spicy dishes, which we had requested a seven, was too mild. The chicken and lamb were extremely tender and broken apart with your fork.   Speaking of forks, each place setting must've cost $100. All of the plates, utensils, and cups were handmade copper imported from India. The drinking cup would have made a fine Moscow Mule cup.  For dessert we received our free complementary house desert by checking in on yelp, as well as the ras malai. Both were fantastic and did not overdo the cardamom.   Service did feel rushed. Naturally, the place is small, so they want to turn the tables over quickly. They need to take a chill pill.   Additionally, another huge negative is that they are located next to a gas station were a lot of undesirables were hanging out. I went to check in my car twice just to make sure it was not broken into.   I definitely can't wait to come back and try more items from the expansive menu

It has been a while since I gave a restaurant five stars- everything really has to come together.  The five stars rating is based on two visits six weeks apart.    Initially after my first visit I though that perhaps it was the perfect spring Arizona weather, fluffy clouds, light breeze, the sunset sky with orange and purple hues that made the out door ambiance magical.  Our next visit in the throws of the summer heat was just as magical.    The hostesses greeted us warmly on both occasions as did most of the staff as we walked towards our outdoor seats.  Nothing in Phoenix, and I mean nothing, compares to the outdoor seating here. The candles, the trees, the shrubbery, the eclectic music, the misters, the hidden nook and crannies with hidden seating-everything just works.   The menu is essentially fixed with a few choices of salads and main meals.  The wine list is excellent.  Service is spot on and not intrusive. The price point is high but well worth it.    The food obviously is star as my photos will attest to.  I can not wait for my third visit.

The official temperature yesterday at dinner time was a record breaking 115.  Unofficially on my cars temperature  gauge: 118.  Our reservations for the outdoor back patio were appearing a bit foolish.  Would dinner become a sweat bath of uncomfortableness?? Upon entering the covered back patio that is surrounded by shade trees and bushes, the item one first notices is a large outdoor cooling fan.  ( see the below picture) THANK god!  The dinner temp was warm but very comfortable and a real welcome break from sitting and eating indoors.  Living in Phoenix since 1999, you WILL be stir crazy every August because the monsoon limits any outdoor activities.   The food, wow.... all the other Yelp reviews and pics are dead on.  We ordered the standard street corn "off the cob," the table side guacamole, and the fries.  For the main entrees, butternut tacos, Salmon, and the green onion duck were all full of flavor, delicate, had wonderful accompaniments, and quickly devoured by my hungry family.   Will very highly recommend.

Nothing wrong with hotel restetaunts, but they normally are not my cup of tea.  Gallo Blanco, however, breaks the mold. Greeted warmly by the hostess we were seated directly below a large fan. We asked to move, no problem, we were moved to our table of choice with a smile.   Our server ( ?Dre)  was very good, offering suggestions when asked, otherwise non intrusive and allowed us to enjoy our food. ( see my photos).  After drinks (an ok yet refreshing Sangria and a well mixed Henricks G & T with lime) we ordered an Ahi appetizer with guac and chips-- very light, thin slices of the tuna.  Then we  enjoyed a salad, the name I cant recall, which had corn nuts and again, a light vinaigrette dressing. Finally, we ordered a spread of tacos wanting to try a wide variety. The moist, flavorful carna asade taco was my favorite, with the fish and veggie tacos on hand made corn tortillas a close second place.  The special, a seared tuna taco, was my least favorable.  While it was well made and the fish tender and fresh, it was too large of a chunk and really should have been diced or sliced.  We ordered the Street Corn as a suggestion from our server, and wow was it good, spiced up, well cooked ( steamed??) with perhaps cheese on top. A great addition and actually should come automatically with any meal. It really is that good.   Feeling thoroughly stuffed, we split the orange cake along with fresh brewed decaf. The cake was full of orange flavor, zest, and the right amount of sweetness.  The ENTIRE bill for two was  73 bucks. Well worth it and frankly a great deal- alcohol drinks, sodas, appetizer, salad, five tacos, desert, coffee x 2.    Finally, kids below the age of 10 eat free.

Typical Starbucks located in a Safeway. There  is virtually no wait at this location as opposed to the drive thru location about half a mile further down Chandler Blvd near the I-10 which generally has a 15-20 minute wait. I was able to use an old five dollar voucher that I found behind my desk-it must be at least two years old. Score!  My iced Americano with soy was as expected.

Really tasty coffee without the burnt bitter taste of Starbucks.  Staff super friendly without a barista attitude of Starbucks. Only downside is lack of locations.

Time for youth football and a karate tournament. We quickly found cleats, sports back packs, sports shirts, pump needles, and replacement cue  tips. We were assisted by no less than four people.  Checking in on Yelp saved us 10 bucks!!

Best poke in town. Although probably the only poke. Seriously, I recently had poke in Kauai at a top 100 yelp restaurant and this  actually compares favorably. It needs a touch less soy sauce though, and macadamia nuts not in any poke in Hawaii.  ADDENDUM Owner sent me a kool email.  It is nice to know they care!

We came here to buy our new favorite rum from Kauai, which we imbibed in perhaps a bit too much during out recent vacation in paradise.  Unfortunately, they had every rum imaginable except for out new favorite rum from Kauai.  On the plus side, we were able to stock up on our red and white wine. Service, as usual was helpful. We also decided to buy ice buckets- you can never have enough ice buckets for parties.

I like fast cars and faster jet planes!    Having recently seen the air show at Miramar in San Diego, I have been bitten by the jet bug. Absolutely amazing to see these fighter planes up close and personal, talk to the pilots, and then watch the air show as the jets zip by with their afterburners blazing and the roar deafening.  Luke Air Force Base was very well organized, they had thousands upon thousands of parking spots with great directions. The walk to the actual show it was quite far in excess of a mile perhaps even a mile and a half. There were lots of vendors selling water for reasonable price of one dollar per bottle.  They must havehad over 1000 Porta potty's located everywhere.There was a huge selection of food vendors, and what I really liked is all the food vendors were spread out over the entire facility not bunched up in a little area. It can get pretty hot on the tarmac considering all the concrete. The highlight of the show was the reenactment of the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor including rebuilt Japanese Zero replicas used in the movie Tora Tora Tora, and P 52's. They even had B-17 bombers, and the MC made sure to tell the whole story of Pearl Harbor. I'm a World War II buff, and having recently been to Pearl Harbor, it was exciting to see this reenactment.  Another real cool thing on this hot day, was the use of rickshaws shuttling people back-and-forth to the parking lots. I'm not sure how much they cost, but for the elderly population they seem to really enjoy this perk.    The best part, the entire show was free!

Kool small joint, reminds me of the Mission District in my old San Fran hood.  Authentic street food. Cheap prices, strong salty Patron Margaritas. Insane horchata in  a huge glass ?40 oz???   Ridiculous slow service on Saturday nights.  Chips not salted but thats ok because of the kick ass salsa collection.

Let me start by stating a plain and simple fact, "I hate walking into banks."    Honestly though, this is the one branch that really, really works hard at making you a satisfied banking customer.  Normally I do everything using the BofA iPhone app, however, I needed to deposit a check that exceeded the allowable amount, thus forcing me to go into a bricks and mortar bank.  The manager greeted me by opening the door and also wished me a happy day upon leaving.  The teller explained to me that the app has customizable deposit limits and agreed with me when I voiced my frustration of having to actually enter the bank rather than then doing all my banking from the comforts of my home office.    The bottom line, if you have to go inside a bank, I recommend this branch. Go figure!

If you need gas, I suppose this place is ok, but I consider this my back up of my back up gas station.  Usually not the cleanest, often the pumps dont print receipts, and the "no touch" car wash is only ok, leaving lots and dirty areas. Inside the mini mart, it does have a really kool LED lit candy rack.

How can you go wrong for five bucks.  The kids love it, there is never a wait, and its close by.  The pizza is consistent. I certainly can not complain about a five dollar pizza.  Why the high number of stars if the pizza is only ok?? Convenience, convenience, convenience.

The best part about Panda Express, unfortunately, is the location with plenty of parking.  The food looked tasty and appeared fresh. Taste was very uninspiring.  The egg roll was mushy and the  fillings were difficult to discern.  The veggie spring rolls were crispy on the outside, the insides were mushy and pasty. The pictures on the website look like different products.  The fried rice was oily and flat on taste.  The orange chicken was heavily sauced and felt  oily also.   Overall an unsatisfying heavy greasy meal that does not hit the spot.    The facility itself was clean.  Ordering was easy and organized.  The menu was easy to navigate.    A huge plus is they have the calorie content on the menu and their website.

Tony came out and found a roof leak effecting my windows!!!  I fixed that first and had four HUGE windows replaced.  The location of the windows would have made any installer cringe--close to a hot tub and the other in a narrow alley way.  They never complained, were VERY clean in and out.  He said I would love the windows and I do!!  Seriously, they block the heat from coming in, do not allow the a/c from escaping, and dont require sun screens.  Totally worth it.  I am saving up to replace all the windows in the house now.

Watch the noodle man make your noodles from a large plexiglass viewing area. Talk about delicious noodles with texture, chewiness, and your choice of six different cuts ranging from thick to thin to chunks.  Without the help of Yelp our party of 11 would never have entered this place.  Slightly intimidating because it is so authentic, one of my friends actually told the server he was lost about the menu and if she could  help him order.   We ordered noodles, pot stickers, veggies galore, rice, etc. All of it was loved by the group with us all sampling everyone else's dish.  The surprise of the night was the Corn Noodle Shrimp dish which turned out to be the big hit.  Hints of curry combined with the fresh noodles was a flavor dream.   Service was friendly and accommodating.

Vladimir is awesome.  We have a stacked washer dryer that is built in with cabinets surrounding the units.  He helped me remove the cabinets and heavy granite, completed the repair as stated, and left no mess.  Very easy to reach and work with.  I would highly recommend.

Texted them because I had their cell number from a previous job and we quickly established an appointment for the next day. He texted me when he was on his way.  The issue was quickly diagnosed, and he even showed me the broken part that was clearly damaged. I dont know if the prices were high or low since I did not have time to shop around but to me the peace of mind is well worth it.  Third time using them and I would recommend.

Arrived on time, actually early.  The part was replaced quickly. Another company had misdiagnosed the problem as the motherboard. Four stars for the price, and causing cosmetic scratches on the unit. Placing it on a towel during the repair would have prevented the scrapes.   I would definitely recommend and use them again.

The Italian Festival next door was providing classic old school Italian music while we enjoyed a fresh lunch on a beautiful Spring day in Old Town Scottsdale. The open air restaurant upstairs had live music and a nice vibe.   Deciding to eat at the downstairs deli, we were pleasingly surprised with the quality of the "deli" food.    The Butternut squash enchilada  made with a corn tortilla, fresh corn and perhaps gouda cheese really hit the spot?  Next up was a Turkey-berry -jalepino-brie-arugula sandwich that sounds like a mouthful but was actually quite light and delicate. The Gouda mac and cheese was not good at all, in fact very dry.   We ordered a number of sides: the Szechuan Green Beens had a nice crunchy kick, and the Edamame Salad and Roasted Cauliflower were both fresh and filling.  It was a hot day so having Orange San Pellegrino was a treat. The deli is  not full service but they gladly gave us extra plates and removed our dirty dishes.

Our party of nine was promptly seated in the back room per our 6 pm reservation. Having never sat in the back room, I was pleasantly surprised at the wall art which consisted of vintage sports photos and eclectic items.  We started off with drinks including Bloody Mary's which were well-made and spicy. Next were the appetizers. We  ordered zucchini fritters, hummus, and 18 oysters. The zucchini fritters were light, airy and not oily. The hummus was good although it's hard to really mess up hummus. The oysters were very fresh, and interesting in that they were very small. The oysters cost $2.45 each.  For the main meal, I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on an onion roll. It had a wonderful coleslaw type of dressing and was joyful to eat. Others in our party ordered jambalaya, steak, chicken stroganoff, and fish and chips. We all tried each other's food and seem to agree that everything was excellent.    Although we were stuffed, we ordered the  chocolate peanut butter dessert. It was nothing like I have ever seen. It's consistency was almost like a thick soup. Extremely decadent, it really hit the spot. Definitely more than enough to share with two or three people.  Service was on point and our particular server was very patient with a party of nine which included four children.

Wow! Where to begin.  I must admit this has been in my bookmarks list for over a year, but after I heard that this was a Top 100 2015 Open Table Restaurant in the ENTIRE United States, I Immediately made reservations for this past Saturday.   I was surprised to see only about 8 tables in total an a very small " bar" seating area.   As expected, service and the food was stellar.  We did the six course price fix of $130 per person not including Sake.  My wife and I were full by the fourth course.  A full review of the approximately 15 items we had are way beyond the scope of this review, but reading other Yelpers reviews gives an accurate description of the type of food to expect.  Additionally, it is my understanding that the menu changes daily depending on the availability of the seafood.  The whole dinner took approximately two hours.  With tip, two bottles of Sake, bottled water, the bill was a bit over $400 dollars.  I will probably return once or twice a year as a destination.

This is quite the deal: two dollars plus tax for two soft cookies and ice cream made into a sandwich.  They have about a dozen differing types of ice cream and cookies.  Limited seating. A great treat if you are on Mill Ave.

I have been dying to try their breakfast taco ( aka burrito) ever since this BBQ joint opened its doors.  There are two ways to order, either go to the front register area and purchase a pre made taco, or go to the main ordering area and customize your taco.  If you are in a rush, definitely go with the pre-made tacos.  They taste fine and are warm.  If you have few minutes to kill, then order your custom taco and walk around, explore the "interesting" Texas/Nascar/gas station decor.  I ordered the brisket with potatoes, cheese, and eggs.  It comes with a flour tortilla.  I found that one did not fill me up so I ordered another.  The piece de resistance, the meat, was tender and moist, just as expected.  It did have a gas type of oder which I was not digging.   Now I need to go back and explore more of my normally suppressed carnivore urges and try the lunch and dinner offerings.

Came here based on fellow Yelpers reviews on a Sunday about an hour prior to the 2pm closing.  The place was packed, and I mean packed. All the tables were taken and the line was six deep.  The staff was extremely joyous and appeared to be enjoying the rush.  A staff member actually saved a table for us when one became available. The menu was easy to navigate and had something for everyone in my family. Previous reviews mentioned that the menu had lots  pork items, so we were prepared for slim pickings since were are a mostly vegetarian non pork eating (mainly personal reasons not religious) family.   However, there were plenty of items that fit the bill. My sons ordered and devoured the FIRST TIME (nutella, banana brulee) and the VANILLA BEAN CUSTARD with marinated strawberries and salted caramel.  My wife and I ordered the 13 MILE (Steadfast farm veggies plus French masala and buckweat crepes) and the BUCKWHEAT piquantee, mushroom ragout with horseradish havarti. The 13 Mile was surprisingly complex with French and South Indian flavors I certainly normally would not have made a crepe out of on my own, and the Buckwheat was savory, and had the right amount of cheese.  They brought out a granola sample that was light and house made with apricot slices ( fantastic) and also the House Brioche sampler which was too hard to eat-  about three times harder than an old crouton.  I am not sure what that was about.  Checking in on Yelp earned us a free coffee or tea.  Its a big bummer they have no decaf coffee or espresso.

Talk about freaky fast! From the time I ordered to having both sandwiches, drinks and chips delivered in hand was approximally 10 minutes. I cannot believe it. This is about as convenient as you can ever wish for. Service was super friendly. Well worth the price for this speedy convenience.  Three stars for the food, five stars for the convenience of quick delivery.

Unfortunately the mechanics at this location are incompetent.  I will keep this brief because they have already wasted enough of my time.  I should say I am very car savvy with multiple cars ranging from older Toyotas to BMW's and Mercedes.     I took one of my cars with specific requests: check the front struts, check the moisture content of the brake fluid, check the condition of the battery.  The service advisor told me they would do a thorough evaluation and inspection.  A few hours later I was called and told everything checked out.  I did not feel confident in the way they spoke to me so I took my car to another mechanic.    Long story short, the strut mounts were torn and the control arm bushing were leaking, the brake fluid needed to be changed as well as the battery.  The second mechanic showed me pictures and the actual numbers of the brake fluid and battery.  Furthermore, the rear brakes needed replacing ASAP.    Beware of this place.

Four stars for the huge selection available TWO months before Halloween.  The seasonal staff is nice but obviously not up to speed because, well, they are seasonal. My two children and wife were able to find their entire Halloween costumes, while unfortunately they didnt have my size of Walking Dead shirts.  I was able to order my size online at the Spirit Halloween online store.

Franco's, located in Old town Scottsdale, is the definition of an old-school Italian restaurant with authentic homemade Italian comfort food matched with very personable individualized service.  Upon entering the somewhat small restaurant, Franco greets everyone with a warm smile.  The first thing you notice on the wall to the left of the entrance is a picture of Franco with Andrea Boccelli. During  Andrea Bochelli's last visit to Phoenix, his entourage  ate at Franco's twice!   When I made the reservations for our party of 10, I describe the restaurant to the rest of our party as reminiscent of an older Italian restaurant from San Francisco's in the 1970s.  Once seated, we immediately got to business, ordered a couple bottles of wine as well as a few mixed drinks. Franco provide bruschetta  on the house. The bread was soft and paired very well with the fragrant tomato and olive oil.  After that we enjoyed an appetizer of meats and cheeses that was delicious fresh and quite authentic. They also brought out an assortment of bread with extra-virgin olive oil for dipping. My main meal of squid ink seafood pasta was delicious. It had an enormous amount of different types of seafood such as shrimp halibut and calamari. Flavors were very fresh, but not bold. I also tried to hand made ravioli which was delicious and apparently made six hours earlier. Dessert was an assortment of four or five different types of cakes, all made in house. There was cheesecake, Tiramisu, chocolate cake, you get the picture. They paired very well with the espresso and cappuccino is that we ordered.   Service is very good and quite quick. If I had to choose any faults, it would be that the alcohol beverages and mixed drinks took a little too long to come to the table. As did the espresso/cappuccino.   Valet parking is available in front and comes in handy and is very convenient. If you are a vegetarian, let them know ahead of time and he will make it a splendid meal for you also.

This is my first Elite review and by far my toughest! The Yelp cliché of really wanting to like this place but (insert standard reasons here) holds true.    Parking was free, which was a huge plus, but there must have been a couple of  thousand cars and no real direction of where the entrance was located.  After waiting in a long line for about 15 minutes, the entrance fee of fifteen bucks was ok considering there was probably fifty plus food vendors inside. Kids under 12 were free- score x 2 for me and my two kids. The various taco stands  only accept tokens that you buy at the entrance. Kind of lame, how are you supposed to guess how many tacos and beverages you want ahead of time??    The venue closed at seven pm, and we arrived about 330pm. There must have been at least 5000 people of all ages looking for tacos. That's a first for me. Surprisingly, literally one hundred percent of the stands we went to had only one or two types of tacos left, everything else was sold out. What the heck! Full price admission should equal fully stocked items. Some if the lines were 15 minutes long, ridiculous for a two dollar taco.    The big downer though, was the inconsistent quality of the tacos.  The vendors were just too busy. Since it was me and my family, we ordered four of each taco- that all looked different. Some were over filled, others were undefiled.   One had sauce, they other didn't.  You get the picture.    What did stand out? Everyone, guests included, was friendly and having a good time. Restrooms were plentiful. Parking free.  Kids free. Bottled water was reasonably priced. An abundance of vendors. Live music. Hence my difficulty with giving it a two star review. Ultimately the lack of consistent taco prep and running out of the majority of tacos is the downfall. The Phoenix food scene has grown a lot since moving here in 1999. The taco festival needs to grow up.

120 degrees. Sunday evening.  Fathers Day.  You guessed it, the a/c at my rental property is making funny noises.  Can the timing possibly get any worse?   I called Dukes around 500 pm and the issue was fixed by 815 pm.  I am happy, the tenant is happy. Win win for everyone.  I was kept abreast of the repairs and received a thorough report from John, who was professional and friendly.    I would highly recommend Arizona Dukes of Air.

This hip japanese noodle / Ramen house is off the beaten path bear Mill Avenue and hard to find.  When you do find it, you will be happy.  You fill out a subway style menu choosing your broth, then add additional toppings such as soft egg, garlic, corn, etc.    They have a decent Sake selection including unfiltered.  Service is actually really attentive. The ambiance is definitely casual and mellow.   If you sit in the center zone, they are often playing old Japanese marital arts  movies.

Started off the evening with a refreshing Cucumber Mule over ice in a copper cup. Next were the Cucumber Hummus Nachos, from which their menu description does no justice. Creativity with this dish earns them much respect in my book. The hummus had, I believe, caramelized onion, balsamic, and chunks of nuts. What an original idea.  Then came the  Apple Brochette on sliced french bread along with feta.  This dish was made to be enjoyed while sipping a glass of wine.  Two more appetizers were quickly consumed including Mediterranean tacos, and feta french fries.    Desert was the "piece de resistance."  S'mores!  Yep, s'mores.  They bring out this mini s'more roaster which I assumed contained Sterno, and graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows along with a fondue stick.  You then proceed to make s'mores on your table. How fun is that!  Service was fun, efficient, and non intrusive.

This review is for Saturday July 5th. We have been reading the reviews and didn't believe them--- Great sushi in this location??? Cant be. Alas, the rolls, sashimi, children's bento box were all very fresh, tasty, not chewy nor fishy smell. Service was excellent, my water was filled three times!  Reasonably priced and not teeny bopperized like Ra Sushi. The ONLY small complaint, no milk for my six year old. I guess  that would taste gross anyway.

DO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE.   We were sweet talked into changing our Century Link phone service to Cox Phone service.   The clueless tech fiddles with our phone for ninety minutes installing a huge phone modem in addition to our basic cable modem, screws up our fax machine, and has our phone number switched off.  When I had enough of his shenanigans and asked him to leave, he and his supervisor I demanded he call refused to have our basic phone service resumed. We are now without any phone service at all, and our business fax does not work.    DO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE.

Never has a name been so true to its mission of Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers.  We stopped by on a warm June night and enjoyed the cool mister covered patio.  TV's galore, a cheerful server and great bar food.  What more can you ask for?

Called to make an appointment, every two minutes someone would pick up and ask one question.  Name, then two minute wait.  Address,  then two minute wait.  Nature of the problem, then two minute wait. After being on hold literally for 7 minutes and thirty seconds I had enough of their unprofessionalism  and hung up.

We came here as a group of 11. Usually large group = poor service.  Not at this place! Francis, the manager had our outdoor table ready upon our arrival, just as promised.  He had the most patient server assigned to our table of three children and eight adults.  Seven appetizers, five beer flights, children's orders, various other drinks, and six entrées later, there was only one small mistake.  Service was attentive, curtious, and appreciated.  Cant wait to go back with just the wife and kids.

As other Yelpers have stated, the best description of this place is a "Subway for Pizza" with some gourmet toppings and a ready to eat pizza in about 10 minutes.  Apparently, my family claims,  I have been here before.  I don't recall.  Either way, the pizza is fun to make, you choose from multiple toppings and then the high school kid behind the counter places it in an open "pizza oven."  All our pizza turned out tasty, with a crunchy crust and fairly well cooked toppings.  The only glitch is my younger son ordered a plain cheese pizza with regular pizza sauce.  It came out burnt and over half the pizza "bubbled up." Essentially inedible for a seven year old with no front teeth.  They offered to remake it and we took them up on their offer.  The old pizza was left on the table and a new one was brought out after about 7 minutes, along with a free pizza coupon.  Nice touch but I prefer the pizza would be made correctly the first time.  Anyway, the cheese would not stay on the cheese pizza, a problem we did not encounter on the other pizzas.

The location is hard to find, but there are a lot of trees that have shade.  When I was inside, the first thing I saw was a bunch of birds in cages.  All the birds have names.  One of the birds have a name called Rush Limbered.  A lot of them are parakeets.  The parakeets have really cool names.

I tried using Treewise from a friend who has used them with good results.    My wife called two time and did not receive a call back.  I called two times and finally Howard called back and was flexible with an appointment for an estimate.  I scheduled appointments for two contractors before him and and another after him since I work 26 days a month, I dont have a lot of time to meet with contractors, tree folks, etc.  He called maybe thirty minutes before the appointment and cancelled. OK no big deal, stuff happened.    I then offered to take pictures of the work I needed and email it to him to save HIM time and get an estimate that way.    I took numerous pics and emailed it to him---No response.   I waited a few days--no response.  I called him--no response.   I texted him--no reponse.    I again called him--no response.   I basically wasted a week of my time waiting to work with Howard.   Not kool.

Why am I ( a male heterosexual) writing a review for this craft store?  Well, how else am I going to decorate my man cave with my famous SF Giants Newspapers?  They did a kick ass job of mounting and framing them. They will also frame jerseys, baseballs, etc.

If you have wool carpets or wool throw rugs, this is your go-to company.  The vast majority of professional carpet cleaners in the valley wont even attempt cleaning wool because of the liability.  I had the nylon carpet in the basement, stairs, children's rooms, hallway, and office cleaned. Additionally, three wool throw carpets were cleaned.  Finally, our wall to wall wool carpet in the master was cleaned.  That was the carpet I am always very concerned about.     Having used Sears at least five times, I knew I would not have to micro manage the team. Chris and Leslie arrived promptly as per the time window, and I did receive a courtesy call 15 minutes ahead.  Their equipment was clean and the various hoses did not leak.   Other carpet cleaners have leaked water on my hardwood floors, a big no-no.  They placed foam pads under the furniture where appropriate and used wall protection. (See photo)   They took their time, did not use shortcuts, and were hustling and sweating the entire time.  All the carpets turned out fabulous.  I highly recommend.

This is my third visit to Second Story, and this time I made sure to not drink any whiskey.  Why, you may ask?  Lets just say I am a slow metabolizer of this certain alcohol beverage and every time I come here, I have a great time.  Was it the whiskey or the service and food that produced such joy,  I would ask myself the next day.   This time I stuck to basic drinks with Tito, and I must say, this place is fabulous.    The food is creative and well done.  The speak easy concept, if not done well, could have been real cheesy, but they hit it on the nail here.  Service is always friendly, if a bit slow.  The drinks, however are the main attraction.  Mixology at its best.    The icing on the cake is the Paul Harvey retro broadcasts playing in the restrooms.  Don't forget to save room for affogato downstairs in the gelato store!

Family owned restaurant with very large and safe parking lot. Inside, very clean, friendly staff, and easy to read chalkboard menu. Menu is very simple yet provides lots of choices. Chips, salsa, and food are brought to the table.  The salsa is the bomb!  Spicy, not to chunky, and compliments the lightly salted chips.

Yelp Review 100!  This place is so under the radar its not even funny.  What a gem hidden away in an unassuming strip mall.    Greeted quickly, WE were asked where WE wanted to sit. Can you believe it? We were then asked how we were doing, and we ordered drinks, including a much too small Thai iced tea.  Waters were brought our without asking (points scored right there) and a carafe of ice water was left on the table (more points again).  My sons water came in a to- go cup with a lid, also much appreciated.   Spice level 4/5 was perfect for me, but I am the type if person who puts Sriracha on everything.   The Tom Kha kicked my butt it was so good.   It was served in white clam shell shaped bowl and is enough to share.  It was packed with fresh semi crunchy veggies and thin flat strips of chicken. The spices were dead on. I have been to other Thai places that make their soup all about the heat.   What surprised me the most was the fried ice cream for dessert.  Enough to share among four people, the outer donut shell was chewy and sweet while the chocolate syrup with perhaps a cherry sauce was a great way to end the evening.  It

People! Are you guys nuts for not giving Uber five stars?? This is the most amazing service I've ever seen in my whole life. You can be anywhere anytime and call for any car and get picked up within minutes. Other than Amazon, I cannot think of any online application that has made my life so easy. If you have a problem with the driver with a low rating, you can easily cancel before your ride even picks you up.

Interesting concept.  It seems like everyone is following the Subway model of ordering.  I have been here a few time, and know they have a solid product.   You write your selection on a pre printed paper, hand it to the counter person, and two minutes later you receive your toppings on a donut no more than 10 minutes old.  The donuts are too fresh to eat by hand.  Gooey, sloppy, soft, full of topping in the most decadent way, a fork and knife are needed.   Four donuts and a cup of coffee cost $12 dollars.   On a final note, upon entering the store, you are immediately met with a sewer order.  This is likely a city issue but still very off putting.  I have been here numerous times and never had this issue before, hence no deduction in yelp stars.

Nothing like a live band singing cover songs in a crowded Irish pub on a Saturday night.  Located in downtown Chandler, Murphys Law is the type of place everyone can enjoy.  There is so much going on inside: rows of empty Whiskey bottles, thousands of dollar bills personalized with a sharpy line the walls, live music, descent food, kool people of all ages, and more.  You can stand, sit, hang out at the bar, or even enjoy the weather in the outdoor patio.

Food is fresh, well seasoned, healthy, consistent a made with pride.  Ordering was easy, cafeteria style and you place a number on you table.  The girl taking the order was friendly, professional, and offered us cups for water.  The wait for the food to be brought to the table was about 10-15 minus but worth it.    The girl who dropped off the food was in much too much of a rush, not friendly nor unfriendly, and made no eye contact. She asked if we needed anything else as she was walking away, not waiting for our answer. We did need something.  My son had a question about his kids meal, and she forget the veggies.    Great food, seriously good, hence the generous 4 stars. Poor execution of service to the table, thereby minus one star.

Boba-- the kool drink currently taking over LA is now growing strong in the Valley of the Sun. For the uninitiated, boba is a 1-2cm tapioca ball that is added to chilled tea beverages.  It is drunk through an unusually large diameter straw with your beverage, then chewed.  Initially for the uninitiated, it is a bit odd.  After downing a few and choosing your favorite flavors, you will soon be dreaming of these.   This place has tons of variety--- to a fault.  Because of this they lose a star, actually, they probably should lose two stars. It is THAT confusing.  The staff, while friendly snd willing, just dont know the menu well enough to assist.  People are literally standing in front of the ten foot tall menu asking each other for help!   As far as the drinks themselves, excellent. Cool.  Tasty. Refreshing. Chewy. Perfect for the Phoenix summer.   I will be back.

Nice local bike store that is actually part of  a larger local bike chain.  I have purchased two bikes from them over the last three years.  They mostly have Giant brand bikes.  Service is very friendly. You can get a decent bike for 300-400 dollars.  They also do tune ups, install accessories, and appear to be very knowledgeable.

Yelp really came through on this restaurant!    We started of with the Hot Rock: essentially mushrooms stuffed with crab and tuna, fried, and topped with eel sauce. They serve four bite size treats that leave you wanting more.   Next was the garlic fried hot peppers followed by an egg that unfortunately I can recall what they called it. For sushi we went with the mango tango roll. They ran out of mango and asked if we would mind avocado. The pieces were not to large, and were surprisingly delicate.  The spicy Ramen with tofu was right on. The noodles had a great texture, and the broth hit the spot. The kids had the chicken katsu bento box.  It was way too much food but well put together. The chicken was not greasy. Boba tea was just ok.  The boba was mushy on the outside and a bit hard in the center.    The ambiance was kool, the music was not too loud, and there was a good mix of people.

I have to admit, I was definitely the biggest naysayer when it came to trying out Topgolf. For some reason, I just assumed it would be like every other mini golf/driving range/ sports bar, and I always declined invitations to attend. How wrong I was! It should be noted,that I am reviewing top golf during a beautiful spring day on a Sunday afternoon. I have no idea how crowded it is in the evenings for the rest of the week.    First off, the place is incredibly well organized, and has plenty of staff to assist in all your needs, albeit most of them are only about 18years old!  After paying a nominal card fee, you are taken to your assigned driving range area complete with private booths, TV, and semi personal waiters.  The food is really good and pretty clever.  We ordered taters, chicken fingers, sliders, pizza, waffles and chicken, Mexican "sushi roll".   Nothing was greasy, everything was high quality, tasty, and served with care.  The presentation of the food was also very creative.   ( see all the pictures)  I definitely will be coming back not only for the driving range but for the food!

Note: This is a vegetarian restaurant.    We were greeted in a nano second and seated in two nano seconds. They had a huge variety of mango, rose, Indian drinks.  They brought one of the drinks out blazingly fast but forgot the other two drinks. When we reminded them about the drinks, they brought my seven year old a drink in a beer glass.  The menu is expansive and had something for everyone.  The utensils and napkins were super cheap and not appropriate for this level of restaurant, but the plates were better.   The food was wonderful.  That being said, I must disclose my wife is Indian, so we do expect a lot.  It did not taste mass produced, the veggies were not soggy, the portions were super huge, the spices were not compromised for non Indians.  They did not scrimp on the fillings either.  Our water was filled no less than 10 times, I kid you not.   Dishes were quickly cleared.  Were were asked half a dozen times if we needed anything  Two appetizers, three main meals, two orders of naan and three drinks were more than enough for four adults, and you will have leftovers.  The cost, $75.00 not including tip.    Overall, with the caveat that Phoenix is not a mecca for fine Indian food, and minor quirks aside, this is easily the best Indian vegetarian food in the Phoenix area with the best, friendliest service.

Little did I know that "affogato" is Italian for drowned.  All this time I thought it meant espresso poured over vanilla gelato or ice cream. How ignorant of me!   What I love about food trucks is they appear in places you would not expect. In this case I discovered their truck at Luke Air Force base of all places.  A welcome surprise that instantly calmed me and cool me down at the same time.  Not only do they serve high-end espresso-based drinks, they also serve Dole whips and vanilla soft serve. The last time I saw a Dole whip was at the Enchanted Tiki Room at Disneyland!  Well worth a visit and the higher price point.

Nice little cafe right outside Nordstrom in the Chandler mall. I bit hectic because of the older mall clients,  but they do a good job with the foam on the specialty drinks.  I prefer soy milk, and Starbucks tends to just make the soy milk warm, not foamy.  There is a nice bar area to hang out and a more private table area in the back. The coffee tasted roasted, not burnt-- a huge plus. They were nice enough to provide the coffee notes on the Debut Espresso brand ( see attached photo).

Perhaps too kool for me, this place actually has really good food.  An eclectic crowd if twenty somethings and 30-40 year old hipsters, we were brought here by our friends who had recently imbibed in the seafood the previous evening.    We started out with a platter of ultra fresh Washington state oyster that were served with a spread of horseradish, and various other sauces.  Next were the dollar each, once again, ultra fresh jumbo shrimp that were peel and eat.  Some in out party were not digging the peel part.   Next, the Brussel sprouts were, for me, the highlight of the night.  Not bitter as sprouts sometimes can be, they were prepared crisp and crunchy.  I wanted more.    The calamari was just ok and I would not order it again, as was the salmon, which was over cooked.  Finally, the lobster cakes were great, with just the right amount of bread crumbs and good sized lobster chunks.   I would definitely come here again.

The first thing you notice at NEW India Gate is not only the new location, but everything is literally new.  New plates, utensils, chairs, tables, menus.  You name it and it is new. Two knowledgable and loquacious brothers run the place.  They seat, take orders, bus tables, serve the food and answer every question about the eclectic menu that is thrown at them. The recipes, however, are the fathers.   We decided to sample menu items other than the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala. We started of with the beef samosas. I had never seen the beef variety before.  All I can say is "WOW!"  Served with mint and tamarin chutney, the     delicately spiced ground beef was seasoned perfectly.  I would have  been satisfied to end the meal right then and there.     Next was the Fish Pakora, they were tasty and made with moist white fish.  Nothing mind blowing.  For the main meals we ordered "Indian Hot" spice level.   We ordered: Mushroom Matter (mushroom, tomato, green peas and spices),  Chana Masala (garbanzo beans and masala sauce), and Karahi Shrimp (ginger, tomoto, onion, bell pepper served in an Indian copper pan). I was craving super hot but I would equate it to a medium at a Thai restaurant.  The food paired really well with the fresh soft garlic naan.  I am definitely returning and bringing friends!
