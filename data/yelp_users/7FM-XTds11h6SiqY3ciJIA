This place is awesome. The salon is small and there aren't many people working there so it's best to set an appointment. But everyone was very friendly, professional, and experienced.   I went in for a refill and went here because the acrylic fills are only $15. The guy that did my nails did exactly what I asked him to do, made my nails super even and clean looking and was very quick about it!   I will definitely be back and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good, cheap, clean nail salon!

The sushi here is pretty good, especially for Arizona and I love their happy hour! I have been here several times and the service changes depending on the server, some servers are very outgoing and attentive, but a few seem a bit careless and it can definitely affect your eating experience.   Overall, I would suggest going to dinner here, especially during the happy hour.

First off, this place is awesome, clean, and the staff are super friendly. Not only was it affordable, I love how my nails turned out.   Since moving here a few months ago I have been trying to find a new nail salon to go to and I think I found it here at Snow Nails!

I don't usually go to this Fry's, but I was running late one morning and stopped in here to get a quick breakfast and coffee from the little Starbucks kiosk by the deli. This Starbucks was better then some of the main stores I have been to. It was very clean and the girl working there was very friendly and made my drink perfectly!

I'm surprised this place has such high reviews. The people that work here are fairly friendly and the salon is pretty clean, but the services was some of the worst I have experienced in a while and I get my nails done a lot.   I went in to get my nails refilled and repainted. Not only did it take way too long just to get a fill, over an hour, but they turned out crooked, and uneven, I have a few cuts on my fingers and the guy doing my nails charged me more than what they said it would me.  I think the overcharge came from me asking him to file my nails down and when he barely shortened them I asked for shorter so he had to refile a few after trying to convince me to just keep them long.   Overall, I appreciated how nice those working were but I felt like they were more concerned with getting money than giving good service.

I was really surprised at how amazing the food was, being a chocolate restaurant I was expecting that just the desserts would be good, but everything we ordered was amazing! The wait time was a little long but totally worth it, plus it gave us plenty of time to enjoy our shakes. :)

My younger sister, boyfriend and I recently did a shoot with John for Prom and it was perfect! He engaged with all three of us throughout the shoot and made sure we were each enjoying ourselves, despite the time crunch and heat. He provided waters, encouraged us to take funny/goofy pictures and made sure we all had the shots we wanted. The best part was how dedicated he seemed to get good shots, at one point he even laid on the ground to make sure he got the perfect angle for a jumping picture we all wanted to do.  On top of the shoot being a blast, the photos turned out great! The spots John chose as backgrounds really helped to make the the three of us stand out while also complementing our outfits. We received our photos back very quickly in both raw and JPEG form, which was great!   I would definitely recommend John for any type of shoot, especially with individual or small group subjects, and I suggest people go after him now before he realizes he could be charging a lot more for his services!

Best donut place ever!!!! They are amazing. Donuts and toppings always taste fresh and wonderful! The coffee is super good and the staff is incredibly friendly. I love all kinds of donuts but this place puts every other donut place to shame, including Krispy Kreme!
