Excellent food, great patio and friendly staff.  Couldn't ask for a better lunch spot and you definitely get your money's worth and more!

While most of the food I have had there is quite good, after my experience today, I will never order food from there again.  I called in my order for pick-up, as I only have a short period of time in which to pick up and eat my lunch.  The person who took my order stated it would be ready in 15 minutes.  When I arrived there around 15-20 minutes later there were approximately 6 people ahead of me in line, so I had to wait about another 10 minutes until I could advise of my pick up order.  When I got to the register and they looked for my order, it was still in queue to be prepared!  It took them over 30 minutes to get my order completed.  I feel this is an outrageous amount of time and not one person apologized for taking so long to get my order ready.  I have had to wait in the past, but this time it was absolutely ridiculous!  The whole point of calling ahead is to save from having to wait for the order.  I understand when a place is busy, but having to wait that long for an order is not acceptable.

I love Singh Farms! I wish I could make it out there every weekend to enjoy all of their delicious juices, pizza and other goodies. The produce is so good and I love that they are an organic farm. Can't say enough good things about them.

Excellent food and service. The pablano salsa was amazing! I highly recommend the lemon cilantro rice and black beans for your sides.
