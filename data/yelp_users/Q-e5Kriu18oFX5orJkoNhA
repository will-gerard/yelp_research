Rostias Place is the best Mexican food place in Phoenix.  They have amazing machaca and the salsa's are always great.  Sometime's the salsa's and chile are so hot I fear my stomach might explode, but in a good way. It doesn't get any better than Rosita's.

I had the pleasure of (finally) eating at Welcome Diner today and it was amazing! I can't wait to go back.   I had the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and a side of fried avocado, both of which were great. Fried chicken was juicy and biscuit was flaky and tasted fresh. The fried avocado was awesome and like nothing I have had before.   My friend got a collard green sandwich with a fried egg on top. She smashed it and then raved about how great it was. Each sandwich came with a side of fruit which was the perfect side for the heavy sandwiches.   Like I said before I can't wait to go back!! Highly recommend, this is a local gem that I would love to see thrive.

After purchasing a daily deal here I did a month of yoga going about 4 or 5 times a week.  The instructors are great and I felt amazing after every class. The downside is that the studio seems a little dirty and always had a stinky foot odor in the studio due to the carpet and sweat combo that goes on. Yikes. Also, I am not sure Bikram is for me because of the strictness of the practice. I desperately missed my down dogs. So as this studio is not for me it is worth a try if you are interested in hot yoga.

Mediocre to the max with bad service to boot!   I've given this place a handful of tries and I just can't seem to find anything I like. The service is probably the worst part. Waiting 10 minutes for sushi rolls that are clearly ready and waiting to be served is not acceptable. I feel bad for the waitresses - every time I am in they seem to be running around like crazy.    The food is pretty horrible too. I CAN say the Asian chicken salad is pretty good but the rice bowls and sushi are all not good.

I have been here a ton of times and the sandwiches are always great. The have a lovely little market as well and the patio is the best. On Sunday afternoons they have live music on the patio.

Last time I visited Duck & Decanter I was very disappointed. I have been visiting this place since high school and it has always been great but for some reason this time everything was off. My sandwich bread was hard and inedible, the topping were sparse, and the pasta salad was just not good.

There is nothing better than a lazy Sunday at Postino. Actually, there is nothing better than a lazy any day at Postino. The food is great, the wine is great and the service is (usually) great. Along with the bruschetta, which is yum, I always order the Italian Picnic salad. The beets and bacon are delish paired with a creamy, Italian dressing. The only downside is the parking. Very limited and usually you have to valet. If you are in the neighborhood I recommend walking or biking. All in all this place will not disappoint.

The good: Pizza Soup Salads Wings  Not so good: Pasta  I never get the pasta here because from my experience it just isn't great and if I am going to eat pasta I want it to be great.  Other than that it is really good.  The service has always been good.  I would recommend it.

I had the most horrible shopping experience here today.  I went to go get a new pair of jeans and when I walked in the sales associate came up to me and asked if he could help.  He then proceeded to argue with me about what size I am.  He finally let me try on a size that is one size smaller than I wear.  I tried them on while the whole time he stood outside of the dressing room telling me about how everyone calls him "the jean guy" and that i should tell all my friends to come get their jeans from him.  After I tried on the jeans that were so tight I could barely breath he then told me that I could NOT try on a size larger. I was so livid I threw the jeans down and walked out. I will never go back and I will not be telling my friends about "the jean guy."

I LOVE Dragon Palace. I have been going here for about 16 years.  It is your average looking neighborhood, family owned chinese restaurant. They have crazy lanterns and blue walls inside.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  They will make recomendations and help you out with ordering.  Lunch is awesome...you can order from a list of about 15 dishes and it comes with rice, wantons, and an eggroll all for about 9 bucks.  Dinner is great too...portions are large and perfect for sharing.  I would definetly recommend this place.

I thought this place was alright. If someone wanted to check it out I would go back but I wouldn't recommend it when picking a place to eat.  The menu is kind of small and there is really only sushi which is fine but if you have a non-sushi eating person in the group this place would not work.   We went here on a sunday afternoon at noonish and stayed for quite awhile....no one else came in while we were there.  This sort of freaked me out.  Anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine. Nothing amazing but not bad at all.  The one thing I did not like was the spicy tuna roll was pretty big.  I can't stand that. Anyway, its ok. Check it out and decide for yourself.

Psycho Jock has done all the embroidery and silk screening for our retail items.  The quality of the clothes they can get are great.  Lily will also give you her opinion on all the merchandise and she is super knowledgeable about all of the items they can order.  I would definitely recommend them.

If you are in the mood for a good hot dog then Ted's is a great choice.  It is cheap and friendly.  They also have a  great chicken sandwich and the french fries and onion rings are home made and to die for. So good. The only downside to this place is that ordering  can be a bit messy.  The cook hollars at you while you are still far back in the line and you have to yell your order at him and sometimes its crowded and hard to find a place to sit.  If you don't go at lunch rush though, its great.

I have been eating here since I was in the womb. It is my favorite mexican food in AZ.  Nothing is very hot but everything is super tasty.  I love the cheese crisp...very crispy and the green chili burro.  They put a little bit of cheese inside the green chili burro...mmmm.  Also the salsa is sooo good. I have never had a bad meal here.

I have been eating at Tokyo Express since I was teeny tiny.  My fam used to go a few times a week.  It's still the same and still as good.  I have tried alot of the items on the menu.  I like the regular terriyaki, the tokyo chicken, the sukiyaki, and the bentos.  The bento boxes are a ton of food for only about 7 or 8 bucks. I would definitely recommend this place for to-go japanese or a quick rice bowl lunch.

I really enjoy coming to this place.  The patio is really cozy and I would recommend sitting out there.  I have only had the late night menu but I always enjoy my food and the margs are good too.  Try the green chili quesadilla...so delish.  P.S. The patio can be slippery because of the waterfall. I face planted it the other night and my boyfriend is STILL laughing. Be careful!

Frank and Lupes is one of my favorite places to grab up some good mexican food. Mind you, it is NEW MEXICAN not Sonoran. Anyway, they have a good happy hour (only available on the patio, which is lovely) and everything I have tried on the menu is great. I would recommend anything with their shredded beef...i just drooled on my keyboard. Eew. Also, some of my favoite salsa.

I've been to Ra a few times and the sushi is alright.  I usually go for the happy hour drinks because the specials are good. The last time I went though the service was HORRIBLE.  My cousin and I sat down and the server came up and asked for our drinks and food and when we told her we were not eating she told us the we were NOT ALLOWED to sit in the dining room so we ordered edemame.  She also kept coming up and asking if or other guests were coming or not because she wanted to take the menus. It was very wierd. Also the two times I have been there the place has smelled like mildew. I dont think I will go back.

The outdoor patio is what makes this bar great.  If you can find a spot on the patio, which can be hard because it gets busy, you are set.  I love the vibes of this bar.  It has a very laid back environment and it is not intimidating or lame at all. I have only experienced the food once and it was simple bar food but it was much better then the average bar.

Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Deseo. The food was outstanding and the mojitos, which I am usually not a fan of, are amazing and compliment the food so well. I have only been once but hopefully I will get to experience Deseo again. Four stars only because our waiter forgot our sides with our entrees and the decorum is a little ho-hum.

My grandmother worked here like a hundred years ago before it moved to the current location on 35th Ave. So...I have been eating here since the beginning of time, which was, of course, the day i was born.  The food is always good.  I love love the salsa.  The hot sauce is not my favorite but whatev.  If you do not speak spanish you might also have trouble with the staff and sometimes they are not the friendliest but thats ok with me becuase the food is always good. : )

I like Jason's Deli. I'm not real picky but I just don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews.  I love their salad bar because it is simple yet always super fresh with a good amount of dressing options.  Their sandwichs have always impressed me and the soups are great and made fresh everyday.  They are a no trans fat place and most of their stuff is organic.  I think its great but maybe I just suck. Who knows.

Oh.My.God. Have I died and gone to grocery store heaven? I think so. Fancy Fry's, as I have renamed it, is 20 min from my house. I refuse to go to the Fry's near my house and now drive out of the way to go here. Wine bar, valet parking, samples all over the store. SAMPLES ALL OVER THE STORE! I want to run outside and yell it at everyone that walks by. And the dessert bar, Lord! If you hate grocery shopping like me, Fancy Fry's will make it a much more enjoyable experience.

I eat at Hana's probably two or three times a week.  I absolutely love their chicken meal.  Its grilled chicken, rice, pita, and a small salad for about 9 dollars.  I also love their grilled chicken sandwhich.  It's more of a philly sandwhich type thing but sooo good. You will not be dissapointed.  P.S. I just scarfed the Hana's Mixed Greens salad.  Even though there wasn't really a mixture of greens really,  it was soooo good. Almonds, parmasean, marinated kabob chicken, onion, tomato, cucumber, and lots of cabbage. Yum.

The food has really gone downhill.  I used to go here all the time when I lived on that side of town but the last few times I've gone the sushi was horrible.  Maybe it was an off day? I might venture back to see if this was the case.

I have mixed feelings about this place.  One of the most important things for me in Mexican food is salsa and hot sauce.  I do enjoy their versions here. The rest of the food is not great though.  The only thing I will eat here is a taco, they are pretty good and if you do decide to venture in I would recommend them.  Everything else I've had is blah. Not bad but not good either.  My mom and I come here everyonce in a while when we are in the area and want tacos. So that's that.

I don't know why but I had really low expectations for this place the first time I ate here. I have been three times now and every time I am surprised by how great it is. They have awesome Al Pastor which you can get in a burrito, taco, tostada or quesadilla. You can actually see the meat roasting in the kitchen with a pineapple on top. Great salsas and friendly staff too.

The deliciousness of their hot & sour soup will forever haunt my dreams. (Dramatic much?) Seriously, the food is really great. Edamame in truffle butter is a great start to the meal and just like Chu's Fate, the flat rice noodles are amazing. Wish I could give 3 1/2 stars because our server was a little weird and standoffish and the bathrooms were way gross but I will round up to a 4 because the food is that good.

Posh is one of the coolest restaurants I have experienced.  The menu consists of all the protein they have available that day and you get to mark off what you do not like.  The number of courses depends on how much you would like to spend.  This place is so fun because you really have no idea what you are going to get.  I had the most amazing scallop app and short rib entree. I would highly recommend this place.

This place is great. I recently took one of my dogs here for a teeth cleaning. The doctor here uses a technique where they do not have to put the dog under anesthesia. They wrap them in a blanket and then lay them in their lap and make them as comfortable as possible. My dog didn't mind at all and after this treatment my dogs teeth look amazing! Sparkly clean.   Also, I checked out the boarding and grooming areas and the dogs looked like they were having a blast. Playing with each other and staff, sleeping, rolling around, etc. If I had to board my dogs this would be my first choice place.

I heart Fresh and Easy! Which by the way I like to call Fresh and Sleazy...simply beacuse it rhymes and makes me giggle.  This place is great if you are buying food for just yourself or you and one other.  They package their stuff in small amounts like sandwich meat, cheese, nuts, etc.  Also, some of their premade foods like the veggie eggrolls are sooo good.  P.S. If you go around 9pm they discount alot of the items.  I can get out of there with all my groceries and spend 30 some bucks.

Working at a dance studio I can almost get away with just wearing Lululemon everyday, all day. Their clothing is the highest quality. I've worn my Wunder Unders at least twice a week for 3 years now and they still look great. If you can afford it do it and if you can't afford it do it anyway, like me!

This week we hosted our Annual Sales Meeting at the Hampton Inn on Highland. First off, the staff was amazing. They were the highlight of our stay. From the front desk staff to the event managers, they were always friendly and on top of all of our needs. The space they were able to provide us was great even though we made changes at the last minute to the head count they did everything possible to make our conference room comfortable. The continental breakfast was great - including waffles, bagels, breakfast meats, coffee, and healthy options too. This helped us to cut down on costs for providing breakfast for all our out of town guests. All in all, I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn for a work conference or a family stay. They have great amenities like a heated pool and the staff is incredible.

I was new to the bikini wax scene when I started going to European Wax Center about six months ago and I was extremely nervous my first visit. My technician, Paige, made me feel so comfortable and has been a complete professional every time since. I have the best experience every time I go in and would never hesitate to recommend this place to a friend. The only downside is i wish the front desk girls didn't try to upwell so hard every singe time but i understand that is part of their job.

This place is ridiculous. No complaints here. THE most interesting salsa bar I have ever seen with tradition styles such as chipotle and tomatillo alongside crazy inventions like sesame and peanut. All delicious. So far I've had the shark fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and carne asada burro. My fav is the shrimp tacos but all were amazing. Also, get a side of the calavasas - yum.

Unfortunately, I had a sad, sad experience at Richardson's a few weeks back. I was tasked with planning a dinner for about 50 of my colleagues who would be traveling to AZ from various parts of the country. Because we have been having the most incredible weather and because Richardson's is known for authentic New Mexican cuisine (which I thought many would not have experienced before) I decided on this restaurant's patio for our setting.   Working with the events manager was great, she was very responsive and easy to work with, I had great expectations! Sadly, it all went to sh*t on the night of the dinner. First of all, they had two servers on a 50+ person party. Whaaa? I felt bad for the servers as they were completely set up to fail. Second, when one of my colleagues asked if some of our tables could get water, after waiting 45 minutes, the manager got in her face. Inappropriate!   The manager later apologized and our colleagues who had not yet been greeted or helped were quickly taken care of. I appreciate them stepping up but these thing should have never happened in the first place. As great as the food was, and that is the only reason for my two stars, I will not be heading back to Richardson's anytime soon.

I would like to start this review by saying that I have been coming to Ken's Nails and Spa for a few years now for several different services and - in the past - have always had great service and results. I have always been greeted immediately and have never had to wait more than a couple minutes before I am taken back for services. It truly has been my go-to in the past and I am super sad that I am going to stop frequenting this business.   I am not exactly sure what has changed but my last few visits have been anything but pleasant. First, a couple weeks ago I came in for my normal eyebrow wax. Usually I am in and out in a couple minutes with perfectly manicured brows. This time I left with my eyebrows on FIRE. I went to the Albertson's following my appointment and bought some cooling aloe gel for relief but nothing helped. The area ended up breaking out in blisters that lasted at least a week. I had several people ask me if I had suffered a burn. Yikes! it was not good and extremely painful.   I let the bad eyebrow wax slide and thought maybe it was a fluke accident and went back last night for a mani-pedi. I feel bad because I am not sure the tech who was working on me really understood some of the things I was trying to communicate to her. At one point I asked her to file my nails slightly shorter and she said "ok" but then just moved on. That wasn't really the worst part though. During both the mani and pedi she repeatedly hurt me while removing my cuticles. I can be a wuss so I know sometimes it is just me being a baby but this was ridiculous. At one point I gasped and pulled my foot away and the nail tech next to her actually had to scold her and tell her to take it easy. Needless to say I left with one nail bleeding which didn't stop for over an hour and is still painful to the touch.

I have been to two shows so far and can't wait to go back! The service is fast and friendly and the lay out of the club is great, not a bad seat in the house. My only qualm would be that the seating can be a little cramped BUT, like another yelper noted, sitting close to other groups does make for good energy!Like them on FB. They post trivia and then give away tickets to shows for answering correctly. I wish this place the best and will definitely be returning!

I've loved the downtown location for years so when the new location opened I was excited to try it. I have been to the new location a handful of times now and its amazing every time. I have had several pasta dishes, pizzas, salads, antipasto platter, and desserts, all of which were outstanding.   Out of the 5 or so times I've been I've had one bad service experience and I don't blame he server, he was very overwhelmed after the restaurant received a random rush on a week night. Other than that it really seems like they are getting a hold on this place. I know it was a little off at first but it is definitely on point now.   If you have never tried the downtown location or are already a Bianco lover you have to try this location. I've never waited more than a half an hour for a table and the food is just...sigh...the best.

Yum! I have been here a few times now and I have not been disappointed. The specialty coffees are great. I had a latte and it came out piping hot. I've had an omelet and the eggs Benedict and both were very good. Last time I was here I saw someone with an awesome looking Bloody Mary that had strips of bacon garnish which I will definitely try next time.

I've had two great experiences at Brat Haus. The first was a lunch with some coworkers to scope out the place for a corporate event. We had a great lunch and our server was very knowledgeable about the beer selection and what kinds of beers would pair well with what brats. She also recommended the pretzel with cheese which was amazing. Who doesn't love a good soft pretzel?  Gluten haters, for shame!!  My second experience there was for our corporate event. We reserved the patio which is such a great area. They have giant jenga, ping pong, and darts, as well as large overhead heaters and big benches which were very conducive to our guests mingling and moving and having a great time. Kevin, the manager, was awesome and on top of everything. He made sure our party was well staffed with servers, busers, and food runners. He also made sure that the appetizers came out in waves so as our guests were showing up there were always enough munchies. Once everyone arrived our servers started taking orders from our set menu and as people decided they were ready to eat the servers were always prepared to take their dinner order. Once again dinner came out in waves and it was perfect. Everyone mingled, ate, and drank at their leisure. I could not have picked a more perfect and well prepared place for our event. I will definitely be going back there and recommend we do more events at the Brat Haus.

Jennifer, of Jehnuine Designs, does great work and is very professional. About a year ago she created a logo for my business.

Slanted Rice is ridiculously good! I have been going here weekly for about 3 months now and can't get enough. Everyone I have introduced loves the place too! Some of my favorite dishes are the spring rolls, curry, charbroiled chicken plate, and the garlic noodles. Everything is fresh and the staff is always friendly. Love!

Eastwind is great!  If you are looking for good, fast, and cheap lunch or dinner this is the place to go. They have awesome lunch and happy hour specials.  They have a large menu that includes sushi. I like how you just walk up and order and they bring your food to you.  Also the lunch waitstaff is suuuuper friendly and nice.
