Okay here we go, this bar is very special to me. This is a small dive located in a strip mall that i never noticed til 2008 even though i lived 2 blocks away most of my life. Final round became like Cheers to me for awhile, always familiar faces and friendly people(sometimes too friendly ;). The food here is really great (homemade pizza dough and yummy burgers) and the drinks are perfect and super cheap($5 stoli redbull,what?). There is usually stuff going on like karaoke on saturdays, poker and 35 cent wings on mondays, and they have special events occasionally. Went there last year for St Patty's day and there was cheap homemade corned beef and cabbage with a live band and they extended into the parking lot for it. This bar is smallll and not the nicest decor(star off for lack of room and decor), but its comfy and all too easy to become a reg.  Bring a couple friends to have a nice divey time and sing/listen to some bad karaoke. I have probably never had more fun at a bar as I have at this one.

Sick is the only word to describe. This place made me want to call a health inspector right away. The place smelled strongly of cleaning fluid when I entered, but the place was filthy....how does that happen? My daughter has been begging to go here, but I don't remember it being so bad. There was food all over the floor, spill signs everywhere, trash, dirty tables, etc. I ate some chicken that was goodish, I had some more and spit it out cuz it was pinkish inside. I was scared of the shrimp. The salad bar was horrendous. Yellow-brown iceberg with warmish veggies and dressings. ..yum sounds so good. coagulated mac and cheese and burned pizza. The stuff looks like its been sitting there since 1991. Dirty plates, silverware, walls, floors, everything! Nobody bussed our table, 6 dirty plates and not one of them moved. Coke was out, ice ran out, cups ran out. I have never felt so dirty after going to a restaurant, I need a shower. I can see, however, by the clientele that this is up to some peoples' standards. A guy walked next to me, dropped his straw, left it, said oh well and got a new one. I think the bum sitting next to me was the cleanest one, since he licked his plate and stacked them neatly. The food here is just gross, all fried, canned, and bagged and probably unsafe. I would rather go to Golden Corral or Sweet tomatoes. Never again, Hometown. Never.

Man, this place is not a good venue for the over 21 crowd to enjoy a concert. This place has absolutely nothing special about it at all, except some good bands occasionally and a decent patio. My first experience here is when I turned 21 and saw Phunk Junkeez and others, oh wait I didnt get to see them because I got kicked out! Security here sucks, they are big dumb a-holes. I was kicked out shortly after turning 21 for supposedly giving drinks to minors and being drunk. The supposed minors were not even with me and my friends got kicked out also for drinking, which they weren't. I admit I was a lil tipsy, but the bouncers were jerkoffs and didnt believe I was 21 even though they were staring at my id. Oh well that was awhile ago and I have went back reluctantly since then. I saw atmosphere last May, we had to park a mile away over the bridge(lame) and wait in a longass line to get in. Take my shoes off??what? Am I a terrorist now? Give me a break. Anyhow, the bar's drinks are AWFUL and way expensive for the quantity and quality. The show was good though, sound isn't too bad. Why can't they have a few tables and a little decor in the main stage area? I feel like it's a concert in the street. I guess it's so they can pack as many people in, so classiness is not in the agenda. This place is more suited for the under 21 crowd, I guess I just like a lil comfort while enjoying music now, not the moshing type anymore, I'm old, haha.

I am happy to be the first one reviewing my gynecologist (hehe). First of all let me say that they moved the office to Price and Baseline, so the address here is wrong. Ok that said, Dr. Eich is awesome. He is very professional and very knowledgeable. He has been my gyno for 10 years and delivered my 2 children. Every woman knows that lying spread eagle in stirrups while having a man examine you "down there" is pretty unnerving, but Dr. Eich makes you feel comfortable with not a hint of creepiness (which I have felt from other gynos :( ) I also read an interesting article that Dr. Eich has the most patients in Tempe, but that doesn't stop the office from being quick, reliable, and giving great service. My mom, stepmom, and I all go there and we are very happy, so when you need your yearly "tune-up", check this place out.  :)

Screw all grocery stores except Trader Joe's.  This is la creme de la crop, I am telling you. I have this strange addiction to the place that keeps me coming back time and again. Could it be the amazing prices? yes. Could it be the awesome foods? double yes. Could it be the sweet wine selection? word.  I usually hit up the nice floral section on my way in, those mini daffodils are so perty. I then go to the produce section, where I find the most awesomest heirloom tomato selection, my favorite mini potatoes, nice bag o brussels, cheap organic avocados. Oh today they had a make your own guacamole kit with 2 avos, a tomato, a shallot, a lime and a jalapeno, flippin sweet! I like to get the fantastic hummuses and tzatziki/raita, oh and their spinach dip is pretty amazing. The cheese plethora could bring me to tears, its such a weakness. I am currently enjoying the apple smoked garlic cheddar, yum. I then whip to the sample counter. They always have a great drink like their lemonade or iced tea or juice and, of course, their bomb coffee. The serve a special lil sample that is actually delicious, unlike the microwaved up breaded crap at most places. I had a mini tostada with all the fixin, soo num. I then go down the frozen food aisle. Some damn good frozen fish down there, salmons, mahi mahi, red snapper, cod, halibut, swordfish, whatev. They also have some really special frozen dinners, like the orange chicken could rival Panda Express and some pimp pizzas too. To wrap this up, I like to get a lil winetasting in and then pick up some super cheap, super great wine (beers too).  This place knows what's up. Whenever I get my fearless flyer in the mail, I get so excited, I am flying over there in a heartbeat. I am never disappointed in their food (salted dark chocolate caramels are dreamy) or service( the nicest hippies you ever did meet).

Whenever I walk into Changing Hands, I get this happy little butterfly feeling I can't explain. I am definitely a kid in a candy shop....No more like Charlie in Wonka's Chocolate factory. This is the most delightful bookstore in Phoenix in my opinion. They have a nice selection of new and used books and lots of fun unique etc. items for purchase. I have found some semi rare stuff here. The staff is soo frickin friendly, it's ridiculous. I just feel at home when I am here and never want to leave.

This is a sweet lil spot right in the middle of First Friday central. I actually never knew it was a bar until pointed out to me because it looks like all of the other cute artsy houses on the block. Ok so as for bottled beer they have a wonderful selection, a lot of beers I have never seen anywhere else. I got a Gonzo beer in memory of my man, Hunter S. Thompson, and I smuggled the bottle out. This place has a very chill vibe and during the crazy late hours they have amazing djs that actually play good music, not that trendy crap at most bars. I love the blue light they got going on, so chill, I feel like I'm at a jazz lounge. I had to give a star off because one time I went the bartender took an ungodly amount of time getting my bill and for some crazy reason you can't put your drinks down on the table outside on the patio. Weird maybe? They told me it was because they had no liquor license for outside, mmmkay. So were all tipsy and every 5 min some dude walks by and says pick your drinks up....haha were just holding our drinks up, forget, put em down, get yelled at again, how is that legal? Ah well, I still like the place and since I don't smoke anymore, I don't care anymore. Check this place out (I think it's only beer and wine, I could be wrong though) its a great lil spot.

In-N-Out is a truly spiritual experience with a burger. When I bite into my Dub-Dub Animal Style I seem to transcend to a higher level of thinking and realization, but then 10 min. after I'm done, I simply go into a foodcoma and pass out. There are virtually no flaws in the In-N-Out world. I do admit that this place gets overly busy during primetime, but that's just foreplay, baby! You get the delicious aroma that makes the hairs on your neck stand up and tingles your whole body. You get to the window and see the staff members making the food, its like a porno! I'm telling you!  The staff is always soooo nice and they will do whatever you want...and I mean whatever...When you get this burger, it's all over, complete foodgasm. This place is so great for a late night binge, I am actually going as soon as SNL is over....can't wait, so excited!!

Oh bejesus, I have some stories from this place! This place is strange, crazy, oh so many things...I confess I have never eaten here except beer cheese which I think was good(too drunk to remember). Most of the time I get drunken blitzed crazy here, dance my a$$ off, and leave my credit card at the bar...This place has changed pretty dramatically since when I first started going. They used to have some good live funk cover band on Saturdays, then they switched to a not so good funk cover band, and now its some crazy techno raver freaky shi...Hmm I just don't think I like it as much anymore, I can't get down like that til 4 am anymore. The bartenders I used to love are gone and now there is Scottsdale snob boob job chick, dumb-as-rocks frat bro, and weird ambiguous raver boytoy behind the bar. Last time, Raver boytoy had jeans torn all the way up his a$$ and then changed after an hour to black patent booty shorts, freAKY-DI bondage shirt, and heavy black eyeliner. To say the least I was beside myself with laughter, but I knew I had to get out of there, everyone started morphing into Fear and Loathing-type creatures.....Ok but here's the rundown: great German beers served up in awesomely large glasses if you prefer and decent alcohol selection, large dance floor, good music occasionally, really great owner and wife team....PS if you take someone special back in the pitch-black mysterious tables of the restaurant area, there is this red exit light shining like a beacon, pull the curtains around your table, lay back into each other, savor this moment of absolute zen and completely let go....you just might just discover who you really are...

I usually love this place. Really good breakfast burritos and tacos. However today I found a short curly black hair nestled in my machaca burrito and had to throw it away immediately and now I feel ill. This really sucks since I liked this place a lot and its the closest burrito place but now I cannot eat there anymore. I did see someone not wearing a hairnet in the kitchen, please up your health standards.

I just went to this place on a whim today when an intense craving for Thai hit me. First place I saw on my drive home so I really had no expectations. The place was nicely decorated and even though it was supposedly closed per the sign in the window, the doors were flung open and the couple inside warmly invited me in. I was very pleasantly surprised by my extra spicy panaang curry shrimp. The dish was full of shrimp and yellow, red, and green peppers swimming in the tastiest curry sauce I have ever had. Very spicy, but soo much flavor. The fried rice I ordered on the side was by far the best I have tasted from any take out place in the valley. A delicious egg roll was also thrown in on the side. The sweet lady that worked there gave me a free can of coconut juice to wash down the spicy concoction and I must say it was a very kind gesture.  Needless to say,I joined this website just to write a review of Palee's, that's how much I loved this place and will go back to sit down and eat next time

okay I went back on Friday and ohhhh yum! sooo good again. I got the same spicy panang shrimp yet not as spicy as last time. I got the Tom kha soup.....oh my it was sooo delicious. lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves with chicken  cilantro coconut milk, etc,etc.  The BEST soup I have ever had in my life! I also just read that tom yum(which is tom kha, sans the coconut milk) has supposed healing benefits with a cold and maybe cancer. Oh I sat down this time, the waiter was very sweet and worked very hard since he was the only one. My boyfriend also got something really good, I cant remember since I was too focused on my own.  I also had a thai iced tea w/ cream and it was the best thing to ever drink with thai food. Well I had to write again since I am eating my leftovers and it is too good for words. Oh and just so everyone knows, since the reviewer below mentioned bamboo, no its lemongrass, dont eat the lemongrass and lime leaves....its for the flavor and aroma but too tough to eat with the soup. probably could choke ya. ok well i am already craving it, be back soon

This place is really great, the food and the employees. I have come here a few times, I always get the Philly Original wit wiz and onion. I put some sweet peppers on it and sometimes sprinkle some malt vinegar over it. Th fries are yummy with the fry sauce. I like their iced tea and I like that they make a chilled espresso drink that you can pour yourself for the same price as a soda. The employees are really friendly, they say hi the minute you walk in, converse with you, and even offer advice. The guy behind the counter gave me and my kids free cookies, which were awesome by the way! This place seems pretty true to Pat's Steaks in Philadelphia with the chopped meat and cheese whiz, I am guessing it would taste similar.

Here is the first awful restaurant that compelled me to write a review, its from another website before I found this one. It's back from Nov. 2008 so who knows if things have changed, but me thinks not as to what I have heard..This restaurant was the worst I have been to for the price::   I usually never write reviews of restaurants unless I am moved to do so. My experience here was not pleasant and mistake after mistake compelled me. First off, I am a chef at a respectable restaurant in Tempe. I have also waited tables before at many restaurants. Our server completely forgot my drink order, I ignored that and just decided to forget about it. My cousin got an appetizer of mushrooms and other sauteed veggies that was pretty bland. What completely upset me is that our server brought out our sushi, teriyaki chicken and salads at the same time! So while I'm trying to enjoy my sushi my entree is getting cold and my salad was warm because it is plated next to the chicken. The albacore I got seemed to be seared on the edges, which isn't mentioned on menu, but it was very dry, not stored correctly. My philly roll was disgusting, I had to send it back The first time I had ever sent anything back. It just tasted not fresh and premade. My server didnt seem to care, not even a sorry, but a "that's weird our fish is fresh everyday", well it dont taste like it people! Also server had completely forgotten my soup, I had to remind twice, then finally ask for it to go(reminded again after the bill came). My teriyaki chicken was dry and the sauce wasn't so good, the sauce I requested to make it spicy was pretty unappetizing(My server forgot that too, had to remind) (maybe she was stoned?) I think Kyoto Bowl has better Spicy Teriyaki Chicken and even Ra has better sushi(crazy but true)  I wish I could say my drink was good, but alas! I NEVER got it.  ( I kept waiting and wouldn't say anything just to see if she remembered) I wouldn't waste my time here if you want good japanese food and sushi. Go to Ichiban, Sapporo, Stingray, Sushi Brokers, etc. This place blows! PLEASE PLEASE Tempe Marketplace get one GOOD restaurant here!

I love any place that promotes healthy eating and this place is no exception. Their juices are delicious and the food is awesome for vegan style food. I have tried the kale rolls which are filled with some sweet almond paste and cabbage and carrots. Really excellent. I have also had the vegan tacos, but they were out of the usual "meat" so they substituted black bean burger and it was still great. Really great sauces they make here. The place is very homey and has a nice laid back feel and the owner, I think, is very nice and personable. The reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because the service was extremely slow. I do understand they were having problems the last time, but it was also slow the time before. It takes about 15 minutes to get a juice and it took about an hour for our food which came out in pieces. I unfortunately did not get my food until everyone was done eating theirs and my stepdad did not get his iced tea (no ice in it, by the way) until all of us were done eating. He was parched to say the least. I had to take mine to go and was pretty sad about it. I do completely understand the place was having problems, but taking an hour for an iced tea is kind of unacceptable and I think it is much appreciated if everyone gets their food at the same time so we can eat together. Please take my constructive criticism well and hear me out. I want to give this place 5 stars next time! Thanks.

Noca is a great place for a date. It is a culinary experience, with all its style. The chefs are working extremely hard right in front of you and they have many interesting things on the menu. We had appetizers of the duck confit and some sort of sashimi. The duck confit was great and had some really fun elements, like the huckleberry waffle(?) first for me. The sashimi  special was awesome as well. we also received a small sample of a duck mousse,tasted like tuna and mayo, which was alright and some cauliflower soup, yum! I had the duo of Berkshire Pork, which was highly recommended by the waiter. It was good in an artsy sort of way, but I wasn't completely blown away. It said it came with brussel sprouts, but it was really 3 leaves of brussel sprouts, haha funny. The pork chop wasn't so great, apples added depth though, and the pork belly I didn't care for. The demi was good though. The donuts for dessert were pretty good as well. I liked the dulce de leche dip. They gave us some homemade shortbread to take home, very good. The service was wonderful. I did wait at the bar and was suggested a very nice sauv by the bartender. The place is so tiny, reservations are a must, we had to sit outside, but it was a lovely night. I wish this place had some great view overlooking the city instead of the grocery store parking lot. Managers did come up frequently to check on us and gave some insight and great suggestions. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. I will go back and try a different entree and hopefully it will be 5 stars next time. :)

I have been going to this location for awhile and either this place has went downhill or my expectations are way higher. Let me first say it is a Sunday night so it is really dead, of course. The salad bar is just boring, you get an iceberg mix, wilted spinach, a pre-made soggy caesar, and a small bagged mixed greens. There are all the normal veggies, celery, peppers, carrots, you know. The soups were atrocious looking, I tried the lentil veggie and it tasted like a cleaner, blech! I had a baked potato which wasnot completely cooked right with some margarine and sour cream that looks like it was sitting out too long. The breads were hard and bland. Everything was just meh. The state of the place is pretty bad. The carpet is stained and ripped. The booth seats are all ripped, mine was so messed up that i was sitting about shoulder height to the table, the same height as my kids on the other side. The tables were not bussed promptly, Ours wasnt bussed the whole time we were there and I hate sitting with my old buffet dishes while eating my new one. The waitress and another cook went outside to smoke and everyone was looking around for them. A guy was spraying the sneeze guard with cleaner, that can't be good, the spray most likey got on the food, hence the cleaner tasting soup. It was just an uncomfortable experience, I felt ill after leaving.

I have been craving some soul food for quite some time, so I kicked and screamed til someone finally took me to Lolo's. After memorizing the menu for weeks, I knew I wanted the Baby Ray. So we go in and I was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves. I jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes. We were seated in a nice lil half booth/table combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us. Yum! I starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait. When my food did arrive, I was presented with two waffles bigger than my face, 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat. The chicken was spectacular, really good flavor and crisp(when not soaked in gravy, get it on the side?). Gravy was pretty good as well.  The waffles were alright, I can't say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion. I am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake. I could not finish my second waffle though, so much food, couldn't even think. The service was probably a B-. The hostess was bubbly and sweet. Our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe. The server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had. Waiting for the correction was longer than average for sure. Overall, though, I had a good time, perfect way to end my weekend.

I hate to be such a follower, but this place is 4 star worthy for sure. Smashburger opened recently by my house and being such an in-n-out addict (see in-n-out review) I thought I might as well start reviewing other burger joints. This particular joint is located in a uber modern strip mally thing  on College and University I had never seen. I had to park across the street, down a side street, but its all good, it's so nice out. The joint is a minimalistic, classic burger joint style with modern flair. The menu is done up with many yummy, suped up fast food items like smashfries, which are gourmet-ish with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. They have haystack onions and veggie frites for you health conscious fatties out there. They also have dogs and salads(?). Of course the real star is the plethora of burgers and toppings. They have a 1/3, 1/2 and chicken option for each burger and basic cheese and bacon and mushroom types. they also have a make your own with some good toppings, sauces, and buns. What's real fun is the menu for each state its in. I suppose they each have their own "special" burger. We, obviously, have an Arizona burger, which I *obviously* got, to go. (The Iowa burger on the website looks damn good too) The to-go box is so flippin cute! It's a lil chinese lookin take out box, specially made to fit my lil burger in. When I got home, I opened the lil package and saw a cute lil package of yumminess inside. The burger looked beautiful. the lettuce was springy, tomatoes were passable, jalapenos very fresh and spicy. red onions were my only complaint. There were a few all stacked up in the corner a'la how Mcd's does their pickles. The burger itself was very tasty, they must put special seasons in their meat, very nice. The bun was chipotle, pretty good. Overall, a very good, spicy burger that fits the Arizona name well. I will be back, those Haagen-Dazs shakes have my name all over em! (In n Out is still better tho, sry)

Ok this is looong overdue. What can I say about Crudo besides it is amazingly delicious and anyone who enjoys top quality dining should go here. I have been here twice in the past few months and had a wonderful experience both times. Crudo is nestled in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale in, of all places, a salon. Since I have never eaten in a salon, I really didn't know what to expect, let's just say, you cannot even tell there are hair styling or other spa treatments going on behind closed doors. The first time I went I gave the creative chefs full control over what to serve me. I think this is the best way to get a feel for the establishment and, by the way, how many places can you go where you actually get to converse with the chefs? Not many in my experience. Okay, so I gave them the reigns to impress me and they sure did. I had various crudos. Albacore, tuna, butterfish, and snapper were superb and unlike anything I had ever had before. Usually I am reaching for the soy sauce and wasabi, but this small plates of raw fish are delicately marinated and presented with extraordinary compliments like Meyer lemon, truffles, apples, olives, etc. Each dish is unique and delectable in its own way. I think the tuna is my favorite for now, but that may change since the menu is ever evolving, which is a definite sign of chefs who know what they're doing. More points of excitement included an appetizer that had a quail egg and truffles on it. An extreme mushroom creation that also had an egg on it was fabulous. Salads were flavorful and fresh. Risotto was delicious and the gnocchi was melt in your mouth orgasmic. Hmmm, I have to say that everything was great including the table service and wines selected. Crudo has specials (We went for Industry night, half off food) and they also have wine tastings that I need to go to.This is definitely the subtle spot for fine dining without the price tag or snootiness and if you know Scottsdale like I do, that's almost impossible to come by.

I live right down the street and my girls and I often ride our bikes down to the shop on Sunday mornings. The bagels are made fresh everyday, I often would see the windows all fogged with steam as I made my way to work at 5 Am in the winter. The kids love it. I usually get an everything bagel with the veggie cream cheese that they make. I actually have not branched out yet, but I will next time! It is really great when the bagels have just came out hot and you don't even need to toast them.

I am pleasantly surprised by this lil place in the strip mall by Safeway. We had miso soup to start, was great! I like that they put in tofu, green onion and seaweed, other places usually omit one. We had the tataki tuna appetizer with was delicious, seared tuna in a ponzu ginger sauce with masago and green onion with a carrot flower. Crab cream cheese wontons were good, the orange sauce was yummy. My daughter has the sweet and sour chicken kids meal, holy shiznis, it was huge for a kid! so we shared, good times., it was really good. We ordered the teriyaki chicken to share and this iron griddle with lots of veggies and chicken came out sizzling and our server poured on the teriyaki sauce. It was great presentation however, the sauce quickly liquified and sizzled away so the chicken left us wanting more. I would rather have the chicken fully glazed before it is put on the griddle, I think it would have been more flavorful that way. The chef did give us a 4 piece of the pacific roll which was really nice. I am not a fan of deep fried rolls, but I think it was pretty food. I want to say our server was so sweet, she was very attentive, quick,  and just overall nice. All in all, I will say it is a great place with a lot of potential, work on the teriyaki chicken, bring down the prices a lil ( $10 for a philly roll is too much) and get some more homey feeling decor and it is a 5.

Very rude lady on the phone. I cannot review how well they repair due to the bad customer service, I was never able to schedule an appointment. I called to get a quote and she refused unless I had a diagnostic even though I already had one and just needed to know if they have the part and how much it would be to install. When I was trying to explain to her my situation, she said thank you and hung up on me before I could ask any questions. It was so mean and frustrating, I figured she could be a little sympathetic to my situation seeing as how my house is 107 degrees and my air has been off for a week, but I guess not. She did not even ask if I wanted to schedule an appointment.
