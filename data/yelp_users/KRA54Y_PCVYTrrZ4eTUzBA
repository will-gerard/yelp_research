Favorite BBQ ever! Absolutely love the sauce, I'd bathe in it if I could.  Get the pork ribs with a side of fries and mac m cheese. Just be sure to eat the fries while they're hot.

Chill, cool, little spot. I love the fact that you go underground to get to the romantically lit bar area. It's a safe haven from the blistering Arizona sun.   I like to sit by the fire, kick up my feet, and lounge for a few hours.  Get the prickly pear margarita, you won't be sorry.

O gold's. Gotta love this place. All the meatheads and roiders make this gym quite entertaining.   If you're looking for a fitness center with a spa, basketball court, and a rock wall don't even bother. It's as basic as it gets which is good and bad depending on your style.   They have all the necessities like cardio machines, free weights, and weight machines and offer a few classes.   Really glad I joined. Not nearly as crowded as some places I've gone and it's only $10 a month so I can't complain.   Only thing I wish they did is put a little more effort into maintenance. Bathrooms and locker rooms are always clean but the machines and weights are a little dingy sometimes.

Absolutely hated the two years I went to school there. One of the most disorganized establishments I've ever had to deal with.  No one in admissions, registration, or the cashier's office knew what the heck they were doing.  I was constantly told one thing and ended up having to do the other. The simplest things like singing up for a class turned into week long processes that never went through. The advisers were no help at all and ended up setting me back a year by telling me to take the wrong classes.    However, there were a few good teachers I met that genuinely tried to help.  Be sure to use rate my professor though because others sucked.

The best fried chicken in all of Charlotte. Taking home a full of Price's chicken is one of the most satisfying feelings in the whole world.  It's crispy and easy to suck down, you tell yourself you're only going to have two pieces but end up having ten. The sides aren't anything special but they aren't bad. I wish they had mac n cheese but you don't get everything you wish for.  Not a sit down place but the staff is still friendly. It's best to call ahead, pick up your order, and then chow down.

Starting to trust this place less and less. Ever since they switched managers a year or so ago things seem to have changed.   It started when my check engine light came on and they checked it out for me. The told me the error code that the car was supposedly giving and said it would be about $400 to fix. Took it to two other places to get another opinion and they both disagreed with Meineke. I ended up being able to fix it for $150 at Goodyear and haven't had any trouble with the car since.   After that I decided to only go here for oil changes. But even then the place seems to give off a sleezy vibe and I no longer trust the work they do.  Maybe it's just me but I'm going to start looking elsewhere.

Awesome bar! One of the first bars I actually went to after turning 21 and now I constantly wanna go back. No matter what kind of mood I'm in I always feel comfortable and relaxed once I'm there.   They play good music and at a decent volume so I don't have to shout at the person sitting next to me. Some nights they have specials like $2 shots and what not.   Love going to Seamus with my friends, sitting in my usual seat, and hanging out for a good hour or five. I like that it's not crowded with a bunch of woo girls but is a much more mellow place.

Heaven in a box! This tiny little dump is amazing.  I got a little nervous when I pulled up and I saw that the restaurant was more of a four walled building with an oven inside than an actual sit down place, but I was not disappointed. Big portions, great taste, and good value.  Only drawback is that the sitting area isn't air conditioned so in the summer it gets pretty toasty and there are a number of flies buzzing at your plate. Nevertheless, the food is awesome and I'll definitely be going back.

Ghetto but spectacular. I constantly wake up craving their beautiful red and seasoned chicken cooked on an open flame.  This is my favorite make your own burro type of place that I've been going to since I was little.  Don't expect chimichangas and re-fried beans cause that's not their style. They have a small but satisfying menu consisting of mainly chicken.    Only downside to this place is that it can get pretty toasty when the fire pit is going and it's the middle of summer.

If you don't like Amelie's, heaven help you! This is a sweet and pastry paradise. Tons of variety and they always add or mix up the options. They even have small portions so you don't have to feel guilty about picking out ten desserts. I've never been disappointed with anything but the tarts are my favorite.  The staff is always willing to answer questions and help you pick something out. Unique French themed decor matched with a positive vibe. My only complaint is that I don't live there.

Good place to go and catch virtually any game because they have about 10 tvs in every room. But the food is ehh and the waiters are hit or miss. First time I went I had absolutely horrible service, which is why it's getting two stars. The second time I went they didn't wow me but were much better.

This is more of a review on paradise bakery in general not just this location.  Way overrated and overpriced.  I keep trying to convince myself that this place is good but I just don't see it.  Every time I go I try and pick something that can't be messed up and I know I'll love.  Unfortunately that never seems to happen.  I'm always left wishing I had ordered something else or nothing at all.

Weird little establishment put together with a weird crowd.  Maybe it was just this Friday night but everything about it was pretty obnoxious down to the server, clientele, and DJ blasting music. It seemed like the employees were doing the bare minimum and didn't really wanna help anyone.

AMAZINGGGGGGG! I loved walking in and having the smell of a fresh toasted sandwich in my nose.   The owners are super Italian and the main guy makes sure everyone is taken care of and is having a good time. He loves fifties music and signs along with it while he's making crepes.   I ordered the grilled cheese which has sharp cheddar, tomatoes, pesto, and avocado. I'm usually picky and like my food to be as simple as possible but the sandwich was awesome. My friend got a southwest sandwich which has chicken and peppers which was also really good.   We ended up staying there for two hours cause we became so comfortable with the place and the staff. The owner even gave us a free banana crepe with ice cream.   The only reason it doesn't get a full five stars is because there was miss communication between our waiter and the chef. We had to wait for quite a while to order because our waiter thought we had already put it in. The other downside is that it was a tid bit pricey for not including any sides like fries or chips. But still loved it overall.

The most poorly organized and poorly managed apartment complex I have ever lived in.  From the very beginning my cousin and I were promised one thing but the opposite ended up happening. We were told that utilities were included, rent was a certain price, we would both have assigned parking spots, there wasn't a deposit for pets, and the list goes on.  However, none of these things ended happening.  We had to pull teeth to get what they said was all included.  Maintenance was a joke! Trying to get anything fixed took weeks of nagging, mainly because no one is ever in the office.  The girl on sight had very limited office hours and even then she couldn't seem to keep them.  Even when I tried to take my complaints up the latter I couldn't get a response. No one here knows what the heck they're doing.  Unless there is gun being held to your head, don't rent here.
