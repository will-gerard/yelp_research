Best Halloween Party in the valley.   Get your friends organized and come to this Halloween party.   It is awesome.   I have gone two years now and am amazed at the creativity and boldness of the costumes.   It is a perfect venue.   It is really like roaming around in a haunted house.   Two live bands and the drink prices were reasonable.    Hey,  two girls were only wearing body paint!  Wow.  The view at sunset is just breathtaking.    Great place for a really special date.

Ruby Red Crab Legs ....YUM!    (There is a big $$ though for this Yumminess!....$70).   We started our meal with the N'awlins Shrimp appetizer.   Cajun spices but with "little itty bitty" shrimp.   It was just OK.   We actually ate at the bar.    The bartender, Brian, was very attentive.  Of course he was, we were the only two people in the bar for two hours on a Saturday night.   The bar is good size so that has to be a bad sign for Steamers.  Can you imagine what their rent could be in The Biltmore on 24th St. and Camelback??  When I read Brad H.'s review of Steamer's,  I was touched by his story of the "Lovely lady who is now his wife"  who he proposed to at Steamer's.   Brad,  do you have a twin brother????  What a nice guy you are!

Testosterone central.  This is a great man destination.   The suite is really large including a giant humidor, private club and unique gifts.  I am not a cigar smoker, but I think there must be a fabulous selection as large as the area is!  The owner, Jeff, showed me the private club.   (One of the last places you could legally  smoke in public.)  The private part has 3 - 42" TV's, wine cooler, wet bar and ice machine.    The Barware is very different ; olive cocktail stirrers, collectible beer glasses, corkscrews etc.  The smoking accessories are interesting.   I saw lighters, tampers, humidors etc.

ok... I am a "Thai Virgin".    We got to Thai Basil and got the menu and we were a bit overwhelmed.   Once we settled down and actually started to read the menu items,  we ordered Pad See Ew with pork and Spicy Rice with Shrimp.    We ended with Fried Bananas with Ice Cream.  All I can say  is  -  YUM!    I'll be back.

Summer special- buy one service and second service is half price.   I went with three friends for the first time.   I don't know how it is we never went before?   We go to spas often.   This is right near where I live and seems to be a "secret".    The facility is quite frankly, fabulous.   It is unique since they stay true to the Native American culture in all they do.   I had a custom facial with Portia.   I like this since I know the aestitician certainly knows better what my skin needs than me just randomly picking a facial.   It was wonderful.  We had lunch in the spa.   The chef cooks each persons lunch to order.   The food was very different and we all really liked what we ordered.   After lunch I had a massage with Kelly.   Once again, it was just great.   After our spa services, we got a golf cart ride over to the pool so we could go down the giant slide into the swimming pool.   We had a ball.   This is our new local spa destinaiton.  We will never go back to any of our old haunts.

Who doesn't want fabulous skin and hair? This is not the most calm and beautifully decorated spa and salon but what great services. The facials are THE BEST! I am a spa girl and I am really impressed. I have had Margaret and Tammy both do facials and am equally impressed with both. Their individual rooms are quiet and clean. I also have Kelly Hill do my hair and she is the bomb. She does a Brazilian hair treatment that is just crazy. I never in my adult life remember having my hair feel so healthy! It also calms curl and frizz. Come on, no frizz is all good, right? I understand people drive from all over the valley for the waxing services. That is next on my list!

Arizona restaurant week,  What an idea!  Three course meals for $29.  I loved this venue.    I went with two girlfriends.   Be sure to ask for a booth rather than a table.   I started with the Chop salad (Avacado, bacon, hearts of palm, tomato, blue cheese and red wine vinaigrette)   Main course was the roast filet of King Salmon northwest spice rubbed and roasted with a touch of huckleberries.    My friends had Colorado Lamb chops and double cut pork chops.   I finished with  carmel chocolate Creme Brulee with passion fruit.   The best presentation of the evening though was the hand rolled chocolate cigar dipped in hazelnut croquant frangelico anglasie.   It had an "ash tray and matches" on the plate.  Sounds nuts,  I know, but it was really great.    Our waiter, Angel, was there just enough and carried on the right amount of conversation.  Yves Leger, the wine steward, knows his wine!   He is from France!   I think we embarrassed him when we asked him to say something romantic in French.   He did speak French BUT it was probably his address.  It sounded wonderful whatever he said.    This is a very nice "special date" spot.

The owner  is a member of the Phoenix Symphony.     He has met so many interesting people.   When you go in, make it a point to talk to him.    A unique neighborhood stop.  Not the drive thru Starbuck's experience.   Free WIFI.

I have been to 56 East Bar and Kitchen a handful of times and always have a very nice time.  Corey, the bartender, is very attentive to everyone.  He made great suggestions on menu selections.  Honestly, I never would have ordered what I did but he explained what the item was and I tried it.  It was a pizza with egg on top.   Sounds awful, I know,  BUT it was awesome.    We all loved the  food.   We could actually talk to each other and carry on a conversation.   So many places are too noisy.    I really like 56 when they can open the window behind the bar.   My only suggestion might be to find a way to have some plants behind the patio to block the view of the parking lot.  This is a real review of a place I have actually been to!

Have you gone to Cosmic Bowling???   Flashing lights, great music, and competitive sport!  You really need to arrive at about 8:30.   You will be given a "beeper" for getting a lane at 10PM.    If you get there much later you will be out of luck for Cosmic bowling.   It fills up fast.  While you wait, you can play pool, games, have a drink, and eat.  I think this is best with a group of friends.   is it possible to say you are getting exercise while you are drinking??   A good idea is to take a cab or have a designated driver.   I did notice a police car sitting in the parking lot when the bowling ended.    DUI can change your life... and not in a good way.  I would say the only downfall is how much you can spend.   Two of us spent over $60 without eating and a pitcher of beer.   It really is fun.

I have driven by King's so many times and wondered how the food was.   I finally went in for dinner Saturday after a movie and was pleasantly surprised.   I had grilled catfish, rosemary potatoes and spinach.   It was great.  My friend had the trout and he loved it.  It is a little pricey though.    BTW, the movie..... Shatter Island... HATED it.    I know hate is a strong word But I really HATED it.

One of my top ten embarrassing moments happened here one evening.  I agreed to meet a blind date here.   There was a ton of road construction with detours signs and flashing lights.  It seemed darker than dark in Queen Creek.   I really don't know that area and couldn't read any of the street signs.   My Secret deodorant was working full time.  I was getting NERVOUS.  Missed the real parking lot and got my little car stuck in the dirt NEAR the parking lot.   Some random cowboy got my car out.    Great first impression right.   Well, the cowboy was very sweet.     At least this restaurant is fun.   Rib Eye Steak was great with San Tan  secret seasoning.   (If they told us what was in it, they would have to kill us)    The outside patio is what I like most.  Something different.   It is like camping but cleaner.   There is live music and dancing.   This is a popular motorcycle enthusiast destination.

Susan G Komen 3 day for the Cure 60 mile walk = better shoes than what I got on sale at "Who Knows Where" shoe store. Just the thought of walking 20 miles a day makes my feet scream. I wanted shoes that actually fit correctly and socks that will wick moisture. Saturday is a busy day at Road Runner BUT they had a load of employees running the show. I had to wait about 25 minutes to get on the treadmill and start the process. Chris was very informative and pleasant. Other employees were very attentive while I waited. Once I started the fitting process, it went like a well oiled machine. Everyone was very friendly and I noticed employees were helping each other and cleaning up the shoe boxes and socks as they did their other responsibilities. I never thought buying shoes could be such a pleasurable experience.

One of my favorite neighborhood New York Italian restaurants.   Why not start with dessert?  Canoli, cheesecake, and tiramisu. YUM.   They have a nice wine selection with specials on Wednesdays.  Sunday is family night.   Baked clams, seafood pasta, bolognese, lasagna....ok , I may have to jump in my car and head over there!  So nice to not go to one of the chain restaurants.   They do catering too.   The only downfall is lunchtime.   They seem to arrive just before the patrons?

My Chihuahua, Elvis, and I are in a Doggie Social Club and we meet here once a month.   The 110-acre Riparian Preserve at Water Ranch is located just east of the intersection at Guadalupe and Greenfield roads in Gilbert, Arizona. The purpose of the Institute is to preserve valuable natural resources, create and conserve scarce riparian areas, and protect wildlife habitats.  Quite an ambitious goal.  The Riparian Institute is a non-profit organization formed by the Town of Gilbert, with of mission of promoting awareness and appreciation of Arizona's ecology and natural history, particularly desert and riparian environments. The Institute offers a variety of education and recreation programs,  ranger-led walks, family bird walks,  youth programs (bird walks, nature hikes, dinosaur and archaeological digs, astronomy viewings, and camping), and group lessons on conservation, ecology, water, plants and wildlife.  Who knew how cool this is!   You need to go with or without a dog!

"I had low back pain for 3 years from a car accident.  During that time I went to chiropractors, physical therapy, orthopedic surgeon, a pain specialist, acupuncturist, massage and stretch therapy with minimal relief.  Within 1 month after one  PRP treatment my pain is down to a zero.  Dr. Cronin did a great job and her treatment was easy.  I wish I would have done it sooner. "  L.H.  Phoenix, AZ
