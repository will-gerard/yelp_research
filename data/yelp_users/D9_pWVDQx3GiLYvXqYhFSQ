My girlfriend had 2 skirts altered by this place. Both for work purposes. The reason I am posting about this and not her is because I was the one who had to go pick it up and pay for it.   I was amazed at how much it had cost for two business style skirts to get altered. They  had both sides taken in ( to make smaller). $36 a skirt for a grand total of $72. I came with $45 thinking that would cover the "cash only" rule that still exists in today's world. So then I had to leave, go to an ATM then back to the place. Thinking the whole time, "Might as well go buy her a new skirt," but I have no fashion and she needed them!  So two weeks later and $72 in the hole we have skirts that fit.   Is it great work yes. The people were really nice. If I needed it done over night I would probably pay that price. Inflating prices because of slow business.  Business denied

Once I tried this place for the first time I knew it was an instant favorite.The best part about Sal's is that you can go there and have 3 different experiences. Let me explain, there is the restaurant part - great atmosphere, dimmed lights, with conversations as the background noise. There is also the bar area, which has a limited menu, all which is excellent. With TV's and high top tables. Lastly, "The Side Door." It is connected only through the kitchen and is almost a sub-restaurant to Sal's. Same menu but again, a different atmosphere.   As far as food goes, we get the stuffed mushrooms every time. UNBELIEVABLE with the garlic bread. Must have - I don't even like mushrooms. The bianco pizza is fantastic. It is a white pizza which my gf is addicted too.  If I would give it another star, the service would have to be better. Not saying the people aren't nice, but you really have to plan on being there for an hour or more. I might be a really picky person though.   I would recommend to anyone who appreciates italian food.   www.nate.phxestates.com

I work for Remax Platinum Living in the DC Ranch area. We are located right next to AJ's so I have the pleasure of going there 4-5 times a week. Their service is immaculate. When there is a line, another cashier/manager will step up and help. My routine is to get their tea. It's classic China Mist, over the tiny pebble ice cubes. They also have great Arnold Palmers. My favorite is "Green Tea-Mango-Lemonade Arnold Palmer.  Lunch: Their lunch specials are ridiculous... I usually go with a Burger and fries or burger and bacon bbq baked beans for $6.99. Its a great value for what you get. Why would you choose McDonald's?   Don't worry my rabbit folks. Make your own gourmet salad and choose from over 8 dressings. The Sal's bar is loaded. (And clean)  Bottom line is this location (not that others aren't) is a very clean, professional, and customer friendly market/deli. It sets the bar very high.   Come sit on the patio and check it out!!   Oh yeah, if you know someone who is looking to buy , sell, or invest in real estate. I would love your referral!

Well I went back for a second time because the food was great. My girl friend and I love the cheese bread and pizza.  And believe it or not they have some of the best ranch. No I'm not a picky person but I do appreciate good ranch, not that hidden valley stuff. So they have good food and great ranch.   But that's it.  My complaint is not with the staff, they are relatively friendly, and young. Both of which aren't bad things. They have no guidance.   Management is terrible!  The place is filthy, always understaffed, and filthy. It was Friday night, the floor hadn't been swept, the tables around us were not bussed, and the soda area was disgusting. I would say 10 tables didn't have anybody sitting at them when we walked in, and 8 of them were dirty. I had to wipe my own table because I didn't want to next to the kid section.   Management here's some advise. Always over schedule, and make cuts. Your restaurant is in a great location. And it is Friday night. If your place was cleaner than your business would thrive. You might get regulars.   If I was you I would hire four teenage boys to just bus tables and sweep floors. Nothing else.   That or actually ride your staff and push them harder. I wouldn't allow their armpits on the kitchen window either.   Stop leaning.

Cannot speak highly enough of Ryan and the Repair Guys. My clients home has had a slow leak happening due to a bad roof... Its been going on for years. Ryan and the guys came out to inspect on very short notice. Like 4 hour notice, lol, can't thank them enough for that! Anyways, everywhere they looked there was a problem. Facia were rotted, cracked tiles, water resistant paper torn up (elephant skin), and obvious signs of leakage everywhere.   Keep in mind 'the repair guys' only repair roofs, they don't install. So he could have charged us $10,000 for repairs and walked away. But he said that "he wouldn't be able to sleep at night." knowing he repaired a roof that will probably need replaced in 2 years. Saving the homeowner loads of money (just replacing the whole thing through another company).  Basically repairing the roof was only putting a band aide on a gunshot wound.   If you are looking for honest roofers that won't take advantage of your 'lack of knowledge' these are the guys!  Best.

Moved here a year and 6 months ago from our apartment in Scottsdale. It's the perfect location next to the 202. Very convenient for my work and my wife's. I feel like im on vacation when laying by the pool. There is always complimentary water and Starbucks coffee (not that Keurig crap).  At night we simply put or trashcan outside our door and a trash service comes to pick it up. Easy peezy.   The staff is hands down the best! Front office gets an A and even an A+ when Albert is running the place. Adam and Justin fix and handle just about everything. They are always friendly! My dog likes them both. Lol   I would recommend this community to anyone looking for an upscale, safe place to live.

Bespoke is your modern day salon that is full of energetic and smiling faces when you walk in. They make feeling welcome a number one priority. Some of my favorite things about Bespoke is the design, hip music, and location.  I'm always offered a soda, water, maybe even a cold brewski when I arrive for my appointment.   My stylist is Brittany Christine. Let me first start with the head massage she gives you when rinsing your hair. Amazing! I always put my trust in her with the latest styłes and have recently tried a new look which everyone loves (if I don't say so myself). Its great to see each a stylist ask their coworkers for an opinion or advice when cutting your hair. It shows how much they actually care about the way you look and getting a variety of opinions is always nice!  I would highly recommend giving this salon a shot. It is managed correctly, has great employee's and is ready to Lower your ears!

Customer service at its finest! Their team was able to educate my fiancé and I on the newest flooring. We wanted something that was "in" for my new home. My fiancé was able to see real life displays to help us make our choice. I would refer them to anyone in Scottsdale looking to put in new floors!

Legacy Landscaping and Pools have the systems and crew you need to get the job done right in a timely manor. We had just entered escrow on a home and had a general home inspection done that noted "pool to be inspected by qualified, licensed pool tech" for some issues our general inspector could not help us with.  Since we were in a time sensitive inspection period (10 days in AZ) Greg and his team were able to squeeze us in within a day or two to conduct a 15 point inspection of the equipment and pool.   It is was a good thing we had Legacy Landscaping and Pools come out because there were several issues that would have cost myself and my family thousands of dollars $$$!!! If you are looking for a company that utilizes modern technology, has experience, is flexible and shows up ON TIME then Legacy Landscaping and Pools is who you need to call!

We had a blast working with Nathan at Urban Luxe Partners. He was very thorough and accurate with all of the information he provided us. His market knowledge is unparalleled to any other agent.  I would recommend him and his team to anyone looking to buy sell or invest!
