They did great work at a great price and were friendly and helpful in the process.  I needed some cushions and an umbrella restitched for a big party and they got them turned around on time and they look like new.  I'm not going to wait so long the next time I need something fixed in the back yard.

May well be the BEST falafel in town. Definitely the best I've ever had in the Phoenix metro. All homemade from dry, raw garbanzo and fava beans, family spice mix, etc. The spicy buffalo hummus is great as well!

It's a Blimpie.  What can you say?  Well, for one thing, you can say that the meat is sliced fresh - unlike other places named for underground trains and whose meat was sliced and packaged in a factory somewhere.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean and the food is good.  They have some good $5 specials now for either a footlong sandwich or a 6" sandwich meal.  Get yo' Blimpie on!  Oh, and don't forget the sweet peppers.  Those bad boys rock!

The Lowdown: bad falafel, decent hummus  Went here in search of a falafel fix. What I found was a place whose falafel is in need of a fix. It was dry, tasteless and crumbled throughout the pita. I kept looking at it, sampling small pieces of it, and trying to decide if they'd given me the right sandwich.  They had. It was sad.   It was a meal I will soon forget. At least I hope to. The only thing memorable is its place as the least tasty falafel to ever hit my palate.   Service was attentive and the hummus was pretty decent.

Eden's is a small family-owned restaurant where we have received good service and good food on multiple occasions.   Coming from someone on a vegan diet, this place is an appropriate stand-in for its namesake - the Garden of Eden.  There are lots of options that have absolutely no eggs or dairy in them - which is sometimes hard with Mediterranean food.  The hummus and baba ganoush were both very good.  I would highly recommend the vegetarian appetizer - it's a meal in itself - as well as the vegetarian plate.  They were more than willing to make a couple of substitutes to accomodate dietary restrictions.  We'll be back.

We've only made one visit to the Twisted Lizard and our experience was a good one.  A friend mentioned it as being a good place to watch Nebraska football games so we decided to try it out.  For what we were looking for, it was perfect.  Laid back atmosphere, plenty of TVs, good food and good service.   We had some kind of a garden (veggie) lahvosh and the BBQ sliders (pork, beef and chicken combo).  Both were good.

With 4 kids always clamoring for dessert, take my word for it when I say we've sampled just about every yogurt place in the Scottsdale area.  Our family verdict is unanimous: Yogurtology is the best! Best flavors, best quality, best consistency, etc. etc.  (BTW, it's not often that you get our 4 kids to agree on ANYTHING)  We event went "Scottsdale" and brought our dog this last time to sample their doggie yogurt.  She never looked up until it was gone.  And, much to our delight, she had no issues afterwards (don't want to get too graphic, but I think you all probably know what can happen when you give a dog something that doesn't agree with his/her system : )  The Oatmeal Cookie flavor rocks! Get some raisins from one of the granola canisters to complete the recipe.

Consistently good food with some unique flavors and new twists on old favorites. Not your typical diner/breakfast joint.

I can't believe I'm recommending a place that serves Chinese, Hawaiian and Sushi.  And I'm still having a hard time to believe I summoned the courage to try the place.  I would usually turn tail and run, but I trusted my fellow Yelpers and gave it a shot.  They were spot on!  There were six in our group (2 adults, 4 kids) and everyone's dish was legit - and a great portion for the price.    I'm still thinking about the Mongolian Chicken I ordered.  Wow!  Asian Island, I'm so glad I don't need a boat to get to you cuz I'm coming back!

Check, please!  For some reason, mostly one-word descriptions come to mind... The first is "overpriced."  The shrimp and corn cheese crisp was $11+.  Second word: "skimpy."  For almost $12, that little cheese crisp should have been covered in shrimp and corn.  I actually had to ask my wife if there was any corn as I searched out one of the micro-shrimps.  Third word: "Meh."  We tried three items to get a variety and a feel for the place and none of them was memorable or anything I would choose to go back for.  The tortilla soup was more like a party dip than a soup, the cheese crisp had hardly anything on it, and the portion of the unmemorable signature dish was pretty small for $16.  For my money, I'll definitely be heading to Blanco next time.  Black Chile seems to be an imitator that falls flat - like a bad impersonation act at an Arizona casino.  Thank God I had a $20 off coupon.  The $16 total seemed a whole lot more appropriate than the original $36.

A great place for vegan desserts and other novelties. My non-vegan kids love their tsoynamis particularly the cookie dough infused Dough Boy.

Tried the Green location on Scottsdale at the start of our vegan journey. The food wasn't bad, it just didn't resonate with me. Fast forward about 3 years. I've had tasty vegan food in all kinds of places from Hawaii to the West Coast to the Heartland of America and on to NYC and Philly.   I had time today to do something different and make a longer than usual drive, so I hit Green on 7th St. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I was informed that the Big WAC was highly recommended and had won some awards. Back in the day, I enjoyed a Big Mac now and then and then again. The idea of revisiting those flavors in a vegan wrapper sparked an interest and my order was placed.   I was not disappointed. The burger arrived in a timely fashion and looked like a Big Mac's big brother -- and tasted like it too. All the flavors were there: two twin patties, special sauce, lettuce, "cheese", pickles, onions, and even a sesame seed bun! I'm no longer surprised this burger has been recognized nationally. It is seriously legit! My favorite vegan burger happens to reside thousands of miles away in Philly, but some more visits here and further exploration of the menu may just change all of that.   'Twas a good day to do something different!

I've made a few more visits to Green since my original review and have become a big fan. On my last visit I had the Drunken Mongolian bowl with mock beef. I had them spice it up a little with some chile paste and the flavors were amazing. The mock beef is made from white mushrooms. It held the Mongolian flavors very well and had great texture. It's definitely on my ordering short list now.

Who knows? Maybe we caught them on a bad day. Or maybe on their worst day.   Service: Host/server/cashier greeted us and told us to sit wherever we wanted. He then proceeded to sit at a table with (presumably) his friends and focus on his phone for the duration of our entire meal. He finally brought us a warmer-than-room-temperature bottle of water when we were finished with everything.   Food: Nothing noteworthy or memorable. 3 soups and a dal dish that had the consistency of a soup, corn masala, a paneer dish, rice, a few desserts for good measure and boom! you have a $10.50 buffet ticket.   This was my second visit. The first was a takeout order -- also not very memorable, but decent.   I don't think I'll be going back.

Finally a store in Scottsdale!  That's definitely something to YELP about!  Which Wich is without question my favorite among franchise sandwich shops.  I actually discovered my first Which Wich in San Diego while driving around looking for an alternative to Subway and Quizno's - I was burned out on both of them!  Tired of the fake looking meat and trays of chicken going into the microwave at Subway.  Tired of Quizno's getting rid of all of the sandwiches I liked.  It was love at first sight when I walked into that San Diego store and spotted one of my personal favorites on the menu - the Monte Cristo.  Given the bread isn't dipped in batter and it doesn't have 8,000 calories like the classic sandwich does, but it was a FAR cry better than Subway.  And it hit the spot BIG TIME!  Since then, we've been to Which Wich dozens of times and sampled nearly everything on the menu.  Here's what I can tell you... The bread is delicious, the ingredients are fresh, the meat is real, and the ordering system is spectacular!  The kids love it.  We love it.  It's unanimous!  Believe me when I tell you... that doesn't happen often in a family with 4 kids.  Here's a personal favorite of mine you can try when ordering.  Someone at the Scottsdale store helped me coin its name... the Medi-Troy-anean (as in Mediterranean)  Grab Bag #4 - Chicken Then mark the following circles: Chicken Wheat Bread Toasted (pick your size) Pepper Jack Cheese Hummus Tzatziki Tomatoes Cucumbers Olive Salad Salt Pepper  This sandwich is LEGIT and took years to develop. Well, ok, it may have just been a few visits but still... it's full of phenomenal amounts of deliciousness!!!

This is an update to my previous review where I shared my formerly top-secret recipe for the best WW chicken sandwich in the West.  Having taken a 180 degree turn in my diet, I will no longer be eating that amazing chicken sandwich, but, do not fear! There is hope -- thanks to the WW black bean patty.  As a matter of fact, the already world-class sandwich may be even better *without* chicken.  Here's how you roll....vegetarian style!  Grab Bag #6 -- Vegetarian  Then mark the following circles... Black Bean Patty Wheat Bread Toasted (pick your size) Pepper Jack Cheese (optional) Hummus Tzatziki Tomatoes Cucumbers Olive Salad Salt Pepper  Bam!  Pay your tab and wait for the slab of delicious goodness to emerge!  Hint:  write something unique on the back of your bag so you can track it down the assembly line.

We found the flavors to be exceptional.  Definitely some of the best-tasting Thai food we have found in the Scottsdale area.  So glad we gave Cha Da Thai a shot.  This review would have been a 5-star rating except for the fact that our Pad Thai was pretty dry.  Since it was a to go order it's a little tough to gauge how much of that was due to preparation and how much was due to delay in consuming it.  Ordering extra sauce on the side may have been a simple remedy.

Great food, reasonably priced and large portions. I like the wide assortment of grilled veggies as well as the addition of tofu as a protein option. Choose a base (quinoa, brown or basmati rice), a protein (beef, chicken, tofu), choose your veggies and a sauce -- or as I like to do it, a blend of sauces.   Having brought multiple friends here as first timers, I have gotten nothing but excellent responses from them. I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options and my friends enjoy the beef and chicken options. Everything has been tasty tasty tasty!  I was a fan of the old Bombay and continue to be a fan - probably because I come for the food, not the atmosphere. While hesitant about the change at first, I now enjoy the flexibility that this style of restaurant provides.   For those who only came when it first opened, some things have changed - including the assortment of available vegetables. As a vegan diner, I was a little concerned about my options. However, I think they've done a good job of adapting to a changing market as well as the input of their loyal customers. Now, if I could just get them to bring the Korma sauce back. : )

Hoping to be able to update this review after another visit, but the first one was a little disappointing. I came here because of the vegetarian and vegan options available. Unfortunately, it started off poorly when they informed me that they didn't have enough falafel to complete our order. We substituted some other items, but the substituted salad ended up covered in feta and, therefore, rendered inedible for my wife and me.  It wouldn't have been a big deal except for the dairy-free discussion when ordering and the fact that it was a to-go order. I didn't have the time to make a 40 minute round trip drive to get a new salad. As I said, hopefully things will go better next time. I was hoping for a better experience.   The falafel was pretty good -- I'd go back for it. But I stand by my claim that Saba's has the best falafel in the Valley.

It is always a good sign when the ethnicity of 90% of the customers matches the ethnicity of the food being served. This was my experience at Mint Indian Cuisine today.   I gave the restaurant a four-star rating for the number of options available on the lunch buffet, the flavor and quality of the food, and the overall customer experience. I was very pleased as well at the number of vegetarian and vegan options on the buffet.  The food was tasty, the staff friendly and helpful and the price reasonable.   While the $11.99 price tag is a little higher than I'd like, the variety of options and quantity of food make it a decent value. If I can have three different flavors for a tad more than I'd pay for one in a non-buffet setting, I see that as a good deal.   I don't see much difference from my previous visits when the restaurant was under a different name, other than the extremely friendly gentleman that greeted me, showed me the buffet and gave me a seat at the bar.
