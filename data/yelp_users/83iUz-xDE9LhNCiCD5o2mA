This is going to sound depressing but I'm trying to eat healthier so I came here & got a salad... it was sad because the sandwiches are SO good. BUT.... the salad was delicious. I got the tuna salad & it was very light, couldn't tell if mayonnaise was mixed in, if so, very little. Tons of veggies & tuna that I didn't even have to put a dressing on it. So satisfied with this meal when I thought I was going to be depressed, strongly recommend!

This place is near my boyfriends softball fields so we stopped by before for happy hour. Tuesdays they have a blue moon special for $3 so I got that & the bf got another beer. We got $6 boneless wings ; $10 combo platter, & a side of flies (not sure the price). The boneless wings were AMAZING, I think we got the flavor "Jess", oh my gosh delicious. The combo platter was HUGE for the two of us, potato skins were decent, mozzarella sticks were good but different (in a wonton wrapper), onion rings were great, and the pretzel sticks were awesome. These all came with a bunch of sauces -- marinara, cheese, & ranch. We also got steak fries on the side which were delicious as well. All of the food & beers (5 total - two 16oz & three 22 oz) for $40, cant beat that -- we will definitely be back.

Had a LivingSocial that I bought months ago & finally went on Saturday for dinner, the day before it expired. Had a reservation at 8:15 PM, arrived around 8PM and they seated us right away. Our waitress, Ali, was really good and said she had only been working there 2 months. The LivingSocial I got was only $40 and included 2 salads, cheese fondue, 2 entrees, and our waitress included chocolate for us. Amazing deal IMO. We also got a bottle of wine which was $29 & upgraded the cooking style to the Coq Au Vin - which was great, worth the extra $6. Now for my review of the food:  *Salad - got the Caesar & House salad, both were good, I recommend putting the Garlic & Wine Seasoning on it *Cheese Fondue - we got the Spinach Artichoke ; it was amazing! I love how fresh it is, you actually watch them put every ingredient into the pot.  *Individual Entrée Main Course - we got to pick 2 so we got the Filet Mignon & the All Natural Breast of Chicken. The steak was really good & both of our favorites. The chicken was okay, it didn't have much flavor and was a little bland, I kept having to dip it in the different sauces that are given to you. Next time, I would get something besides the chicken. Also, this comes with a bowl of vegetables -- potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. I paired them with the green goddess and bleu cheese sauces. YUM! *Chocolate course - unfortunately I cannot review this because we got it to-go and then left it at the table :( bummer!  Anyways, it was a great meal, something different then a typical date night somewhere else. I would probably be more likely to come back with a LivingSocial or Groupon deal just because it isn't cheap.

Bought a new car (ILX 2016) on Saturday & had such a positive experience. Patrick Aigner was so helpful & not pushy like you get at other dealerships. You can tell that he genuinely cares about his customers & wants to help to get them the best deal possible while providing amazing customer service. Also, Virginia in finance was very nice & helpful as well. I had such a great experience and am excited to a part of the Acura family :)

Cool "dive-y" Irish Pub in DT Phx. We were going to escape the room at the Puzzle Room a few blocks away so we decided to grab some drinks & apps first. Typical Irish bar with the Harp, Smithwicks, Guinness of course. People in my group said the Guinness wasn't great, sort of flat. I got Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap. YUM! And then my boyfriend & I split Potato Skins & Mozzarella Sticks. The potato skins were good, the bacon bits on top were a little soft and maybe kind of old, but its bar food. My hopes weren't super high. Overall, they were good. Mozzarella sticks were also pretty good. I would come back again if I was in the area & looking for a chill, hangout with friends type of place.

I told my friend that I would treat her to whatever she wanted for dinner last night for her birthday& she said she wanted Filibertos. Was not expecting that, but sure, why not. I have only ever had breakfast burritos there so coming for dinner was new to me. I got the carne asada burrito & it was delicious. I think it was around $7 & then I ordered a side of sour cream for like $1, & the burrito was huge!! My friend ordered 2 tacos & a bean burrito, boy were we surprised at how much food that was. The tacos were $3 each and basically had like double the tortillas under them and were hugeeeeee. One of those could have been my meal.   So glad I discovered that filibertos is also good for other meals, not just breakfast ;)

Good local Mexican spot in Mesa. My friend lives right down the street so we went on Fri night for takeout & I was really impressed. The food was relatively inexpensive & delicious. I got the carne asada burrito -- fresh & tasty. They don't seem to have a menu posted anywhere online or a website so we had to go in to place a to-go order. Wait for food was 10-15 minutes (so we got a margarita while waiting!). I will definitely come back when in the area!

Great selection at very reasonable prices. The phoenix butcher shop presence doesn't seem to be great, but glad we found this place. We got a 7lb pork butt for $25, smoked it for 13 hours& it was amazing! Cant wait to come back for more!

Not the BEST BBQ I've ever had but pretty good!! Its conveniently located right across the street from my work so its a good, quick lunch. Got the pulled pork sandwich and it was yummy, the bread its sort of different, its like buttery? I wish I was hungry enough to try some of the sides!! Will update this review when I go back & try some.

First time to this stadium this weekend & compared to many others I've been to I was pretty disappointed. TINY lawn area. We had a group of 10 or so & we couldn't find anywhere to sit as the game was starting so we stood in the back corner & I could barely see anything. Also, there was one bathroom near us with only 3 stalls in it & the line was minimum 10 people all game.. insane! I'm not a Giants fan so I have no loyalty to this team/field... will definitely stick to the others (ie:  Cubs in Mesa, and Dbacks/Rockies at Salt River in Scottsdale!)

Pretty bummed about the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. I haven't been in 4 years or so but I remember it being so much better. The choices of food options has definitely gone down. I didn't want to wait in the Roka Akor line, Sushi Roku had no sushi, Cian Agaves only had Chips & salsa/guac. The best option IN MY OPINION was Grimaldis, which was a steal, $2-3 a slice. Wow! I looked at the Spinatos pizza place and it looked worse than frozen pizza. The Garcias wasn't great. Next time I will just have to splurge on the $30 and JUST go to the beer garden. Loved the live music though!  Oh and I saw online the festival closed at 9 pm, but like all the tents and beer garden were empty and closed at 7 pm. I must have missed something.

Such a cute date night spot. my boyfriend and I went to dinner first then got here around 730pm (before the cover!) so we got a couch to sit on with some wine & listened to the band. Would recommend getting here earlier so you can get a table or couch, it gets really crowded closer to 8/9. Our original waitress forgot about us so we got a new one, only negative thing to say. Other then that, had a great time :)

Came here for the first time in ages & made me sad that I haven't been in a while, it was quite good. We had 8 of us + a baby & the service was great. The menu has changed since I last been in. All of our entrees & apps were very good. The ONE mishap we had was someone in the group ordered a "martini on the rocks" & it came back with no "rocks". And when we asked why it wasn't on the rocks, she said "yes it is". We later learned that she was new, and it was her first week on the job, so we told her rocks means ice :) Not a big deal though!!

Would I be judged if I said that Zipps is one of my favorite restaurant ever? And let me be clear, just the old town Scottsdale location -- Mill and Arcadia locations don't stand a chance. It helps that we live 2 miles away, so we ride our bikes & come after our coed softball games at Chaparral park. But any who, I just love it here. I get the wings with no sauce (dry rub) with Cajun seasoning & normally split the Bacon BBQ burger with my boyfriend, and the fries are awesome. Also, you can pretty much come anytime and there will be some sort of specials or happy hour. There are definitely a list of foods I have tried and do not recommend based --  I stay away from the salads or get the dressing on the side, the fish "tacos" are a nope, the mozzarella sticks are good but different (in a spring roll wrapper). But the pizza & burgers are definitely my go to. You just have to take in mind, the food is what you expect from a sports bar -- so like, you know what you're getting into when you come. But the drinks & drink specials are always great.. 32oz beer for $5?? And can't forget about the good ol Zipparitas (Chambord float). So if you are looking for a local divey type place to get drinks & have some good bar food, this is your place.

UPDATE: went last night & wasn't feeling too well so I asked what the soup of the day was.. they said Tomato Florentine & told me it was made in house. I got a sample and it was SO GOOD. My boyfriend & were shocked at how good it was. I got a bowl and wish I had more. Knowing that its fresh & they make it in house, I will definitely check out the soup of the day more often.

I love RA. Normally I wouldn't choose to go to a chain sushi place but RA is awesome. The Lobster Spring Rolls are amazing.. they used to be on HH back in the day, now they're around $11/12, ouch. But they come with 4 & great for the table. I am a pretty simple person when it comes to sushi - love the Philly roll (also not on HH) & the Tootsy Maki (is on HH). The HH is really good, and until 7 PM!  We came on a Saturday night around 8PM and it was pretty crowded. They told us 30 minutes so we went to the bar to get a drink but it really only ended up being like 10 minutes.  Our waiter (didn't catch his name) was super attentive & nice!  Love the patio!

LOVE Grimaldi's! We came for my boyfriend's birthday because when you sign up online for your bday you get a free large pizza, awesome perk! We got there around 6:30 on Friday night and they said the wait was 35 min so we sat at the bar and got a bottle of wine (Louis Martini cab) but the wait only ended up being like 15 min. We sat down in the dining room and its very loud in there, lots of families and kids, but no big deal. I just wouldn't recommend coming here for like a fancy date night. We started with the Mediterranean salad, a small is a perfect size for 2 or even 3 people, we didn't even finish it. Then we got a large pepperoni pizza and added meatballs. It was so delicious, & we ended up taking half home.

Came here 2 nights ago to celebrate my boyfriends new job & it was a perfect date night w/ amazing food & service. We had a 7:30 PM reservation, we checked in & they said it would be just a minute so we walked over to the bar to get a drink, as we were about to order, they called us over to be seated (so the wait time was less than 5 minutes). Our waiter (didn't catch his name) was great & very attentive. We both ordered cocktails -- I got a Raspberry Rosemary Cosmo & my he got a Dirty Goose Martini. Both were great. We split a Caesar salad, which was also very good & the perfect portions knowing we had a lot of food coming. For the Main Course -- I got the Surf & Turf special which was an 8oz filet with 2 lobster tails (YUM) & he got the Cowboy Ribeye. The two sides we got were the Potatoes Au Gratin & Crimini Mushrooms. Everything was delicious, if we came back I would get the same things again. We had a ton of leftovers, and no room for dessert :(

I've had nothing but good experiences here. I have always gone to the Toyota dealer with car help but when they quoted me around $1400 for new engine mounts, I knew I had to goget quotes elsewhere. A co-worker recommended First Class Auto, and they were very professional and were willing to help right from the start. After a free evaluation, they quoted me half the amount the dealer did. I went with them & my car was fixed quickly & they did a great job. I have taken my car there for anything that needs to be done since.

Honestly one of my favorite places in the world - love the beers & love the food.   Beers: Hop Knot. Kiltlifter. 8th Street. (depending on my mood, but those are my top 3).  Food: Oh lord, where do I begin....  Apps: Would STRONGLY recommend the wings (I always get them BBQ and grilled -- a little healthier), Nachos (they're huge but delicious) and the quesadillas. I would NOT recommend the thai lettuce wraps, I like spicy and these killed me & the carne asada tacos -- these were not as good as I thought they would be :/   Entrees: The burgers are pretty good but I love the beer bread sandwich's -- Italian beef is my favorite. Also, the French dip & new Yorker (a Reuben essentially) are delicious.   Most importantly... the special, Cheese Puffs. I have no words to describe because they're amazing. They have them on the 2nd Wednesday of every month. I have made it there for them every month for the last 5-6 months? One time I went around 6pm for dinner and they had run out (it was the same day they debuted Pumpkin Porter for the year) I was devastated so now I go around lunch time if I can.    Also, if you go to the Four Peaks website & scroll all the way down to the bottom you can sign up to receive their food specials twice a day (lunch & dinner). Game changer.  Anyways, I love Four Peaks! A must try if you haven't already :)

My boyfriend and I have a kegerator & we have yet to find anywhere near us in Scottsdale that has a good keg list & kegs to buy so Top's liquor is the best we have found. They are always so helpful & quick & the selection of kegs is huge.

Awesome Happy hour -- got the Polpette (meatballs) & they were AMAZING.. came with 3 large meatballs with some bread and lots of sauce for $6. Also, we got the gnocchi (Also $6), which I don't love gnocchi, & it was delicious.. the sauce on the two were different which made them even better in my opinion. The HH wine was only $4 and OK -- for that price, I'll drink whatever but wouldn't be too pleased if I paid full price for it.. but I'm sure its the house wine/chianti of some kind. My boyfriend and I then split the Capricciosa pizza, perfect size for us both (plus the 2 apps we shared). The pizza reminded me of something you would get in Italy & we both enjoyed it a lot. I would highly recommend it here, food is good, service is great, ambience is nice.

Came this week for happy hour with some girl friends & was impressed. The happy hour selection isn't bad at all - a few variety's of pizza, wings, and some other random items. I got the lettuce wraps to try to be a little *healthier* and they were sooo tasty ($7). They are placed in this delicious wonton type thing, I ate every bite. Also, wine was $2 off so mine went from $10 to $8, which is OK for happy hour, could have been a little better, but not a big deal.

Came here yesterday (Sunday at 1pm) for a friends birthday. I wasn't aware that the pizzeria doesn't open until 4PM so you have to kind of get up and do everything yourself -- go to the grocery to order your food and to the bar separately to get a drink. So, pretty casual during the day. I started with a white sangria and it was delicious, not very strong but fruity and refreshing. Had 3 orange slices in it & an apple slice & grape halve. Then because I wasn't too hungry I got the side cucumber salad & it was good -- cucumbers, avocado, tomatoes, olives, goat cheese I think?, and a side dressing & for only $3.50! Everyone else that I was with got the pizza & it looked amazing, next time I'm coming on an empty stomach to try it. I did have a quarter of the kids pizza & even that was good. Next time I come, it will be after 4PM so I can experience more of the restaurant part of it. Oh and its Arcadia so parking sucks, you pretty have to valet.

I love Sauce! Met a girlfriend after a workout class last night & it was actually my first time eating inside, normally my boyfriend and I get takeout. We got a caprese salad, pepperoni pizza, and a side of meatballs to split. The caprese salad was delicious and different than I expected it was a salad with lettuce with chunks of tomatoes, mozzarella, and pieces of bread, I would definitely get this again! Side note: the Caesar salad is really good too. I am a huge fan of the pizzas, they are thin crust, I've had a few different ones and enjoyed all of them, perfect to split between 2 people (~$8-10 per pizza). Its a nice place if you want to have a casual meal, you order at the front then they deliver your food to you (sort of like a pei wei or noddles& co).

One of my favorite brunch places in old town Scottsdale. The mimosas are perfect -- almost all champagne with a splash of OJ (just the way I like it). They also give you complimentary focaccia & pesto -- so good! My personal favorite brunch items are the Mediterranean salad w/ chicken ; the Gyro ; and the breakfast sandwich.   Side note: I only come here for brunch because once I came for dinner & was pretty disappointed.. got the sea bass (~$25) & it was not very good. instead of a whole piece of fish it was like little spears of it with very little flavor :/ if I did come for dinner again I would probably stick with a salad or flatbread.

Nordstrom Café is so underrated. When I've mentioned going here to friends that haven't been before, they're like "I'm not eating at a department store". But they have been missing out, the food is so fresh & tasty. I am not a salad person & I LOVE the Salmon Nicoise Salad ($11). It takes a few minutes for it to come out since the salmon is served hot on the salad, but so worth it. Also I always check out the soup of the day, they have tomato basil everyday which is delicious but I normally like to try the other one being served that day. Everything else I've had here has been good --pizza, sandwiches, etc. Strongly recommend when in need of a shopping break :)

I was so impressed with the sushi here! We came for happy hour at 530 PM on a weekday and I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in the restaurant the whole time we were there.  $5 house wine on HH, sushi was reasonably priced for HH which is 3-6 then at 6 there is half off sushi. So it seems like there's almost always a deal.  My friend and I were very satisfied with our sushi, I would definitely come back.

Ghengis is amazing! Used to come here all the time for lunch but then I switched jobs so this was the first time back in a while. One thing I noticed is that bowls seem to have gotten a little more expensive, $13 for a small bowl&  almost $15 for a big bowl. Crazy. But the concept is still great, love putting together your own bowl.

Only came here for drinks this past weekend after a bike ride but I would definitely give it another shot. Very small interior, with some chairs out front as well, but very "homey" inside, 2 small TV's, & LOTS of wall art/memorabilia. Prices for drinks aren't bad at all, beer was around $2-4 depending on what you got & wine was average $7-9 & they had a nice selection. The food that people were eating around us looked great so I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner sometime.

Needed a trim badly to get the split ends off and didn't want to pay $50 +tip to see my normal lady so I came here after work at 330 and they got me in right away. I passed on the shampoo and conditioner so they cut it dry but the lady did a great job & was very precise & thorough. The haircut was $16 & I found a coupon online for $2 off, so it was only $14 & I was out of there in 20 min!! Cant beat that for a trim.

I only came for drinks at HH so this review is NOT related to the food.   But this is a cool little spot. Far from my Scottsdale home but close to my far East Mesa office. Came with a co worker after work around 4PM & it was empty, one other couple at the bar, but people slowly started coming in. Almost EVERYTHING on the menu is on HH, its awesome, ALL sushi rolls & most drinks. The problem for me was some of the prices. Philadelphia roll, typically $5-7 elsewhere is $9.50 normal, $8.50 HH, pretttty steep to me. But I did not order sushi. Instead we each got a glass of house wine on happy hour for $5 & it was good. Bartender was very good :) I would like to come back for sushi just not pay some of those prices for basic rolls.

After last weekends sad trip to Singh Farms this was a major upgrade in my opinion -- an actual selection! We got there about 11AM (its open from 8-1) & boy was it crowded. We found a parking spot right down the block though. The only problem I had was they don't utilize the whole parking lot so the walkways are very narrow so people with strollers and large dogs sort of block the aisles, but we survived. The selection is great, everything from honeys, olive oils, pastas to cheeses, breads, meats & fish. It was awesome. The fresh produce area was great too. Next time I'm coming hungry so I can get a breakfast burrito at one of the local restaurants stands -- bootleggers & brat haus. Cant wait to go back.

Had a great time at my first Ramen Tuesday at Posh. Came with my boyfriend around 6PM & it was very empty, maybe one or two other couples & a few people at the bar. We were seated right away & the service was excellent the whole time. I didnt get a glass of wine because there were only 2 red choices  they were $12 & $13. My boyfriend & I both got the Shoyu Ramen & it was delicious! I could barely finish half it was so filling. $12 each, wasn't too bad. I would definitely come back again & try one of the other Ramen variations.   Also, people complained about parking on here but we had absolutely no problem, there were a bunch of spots reserved for Posh & we got one right up in front by the stairs. Possibly because it was a Tuesday at 6PM?

So obsessed with my lunch here today! I decided to be *healthy* and get a Greek salad but I cannot turn down gyro meat.. it was $10 total (no drink) for a pretty large portion, I didn't finish it all. The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned and delicious. The pita break on the side was hot and fresh & the tzatziki was delish. Will definitely come back.

So disappointed coming here this weekend. I was so excited, based on the pictures & reviews I read. My boyfriend & I rode our bikes here & first of all, we couldn't find anywhere to lock them up.. so after 10-15 minutes we found a tree/pole type thing on this little hill to lock them up &after battling some thorns. But that wasn't the worst part. We walk in & its a super cute wooded area but were looking around for produce & products to graze. And there was literally like a box or two of tomatoes, lemons, cabbage, a few other things. Then there was a little cabin type thing of honeys, vinegars, and at one point it looks like they had butter? So maybe because we came at noon they sell out early in the morning? They close at 2.. so maybe people just know to come early? So after doing a 5 min walk around, we were like okay lets get a juice at this juice bar they have, but there was at least 15 people in line in front of us.. ugh. so we left after 10 minutes max. We spent more time locking up our bikes then we did at the Farm. So the only reason I can think to come here is to let your kids play and run around, or just to sit by the fire pit and relax? Other than that, I cant think of any reason to come here, ill stick to the Scottsdale or DT Phoenix farmers markets if I actually want to buy some stuff & have some sort of a selection.  UPDATE: just looked at reviews below & saw : **TIP:  If you want to get the best veggie selection from the Farmer's Market get there EARLY.  By the time we got there 10:30am lots of the veggies were gone.** -- wish I would have read this before I went. Nothing left around Noon.

This Yogurtland is so much better then the one down the street from my house in Old Town Scottsdale. The flavors are so much better here, they have the staples, Red Velvet, Cake Batter, Cookies & Cream. Every time we go to the Scottsdale location they have the weirdest (in our opinion of course) flavors, no we don't want Strawberry Banana Taffy or Alphonso Mango Tart :-( and they had all the toppings there, Scottsdale tends to not have some of the regulars (Reese's... my favorite).  The only con of this location is that the two cashiers were chatting amongst themselves when there were empty topping containers, I had to ask them to fill them up.

My softball team & I frequent Zipps (next door) all the time on Wed nights, last night it was exceptionally crowded (maybe for Barrett Jackson/Phx Open?) so we went over to Clancy's. Clancy's was also super crowded but we snagged a table. Our waitress was super nice & attentive, everything came out pretty quick. We got a few pitchers of beer & some shots. I got a side of fries & potato skins and both were really good -- typical bar food, but what's not to like about that? Also, on Wed nights they have a burger special for $5. Someone in our group got it & it looked really good. I may have to get it next time. I felt weird cheating on my beloved Zipps, but Clancy's didn't disappoint.

One of my favorite restaurants/bars in Old town Scottsdale -- located right across the street from fashion square, great for people watching if you're sitting at the bar or on the patio. The bar is great because the bartenders are actual mixologists that know what they're doing & some of the drinks they make are crazy (ex: lighting things on fire). But, I'm boring & always get wine. Any who, the food is great, some of my favorites - the pretzels & cheese fondue is a must, culinary dropout staple. Then my other all-time favorite, turkey pastrami sandwich, to die for. Those two things are you wont be dissatisfied.

They re-did the outside bar area to high tops & its better than before! Perfect for a cocktail on the patio :) LOVE the deviled eggs "snack" on the meats/cheese menu. $3 for 3 , we got a double portion. Strongly recommend!

Came here last weekend for my boyfriends & his dad's birthdays & it was great! The ambience of the whole place was really nice, its tucked away in paradise valley, north of Camelback. I wish it was warmer outside so that we could have sat on the patio. We started with the raved about sticky buns, SO. GOOD. We got them as an app but I would recommend them for dessert :) but then again, I would eat them whenever, they were that good. Then for my main course, I got the salmon, my boyfriend and his dad split the Chateaubriand for two & his mom got the pork. Everyone was very satisfied with everything. I would definitely come back here. It is a little pricey so I would save it for a special occasion :)

Pretty far from home in old town Scottsdale but worth the trip out to Gilbert. The wait on Friday night at 730PM was 30-45 minutes which seemed a bit extreme for how big this place was. The margaritas were delicious & the food was awesome. I got the steak quesadilla, my boyfriend got the steak burro & our other two friends got a chicken burro. Big enough portions for 2 meals or to split with someone. Also reasonably prices, I think ours were $10-14 each.

Loveeeeee this theater! Once you start coming here it will be hard to go back to a Harkins ever again. The key is to join the FREE rewards program on their website so the prices go down a little. We went last night to see Star Wars & didn't get tickets early enough so we had to sit down at the lower level seats that don't recline :( they were OK, I wasn't nearly as comfortable as I wanted to be, but for that one movie, I will be ok. So make sure to get the recliner chairs up top, comes with free popcorn and water. I always get a glass of wine & my boyfriend a beer. They used to have drink specials on Tuesday but yesterday we found out that they no longer do that, boo.

Great park. parking is kind of frustrating, better off parking at one of the shops on Indian Bend & walking rather than waiting in the line to park for the stadium for $5. Good food choices & options!

I live in a house with 5 people & 2 dogs so we had Wave House come do a deep cleaning & the end result was great! A very reasonable price & the work was excellent, the house is spotless (for now.. because dogs.) We are going to continue using their services with the monthly visit.

We were downtown so figured we should stop by before we head back to our part of town. Normally the only time we get to Cooper Blues is before a comedy show, and just like those times, it was crowded. We got a seat before it got too crowded & the live band started. Our waitress was very nice, she messed up my drink order a few times but I will take some fault because I was being complicated :(. We got a few apps at our table -- chicken nachos, pretzels, and mac & cheese -- all super good! The nachos, like most places, were ginormous, and even 6 people couldn't finish them. Also, if you check in at yelp you get a free beer shot :)

I've been coming here for a while now, never making a reservation, just showing up, so getting waxed by a different person every time. I dropped in yesterday afternoon & lucky for me didn't have to wait. My waxer (I forget her name) was very nice, we had great conversations. But I've got to say, it was the most painful wax I think I have every had. She pulled the wax off soooooo slowwwww & then plucked so slow & I was almost in tears. I had to scrunch my face up until she was done to try to alleviate some of the pain. Then when I paid for it afterwards of course the front desk is so pushy to try and sell you stuff. And when I say no, this lady KEPT trying "but do you understand how much money you will save if you buy this package?" ... I don't care... I don't want it! So I think its about time I move on & find somewhere else. Bummer!

I feel a little weird giving a 5 star rating without trying the food but this is my type of place... the ambience, décor, service, wine selection, bar, etc. We came here last night after dinner for a glass of wine (we started at Grapevine across the street but ended up walking out right away to come here). We sat at the bar and it pretty crowded. The wine selection was good, we got a half bottle for $13, not bad! The food that everyone was eating around us looked amazing & I have heard the happy hour is great too. I will definitely be coming back very soon for a full dinner! Great for a date night.

Oh my gosh so good!! My boyfriend took me here for a late birthday dinner on Friday night & it met all my expectations & more. We had 730 PM reservations & we were seated right on time. We ordered a bottle of wine & split a Caesar salad, which was very good sized. I got the lamb chops with Brussel sprouts & potatoes & my boyfriend got the Bolognese pasta. It was all sooo good.   I cant remember our waiters name but he was so nice! I asked him if the anchovies are popular, because I've never had one and it just doesn't sound appetizing to me. And he brought me one to try. So nice. Will definitely come back!

Came here on Friday night after a Sun's game and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was really good & the food was great too -- I got the chicken quesadilla. Would definitely come back if I happen to be downtown.

My first time coming here on Friday night around 6PM & I will definitely be coming back! It was pretty crowded but yet I got seated and helped right away. I was very pleased with my pedicure & pricing wasn't too bad at all -- $23. Also a huge bonus for me is when they take tip on the credit card since I never carry cash.

Every time we're at Scottsdale Quarter, I walk by and say we need to try this place. Finally, this past weekend we went for my boyfriends birthday (which was hard to do since we love Mastro's City Hall and Ruths Chris). There is complimentary valet so we took advantage & got seated right away for our 7:30PM reservation. It was pretty hard to get to our table because there's almost no room in between tables, but no big deal. We got a bottle of the William Hill cabernet which was very reasonably priced (I think $33). The bread came in 3 options -- sea salt, garlic & cheese. We got the garlic and it was amazing, 5 huge rolls, but we only finished 2 & then took the rest home (would be great with some pasta Mmmm). Then for dinner we split the Caesar salad, I got the petit filet mignon (8oz), my boyfriend got a bone-in rib eye, and then we got 2 sides: sautéed mushrooms ; Dominick's potatoes which were like potatoes au gratin. All of it was AMAZING! The potatoes were so great, and we had leftovers of everything. I would definitely come back.

I was really disappointed with my experience here. I have always wanted to get a *blow out* and was nervous based on some reviews I read on here but gave it a try anyways, now I know to not do that again. I asked my stylist to just curl my hair, no fancy ringlets but just waves like a wand would produce. I was excited when they started curling the bottom, but then towards the top/front of my hair its like they rushed and did one big curl, ran their hands through it and was like "there you go!" and then I was like "ummmm", kind of in shock & realizing how bad it looked. And then they walked away. I then went home & re-curled all of it. So upset I paid $60 for it.

Always happy with my spray tan from here. Jess is friendly and quick -- in & out of there in 20 min. Always even color that lasts about a week for me. $26 if you pay in cash!

Really glad I joined Mountainside in addition to Fit Republic. The selection of cardio machines, circuit machines, & free weights are perfect, even during the most crowded times of the day. Still need to try a fitness class, but just the gym equipment is perfect.

Cool spot for some beers, especially if you like German beer! I was hoping there would be a bunch of people outside in the bier garden like I've seen in pictures and heard people talk about, but there wasn't a single person out there (maybe because it was pretty cold out for AZ). Instead, everyone was inside in the bru house, we sat at the bar & watched some football (they have 1 small TV in the corner) & drank a beer. I would come back, probably when the weathers better to sit outside in the bier garden area!

Tried this place for the first time the other day after always driving by and it was AMAZING! I got the Hatch burger (had a nice kick to it) with sweet potatoes & it was all delicious. The only complaints -- My friend had a margarita which was pretty sugary, couldn't really taste any tequila :/ and the service wasn't great, had to flag down a waitress a few times. So food-wise A+ ; service could use a little bit of improving.  If you like this place, check out Zinburger at Scottsdale Quarters, another one of my fav burger places around the valley.

It was our first time needing to buy pods since we bought our Nespresso Vertuoline & the experience was great. Tucked inside the Sur La Table at Kierland, the Nespresso *bar* has very helpful employees plus you get to enjoy a free cup of coffee while you're there. We bought a few new packs of pods & an employee registered our machine & we got a little keychain for easy check in next time. We will definitely come back to the store when we need to order again rather then order online.

In my experiences, airport food is never great &always overpriced, but I was very impressed with Blanco in Terminal 4. We stopped in to get carne asada breakfast burritos & I was not disappointed. Also, the bloody mary was delicious. The only downside is the price, but that's airport food for you!

The reason for the 2 stars is 100% the service. We had a group of 5-8 co workers (people came and left at different times) that got there around 430/5 PM after work on Friday and it wasn't even crowded yet for happy hour and the service was just awful. We had a server I think who's name was Michael (I could be wrong) and I felt like I constantly had to wave him down or go find him. One time when I was trying to order food I almost went up to the bar to order since he was no where to be found. Finally I made a comment to him about it & he seemed to show up a bit more. But based on other reviews on here, this seems to be a common problem. Frustrating.  Okay, now about the food. The happy hour is amazing, good selection & until 7PM, huge plus. Some of the apps are 1/2 off so around $4-5 each. I love the chicken quesadillas, bruschetta, chicken flatbread, calamari -- and I'm sure the rest is good too, but those are my go-to's.  So, if you don't mind waiting& having pretty bad service, the food is a reason to come!

Came here again after work with a group for the great happy hour and it was a much better experience than the last time we came. The service was 100% better, the waitresses that helped our group were extremely attentive & everything came out quickly. Very impressed!

Came here last night for happy hour and discovered a new gem... $5 burgers on Tuesdays. And not a tiny, happy hour size burger, like their full menu size, normally $10-12, burgers. So. GOOD! I strongly recommend to anyone that is hungry for a big meal & craving a burger on Tuesdays. Pairs great with $4 wine and beer for happy hour :-)

Love Cowboy Ciao & the airport location does not disappoint. I was bummed that we came in the morning so I couldn't get the Stetson salad (well maybe you can order it but I felt like I needed to order actual breakfast). I got the simple breakfast (thats my name for it, i forget what its actually called) -- eggs, bacon, potatoes, and an English muffin & it was delicious. Exactly what I wanted. My boyfriend got the breakfast enchiladas & they were also to die for. Our serve, TJ i think, was awesome. Super satisfied. Excited to go back.

I love Chop Shop -- healthy, tasty, and cheaper then some other the others (ie Flower Child). I am not a salad person at all, there are very few places I would order one, but the beet salad with chicken has won my heart over! Also if I'm not in the salad mood, the protein bowls are really good too. The only downside I would say is that parking can be rough, but that's old town Scottsdale for you.

My previous comment *mysteriously* got deleted so I thought I would summarize here. DO NOT COME HERE. I know that I am a young woman and its easy to be taken advantage of when it comes to cars, but these people are on another level. I came in because my car was shaking when driving/ I thought the tires felt weird. They told me my car was messed up from a rock getting inside it and messing up the engine and all this stuff, & how I would be in danger to drive it, &the cost would be over $1000 to fix it. I FREAKED OUT and took it to the dealer right away, they took it for a few hours, checked everything & they said absolutely nothing was wrong with it. Oh wait, maybe my tires were slightly out of alignment. But nothing with the engine/under the hood. Ridiculous!

I've had nothing but good experiences with Smiles Chandler. Janessa at the front desk is so sweet & helpful. The dental hygienists & dentists do a great & thorough job. I always leave with clean, happy teeth. I would strongly recommend to anyone needing a dentist  -- I travel almost 20 miles to come here & its worth it.

I used to work right down the street from this place so it was a perfect lunch spot. The beers were okay/not bad -- when I got the sampler I would like maybe half of them, the IPA's were my favorite. But the food is DELICIOUS. Definitely do NOT come here if you are dieting (although I did try one of the salads and it was pretty good). But the pulled pork sandwich is my absolute favorite, paired with the fries of course (and I am such a Fry girl). Also, the loaded fries are amazing, 'Merica Fries. They're delicious and will fill you up. The one thing I would strongly NOT recommend is the Beet and Apple Salad, its a side, and the most horrible taste, the horseradish dressing and blue cheese is overwhelming. Also, make sure to come during Taco Tuesday, I've loved all the tacos that I have tried there as well :) Ambiance is great, although I think they only have 1 tv so I wouldn't recommend coming during a game.

Came here yesterday at 11:30AM & there was not a single car in the parking lot.. so we walked up and saw another couple walking away.. odd. They open at 11am so we weren't sure what the problem was. The manager came out and said they weren't supposed to be open today on Super Bowl Sunday & had a little mix up but if we hung out for a few, everything will be up and running soon. So we had some beer and apps & the waitresses (we had like 2 or 3 in the course of the 3 hours we were there) were very attentive & helpful. The beer we had was so good, we ended up getting a growler of Tropical Storm to go. YUM! All small businesses have some operational issues at some point so no big deal, but the service was great & the food and beer is good as always :)

I rarely go to McDonalds but occasionally I get the craving for a filet o fish sandwich (weird, I know). The past 2 times I have gone through the drive thru at this location I say "filet o fish with NO cheese please". I get to the window they hand me my meal with the sandwich and a sticker on it saying "w/o cheese".. so they acknowledge it, but then it always has cheese on it, so I cannot eat it. I guess its just a reason why I shouldn't be going to McDonalds in the first place.

Sloan Park is definitely one of my favorite spring training parks (and not just because I love my cubbies). The cubs moving from Hohokam was one of the best things ever because that stadium is a dump. Anywho, the parking is kind of a cluster so we always uber from Scottsdale since its pretty centrally located on the Tempe/Mesa line. But the seats are all great, food is good, lawn is awesome. No complaints from me. Pricing isn't great -- go during the week or buy your tickets early!

Best BBQ ever, or at least in AZ. Got here at 10:35, waited in line almost 2 hours, got our food around 12:15 but worth it. They passed out a few samples while we were in line & passed out free water bottles. What makes the line so slow is when they open at 11AM people order large amounts for people not there or big group orders. So you may only see a few people in front of you but chances are some of them are ordering a lotttttt of food.  Anyways, on to the food. I got the 2 meat plate with lean brisket & pulled pork. They come with 2 sides so I got the jalapeno cheddar grits and the baked beans. All of it was AMAZING. We actually took half of ours home for leftovers. The BBQ sauces on the table are great too, make sure you grab some to go. Two 2-meat plates & 1 soda = $39 ; I think the meals are $16ish each  Would definitely come back when I'm in the mood to wait in 2 hour long line. My advice would be to get there early like 9:30-10AM so at least you're one of the first people when they open at 11 AM and don't have to wait for all of the people with large orders.

I miss the Darque Tan days -- I have never really been satisfied with PBT. Came in last night for a spray tan & there's one lady working & she was helping a couple. She was nice & said to me "be with you in a second" but that second was 15-20 minutes. How is she the only one checking people in, making sales, and cleaning the beds & showing guests how to use them? Ugh. Then the fact that one spray tan is minimum $40-50 for a MACHINE to tan you is insane, you can go down the street to the Bronze Bar and get a custom spray tan by a PERSON for $26. Craziness. But I came because it was last minute and couldn't get an appt at Bronze Bar. But, I bought one (actually 3 because it was cheaper). Anywho, I haven't used the VersaPro since November, and either it changed or something was messed up. They didn't do the second drying cycle for the front & back after each spray segment. I asked the lady at the front desk and she said I dunno. Sooo I left pretty sticky. Welp, pretty bummed about my experience but it is what it is.

Update: I knew I had to come back because it was cheaper for me to buy 3 spray tans than 1. I used both tans recently and I've noticed the quality of the tan has gone down significantly. I get the darkest shade you can go & barely feel tan the next day. My boyfriend doesn't even notice like he used to. Also the VersoPro seems to have been downgraded where they don't do the pre-spray anymore & the drying amounts have changed. If I would have known that the first time I would have been less confused. But they told me the second time I went in.   You're better off going to a custom tan place for way less & for a longer lasting, better quality spray tan. I recommend the Bronze Bar in Old Town Scottsdale -- huge fan.  Lastly, I received a comment on my review from 2/24 from Penelope M. of Palm Beach Tan asking for more information about my poor experience. I responded by email on 3/7 & never heard anything back.

Came here on Friday night with another couple to celebrate my boyfriends birthday & we had a great time. Had 730PM reservations & were seated right away. My girlfriend and I split a bottle of wine -- Argentina Malbec, really good. And our boyfriends got beer. I was interested in the Pacific Redfish on the menu but was bummed when they were out of it so I settled for Mesquite Salmon -- it was great! My boyfriend got short ribs which were delicious too. We also split a side of the mac & cheese -- very good. We all had a great time here & would definitely come back!

I am a HUGE lover of Zipps.. my bf & I, as well as my softball team, frequent the miller & camelback (old town Scottsdale) location at least once a week (normally like 2 times/week) & I have zero complaints.. this one on the other hand, oh my gosh. Where do I start:  We came this weekend, yes during the Tempe Arts Fest, but I was surprised at how not crowded it was, I have seen this place packed before for big games,.. but not this day, easy to get a table. So we find a table no problem, but it hasn't been cleaned yet, dirty plates and napkins on it, no big deal, but 10-15 minutes go by and no one has come by. Finally we stop a waitress and she apologizes and takes our order. We asked for two waters and a pitcher of Ranger. A few minutes later a lady comes with one 32 oz beer, nope we ordered a pitcher. Okay no big deal again..  and then the pitcher comes. Then we see her 10 minutes later and I ask for waters again, still nothing. Finally I was so thirsty I went up to the bar to order a water. Then we decided the slowness is crazy so we get the bill since we had to catch the light rail to Chase Field. We get the check & she didn't charge us the correct price for the pitcher, $15 instead of $10 (HH).. oh and that's all we got so its not like it was too challenging. So my bf goes and tells her the price is incorrect. Then I get the check back, and she ran my card for $25.. I'm guessing the $10 + $15? I was like oh my goshhhh how can this lady be SO bad at her job???? Like at least can someone tell us she's new or something?Then I would be way more understanding. But it was unreal, one error after another after another.

Last night around 7PM my boyfriend and I were on our way to El Hefe for Taco Tuesday but decided to try something new & go here (of course I had anxiety because I didn't have time to check the Yelp reviews first LOL). We sat at the bar and there was like one other person in there besides us, so I was kind of worried. HH was still going on so I got a glass of wine for $5, it was nice big pour, & I spotted that it was one of my favorites -- Velvet Devil (which in stores is around $15) so this was a great deal for a bar. The boyfriend got a $5 HH margarita which was good, a little too strong for me, but I'm sure most people would love the fact that it was that strong. The Taco Tuesday special is for $2 ea you can get carne asada ; chicken ; barbacoa. So we got some of each & they were all really good & big for street tacos! A lot of stuffing, and even a big dab of guac, I was impressed. I would definitely come back here.

Such a fun place!! I am not an avid golfer but this place is awesome, especially with a group of people to golf, eat & drink. We came this Sunday at 10AM for brunch with 6 people & it wasn't crowded at all, service was good, beers were $3 ea, & we got the queso which was yummy. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is it is a bit pricey per hour of golfing, it can get up to $45/hour depending on when you go. That's why I always go with a group so you can split it a few ways.

came here last night before seeing a movie & I just love it! we made it for HH (ends at 6) where all wine -- glasses & bottles are 1/2 off. the newton cab/merlot is 10glass/40 bottle & we were splitting it between 2 people so we went with the bottle for $20. cant beat that! then during HH all apps/side are half off.. so we got the zucchini fries & truffle fries). the zucchini fries are amazing -- breaded perfectly. I made my own burger (which is best to do during HH because the base burger before add ons is $7 rather than $9.50) , but they do have some good combos on the menu. The burgers are perfect size 7 so tasty!!! I would highly recommend!

Love Fit Republic, definitely worth the price. I used to go to a barre studio for $165/mo for a 6 month contract to take the exact same class over & over. Now I pay way less to take a variety of classes at Fit! My favorites are cycle, yoga, & barre. Strongly recommend :)

The star rating is 100% the food because the service SUCKED.  My friend & I met after work for HH at 5PM & got a nice spot on the patio, it was PACKED! We ordered a few glasses of wine, edamame (HH menu), Buffalo wings (HH menu), and then we each ended up getting a Hot Chick Sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. Food was excellent as always. Strongly recommend the sandwich, delicious.   Service was another story. My friend & I had a lot of catching up to do so we were there for a few hours (like 3) but I swear we only saw our waitress 3-4 times total. We actually had to wave her down a few times to order an entrée and get another glass of wine. I was disappointed.  Also, I have gotten the Pad Thai before, and although its good it was very soupy. All the liquid/sauce in it sat at the bottom. Just felt different and weird to me.

I normally only come here on their board & bottle nights -- $20 after 8PM, BUT I had some friends in town & met them here on Fri night & it was just as crowded & delicious :) the wine is really good, we always get Notebook. And then the best thing on the menu is of course the bruschetta, all of them are really good.. haven't had one I don't like yet (my favorite though is Warm Artichoke Spread). Normally the bruschetta fills me up because the board itself is huge but the salads are & sandwiches are good as well. Highly recommend it here :) Also, nice ambiance, great patio!

Came here for a work happy hour & it was a cool place. There were a bunch of apps on the table when I arrived -- the fried zucchini was so good & same with the potato skins. The wings looked good but I didn't have any. Perfect if you're craving that salty, fried bar food & want to watch a game on TV, there are a bunch of TV's around the restaurant. I had a tall 22oz beer on draft and it was only $5, not sure if that's happy hour or normal pricing. We came on a Wednesday around 4pm and it was pretty dead, probably beat the dinner crowd and there weren't really any sporting events on. I would come back.

Came here on Saturday for lunch for the first time because we wanted tacos & we were not disappointed. We both wanted a margarita & the waitress suggested a pitcher of the house marg which we later calculated to be the better deal (one glass = $7 ; we got 2.5 glasses EACH out of the pitcher and it was only $24 -- saved $11!!). The margarita was delicious! Then my boyfriend got 2 charred skirt steak tacos & I got one skirt steak & one crispy cod. They were SO good. I would DEFINITLY come back.

I did not realize how expensive new bikes were until I started looking around at local shops, $400+ :( couldn't do it.. so I came here which was full of used bikes & my boyfriend & I both found ones we love! I found a slightly used bike for $60 & the boyfriend found an awesome one too. The employees were SO helpful & nice, pumped our wheels up and checked everything before we left. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a bike & doesn't want to pay for a brand new one.

Cool brewery with good food & beers. We came on Sat around 2pm and it was pretty crowded. We got a beer flight & overall the beers were pretty good, some better than others. We then split the smothered fries with beer cheese & the tots. Both DELICIOUS! I loveeeeeeed the fries so much I had to force myself to stop eating them.

Love this place! Sunday brunch is definitely a happenin' place, people drinking & loud music. Came here with 9 people on Sunday around 12:30 before a Giants spring training game & it was pretty packed but not too bad. We got two bottles of champagne (not the real stuff) for $40 each & it comes with some juices -- orange, grapefruit, mango. My boyfriend & I split the burrata and deviled eggs appetizers -- total being $17, not bad. I have gotten the Lobster Roll before which I loveeeeeee but its hard for me to justify spending $20 on the lil thing.

Came here for happy hour on Friday around 530/6 PM. The bartender was super nice & let me sample 2 of the beers. We got the nachos for $7 (+ $3 for added chicken) so $10 for nachos at happy hour.. I don't think this is a very good deal. & they were no where nearly as big as nachos elsewhere..But the chicken on it was pretty good. For a comparison: When I go to Zipps for happy hour nachos are $5. Also the place had a weird smell to it.. Like spilled/old alcohol from the night before. I probably would not come back here. Also, its very tiny, but is in a great location.

We came here before going to the movies on Fri night. Happy hour is until 6 & a really good deal. House wine is $4 & beers are $4.75. My boyfriend & I split: -Caesar Salad ($3.95) - my boyfriend said it was pretty good but he tried my kale salad and wish he had gotten that -Kale Salad ($4.95) - delicious!!! and perfect amount for a side salad -Pulled Pork Sliders ($4.95) - really good -Hand Cut Pub Fries ($3.95) - good! -Pepperoni & Four Cheese Pizza ($4.95) - personal size, perfect for splitting since we got all of the other stuff too. but normally I would say its too small to split.  Also, I've had the sushi before (California roll-- on HH menu) -- its really good! And I normally don't get sushi just anywhere :)

So good!!! My friend from out of town looked up this place & I was pretty excited to try somewhere new. Our waitress Maya was amazing, gave great recommendations & the service was fantastic. We started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer, oh my gosh, it was delicious. The bruschetta was good too but the Brussel sprouts just blew everything out of the water. I got the Burrata appetizer as my meal, the cheese was so fresh and delicious. My boyfriend got the tri tip French dip it was delicious as well. And the flatbread our friends got was also amazing. No complaints at all about this place. Will definitely be back!

Came here only for drinks but I will definitely come back for food some time. My boyfriend & I walked by here on Friday night around 7PM & decided to check it out. Right when we walked in the owner greeted us and asked how he could help us, we said we were thinking about a glass of wine. He gave us a sample of the wine from the tap & we liked it so we stayed for 2 (only $4 during HH!). The red was a little more chilled then I would like it, not sure if that's normal coming from the tap or not. The inside is very open & there's a cute little patio. Staff is very friendly. Looking forward to coming back for food soon!

Dr. Walter & her team are great. They were running a bit behind schedule & I told them I was in a hurry, so the front desk lady, the Dr assistant & Dr. Walter all made sure I got in as quickly as possible. Yet, Dr. Walter didn't hurry through my appointment and still answered all my questions & explained everything thoroughly to me. Strongly recommend!

Went on  bike ride yesterday to Old town Scottsdale with the intention of just going to Brat Haus (which is next door), but then we saw Goldwater Brewing and decided to check it out. Its pretty small inside but there's still plenty of room at the bar & some tall bar tables with a garage door open for fresh air. Also, there's an outside area with tables and chairs but it was pretty chilly (for AZ) yesterday so everyone was inside. The lady behind the bar was very friendly & gave us samples of a few beers to try. I like pale ale's so I tried Ayeyou & Dynamite. I liked Dynamite a lot more, a really good pale ale. My boyfriend likes IPA's so he tried What A Day and Birthday Suit, he went with Birthday Suit. Then when we looked around we noticed everyone had a pink colored beer, so we felt like we needed to try it. It was called Desert Rose, a cactus ale, it was pretty good & not as fruity as it looked (it was bright pink). They did not have any food to order but I saw people bring food from outside places in & there was a popcorn machine for a light snack. The bartender told us the owners were a father & son who have a passion for home brewing and have been brewing for 20 years!! They finally opening up this shop in May of this year. I didn't ask her how its been doing overall but by the looks of the crowd yesterday I could imagine its doing pretty good. Any who, I would definitely come back!   Side note: there are no TV's so don't come to watch a game.

LOVE! I've been meaning to go here since I drove by one time so finally my boyfriend & I rode our bikes here & it did not disappoint. The patio was super cute & there were a bunch of people on it (I saw some corn hole too). We sat inside which wasn't as crowded (it was a really nice day out). We got a flight of 6 beers & then got one other - my rankings from favorite to least favorite: 1 ) American Pale Ale (I'm a pale ale girl!) 2) The Thames They Are A Changing  3) S.P.A. 2.0  4) Fate-Ality! IPA  5) Red Hop  6) Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale  7) Hatch Chile Cream Ale (pretty good but couldn't drink a lot of it) We also got the spinach dip -- SO good. Service was great. Would definitely come back!

Such a great time here! We had a group of 6 that all bought Groupons for $27 per couple, when normally I think its that much for one person? Anyways, we got there 15 min before, put our stuff in lockers, & explained the rules. We ended up escaping with 2 minutes to spare. EK! Nerve racking!! Would do it again for sure!

Awesome workout! I have been to 3 classes now & I'm hooked! The screen in the front of class displays "standings" on how you compare to others in the class & its super motivating & competitive. They also throw in an arm workout. Great class if you want to challenge yourself :-)

Such a good replacement of the old Harkins... I'm a huge fan of luxury movie theaters so I may be biased. Normally we go to iPic but I think we found our new theater (which is also so much closer to home). Tickets are pretty pricey ($15 ea when ordering online) but you do get to reserve your seats, which makes it easier. Also in the lobby area there's a bar, an outside patio area, and normally movie theater concessions. And yes you can bring the drinks into the theater, wooo! The theater was really nice, big comfy seats that reclined. I will definitely be coming back here!!  Also: they were passing out SAMPLES of cookies & desserts. All the desserts are from LGO, love love love.

This place is adorable. My bf and I came after dinner on Friday night around 9PM and it was the perfect amount of people. Very tiny inside but wasn't packed, and still some open spots at the bar. There was a tv at the bar so I was able to watch my cubbies (lose, boo). And the beer & wine selection was good. I think there was around 15 beers on tap? Maybe a few more. Oh and the bathroom was very clean, which was shocking for there only being one (no offense men).  The only mishap was that the credit card machine stopped working when we were ready to go. So we had to wait 10-15 minutes until someone came to fix it.

I wasn't sure what to expect at this event but I was very impressed! So many vendors & fun lil things to do (photo booth!). My group got there around 530/6 & it wasn't too crowded, I think we beat a bunch of the after work people. Got to try most of the beer & wine samples & had some good conversations with the people working them, not to mention coming home with tons of *swag* - shirts, koozies, sunglasses, pens, etc. We tried one of the pizza trucks (cant remember which one) and it was DELICIOUS. And lastly, we stopped by the W after party& had a few good drinks there& danced a little. Fun night :-)

Came here for lunch at 1130 today and the line as out the door. They had samples while you're waiting in line which was nice. The soups don't have a description of what they are so I asked the cashier what the "Irish stew" was. She said she didn't know. So obviously I didn't get it but that's sort of weird she didn't know what it was like. I got a 1/2 soup and 1/2 salad. The soup (chicken noodle) was good, salad (chicken chop subbed a vinaigrette for the blue cheese that came with it) it was okay, very basic.. nothing special. Although the bread & croutons that come with it were great, so fresh & delicious! They have some bread on sample too. Also, the selection of pastries, breads and desserts (cakes, pies, cupcakes, everything) is pretty impressive. I would definitely come back, just hoping the crowds die down a little :)

This place definitely exceeded my expectations. We came at 630 on Thursday and it was packed. We sat inside where it wasn't too crowded (everyone seemed to be on the patio) and there were lots of TV's which is awesome. The menu is huge, & there's tons of options. I got a glass of wine, a bowl of the chili and a shrimp taco. Both were delicious and spicy, especially the chili. My boyfriend got one of their own Social tap beers & said it was great and also tacos (mix & match). Really pleased with everything and we will be back for sure.

Love!!!!! First of all, I am a huge Postino fan -- Arcadia, Tempe, Phx...wherever! I love the food & atmosphere & wine of course. I love the layout, very open & the walls are covered in matchbooks, very cool. The service was great & everything came out as expected, delicious!!! I will definitely be back soon!

Came here on Sunday morning to try one of the free classes with Holly & it was amazing!!! Talk about a killer workout. I take 2-3 cycle classes a week at my gym and this didn't even compare. The stats on the screens were super motivating and made me push even harder. Also the weighted bar part of class was challenging but great. I will definitely be coming back here to get my butt kicked again!.

Love CycleBar! Had a great experience at the McCormick Ranch location & this Chandler location is the exact same! The stats on the screen are extremely motivating & great for all the competitive people out there. The music & class instructor were great. I also love the arms portion of the class, so exhausting! I cant wait to come back :-)
