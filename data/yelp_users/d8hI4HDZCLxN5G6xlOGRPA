I took my car there when i had a flat tire. They found a nail in it and replaced it. Great prices on tires.  Another time i thought i had another flat and took it there to get checked. They checked and told me my tires were fine and they refilled my tires. But they had not! I went home and check the pressures and it was as low as 25 psi. Not sure i will trust them again!

This is the best pizza in Phoenix. No 2 hour wait like Bianco and good service. Great Ambiance. Must try the Italian soda :-)

I had a dinner buffet here this week. It was one of the best Indian buffets I have had in the US. There was an excellent variety of both Veg and Non Veg food including desserts. Food tasted great! Garlic Naan served hot at the table is great. Serving Tandoori chicken on a sizzler plate at the table is a master stroke. The Gulab Jamun was fantastic - hot and fresh. All this for 9.95$. I am going again this weekend.

My friends and I went to this place for a Sunday buffet.  The food was tasty and place was clean. But, like all Indian food, i judge the food on how i feel later in the day or day after. I felt there was a stone in my stomach. Had so much trouble and had a bad stomach upset. So did  my friends. This place seems to add too much basking soda in the food.  Would recommend against it. Won't go there either.
