I'm not a big fan of chains, however I made an exception for IHOP and I was pleasantly surprised. The server on St. Patrick's day was great. She let me order off the kids menu and I was very grateful. The food was normal quality chain food, but it hit the spot.

The food is tasty, reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is nice. The problem is that the establishment is inundated with hipsters. I think Lux drives them to Pane Bianco.

Change your name. I went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable. It's not even a cheese shop. If your interested in purchasing cheese go to Duck & Decanter, Wedge and Bottle, or AJ's.

Sunup is the best brewery no one knows about. It's been there forever but we all just drive by not even noticing it. I go about once every 2 weeks. The beer is good the seasonal beer is amazing. But I don't go for the beer or the food, I go for the staff. The servers and bartenders are genuinely friendly. I know that one of the bartenders, Emily, recycles all the bottles.     I recommend ordering the wings and a seasonal beer. Sit at the bar and chat up January or Emily. I don't think you'll regret it... I almost forgot Mollie is awesome.

The best kept secret of the Bethany home 16 th St intersection. The food is always quality and super inexpensive, the drinks are stiff and well made. The atmosphere could be spruced up but then it wouldn't be cjs anymore. I go often and regularly. The crowd changes at around 9pm and gets younger and more interesting. Worth a visit.

Simply the best Groomers in town! I was hesitant at first, because I love my dog and have trust issues. In the end I'm so happy I trusted puff and fluff. I almost didn't recognize fluffy. He was so clean and soft. They don't have a sign but they're behind Starbucks next to the swizzle. I like shopping local and this place screams locally owned. The staff was attentive, quick, and attractive. I can't say enough good things about this place.   SERIOUSLY AMAZING DOG GROOMING

The cheese selection is very large and reasonably priced for the kinds of cheese available. That is not to say that duck and decanter is cheap. I prefer the staff at the north central location over this location. Duck and Decanter almost has a monopoly on unique cheeses, coffees, teas, etcs. The only other real option is AJ's and the prices there are exorbitant.

I've been looking for a local barbershop or salon to go to regularly, and I tried a few before nadia. I was a walk in, she had other customers with appointments but she found time to fit me in. She did an amazing job. I've received multiple compliments in only a few days. I've noticed her clientele seems to be men. I'd recommend her to anyone.

The only dive bar in phoenix that truly reminds me of my midwestern roots. Cheap drinks, great happy hour(that's ridiculously long and cheap). You'd think that this would attract the less than desirable crowd to frequent swizzle, but I've only found great bartenders and patrons at this little bar. If you're in the neighborhood you've got to give them a try.

Armadillo grill is awsome. There is no simpler way of putting it. The food is always tasty, everything on the menu is good. I generally get the grilled cheese and tomato soup, because their tomato soup is the best I've ever eaten. The bartenders and servers are always nice and efficient. It's never been so busy that I couldn't get a seat, but there is always people there. It's everything I want in a neighborhood bar. Thank you armadillo keep up the great work.

What's not to love about an upscale Walmart for the upper middle class? This store isn't as busy as some of the others and there always tends to be less unsightly people shopping at this store than the others. Parking is generally easy and the cash registers move fairly fast. I also like that Sam's club allows business owners to come in early to avoid the crowds.

Damn Fine breakfast establishment. After suffering a horrible wait and no food episode at Matt's big breakfast. I drove by Lo Lo's and decided to give em a try. I am so happy I did. I got the coffee and the breakfast sandwich and I'm happy to say I was sat at a table promptly, my coffee was fresh and great, and my sandwich was heaven on earth. It was similar pricing to Matt's and everything was good start to finish. I will return to Lo Lo's for breakfast in the future.

Ahhh, how I thought I would be disappointed reading reviews before going to Biancos, but I was anything but disappointed. The reviews suggested that some select people did not think it was special. Those people are wrong. I had a perfect lunch the wise guy pizza was, as billy crystal world say "marvelous". My glass of reisling was delightful. The seats at the bar left my bum hurting a bit, but no pain no gain. I will definitely return.

Durant's Ohhhhh how I love thee, from your meat puppets to your prime rib. I can always count on your cooked to perfection food, stellar service, and stiff drinks. If only more were as great as you. I would have to say that DURANTS is the one restaurant that any visitor NEEDS to eat at to experience Phoenix.  Putting my love and affection aside, please check your slider buns before service mine were a bit stiff tonight, not bad just not up to the level of amazingness I'm accustomed to.

Best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix. Hands down the best upscale Mexican food establishment here. It's a little pricey for Mexican food, but it is upscale. To be honest I used to think that all Mexican food was some combination of the same ingredients over and over again, but Barrio proves that there are other good quality Mexican dishes. Keep doing what your doing Barrio, I will return.

Other than the place being a little dirty I would have to say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in phoenix. The desserts are to die for. The margaritas are stiff and tantalizing. I think they are going for a bit of grunge look, I'm just not into that style. I would return.

The single handed worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The only time I've ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up. I came alone on a Saturday at 9am. I asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess(I guess you could call her that) stated that, "they don't quote times, but that it goes fast." They don't write down the time you arrive so either management doesn't care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it. I find it rude, disrespectful, and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other. They must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become "pot committed" and hang out for the table.      Maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better. I've eaten at Matt's Big Breakfast before and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality. They aren't spectacular just good. Sadly Phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints.      So starving after a 50 minute wait I decided to head home and stop at McDonalds (also a one star restaurant, but at least I won't wait 50 minutes to get to place my order). While en route I drove by LO LO'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES approx. 2 miles from Matt's big (slow) breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am. I pulled in to Lo Lo's and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast. How about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best. I was immediately sat at a table(there was enough space for 8 person parties. Coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I was dumbfounded why I tried to go back to Matt's Big (slow) breakfast with so many other options available.     Two additional points I'd like to make: first, there was a bunch of people waiting for Matt's Big (slow) Breakfast but it wasn't a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50+minutes; second, YOU'VE been warned.     If you want to try something different/unique/and worthwhile give LO LO's Chicken and Waffles a shot at breakfast. I don't mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant. What I mind is a restaurant that doesn't value it's patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not.

The best Greek food in Phoenix, the price was reasonable. The family owned staff was great. The wine suggested by the server was very good. My only issue was that the table clothes on the tables were kind of dirty. They should charge an extra 50cents per plate and change the table clothes after every table leaves. Cleanliness is next to godliness. I wanted to give 5 stars but the cleanliness factor held me back.

Dick's hideaway is one of my favorite restaurants in the phoenix area. I went there for breakfast and wasn't disappointed. They suggested the meatloaf(that's right for breakfast) and I must say it was good. It was hard getting over the concept of meatloaf for breakfast so I wouldn't order it again, but it was worth the experience. The coffee was good and fresh and the service was up to the task. The price however was a bit high for breakfast after tip and coffee it came to 20 dollars for one person. For lunch or dinner that's fine, but not for breakfast. Granted there was enough food; that had I been joined by a comrade we could have easily split.

I liked this place, the food was good and different. My beer was up to par and the happy hour was nice. The problem was that the place was a bit sterile, "not inviting". I think they need to add some color to the atmosphere. Also it was a bit of an old crowd for me, but I am in my 20's.

High priced DOG food. The boneless chicken wings were barely edible and made my stomach gargle for hours. This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees. Management: Stop offering discount wings during happy hour, your staff gets rude to people who order them because they believe they aren't going to get a descent tip, your not helping yourself.

I like the express lanes they have for those of us that no how to use a touch screen, but these stores always feel really large. The lunch meat slicers are closed by 9pm, not cool. I do like the discounted steaks, but I wish they had more readily available and seperated from the more pricey stuff.

I ordered the lamb kabobs and the shishk kabobs. I also ordered the lemonade. The kabobs were edible but entirely devoid of flavor, the lamb was better than the shishk. The rice that came with it as well as the salad was very good, flavorful. For food I would give them 3 stars, but the lemonade was worth 5 stars. Thus the 4 star rating. The atmosphere was meh. The lemonade is what it's all about.

They burned the espresso beans in my cappuccino. It's a coffee shop right? They should make good coffee and espresso drinks. If you can't do a cappuccino right you have no business being in the coffee business. In addition, it took forever to get my bagel and cream cheese(over 15min). A wednesday at 10am is hardly an overly busy time. Am I wrong to expect prompt efficient and quality service from a coffee house. I had three sips of the cappuccino and pitched it. The bagel was fine, but its not as though they are baking them in the back. Save your money and go to lux or even starbucks for that matter.

It is well worth returning solely for that dish. The atmosphere is great, the service was par, the price was reasonable. I would recommend this establishment to others and I will return.(for the pork tenderloin)

Sidebar is a great little bar tucked away on the 2nd floor of the pei wei building at the corner of 7th ave and McDowell. The drinks are generally good especially when made by the owner. I really like the "Mexican" Mondays when they offer free food and discount margaritas. The only problem and sole reason for the 4 star over 5 star review is the parking is terrible, but what can you expect for a place that is basically downtown.

ONLY GO DURING HAPPY HOUR. The prices for sushi when it's not happy hour are wayyyyy to high. I've been to Moira twice, once during happy hour and once with "sad hour" as I call it. Happy hour was fun and priced well while "sad hour" was depressingly expensive. Service was good both times, the atmosphere nice and hip, and the rolls are pretty tasty.  2 dollar warm sake during happy hour, what, what!!

Slow service in the bar when there was no other patrons.

No chicken at kfc. Seriously at 9pm on a weekday I pulled up to the drive-thru and was presented with a mumbling unintelligible female voice stating that they were, "out of chicken, but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes they would make some more." I responded all chicken? Your out of all chicken? To which she responded, "yeah." Wow, what an experience a KFC with no Chicken.

Although different than the traditional coffee shop, cartel, is arguably the best coffee shop downtown. They take more time making each cup, and thus the quality is increased but the wait is also increased. I would wager that as cartel grows in popularity the wait will become unbearable, much like Matt's big (slow) breakfast.

I've been here a few times and the food is always tasty, I like the atmosphere, and the service is always above and beyond. The big problem I didn't even notice until my wife pointed it out. Every guest inside the restaurant on a Friday night at 7pm was over the age of 40 (besides my wife and I). If you want a trendy place to go this isn't it, but if you're interested in terrific food try Beckett's.

Oh the humanity of it all, that your located in Awatukee. Let me start by saying that this bagel shop is clean; that being said there is no atmosphere but who is expecting atmosphere in a bagel shop. The bagels are some of the best I've had in Phoenix and definitely worth the drive. I found the owner (I'm guessing he was the bagel man) to be polite, client orientated, and knowledgeable. If I didn't know any better I would say that the bagel man is from a small town somewhere, because memories of my childhood in the Midwest were reminiscent as we experienced all that was the bagels from the bagel man.  Mr. Bagel man all you need to do now is deliver bagels to my office in downtown phoenix and the world would be tolerable.

This wasn't my first time going to strand. With good experiences in the past it seemed to make sense to go back on a Friday. The hostess was polite and seated us promptly. The server stopped by shortly later to take or drink orders(and we put in for the drunken cheesy bead appetizer due to happy hour ending shortly.) The drunken cheesy bread was meh, but our entrees were very good. I had the chicken something or another that the server recommended and it was the best dish of the bunch. I would recommend strand to anyone. The drinks were very tasty and strong without tasting strong. The atmosphere is nice as well.

The pizza was awful. The servers were fine, but the kitchen closed shortly after I arrived at 6:45pm. How is that possible? 7pm kitchen closing on a Friday. No wonder the place was empty. Maybe it's better for lunch. This place has an identity crisis, is it a convenient store, coffee shop, or restaurant? The name of the establishment doesn't help clear up the ambiguity either.

The best cheese steak I've ever had, but that's not saying much since I'm not fond of the cruddy meat used in most cheese steak sandwiches. Here they use quality meat in their sandwich and the flavor and turnout shows that it's working. The problem is that they don't have the man power to pump out the sandwiches fast enough for me to go there during lunch. You could wait upwards of 30 minutes for your food. Too long for me. I hope they fix this problem in the future. I'll give em a try again in a month or so.

One of my favorite sushi places in town. The sushi is generally very fresh, and it's generally decent quality. The prices are competitive and the fact that you can eat immediately upon entering is great. The atmosphere is fine and the service speaks better English than many Chinese restaurants, but not better than most sushi joints.

While I am an avid supporter of giant coffee there is something about shine that I can't seem to shake. Maybe it's the indoor/outdoor vibe or the perfectly made cappachino. I'm not really sure, but for sure Shine is a coffee spot worth experiencing and possibly a daily visit for me going forward.

This upstairs patio is 3 stars and the dining room is 5 stars. Service on the upstairs patio is slow, but the view was nice. In addition, I didn't get a refill on my coffee due to I'm guessing the distance the server would have had to go to get it for me. The Grilled cheese and tomato soup was above par. The wedge salad was delicious, the pizza also delicious. I haven't had drinks here yet, but I'm sure they're fine. Service inside the dining room was considerably better than the upstairs patio.

Worth a visit. The food is solid, the atmosphere interesting, the prices surprisingly cheap. Mimosas and bloody marys (big ones) for 3 bucks. That's what I'm talking about. I've eaten here twice and both times the service was good. I will return.

The best place to buy unique used/new stuff. Why buy junk from ikea or stuff made in China, when you can buy classically sweet "well made" stuff? Simply Awesome. Go check it out.

I've eaten here once; I got their food to go once; and I walked out without eating once. My first visit was odd. I ordered the staff recommended Mexican eggs Benedict. The plate was way overpowered buy the taste of chili. Chili for breakfast is not appealing nor tasty.         For the takeout "I went back to give them a second chance" I ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, and tators. It was good.           Then came my final visit. I arrived on a weekend with four family members including my wife. When we came in my wife sat at a table while I went up to order (it's weird but you order at a counter NO servers here). While I was waiting to order a manager or staff member went over to my wife and told her that she "couldn't squat at tables, that the tables turn over fast and that she could only sit down after ordering". Odd right? My wife got up feeling unconformable, told me what happened and we left.          To be honest their food isn't that good. I just wanted desperately to find a breakfast place to go to regularly. Phoenix is missing good breakfast places.

I agree with the other reviewers the service is subpar, and I sat at the bar. The beers are good, but the board(of beers on the wall) is lacking in details I want to know when doing a tasting. The restaurant also feels kind of empty. I know their going with a minimalist theme, but it's a little over the top.

This is the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I don't say that lightly, I've eaten at pizzeria bianco, cibo, spinatos, pizza a metro, and the like. At Federal they use fresh ingredients and it was tasty. Hipsters have infiltrated this establishment though. So if you have a fear of hipsters this isn't the spot for you. The house-made wine coolers are nice as well.

Sam's club gas is the best part of Sam's club and is a must stop every time I go to Sam's club. The last time I went the prices of premium (the downside of a nice car) was a quarter cheaper than the going rate elsewhere.

We had drinks and I'm so happy we did. You have to try this place for yourself to understand its grandeur.

The atmosphere was pleasant. The service amazing.  The Filet was 5 stars and the ribeye was 4 stars. The price was reasonable. And oh was it clean. Definitely a 5 star experience.

Everything was great, but my sausage on my sandwich was really big.  :) Management knows what they're doing here. I would definitely go back. I only have one criticism, why is the espresso machine so old. This place has money can't they afford a good quality machine?

Hands down the best Pizzaria in Phoenix. Better pizza than cibo, more homey than pizza biancos, and better service than spinatos. I enjoyed my first trip profusely and I will return.

This place is amazing. The cupcakes are to die for. I'm so happy they're in the hood.  Nothing like gong to dinner and getting desert here afterwords. I got the peanut butter cookie and i want disappointed. The cupcake was melt in your mouth delicious. The staff was bubbly and friendly. I liked there stuff so much i ordered a 100 cupcakes for my bars soft opening.

The cupcakes are to die for and the cookies aren't too shabby either. I had amir a dozen chocolate chip cookies. .. Just like mom used to make. I do believe toys may be the best bakery in town.

HOLY MOLY, that's a good pizza pie. Lol. But seriously, Arcadia is a hot bed for good pizza and these guys are cutting themselves a pretty good Slice of that business by being awesome. The Pizza was really good, with fresh ingredients, and it's larger than their competition at LGO and Nook for about the same price. I'd get in there now before everyone realizes how amazing this place is and you have to wait... the dining room is on the smaller side and they don't serve booze, but they are only a few doors down from The Pigs Meow and I have it on good authority from their ownership their that you can bring these delicious mouthwatering pies into their bar.     They say New York style, but the staff and ownership are way to nice to be New York, "style". The wait was gonna be a little long on our pie so the owner(I think he was the owner) gave us a slice of cheesecake... DAMN it was tasty, and local to boot.    I will be going back and I'm happy to say that this is defiantly one of the best pizza places in Phoenix and probably my favorite now.

Went for lunch, sat at the bar... Couldn't be more satisfied. The house toast was one of the best appetizers I've had in quite some time. The bartender provides excellent service. I'll be back.
