I had better. Takes way too long, and this place went downhill in quality and service over the last 3 years.

It was great the last few times...  till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them.

Pretty darn good pork bbq sandwich. Good service. Laid back fun atmosphere.  I went for a late dinner on a weekday night. Was spacey, not crowded at all, and food was relatively quick.  Parking is kinda tricky to figure out at first

Super Pricy.  However, the only place I trust with my competition evening gowns with all their beadwork and boning altering. She made things happen that other tailors said were  "impossible".  Sylvia really makes miracles happen and fixes even the most hopelessly ill fitting gowns to fit me perfectly. (I'm a size 0000p) She has some expert solutions and her finishes are very neat.  Heck, if I could only land my apprenticeship here!  The store operates till 8 PM on the weekdays which is more accessible to me since I get off work around 6:30 PM. Most tailors shops are closed by this time.  Expect to pay designer prices.

Sometimes they have additional 30, 40 or 50% off clearance items depending on the season.  I found a pair of lightwash destroyed "erin" skinny jeans for under 10 bucks in the clearance section way in the back. Score!  XS sell out really fast. If you're a size M or L, some good deals in the clearance section if you look

The service was wonderful and the server was very nice, but ... DON'T GET THE PAD THAI. Its NOT pad thai.  The young coconut... it was served whole with a spoon. The coconut meat was to tough to scrape out with the spoon. But the coconut water was refreshing.  I think I'll stick to Touch of Thai in north phoenix

I got the Sicilian thin crust pizza. Yum. 15.49 for a small sized pizza (radius about 5", so 10" diameter). My man says the strawberry limeade was good, + they give free refills.  Cute holiday themed to-go box.  Kind of on the pricy side.

Fresh ingredients cooked and served warm.  I liked their soft shell shrimp tacos, and the new bbq Carnita(sp?) tacos. I liked the texture, seasoning, temperature, harmony of the flavors.  I tried the chopped chicken ranch salad before, it wasn't too exciting and way over-dressed.  The chips and salsa weren't too great.  I like the interior decoration here.

After a 10 min wait outside,  Friday 6:55 PM entered the restaurant. Ordered 7:05 PM. Orders came out way past 7:40 PM. The manager was going around apologizing for delays. We couldn't leave till 8:30 PM.   Our server "Chad" was not paying attention and making mistakes that could be avoided.  He brought out a french onion soup instead of clam chowder after the 35+ min wait.  We ate: The portions were small but the quality was above average.  We gave a coupon to Chad.  Chad: "Seperate checks or all together?" us: 3 seperate checks please. Chad: Together, got it. us: We'd like to split the check between 3 parties please.  He processed our bill and came back. The coupon was not applied so we flagged him down again.  Chad: "How was everything guys? Food come out in a timely manner? (dead silence)  Well you're one of the lucky ones" he said.  No, No, and No. Just because we weren't more vocal like the other customers doesn't mean we were one of the "lucky" ones.  Then he came back. The coupon was applied but he had forgotten 2 of our credit cards. He looked through his apron smock thingy and pulled out the other two credit cards. "Wow, that looks bad doesn't it?" he said. No comment, dead silence.  He came back with the receipts and one pen... which didn't work at all. At this point, we decided to procure another pen on our own and just sign and tip and get out of there.  I had a bad experience and it was rather disappointing. Would not go back for a long time.

The clearance items sell out like hotcakes. They're a lot more out of stock than other Hollister stores on print / summery items.  Comfy clothing, though sized a bit bigger than what it says. Their summer cotton shorts are sized a lot larger than denim daisy dukes.  There are size variances even within the same clothing categories such as bandeau. Some have cups in them, others don't, some are tight, others are loose.  I usually go for the clearance section to find clothing of value.  Got lucky a few times. Friendly staff most of the time.  Its just too bad the store is flippin dark and its difficult to see the true colors of your clothing :p

Stopped by around 1 PM to buy white non-cargo petite scrub pants. Amanda showed me the product, I tried it on, bought it. I was in and out in 5 minutes. Prompt assistance. Polite staff. They do their jobs well. Healthcare professionals get 10% off, bring your badge : )

I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook.  The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland. Sauce didn't mix well with the pasta either. The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own. If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p  The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce.  I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited.  The waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Appetizer: calamari was yummy.  I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.   But I guess that would raise costs/prices huh. :/

Went on a Tuesday morning around 8:45 AM. Experience was a lot different from the weekend mornings. One person ahead of me. Garlic bagel with Onion and Chive spread. Maybe I was REALLY hungry but it was Delicious! Try the strawberry spread on a plain bagel too, its so pink and tastes yummy too.

I look for deals in the clearance section. I'm a super petite gal.  Rue 21 had some tank tops that were on 3 dollar clearance. I got a coupon for Nov 19-21 50% sale so I MIGHT go back there. They don't have XS tho. Their jeggings are very comfortable and priced at 19.99.  I'm too short to wear them. their inseams are long  for me. (I'm an inseam 30, 5 ft 1" tall) cute red flanel shirt with detachable hoodie at 21.99.  PacSun,.. not so much. Quality of the jeggins was MEH and the price isn't really justifiable.  Ann Taylor has some good basics and jewelry if you pay attention. I liked a few of the necklace selections. There are a lot more L and M sizes on clearance than other sizes. Recommended for moms and career women, but I couldn't wait to get out.  Banana Republic has some stuff, but not that much of a deal. The hideous fashion colors are all here. Recommended for moms and older professional demographic. Not my market.  Aeropostale -- I got a button down plaid flanel shirt for 5.99 and a lace cami tank top for 2.99. There was a cute 9.99 quality pair of joggings but they only had size L.

Updates! I went to RUE 21 with my coupon I got (from last review) and bought two pairs of jeans for 20 bucks. One's a dark jegging (jeans but feel like leggings), which is almost as good as Abercrombie & Fitch ones.

My man says service is not perfect, but I think its just fine, all is forgiven bc of the wonderful food.  I really like the tempura zyaru soba. I don't think I had up to standard zyaru soba in AZ before till I found this place. The chicken skewers are really good here too.  The tempura is really fresh (Fried prawn and veggies),   Curry Udon was so and so but I have been spoiled by my own recipies.  Gotta warn you that this place alwasy looks closed, so don't get fooled by the appearance. Always tug on the door before you head back to another eatery : ).

Got soft tofu soup. They mixed up our order. My bf thought his soup was bland while I was burning up and breathing fire lol. The food was mediocre, aside from the mix-up. Priced a lot higher than what its worth. Small portions.

Bring your student ID for discounts. Instead of paying 92 bucks at Fred Astaire, this is a cheap alternate cheap option. Of course its not as technical and personal as Fred Astaire, but I'm saying $ value-wise.  There are beginner group lessons (I think it was every Friday 7 PM its been a while...), followed by intermediate group lessons. I think I paid around 10 bucks or below.  Then the floor is open for all sorts of dances.  Great way to have fun, practice, and learn new stuff.  There are refreshments too, which is awesome : )

I didn't go during happy hour... I knew I wouldn't be able to find seating.  I went for lunch. Had fried calamari in a creamy spicy/zesty sauce which was surprisingly good.  Entree: Pad thai. Its aright, a lil too soy saucey/ awkward teriyaki for my taste  ~*I give it a four stars for the calamari (look for it during happy hour. get there early at 3 PM)*~

Went to shop here 1/2/2015. Bought a glossy pocket size planner in a cupcake design for 1 USD and discounted box of 20x holiday cards Bella Pilar for less than 5 USD. The 75% sale was definitely worth stopping by.  Also, staff was very patient, helpful, and friendly.

Not authentic, but tasty in its own way.  I go here for happy hour. I really like the viva las vegas roll. The crab cakes are of good value. Fried calamari is a bit bland but worth the volume (big)  Off the happy hr menu, my fav is the scallop dynamite roll. either you love it or hate it. It took me a couple tries to appreciate it.   the desert roll (bananas fried and topped with fruits, w/ a hint of white chocolate chip) was surprisingly good.  Walking around the mall after dinner is pretty relaxing.  Do not get the tempura icecream here. It was nasty.

I have never seen a campus with so many mosquito, wasps, cockroaches and ants oh my! They have stale, algae-ful pond water all over campus. Mosquito breeding ground. NS (natural sciences) building.... Every single lab I have there, I see a roach or two, about 2-3 inches in length. There are dead roach carcasses being eaten by ants.  Student center couch area by the cafeteria has HUGE roaches too.  The bathrooms are full of mosquitoes. I was pooping and it landed right on my eyelid and sucked my blood and flew away! Unless you can poop while dancing the mosquito swat dance, avoid the bathrooms. Also, they're constantly either out of soap, or the soap dispenser is broken.  SL (science lecture buidling) Fits a decent amt of students in one classroom. Their bathrooms smell like sn*tch and are frequently out of soap.  Every evening after class, while walking across campus, I get at least 2-3 mosquito or knat stuck in my eye (they just fly in there, and I have tiny eyes!) and 4-6 mosquito bites.  Campus is a f*ckin' maze. So plan on getting lost and walking around the first few days.  Carry cash on you. All photocopies cost money, cash only.  No library, so you gotta study in the halls, or in the NS tutoring center, which can get quite crowded in the afternoon. I got tutored for organic chemistry. The tutors: most know their material. Some are very patient and nice. Others are sarcastic and will talk down to you and belittle you. Its self-service. You walk in, log into the computer "sign in". Then sit down, and study quietly. Tutors usually come in around 1 PM and leave around 6 PM. Tutoring center also lends out textbooks.  Computing commons aka "information technology".... outdated. The computers take 10-15 min to boot up. Once you get google chrome running to pull up my.maricopa.edu,  the computer lags and freezes. Good luck using school computers. Bring your own laptop, especially if you're not a MAC person.  The tutoring center in the NS has a slightly faster computer.  The CHEM dept profs are excellent.  Pro of taking organic chemistry on this campus: Labs are up to date and the hoods work great. Great HNMR/ IR equipment that you'll learn to work with. You'd better have previous experience, or else you'll struggle with handling equipment and mastering the appropriate techniques. Helpful prof office hours  Cons: Classes are a bit bigger than most community colleges ACS exam required at the end of the semester as your final (30% of grade) ACS = american chemical society It was 110 minute long exam, 70 questions, multiple choice. I am normally an A student and I scored 45 / 70 on it.  I find this campus difficult to navigate compared to Paradise Valley Community College.  PVCC does not require ACS exams, and drop your lowest test score. SCC CHM dept organic chemistry require ACS exams, and factors all exams into your score.  PVCC gives out A's like candy. SCC I had to work my @$$ off to get a low B.  PVCC has limited lab space and equipment. No fume hood, micro scale synthesis out of a cheap kit inside a plastic box over your desk.  SCC has a full fledge fume hood with a sash to protect you, macroscale equipment and HNMR/ IR equipment too.  There are pros and cons. But personally, I prefer PVCC because the availability of the library, computing commons, and easiness of the courses.

*** no. Stay away.  Plane was not clean. They cut corners sacrificing quality. Food is beyond crappy. I'm sure some ppl's dogs get better food than that.  My last straw: They lost my luggage and it took them *THREE WEEKS* to find it and deliver it to my place. My sh*t arrived wet. Thanks Delta. I'll wear my soggy undies you bas***s.  Not to mention the flight delays which messes with the connection flights.

Okay, did I say bad?? WORSE. Negative five stars.  From San Diego, 1. they made us wait in line for ticketing. 2. Made us go check our bags  3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the "special needs" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight.   4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us. She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).  5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off. 6. "mechanical problems". 7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour. 8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.  9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)  10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD. 11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover. 12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me?  13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE.   ~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:  LAX to Tokyo: "mechanical problems" stayed another hour on the plane. Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere. Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!  Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.  Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?! Sorry Delta, I'm so exhausted, sick and tired of you. F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too.

Service is meh-- the server was zoned out, grumpy, and unprofessional. The kimchi and radish side dish are MEH. I liked their side dish of jap chae (clear noodles marinated in soy sauce and oil) tho.  I ordered dumpling soft tofu soup (medium spice). It was okay, not the best I had.  The rice is cooked in a stone bowl, scooped out in a stainless steel bowl and served.  water is poured into the stone bowl (some remains of the flaked rice is left) and is served. It appeared BROWN... like diarrhea the rice was okay but not spectacular. As for the stone bowl, DON'T even taste the contents. It left a bad burnt taste on my tongue. Gross. Totally ruined my meal.

I got honeydew snow boba. It was the best I ever had. I didn't know the tapioca could be so soft and chewy. The drink didn't flake and clog up like icee either.  Then again, I'm from Arizona where they have NO good boba.  They treated the customers well and acted like they appreciated their business.

I usually order the Chicken on the Barbie (my regular) They make it just right. Juicy and not dry, or overburnt.  The sweet potato fries are usually excellent. Honeyglazed w/ a very slight taste of salt. better than the ones at FEZ imo.  Keep in mind it depends on the customer's taste of what is good : )  I usually get good service when I'm here. I am seated quickly and the servers are prompt.

I went here for a buddy's bday party.  The sandwich one of us ordered was HUGE.  The clam chowder was kind of small but very fresh and tasty.  Sirloin steak was small but decent. Mashed potatos were yummy. So were the veggies. Food came out warm and in a fairly timely manner considering that it was a Sunday night.  My crusted chicken creamy marinara pasta (w/ extra marinara on the side) was excellent. I don't eat huge portions so it was just right. I didn't need a to go box.  The manager seemed very nice.  Desserts didn't interest me at this place, but the main course was tasty.  I would go again.

Hit or Miss. But I won't take my chances.  It really depend who's the server, and who's the chef.  Avoid the fat grumpy mean looking woman server with the broad face. (brunette, pink-ish skin tone, very shaped eyebrows that look angry) Holy *** the fat mean looking waitress with the blocky eyebrows will eat you alive, regurgitate, and chew you up and then spit you out.  Stay away. She's brash, unattentive, and discriminates against certain customers. She was continuously kissing @$$ to the customers next to us but treating my group of four with disrespect and contempt. I doesn't feel great to be discriminated against. As a customer, we're all spending money there, and I think we deserve the service we pay for.  ~*~* aside from that one waitress... *~*~* the other servers seem fine. The greeters are friendly.  Food is either hit or miss. 50/50 chance of getting excellent food vs. bland food. Over the years, the quality went down.  I really wouldn't risk it and rather go to the Chandler location if I could

HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October) it hurts my lungs to breath.  I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay. The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!! ~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*  I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education. I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.  For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.  Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition. Very little hands-on and help with internships. Way too much groupwork and free-riding. They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.  Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses. They have their teaching assistants teach us.  Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes.  Junior year when you get admitted into the "professional program" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.  The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)  There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes. The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.  Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college. Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.  Expect to wait in line wherever you go. ASU accepts way too many people. It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.  Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need. The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school. They are not informed enough to advise you.  I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration. I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.  Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007. Gross!!  One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.  The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.  ASU is not the most safe neighborhood. I have been approached by many shady people.  do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus. They are beyond crappy and overpriced. You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads. The "freshman year experience" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it. and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).  I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.  Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student.  Hope this helps.

The owners are Korean, the lady was really nice. She made eye contact and smiled and greeted us.  The guy... I don't think he meant to be racist, but when a couple Latinos/ ppl of Hispanic decent came in the store and orders, he goes "Amigo, someting wrong?"  I could not believe my ears lol.  The food... I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic)  I ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi.  Sukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat. Bulgogi was not well seasoned.  The food was bland and nasty.  Was NOT worth the 15 bucks. Would not go back again.

The service was great. The owner was really nice, and very sensitive of needs of my party (a friend that had a disability) I had Mapo Tofu. It was okay.  When I came home my man told me about the server who squashed a cockroach with his hand and showed it to his co-worker. I barfed about half an hour after that.

tom  yum noodle soup (tofu and veggies). served with anglehair noodles, mushroom, tofu, bean sprouts, and other veggies.  I got a HUGE bowl for 7.50 or less, I ended up taking home about half my bowl and I got another meal out of it.  Order took less than 4 min, Staff was attentive, helpful and friendly. Facility was clean.  Seems like manager/owner actually cares about his customers.  I also liked the sweet and pungent chicken. Served with a big bowl of rice.   I would def recommend to a friend.

Really hit or miss.  One day there was nothing but crap, another day, I found a gorgeous formal gown with some beading and threading flaws for 11 bucks! I fixed it up and hemmed it for 30 bucks and now its a top tier prom gown.  I also found a variety of size 4 shoes on different occasions. Being a super petite size, its difficult to find my size, but this store has it for women with itty bitty feet. Heels, wedges, you name it.  downside: Some of the merchandise is dirty, damaged, or ugly, merchandise display is messy, but if you look hard enough you'll find something for a steal on a lucky day.  Downside: lines are LONG, no returns, crowded on weekends, challenging to find parking.

I'm a kid that goes by the rules of No drinking, no gambling I was offered a room on the 19th floor with "a view of the strip". Psh. I couldn't see sh*t. I could barely see a bit of the strip if I squished my face onto the glass.  I had a good view of the middle of nowhere and a barren airport. Fun. :/  The room was clean.  ***Everything in the fridge/ snack bar is weight-sensitive so even if you slightly MOVE the items it will automatically charge your credit card.***  The pool area was nice tho. The wave/tide pool is over-rated since the waves only form every 5 min or so.  The lazy river was nice.  The pools I liked because they were 4 ft deep thus I couldn't drown :D yay for being considerate to shorties that can't swim.  I saw the musical the Lion King here. The theatrical representation was pretty cool. But they will jip you on the stale cold popcorn so don't get it!  Oh, and bring your own waters. I got charged 6 bucks for a small bottle of water at the pool area.  The air in the rooms is pretty bad. Smoky and stale. (and I got a non-smoking room) Its like living in a nicer, more maintained version of a college dorm.  Oh, and DO NOT eat at The Noodle Cafe downstairs. Worst Asian Food I EVER had

Interior decor was contemporary and enjoyable.  However, the sweet potato fries were not that great. Very dry. Much better fries can be found at Outback Steakhouse (i-17 and Peoria) The sweet potato sauce/dip wasn't to my taste. (sour)  Neither was the pizza... it was different. It had a soggy pear on it. Soggy like from a can. The cheese on there was raw.  Some people like it. I guess it depends on taste. If you enjoy trying very different food, go for it.  Service was slow, the waitress was not attentive to our needs (Water), and there was a huge  fly in the restaurant charging at my food. Seems like the fly liked the food more than I did. :/

Went here again for a friend's birthday party tonight. We sat outdoors.  Nice, spacey, fun hangout atmosphere.  Our waitress was so nice and on top of things. Her name is Candace (sp?).  She was in charge of our group at the patio. Very polite, attentive, and friendly.  The sweet potato fries were MUCH better this time. The cinnamon sugar kind of hurt my teeth fillings but whatever, I like sweet potato fries!  The hummus ... set a fire in my mouth. it was surprisingly spicy which was unexpected. Not a fan of spicy hummus, but if you like that kind of stuff, try it.  Pita was fresh and warm.  Bread was thin but hard. I prefer soft bread but thats just my preference. The seasoning for bread tho is good stuff. The pesto and marinara for the bread were especially tasty.  Parking was a struggle, it gets so full on a Friday night. We had to park at a meter :/ Buh  I liked this place for a late din/ hangout place rather than a lunch place. Totally dig the cool interior lighting at night.  If only I could find parking more available/accessable, I would totally go again when I'm visiting central Phoenix.

Dancers are pretty good. They're actually hot.  Had a fashion show once here. I really liked the experience. Good VIP rooms. Spacey.  Also had birthday celebration here. I would say its aright. good music, okay crowd, fun atmosphere. I like chilling upstairs and looking down at the dance floor.  The bouncers are usually pretty cool. The guys here are MEH tho... especially as the time gets close to 2 AM they get drunker and drunker and they're really ugly, sleezy, and persistent.

Quick and budget friendly for small eaters like me. This is the place I stuff my face in between breaks from work.  bacon, cheddar and potato pizza is my fav. + jones creme soda (my fav creme flav soda) = my ideal meal.  I had this every day, and I work 5 days a week lol. Still not sick of it yet.  Staff is fast and usually friendly.  One of the employees Carlos provides good customer service and is very courteous.

Nice Mall-scape.  I like sitting outside near the fireplace on the sofas during the winter and read books.  The kids go krazy @ the in-ground water fountains, which is pretty annoying sometimes.  Not a huge variety of stores.  I got my wallet stolen at this mall at the food court yard outdoors so *watch your stuff* while you're chilling/ reading.  Oh,  a couple toddlers were throwing rocks at trees and hit me, and they started cracking up. Their mothers were too busy talking to even notice.  Darn those lazy b*tches and their brats! tsk tsk bad parenting.  The restaurants are meh. I like *some* stuff from Rubio's but thats about all.

The only thing I tried here was the vegetarian Taco Salad. I like the crunchy shell. Fresh ingredients. lettuce, dressing, black beans, sour cream, tomato salsa, red salsa, corn. It fills me up for at least 3-4 hours. I usually get a to go box for it, but when I'm really hungry I eat the whole thing... people wow at how such a petite gal could chow down the whole thing. Its called being hungry.  I really wish they had the smoked chiplote tabasco sauce here cuz it would really go well with my taco salad. (yes, I'm a chipotle addict and decided to give this place a try :p)

Bad. They made us sign our names and compared it with their drivers license, and took pictures of us with a digital camera. Accused us of a false ID. One of us got turned away because of an out of state drivers license.  One of our guys got turned away because one of us wasn't wearing dress shoes, but wearing Lacoste fancy looking tennis shoes.  Air is rotten. Dancers aren't as good looking or skilled as other clubs. the crowd is meh.  By far the crappiest club I have ever experienced.

My company usually booked me United every month I traveled. They're my last hope out there. They have been fairly consistent, on time, and friendly. Didn't lose my luggage a single time. (southwest lost it once, Delta screwed up bigtime and took 3 weeks) So I'd give them a four star.

I like their tuna sandwiches, fresh cut fruit, and potato salad. Seems moderately healthy.  I like the open atmosphere and the contemporary yet ergonomic interior deco.  Faster than most places.

Owned and operated by Koreans. Food is aright to the average person, bit on the high $$ side though. I'm a picky eater, so I'll have to say I can't rate them high on the taste or quality.  Service was outrageously bad though. We had a very nosy Korean Waitress, and she would interrogate my group with personal questions.  btw; this is the same nosy waitress that used to work at Mido Sushi.  Holy crud, save me from her!!! RUN.

I'm a regular there. I usually get the spicy pork BBQ and soft tofu soup (T12 combo, with dumpling soft tofu soup)  I like the T12 combo the most from what I have tried so far.  Most of the time the food tastes fabulous.  There were a couple times when it totally missed, but so far I had the best spicy pork BBQ and soft tofu (dumpling) soup in AZ.  Don't get the Kimchi and pork stir fry. It could be better. Don't get the dumpling and rice cake soup. Cold spicy buckwheat noodles are 50/50. Sometimes is excellent, sometimes its meh. Assorted veggie bi bim bap (mixed rice w/ egg, veggies and spicy paste) are pretty good here. I had better spicy rice cakes, and its not the best dish they have.  Price is not too bad.  The young waitress is very attentive and nice.  There's Korean TV (dramas, game shows, etc) on if you're into that.

I went for lunch on a weekend recently. Kimchi pancakes, spicy pork bbq lunch special.  The seasoning on the pork bbq wasn't what it used to be. It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland. The sauce is probably watered down. It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.  The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.  I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times, I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)

Fun, engaging classes that really help with form, rhythm, style. Helpful instructors, especially Andrew. Wonderful private lessons. Plenty of floor space.  conveniently located in the middle of everything.  Only complaint: Super Super high end so expect to pay designer prices.

This is not a buffet.  I went in on a Tuesday 7 PM. The place was dead.  I got the hot and sour soup which was pretty good. 5.95. Pretty good portion. Split between 3 people.  XO sauce spicy fried rice... NOT spicy at all. Very bland. Probably won't get that again.  Assorted veggies plate with rice... it was okay. Wasn't the best I ever had but not bad either.  Service was kind of slow, as it took a while to get seated when there was nobody else in the restaurant, and longer than I would like for them to take my order.  You have to ask for ice waters if you want it otherwise they won't give it to you. You only get tea :p  They pour your tea for you and serve your soup for you which is kind of nice.  But the food... nothing too special to drive a long way for.  Overall, I don't think I will go again, but I guess its a good place to get to go stuff if you're into that.  I also noticed they do dim sum till 3 PM.

they have a good variety, but the customer service there is meh. Nobody really knows where anything is and you can't get a hold of a clerk.  You have to pay cash if you buy less than 10 bucks.  Oh, and I found a squished dead ROACH in my food I bought from there. The processed veggie sausages....  3" ROACH *shudders* all squished with its guts hanging out.  I am too traumatized to go back.

Pretty good. I like their sauce that they have at each table, especially the spicy version.  I get pork bbq and fries. Gets a little messy but thats cool.  Fast. Look for the value lunches. I like it because it includes a drink (you refill yourself)

Great service. Friendly staff.  Pricy, but uses plant extracts, environmentally friendly, has no sulfate or paraffin, not tested on animals. Gentle ingredients that don't irritate my sensitive skin.  Their unique graphic design and location appeal to me.  My fav is the Mango Evasion because of its scent and creative design.  I also like their repairing hand butters (not hand cremes), it really works.

Not the quality education I was looking for. The professors are disorganized and can NOT teach, especially lab. In particular, CHM 151LL and 152 LL Dr. Indu Mishra will take off points for no reason even for a perfect lab report. Inconsistency in grading, students with less accurate data end up with higher grades on the lab reports. Run the other way while you can.

My fav is the Chicken Tikka Masala and their seasoned rice. Their Samosas Choley is good w/ the red sauce. I will work for this stuff. (frequneter)  The gal that serves us water is super fast and efficient. My fav server is Suaznne (sp?). She's fast, outgoing, friendly, gets stuff done.  chicken tikka masala 14.95 seasoned rice 2.95 (?) samosas choley 6.95  I blow my paycheque here cuz the stuff I order above is yumminess.  I like the open atmosphere of this place.  they got belly dancing performances (dancer walks around shaking it while you eat) Fridays 7:30 PM ish.  Just remember they are closed Mondays, and have specific operating times for lunch (I think noon to 2:30?)

If you are super petite, this is the store to go to. I have all sorts of trouble finding clothes elsewhere. I just wish the prices were more moderate.  I did find some decent deals in the sales section tho.  They have 00's here, which is a size many manufactures ignore.  Style: They used to have a lot of cute stuff around December ish. The styles have changed a lot since then,  (not a huge fan of the draped tops or the zipper dresses/ bandage dresses)  but I still like the staff and service.  Great place to look for a party dress.  I bought a pair of  white shorts on sale here which were super comfy.  Staff was friendly, upbeat,  and made great suggestions. Helpful.

Bad service. Noisy. Plane is not maintained clean.  They do not prep the plane well mechanically thus our flight broke down in Tokyo. Wonderful. We all had to be bussed to the middle of nowhere in Japan where all forms of communication were severed w/ our families. (we passnegers had no local currency)

Not as high calibur and fresh/diverse as Ghengis Grill. Lunch specials is around 9.50 a bowl per person. Includes drink and soup and wonton crisps.  Meats are usually frozen and rolled up so get a tissue paper to stuff it into your bowl. Press! chicken, pork, beef. choose. I usually get pork.  choose your veggies such as mushroom, zuchini squash, bean sprouts, tofu, etc.  Throw some rice noodles into your bowl.  Add sauce. Add at least 5 to 6 scoops or you won't even taste it. cooking oil, sesame oil, lots of spicy thai, chili oil -- thats the way I like my food.  Hand it over to the Grill guy and wait.  Get your finished food, grab a drink, utensils, soup, and go seat yourself and eat.  There are no servers so that saves quite a bit on tips

They will greet you and seat you at a table with utensils. They will serve you water.  though the quantity is smaller than YC's Grill and the prices are higher, They don't charge 50 cents for to go boxes like YC's does.  Also, I enjoy the higher quality and greater variety of ingredients. ~*Its really hit or miss depending on what you create*~  My fav : crab meat + scallops + andoullie sausage + lil bit of ham cajun seasoning (2 spoons) + ginger seasoning  tofu, spinach, zucchini squash, lil bit of tomato, mushroom, lil bit of bean sprouts, lil bit of potato,  one big container of szechwan sauce, one small container of garlic chili oil  udon noodles,  and hand it over to the grill guy, and he hands you a number. You stick the number in the holder upper thing at your table.  Takes a big longer than YC's to cook.  but upside is you can go back to your seat and chill, the servers will bring your food to you in a fun looking bowl.  To go boxes are free, so if its too much, get it to go.  there are servers in this place, so expect to spend extra on tips too.

Owned and operated by Koreans. Rotating sushi bar. Not very authentic.  Takes forever to seat groups.  Takes about 20 minutes to seat ppl even if there is nobody in the restaurant.  The cheesecake was still frozen when I grabbed it. If I wanted a frozen cake, I would have ordered an ice cream cake from Coldstone

Thursday Karoke night. I got a taco salad. Served in a fried shell. Laid back cool staff. I liked it. Relatively big proportion and tasty, fresh ingredients. I would suggest adding your own toppings to enhance the flavor because it might be a tad bland for the average Jane/Joe.

The only reason I'm not giving it a one star is because of our wonderful server Cheryl. She totally rocked. Attentive, humorous, friendly, and constantly refilling our H20, she did her job well. But for the others....  First off, when I made my reservation for a party of 15, they took a reservation for 6. I corrected them "fifteeeen, as in ten plus five". They still got a table for only 6.  The greeter was unfriendly, she told another employee that "the party of 6 is now 15" with a rotten attitude, and t he other employee's face turned into "wtf you kidding me?!" face.  So they put some tables together for us. Sat down and ordered. Manager came around checking on us.  I got Baked Rigatoni, tasted like nuked plastic (plasticy cheese that solidified the pasta)  Garlic bread and breaded fried calamari w/ cheese was pretty good though.

Not very authentic, but good in its own way.  I like this place because I don't have to tip. Walk in, order, get food, eat, walk out, at my own pace w/o servers hovering over me.  I have tried:  The potato croquette. Pretty good.  Tempura Udon. Pretty tasty but a lil too salty afterwards. Usually the battered fried veggies and shrimp + noodles + the fried flakes fill me up.  Might not be big enough in portion for some ppl though.  Fried California roll : Battered and fried. tastes good with teriyaki sauce (which is basically sweeetned and thickened soy sauce)  Crunch Roll. Battered fried shrimp, rice, avocado wrapped in nori (seaweed), coated in fried flakes Pretty good but I'm not a big fan of shrimp to start with. If you like fried shrimp, go for it.  If you're looking for something authentic and expensive, go to Shimogamo.  This place isn't priced too horribly for what I get, but then again  I'm very petite and I don't eat that much so I usually get one Golden /fried CA roll with a croquette and maybe a Ramune (Soda with a marble stuck in a bottle) and all is digested in a few hours and hunger returns.  If you're an average sized person, might have to order more than one dish to not walk out hungry lol

The juicy outlet here is priced higher than the one in Camarillo. I saw a "go juicy" shirt that was 14.99 in the Camarillo Outlet for twice the price here! Its also very crowded with shoppers, so I guess its supply and demand doing its work.  They have a decent selection of bags.  The prices aren't that great. I saw better at a retail store in Santa Barbara.

Happy hour.... gotta get there early right after you get off work. Otherwise it gets jam packed. For happy hr, you're only allowed to be seated on the patio so it sux in the summer.  I like the battered fried calamari  and the 5 dollar pizza-- BBQ chicken pizza. Pretty good value for those two items.  Can't say much about their other stuff.

Excellent! What a great place to celebrate my 5 yr data-versary : ) we got here a little before 6PM. There was no line. Its our tradition to go to an olive garden just like we did in the beginning  (its their fault we're in love, they started it in 2005 by setting up the mood when we were "just friends"!)  Our server was so friendly and easy going, he put us at ease and we were able to enjoy the meal. The team there was attentive, fast, and courteous.  I got a virgin Tangerine Palermo(sp?) b/c I don't drink alcohol.  Its off the menu since a few years ago but if you ask the bartender he will make it for you. Its the best drink ever.  At first, they did serve me an alcoholic version of it without carding me which I thought was a bit odd since I look twelve. I took a huge sip in an empty stomach, and yikes it was STRONG and I got buzzed and a mild headache that followed,...  anyways the server fixed it and got me a virgin tangerine palmero(sp?) and apologized.  I got the trio sampler: stuffed mushrooms pork ravioli battered fried calamari.  Dang good stuff, especially the calamari!  I also got the new "Lasagna Fresco" (?) basically stuffed lasagna with plenty yummy cheese and tomato sauce. I loved this dish.  Minestrone was hot and fresh as usual.  I would totally go back again, even if I got an unintentional buzz.

Freeeeeeezing indoors. So I sat outdoors. It was 100+ degrees outside . It was comfortably cool with the parasols and misters and fans.   The only annoyance sitting outside was the huge disgusting fly that kept charging at my food and landing on it. :( Sigh. You need to hire a professional fly swatter if you're gonna sit outdoors. I would want my food too if I were a fly. Its so yummy!  Very fresh pita and hummus. Food comes out warm. Excellent harmony of taste w/ the fresh cut tomato, hummus, and pita.  I thought the grape in hummus looked tasty so I consumed it whole... only to find out that it was an olive! (it had a huge seed in the middle, followed by an extremely olive-y taste)  I got the southwest style chicken on pita seasoned with cheese. It was really good. Chicken was a little bit dry but the seasoning was done well. I liked the taste and texture of tomato, beans, corn, and seasoning that gave this dish its unique flavor.  I ended up having 2 and half meals out of this one dish. (but then again, I'm a size 00p if that tells you anything)  Would totally go here again.  Its a classy place with friendly service. I would recommend it.

Hit or miss.  I fly every month usually on United or AA.  On my way to Denver, CO: Pilot and crew were fun, engaged, and gave us helpful updates. Pretty comfy despite the fact that the plane was almost full. We arrived early 15 min early.  "ladies and gentlemen we are 15 min early to Denver, please keep this in mind when we're running 15 min late" -- pilot.  On the way back to Phoenix from Denver: SUCKed.  My group bought 4 tickets thru Expedia, prepaid for them. One of our kids got put on standby. Three of us were seated in the 8,9,10 rows while the poor standby kid got a seat in the 23 sections. What pissed me off was that they had tons of empty seats.  Minor issue: My seatback did not tilt back, it was stuck. The TV screen in front of me could not be turn off (other ppl's screens could be turned off),  Major issue: they served me a *SOILED BEVERAGE* It had clearly gone bad. Toxicity and Sourness radiated in my mouth on the first sip.  I am so turned off after this one experience that I will never fly this airline again unless all other airlines go out of business (which the gov't will prolly bail them out of anyways)  :/

Amy, our server was very attentive and pleasant. She was wearing this pretty blouse and I asked about it, and she told me the owner's mother sells them on Fridays (?). Def going to check that out next time. I really hope they have itty bitty sizes for me.  Food: Nan was overcooked, the bottom side was burnt.  Chicken Tikka Masala: seasoning, texture, and consistency of the dish was excellent.  Chicken was just a tad try but overall, great flavor. Would be more awesome if they sliced up the chicken into smaller cubes to give flavor consistency. Recommended esp for ppl who don't like spicy. Its very "umami" : ) I enjoy the creamy touch this place gives to it, shich distinguishes this place from other places.  Seasoned rice: came out warm, cooked just right  Samosas Choley: Non-spicy dish.  I eat it with the red sauce (spicy) to add a lili kick. The exterior was fried crispy just right, and the mashed potato inside were soft and warm.  Beans were very well seasoned and cooked, could tell they put time into it.  Methi Chicken: I tried this dish for the first time and I must admit I like it quite a bit. Ordered spicy. Have water prepared! (Amy was diligent w/ H20)  I wish I could go to this place every day if I could afford to!

You can totally tell they are cutting costs everywhere. The cabin walls vibrated loudly beyond normal while we were flying. (I travel every month so I know what a plane should sound like)  Not to mention that the pilot landed crappy and us passengers got whiplash

I went Thursday evening around 6 PM. The lines were long, there were a lot of people. the rides had lines almost down to the ground.  I went again Friday 7 PM for the dive in movie. There were sooooo many ppl  it was difficult to enjoy the experience.  The wave pool: I could not swim or ride the waves for 2 ft without bumping into somebody. People were screaming everywhere, lots of hair, debris, bugs in there. I even stepped on a stray swim suit bottom lol.  Waves come every 5 min or so and there are about 10-20 waves each time. They come from different directions, and depending on where you're at (especially in the shallow end) you can get hit really hard. My swim suit almost fell off so I suggest wearing something sturdy.  A kid puked in the wave pool, thats when I exited. People still swam in there after she puked.  Lazy river "cactus cooler"... You can only get on and get off in a designated area. There was a line. Took a while to secure a tube (everybody is required to ride a tube in the lazy river) After one trip around the river, we all got kicked out. I know other people waiting in line should be given a chance,  but it was kind of lame from a paying customer's point of view.  The rides: I went on the red one... raging river or whatever its called. The ride was kind of chill, lots of splashing. A bit cold for the night. The wait was reallllly long, all the way to the ground and then more lines on the ground.  I got on a turquoise-blue-green water slide. It was alright, but not a thriller.  The movie... the screen was a tiny little blow up thing erected on the side of the wave pool. I was kind of disappointed. I thought it would be on the huge wall on the deep side of the wave pool or something.  The cameras for some of the scarier rides take pix of your party, its around 10.99 each. Every time I go either the cameras/ system is broken so I'm guessing its not reliable. The kiosk for the photos/ lockers have almost nobody during the PM so we had to wait 5 min to get somebody to help us just to know that our ride's (raging river/ red ride)'s camera was broken.  Parking is 7 bucks. Small lockers are 7 bucks. They give you a bright pink RFID bracelet (waterproof) Tube rental: one person "O" tube is 6 bucks and the double "8" tube is 12 bucks. They don't let you bring your own floatie or beverages into the park. Lame. No alcohol permitted either. There's a line for everything: rides, food, bathroom, etc. Only thing there's no line for is the wave pool which is usually pretty crowded.  Ride reviews: Red one (raging river): 3-4 person tube/ raft ride. Not scary, pretty chill. Goes back and forth as you ride down and splashes you.  Green and blue toilet ride:  Two person tube FUN but not scary (well, maybe the initial fall for a breif moment) You go down a tunnel, ride the walls of a "toilet bowl" round and round three times (kinda slow) and get flushed backwards into the final tunnel. They take your pix.  yellow and green "serpintine?" water roller coaster type of deal. You ride a 2 person tube They make you fall steep, then shoot you up again rapidly. Go through tunnels and repeat. Super fun you get splashed. But keep your butt up bc the falls hurt.  Rainbow slide "desert racer": Not as extreme as it looks. They give you a blue foam sled with handles on it.  You go face first into a tunnel. Some sharp turns and lots of speed. You get spit out into an open slide, one moderate bump, if you have enough speed you'll catch some air and get Splashed in the face.  "Tornado" ... the marigold and blue funnel 4 person tube. They send you down a dark tunnel. Then you see light, a SHARP fall along the edge of the funnel. My stomach freaked (zero gravity free fall!). You get slid up on the funnel pretty high, fall, and slide again, do that about four times (each time less higher than the other as the funnel gets narrower) and get flushed out of the funnel into the hole in the back. They take your photos here so make a funny face when you're riding the first fall.  Lazy river is a lot more chill and enjoyable when there are less ppl around, but tubes tend to clump together. since you have very little control of your speed. Grab a double tube, lay back, put a hat on your face and relax.  Wave pool is more fun when you go in the deep end with a tube Not many ppl are in the deep end so its pretty chill there and I like the thrill of my feet not touching the ground.  I have a season pass, it used to be less crowded at the beginning of this month but now its way too crowded to enjoy. Bleh.

Yes. I tried their dduk man doo guk (dumpling and rice cake soup in anchovy broth) -- AWESOME.  Soon doo boo is pretty good too. Spicy tofu soup.  Their dduk bokki (spicy rice cakes) are SPICY and yummy.  Yook Gae Jang -- spicy broth, beef, clear noodles, veggies. Spicy and yummy!  Jja Jang (soy bean paste noodle) and Neng Myun (spicy buckwheat noodle), first few bites were good but then I got kinda tired of it.  Their sidedishes are well flavored.  Would recommend.

Now that I kinda figured out the layout its not that bad. I still don't dig the small turntable checkout, but I think getting good customer service kinda changed my attitude about this place.  There's a dude named Buster, he's energetic, helpful, friendly when I am wandering about the aisles trying to find the most random sh*t. He helped me find the exact stuff I needed, let me know about promotional deals.  This other time he was working at the register, greeted us and checked us out super fast all with positive attitude.  He even went out of his way to clean up a spill that happened on the next register and helped his co-workers.   Okay, merchandise.... I found a huge bowl of pre chopped cantaloupe for 3.99. My fav fruit on sale, pre-chopped (I'm very lazy) = happiness!  I come here for water, egg, fruit runs cuz they're reasonably priced. (esp the 25 cent water vending machine outside : )

I killed five hours here and had fun, especially anything related to the piano.  I enjoyed walking through the different instruments from all over the world. There are a lot of repeats within regions, as close by cultures have influenced each other. Sometimes there are really cool fancy instruments like the big embellished drum from Thailand (?).  What 's cool is that if you get close to the sensor of each display, your headset will play the music/sounds of the instruments, along with a visual display on the TV. Its pretty cool but wear comfy shoes for you will be standing quite a while!  My fav part is the downstairs mechanical music instruments, especially the scrolls of pre-punched piano music.  There is also a musical instrument experience room downstairs. My only regret is that they do not have a piano. They have 2/3 size guitars, Xylophone like wooden instruments, drums, etc

I found a light aqua blue T shirt for less than 14 bucks here. (Super comfy and I love the color) Also, found 3 bundle logo hairties for 6 bucks a bundle.  Staff was attentive, informative, and outgoing.

Takes a bit long @ the drive through, but what the hell, food comes out warm and tasty.  I got a taco salad (crunch tortilla bowl) and flan today. Mmmm yummy! Taco salad was very saucy (lots of sour cream and stuff..) and seasoned. Sizable portions (which means I have enough food for one and half meals-- I'm 5 ft 1 and 90 lbs)  I'd go again.

I got the chicken taco salad this time instead of the shredded beef. They have huge chunks of chicken breast in there. It was a little too much for me so I gave it to my man.  I went through the drive-through, they couldn't hear me very well so told us to go to the first window. They took our order and were reasonably fast and very friendly.  The taco salad came out to 5 dollars. Reasonable/ affordable price and the food is VERY filling, and I couldn't finish it. (box it up for later!)  They gave me tons of hot sauce yay. Fried tortilla shell was very fresh. Pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, shredded cheddar, chicken. My tummy wasn't too happy later but it was worth it!

Clean and well maintained. Friendly staff.  I got eyebrow wax (very quick and painless) upper lip wax  I got my first ever mani/pedi with custom natural nail design. (Bunnies + blingy flowers) 33+ 35 bucks I was scared but the ladies made me feel comfy.  They did a great job and put detail and effort into their works of art.  Would recommend to a friend.

Easy to schedule, get a courtesy call day before so I don't forget my appointment.  Friendly front desk staff : Attore is my fav bc she helps me feel at ease and is always willing to help customers.  Does not take as long as other dentists.  Get in, get my X-rays, teeth cleaned, get a consultation, and get out.  Dr. Lillien pulled all four of my wisdom teeth out. **oral surgeries are only available Tuesdays** Took about a week to recoup, Plenty of painkillers prescribed. I went under, and there were no complications. Oral surgeries are only done on Tuesdays. Recommend early morning surgeries because they make you fast for 8 hours. (no water, no food for 8 hrs!!)  Only complaint is that it took 3 tries to get the IV in my arm right. :/ Cries

Saturday 11 AM crowd of 6 ppl  Swedish Potato Hash FTW! We drove 40 min to try this place. I was scared bc of the unique foods and the exterior looks, but I had heard good things abt it.  Takes a while to make, so grab one of their games.  In our case, we brought our own.  My group played "Cards against humanity".  We were ROFL and noisy while the food was being prepared.  Staff was nice, esp owner.

Walk in, order, self-seat and self- serve.  Ordered Penne with marinara and sausage. The pasta was kind of on the moderate $ range, 6 bucks ish. and it was bland. Lacked seasoning and texture.  They were really friendly tho,... its a pity the food was crappy.  I can cook pasta better than them and trust me I am am horrible

Classy place located at the Holiday Inn.  The chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala were EXELLENT. I had both dishes at Tandoor 1 and 2, but this place tops all. Very well seasoned, thick rich and creamy with tasty herbs. Meat was juicy and just right.  Rice was consistent in texture.  A gal in braids served us. She had a foreign accent and was very awkward by tring to be overly friendly. but I'm sure she was just trying to be friendly to her patrons lol. I think she was a n00b, but I realized this place opened not too long ago, so she's likely still in training.  I asked her for a to go container for my makhani and masala, and she came out with one of those sandwich containers. Had to send her back to fetch a soup container bc the sauces will leak and make your car smell like Indian food for days!!  I would say I was impressed with the food. Not quite San Jose level, but close :)  I would def go back again if I drop by hat side of town.  If it were closer to home and more affordable, I'd eat it EVERY DAY :D

The Tikka Masala and Makhani are kind of runny compared to Tandoori Times, not as thick, but the owner is kind, good customer service. My fav is the mango lasse.  Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Makhani are my favs.  I always call in my orders beforehand. Convinient to go place.  But always remember to check our food before you take it home!

Sigh, I stopped going here because their omission rate was quite high. You're likely missing one thing or another. Whether it be rice, piece of samosa, or a drink,... something was missing on every occasion. make sure you check EVERYTHING before you leave with your to go bag. Most likely, something will be missing. The customer ahead of me was missing parts of his order too. Its sad.  The food varies depends on when you go / who makes it. Inconsistency... sometimes the chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani are excellent, other times its sad and runny and bland.  Mango lasses are still consistently good.  Hit or miss. I stopped disappointing myself and stopped going.

Went to Sunday lunch buffet. Buffet opened at noon. 13 USD per person. The chicken tikka masala and paneer butter masala were flavorful. The potato was nice too. The naan was perfectly textured. Their atmosphere is classy. Service is pleasant. The water does not taste like tap water and is actually tastes like soft mineral water (not iced). I think my boo and I were the only non-Indian/Pakistani there lol. Clean. Fresh. 13 USD for weekend lunch buffet. I would def go again. I think I found myself a new fav place.

Pricier compared to other card stores, but I love their selection. My fav is the Bella Pilar collection (fashion illustrator Bella Pilar) I have her boxed stationary cards, Mercedes fashion week tote (logo'd Papyrus, but same design) etc.  The picture frames at this store are darling. Very elegant.  I also like the "Jellycat London" plushies. I have one of the pink bunny plushies with a chime in it. Its very soft, cute, but expensive (nearly 30 USD after taxes)  Staff is friendly and attentive and good at giving suggestions.  they have wind-up music mini boxes made of wood. They have macarons erasers at the checkout counter. They also have some pretty colored marker-pens.
