Great service and food. Vegetarian and vegan friendly with portions on the larger side. The veggie patties and dolmas are delicious.  Both soups are great especially mixed with the rice!

Posh has a rotating menu of seasonal as well as different exotic and familiar foods served in the typical fine dinning course plating style. You provide very minimal information about your courses and the chef prepares it how he wishes on the spot. Posh provides a rare experience for the guest and proves that mundane or even food you never thought to try can be turned into magnificent pieces of art.

Bad service and food could be good if they actually included all the ingredients.. From what I have heard the Mac n cheese burrito is the only thing worth eating here. We had the Carne asada burrito and the casa chicken. The carne asada burrito is just chopped beef with Taco seasoning you buy from Walmart and that's about it, maybe it could be better if all the ingredients were in it. The casa chicken was again missing ingredients but much better than the burrito. This is my personal experience try whatever you want maybe you will have better luck. :)

Somewhere I can go to close my eyes and point to something on the menu and it will be good. Always have the best service and a great relaxed atmosphere with awesome people to talk to at the bar. A must if you are visiting phoenix or live and looking for something new!!

Amazing restaurant phenomenal food homie feel. Love to eat here and relax with friends and family while enjoying some of the best food in Arizona. Best to just try a little of everything even if you haven't had it before it will be good.

Cool concept and cool atmosphere but bad service and ok tacos. The tortillas used for the tacos are too thick for the delicate flavors inside of them which over powered all of my choices (Thai, duck, pork adavada, and cherry steak). I was looking forward to tasting all the ingredients throughout a bite, which were amazing, not momentarily and then followed by nothing but tortilla..
