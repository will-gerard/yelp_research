WASTE OF TIME! TERRIBLE SERVICE! I called ahead of time to make sure they had the dress I was looking for in my size and they confirmed that they did have it in the store. So I made an appointment to go that same day. Once I got there the girl that was assigned to help me, Selina, asked me what size I needed (which I had already told them was size 4). She took my measurements and left. I waited around for 20 minutes until she showed up with one dress, size 8, she said it would be the best fit for me. Confused, I tried it on thinking maybe she knew something  about my size that I didn't, but sure enough the size 8 was too big! I waited and waited and Selina never came back to check on me, I finally had to go look for her and tell her it didn't fit, and she responded "Oh, well thats all we have, the rest of the dresses are either really small or really big". I asked her if I could try on a smaller size and she argued with me and then walked off, came back with a different dress in a size 6, still not the size 4 or the dress I asked for. I tried it on, and she still never checked on me, I had to find her again and tell her to bring a smaller size and she responded "oh we actually don't have that dress in a smaller size". I asked her how could that be, when she just said she was searching through all of the sizes and they had it in a smaller size. She then  said "someone must have taken it off the rack and is trying it on". After two hours of just waiting around for Selina to help me, I got no where and walked out with nothing! She just did not want to help in any way, and seemed too busy to be bothered. Save your time and go somewhere else.

The best thai food in phoenix. I have ordered the eggplant dish, pad thai, lemon sole, and all three dishes have been delicious every time. The service has been fast and friendly every time. They do little cute things like making a rose bud out of the top of the straw wrapper and flowers/swans (not sure what they are) out of the napkins. I highly recommend this place just because of the food itself and rest is just topping on the cake.

Great sushi and a lot of diverse rolls and alternatives. I've only tried the H3 roll so far and it was amazeballs! The staff is very nice and attentive. I will be going back for more.

Really good pizza. They have a bunch of options for crust but all are crispy thin crust and you can select each ingredient you want on it.  You can make it healthy too!

I tried this new place out today and as a downtown resident I think it brings something new to the area where you can enjoy good beer (none of that Miller and Bud light nonsense) and great burgers! You can even make the burgers "healthier" by choosing different buns, protein, sauces, veggies.. Etc. you can even choose the Bowl option instead of the bun. Love that they are open until 9pm. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
