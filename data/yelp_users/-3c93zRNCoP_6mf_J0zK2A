Love this place! Great food, amazing service! I can't get enough! The sushi is on point and teppanyaki chefs are very entertaining!

I will start by saying great food and amazing salsa... However worst service and slowest wait staff I've ever encountered. It's not even busy in here. I ordered a beer literally 20 min ago and still haven't gotten it. Also the salsa is brought in a lil carafe and nothing to poor it in. Very odd and puts the patron in a difficult situation to figure out.

This place is great! Have been going here for over 10 years. Great service and great food. Portions are rediculously large for the price.

This place has everything! Best bowling alley ever! Love the fact that they have separate adult bowling lanes as well.
