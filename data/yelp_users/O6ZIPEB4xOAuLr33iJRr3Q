It says breakfast and brunch, yet no menu to back that up... Weak. How many people look for brunch? I saw farm so I felt that'd be a great way to start the day with some comfort scenery on a sunny day. Fail

Do not waste you hard earned money. Super fail. No flavor, no compensation for poor service and poor product. Sorry to see what was a good establishment go from 100% plus to almost 0% not only in the food quality, as well as service. Just so disappointed

Terrible service, every time. I do keep going back to get bean burritos for my sister in law on lazy Sundays, and it's always an ordeal. The one star is for the competence of making my food correctly, and nothing else. Waited 20 minutes or so just to get the guy to take my order, which never actually happened. So I pulled up to the window and was received with a look like I was bothering the gentlemen on who was inside. I asked to make an order and he proceeded to tell me I needed to get back in line and order at the menu in the drive thru. I told him I had been waiting as he slammed the sliding window shut in my face. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, and no food.

I paid for extra cheese and add tomatoes. A $14.00 combo turned into $25.00. I'm ok with that. What I'm not ok with is that not even half the tacos I paid for had the extras I paid for. Seriously? $10.00 more and still can't get it right. I don't eat fast food often at all, but this is disappointing when a chain restaurant can't competently complete what I would consider a straight forward order. Hey Taco Bell company, do you even give a shit!? Look at all Yelp reviews for this location and maybe look generally at your global scheme

Not only are John and Azi, the owners, polite and courteous, they make you feel like they have known you forever. I get propane refills all the time from this location and even if there were some place closer, I'd still go to them. It really makes a difference when you care. Thank you!

Always love the smell as I sit and wait for order Togo inside the restaurant. Night time is not as busy so you don't have to wait long. The wait is worth it!

It's been a long, long, long time. Tried it out again and still disappointed. If you can't even melt the cheese all way, how's the food supposed to taste properly? The best part about my Pizza Hut experience , was the driver. He was nice and courteous. At least I know where not to order cheap pizza from

Between services and nearby. La Cana loaded up has never done me wrong. Still didn't disappoint even 10 years later. Thank you again! Friendly staff and now has a bar inside

A lesser star should be given if I could, but it's worth it to me to let anyone know who reviews typed Yelp reviews, what they can expect from this establishment. Seriously wtf!? How are you an establishment that has been serving food for decades and you serve me cold fries and soggy fish? Your fries come with everything! You didn't even try. All I wanted ( after telling my gf how great you were), was the nostalgic memory of what I have eaten since childhood and you have ruined it. If there was a "win" for failing at frying French fries, Petes Fish and (soggy cold) Chips, would be raining champ. I will never eat here again and I definitely be letting everyone I know, know about it. I'm definitely scraping of my "I love Petes Fish and Chips" sticker off my bumper as well. Btw, not the first time this has happened, was hoping you were having an off day. Flavored garbage is what I'd call the "food" here. Sorry to see you go down the tubes

Is pizza supposed to be so oily? I can't believe this company gets away with the food that is served. Been here 3 times and won't be back again. Ever. Or tell anyone to go here. I like to give any place a minimum of 3 try's,(maybe there was an off day in the kitchen, my sever was having a bad day, or the bar was not able to provide a good drink nor customer service). I am not quick to judge but when I come in again after previous negative experiences, I will write a review for sure.   My history with pizza has never had such a low point. No actual flavor, except oil and even greaser cheese, which I don't know how is possible, but it happened, and a greasy crust, and the thing is that it was supposed to be some sort of baked potato with fixings as toppings but turned out to be a waste of my time and money. I know this particular pizza is an oil base instead of a red sauce, but seriously, I shouldn't be able to squeeze oil out of a pizza slice. Have you ever? May have well as brought out a garbage can and told me to eat out of it. There would have been more flavor at least. I don't know how they have been in business these years and I feel they are just panning to the lowest common denominator of clientele... Fail Mellow Mushroom. Absolute fail on multiple occasions

Since all good Chinese food places are closed on Sundays, we tried, hopeful, to have some good Chinese food from this place, and was sadly disappointed. Service was was nice and fast for delivery, which is the what the one star is for, and that is all the good things I have to say. I ordered a chicken dish, crab puffs, and a few other full dishes and all had one similarity...they were all bland and full of vegetables. The crab puffs had the smallest amount of filling inside, with a large gap of what should be full of said filling, and overall, the taste was this fried, oily, wonton wrap. The chicken dish I ordered had maybe 2 oz. of chicken, (thigh and leg meat only with fat skin still on it and this grey tint that was just unappetizing), and did I say I've never felt like more of a vegan until this meal? Because of the overwhelming amount of vegetables? (nothing against vegans or any one who diets, I eat it all). I'd love to have a Sunday Asian food restaurant I order from, and be satisfied with what I get, but this is not that place. I am only one person, but Good luck to you Lucky Kitchen in your future business.

Breakfast burritos all day! Would like to have double corn tortillas for the tacos though. They just fall apart with one tortilla, but still great food cooked to order.

If there were a lower rating, I'd post it. Food=terrible Service=terrible  General Rating= something lower than 1 star  Convenience is the only factor keeping fast food chains like this alive. The awful food produced, and equally terrible service at any location, are only part of the reason why I do not go to drive thru. I've seen the videos on "pink slime" and all videos alike about McDonald's, but that's just a media ploy. I could rant on but I think you get the point. If you like living, change your diet and deal with a grumbly stomach rather than put up with the stress and disappointment of the "drive-thru" world. Absolutely have lost faith
