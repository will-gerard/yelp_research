Ohh la la! This place made me want to learn French. I went there with my bro and sis- in laws as well as my mother in law and my husband. We each brought in our own bottle of wine. I love BYOBs because you can really splurge on your food AND drink delicious wines. This place did the trick! We had the Interested Cheeses (my sis-in-law and I love cheese) and the Filet Mignon taco for starters. I can't vouch for the tacos, but I think my husband would have fought me for it.   For our entrees I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! I even ended up eating off other plates with salmon after they were full I loved it so much! My husband loved the Filet Mignon as well. I do think it was here where he discovered he really did like salmon.   Of course, we had to have dessert, too! We got the chocolate mocha and the four berry tartes. Even if you are full, get a tarte to go!   I really want to go back to try the farfalle..Maybe this weekend??  I guess it is good for groups but call ahead. Its a tight squeeze!

I take my little pooch to the Petsmart Hotel here when we absolutely have to board him. He seems to love it! He always enters and leaves lookig pretty happy! The rooms are big enough and you can see into the boarding room and I liked that so that I could see that is clean and roomy enough for him! They offer so many options for them while they are staying that it is a lot like camp! Even though we try to take him with us as much as possible, this is the place I take him when we are away!  I have to only give it four starts though because I agree one one writer...not much of a selection of items!

I take my 9 month old to Hubbard and we LOVE it! I feel so comfortable with the staff and it not only teaches him how to be comfortable with the water, but also teaches my husband and me how to take what he learns and apply it at home in the tub or even in the pool. The staff makes it fun with games and songs and the parents learn the right words to prepare babies to hold their breath when going under water. I think swim lessons are a must for kids here in AZ since almost everyone has a pool. And it's so great to see their progress!

I'm writing this regarding their post-redesign. I'm not sure they kept the same staff from before, but with this economy, I'm sure they can get better workers. I went in one Sunday morning to grab a quick breakfast for my husband and me. The line wasn't long, but it was SLOW! They had about 8 people working behind a small counter which only created chaos. When I did finally get to order my food, I ordered 2 vanilla coffees. I got my 2 sandwiches and 1 coffee. As the guy handed me my coffee, he announced to the world that he was "going on break now" and set my other coffee cup down and walked away. As he was about to cross the counter I asked what he did with my other coffee. His reply was "uh, I don't know, its my break time". Seriously? I polietly said it wasn't breaktime until I got my coffee.   My husband and inlaws went in not too long afterwards and got about the same service. They were sitting inside at a table and one of the workers came in with his motorcycle gear on and sat his helmet down on THEIR table and then proceeded to change into his DD shirt. They said it was a mess. Even worse , the franchise owner was there that same day and let all this happen.   The coffee is good, but I'm also paying for the service.

Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei.   I was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.  After we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!

I can only comment on two of the smoothies because I am on a banana kick and I choose from one of the two: the Bananrama or the Peanut Butter Chocolate. Oh so good! And now they do offer more than one size!  I have started getting this for dinner versus food! I love it!

Unless, you are a history buff and would like to find some cool facts about FDR, taking a kid to this park will probably be a must. Kids and trains go hand in hand. We started taking our son here way before he turned a year old and we ended up having his 1st birthday party here. There is the train and the caroseul and a cool little place to get ice cream and toy trains. I really do like it for parties or picnics because the park is large enough to accomodate extras such as a petting zoo or inflatable bounce houses.   If you like history, you have to check out the railroad cars set up. One is the actual Presidential car that FDR used and the tour guides there can provide a lot of insider information on the life of FDR. The first time I visited the train park, I think I spend most of my time speaking to one of the guide. Very interesting!

5 stars isn't enough for this awesome pediatric center! My son's primary doctor is Dr. Sotelo, but I've spoke to all of the doctors here and I couldn't be more happy with trusting my son's health in their care! I've never had a moment where I know I could call and never get a call back or get a call or advice I couldn't trust. They put my new mom jitters at ease immediately! Most of my friends use this office, also, and we all gush about the great care they show towards you and your child. It's nice to have someone ask how the mom is doing after a new child, so they take care of the parents, also! They are a fantastic office!! The whole staff!! A++++

I went here for a meeting a few weeks ago and from the moment I got there, I could tell the staff wanted to be anywhere but at work that morning. Maybe it was also the company I was there with, but I felt like I should be about 80 to enjoy. Not that there is anything wrong with being 80, but I don't need to feel that way, yet! I ordered a Cesear salad because there's not a lot of vegetarian dishes. It was blah. Nothing to write home about. Like others have said, I got out of there paying $20, but I got a sad salad and a diet coke. It's on a lake, cute, but it's not a place I will go back to.

I love this place. I recently got back into shooting after years of not living in rural America. It's hard to find time to get to a range with a 21 month old, but my husband pushed me out the door and said he would be Mr. Mom for 3 hours while I was there. I took the Ladies of Liberty course, which I suggest if 1. you have never used a gun 2. it has been a while since you have shot a gun 3. you have your own gun that you would like to learn a little more about.  Their instructors are great and helpful and I really enjoyed the class portion of the course as a refresher.  For the last hour, we were on the range. This course includes .22 rentals and all the ammo you can shoot in an hour's time.You can bring in your own gun and ammo if you wish and the instructor will spend time talking to you about it and how to use.   It's great for me becuase I've made some other lady friends that I meet up with or when my dad or brother come into town, I can take them there, too. Heading there Monday!

After living in Chicago, I know what good pizza is, so I'm a picky pizza person (try saying that 3 times fast). But, I do go here for the pasta. I get cravings for the Bolla Pasta with meat sause. It is so good! I also like to go there during the day for their wings. I think its just their atomosphere. Yes, the wait can be a little long, but if you are around and hungry at a random time ( like yesterday we went at 3:30) then you are seated right away. The staff is super nice and they really like their jobs so you aren't getting grumpy servers who you feel you have to tip. Our parents like to go here when they visit for the food and music.   Haven't tried the cookie dessert yet, but I'm almost there!

Met some friends here after a trip to the library and this was the first time I had been there. They have a great selection of entrees, both lunch and breakfast. Loved the uniqueness of the food selections. Interesting combos!  The sandwiches are huge and filling, so if you do not get a side to go along, the sandwich alone does the trick! We sat inside and bought along 3 babies, so it was kinds tight with the strollers, car seats. They don't have high chairs, so our next visit will probably be outdoor seating. But, hey, when a place offers outdoor seating here in the Valley..TAKE IT! I'll be going back!

Wow! Totally impressed with this academy. After my last hair gal moved from AZ, I gave the academy a call and they got me in on a Saturday. I grabbed a photo that I wanted along with color ideas and off I went. The girl I had was fabulous! She had been there for about 4 months and I didn't mind at all when she would ask the instructor for help! The color turned out great and the cut turned out way better than the photo I brought in! Since the instructors have to approve all their work, you can't go wrong. So, cut, color, highlights only cost me $55 and its one of the best cuts I have ever had!

--Only vouching for the breakfast!--  I like to take friends in town here for brunch because most of my friends visit from Chicago and its nice to take them to the mountain and sit and enjoy the view. Its a peaceful way to have breakfast and its not too bad of a price. Two of my favorite entrees are the bagel and lox and the oh so dreamy banana chocolate beglein waffles. My friend and I liked the waffles so much that we tried to recreate them the next day. It didn't work as well as we thought it would.   If there are only two of you going, definately call ahead and see if you can get a booth facing the window. Its breathtaking!

Our little family went here for lunch on a Sunday. We go there before the lunch crowd and we were totally digging the scenery. We sat in the closed in patio over looking the golf course. My husband has played the course a few times which started a conversation about moving to a golf course. That's another story...  We went hoping for a brunch, but all the items on the menu (even weekends) are lunch/dinner items. However, the special for the day was bananas foster waffles. We both go that and, oh my goodness, was it good!!!  I didn't eat again until late that night and it put us both in a food coma. The orange syurp was amazing and everything went so well together!   The downfall was our mimosas were about the same price as our entrees, so our total bill was $60 for breakfast. However, I do get to go back in a couple of weeks for a reception with some fellow alumni, so I am happy to know I will be trying other foods there also!

Ok, my review is for their lunch only because I used to go there quite a bit for their lunch specials. Its ideal if you want to get good food for a good price on your lunch break. Their Mr. Pinks pasta and salad combo is just the right amount for lunch. The wedge salad is great if you are looking for something on the lighter side. Sitting inside or outside is great and you will probably hear a little Frank Sinatra before heading back to work. The staff is very nice, friendly, and quick!

I recently hosted an alumni event here and they did a wonderful job of accommodaing us! Katie, the manager, was very helpful even though it was pretty busy.  A lot of televisons makes it great to go and watch games. A very nice bar area, however, I do wish they had more beer selections. Kid friendly, too, which is key. Great place to host an event. Hoping we go there every week!

I love going to breakfast on weekends. I actually live for it and I've been going to Kashman's for about 4 years now. (Wow, has it really been that long!) After reading some of the reviews, yes - it is a little expensive for breakfast and yes- the food is normal breakfast food, but I love that it is a small little breakfast, brunch, lunch joint. I mostly love it because it is one of the few places that I know that welcomes pets! I feel so guilty some mornings getting up and leaving my little pooch that it is nice to have a place I can take him. Of course there is outdoor seating and it is a great way to start out your day. We usually see a lot of people come in after their morning hike. Some meals are big enough to share as well...although I don't.  :-)

I've been here on several occassions. Once with work, once with couples, and twice as a girls night out celebration. Each time I thought the food was simply amazing! Each time I have been, there has been an average of 8 people at the table and as long as we ordered two of each entree, I felt there was plenty of food to go around. The butterfish is mainly the whole reason to go. I became a vegetarian about 3 months after my first visit and it is so tough to have to pass on that when I go back! The calamari salad is unique because it has a hint of plantans in it so as you are eating, you taste the sweetnes of it and it has most people going "what was that I just tasted?" With a smile on their face, of course! I'm also a fan of the tofu tempera.  BTW, if you ever get a craving for their dishes, but don't want to make a reservation, you can order food to go.   As for the drinks, beware! They sneak up on you!   I think it is best to eat there in a group. That way you get to sample more of the entrees. The average price I have spent is about $70/pp. That includes 2-3 drinks, entrees with about 8 people.  The downfall was the valet. I guess that is technically the Mondrians fault, but the guy had quiet and attitude. Called the manager the next day. I don't think he is there anymore.

At One Yoga took my level of practice up a notch. The number of classes a week and the times makes it easy for anyone to work into their weekly schedule. The different types of classes gets me in the door no matter how I feel that day. If I'm tired, the basic class is perfect or if I feel like I am wanting to challenge myself with a new pose, the power or Astanga class makes me feel like I have accomplished a pratice. I also see quick results with the workout. The teachers are fantasic and are willing to help you with poses. I love it there!

Due to this pregnancy, I've given up my vegetarian ways so this baby can have some extra protein! I should have known as soon as I was craving cheeseburgers, he was a boy!   I work about two blocks from here and some co-workers decided to go here for lunch one day. Cheeseburgers and milkshakes? Count me in!  I love this place! Very 50-ish with the counter and barstools. The cheeseburgers are to die for! I mean it! And they give you a heaping of fries! They also have sweet tea here, which is a bonus for me. The orders are so quick! Granted, you do come out feeling as if you can't eat again for days, but it is so worth it! Good thing there isn't one by my house or else, I would eat there more often than I do!  Definately recommend!

I get up on the weekends and the first thing out of my mouth is "Can we go to Kashman's?" The only reason I am giving it four starts versus 5 is that it is mostly outside seating. Now, for 1/2 of the year here, that is perfect, but for the summers, its just too hot!   There's a lot of food that comes with your order. The omletts are delicious, though! My husband comes out just for the coffee. While I always get the breakfast, he has ventured out and tried a few of the sandwiches, which he liked as well, but said he liked the breakfast more.   Best thing about it is that pooch lovers get to bring their furry best friends along. I bring my poodle every time and he shares a breakfast. I don't feel guilty about leaving him at home.   Great, friendly staff, too!

Hoping to grab a quick breakfast meal before running errands this morning, all of our usual breakfast joints were packed and we just happen to stumble on Dilly's being open for breakfast. They had a little breakfast selection as my husband got the breakfast burrito and I decided to go for the veggie sandwich. My sandwich was awesome! It was nice to have a sandwich that sort of mixed up the norm. Lovely blend of sprouts, tomatos, lettuce, cream cheese (I'm trying to go vegan, but the cream cheese was a wonderful compliment) on fresh multi-grain bread. Add with it the fruit salad and it was a very filling breakfast.   I'll go back for sure. Although, I liked it for a sandwich place, it's not going to be a place I crave, but the next time I stop in I'm sure I will still like what I order.

I grew up going to races in NC (ahem, the land of Richard Petty), so I wasn't sure what to expect when I got tickets for the Subway 500. My husband had never been to a NASCAR race, so I was excited to take him. It can be an all day experience, if not all weekend, so I was worried when we left at 11:15 if we would make it in time. It took just 35 minutes to get there from North Phoenix and FREE parking. I was impressed with how easy it was to park and get into the gates. We had our earplugs, food, drinks and in our seats by 12:15. As long as you are seated in rows 25 or above, I don't think there is a bad seat. Next time, we will bring scanner headsets, but if you don't have them people are nice enough to tell you what's going on if there is a wreck. Next time I'd like to get the Pit Passes. My husband loved it, too! He's already talking about going in November. It's a small track, can't really compare it to Charlotte, Daytona, but it was better than I expected!  Btw, if you are going to bring your child (I wouldn't recommend any child under 3 or 4), I would recommend earphones that fit their ears or head or the wax drops. I saw one kid who couldn't get his earplugs to work and he looked miserable with the sound. It's loud!

Ok, I just had lunch there. The place is clean and the staff is friendly, but most of all, I am paying for my food, right?   Maybe I've been spoiled by the Pear Gorganzola salad at the one on Tatum, but I wasn't pleased with my pizza/salad combo today at this one.   The garden salad was actually a lettuce salad with two tomatoes. It was weak. The pizza wasn't as organic tasting as I had hoped for. I was hoping for that fresh taste, but I got a Dominos taste. Disappointed. Maybe I should just stick to the Pear Gorganzola salad. Infact, I am craving that now!

Now I know why they have a 5 star rating on here. We woke up to a mini flood in our hallway last week and being so close to the holidays, I didn't think we could get it all handled without a lot of time and money. I found their reviews on Yelp and gave them a call. Brandon was here in a matter of minutes, immediately found the problem and fixed it. As i was on the phone with our insurance trying to get water restoration companies to handle the water and dry it out, Brandon already called his guy at Service 1 and they were here before Brandon left. I like that Brandon came in, fixed the problem and never gave us the run around on quotes and pricing. They are an honest company and that's just what we needed! Very impressed with their services!

This place is close to my house and I usually go on a Saturday morning. I've been going for almost a year, however, the past few times I have been, before I even make it to my car my nails are ruined. Also, there are times on Saturday monrings when I feel rushed or if I pay for a special pedicure, I don't feel like I am getting the whole experience. So yesterday when I needed a pedicure and eyebrow wax asap, I was trying to think of other places in the area to go to. I knew places would be closing soon, so I headed over. I think it was a sign to meet Nancy.  Although Nancy said she is only off on Mondays, I've never had her as a technician. She was great! Although they were closing, I didn't feel rushed, I could actually sit and relax! She also did a fantastic job with my eyebrows. I made a point to ask her schedule and although I've never asked for a particular technician before, I will now.  ASK FOR NANCY!

I'm agreeing with Aletheia on this one. This Joann's is a lot like every Joann's I have been to (except at the one on Cave Creek and Catus, which is a little smaller, but had what I needed when the Tatum one didn't).  The Joann's employees here walk around like zombies. If they do not like their jobs at all, then get a new one! I was here yesterday and was looking for a certain product when I stopped an employee. The conversations went like this:  Me: Excuse me, I am looking for this particular iron on that I see you carry, but it is out of stock. Do you have more items in the back?  Her: No, that's all we have  Me: Ok, then can you tell me where the next closest Joann's is so that I can try that location  Her: No, I've only lived in Arizona so I'm not sure. But, ask that lady over there.  What?? "I've only lived in Arizona." That was her answer. I had no intentions of going to another state for this iron on. What was she thinking?  Then I go to check out. I asked the cashier guy "do you know where the closest other Joann's is?" The guy goes "I don't know, I don't shop here"  I don't care if you don't shop here! You work here and it is your job to answer my question! I work with people, too, and when they ask me a question I don't know, I don't say "I don't know, I don't read this magazine." Then he followed up with "I wish people would stop coming in here because its too busy" I just said, be glad you have a job.   Thank goodness I'm not so crafty that I would have to shop here often!

I enjoy coming to the Food Bar for lunch. Their vegetable sandwich is amazing and is huge! Its completely filling and the veggies are cooked perfectly! The guy that makes the coffee is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. If you walk in the resturant in a bad mood, he will make you smile. He also makes a great peanut butter smoothie!

We stopped in here today while out running errands all over town. We weren't all that hungry, but I've been wanting to go here for awhile and really didn't know when I would be near here again. My husband was game for going. This place is like it should belong on a beach somewhere. It's small...no tables, just barstools, maybe 8 total with a few tables outside. I'm a vegetarian so I went with the Veggie Sandwich. My husband did the bacon cheddar hot dog. Of course, we did the meal deal. $5..can't beat it!   My sandwich was so good!! I was thinking it would be a veggie burger or something similar, but it was eggplant with sauteed mushrooms and onions. I have no idea what everything was sauteed in, but it was amazing! Had a sweet taste to it. My husband said he could taste the charbroiledness in the hotdog and it was loaded with bacon and cheddar!   The place is just a cool place all around. Good food and good prices, you just can't beat it. I like places are just a little different than the rest and this place is just that!  So, maybe I will be running errands on that side of town more often.  I'm giving it 5 stars, just because it was above and beyond what I expected.

Z'Tejas is one of those places (for me, at least) that I totally forget about until someone says "hey, what about going to Z'Tejeas?" Then, I remember "ohhh the margaritas!!:   This past Saturday night, this is just what happened! Living only a mile from the Phoenix Open, there wasn't a place around with less than a 90 minute wait and some friends and I were starving. One friend reminded us of Z's and they got us in for a table of 7 quickly. No apps were needed as we devoured the cornbread. Even my little baby boy gobbled some up, too!  I got the wild mushroom enchailada and a pomogrante margarita. DE-LISH! I devoured it all! Then, I ordered margarita numbero dos. For someone who doesn't consume a lot of alcohol, I became Miss Chatty Cathy. But, I like this place a lot. There can be a lot of people there, but you don't feel crowded because the seating is nicely spaced. I've even sat at the bar seating before and never felt like anyone was in my personal space.   Now, I have just got to remember to think of it when going to dinner.

I'm not a Sox or Dodgers fan, but we like baseball and when taking an almost 2 year old to a baseball game, it helps when even the lawn isn't packed. We went to a Sox game today with friends and sat in the lawn and had a great time. No lines for restrooms, clean, great for kids. Just bring a blanket and sunscreen and enjoy. Parking is on premisis and free.

This company is OUTSTANDING! I have completely switched dog groomers due to this clean, green mobile grooming staff and services! I have a mini poodle and have found it difficult to find a groomer that can cut his hair without making him look too girly. This place cuts it perfectly! And the best thing..They come to you! You don't even have to leave your house! So, instead of me spending time driving to and from the groomers, all I have to do is open the front door! Also, their prodcuts are clean and organic, so you know everything is safe for your pet. I actually took a peep inside the groomer station today and everything is spotless! The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied with their services. I know my pooch feels clean and so much better afterwards!  Also, their prices are just like any other groomer! So, for anyone who thinks they may be pricer due to them coming to you, nope, just the same!  Love, love, love!

I have a very active 20 month old who doesn't get tired before 9:30 every night, so my husband and I are always finding ways to expend that energy. We recently enrolled him in Soccer Tots at the City North location and we love it! Some may think that teaching a child that young a sport is crazy, but I was surprised myself at how quickly he and the other kids were picking up some of the basics. The instructor incorporates other items such as balloons and noodles to learn control. There is also a fun obstacle course at the end of class where the kids can run through hoops and jump and kick a soccer ball through the net. The class consists of parent involvment, too, so it is a great way to spend time with your child. I'm so glad we found an activity like this! He even goes to bed early on Tuesdays now!

After moving where a Starbucks isn't in walking distance, we found Matador's Coffee that is close enough for a Sunday stroll. It's nice and cozy and had a lot of things to choose from for breakfast, brunch or lunch! I've been trying out different iced lattes and coffees and all have been great! The sandwiches are made after you order so nothing is just put in a microwave. The pasta salad is great, too!! My husband ordered it once and I ended up devouring it. Nice sized portions. Has both indoor and outdoor seating, which is great because I don't like to leave my little pooch at home!
