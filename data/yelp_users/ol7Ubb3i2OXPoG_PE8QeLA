I've been here twice now with a buddy. The place is a dump but the Mexican food is the best in the valley. I recommend it to everyone but I also recommend you get there before 10:30am because this place gets packed! Red burro enchilada style with 1 beef taco. Sooooo good.

I've always had a great experience with Firestone. Knowledgable and very friendly. If you have a chance, work with Darryl. He is top notch and will take great care of you.

Adopted my 4 month old Pit mix from here. They are very nice and easy to deal with. The doggy is very healthy and her check-ups are free! I am very pleased.

Last night we were "those people", walking in 30 minutes before they closed. Our waiter was very prompt and didn't act like us coming in so late was an issue at all. We ordered at large pizza with Roma tomatoes, garlic and spicy chicken sausage. It was so good! The pizza was perfectly cooked and the spicy chicken sausage had an amazing flavor to it. We ordered, ate and drank in about 20 minutes being courteous to them closing and had a great experience. I would go back for sure. It's a little pricey but well worth it.

I go here a lot and always get great food. I usually get the chicken shawarma or the beef gyro and iced tea. The food is fantastic and the servers are usually prompt. I would recommend to anyone.

Although I haven't been back to O&I, I was contacted by a fox rep and they were very courteous and made things right after my bad experience. I go to Blanco and Culinary Dropout frequently and will probably try North this time around. Thanks FOX!

I used to have to wine and dine customers and would always take them to Mucho Gusto.The food is a fancy twist on traditional Mexican food and the quality is amazing. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the service is kind of slow. I would recommend for sure.

Every year for mothers day I go with my family to Joe's. This place is the only eatery I can think of that is worth a 20-30 minute wait. Most of the produce is grown on the farm and the food is amazing. I would recommend to anyone.

I really like this place. The place doesn't look all that appealing but the food is great. My daughters and I usually get teriyaki chicken, corn and macaroni salad and it is pretty spot on to Hawaiian dishes. I wish they had Kailua pork more often but it's no big deal. Stop in if you want something tasty and cheap.

Booked the rental through Autoslash.com. The quote was for $88.00 including taxes for 3 days which was a screaming deal.  I read all of the horrible reviews on Yelp so I was pretty worried when picking up my rental at the airport for my trip up to Sedona. I got there about 30 minutes early and the guy that helped me said they only had cars on the lot that were available. I booked an intermediate SUV so I told him that's BS. In between texting people on his personal phone he called down to the garage and found a Hyundai Sonata that I could take at a higher rate of $139.00 out the door. Why they considered a Sonata a full size beats me but I was kind of desperate so I took it. There is also a "mandatory" 350.00 deposit to rent the car which was lame but not a deal breaker. I declined all of the extra insurances and had to provide my insurance card which was fine. My State Farm insurance card doesn't have my address so he asked for a utility bill. Luckily, I read other reviews on Yelp so I had one in my back pocket... the Sonata was in perfect condition and drove great there and back so no problems there. When returning the car it took forever and there was no organization to any of it; you just stand around and hope that the one person they have working doesn't skip you and help other people out. They said it could take up to 14 days to get my deposit back... I got mine back in 3 days.  More of a hassle than it is worth.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of how clean the vehicle was.

I come to this Barros about twice a month. For the price the pizza is great! My kids love it too because there is a kid area with games and a tv showing kid shows. Is it the best pie in town? No. But it's great for the price and family atmosphere.

Pretty cool place. Bar, pool and Foosball and dancing for the ladies. The price was a little expensive but it was nice playing pool with my buddies while the girls were off dancing across the room. I would go again for sure.

Frenchys was awesome! The Chicago dog tasted authentic and the dude running it was super nice who I think may have been frenchy. They took a card too which was sweet because I had no cash. If I see these dudes around again, I'll be ordering some dogs!

The pizzas are amazing and very creative. You may have to tell them to go easy on the "char" because they have almost burned a few pizzas but I would recommend. Their wings on the appetizer menu are real tasty.

Overall I was really impressed. We just ordered off of the Sushi menu. It was super fresh and hit the spot. Our waitress was attentive and seemed like a cool person that cared about our table. Saki bomb with Sapporo, always a good choice. The only think that was a little "meh" was the decor. Looks out dated and too orange. I would go back for sure, though.

I'm kind of a regular there now so I may be a little biased but I like RockBar a lot. Cassie and Nima are great bartenders and there is just a fun and uplifting vibe there. I'm not a big fan of the bands that are brought in but watched a ton of football games there, played bean bags and just had a sweet time.

This truck was parked outside my office yesterday so I went to check it out. I got the Gangsta Grilled cheese. I've got to say, it was delicious! I though it could use more meat; I only had a little piece in my whole grilled cheese but the flavors were fantastic. Nice work.

I've been to this location 4 or 5 times and even though the "light is on", they still give you stale ass doughnuts. I went today and the same thing happened but my fiance didn't want me to complain. The woman behind me did complain about the doughnuts being old even though they were coming down the conveyor belt but the employees acted like the customer was crazy for wanting them hot and fresh... The KK in Mesa is awesome; I'll never go to this one again.

They get shipments of already cooked doughnuts and just glaze them there. Fake doughnuts!

I gave Shaving Grace a shot on a whim due to another plan falling through. This place is awesome! I've never been to New York and have no experience with the mafia but this place has that cool 1920s feel to it. Everyone that works there makes you feel like you been their friend for ages and my haircut and a shave were top notch. My only complaint? They need some LA Dodgers swag in there!

I wish I could say I like this place but I really don't. Last night was the 2nd time I went there and from what I had remembered from the first time it was terrible service and mediocre food. Last night was no different... We were there on a Monday night at 5pm and there were only about 6 other people there. I know that doesn't matter too much but you think the service would be spot on. We were served by an older guy that stopped buy our table every 15-20 minutes and had so many cheesy jokes it was hard to humor him. I got the beef brisket and it wasn't terrible but there were pieces off meat that were about 90% fat. The potato salad was some crap I could buy in the deli at Frys. Entrees came out at different times so we were all waiting for everyone to have their food. Avoid this rathole.

This truck was parked out in front of our office today. I ordered the bahn mi and my buddy got the pot stickers. He made a remark about how the pot stickers bag that you could see through the window were the same kind as the ones he bought at Costco frozen. As far as my sandwich, it was meh. The bread was mushy, not soggy but not really toasted, the pickled vegetables were decent but the chicken had no flavor at all.  Overall it wasn't that great but I ate it all. Probably would try something different next time. I regret not getting more Sriracha because that was the only flavor it really had.

I live in Scottsdale and went out of town to Southern California for 4 days and booked this rental. The price was $116.00 total and I got there at 6 am on a Thursday so there was no line. The woman was nice and didn't try to up-sell me AT ALL. I didnt have a credit card so I had to put down a $400.00 deposit which was annoying but manageable. Brand new Chevy Malibu with 4900 miles which ran great. Brought it back at 3pm on Sunday with no line. Overall, I was pretty impressed. Last time we took a trip to Sedona and used Payless at the airport and it was horrid. I would rent again from Fox.

This sushi restaurant is the dive bar of restaurants. Where do I start? The decor is terrible and its built inside of an old fast food restaurant. They say they have a full bar but I think they hide all of the booze in the back and don't really know what liquor they have. Not sure if they have a liquor license or not. I asked for a rum and coke, 10 minutes later the nice waiter came back and said they only have Pepsi. Who drinks a rum and Pepsi? Lol, I did and it was terrible. They have one speaker overhead and it is bumping gangster rap with all of the expletives. Something I'm down for listening to in my car or at home but in a sushi joint? C'mon! The sushi wasn't bad but the quality was on par with what you'd get from a Sprouts deli. There is no reason to go here; please save your money...

What a great concept! I had two chicken drumsticks with the Thai slaw and a plain doughnut. First off the skin on the chicken is cooked perfectly, doused in sauce but still crispy. The meat was so tender and the doughnut was perfect for sopping up the drumstick sauce. All in all it was a little expensive but well worth it. Please check it out and get there at 10:20 before the line goes out the door.
