For the love of all that is good and right in the world, why do all of their employees seem to be confused as to the reason they are behind the counter.  Nobody ever seems to know who should be helping customers, and they are almost always busy with other tasks like trying to look busy with other tasks.  I rarely walk out of there not feeling like I rudely interrupted some very important task and I had the nerve to ask them to make me a salad.  They are close and sometimes I just really like the feeling of being unwanted, you know.  It's the warm fuzzy feeling you get when someone despises you for asking them to do their job.

Since I've now been here 3 times, I feel that I can comment on the quality and consistency of my new favorite nail salon in central Phoenix. I have been going to the same nail salon for years, and it has always been hit and miss. When it closed for remodeling, I decided it was time to try somewhere else, and I am so glad that I did.   There is nothing that I do not like about this place, and I have been thrilled with my results each time. The biggest thing to note is that I have had a different technician each time, and I have been happy each time. They have a large selection of colors, and they are kept separated by brand and color. This is a nice touch. The pedicure choices feel spa like, and their gel color choices are better than I have seen anywhere else in terms of color and brand selection. I will not be back to my former salon.   Total for a deluxe pedicure, which includes callous remover, paraffin wax, and hot stone massage, AND gel manicure, including shoulder massage, was $65.

I stopped by today to pick up dinner for a friend who just had a baby. One of the owners helped me with each selection, and my friend texted me to say that this was the best meal her family had in a long time.   Stock was running low at 4:00pm, but the staff and owners are great.

The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived, but  we "waited to be seated" for about 5 minutes before one of us went to find someone to help us.     The food was great. Everyone at our table enjoyed what we ordered.  If we had ordered takeout, this would be a four star review. We ordered two different appetizers, four different empanadas and a dessert empanada. There weren't any real complaints about the food.        We did not enjoy that the entire process took over an hour. The other comments about waiting are no exaggeration. The empty restaurant had a line out the door by the time we left. There is no way the staff was prepared for this when they couldn't handle our table of four.   Total bill was $60 including tip.  2 appetizers 6 savory empanadas 3 dessert empanadas 1 Pepsi

You will not find a more caring, dedicated owner than Scott.  He is an excellent teacher.
