One star for my manicure, seeing has this is the worst..you know, EVER.    When she plopped the glitter polish on, I realized it was not what I wanted--yet, three seconds later, all 10 fingers were glittered.  Manicure took 12 minutes total and included a scolding for turning my head to speak.  I'm guessing no extra charge for that.  I would've asked for some corrections, however, the list was so long it would just mean a full redo.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  One star for my crew's gorgeous pedicures they received and lovely ambiance.   Staff attitude was awkward.  Next time:  PASS.

I went in with my two friends and their twin babies.  You know what that means, right?!  We were a high needs table, but the crew at Joe's didn't hesitate to make sure all our needs were met-from beginning to end!  Before my pals arrived I had sat at the bar and ordered a Strawberry Peach Sangria.  That cocktail is super good without being overwhelmingly sweet!  Very well done!  Both bartenders, Joe and another gal, worked as a team to make sure all bar sitters were taken care of.  They were uber-friendly, too, which is unusual and really awesome for bartender service.  You know how usually they are faaarrrr too busy to engage for more than your order?  Nope, not here.  Management has an eye for good people.  Once we were all seated with the babies in tow, we had a super cool server (Cherise?  She was short and spunky with glamorous artsy tats) that made sure we had everything we needed.  She made some good suggestions---I ended up getting the crab appetizer and the shrimp caesar salad.  They were both really good, but you MUST eat the appetizer slowly unless you want to tear up the roof of your mouth.  (Why, oh, why must some of the tastiest foods do this?  Captain Crunch Berries...THOSE BASTARDS!)  I'd also opt for dressing on the side next time, but all in all, these were great choices.  The service environment is superb here, lots of lively young folks that seem genuinely nice.  Pair that with tasty seafood and you've got a winner!

Very pricey, but very good.  I suggest having a welcoming stomach, your hangover may prevent you from enjoying it to the extent that it costs.

The Hyatt Place is actually one of my favorite hotels.  This one is in a great location-next to Walmart, Bass Pro Shop, Chilis, Cracker and Barrel and a ton more.  The rooms are big, open, and the whole theme is a bold modern clean.  I am in favor of staying here but there's a few things they could step up.  The complimentary breakfast involves bitter fruit, stale bagels, and that kind of bread that resembles cheap stock toilet paper.  There are hot breakfast sandwiches that seem to be a simple and popular choice-though I can't say since I passed (not a fan of egg).  Ill just say its fine if you're too lazy to step around the block but if you want some good fare-be ready to do so.  I had another food disappointment our first night; I ordered chicken tortilla soup and was told it'd be 3-5 minutes. 15 minutes later I got chicken noodle soup with two tortilla CHIPS planted on the top.  I was too fatigued to combat the issue since it wasn't an error, I was the only person, the only order, and the chips were a clear indication that the mock soup was delivered in the hopes it wouldn't be an issue.  On the bright side, the chicken noodle was pretty good!  The housekeeping staff is really friendly! The front desk staff is absurdly robot-friendly, which is certainly preferred vs attitude or surly folks.  On our 3rd day here I had the bacon-cheddar burger, and it was awesome.  All in all, a great stay with a few misses on the food.  Also, put-put in the back!  LOVE IT!
