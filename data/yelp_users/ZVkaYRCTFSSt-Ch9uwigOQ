If you are reading this please don't go there. They made the place not appealing to eat in. The mean changed from great to worst. I got the spicy pei Wei they asked me if I wanted a large or market size, so I got the large and it looked no different from the market size i went up to tall them i got the large one they said its only 2oz difference which was not worth the 3 bucks more because there wasn't two more ounces. Don't go trust me the food wasn't that good either.

Not a place I would recommend to anybody. I was very disappointed in how this place was dirty all around especially the chairs and tables were not wiped down what a joke.  The employment and management are very unprofessional no people skills at all very rude and short with people. If I could I would give this place negative stars not even one. It's not worth your money go do a party for the kids somewhere else trust me this is not the place. I'm just very upset at employment and management unbelievable how unprofessional some places can be very rude to my family and friends.

I really love the fact of the unlimited variety of meat you can eat and the salad bar. Great big atmosphere.  I enjoy it every time I go there.

Great waiter great professionalism.  The experience was awesome to try but to me this place is like a once in a blue moon not one of those places I would go to often. But an awesome first experience if you have never been there!

I love going for wings here best that I had from any where in town. There other food menu is a okay I didn't have a chance to try it all yet but I will one day so I'll be back. The TVs all over the place are great something different all the time when waiting for food or eating you are entertained.

Only giving it one star because wasn't  happy with the way they made my breakfast burrito wasn't worth the money they were charging. I got a egg and cheese burrito which I get all the time depending on what place I go. They cooked my eggs in the microwave which I did not like at all but I didn't say anything  because it didn't look like they would do it any other way. Also wasn't  rolled up to its best to keep the eggs from falling out. But I would go back there to try there bagels. looks like that's what they're known for I just wouldn't ever get the breakfast burrito there ever again.

Enjoyed the setting and the surrounding pretty good food. They were way understaffed that day but I understand how it goes in the restaurant business so that wasn't a big deal. So all in all for a kosher restaurant they did pretty well

Walking into this place looks nice and well kept. I liked the setup they have. I'm giving this place five star rating not for how nice and casual it is but for the food. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I will that's my plan in the near future. I have had at least five items from the menu so far and I got hooked.  It all tasted to what I expected it to and I'm glad for that because there isn't a lot of kosher restaurants out here, so it's nice to know I can get kosher food in a restaurant and enjoy it. The menu selections are awesome a lot to choose from, so there's something for everybody that loves to eat from pastas to pizzas and so on. By the way this place is dairy only. Give them a try you will enjoy it.
