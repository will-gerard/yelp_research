There is no search option for the Wal-Mart Distribution Center located at 58 S. Thornton in Casa Grande so I figured I would post a review here. As a truck driver delivering to this facility it is absolutely a miserable experience. I backed up to the dock at 230 a.m. and the trailer was completely unloaded by 330   a.m. It is now 515 a.m. and I still sit here waiting to be called by receiving to inform me that my paperwork is ready. Truckers drive 11 hours straight to ensure the product is delivered on time, through all sorts of driving conditions and are quite exhausted upon delivery of product. Why is it always a problem to get paperwork done So that a driver can leave to get some rest. And on top of all that, the employees/office staff in receiving are cold and, most of the time, rude to every truck driver they interact with. We aren't bad people and without us you wouldn't have products to stock your store shelves with. We just want to be able to get in, deliver the product, be able to safely leave to find a place to sleep and be on our way all while dealing with friendly employees. Whatever happened to "Service with a Smile"?

One word.....DRAMASTIC! (New word my hair stylist taught me today (1/23) meaning dramatically fantastic! Lol) Bridgette did it again for me, a great cut and style with great service! Thank you!

I come to this Starbucks location 1 to 3 times a day. The staff are always cheerful and pleasant and if there's ever a problem with my order (which is very rare), they fix it promptly and with a smile. I love this place! By far they are the best Starbucks in the Phoenix area and I have mostly been to all of them. Keep up the great service guys.....you rock! :)

Great quiet place. Very dog and child friendly. There is a tennis and basketball court, playground and bathrooms close to the dog park.
