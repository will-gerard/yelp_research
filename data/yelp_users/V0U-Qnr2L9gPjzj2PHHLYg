Tonight was my second visit to Sakana. My first visit was for the lunch sushi special. More sushi than I could eat, for 10 bucks. Although the Cali roles were outstanding, the other pieces were average. Tonight I stopped in for Cali rolls, unagi, and edamame. The Cali rolls looked and tasted like they had been made 30 minutes before I arrived. The Unagi was outstanding! Huge pieces of eel, served warmed, tasty and filling. Service kinda sucked, waited a long time for a drink refil. Overall, average. Will return for sushi lunch special.

Grabbed some hockey gear yesterday (28May2016).  Prices were decent, about 25% of what you would pay for new.  The selection at this store is much better than the one at McClintock and Dobson, worth the drive for us.  The standout at this location is Nate.  This guy rocks.  Nate took the time to explain the hockey gear to us, and guide us to the money saving alternatives.  Outstanding Will definitely come here again.

My wife and I recently purchased handguns from Caswell's.  They made us a good deal on two guns and gave us an additional discount once we had decided.  They included a couple of free range cards after the purchase as a thank you.  The sales staff was knowledgable and friendly.  The shooting range is busy, which is understandable given the current environment.  The lanes have always been clean and functional during our visits.  We have vistsed about every two weeks to stay practiced and comfortable with our weapons.  Their prices on ammunition is not cheap, but not that outrageous either.  Many times we have purchased their ammunition when no other locals supplies had any in stock.  We recently attended one of their training sessions on Concealed Carry Weapons, Advanced.  The class was taught by Russ Kimball, over two days for a total of 14 hours.  This is the most comprehensive class they offer on this topic.  Russ' instruction is impeccable. His mixture of standard material, intermixed with real world stories and examples, really made an impact on us.  Since the class my wife and I have commented often, on how much more aware we are, and how pleased we are to have taken the class.  One downside was that the dry fire range was unavailable for our class.  Having paid almost $300 for this training, we certainly expected to get the full benefit.  Russ was very apologetic, but management said nothing to us, offered no apologies, or compensated us in any way.  This was disappointing, but was no reflection on Russ, who set up one of the ranges for us to complete the dry firing section of the training.  We did have a great time at the simulator, learning to respond correctly to threatening situations.  All in all we are very satisfied with Caswells, and completely satisfied with Russ Kimball.

Had a decent visit to this store for the first time yesterday.  I believe it was about middayJune 28, 2016.  First guy behind the counter lazily answered my question, but really did not engage on a friendly level, as you would expect from a sales associate. Had I left at that point, I would not have even written a review.  Then a gentleman named Davis stepped in.  This guy rocks, and I am really hoping the store manager reads this.  Davis talked to us about the different options that would satisfy our needs, and explained the pro and cons of each one.  He listened to our concerns, and then pointed us towards the gear.  After making our choices, he checked out our purchases while the other guy was busy being on his phone.  I will definitely shop here again, but hope that Davis is there and not the other guy.(That guy should spend less time on his phone and his hair, and just focus on being friendly and interacting with customers.  Thanks Davis, I am a fan. You turned a three review into a four.

So disappointed.  I bought the recent Groupon for Unlimited Washes for 3 months, for the price of one month.  I had to go in and get a barcode put on my car, and then went through some express lane deal where they wash only the exterior of the car and don't even touch the inside of the car!  So I went inside just to let them know that instead of leaving their business as a satisfied customer, I was leaving feeling cheated.  They offered me an upsell in response.  I feel totally cheated.  Without a doubt, somewhere there will be some fine print that explains all of this to me should I dig for it, and will make me feel like an even bigger dolt.  I have to ask myself tho, shouldn't Cobblestone have made this abundantly clear in the Groupon?  I say spend your money elsewhere, where they are more concerned about having happy customers in the end, instead of the upsell.

I appreciate Jason's responding to this review. Sadly I am put off by his defense of his company's reactions, instead of focusing on what they can do better in the future to ensure others are not disappointed.    IMHO this is the equivalent of saying..."Sorry you were ignorant, our company was right, and go get your money back if you are not happy."  Not really focusing on customer satisfaction there.  I feel a better response would have been..."Sorry you were disappointed.  What can we do to make it right?  And in the mean time, we will do our best to improve our marketing materials so that the product descriptions are better communicated."  But that's just me.  Craig

After a poor experience with some $40 steel toed shoes she bought at Big 5 Sporting goods, I sent my daughter to the Red Wing Store in Tempe, and told her to get some quality shoes.  She returned home with a set of shoes called "Worx", for which they charged her $175.  Dubious as to why these were not just called "Red Wing", I pulled a shoe out of the box and read the label.  I was stunned to see "Made In China".  I had always known "Red Wing" as an American company,  I had no idea that they had sold out and started selling Chinese products. Then I Googled the model number.  Turns out you can buy the same boot, new, online for $89.  That is almost half the price the store charged her.  I had her take them back and order the same set from online, as she really like the shoes.    While she was returning them, I browsed the display at the store, out of 10-12 shoes I looked at, only one was actually made in the USA, and it was nearly $300 for a pair.  The one saving grace, is that the store gave her no resistance to return the shoes, and process the refund right away.  To Red Wings credit, they clearly state on the website, that the Worx line is sourced in China.  Sadly the store did not inform my daughter, and she did not think to read the label.  Maybe not a case of buyer beware, but at least inform yourselves, and research before you purchase.

My experience with this Eye Specialist was from many years ago, but was such a horrible experience that I felt compelled to share my experience on Yelp.  I even made a special trip by their location a few days ago so I could take a picture of the office to upload to Yelp.    My experience was with Dr Pachtman, who provided service for our youngest daughter.  As you can see from the photo, he is still listed as a doctor at the office.  I understand that doctors are busy people, and I also understand that they are running a business.  Many times as the day progresses, offices tend to fall behind on their appointments. That said, I tend to work within those expectations as well as I can.  In this experience, when I scheduled my appointment, I asked the office staff for an appointment time when the doctor would most likely be on time.   They suggested first thing in the morning.  So I scheduled it.  Long story short, the doctor was about 40 minutes late.  At about  20 minutes late, I had asked the nurse if this was normal, and she stated "he likes to have all of the rooms filled before he comes in."  So at 20 minutes after my appt was scheduled to start, the doctor hadn't even come in to the building yet. This kind of disrespect really ticked me off,  one thing I don't like is to be treated as cattle, stacked up and waiting.  If I can be on time with my child, the doctor can at least respect his patients enough to show up close to the scheduled appt time.  5 or 10 minutes I can handle, 30 minutes is way over the line for me.  When he finally graced us with his presence, he didn't even acknowledge how late he was.  Either he was oblivious or didn't care. When I called him on it, he said that he was only 35 minutes late and not 40, and said it like I should be ashamed of myself for being 5 minutes off. Amazing gall on this doctor, and it put me over the edge. So verbally I let him have it, told him just how I felt about him.  Best feeling in the world!  Of course he demanded that I leave, which I did, in a timely manner!  My wife was ticked, but we moved on to another eye specialist, and have never been back to Dr Pachtman.  My daughters eyes are fine, no thanks to this eye specialist!  Do yourself a favor and find somebody else!

The retail section is average, but the parts counter experience sucked!  I spoke with Jim, who could not understand that if he gave me the part number for an item they had on hand, that I could "Google" it and find a picture to tell if it would work for me.  I tried several ways to explain it to him, which only frustrated him.  So he told me I needed to talk to a different department, and and parked me on hold.  After 5 minutes of waiting I hung up.  Can't wait to see him in person.....

I agree with everyone else, this McDonalds is the worst.    On a recent visit, a young guy named "Wes" was the only person working the register, this was just a few minutes prior to 8AM, so it was reasonably busy.  Wes was struggling a little but definitely trying his best.  I placed my order.  When the order was ready, the lady who had been yelling out order numbers, yelled out my number and I walked to the counter.  The coffee was missing so I asked her..."There should be a coffee with this order, please?"  She tersely informed me that "He gets the drinks, I get the food." , while pointing at Wes.  She then tells Wes..."Hurry up Wes, you are falling behind."    I told her that I was sorry that I didn't know the "rules of operation" for her particular McDonalds.  I don't think she even picked up on the sarcasm....  I asked for the franchise owners name before I left, but have since forgotten.  I do remember this lady's name.  It is Melissa, and she sadly turns out to be the manager.  I will drive those extra miles the next time....

Basko is great.  He built me a Turbo HOnda Head quite a few years ago that is still running boosted as a daily driver.  Years later he helped my daughter do a science project on air inlet shaping.  JUst took a motorcycle head to him the other day, adn he turned it around in a day.  Outstanding

Although I decided not to have my car worked on by TriCity, my experience with them was very positive.  Ray was always very cordial and courteous on the phone, and continued to try and earn my business.  Nothing but positive interactions with everyone there.  It turned out to be a communication issue, where all of the available options were not explained to me initially.  I was looking for a cheaper option than a full rebuild, and did not find out that a used transmission was an option until the morning I told them I was taking the vehicle elsewhere to have that done.  A suggestion I have for both TriCity and a potential customer, is to fully discuss all available options in the beginning.  Potential customers should always ask...What other options are available?....until they find something they are happy with.  Had TriCity told me the first day, that a used warrantied transmission was an available option, I would have most likely had them do the work, and my car would be fixed already.  No hard feelings at all, and I will certainly give them a chance in the future for my business.

Famous Daves @ Chandler Fashion Center has never failed to satisfy me.  Tonight's brisket was excellent, as always.  In all my travels and efforts to find good brisket, Dave's always provides excellent food and service.

Recently, I have become less than completely pleased with Discount Tire.  Although we are religious in our purchase of the best warranty they offer, it always seems like there is some reason why "this time" the warranty can not cover something and we have to pay more.  In fact, my frustration at this was at a high enough level, that I had a scathing speech prepared ahead of time on my latest visit.  I took in a $140 tire, that had blown out the sidewall, probably from a pothole or some other road hazard.  The guy looked at it, pulled up my record, and took the tire out to the shop area.  Upon his return. he rang up the new tire, and said..."That will be $140."  I was stunned.  Speech forgotten, I looked him in the eye (my murderous intent plainly visible yet unspoken), and said "Your not going to give me any credit at all on the warranty for that tire?"  Evidently able to read my unspoken intentions, he said he would take another look, and headed back out to the shop.  Upon his return, he adjusted the sale on the screen, and said "That will be $16 for the warranty on the new tire."  Sweet.  So he gave me full credit on the old tire, and I paid only for the warranty for the new tire.  Thanks Discount Tire, you have earned yet another chance.

Jessica rocks!  She has been doing my cuts for about two years now.  I'm not a big team sports guy, and would like to see some sort of racing instead, but that's no big deal.  The cuts are great, the new prices leave me more satisfied, and cause me to leave a larger tip.  Good all around!

A year and a half later, and Jessica is still the haircut girl of my dreams. There have been a couple of occasions where I've had to get cut by other girls at Sport Clips, and even cuts at places other than SportClips. The SportClips cuts were always good, far above the other places I went to .   Be sure to tell Jessica hi for me if you go in!

First Attempt - I was terribly disappointed.  I had gone by earlier in the evening to try their thick sliced beef brisket, and it was yummy.  Later when I came by to buy dinner for my family, and placed my order for three thick sliced beef brisket dinners, I was told "we just ran out".  Talk about pissed, I was pissed!  We ended up settling for the thin brisket they use on their sandwiches, which was soaked in sauce, and had way to much fat in it.  The staff was as nice about it as they could be, and offered us free drinks to make up for the disappointment.  I can't rate them too far down for what could possibly be a one time thing.  So I will give them one more chance.  Second Attempt - Took the family over for dinner, my second attempt at getting some brisket.  This time I was told that they did have the thick sliced brisket, but that it was one of their slow days, so it had been sitting for a while and was dry.  My wife and daughter had liked the chopped brisket before, so they settled for that.  I settled for a hot link.  All meals were tasty.  Third Attempt - I went by to grab lunch Saturday, and ordered the brisket.  Took it home, fired up the TV, and sat down to eat.  All in all, I was unimpressed.  The brisket tasted ok, but was dry.  Even their sauce, also tasty, could not rescue it.  Don't know if I will bother returning or not.  Have reduced my rating from three starts to two.  Was giving the benefit of the doubt before.  But after three strikes, I am just left frustrated at Andrews BBQ

Today I hit up Andrews BBQ for the brisket.  Disappointed again!  The brisket was properly cooked, decent flavor, but was appeared dry and tasted dry.  The cornbread was excellent, but served cold. Hot would have earned another star, in spite of the dry brisket.  The Green Chile Mac was tasty, but had sat so long it was mushy.  For the 25 I spent for two lunch specials, I walked away feeling like I did not get my money's worth.  I'll try it again in a pinch, but still consider Rudy's to be the top spot in the East Valley, with Famous Dave's coming in at number two.  This is my fourth attempt at Andrews.

Would hardly call this a "joint".  It is well appointed, artistically decorated ,and highly priced.  Lunch for a friend and I topped out at $36 including tip.  Burger was perfect.  Bacon perfectly cooked, great bun, tasty beef.  Good all around, and the sweet potato fries were excellent.  Not sure I am committed to $18 for lunch anytime soon again.  But it was delicious.

AT&T Just continues to suck.  They recently tricked my wife into opting for the Next plan, because it would "save us money".  Surprise Surprise, my monthly bill is the same as it was before, no money saved.  That was thanks to Adian, or Adrian, the bald guy that looks like Jaime the Mythbuster guy.  This guy later pushed the upsell so hard that I walked away and started talking to another rep in the store.    Today, after checking out upgrade options on the website, I took my daughter in for an upgraded phone.  Should have cost me 99c plus a $40 upgrade fee(wat!).  This time I ran into Earl, who proceeded to explain in such obscure terms about why I could not do what the website said, and instead had to pay $75 early upgrade, adn pay off my wifes phone, or join the next program, and.....I apologized to my daughter and walked out.  Went home and got on the website, and easily ordered the phone she wanted for the 99c plus $40, and called it done.  Screw you Earl.  Craig

Stopped in to this joint for lunch one day and ordered brisket.  They had pulled it for sandwiches, instead of slicing it.  Was stringy and tough.  May try again later, may not.   My quest for good brisket in the valley continues.  So far Famous Dave's is my top choice.

So....I love brisket, not so much BBQ, pretty much just brisket.  So much so, that I've become a brisket snob of sorts.  I'm sure there are others out there with a more refined palette than my own, but I am definitely sure of what I think a good brisket should be...  That said...I attended the Chandler BBQ festival a few weeks back, with the mission of finding a brisket that exceeds Famous Dave's.  You see, Dave's brisket is the current standard for me, as it is consistently better than many of the independent restaurants in the east valley.  So, at the BBQ festival...I went from vendor to vendor, sampling the brisket offerings from all the vendors. Two stood out and Ryno's was one of those two.  The brisket was tender, divided easily, great flavor, with a mildly sweet finish. (They use fruit and nut based woods,which you can taste in the flavors and finishes.)  The brisket I had that day was outstanding.  "Oustanding!"   The guys manning the booth even took the time to describe for me their process, the wood they used, etc.  Great brisket and excellent customer service?  I was sure that we had a contender here, worthy of unseating Dave.  So yesterday we were out in the area near Ryno's, and I decided that we would get dinner there.  I was ready to filled with brisket happiness.  What a let down.  The brisket was not hot when served, but was reasonably warm.  It did not divide easily, but had to be separated with force. The flavor was acceptable, but I was so disappointed by the toughness that it spoiled any other satisfaction I might have had.  That said, the beans were good and creamed corn was excellent.  We didn't even finish the brisket.    As we were walking towards our car, I told my wife how disappointed I was.  She suggested I go tell them. So I walked back in...the young man behind the counter greeted me in a lukewarm manner (sidenote:  teach your counter staff to be as engaging as your cooks were during the BBQ festival!) I asked to talk to whomever was cooking that evening.  A lady came out from the back and I explained for her what I had experienced, and how disappointed I was in the brisket I had just eaten, when compared to their brisket at the festival.  She was very nice, and mentioned that someone had done something during the cooking process (they evidently pulled the brisket off to load some other meat, and then put it back on.)  I was glad that she was open about this, but that was as far as it went.  There was no offer to reduce the bill, or refund, or even a discount on a future meal.  I'll give Ryno's one more chance, and then it's back to Dave's if they fail again.

My daughter and I visited today for the first time.  The staff was very courteous, and I believe it was the manager or franchise owner that greeted us.  He described the menu for us, and welcomed us to the restaurant,was clean and bright.  That said, I had one of the Carne Asada tacos, and one of the Al Pastor tacos.  Both were kind of average and uninspiring.  Here is the quick list of likes and dislikes about the food.  1. The guacamole was the processed kind, not the handmade kind, this caused it to have a processed flavor which was kind of flat and off.  2. The tortillas were kind of weak, and partially fell apart during the meal.  3. The Carne Asada was overcooked.  4. The Al Pastor was pretty good.  Being a franchise, I don't know if they can change things like which tortillas or guacamole they use, but it would definitely make things better.  I doubt that I will return.

I use LinkedIn as a networking tool for professionals.  I was recently sent a "connect" request on LinkedIn from Stacey Wisman.  I was a little baffled, but approved it.  A few hours later, she hits me up with a request to come meet her for financial planning help.  I was shocked, as this was my first ever spamming from someone on LinkedIn.  I believe that LinkedIn is for networking with professionals, not for spamming people you have no connection to. I think this is unprofessional, and definitely paints this company in a bad light for me.  I will certainly remember the MassMutual name now, but only in a negative way.

I received an obvious marketing ploy letter in the mail for a free Android tablet.  Sure am glad I found these reviews on Yelp.  "Clubs" like these were around about 20 years ago, and promised big savings for a huge entry fee.  Yeah the prices were great, but it was all on goods I was not planning on buying anyway. I'm with Kris L on this...unless you are already planning to spend a huge amount on these types of items, stay away.  There's a reason these types of businesses use aggressive marketing ploys.  They prey on the financially illiterate who can be swayed by a freebie, and swoon over luxury goods. Stay away.

First visit to the Shack tonight.  I had the Catfish and teen daughter had the Shrimp.  Neither of us were impressed.  The catfish was so overcooked that it was mushy inside the breading.  Granted, this is not their specialty, so I will probably try again, and will update my review after the next visit.  And BTW, to the hostess working 5/29/2016 at 7PM, those high-waisted shorts need to go, they are unflattering. (Sorry, I know some would consider that rude or inappropriate.  It is what it is...)

1st visit on 2 Oct 15.  My daughter and I stopped in for a quick bite.  Sat at the Sushi bar.  Had a Cali Roll, Avocado Roll, and Fresh Water Eel.  The seaweed wrapper was chewy to the point of frustration to eat it, which marred the entire sushi experience.  All the rolls were average taste-wise.  The Unagi was served cold. The waitress never asked if we wanted drinks other than the water we initially received.   All around a negative experience, and I doubt that I will return.
