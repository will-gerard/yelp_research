Worse Than KMart photography! I HAD to take my son to Cameo studios for his senior graduation pictures as per his high school yearbook requirement. I bought the suit, chose the 2nd clothing option, got the haircut and cleaned up my teenager. I made the appointment for the photo shoot well in advance and discussed with the studio receptionist what I wanted to achieve with his pictures. We arrived to a very busy & bustling studio FULL of people and teenagers coming and going. I was a little concerned that it was going to be an assembly line situation and Boy, was I right! My son and I sat down on some chairs and after several minutes a very young girl came out and called his name. I assumed she was an assistant as she whisked my son away and into a studio room. At that time, I sat down, reached into my purse to fool around with my cell phone, when suddenly my son was standing in front of me and asked, "Are you ready?" "Ready for what??" I say. "Ready to go. Im done!" There is NO WAY that someone does a senior portrait photo shoot in 30 seconds! I find the 'young girl" and ask her how many pictures were taken of my son and she tells me that she took 8. So, she wasnt the assistant but the hired help photographer!  I start to argue about the quality and time involved in good portrait photography but I can see that I am dealing with a kid that was hired to just press the button on the camera assembly line fashion. She assures me that the shots will turn out great and will be ready to preview in a few minutes. SO, after waiting several minutes to view the proofs. I get more and more worried, because I see several teens having their own dressing rooms, doing full length professional shoots....and I wonder, "Why didnt I get that when I specifically requested it? And what the heck is a Scottsdale/Paradise Valley high school doing requiring such UNprofessionals for their mandatory yearbook portraits?? So, we finally get called to view our proofs.....what do I see?? I see 8 pictures of my son that are all identical, with slight ranges of smiling all in the same fake pose. HORRIFIED!! TACKY! I immediately hired a real photographer to redo his pictures and did NOT order anything from Cameo. NOT RECOMMENDED

Nice ladies all the time that seem to really enjoy working here!  I hate to tell anyone that this is my favorite secret place to find semi-precious baubles for great prices! I want them all to myself! The jewelry is new and I believe she told me comes from Israel. I have the most gorgeous pink turquoise bracelet and necklace from here. Its very unique stuff.  Their clothes are fun to go thru also. Ive purchased some amazing things from this store!

I moved to central PHX 15 tears ago and fell in love with Giuseppe's Eggplant Parmesan subs when they were located on Indian School rd.  After moving several times and finally settling in to the 85254 neighborhood, I was elated to find the new Giuseppe's at the Scottsdale Rd/Thunderbird location. This place is THE BEST Italian restaurant this side of Chicago! You can pay more at the "other" Italian restaurant a few doors down, but nothing beats the family recipes at Giuseppe's that make these meals delectable.  Bottom line, this place makes the best sauce in town! The veal, the eggplant rolletini and the eggplant parmesan will all satisfy you and make you want to return again and again! Their desserts are mouth watering and their prices fair. The fact that you can bring your own bottle of wine with no cork fee is even better! I also LOVE the fact that the family is warm and friendly and speaks Italian to all of the other Italian families visiting the restaurant. This restaurant has a very Chicago/East Coast Italian feel....warm, inviting and mouth watering!!  PS-The Mrs. makes FABULOUS cannoli's!!   Mangia!!!

Everything I have ever ordered here is AMAZING!! I even turned my 'meat & potato's' husband onto this place who had lunch with me here  'just to please me'. He now eats his lunch here EVERY Wednesday like clockwork! We are both addicted! I adore the thai peanut bowl and hubby loves the mexicali burger. The garlic hummus is also YUMMY as is the No Harm Chicken Parm!! My only gripe is that they dont have a 2nd location in North Scottsdale!! (hint-hint!!)

Ive been coming to the Barrio for many years. The food items seem 'different' at different times. (Guacamole is always different...chunky, smooth, raspberries, cranberries, pomegranate...). I have found that the filet topped with crab cake is probably one of the best in town. My husband loves the Mole here. The deserts have never wowed me, however, the tequila and margaritas are always strong and worthy! Bring your credit cards....its not cheap!

This USED TO BE one of my favorite sushi bars, but we will probably never eat here again. We recently met our Los Angeles guests at Stingray. I made a reservation for 5 since our time allowed for dinner was short and we didnt want to have to wait for a table. Every waitress in the restaurant, looked like they were cloned from the same model. They were all beautiful brunettes. (Not complaining about their beauty AT ALL!). However, their service skills were poor. After being seated, we started off by ordering 2 bowls of Edemame, while we looked at the sushi menu.  When the waitress came back empty handed, we ordered our sushi rolls. About 20-30 minutes later, we received ONE bowl of Edamame and reminded our server of the 2nd bowl ordered. Another 20-30 minutes later, we received the sushi all on one plate. I realize that many sushi bars do this (My pet peeve), however, when you are sitting at a long table, it makes it near impossible to reach across with chopsticks to eat and have to pass or share the plate. Since we did not receive any soy sauce, ginger or wasabi with our sushi,  we had to ask for it....and wait for it!! 10 minutes later, we had to ask for the condiments again. Another 10 minutes later and still no condiments, someone at our table went in and got it themselves. After several more minutes, one of the cloned brunettes came over and slapped some soy sauce in front of one of our guests who was NOT eating  sushi at all. He asked,   "Whats this?", but she just turned and left the table.   Again we had to ask about our 2nd bowl of Edamame and were continually promised they would bring it to our table.   Toward the end of the meal, the server brought us our bill along with the 2nd order of edamame, as if it were our dessert!!    To top it off, the server included a 20% gratuity. I have no problem tipping for good service or a good meal and understand when gratuity is included with large parties, but a table of 5? We were told it was because we made a reservation! wow.   One of the guests suggesting putting a -$20.00 (negative) in the blank tip area on the credit card slip, but we didnt do that.   Instead we tipped appropriately and left.   The sad part is, that Stingray Sushi just showed some of the biggest entertainment moguls from Los Angeles the worst service of their life and now I have to find another sushi bar to entertain my guests in!

Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!  Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door! Fast service and great food too!  HUGE portions!! I recommend splitting entree's. We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home! I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy. Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them! (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!).  Moderate prices. Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?  I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!!...and they were pretty darn good!!   To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!!  Yummy!!

I stopped in one afternoon with a friend  to satisfy our sweet craving. I had read the reviews that the cupcakes were supposed to be fabulous. The owner (whose photograph was on the walls)  was busy chatting on her cell phone and totally ignored us as we looked at the cupcakes. I wanted to ask a question about the days cupcake menu since it was only about noon and there wasnt very many cupcakes to choose from in the case.  She finally took a break from gossiping about some woman and we ordered a vanilla cupcake. It tasted pretty good, but I didnt fall off my seat. In fact, the cake itself was filled with many good sized airholes and was fairly dry. I mentioned to my friend that the frosting was "pretty" and the woman took that moment away from her cell phone to tell me that they are "known" for their airbrushed frosting...then went back to babbling on her phone.  I was appalled at the customer service being so unprofessional especially since it was one of the owners. She wasnt rude, but she wasnt friendly or customer service oriented at all. She acted more like a college kid talking about last nights party than a business woman in Scottsdale. All in all, I was very underwhelmed.

THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST!! *****VERY PROFESSIONAL***** CLEAN and PROMPT!!  I had called 2 solar screen companies off of Craigslist before checking  Yelp. I saw that EXPRESS SOLAR had a 5 star rating. After reading the  rave reviews about the family owned business and the great work they did,  I decided to call them.  From the moment Kevin answered the phone, he was polite, friendly and professional with no hard sell. He was not only fun to chat with but his price quote beat the other companies quotes that I had gotten! He took a lot of time to answer my many questions and scheduled my install right away! (Its takes a few days for the company to build the custom screens).  I received a confirmation call the night before install, and Kevin & his brother showed up ON TIME the next day!  They also washed my windows for me before installing the screens!    THE SCREENS LOOK AMAZING!!  VERY HIGH QUALITY!!  This company does many other services besides just solar screens and I am excited to consider them for future home improvement projects that I need done!  *****AWESOME FAMILY COMPANY!!****HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!*****

First, let me say that I am a very finicky customer. I worked in the beauty & styling industry for years with the best of the best (in another state) and know my way around salon technique. The bottom line is that after spending $350, I had received hair that wasnt even remotely close to what I had asked for. The stylist, Forest, was polite, professional and had good technique. However, in the end, she did what she wanted and I walked away extremely dissatisfied.  My color was brassy at the roots and drab at the ends. The fine weave I received was exactly what I asked her NOT to do. The salons interior was clean, but the interior aesthetics were outdated and lackluster. The design wouldn't bother me in the least had the stylist been a better listener or the price been more fair. I would not return to Rolfs to 'try again' . At the price I paid, it should have been close to perfect. Stylists are a dime a dozen in this town and the great stylist are almost non-existent. Update- I decided to go back to the stylist  the following weeks to give her the chance to "correct" the color. I figured that a few foils later and I could achieve the desired look I had paid for and desired. The receptionist implied that I was just looking for a touch up and that everyone needs a touch up after their hair grows! I found her attitude very condescending. The stylist kept saying that I had asked her for that color.  When I was finished, I was appalled to find that I was being charged an additional $100plus to correct their mistakes and I left the salon with hair breaking off all the way home. So in all, I spent over $500 and more than 6 hrs for very mediocre salon services and broken damaged hair, even though their website states that highlights are from $75 and up. Im not sure what made my highlights so much more expensive...

I purchased the T Mobile G1 in December after my beloved Sidekick was on its last straw. Even though TMobiles customer service is HORRIBLE, screwy and usually totally mixed up, I decided to stay with the provider and try their much touted G1. The sales girl at the Desert Ridge store screwed up my billing (it was supposed to be billed to the company I work for) but instead it came to my credit card. When I went to resubmit to the company, they were no longer offering that cell phone reimbursement, so I had to shell out payments on my own due to her mistake.  Thanx TMobile!  24 hrs after I bought the G1,  had trouble manipulating the slide out keyboards keys,I returned to the store where my sales girl told me to go out and buy the replaceable silicone keyboard for the phone. SHe told me that TMobile was "out" but that I could pick them up in the mall at the cell phone kiosks. I ran around town(on my days off from work and kids) trying desperately to find the replaceable silicon keyboard. I hated typing and texting on a phone whose buttons barely worked. By the time I finally tried to locate the mysterious replaceable keyboard on the internet, I found out there was no such item. The salesgirl totally lied to me! I took the phone back to TMobile, to which I was told,   "You have 14 days to return our phones. It is day 15 today!! Sorry!"    Yesterday, I went to Sprint and got the new HTC ProTouch 2....which works FABULOUS!! THANK YOU SPRINT!!!

Great East Coast Italian subs! Order your sub, "Mikes Way"....it's great! Friendly owners and staff, go out of their way to be friendly and personable. In fact, my young son is such a fan they recognize him when he comes in. His dream is to work at Jersey Mikes when he turns 16 so he can eat Jersey Mikes every day! Yummy!

I took my hubby here for his 50th birthday after purchasing a Groupon for it. I was a bit disappointed as I drove up to the Safeway shopping strip and  saw the restaurant there. However, when we arrived, the staff greeted us promptly and with smiles. We were seated immedatley.  As soon as my butt hit the seat, the busboy was pouring me a tall glass of ice water. YAY! I am a big water drinker and living in Arizona, I am always parched! I hate to have to ask and wait for a water!  My biggest pet peeve is having to beg for tap water from restaurant servers...especially in pricey restaurants! SO, THANK YOU! The server immediately came over smiling and told us about the restaurant and specials.  Bread was offered by another staff member. Our order was taken promptly. We ordered Tuna appetizer & a wine split. Hubby ordered Tilefish and I ordered Lambchops. The wine was delish as was the tuna sashimi. After our appetizer, they brought us an espresso cup willed with the richest, most buttery creamed cauliflower soup I had tasted. We were both delighted !  When the meal came, it was the perfect portion....not too small and not overloaded. The food was very nice. At the end of our meal, they brought us each a homemade chocolate chip shortbread that was cellophane wrapped like a gift! As we exited the restaurant, the host & hostess at the front door actually opened the doors and held them for us. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! ****BEST IN PHOENIX!!  As I was leaving, I said to my husband, "Everything was great, but none of the food I ate tonight would I ever crave and want to rush back for!".......Nothing really made my taste buds dance....:-(

I needed termite treatment on my home and the estimate I received from Terminex was around $3000. Ouch! I looked on YELP to get 2nd or 3rd opinions and found the great reviews for House Doctor Exterminating. Not only was this company, prompt, courteous and professional, they also beat the 'other guys' bids by ALOT! After meeting with the owner, David, and getting the bid, I felt that I no longer had to keep looking. His team came out within days, arrived on time and cleaned up any mess that they made. This company also offers new customer specials, which was appreciated!  David is super friendly and down to earth guy that makes you feel comfortable and well cared for.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

My husband purchased a very expensive desktop for me for my birthday. When we set it up, we had difficulty with my emails not being received, as well as a few other issues. I packed it up and brought it into the store where it was purchased, looking for assistance with set up. The staff was polite, but for the first 30 minutes the 'team' was feverishly trying to sell me programs for the computer. They were really giving me the hard sell to buy all of these programs at an additional fee. One of the guys even asked me to pull up and show him photos of mine on the internet. Every time, I mentioned trying to 'fix' the issue of email first, they kept steering me towards purchasing additional items or a more expensive computer. After the wheeling and dealing of the clearly commission based staff, I had to be rude and say, "Look, I just want my computer to receive my email!" I was told that, my husband should have set that all up in the store at the time of purchase and that NOW it would cost an additional $200 for any assistance!! Basically I had to tell them to effoff and now I have a very expensive dust collector at my house. Apple customer service blows.

I was recommended to this store by my contractor during an extensive remodel and addition of our Scottsdale home.   When I arrived, the female front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I found a large 10 ft. iron front entry door at a 'steal' of a price. My sales rep (Carla) was there to answer all of my questions. Since the door was a floor model, I had a few things I needed to know before I purchased the iron door.  Question #1- Was the door complete? Answer- YES Question #2- Was there any damage or was anything missing? Anything I needed to know? Answer-NO Questions #3-Was there a deadbolt and keys with the door? Answer- Yes  Carla mentioned that there were a few 'nicks' in the iron painted finish and would send the door out with touch up paint kit.  I purchased the door on a Thursday and mentioned that my contractor had an iron door specialist to install it.   "Oh no...." Carla said, "You should use our door installer. If anything happens, we guarantee the work."   So, I agreed to use Unique building Concepts door installer. He was to install the door the following Monday. When he arrived with the door, it was missing the deadbolt & keys, the bottom sweep and the touch up paint kit. I immediately called Unique and asked to speak to Carla. She was busy and I was on hold for quite some time before she finally picked up. She told me that the door installer picked up the door too  early and they could not get the door ready for me in time. (5 days after purchase wasnt enough time??  But she blamed the installer)   Carla told me that I could get a sweep fairly cheep and the deadbolt wasnt too expensive either so not to worry! She promised to mail the touch up paint.   Wow! I thought....thats a bunch of crap! I was told the door was complete! Now your telling me to run out and take care of this stuff myself?   I mentioned to Carla that she was my sales person and she told me that the door was intact. She then told me that the owner wasnt going to help me because "I got such a good deal on the door" and her hands were tied.   Well, after installation, my contractor came over to inspect the door. The 10 ft door had half of its mounting brackets hack-sawed off by their professional door installer!The brackets were left lying on the ground on my front porch area.  He said the door was not safe to have installed that way and we all scratched our heads wondering why he removed half of the brackets?    Again, I called Unique building to speak with Carla but this time she would not take my calls. In fact, I had to call several times, over several days to get her to speak with me. (She never once called me back after I left messages and again blamed someone else in the office for this error.) When I told her about the poor installation job and how my contractor said it isnt installed safely and would not pass permits or codes, she basically said...   "Well, youll have to talk to the installer. He said its just fine, so thats between you and him!"   What happened to my guarantee with using their installer??!   Well, their installer refused to do anything different, so I had to hire a new door guy to weld the brackets back on and re-install the door. After the new installer put the deabolt on, he informed me that the door did not line up with the jam. Hence the reason no deadbolt was on the door to begin with. So, my new guy had to re-drill the jam as well.   Bottom line, they sold faulty products under false pretense and lied about everything.    To make matters worse, the owners of this business thinks it is all fine and dandy to run his business this way!   My contractor actually cancelled his account with Unique after this shady dealing because he was so appalled at their behavior.    Bad, Bad, Bad Customer Service. They were the biggest nightmare of my building and remodel!!

I live in this general area and had driven by several times while the store  was preparing for their opening. Being a self proclaimed "Thrift Store Wh*re", I was quite excited that it was so close to my neighborhood. One day I passed the store and there were garment racks outside by the front door and a cute little chair on display like most stores like this have out to entice the customers. I pulled into the parking lot and walked inside the store. After browsing for a few minutes a woman walked up to me and rudely said something to the effect of, "What are you doing here? We are NOT open for business!!!" I apologized and mentioned that the door was open and the display was outside, so I just assumed. "Well we are trying to get our inventory ready!!" she snapped at me.  I figured that I caught her on a stressful day, apologized and left. A few weeks later when the store really did appear open, I went back to give them a 2nd shot.  After browsing at all of the over priced, used items, I came across a display of reading glasses with rhinestones on them. I had purchased these exact reading glasses from the same designer at RazMaTaz (for only $19). "Those are cute glasses arent they?" The salesperson asked me. "Yes, but how much are they?" I asked, I didnt see a price tag. "$40" she told me. "Ohhhh," I said, "I buy these exact glasses at Razmataz for only $19" So, she snapped,  "Well, why dont you go to RazMaTaz then?"  I looked at her like, "Are we in 2nd grade here?"...then left.  I cant say that I have ever thought about giving this place of rude staff a 3rd try!

I had been at this restaurant when it first opened and had nice service and food. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated with lots of indoor and outdoor seating. Last Saturday, my husband and I decided to revisit for an early dinner. We arrived around 6pm and did not have reservations. There was ONE party on the patio and a few parties inside. There were at least 20 or more open tables and nobody at the bar.  The hostess greeted us and asked if we had a reservation. When we told her "no", she ROLLED HER EYES and said that she was sorry that she had nothing available. I asked her about the 20-30 EMPTY tables and told her that we only wanted a quick bite, but she told me that they were full and we could sit at the bar, that there was plenty of room there. FULL? (I think she meant EMPTY). Actually there was plenty of room EVERYWHERE and nobody coming up to the doors. so I was surprised. I chose to leave the restaurant and NOT give them my service primarily due to the hostess 'rolling of the eyes' and condescending attitude. Every other restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale would happily seat us no matter how busy they were, so we chose to spend our money elsewhere. Actually we went to COWBOY CIAO, which was full, but they worked us in, seated us immediately in a quaint little table & gave us excellent, friendly service. WIth that, we ordered a whole bottle of wine, pigged out and enjoyed the awesome atmosphere!

WenT to Parc Central about 2 months after they first opened with 2 other friends. We sat in the bar area while the band played. The men in the bar area were all sitting on the edge of their seats acting like they were in a strip club as they flirted with the female vocalist who danced sexily around. Our waitress was young, dumb and lacked any training. We ordered 3 cocktails and she brought back two. My mojito was the missing drink, so she left and came back about 30 minutes later and said thAt the bar was out of mint. By this time I was so dehydrated, I asked for a glass of water and a martini just to make her job as simple as possible. When she finally returned with my drinks, we had to beg her to tAke our dinner order. We had already been there an hour and the place was packed. Everybody else seemed to be eating but us. The first three things I ordered, they were out of! (including their signature lamb chops and the fish special!). My friend ordered the lobster lasagna which we were told by the staff was amazing.  (it wasn't!)  The rolls that were brought to the table were cold, hard and had no butter or oils for spreading on them. Our food was brought out after a very long wait and wasnt even hot. The lobster was tough and over cooked. The sauce was bland. My friend refused to eat it and the waitress could've cared less. Dirty dishes piled up on our table...water glasses sat empty and never got refilled, even after asking for more water and finally a waitress from another section came over, apologized and cleaned up our table as she headed out from ending her shift!!! Our bill arrived and for $140 dinner bill, I would have expected either better food or better service, but got neither.

The closest thing to L.A. in Phoenix!  I went here with my hubby for Jen Deveroux Animal Royale fashion show. (Jen is this super cute little pink haired chica that I just wanted to invite over for tea!)  Hubby & I arrived a bit early so we ordered a drink and sat in a small table.   I was THRILLED that they had a Vanilla Bean rice pudding on the menu, so I ordered it!  The waitress was polite and brought me this big plastic bowl with a plastic spoon and it was FILLED with rice pudding!!! And it was only $3!!  It was DELISH!! My tastebuds soared!! I was sooo happy consuming this delight!  Anyway.... The 3 people at the table next to us were super friendly and we all chatted.  In fact, everyone at this place seemed super friendly and uber fun! The crowd was this beautiful eclectic mix of gay/lesbian, punk/rock/biker/techno peop's with lots of fun and cool hairstyles, make up and fashion.  We had a great time and I would highly recommend!

Jordyn gave me a really nice photofacial and hand treatment. The Palomar Lux laser is an excellent laser. Jordyn was very sweet, friendly, outgoing and polite. The only reason for the 4 star rating is because the location  was difficult to find and the staff didnt really let customers know or explain the location issue in their advertisements or booking even though alot of customers have trouble finding it. Overall, it was a nice experience. Jordyn was a great employee and really did a professional job.

Update- I went back for a photofacial and unfortunately, Jordyn was no longer working at the spa. I had another girl, who did a photofacial on me and she finished so quickly (about 10 minutes) I wondered if I was even going to get any results. Sure enough, just as I guessed, there was literally NO result, no flaking and no lightening of the dark spots.  Waste of Money! Wont go back!

I have visited this store several times without much luck. As in any consignment or 2nd hand store, this is quite normal. You dont always find the perfect item when you visit and have to make several attempts before wondering if it is the store or the customer. After visiting this store several times, I happen to be there one day when this woman began screaming at her 3-4 yr old little boy. I hadnt noticed him doing anything out of the ordinary other than a few skips thru the store. After the woman ripped into this kid, out of the corner of my eye I saw his REAL Mother grab him and hurry him out of the store. The woman who was screaming at him was the store manager/cashier/clerk!!!!!  When I saw this, I left and never went back.  I have dealt with the general public in all of my jobs and there is a good way and a bad way to deal with these types of things.

I found this company on Craigslist and the owner, Jimmy, answered all of my questions promptly and professionally. He came out as soon as I requested, was on time and gave me the bid. He worked within my budget and built the requested decorative courtyard gate pretty much overnight!  I never felt pressured and he was so affordable for this type of custom iron work!!  The end result of my gate was very high quality and he was professional and friendly. In fact, when I went to pay my bill upon completion, he didnt have the change for my cash and he took less than his bid just to make it easy for me.  Super nice guy! Excellent Quality work! Highly recommend!

I have used Jackie for upper and lower eyeliner and she did an excellant job. I would recommend her to anyone. She has a keen eye and is very professional. The ink colors she uses is very natural.  Ive had this procedure done in the past with very poor results (fading, weak lines, etc). Jackies work lasts and looks natural. I am going back for brows in a few weeks! I cant wait!  Jackie is also very good to her repeat customers by providing them with her current specials.

I just read one of the reviews about not having to drive to Scottsdale for MedSpa treatments. Well I drive FROM Scottsdale to Premier Wellness & Aglow Medspa!! It is worth the drive and will never go to another Medspa since finding such professionals here. I tell all of my friends that it is WORTH the drive to go to an expert when you are talking about your face. Premier hires only the finest medical experts and are highly trained. They have a keen eye for skin care and I always get a very natural result. I have been there several times and have had 2 different types of filler as well as micro-needling treatments. I was bragging about how they took 10 years off of my face in the first treatment! I no longer have bags under my eyes!! Which is the best thing anyone has ever done to me because I was so self conscious about them. I also like the fact that the staff is very classy & well put together, but down to earth and kind. They really seem to care about each and every patient. With each of my treatments I was given total numbing to make it as comfortable as possible. They also have comfortable chairs with blankets and pillows to relax while your numbing takes effect. This is by far the BEST MEDSPA and MOST PROFESSIONAL with the BEST RESULTS that I have ever been to (and I have been to a lot!!).

OK, so I go here a LOT. I am a woman in my 50's and skin care is so important at this time in my life, so I feel its worth it to have Premier Wellness help me look good and keep my skin in top shape. I love this place so much, this is the 2nd review I am writing about them!  I was just at the clinic last week for some botox and filler. Apparently, the office has a new Doctor doing the injectables and she is AMAZING!! Her positive attitude and gentle ways put me at ease immediately! She has a calm and kind bedside manner and treats each patient like a queen (or king!) She is by far the best injector I have ever had!  I think she is my new best friend!! haha! I would also like to say that I am THRILLED with the results! Thank you Premier Wellness and Aglow Medspa!!

NOT a CHAIN RESTAURANT!!!  Amazing Unique Food! Stellar Service! Fabulous Bar & Wine Service. Try the Grilled Asparagus with Candied Bacon! Delish! We also ordered the Grilled Octopus with Chick Peas and Lemon which has a unique layer of flavors and brightness. We tried the Squid Ink Pasta and Seared Scallops and couldnt believe the flavors that the charming and polite Chef Gio can incorporate into these marvelous dishes! Afterwards we tried every single dessert on the menu, courtesy of Chef Gio. (Not sure how we got so lucky that night!!)  I honestly couldnt choose a favorite because they were all so delicious! They were definitely worth the calories! The cremes and cakes and ice creams were probably the best I have ever tasted in any of my travels. Would I go back? In a heartbeat! This is hands down the best restaurant in the state!

I would have given a zero but my car did come out clean, so I guess they can have a one star! However, the rude employees at check in are so overly concerned with upselling that they provide a TERRIBLE first impression of this business.  When I pulled up, there was only one other car getting vacuumed and the employees were talking which took about 5 minutes for them to even acknowledge me. When they did, I asked for just the basic wash as I was in a hurry. The employee writing the ticket tried to upsell FOUR times, not paying attention to me that I only wanted the BASIC before I finally had to say, "Look, I just want the basic wash and that's it, so please write up my ticket". He seemed annoyed and was rude to me, and practically threw the ticket at me when he was done writing up. I had just picked up a pizza from a local restaurant and said to him, "All of the magazines and stuff on the floor is trash that you can throw away. Do NOT throw away the pizza, that's my dinner!" Ok, so I guess it is my bad for not taking the pizza box with me and carrying it through the building, but I didn't think anything of it. Simple request right?  When I went in to the cashier to pay, they charged me an extra fee for an "SUV" charge. Ok....but I drive a compact car. I drive a Mazda no bigger than a Prius! When I argued it with the cashier and she called the guy at check in & the stupid employee argued that because it had a hatchback, it was an SUV. The cashier and I both rolled our eyes and she dismissed the charge. (The cashier was very nice and professional!)  SO, I head out to the waiting area, where they dry your car off. When they flag me that my car was done, I walk over and what do I see?? They left the magazines that I asked him to throw away and TOSSED MY PIZZA OUT that I had bought for my dinner!!!!!!!!!  By this time, I was pretty mad, so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and after I explain to him what happened, he asked me, "Well, how much did the pizza cost?" Then says, "I will talk to the guy, sorry about that" and walks away. No compensation, nothing!  I don't usually expect free stuff for nothing, and I'm not one to pitch a bitch, but because I was hungry and they threw away my dinner, I was really ticked off! The rudeness of the first employee was not what Jacksons should have as the face of their company! I will never go back!
