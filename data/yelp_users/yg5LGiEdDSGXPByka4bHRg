We went to Joe's yesterday to take my parents out for lunch. We are regulars and normally have a lovely time. However, this time there were some serious issues. All my elderly parents ordered was a bowl of soup each. The soup came out the FIRST time cold--ok, that is understandable. However, when this was explained to the waitress, Eryn, she was incredulous. It seemed to be beyond her grasp this was a possibility, and we must be witches with some sort of power over the space-time continuum because "there is no way the soup could have gotten cold. It just came from the kitchen." After some discussion about the unbelievability of the situation, she agreed to get them new soup.   When she came back for round two ("Ok, this time I saw it poured, and it was steaming!"), once again, the soup was cold. This time I had a taste, and sure enough, it was tepid at best. Eryn was once again astounded, but gave the impression that we were beginning to annoy her with our requests for food served a the proper temperature. By the third try, they finally got it right. While the rest of us had almost finished our meal, their soup came out, and it was hot.  I understand that servers don't have a lot of control over what happens in the kitchen, and I am sure that Eryn was just having a busy lunch rush and didn't mean to appear skeptical and annoyed. However, there was NO visit from the manager to apologize for the problems, and both soups were on the bill. To sum up, it took them three tries to get a bowl of soup right, so my elderly parents had to sit there and watch the rest of us eat for most of the meal, AND they charged me for this experience. Really? No visit from the manager?!?!  I won't be returning to Joe's Crab Shack.

Dr. Eich is so kind and really cares about his patients. I recommend him to all my friends. He is always available for questions, and you can often get in to see him within a 24 hour period, if not on the same day! I think I have been seeing him for about 10 years, and I would never think of leaving.

Oh my sweet, fancy Moses--the food here never disappoints. We had brunch today. There was no wait, and the service was phenomenal. Easily the best meal that we had this time in Vegas. The chilaquiles are not to be missed, smoothest margarita in the world, and if you eat one thing in Vegas, eat those grits. Thank you, Bobby Flay!

I was not expecting the food to be so delicious! Some of the best street tacos that I have ever had! Amazing food, reasonable prices, friendly and crazy fast service! This place is a hidden gem. I have passed it a thousand times--so glad I stopped in!

We have been regulars at this place for years--love the servers! For our last visit, we didn't sit at the Teppanyaki table. There was glass in my fried rice. THERE WAS GLASS IN MY FRIED RICE! It look like some of the pieces of stoneware had chipped off of something. I scratched the roof of my mouth and was bleeding. When I asked for the manager, she decided to "fix the situation" by taking the fried rice off the bill--just the fried rice. I couldn't believe it. Also, they should offer an option to sit at a table without children--what a great way to destroy a nice dinner.

Ana Rinderer is the best yoga teacher I have ever had. She is such a positive and happy presence, and while the class is so much fun, she still works to keep you in alignment and working hard! She truly is a joy! I am only giving four stars because I have seen a small child in a class, which was distracting, and I wish there was a way to keep the bolsters and blankets cleaner. However, overall I really recommend this place!

My burger was raw in the center. The burger was so good that I just ate around it, but this was the difference between 4 and 5 stars.

I went back again to the location on Camelback and my burger was raw AGAIN! For two burgers, one order of fries, and two soft drinks, a $50 bill is completely unreasonable. Especially for raw burgers. We also went to the location in Gilbert--this was better, but only for the reasonable prices of happy hour!

Let's start with the positive: The food and drinks tasted great.  WORST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME. We ordered three margaritas and two orders of tacos, and the bartender charged us for six margaritas and four orders of tacos--plus he charged us for the beer of the guy next to us. When I tried to get him to fix it, he came back with the wrong amount a second time (still over charging us), and the the third time he just ran my credit card without allowing me to see the itemized bill. I was mortified, and he extremely rude.  Also, the people next to me gave their credit card, and when they attempted to get it back, they were told by this same bartender that they never gave him their card. They insisted for thirty minutes, and which point he said to them," NO ONE HERE HAS YOUR CREDIT CARD. YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU GAVE IT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, AND YOU DIDN'T" When another bartender gave them back the card a few minutes later, there was no apology.  Z Tejas is right across the street. The food is delicious and the bartenders are phenomenal. I was just there and without my even saying anything, when the food took over twenty minutes to come out, they comped our entire meal!

Blackberry. Blackberry. It is all about the blackberry. The only problem is: They rarely have it! It really needs to be a regular flavor.

Jason does the best nails I have ever had. It is a beautiful salon and the prices are really reasonable. I hesitated to write a review--only because I don't want the rest of the world to find this gem. It's hard enough to get an appointment now!

I am a takeout regular--even though I should eat here more often. The interior is beautiful! I can't live without the Mediterranean chicken salad, cilantro hummus, chicken shawarma pita, the spicy chicken wrap, and the chicken pasta salad.

Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares? Try "You Don't Know From a Nightmare Until You've Sat at Your Own Bar, Gordon Ramsay."  We went to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill this evening to watch the NBA Playoffs. Things started off well enough--we though the fish and chips were a bit greasy and way overpriced, and the french fries tasted burnt, but this was our first time at this restaurant, so we just thought that they were prepared strangely. When someone next to us was served the same dish, we realized that our french fries HAD been burned beyond all recognition.  We were having a fun time with the bartenders--lots of laughing and jokes. However, one of the bar backs, Antoine, followed my girlfriend when she went to the bathroom. Antoine, is a large, menacing character, and she was not comfortable with his aggressive behavior. When she came back from the bathroom, he came out from the back and handed her his phone number. Later, he said, "You better not have thrown that number away. You better call me or you can't ever come in here again."  At the end of the evening, one of the bartenders, Keith, put two drinks in front of us that we did not order, and said, "Try this." We assumed that he wanted us to try a new drink he was working out--we are very familiar with bars, and it wouldn't be the first time that a bartender had asked us to try his drink. I did not care for mine, so I wasn't drinking it. When Antoine came out again, he said, "What's wrong?" I said that I did not like it. Antoine then proceed to PICK UP MY DRINK, DRINK OUT OF THE STRAW, AND PUT THE DRINK BACK IN FRONT OF ME. I sat, mouth agape with incredulity astounded by his presumptuousness, and all I could manage to utter was, "I don't want that." He then took the drink and said, "I can't drink this out here, but I will take it in the back. Thanks for the drink!" I have never seen anything like this. As I type this, I still cannot fathom that a server (or any other human being) would drink out of a stranger's drink. IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?!?!? Especially in the context of a server and a customer. My head almost exploded. I supposed that it is fortuitous that I was intimidated by Antoine because that spared everyone from me causing a scene.  I called immediately after leaving the restaurant/bar. When I asked to speak to the manager, the hostess who answered the phone said, "Sure! What's your name, Hun?" I am a doctor and a college professor. "Hun?" What year is this?  When I spoke the the manager, there was no greeting on the phone, he just said, "Zeus." It took a few seconds for me to understand that he was actually stating his name, and I wasn't transferred to the wrong number. When I told Zeus the story, his response was, "So, I don't understand--are you saying that Antoine threatened you?" Hopeless--these people are all so hopeless. Zeus assured me that he would take our last two drinks off of the bill and tell the regional manager about Antoine's behavior. I am not really sure how that is an appropriate response to this horrific situation.   So, I guess we won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill, because my friend has no interest in calling Antoine--she couldn't afford to pay for all of his drinks all night anyway.

Could be the best burger in town! Like nothing else! It is not a convenient location, but it is well worth the trip!
