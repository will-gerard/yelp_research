Waited 30 minutes for my French dip to arrive before walking out.  The dirty glasses and silverware did not help either.

Everything tastes so good behind these walls from the seafood to the mason jar drinks.  I am a regular and plan to continue that trend.

Pretty good sandwich, must eat in restaurant though as it will get far to soggy if you take it home. Don't forget that the REAL philly cheesesteak has either white american or cheez whiz so take your provolone business elsewhere.

A friend of mine told me about this diamond in the rough NY style pizza place in the east valley and they did not dissapoint.  I was on my way home from work after picking up the kids when I decided to order some takeout.  I'd read about their pizza, wings and knots special online and thought it would be enough for my family of 6.    Louie answered the phone and took my order, then went another step and asked if I had ordered there before.  I mentioned I was a first timer and he responded by saying that he wished to welcome me to the family :-)  He added that they were going to throw in an extra 6 garlic knots along with my order to say thank you for giving them a try.  Upon my arrival I met Louie at the counter, he shook my hand and said it was a pleasure to meet me and thanked me again for coming in.  My order was ready a few minutes later and I was off.    Now for the food:  I've been living in Arizona for 32 years and in that time I have not had better pizza and wings.  The crust was crunchy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  The cheese was zesty and flavorful while the sauce was super robust with fresh tomato flavor.  BUT THOSE WINGS!....My wife in particular was partial to them, the buffalo sauce tasted truly authentic, we went with the medium for a perfect balance of heat and flavor.    Overall: If you want to feed the family some 5 star food and receive 5 star service yet only have to pay a 1-2 star price, this local eatery needs to be a mainstay for you and yours.  I plan to return very soon.

Due to there being no option for zero stars I suppose 1 will have to do.  Don't waste your time or money on these scam artists.  The food is in no way close to heavenly and the staff there is rude and un-apologetic when you point out they screwed up your order.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.

At first glance it appears to be your normal mid to high end seafood place.  The oysters on the half shell are by far the creme de la creme of what they have to offer.  Expect to pay a hefty premium for them though ($33/dozen or $26/dozen during happy hour).  Tried the Cioppino and was a bit underwhelming, if not for the terrific oysters this would have been a 3 star experience.  For this price, I'll stick to Pappadeax in Phoenix.
