Stand by their work and charge extremely fair prices. People leaving bad reviews on Mr. Hugh's business because he saved Glendale from a bad Coyotes deal are wrong. He's been in business for decades for a reason.

Every time I've walked in with something not working correctly, I've walked out satisfied. Sure the store is busy, but no one's time is not so valuable that waiting 10 extra minutes is unforgivable. I always am taken care of, and at the end of the day that's what I care about.

Not any more expensive than any other coffee shop, and it tastes great. Nice atmosphere too.

Dr. Morton has left and so have I. After opting to go the natural route and come back in 4 weeks for a checkup, and NOT take medication, Dr. Anthony Nelson seemed frustrated at my choice. He typed some notes and hastily said he'd be right back, only to have the nurse come in and say I was all set five minutes later. I didn't see him till 45 minutes after my scheduled appointment and I still had questions, but apparently Dr. Nelson was done with me and my appointment. And so am I with this clinic.

I've gotten great haircuts from Alex, Jason, Ashley and Sidney, but the haircut I got from Natasha today was next level. She was knowledgeable, gave some great styling and hair care advice, and did an incredible job. It's obvious she takes a lot of pride in giving a great haircut. I will absolutely go back. It's nice to have a barbershop of this quality on the west side.
