The pizzas, bread, and dessert we had from Pane Bianco by Chris Bianco were all amazing.  The Wiseguy Pizza $18.00 was as good as I remember it. I realize now that I'm not a huge fan of pre-cooked, wood roasted, or caramelized onions on pizza because it's too sweet for me on pizza, but that's just me. The mozzarella and sausage were still amazing. The pizza crust is one of my favorite crusts out there. It's not too chewy, easy to bite through, and is perfectly cooked in the oven. I appreciated the black pepper grinders at every table.   I don't typically order Margherita Pizza $15.00 because they don't have meat. But I knew that all the ingredients would be top notch, so I went for it. The sauce was very tasty. It tasted like pure pureed tomatoes. The mozzarella was perfectly salted. The basil amount was okay, but I need triple the amount of basil leaves.   Dessert was the Tres Leches cake $7.00. It's probably the best tres leches cake I've ever had. It was slightly cold, which for me is the perfect serving temperature. If I remember correctly, the two different creams - one was a vanilla bean cr√®me anglaise type sauce and the other was like a whipped cream on top. The real vanilla beans made a huge difference. The candied nut topping was also extremely tasty. Overall, it wasn't too sweet which I appreciated. I need to make a similar candied nut topping when I make the cake at home in the future.  Lastly, the complementary bread was so freaking good. I would probably ask for butter instead of olive oil in the future, because butter. I purchased several loaves of bread (baked in the morning) and a can of the chopped tomatoes to take home.    I last visited Pizzeria Bianco about ten years ago. The line was ridiculous and it was cramped and loud inside. The pizza was still amazing though. A good friend told me about Pane Bianco years ago, and I was finally in the area during their business hours. There was no line, and the restaurant was pretty spacious.  Parking is available for free in the back parking lot.

Octane Raceway is awesome and beats several of the other cart places in the Phoenix area. Love that the carts are electric so you don't have to inhale exhaust. You take a couple rounds around and then stop so they can figure out the start order. Then you race for real.   They also have a military discount which is awesome. Try it out!

Our server Emily A. was definitely the most memorable server we've had in a long time, not in a good way.  I can't believe I waited so long to write about her.    Elephant Bar and Grill is Americanized version of Asian food.  The food is edible and there is a good variety to choose from.  Keep an eye out for coupons in your Sunday coupon section.  Unfortunately, our server was totally kooky.  When we had a couple questions about the menu, she would answer randomly and incorrectly as we later found out..  Some entrees come with rice and some come with sushi style (vinegar & sugar) rice.  We gave up on getting any clear answers from her.  When we asked for low sodium soy sauce (the one with the green cap) she said they didn't have any.  We thought that was strange but continued with our lunch.  Then near the end of our meal, she comes out with a low sodium soy sauce bottle and asks with the most unsure, weird expression, "Is THIS what you wanted?"  Yes, that's what we wanted, but now we're almost done eating.  Thanks.  There was also an issue with the bill being calculated incorrectly which the manager had to correct.  The food was okay, but the service is lacking.

Crazy awesome.  Beats all of the California's supermarkets.  Our family has been shopping at Lee Lee for 20+ years.  Owner is very nice and knows every item in the store.  Love the giant price tags.

Chocofin is the ULTIMATE chocolate destination.  It's affordable!  It's unpretentious!!  And it tastes amazing!!!  They have the creamiest and freshest chocolate you will ever find - I think.  I love how the chocolates are kept in a refrigerated case.  Sometimes I eat all the chocolates in the car because I don't want them to melt in the Arizona sun.  I hope Fountain Hills people keep this place alive.  I usually opt for a crappy foam box for my chocolates, but they do have a few options for nice gift boxes.    My favorite chocolates are the Hazelnut Croquantine (yummy crunchiness on the inside, glorious chocolate on the outside) and the Passion Fruit-Blood Orange (it has this surprising center of "pate" de fruit, which is a delicious solid fruit jelly and it's covered in a delicate, thin layer of dark chocolate).  Try a whole bunch of 'em!

Update: I received a yelp message from the new owner of Magen nails saying that they were sorry I received such terrible service from the old management. Best of luck to the new owners and all their clientele.   Terrible!  I'm sad to give any small business a bad review, but I feel like I must warn you.  Three of us visited Magen Nails in Tempe for shellac nails with Groupons. I haven't found a really great salon in Arizona yet, so we thought this might be a great place to try. I ended up tipping off the original price of the services and regret it to this day.  I've had shellac/gel manicures quite a few times, so I feel like I know how they are supposed to go and look in the end.  The three different manicurists who did our nails did an awful job each in their own way.  My mom had a nice lady, who took a really long time on her nails. However, the polish was either not mixed well or something because it turned out incredibly light. In the end, it was questionable whether or not there was even a polish on her nails. The shape of the nails was also poorly done. Uneven all over.  My sister's nails also turned out very weird. The color also looked bad. Uneven color and chunky in some places. Maybe it was our mistake for not insisting on using colors from the name brand bottles like CND. They carry a lot of generic sounding shellac/gel brands. At the time, they didn't carry OPI Gel.  My nails turned out the worst. The male manicurist and possibly the owner (he was bossy and answered the phone repeatedly throughout the manicure) did a completely dry manicure. He didn't have me soak my hands at all. I've heard that dry manicures are actually okay if you have a professional, who knows what they are doing. The reasoning was that soaking the nails in water, painting them, and then drying actually causes the nail to plump up then dry out making the polish weird.   But this guy was careless with the dry manicure and cut my cuticles really deep. Now that I think about it, I don't them he even used cuticle cream (out of laziness?) He ending up cutting my skin right where the skin meets the nail on the side. It bled a lot. Then he carelessly put polish several times right into the cut, which made it sting. It was an overall painful experience. He was barely apologetic in fear I would demand my money back. After it was all over, the cuticles and the skin around my nails look mangled. It was really depressing.   I also must warn you that the ventilation in this salon is awful. I had an instant headache upon walking in. It was a really hot day, but I ended up dragging a chair outside to wait in the 100 degree weather just to get away from it. I know manicurists work hard. Their hands, necks, and backs must hurt and they are breathing in a lot of bad fumes, but this is one salon I cannot support.

Oaxaca was one of our most bizarre dining experiences.  Our good friend adores their food at the airport, so we were anticipating some yummy food.  As many people have noted, their salsa is weird.  Ketchup salsa, yuck.  So we asked our server for "salsa, salsa."  She was confused and returned with a pico de gallo looking bowl.  It turned out to be a partially frozen pico de gallo.  So we gave up.  The entrees including a nacho platter, enchiladas...were okay but nothing memorable.  We sat outside in the patio area and were slowly overtaken by a hoarde of servers/bartenders in black attire milling about before the Saturday club scene.  We watched the place transform from restaurant into a disco complete with creepy managers eyeing the female staff.

Our server was excellent.   She spoke clearly and was very efficient. I believe she got all our orders correct including a substitution.  2 pm "brunch" for our party of 8 after a hike up Camelback Mountain was awesome. All the food was hot, tasty, and arrived at the table around the same time.   I'm really glad I tried their V-18 veggie juice mix. I'm drinking a bottled V-8 spicy juice mix right now at home and it's making me sad. V-8 is watery & weak. BC's V-18 juice is spicy, flavorful, and very fresh tasting.   The eggs benedict with filet worth it. The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned. The server was really nice when I asked if the regular melon fruit cup could be replaced with other fruit due to a melon allergy. Pancakes were pretty solid for restaurant pancakes.  Overall, it was about $20 per person.

The toum (the white garlic spread) is delicious here. I dream about it sometimes. Everything our table of six had was very good. The pita bread was warm, toasty and fresh. Yes, the kinda cafeteria atmosphere is different but the food made up for it.

For about $12 you get a huge portion of customized stir fry and fountain drink for lunch. You can put as much frozen, raw slices of meat and veggies as you want into your bowl and they cook it for you on a large, flat circular grill. The wait is usually no more than 8-10 minutes. YC's is excellent. I've visited many times over the years around the holidays. I usually eat as much as I can at the restaurant and when I fail to eat it all, I buy a to-go container for $0.50 for the leftovers.  It's too bad they haven't resolved the whole sharing or to-go issue after two decades. I'm sad to hear that the employees have been rude and/or confrontational to customers - especially to those who have kids that simply don't eat very much or to people who have much better portion control than myself.    I've never gotten sick (I feel for those who have gotten seriously ill) and I thought they did a good job with keeping the meat shavings/rolls frozen at a safe temperature. Depending on who goes before you in the line, the veggies and sauce can get really messy. I've spilled sauces and dropped veggies all over the counter. Usually, the employees are quick to wipe the counters clean. For food safety reasons, remember to get a sheet or two of the wax paper at the beginning of the line. One to push down the raw meat in your bowl, lol. And another sheet to push down your veggies. And please don't let the veggie tongs or your own fingers come into contact with the contents of your bowl.  I agree with another reviewer's comment that the hot and sour soup was weak. I feel like it has been better in past years. The rice is so-so, but the crispy wonton strips are fun.  Don't forget to check out the cilantro, peanuts, and other toppings right before you give over your bowl to the cooks.   On that note, I recommend tipping the cooks. They work near a very hot grill for hours and have to deal with the ridiculous piles of food we give them.   If you have any food allergies, like a peanut allergy, then this is not the place for you.

Costco gas station hours are not posted on their website. It is open:  Mon-Fri 6 am to 9 pm Sat 7 am to 7 pm Sun 7 am to 7 pm  This Costco is great. After 20 years or so of the family shopping here, I came back and recognize some of the same employees, which is a good sign.

We went here twice on a recent visit to Arizona. Any time we go on a trip and I can try locally made food or a local specialty I'm a happy camper. The ice cream was tasty. For me, it wasn't mind blowingly tasty as some people say. Some of the flavors I tried were interesting.   However, I was a big fan of their waffle bowls. The waffle bowls are crispy and thin enough that you can break it with a plastic spoon. Other places have overly thick waffle bowls that require a small hammer to smash. I also liked that they torch the handmade marshmallow on the S'more Sundae $7.25. The Java Jolt milkshake was also tasty $6.25. A single scoop is $3.00.   The line is pretty slow because they have one employee scooping ice cream AND running the cash register at times (which isn't a great idea for sanitary reasons). Overall, Sweet Republic is decent and is locally made so it gets five stars from me.

My family has been going to Fort McDowell Casino's Red Rock Buffet for over a decade.  That is a lot of dead crabs!  As other yelpers said, if you love snow crab legs and prime rib then this is the buffet for you!  Tip: sign up for the free players club, you'll probably get a discount on your first visit.  The crab legs are hot and steamy!  I find that the crab legs are also better quality and larger than the anemic ones you find at most asian buffets.  In between heaping plates of crab, I usually ask for a super thin slice of prime rib with a dash of the jus.      Yes, waiting in line can get a bit smokey.  I suggest contacting the casino and complaining about the smoke.  People love their cigarettes but who knows, it's possible that one day casinos will be smoke-free.  Good luck trying to find a $14.50 hot crab leg buffet in Vegas.  Enjoy your cheap and delicious snow crab while you have it Arizonans.  It's not that easy to find a great deal like Red Rock Buffet in other states!

$14.50 ($13.50 if you have the free casino player card) for a Saturday crab buffet is awesome. It's not five star restaurant quality but it is darn delicious. Sometimes there's a lull in between them changing the crab tray to a new one.   I only get one set of crab legs at a time because I like to eat them hot/warm.  If you get tired of butter and crab, then try squeezing the lemon wedges and adding black pepper for a new dip.  On some days, they have a special on the crab buffet and it's even cheaper.  At busier times, they use an app on their tablet that will notify you via phone when your table is ready.

If you live in the area, then I would highly recommend visiting Mekong Supermarket especially for your fresh vegetables and fruits purchases.  That said, it's not my favorite Arizona Asian supermarket.  Mekong is a nice sized supermarket with a large seafood and meat counter. Dry and canned goods are plentiful. The cashiers are young, friendly, and fast. If you want to avoid the crowds, then go on weekdays. The free ice and bags after the check out lines are much appreciated and will help keep your meats and seafood cold until you get home.     There are several restaurants and shops in the same plaza, so you can make a day of it if you want.

Xe Do Arizona is a van that goes from Arizona to California - and back - 7 days a week - for $30 each way.    There are three stops/pick up stations in Arizona and two stops/drop off stations in California.  My mom, mom and brother, and friend have traveled to California from Arizona and back using Xe Do Arizona on three different occasions.  My mom enjoyed her trip because all the fellow van-goers were very friendly and the van had many extra seats.  Flying was too expensive, so my mom and brother saved a lot by going on the Vietnamese Van.  Note - you don't have to be Vietnamese to go on the van :) My friend (not Vietnamese) enjoyed his Sunday trip back to Arizona because there were only five fellow van-goers and he sat in the front.  Plus, he loves the sandwiches everyone gets - it's included in your ticket price.  It's wonderful that someone thought of this necessary service.  I hope they stay in business.  All the contact info below is from a flyer I got at the Lee Lee grocery store in Chandler.  Call ahead to reserve a spot.  Times are approximate.  Chinese/English: 480.226.5284 or 714.448.8650 Vietnamese: 480.633.5596, 714.602.0135, or 626.890.2426  From AZ: Chandler 9 am (Lee Lee Supermarket, 2025 N Dobson Rd, AZ 85224) Mesa 9:15 am (Me Kong Supermarket, 66 S Dobson Rd, AZ 85202) Phoenix 9:30 am (Tan Phat Supermarket, 1702 W Camelback, AZ 85015)  Arriving in CA: El Monte 2:45 pm (Thuan Phat Supermarket, 2650 N Rosemead Blvd, CA 91733) Westminster 3:15 pm (My Thuan Supermarket, 8900 Westminster Ave, CA 92683)  ______________________________________  From CA: Westminster 8:30 am El Monte 9 am  Arriving in AZ: Phoenix 2:30 pm Mesa 3 pm Chandler 3:15 pm

It makes me really sad to write this update, but I must inform and warn others.    I made a call and rsvp'd one spot in the van for my friend on a Saturday.  California to Arizona.  I gave the person the name of my friend and my cell number.  The person clearly did not understand my friend's name since it was not a Vietnamese name.  He asked me to spell it and then he gave up writing it down half-way through my "spelling it out slowly."  I confirmed with him at the end of the call: Saturday, one person, name, time, my phone number... the guy said, "yeah, yeah, yeah."    I guess it was my fault for assuming that everything would be okay.  We showed up to drop my friend off and wish him Bon Voyage.  Unfortunately when I came up to the guy to present my friend, the driver was surprised and said "Uh oh."    He literally said, "Uh oh."  This was the beginning of our problems.  He showed me his list of passengers and telephone numbers and my friend's name nor my phone number was nowhere to be found.  He started to accuse me of not really calling to make a reservation.  But at that point death rays were probably coming out of my eyeballs, so he stopped accusing me.  I showed him on my phone exactly which phone number I had called and the driver was still like, "Uh oh."  The driver proceeded to ignore us and hustled to get other passengers' suitcases/bags onto the back of the van.  He was trying to figure out how to make things work in his head, but I could see that this day was a particular busy day for the van and there wasn't going to be space for my friend.  After he was almost done packing the van, I finally said, "You don't have any spots for my friend, do you?"  The driver agreed and I was mad as hell.  I then called a friend and asked about another bus that I had heard of: Xe Do Hoang aka http://www.lowfarebus.com.  We literally sped over to their spot in the ABC Supermarket parking lot immediately and asked about their Arizona bus.  The one guy was like, "Arizona?  Omg, it left already!!!"  He had no idea that we didn't actually make a reservation with them.  But he kindly called the driver and made the driver stop the bus.  He pointed down the street and said the bus stopped for us, "just past the train tracks."  So we hopped back in our car and headed for train tracks.  We had no idea where it was, but then we saw a huge white bus stopped on the side of the road.  The Vietnamese driver was standing there (understandably mildly mad and annoyed) and I quickly wished my friend a good trip.  He ended up having an okay trip back home... NO THANKS TO XE DO ARIZONA.  At one point in my life, I appreciated Xe Do Arizona but now I would recommend you try Xe Do Hoang instead.

We were really happy with the Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna $9.00. It comes with a big salad in the center, which was a nice surprise. I thought that the portion size was good and I would order it again.   We also ordered the Hotty Fiesta Roll $16.00, which features spicy salmon, cream cheese, jalapeno, cucumber, spicy krab, as well as more salmon and sliced jalapeno on top. The toppings were ponzu sauce, sriracha, masago, and green onion. I don't often see salmon-centric rolls other than Philly or Bagel sushi rolls so I really enjoyed  this one. It was very spicy.  Others in our party ordered the chicken bowl $8 and two chicken hot plates $11. Oddly, the middle portion of the chicken (on one of the chicken hot plates) was cold. Is that because they cook the chicken way in advance before putting it on the hot plate? That was really weird. The presentation was good, it reminds me of Chili's fajita dish. But was a bummer that it was partially cold. I would like to hear what others have experienced with their chicken hot plates.  To round out the meal, we also had edamame (basic), gyoza (which were hot and crispy), as well as some chocolate mochi. Overall, Katana is a great addition to Fountain Hill's dining options.

Man do Arizonans love their breakfast! There are so many breakfast restaurants and Butters is definitely one of top places we tried. I loved that they had interesting flavors for their pancakes. It was basically dessert for breakfast. Oreo s'more pancakes? Yes! Banana cream pancakes? Yes! Service was nice and the food was great.  The menu is kind of confusing. If you order the eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and specialty pancakes combo it comes with plenty of food. Wish they would re-write it so it's clear what you get.

Walking up to Sage Bar, we were unsure if we had come to the correct restaurant.  It's definitely more "bar" than "Vietnamese."    We double-checked the address on the Groupon (Rural & Chandler) and then dove into three entrees and an appetizer.  My brother in law saw the white servers and the non-Vietnamese atmosphere and adeptly ordered a burger.  I shared a pho bo and stir fry beef dish with rice.  Pho Bo was okay.  The broth was very sweet in the Southern Viet style.  Beef slices were neither plentiful or scarce.  I don't usually eat that many noodles, but I found the serving to be skimpy.  They used the pho cut of beef (eye of round) in the stir fry which was very strange.  It was served with a sweet soy sauce concoction and we asked for nuoc cham (fish dipping sauce) and we were given a viscous and strangely sweet sauce.  I've never seen a Vietnamese person serve such a thing.  Plus they added an extra charge on the bill for the sauce, wtf.  The tofu appetizer was overpriced and not worth it.  I'm gonna have to buy a $1.30 box of tofu from Lee Lee to erase that dish from my memory.  I'm not sure what atmosphere the owners are going for.  This place gives me a weird feeling in my tummy.  Flat screens everywhere for sports fans.  Seems like if you're a single guy who enjoys Americanized/fusion food and often dines alone then this is the place for you.  If you''re looking for a gastronomic experience you will be underwhelmed.  I won't be coming back to Sage for any Viet food.  If I ever return, I'll stick to the American foods on the menu.  Hopefully they won't charge me extra if I want some ketchup.

An wonderful friend introduced me to Lustre Bar while I was visiting Phoenix. The rooftop bar is located at the Hotel Palomar in Downtown Phoenix, which is kitty-corner from the "Talking Stick" basketball arena.   The view alone is a reason to check this place out. There was a wonderful breeze at night even though it had been over a 100 degrees during the day.  The parking garage is large. Remember to get the bartender or server to VALIDATE your parking ticket. Parking ended up being free since we weren't there for long. Free parking is a huge draw for locals I imagine.   Getting from the parking garage to the actual bar was a maze. We ended up wandering the garage only to learn that you have to switch elevators/elevator lobbies. There could be better signage/maps in the garage.   We had to ask a random guy in the elevator where to go and he kindly led the way. After turning right from the elevators, opening the questionable glass gate/door, and walking up a short flight of stairs, we waltzed right into the impressive rooftop bar. No annoying door guy to deal with, win! There's also another entrance/exit to the bar from the hotel.  Visiting from Florida, I was drawn to the Batida Floridita cocktail, which was actually pretty terrible. The combination of Leblon cachaca, coconut, lime, and cr√®me de menthe was kind of disturbing. I should have known better. The combination of cr√®me de menthe and fruity flavors was not tasty. Other than that, the white sangria I tried was much better. I hope they revamp their menu a bit to include more Arizona inspired cocktails.  The female bartender (one of only two employees running the entire bar) was super nice and down to earth. She stopped by our table, which was far away from the bar/near the pool, several times to give us various menus and drinks. We realized she was having to make a ridiculous amount of trips to us (when the bar was extremely busy) so we ended up walking right up to the bar for faster service from her. I checked in on Yelp to find that there was even a check in discount offer at the time.  A guy stole an cut up piece of apple from the bartender's cutting board, which was not cool. Keep your hands away from their food prep surfaces. The bartender was not happy. Even though she was pissed at the guy, as soon as she turned to serve us she had a smile on her face.  The crowd was lively and seemed to be full of local young professionals after work and a few hotel guests. There were some loud, douchy guys, a few guys wearing bow-ties, nicely dressed women, and a few people playing a bean bag toss game.  As for the view, by the time we received our drinks and got up to check it out - the pool was closed and roped off. I think there might be a better view around the pool area, but I won't know for a long time. During the day, I think you should be able to see South Mountain.  A few weeks later, I get an email from Foder's Travel listing Lustre as one of the top rooftop bars. Woot!  *Tips  *Get your parking ticket validated  *There's a self-service water dispenser at the bar *Check-in using the yelp app in case of discount

So happy that the frozen yogurt craze is dying down.  Snoh is a nice addition to the AZ frozen dairy/dessert scene. It was just before noon in August and blistering hot. My friend and I as well as two large parties awkwardly peered through their windows to find ready but bored teenage employees unapologetically staring at us as we sweated in the sun. It would have been a nice gesture to open  30 seconds earlier than official opening time knowing that 10 people (including two very elderly people) were waiting outside.   The green tea snoh was a light, fluffy, and tiny bit grainy. Unique and enjoyable. My friend's snoh was also tasty and a bit more sweet than mine.  Service could have been a lot better. Would it kill those kids to throw on a fake smile every once in a while? They look so sad.

Loved the concept of Topgolf. Great place to bring non-golfers. Pretty much anyone can do it. The member registration is $5 per person on top of what you pay for a spot, which is kind of a funny charge. If you can remember to save your plastic membership card, then you won't have to pay to get a reprint on a return visit. Overall, everyone had fun. The server was very chill and I appreciate that she wasn't pushy about trying to sell food and drinks. The food reminds me of Chili's or Applebee's type fare and I like that they sell local, Arizona beer.  The staff did such a great job with our large group. We wanted to get the top floor and two adjacent spots and they were very accommodating. There was a little bit of a wait, but it was worth it to have our group together.

$3.67 small, $4.59 medium, $5.45 large  Amanda with the cat eye glasses is probably the most enthusiastic gelato employee ever!!!  We arrived in the middle of the day on a weekday and the place was crowded. Every flavor we tried was delicious and incredibly smooth. Probably one of the best gelaterias I've tried.  They had a few flavors here that I haven't seen anywhere else. The toasted marshmallow flavor was really sugary but still delicious. The displays are beautiful and it was nice to be served by someone who was so upbeat and sweet.

We went here with family over the holidays and it made for a fun outing before heading to the big playground nearby. I was glad to find that they were running a special. Two mix-ins were included in the price of the liquid nitrogen made ice cream. At $4.99 for a medium cup and $6.49 for a large cup I could see how it is pricey, but self serve frozen yogurt places are often just as expensive. With liquid nitrogen ice cream, texture reigns supreme. There were no crunchy ice crystals, it was all very smooth and tasty. I've visited other similar ice cream places that have in-house naturally made flavorings, which is something I hope iCream might pick up on in the future.    They have a free, frequent club card that is used at other businesses, so if you think you might visit here more than once, then I would definitely recommend picking one up.  The employee was very friendly and patient with our large party. It was the middle of the day and there was no line. I could see how the menu placement up high is not ideal. I would suggest picking up one of their paper menus and looking at that instead.

The newer Harkins movie theaters at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall are great. The spacious seats are recline ready (up/down electric buttons). The best feature about the new theaters are the options for online ticketing as well as choosing specific seats online. When we go to movies in groups (8-10 people) the most stressful part is trying to get everyone to the theater at the same time and getting seats together. Online tickets and online seat choices are awesome. At $15 = $14 per ticket + $1 convenience fee this Harkins is pricier than other local theaters. AMC Desert Ridge (also with electric recline seats, online ticketing, online seats) is about $10.00 per ticket. This Harkins no longer has matinee or student discounts, which has angered a lot of locals who used to frequent the old theaters.     The lobby is impressive, but a little but cold and sterile. They tried making the lobby snazzy with the tall ceiling and all the different lights, although the lights coming from the floor can be kind of blinding. They have a separate bar area as well as a separate coffee and gelati stand. The bathrooms are also nice. No complaints about the sound and screen quality. It's great to know that they are continuing to show independent films here as well as the Valley Art theater.
