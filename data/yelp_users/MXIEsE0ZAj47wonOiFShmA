Being a huge fan of pizza I have tried many different places. None of them got it quiet right for me. Yes, they were all edible, and most of them were good, but none of them really seemed to get the whole pizza right for my tastes. I was losing hope of ever finding 'my' pizzeria. Then I saw Nino's reviews on here and decided to try it. And now I believe I have found 'my' pizzeria.  As soon as I walked in, I thought it knew it was going to be a little different. It seemed like a normal pizzeria but also had a small bar, which I am not used to seeing in pizzerias like this. Unlike most of the smaller pizzerias around, they actually had a waitress come over to take my order instead of going up to a counter to order. Not really a big deal but I thought it was a neat touch. I ordered a small personal pizza, sat and waited. The pizza was brought over to my table as soon as it was out of the oven. When I took my first bite, I knew I had found my new pizzeria. The cheese was perfectly gooey but held the toppings and itself onto the pizza nicely. I sauce was not skimped on, nor was it seeping everywhere. And the crust, which I normally pretty picky about, was perfectly thick. Not so thick for it to seem overly bready, nor so thin as to be over powered by the toppings. I then got the bill, which didn't seem like much after the amazing meal, paid and left. My only problem is that they are a bit farther then I would normally drive for a pizza. But I find it totally worth it and I will be bringing others there next time I go.

I was told a few different times about this place called Fez. The way it was told to me, it seemed to be a magical land where gods came down and cooked the perfect burger and sweet potato fries. So when a friend asked if I wanted to go there for lunch, with that mental picture, I readily agreed.  We got there around 6 or 7pm on a Saturday night. Now I am not sure if this is what it is always like, but the place seemed crazy busy. A few tables were being held for a reservation so my friends and I took seats to the side and ordered drinks while waiting for somewhere to open up. We had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table. I was parched and in that time, I believe the waitress refilled my drink 3 times. Even though it was busy, she was on the ball the whole time.  We sat down and quickly ordered, three burgers and a basket of sweet potato fries. The fries came out and here came my biggest complaint. They were a type of chili fries, not sweet potato. I don't know how the order was mixed up, but we thought since it was so busy/were all to easy going/lazy we weren't going to mention it. The fries were good, I was just sort of looking forward to the sweet potato fries. All was quickly forgiven when the burger came out. I could not get over how good this burger was.The mix of BBQ sauce, onions, and feta on top with pears on the bottom, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. There might have been more on this burger but I was to busy eating it and loving every second of my life at that point to really look too closely. I knew those review I had heard and mental picture I conjured were correct, this burger could not have been made by mortals.  I look forward to my next trip here. Next time I go, which I hope is very soon, I will get those legendary fries, maybe try to get a look at those gods in that back that must make those amazing burgers.

I had heard about this great Mexican restaurant called Filiberto's. Some of my friends seemed to talk endlessly about how good of drunk food they have. Last night, I was totally sober and looking for some quick food while on a short break from work. I recalled this location and my friends' words that it had great food. I sort of forgot they said 'drunk' food.   I ordered an enchilada and burrito combo. I really don't know what to say about them besides it was remarkably unremarkable. I am not much of a cook myself but I felt that I could have made the same exact meal with minimal effort, possibly even make it better.  I doubt I'll ever go here again. If I do, I will make sure to be at least slightly intoxicated. Maybe the food will taste better then.

I feel like when I walked out of this place, my hipster cred went up just a bit.  A small independent theater in downtown Mesa. I was pretty happy to see they pick up some of those movies that have just a limited release. (I saw Being Elmo.) They also play old movies, which is fun. Seeing a movie on the big screen is always fun and it's nice to have the opportunity to some older ones back up on the screen, even when it is a movie that I may own. (Such as Die Hard, which was playing after my movie.)   Another note, they have very friendly staff who all seem to care about you having a wonderful movie experience. A really fun time.

My girlfriend and I drove by here the other day and thought it would be neat to try some Scandinavian food. Not that we had any clue what Scandinavian food was. It might have been quicker to fly to Scandinavia to get our meal there but we didn't know this at the time.   Upon arriving at the restaurant with our friends, a host asks if we had a reservation. We didn't know that one was needed but were lucky enough that another group didn't show. Seated at the table and having a minute to glance over the menu, the waitress comes by to ask for our drink orders. Since there was one drink menu and four of us, we asked for another minute. The waitress must have thought we said 45 minutes, cause that was approximately how long it took for her to come back to get our drink orders (During which time we saw another table or two, who had been sitting when we arrived, leave without getting any food or drinks).   We decide to order our meals while the waitress was here since we had plenty of time to look over the menu a few times over at this point. My girlfriend ordered a red wine. Apparently it had the same name as a white wine since that is what the waitress brought back. Upon informing her of the mistake, she says "Oh shit" and leaves, to replace the wine we all assume. We see the waitress at the bar a few times to get other drinks but none come to us. About 30 minutes later, we ask the waitress where the red wine is and she finally replaces it. I guess you need to stress that you want exactly what you ordered when the waitress makes a mistake here. This is soon followed by the main dishes, with my dish missing one of the sides. After pointing out the mistake, the waitress quickly bring back the wrong side for me. Well this can be overlooked since I had never tried any of the sides offered and we all have delicious food to enjoy and share at this point.   After the meal, we ask for the check. The waitress leaves for a few minutes and then returns to get the checks straight. Happy that she is trying to make sure everything is correct, the four of us explain who has what while the waitress writes. She then bring the checks with wrong items on each check. All the items are correct, just on the wrong checks. Happy that we weren't charged for 2 wines, we just settle the difference between friends rather than trying to deal with the waitress again and promptly leave.   I really must give them credit since the food really was delicious. The problem is that the service was so bad. It wasn't even like the place was packed as I noted a handful or more tables that were empty during our meal, with people only leaving during our meal. I don't even know if I would trust a to-go order from here. Not without at least checking that it is all correctly there before going.
