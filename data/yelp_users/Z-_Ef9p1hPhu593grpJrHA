Did my dog get better, yes. Were they able to accommodate me late at night, yes. However, I was really put off by the lack of costumer service. The nurses were very rude with their tone, choice of words and body language. The vet was really nice but I saw her the least out of anyone. I got the vibe the nurses are overworked and underpaid. I doubt I will go back.

I took my phone here back in May to get my screen fixed. I was happy at the time but now I realized that their "repair" was only temporary. They had to remove my screen and take about my phone to fix it. Now, 4 months later my phone is literally coming apart at the seam. I have never had a phone do this before so I am going to assume that the reason it is failing now is the poor service ipro did. I wanted to like them but I will never use them again.

The Vig is my neighborhood bar. It has a fantastic happy hour. The patio is fun and the perfect size. Food and drinks are you above average bar food but still comforting.

I was researching movers when I needed a few things moved from my old house to new one. This company was the most affordable bc they do not have a two hour minimum. Not only are they affordable but Alex and his team are extremely polite and professional. The movers worked hard and still managed to keep a smile on their face. I will use them again!

Walked over with my pup for a morning smoothie. I got the energy elevator. It was delicious and they are dog friendly too! We will be back

Where do I start. I got a single serve at the last farmers market I was at and I was instantly addicted. The coffee is delicious- not bitter like some cold brew. I drink my coffee black but decided to try some Creamer in it and boy am I happy I did. It gave my coffee a rich taste. Not too sweet and def. not artificial sweetener tasting like most coffee shops! Bravo on a great drink. I will now be buying large sized coffee and creamers weekly

Walked over for breakfast and loved it! I ordered an Americano and Toast with bacon Jam and egg. I wasn't too sure what to expect with the toast but I decided to live a little. It was savory and delicious. I look forward to trying all that they have to offer.
