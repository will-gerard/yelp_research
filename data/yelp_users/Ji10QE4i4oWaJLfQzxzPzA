You don't really go to Organ Stop for the pizza.  The organ is fun (especially for Grandma and Grandpa - as well as kids).    Ordering is a bit of an adventure - cattle call ordering line where they give you a number and you come back in another line to pick up your food.  There is also a third line because you can not order your drinks (soda, beer and wine) in the line where you order your pizza.  The pizza is made on a chain belt and is average at best.  I was pleasantly surprised by the lasagna I ordered and the spaghetti looked good but I didn't try it.  The real star of Organ Stop is the organ and the man who plays it.  It may sound corny but it is fun and it is a hoot to see the older gentlemen stand up and salute when they play "Anchors Away", "Nothing can beat the US Air Corp or "The Halls of Montazuma"  In Summary  - average pizza, above average entertainment - worth taking your parents or grandparents to when they visit the Valley!

Easily one of my favorite place in Tempe.  The food is great and a bit original (not your basic south of the border fare).  The atmosphere is nice too (pleasant but with a bit of attitude).    I love Mexican food and these people do it with a unique flare that is worth checking out.  I have been there for lunch a dozen times or so and dinner a few times and never once disappointed!   The only complaint I might make is their parking lot is too small (when that is the worst you can say they are not doing too bad).  In summary great food, great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends for a quick or a long dinner - whatever you are feeling like!

I love this place for inexpensive family fun.    My wife and two kids have been attending movies here for several years and always have a blast.  The price is right and even the concessions are not too expensive (I assume they know if they charge regular movie theater prices for popcorn and soda people would just bring in their own).  Plus you get two movies for the price of 1 as they show double features.  We like to get their early - often bring sandwiches or a pizza and hang out a while before the movie and then kick back on a blanket or our chairs and watch a big giant movie!  Saw How to Train your Dragon last night and even though it was not in 3d it was great - particularly for my 4-year old.  Usually the people in the cars next to you are friendly and it is just a good family fun atmosphere.  We seldom stay for the second movie - I assume many of the families clear out after the first movie as we do.  The only reason I didn't give it a five rating is that the facilities are a bit run down and could use some updating and the grounds could use some lines painted on it to direct traffic and help people figure out where to park (a bit of a free-for-all with people stopping and setting up wherever they want).  But even with that - If you haven't been there for years it is worth going back to - -  and if you have never been there it is worth checking out!

Fancy it ain't, but good it is!  One of my favorite lunch spots even though it is a few miles from the office.  Located in a cheap looking strip mall, you may not think to give it a try but you should.  Prices  are low and food is simple but well prepared.  Their specials are a good way to get  a lot of food at good prices!  Inside decor is not much - except for the brightly painted chairs (go figure the nicest part of the store is the chairs).  If you are in the area give it a try!

I have been to Serrano's several times and had the same experience each time; ok food and not great service.  Each time I have gone I ordered an appetizer and a main course - the first time the main course came out before the appetizer, once the appetizer came out with the meal and the third time it came out less than a minute before the main course.   I get that things happen, but this is a clear pattern.  They also committed one of my largest peeves and made us wait for a table when there were a lot of open set tables.  I have heard from others this is standard operating procedure for them.  At best I would say the food is ok - noting particularly wrong with it, but each time I have been there  - I have left unimpressed by the food.  I am a Mexican food fan and really wanted to like this place (I had heard good things), but in the end bad service and at best ok food - make Serrano's in QC forgettable.

Generally, I do not write reviews after visiting a place one time, but this placed forced an exception.  My wife and I were heading to a movie at the Harkins theatre next door and wanted a bite to eat before the flick started - so we popped into one of the nearest restaurants Ono Hawaiian BBQ (we talked about Rubio's but decided to try something new).  Believe me when I tell you it is not very often that I can not eat the food I have in front of me at dinner time - but this was one of those times (more on that below).  The service at this place was not particularly helpful, but we finally were able to place our order after their employee got off the phone.  Several items were out on their menu and two other items had black magic marker on their sign indicating they were permanently out (I understand changing menus, but this did not look particularly professional).  Once we ordered, we choose to sit at one of their high top tables or at least tried to.  The first one we sat at was dirty so we moved to the second one but then realized that was dirty too (this is in a restaurant with only one table occupied  - should not have have been too busy to keep the place clean.  Ditto for the third and fourth high top we tried.  So we moved to some round tables on the other side of the restaurant - two of the three were dirty there too and the third was in direct sunshine (can't blame the restaurant for the sun).  We did finally find a table with no crumbs, sauce smears or food left on it and sat down.  As we were eating one of the employees came out and cleaned one table, got a phone call and never came out for any of the others.  I ordered the seafood noodle soup and my wife ordered some spare ribs.  The seafood was not fresh, smelled unpleasant and two of the shrimp in it had not be deveined (not appetizing and I was unable to eat given the smell and the appearance).  The same was true of my wife's food - it smelled bad, tasted bad and did not look good.  We would have talked to the manager but at this point no one was around (they were all in the back in the kitchen) and it was not clear any of the people there were management level anyway.  As I said above, it is pretty rare that I can not even choke down a meal - but we tossed it in the garbage and left (ended up having a bag of popcorn at the movies for dinner).  Just because I am on a roll I will also mention that their shaved ice counter was not open - no big deal but it would have been nice if they had not left brooms and mops as well as boxes sitting out in their restaurant.  All -in-all, bad food, inattentive service, unpleasant smells and a dirty unprofessional looking restaurant combined for a wasted $18 of food.  Perhaps we just hit a really bad night for the restaurant, but I know I will not be back.  I

I like this pizza a lot.  Make no mistake it is not a Chicago styyle deep dish.  It is thinn crust - with top notch toppings.  The place is usually a bit crowded and I am not crazy about the atmosphere - tables are a bit tight on top of one another and the bar is pretty pedestrian - though fine.  This is my favorite food choice in the San Tan Village center.  I like all of their pizza combos and think they are all worth trying.  I wish they had a kids menu - that would be helpful for the little ones.  I also wish they had a few more apparizer and salad choices - but what they have is good.   I like the pizze enough for a higher rating - but I would say that it is a bit expensive.  Because the pizza is thin a large can be eaten by two or three people eaisly (i can eat half of one myself without pushing it) it ends up being a bit pricy.  All-in-all a good place and worth your time if you like a thinner, floppy pizza with high quality toppings.

I have to admit that the main reason I wanted to go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles was to figure out the Chicken and Waffles thing.  Perhaps it is my Midwestern sensibility - but it just sounded like an odd combination to me.  I have now been to Lolo's twice - and I still do not know why it works as a combo, but I now know that it works amazingly well.    This was one of those rare places that I wanted to go back to as soon as I finished eating the first time - so I took my family three days later.  The family enjoyed it too.  Since then I am looking forward to my next visit.  The chicken was excellent (I recommend smothered in gravy even though that makes the chicken a bit messy and harder to eat).  The waffles were thin and a bit sweet and served with warm syrup.  The quart jar of kool-aid holds it all together remarkably well.  My wife even said it was the best fried chicken she has every had!  There were two reasons I did not rate it a 5 star;  1)  the restaurant is clean and nice looking but a bit crammed with tables - in addition to the conversation I had with my family I got to enjoy the conversations of the people on the tables to the right and the left of me and , 2)  Although the prices are not bad - the place is not cheap $10 to $14 not including tip and tax or so for a meal including a glass of kool-aid), and it sort of seems like the sort of food you should be bragging about how much food you got for the money.   Neither of these complaints will keep me away because the food was great!  In Summary, great food, great kool-aid, a decent atmosphere.  This is a place  that needs to be tried if you have never tried chicken and waffles and want to (even if you don't want to you should try it).  If you are braver than me and try the plate of deep fried gizzards let me know what you think!

Easily the best Chinese in the San Tan area!  For the past two years I have been disappointed in an area where most consider PandaExpress the height of Oriental eating and am happy now that I have found a place for me. It is one of the few places around where all of the Chinese dishes don,t taste the same.  The business here is mostly take out. There are a few tables in an overly bright entrance room but the place is really designed for to go orders.  I am partial to the General Tso's btw and the steamed are out of this world!   Prices are average for Chinese takeout and as I said the food is top notch.  This place is highly recommended!

I am a big fan of this place.  The food is excellent and the service we have experienced has been beyond friendly and first class.  I read some reviews that said the service was so so - but our food was reasonably quick, it was good and staff were wonderful with our kids!  Even gave them a cheese crisp shaped like Mickey Mouse and some balloons to take home.  This Los Dos is further away from my home than other locations, but when I am in that part of town I will be stopping in!

This is my favorite mexican in town.  The food is fresh alsways good and when they tell you something will be hot and spicy believe it!  The new location is great with a  nice bar and nice rooms with tables.  The staff is friendly and know their stuff.  The recommendation I got was for a beef stacked enchilada dinner with the green chili.  It is now my favorite and I honestly think it is perhaps the best Mexican dish in town.    The only downside is the parking lot.  I do not reallly like a parking lot that is lined with razor wire fences and hard to get in and out of - but I guess if the biggest complaint is the parking lot I can live with it.  Go, enjoy, have the enchilada and enjoy the heat!
