We have traditionally taken our vehicles strictly to the dealerships for any type of repairs. Recently my wife found a coupon for Dean's in the ValuPak. She convinced me to give them a try and we are glad we did.   She celled them to talk about to schedule an appointment. When she got off the phone she just couldn't stop raving about their customer service. That was just the first call. The following day we dropped the car off to them 15 minutes before they opened for the day. Again, great customer service.  The great customer service just kept consistent through our entire experience. Their quality of work has been great and they don't try to push repairs on you.  I didn't use it, but I understand that they offer a shuttle service.  Since writing this review I have received a phone call from them making sure that I was satisfied with their service and received a thank you card in the mail. They continue to impress me. When was the last time you got that level of service from anyone?

My home warranty company assigned them to look into my A/C issues. My experience began with them calling me on Thursday night saying that they would be out on Friday. Someone would call me between 6:30 - 7:30 AM to schedule a block of time for the visit.   8:00 AM Friday morning and I haven't heard from anyone. I called them and they seemed annoyed that I was bothering them with such pesky things as scheduling an A/C repair. Just because it's 115 degrees outside, I have an 18 month old daughter, a pregnant wife and my A/C isn't working doesn't mean I have an emergency.   They gave me a window from 10 AM - 2 PM. @:20 PM I call the office. Again they seemed bothered by my call. The lady puts me on hold while she calls the repairman.  When she comes back on the line she wants me to feel assured that he is still going to make it to my house today. He was in Sun City......I live in Scottsdale. Why did I wait around for 4 hours for them to tell me not to worry he will only be another 2 hours or so?  I can't give you a review on their service because I called another A/C repair company.

SUper knowledgeable and friendly staff will make you feel at home. Teaching a 6 month old to swim can be a bit daunting at times because you don't want to hurt them or scare them, but they are there to support you through it.   Watching all the older kids that have been going there for years reinforces the strong bond that the staff have with the kids. The kids all love going there and they love the instructors. It's a fun and safe environment!

What a DIVE! It's a dive, but it fits perfectly with my image of what a Chicago Dog House should look like. The guy that greeted me at the counter in his white t-shirt (undershirt) further exemplified the Chicago experience.   When you look into the kitchen you can see bags of potatoes. These turned out to be the beginnings of a huge serving of pipping hot, hand cut fires. They were wonderful!  I had a hard time deciding between the tatsy looking pizza and the dog. The dog won and my diet lost. There were so many tremendous attributes to this, what could have been a basic, hot dog. The steamed poppy seed bun was perfectly steamed. The hot dog was tasty. and best of all, I didn't even have to ask for them to add hot peppers to the dog. It came with relish, onions, pickles, jalapenos, salt and pepper on top. WOW!  The entire experience far exceeded my expectations that had been set from first seeing the shabby looking outdoor appearance.

So I continue to find that my wife and I continue to give this place more chances and they continue to dissappoint us. When we placed our order we were very clear with the waitress that they continually over cook our burgers and we detailed how we like them prepared. Guess what........they were both overcooked.   Guess what.........they charged us full proce and didn't even offer an appology.

WOW! I have been coming here for years for the Green Flannel Hash and we have never been disappointed..........UNTIL TODAY.   Both my wife and I noticed it was drastically different today. I asked the waitress "Are they were using a different recipe?"  Waitress: "No. Why?"  Me: "It doesn't taste anything like it usually does."  Waitress: "Oh, does the cornbeef not have any flavor?"  Me: "Yeah."  Waitress: "Oh we've been hearing that a lot from our customers." She walks away and returns with a full bill despite the fact that we didn't like or eat our dishes.

I love the feel of this place as soon as you walk in. I have always found the staff to be very friendly and the food and wine are great.  I have been to Italy at least 7 times and the pizza here is as authentic as it gets! I would recommend......hang on......are you ready for this? The Vegetarian Pizza with Sausage added. I know, I know.....there is a reason for this. The veggies on this pizza are carmelized. Carmelized veggies and sausage are sent from heaven.  It is a great place for a casual date night.

Twice in 1 week you have really let me down. For years I have had nothing but great food and great service. Then.......I called earlier this week to order a chopped salad that my pregnant wife was craving. You weren't serving despite the fact that you were opened.   Then last night was a joke. I ordered take out, chopped salad and a short rib dinner. When I got it home it was a Chopped salad and shirt rib risotto. When I called back in they had no apology just a "Oh we'll be happy to make you a shirt rib dinner." Of course that means I have to drive back downtown.......oh, and did I mention the traffic because of a wine festival?  When I got there, no apologies, no discount, no complimentary dessert........

My faith in humanity and Cowboy Ciao are restored in one fell swoop. Marianne Belardi got back to me regarding my service issues and has made everything good in the world again.  I had recently moved within walking distance of the Ciao and was sad to think that the Cowboy had lost it's swagger. Thankfully, I can still confidently frequent the Ciao because the service is still there. One bad experience versus hundreds of great ones only means they are human.

The staff here are fantastic. I can get nearly everything here that I would get at the mega stores in half the time. The best part is,   "Small business is the heartbeat of local communities and the engine of the US economy. Over the past two decades, small businesses created 65 percent of net new jobs. In addition, for every $100 spent in locally owned independent stores, $68 returns to the community through taxes, payroll, and other expenditures."

I am writing this review as I work my way through this dinning experience. I have enjoyed Cafe Boa in the past, but it has been years.   So far we are off to a good start. The restaurant is decorated in soothing colors, clean and relaxing.  The server is very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Wild Salmon with Basmati Rice and saut√©ed veggies sounds great. Thanks!  Uh oooh! The tea is weak on tea on heavy on hibiscus or jasmine or dandelion, whatever they flavor it with. Oh, and did I mention it's empty...... and they aren't terribly busy and I'm sitting at the bar.   Tick-tock, Tick-tock...for as long as this is taking I'm concerned that my Salmon will be over cooked. It's not that busy people.  Tick-tock, Tick-tock...the wait staff must sense it, because they are leaning half way through the kitchen window looking for food. I guess this is why they have a decent beer and wine selection, gotta keep you happy during the wait. Too bad I'm only drinking iced tea.   Tick-tock, Tick-tock...as I sit and watch larger tables that came in after me being served their food. It's Salmon not rocket science.  The Salmon is a beautiful piece of fish and nearly perfectly cooked. The fish is great but I'm confused on where the chef was going with this dish. It has a "corn relish" on top that is really just corn. It all sits on top of a bed of rice and veggies. The veggies are nicely cooked but they have a Asian flavor that doesn't match the rest of the dish.   Well, I was going to rate it a 3 star until I got my bill and saw they charged me $19.95 for that dish. Definitely not worth it.  Hi all,  The owners response to my original review is below. I did reply back to him directly, but I don't think it will be shown to all so I am adding my response here.Enjoy the reading.    Dear Scott,  Really Scott?  "Tea was full at all times, never empty as you stated" You want to call me a liar? Not a good plan for salvaging relationships with potential customers. Trust me when I say it was empty....I know.   "we understand that you were by yourself" This means there is only one dish to focus on, it's easy.  "the ticket time on the Grilled Salmon was not unreasonable" If this is the case then why was the waiter appologizing for it and why were other tables of 3 people receiving their food before me? If the ticket time was appropriate in your judgement then it is likely that either the server failed to submit the order in  a timely manner or you have a IT/ticketing system issue.   "Your dish, as you stated, was perfectly cooked" Yes the salmon was perfectly cooked and it was a georgeous pice of fish, but beyond the Salmon there was little flavor and what flavors there were, they did not blend together to make a satisfying dish. It was for this reason that the price was unreasonable. It was not a good dish.  "Perfect service and not even a 15% gratuity, really?" Ohhh, I'm sorry you must have missed the part about the empty iced tea, long wait, other more complex orders for a larger group of people coming out before mine, a main dish that the flavors didn't blend well and ice tea that I didn't like. I am a tipper that over gives and you have to work hard to get less than 20%. That tip was an earned tip plus a generous donation considering the experience.  Your response has helped solidify my 2 star rating of Cafe Boa.   Gary S.  Hi all,  One last update from me. I thought you might be interested in seeing the private note that the owner of Cafe Boa sent to me as a response to my last posting.  Cheers,   Gary S.  From: Scott R. Owner To: Gary S.   "I apologize for my following tone, but your response warrants the following: My response isnt to make you change your rating, it really doesnt matter to me,  most normal people know when some reviews are legit and reasonable and some are just ridiculous and silly. We have thrived for 16+ years, no thanks to people like you. The fact of the matter is that your experience was Flawless, we serviced you with perfection,.. you were just looking to trash our establishment. Most of your comments above arent worth responding to, they are so silly.  We served you in a timely manner, albeit not as fast as you wanted, a high quality meal with friendly service and in return you sit there at our Bar during your entire meal, typing on Yelp any flaw you could find, wow, kinda sad, really. If you are a food critic, ok then I would understand, otherwise, get a life. We will be here for another 16+ years, you can count on that."  Hi all,  Dear Scott R.,  Using my full name in your public reponse is yet more proof of your poor ethical standards. So all reading please be aware that if Scott R. doesn't take well to your critical feedback that he will take your name from your credit card receipt and try to smear you online. Good luck Scott!  Gary S.  Gary S.

We have been here so many times and every time it is great food and great service.  This time we did get one meal that was very bland. I brought it to the servers attention. On the way back from the restroom the manager stopped me to shake my hand and thank me for brining it to their attention. "I would rather find out these issues early in the morning (it was early morning) than go through the entire day serving bland food." We then later overhead him talking to the kitchen staff and asking if that dish had been adjusted. They also took care of a portion of the bill.  Timely, kind and sincere response to a negative customer experience will always keep me coming back. Every restaurant will have it's issues from time to time, but it is all in how they respond to them. This managers actions and demeanor where the true example of customer service.

These 4 stars are all based on expectations. What do you expect when you go to Greasewood Flats? What are your expectations when you go to a bar that has mostly outdoor seating; Picnic tables; open fire pits; Horseshoe pitches; Donkeys; Roosters; One man band; limited food menu; serves only beer and sodas;  and is filled with bikers, cowboys and lesser so tourists. This is everything that you expect from Greasewood Flats.   The atmosphere is so relaxed that I think you would be hard pressed to find a more caasual environment. Everyone is just having a good time hanging out with friends.   The Green chile and bacon cheeseburger is a great idea, but the only way they cook the burgers is to medium. Medium is overcooked in my book and the medium that I got was actually Well done. Again, it's about expectations. I came here to hang out with friends and family and enjoy the day.

I eat here twice a month because it os close to work, but it's worth the drive from any where. It is one of the best BBQ joints I've eaten at. Staff are friendly and the service is good. I need to eat here sometime when I'm not working so I can enjoy a bevie. It's has a fun decor that is probably enhanced with alcohol. ;-)

I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them!   A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these.  I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful.   Service was great! I'll be back!

Funny, the first time that I attain a "Dukedom", it's to a place that I'm not really pleased with. I attained this status by having to take my bike back several times for the same BASIC repair.   I took my bike in for a tune up primarily because it was not shifting appropriately. When I dropped it off the entire staff was very busy watching the Tour De France. They said they might be able to get it to it that day. Two days later I had to call them asking them if my bike was done. "Oh yeah we finished it at 4:30 last night."   Apparently they finished it closer to closing time than that because who ever "fixed it" didn't bother taking it for a test ride. Unfortunately I discovered this on a 15 mile desert ride. it was a rough ride.  The next day when I took it back, I believe it was the manager manning the shop. He was busy with a customer when i came in. I have no problem with only 1 person manning the shop on a weekday afternoon, I don't have a problem with the fact that he was busy, but I do have an issue when someone doesn't even bother to acknowledge you. Customer service rule #1 acknowledge your customer. Just say hello and tell me that you will be with me as soon as you can. I waited for about 15 minutes before someone else came into the shop and helped me.   Apparently the person that took the bike from me didn't pass on the fact that this was a return issue. When I went to pick up the bike again they tried to charge me for the repairs.   Guess what.........IT"S STILL NOT FIXED.

Interesting......so many of the reviews below talk about attitude. A couple of thoughts on that. First, i have been there several times and they have been nothing but friendly, genuine and sincere. Do they sound a bit rough due to ESL and cultural tone? Sure. If you don't like that type of tone go to the Olive Garden where you won't run into a single true Italian. Second thought is, what did you do to piss them off? I think the tone and attitude in this market is exactly what I expect from a true Italian market. I have been to Italy 6 times and this is genuine Italian. You fellow patrons will likely be speaking Italian.  The food is incredible. I am not a big fan of eggplant. my wife asked me to try her eggplant sandwich and it was the best eggplant I have ever had. I will probably order that next time I am in. I had the Porchetta (Pork Sandwich) and the pork was perfectly cooked and the bread is fresh. The Maningota is what we really go here for. Make sure you save room for dessert!  THe groceries that they offer are very limited, but they are everything you would need for an authentic Italian meal. They are also ingredients that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.

I bought 2 refrigerators, a washer, a dryer and an Reverse Osmosis system from them about 2 months ago. I have experienced several minor issues with them that have become big issues because I can hardly get our salesperson Paul to return our calls.   The first issue was when our fridge was making a sound that you could hear throughout the ENTIRE house. I called in for mechanical support on a Saturday and they told me that I would have to wait until Monday for service. It was an issue that couldn't wait out the weekend. I asked them to escalate the issue to a GM or owner and they said they are not available on the weekends. This issue did not get solved by them.  I then received a bill from a third party installation company for the installation of of our RO system. The problem is that we paid Spencers for the installation. Since that time I have had several calls with Spencers in an attempt to resolve the issue.   A couple of weeks later I called to talk to Paul about a discount that had failed to be applied to our purchase. As soon as he heard that it was me he went into assuring me that the billing issue was resolved.  Last week, guess what? I got a collections threat from the third party vendor that Spencers had supposedly resolved this billing issue with. I called in to Spencers on Wednesday night and left a message for Paul to call me. Fast forward to Saturday, guess what no call from Paul. I then called Spencers and now Paul is on vacation. I then asked to talk to the GM. "I am sorry we don't have a GM on duty over the weekends. He will be in on Tuesday." Ohhh, the GM must be out celebrating a long weekend. Maybe it is a little known retailers holiday like "Double Billing Days?" How do you not have a Manager or Tech people on call at least over the weekends?  I have utilized their website "contact us" e-mail address and have still not heard back from anyone.   Let's see did I miss anything? Misbilled Discount not applied No Tech/Mechanical support on Saturday afternoons or all day Sundays No Managers on duty on the weekend Sales Person not returning calls  No, I think that pretty much covers it. Oh yeah, did I tell you that my in-laws bought a full house worth of appliances prior to us buying? Considering we have probably paid for Pauls vacation this year you would think we could get a call back from someone.

Since posting my previous review, I have had some interaction with Spencers. The Store Manager from Scottsdale called me. Instead of hearing out my concern, acknowledging my concerns and then addressing it he just tried to justify what he could and had no response for those things that he couldn't make an excuse for. My issue was eventually resolved.   Paul, my sales person, he should have received a message from me on Wednesday. He went on vacation on Saturday knowing that my issues were unresolved and he didn't bother calling me.  Someone by the name of Wayne did call and leave a message. I think he overseas all the operations. I tried calling him back yesterday morning. He has not bothered to return my call.   I am in customer service and the number 1 rule for me is to call the customer immediately. Even if you don't have all the answers for them, at least call them, hear their concerns, acknowledge their concerns and then tell them about your action plan to bring them to resolution. This seems to be a very foreign concept.

I love Pita Jungle! I frequent the one on Indian School and 40th street, but make it around to the one in Peoria and the one on Shea. Regardless which one I go to the service is great, the food is fantastic and the crowd and atmosphere has wonderfully warm energy.  The only thing that I have not enjoyed greatly was the Broiled Chicken Pita. It was a little bland. I have tried so many other dishes and they are all wonderful.  Love you guys!!!

Great service and the food was spiced perfectly.....better than most any other restaurant than I have ever been to.   The eggs puzzle me though. They cook their eggs on WAY too high of heat on the morning that I was there. I literally couldn't cut through the eggs with a fork. When I brought it to the servers attention she gladly brought me back a reorder, but the reorder only had 1 egg versus 2. The reordered egg was still inedible from being fried on WAY too high of heat.  Everything else was fantastic. Oh, and did I mention really hot servers?

It is really sad to have to write a 1 star review for this place. The food 4 stars, the fact that it is family own and run is a 5 stars, but service that I have received from the manager, David is a -3 stars.   On the first day that the Yelp coupon was released I bought it and used it. When I checked out, the cashier was confused because I was the first one to use the coupon. I later discovered that she originally charged my cards for the full price, $34.18. She then charged my card for $26.04. I know my math skills are a little rusty, but that is not a $14.00 discount, plus I was charged twice. That is not where the major problem lies.   The major problem was that I had to make several phone calls attempting to get a hold of the owner or manager. When I finally did get a hold of David he told me that he did not call me back because he did not know who I was or what I wanted. He also stated that I "should have left him a message about what my concern was." First David, you should call everyone back regardless of if they leave a detailed message. Secondly, I was not about to leave a detailed message because the person that answered the phone each time struggled with their English to the point that they could hardly handle my name and phone number. I have no problem with the fact that they struggled with English, but don't provide me with poor service by not calling me back because I didn't leave a message under these circumstances.  Here we are more than 2 weeks later and I still am struggling to get my money back. If the owner reads this, then it would behoove you to reach out to me to resolve this. We were so excited to have found your place just 2 months ago. We were on our way to being devout customers, but this might have changed that, primarily due to David's attitude with me.

We used to shop at the other big baby store, but we had so many bad experiences that we decided to drive the extra distance and try out "buybuy Baby." Since that time we have been lured back into the other store by gift cards and great coupons, but found that even with those attractive offers we still regretted going back.  "buybuy Baby's" service is top notch. Their staff are very knowledgeable about the safety products. Everyone is over the top helpful and nice.  We have also found that we like the products at "buybuy Baby" better.

Can bread and butter really be opulent? I just found the answer to my question. Yes. The bread is smooth, soft, warm and perfectly cooked (crunchy and soft). The "white Bread" is actually an asiago roll roll with a crunchy top.  We then moved on to the Gazpacho which was a perfect blend of coolness and hidden heat. It was a wonderful teaser for all the other flavors to come. The specials looked incredible, but we have some fellow foodies that raved about the Mussels and the Short Ribs. The mussels had a sweetness that I have never experienced with Mussels. It was star anise and while it was a bit perplexing it kept me coming back for more. My wife and I were supposed to share, but she really didn't want to share her Mussels.  The short ribs were wonderfully flavorful and perfectly cooked. Normally in a restaurant you often experience a great main dish with some weak accompaniments. This was not the case. The mashed potatoes, sauce and beans were exquisite.  The ambiance, service and vibe were topped of the experience. We didn't bring our daughter with us, but we were very impressed with the kids menu. We will bring her next time. This will be our new regular hang out.

The seasonal veggie sandwich was incredible. Roasted carrots, green, caramelized red onion, pumpkins seeds and feta cheese on an exquisite bread.   It was served with Sweet Potato chips that were a little too greasy and salty, but I guess that is what made me eat every last one. Mmmmmmmm   Their dessert menu was very tempting, but my resolve was strong. I would love to come back in the evening for a nice evening with my wife.

If your looking for something chewier than beef jerky then try the short ribs. Jerky has more flavor but I think I lost weight trying to put this meal down.   The BBQ Chicken (chicken like product?) was so processed it was flavorless and texture free.   The other meat product that came on the #8 special was the toughest of all.   Now take all of these items and drown them in a sugar based sauce and you've got a real desperate mans treat.   Avoid this place!

Everything was a wonderful experience from the valet that received my car to the ice cream lady at Churn. Service was friendly, prompt and professional.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting and it just has a great vibe.   Now to top it all off the Reuben was the best that I have ever had. Kind of funny when you think about it. How good or classy can a Reuben be? This Rueben takes you beyond the typical greasy low quality experience. The pastrami is some of the best that I have ever tasted, The sandwich was elequently done.   I would highly recommend this place for a lunch with really good friends. It just adds to the experience of being with the ones that you love.
