I don't really write reviews, this hotel sucks!!!  First night chair is broken and it smelt soo bad!!! Had to bring an air freshener. Next day the shower is leaking and blow dryer is broken...so we complained the next day and wanted to get a refuns on the 2nd night..they won't give it to us!!!! Just part of it....$300 for 2 nights?!?! What a joke!!!! DON'T EVER COME HERE!!!!!
