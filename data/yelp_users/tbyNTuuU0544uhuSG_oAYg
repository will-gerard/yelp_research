I am told that this place started out as a great place to eat. While this may be true, things have certainly changed for Pacific. The whole place smells horribly like fish (Keep in mind that properly prepared fish does not smell fishy.) and the restaurant was gross. I spent my time trying to find something to eat that wouldn't gross me out which was a waste of time. I left terrified that my next few hours would find me hunched over a toilet bowl. Don't go here.

I've tried several times to eat oysters and it has ended poorly each time. My dad is a huge fan and he prefers to fry them. Still, I'd heard that some people eat them raw and have wanted to try them that way for a while. It was an adventure for both of us, but my dad and I shared an order of raw oysters. That is some of the best food the sea has to offer.  In addition to the oysters of which we ordered another plate, I also tried the clam chowder and loved that as well. This place is pretty pricey, but good seafood in Arizona is hard to come by. I will return for another plate of raw oysters as soon as I can.

I was very impressed by these guys. They spent a lot of time making sure they got the diagnosis right and when they gave me the bill, I was surprised at how inexpensive it was. I'm new to the west valley, so it is great to find a trustworthy mechanic already.
