Still, and I have moved quite a bit, my favorite brewery in all the land!  Lets see, I've been here for pretty much every occasion- my Birthday (for a few years), when I visited ASU recently, my ASU graduation lunch, Happy Hour after class, date nights... you name it!  As you can probably tell, I love this place.  Service is always on point, regardless of where you are seated (and I've been seated pretty much everywhere).  You have a full view of the brewery if you sit at the bar or on the opposing side of the entrance, it's pretty spectacular.  If you sit on the far side, past the bar to the right, you'll have excellent TV viewing and nice tables for larger parties (really popular during games).  Besides the seated area in the back near where the brewing takes place and the outdoor area it is 'seat yourself'.  The food is nothing short of perfection, I don't believe I've ever had a bad dish while at this glorious location and the beers!  My favorite dish (although I do not know if it is still available) is the salmon sandwich- there was some sort of glorious concoction of pesto mayo that makes my heart flutter.  Ah yes, das boot! Most would go for a kiltlifter, I feel as if it's a people pleaser, if you have a large party and you want to order a pitcher but you don't know what everyone prefers-go for it.  You also have to make the kilt lifter a staple in your beer flight, which you should definitely order if you're a first timer.  My personal favorite is the peach,  the peach brings me back to college days by the pool with a growler-its just so refreshing.  They have a beer for everyone here, plus a full bar so each guest is sublimely happy.  Growlers are great take homes (and check bag PHX friendly mind you) for about 5-7 days cost about $15 the first time and $10.00 for a refill.  All in all, I make it a mission to visit this amazing establishment each time I am in the area-even if it's just a layover at the airport I try to find a bar with some Four Peaks on tap.  If you're in the area and you're craving a great beer, good grub, and a hometown feel-check it out!  They also have a happy hour in which appetizers and beers have some discounts.  Plus, if you're a dessert-y person they have an oatmeal stout shake with all sorts of deliciousness encompassed.

Oh my word, did I spend most days after class here!  Their happy hour is fantastic, the sushi is always delicious and the sake... oh the sake! I also brought people here who visited me in the desert, they loved it as well.  All in all I love this place, every time I visit ASU I have to stop by for a nicely priced roll and sake bombs!  I highly recommend it, it was delicious and affordable on a college student's budget-what more could you ask for?!

Parking is a nightmare.  The lines are ridiculous. The people who work there are great but their process is at an incompetent snail's pace. I've taken two classes from here in order to finish my ASU degree in the 4 year time span and boy was that a mistake.  The Professors (could you even call them that?) were wretched, especially ASL IV, and sending my transcripts to schools besides those in the state is still horrendous.  I sent out transcripts in November 2015 and they still haven't been received.  *Rio Salado asked me to expand on my review, sure. 1. Well parking was always a nightmare for me, I don't believe expansion is necessary.  2. The two classes I took were horrible.   -The first one was a math class and it really didn't teach me anything, the lessons were repetitive per year so the ability to find out what the next week was going to entail was easy.  The content itself was from High School, nothing new. -The second class I took was ASL IV.  The instructor was blatantly wrong on some of her signs and due me pointing them out she held a grudge.  I wrote the final paper, which was an opinion piece on Deaf Culture and she gave me an F on the assignment, I used relevant facts, information from my ASL professor at ASU (the only reason I didn't take it from ASU was that I needed 4 additional credits to graduate in the spring semester and this was the class available elsewhere since it was still 200 level), used information from the book we were assigned... pretty basic stuff I thought.  I remember reading her reason for failing me and she stated, "the Deaf don't think that way, you didn't do your research."  I was appalled, taken aback,  I mean ... I didn't know my opinion piece could be wrong?  Was I supposed to be less creative, less understanding, and less opinionated?  Personally I don't think this is what college is about, when you ask for an opinion piece-you ask for a personal opinion supported by research/facts.  At least, thats what I had been taught throughout my educational career.  I reached out to the Rio Salado staff and they did nothing about it, they explained they could do nothing about it.  I ran the paper by my current ASU professor and she couldn't see a problem with me taking the unlikely/opposing stance when the Rio Salado Instructor specifically asked for an opinion with supporting research.   3. All in all, I learned nothing from either course except that I should ultimately conform to tyranny and uneducated personnel. Honestly, I believe I may have taught the teacher a few signs, I mean she signed like a High School student, bouncing her letters and exaggerating all of her signs.  The first exam I got a C because "my signs were not clear," mind you I got an A+ in ASL I-III and I was auditing the ASL IV class at ASU simultaneously.  4. Transcripts, I had them sent through the online system after speaking with the staff directly. Low and behold they lost them-either in the mail/forgot to send them, I have no idea... this began two months ago and my graduate programs still have not received my transcripts.  This ordeal in particular prompted this review.   -I had two transcripts sent from here, both to the state of California (UC Schools) for graduate studies.  I have now been forced to delay my application A FULL YEAR due to one of the schools not receiving it in time and another A FULL SEMESTER simply because the transcripts were never received.  I called them yesterday and they said, "you had an email address on there too-it is confusing, please apply for another one."  Really. Really, I had an email address on there as the second line of the address for a person of contact.  Aka for the mailman at the college to be able to find the individual it was going to easier.  First off, you couldn't call me to ask me to elaborate if you were confused?  You couldn't alert me that my transcripts would be delayed due to this?  Do I need to fly to Arizona to personally hold your hand for through this process so I can ensure it is done correctly?  I sent it again yesterday and called them right after, they stated that it would be sent out "soon" I explained it needed to be rushed in that this mishap was on them and she comeback with (after the longest pause in all eternity) well, "today or tomorrow."  I'll call back today to see what happened, I can't fathom that I'm the only person this has happened to and if this school really wants to help the students, they should also add a 'rush processing option' so that I may select it and they could refund me for their under active personnel.   TL;DR: All in all, don't take classes from here or interact with them in any way unless it is absolutely necessary.

Definitely hit or miss like the previous review stated, although you're bound to find something amazing. A few tips: 1. devote time to browse the entire store- you never know what you'll find.  2. carefully check everything. 3. do not be rude to the workers, they try their best. 4. be prepared when you get to the front of the checkout line. 5. wear clothes that are easy to slip on and off to try stuff on easier. 6. always end with shoes, it's so much easier and less worrisome (unless you only plan to buy shoes) when you go to try stuff on and you come out and boom, all your coveted shoes have been taken from you by another patron. 7. look for the sales! Yes, they have sales on sales and you could possibly get a dress or a sweater for under $3.00. 8. have fun, bring friends, work as a team!

For an In N Out, this one takes the cake.  I've never had a mistake order from here nor any problems. There is always a line... I mean always... they even have to turn away people after they have closed!  The food is your typical in n out deliciousness and the staff is quite obliging.  I actually met "Johnny Cupcakes" here once while he was staying at the hotel next door. Parking is acceptable and getting in and out (lol) of here is pretty standard if you go the back way, the light by the freeway is a nightmare.

WOB WOB WOB!  I had an old friend who worked here after I graduated from ASU in 2012 so I payed her a vista and boy was it great!  So many beer options... and I'm indecisive, I had to get 3 different ones on tap! Service, after she left, was actually pretty poor which caused my star deduction.  Other than that I love the options here and the ability to get either a bottle or tap is nice.   All in all, if craving a weird beer from away place I would stop by when I'm in the area.
