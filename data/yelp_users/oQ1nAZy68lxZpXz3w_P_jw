Great Chinese food with quality white meat and no gristle!

Cox Communications consistently raises their prices. High speed Internet Preferred used to be $35 a few years ago but it constantly goes up, from last year's $56 price to January 2014's $63. Their "choices" jump from a ridiculously slow 5MB package at $48 to an overkill 50MB package at $63 with no speeds in between.  I switched TV by going to Costco and signing up with DirecTV (received a $300 Costco gift card and a big 2 year service discount) and now I'm switching to CenturyLink for Internet and an additional $5 bundled discount.  12MB Internet is only $20/month for the first year and then $45/month after that.

We hired Suzanne to help us select interior paint colors and reupholster a rocking chair and 4 office chairs. She did a great job and we love the results.

Very nice leather seats, minimal crowds, great parking, and killer paninis.  Much less hectic crowds and parking than Tempe Marketplace.  Matin√©e prices are only $7.50 which is very reasonable.  My only gripe is that they don't take American Express... isn't this place supposed to be high-end?

Great atmosphere for this part of Scottsdale although the parking can be challenging. Highly recommend the lasagna and the garlic bread that comes with it. I'll be coming back!

Rob was able to clean my carpets the same day I called him. He was very personable, does great work, and charges a reasonable price. I highly recommend him.

Darren knows his stuff!  Scottsdale CPAS is good for tax preparation but they are also very helpful with overall tax strategy.
