My husband and I were out in a different part of town than usual and found this gem through Yelp. Great food and good prices.  We really liked it.

I've gone to N'Joy quite a few times recently. I love their pedicures, eye brow waxing, and they have a great kids' pedi that includes art. For the 4th of July my girls' got red and blue toes with white stars. For back to school they got their school colors, red and black, with white flowers. They are also really sweet with my two year old that I keep next to me in her stroller.

I love Chick-fil-A. Their food is good, but their customer service and staff are incredible. With their help we pulled off an amazing fundraiser for my daughter's teacher who is fighting cancer. We had a busy night and they kept everything running perfectly. Thank you Robert, Stephanie, and the rest of your staff!

We stopped here to pick up gift cards for teacher thank you gifts. After 20 minutes (and us calling back) they came out to tell us they were out of gift cards. I'm not sure why it took them 20 minutes to figure that out. I've also had experiances of broken stalls, and messed up orders at this location. We are HUGE Sonic fans, especially to head up for happy hour right after I pick my girls up from school, but we now go out of our way to skip this location.

December 23rd and one register open with a line wrapping around the store. But there are employees just wandering around the store.  When we finally got to the register, my husband caught them over charging us.

Barro's is our favorite pizza for family night and we love their generous and meaty boneless wings.
