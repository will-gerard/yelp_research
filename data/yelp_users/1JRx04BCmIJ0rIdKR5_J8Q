After waiting in line just to get a token to use the restroom, a rude employee approached me on the way out of the restroom, then I had to wait in line all over again just to order. Shortly after that, I watched a grandmother experience the same thing with her grandson.

What a fantastic place! Great food and drinks, very nice ambience, hospitable and reasonably priced, and definitely my favorite Bloody Mary's!!! The chicken Marsala is amazing and the seasoning is the best I've had. If you want authentic Italian food in Phoenix look no further. The desserts are the best part. All home made and delicious, do yourself a favor and come to Sapori D'Italia!
