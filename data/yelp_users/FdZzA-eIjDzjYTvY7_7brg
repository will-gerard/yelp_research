Steer clear.   We waited all day on a weekend for the company rep to arrive for a scheduled visit. Called them, no answer. No show. No reply.   Called them again on Monday. The rep said they'd gone to another property and insisted that I had given him another name (of a person I have never heard of).  He finally "found" our service request but didn't apologize for their error. I rescheduled anyway. This time, the rep arrived (an hour late). He took photos of the earth where we have a water leak, touched nothing, and left saying it would be a minimum charge of almost $500 to investigate the leak, which they could perhaps do another time. No thanks.   Wish I'd checked Yelp before calling them--and it was a home warranty referral initially. Lesson learned.

Tucked inside an unassuming office park in south-central Tempe, Laughing Buddha Yoga studio is a hidden gem: once encountered, not forgotten. The welcoming studio space is lovingly designed with skylights, natural cork flooring, and lush green plants, and attention is given to detail throughout the common areas and changing rooms. The energy is clear and bright--open peace and genuine smiles go hand in hand without a feather of pretension or elitism.   But the teachings are number one: experienced instructors, small class sizes offering serious individual attention, and a careful balance between the physical and meditative aspects of practice. The students tend to be experienced as well, and classes can be both challenging and surprising even to those who've been practicing a decade or more. LB offers a range of classes, from flow to restorative, and the instructors guide students of all levels with care and enthusiasm.   LB  would be a wonderful place to start an enduring practice, or to continue it. Give yourself a gift and check out this community-centered studio with an enormous heart.  P.S. No, I don't work for these guys. Just a long-time yoga student and a serious new fan. :)

Just finishing my leftovers from last night's delicious dinner and felt moved to send out some virtual praise. Yes, the extras were that good. Here's the deal: for the price, the best pasta and salad place in town. Yes, there are more upscale restaurants, but for $11 total, I had a bowl of the following amazing salad--spinach, baby kale, arugula, with hazelnuts, diced pears, blue cheese, dried cranberries, and red onion, all lightly dressed and nicely balanced...AND a bowl of creamy mushroom Marsala pasta, which was rich but not overly heavy. The house wine was ok, about what you'd expect for five bucks. The service was cheerful and attentive. Overall, a nice local place, not pretentious, and very good at what they do. And yes, plenty of good vegetarian options. Hurrah!
