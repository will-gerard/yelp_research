This is a review I tried not to write. I went to Seamus on Holloween night and proceeded to have a good time. I brought 5 other paying customers who also were enjoying them selves until I was harrased by an off duty bartender who worked there. To truly understand what happened a little back story is necessary. About three months a go at a completely different bar not associated with Seamus. I was acosted and harrased by this same bartender due to her boyfriend at the time being confused with his sexuality. She was upset at me because in a private conversation with her boyfriend I told him to embrace his homosexuality and be honest with his girlfriend.  To be respectful to this completly disrespectful establishment I will leave out names except for the GM of Seamus that I was finally able to speak to. Back to the story...why the boyfriend went and told the girlfriend about our discussion I'm not sure. Needless to say I was immediately approached by her and accused of trying to take her guy. This ended in an argument and me being physically attacked by both of them. Flash foward to November 31st 2014. Like I said i went into Seamus and proceeded to have a good time. While in the bar I get approached again by the above mentioned boyfriend who made a joke that he and i should go "make out in the bathroom". Knowing that he was being sarcastic he and i laughed it off, we apologized to each for the incident three months ago, gave each other a hug and decided to let bygones be bygones. Not 10 minutes later i was approached again by the same girlfriend who began speaking and wanting to argue with me about the last time she harrased me. My exact words to her were "honey, have a good night, i dont have time for this, speak to your boyfriend". As I'm walking away from her she states "oh yeah well your out of here". I didnt know at the time that she worked there. Next thing i know a bouncer comes to me and tells me i have to go.   This is not ok. By any means. I called the manager the next day and explained my situation. The manager i spoke to then knew exactly who i was speaking about and was immediately appaled and apologetic. He told me that i would be taken care of and thank me for calling before i went social media. The gm that was supposed to contact me was Malydia. I didnt hear anything from her until i had to call again three days later only to find that i wasnt going to get a call.  She told me that she was siding with her bartender and and hung the phone up on me. Terrible.   It didnt even come to my attention until friends of mine who heard the story told me the reason i was kicked out was for being a homosexual male. I will never step foot into this establishment again. I suggest any male who is gay stay away from here as well as long as that confused and angry bartender is still employed there. its sad because i heard great things of the owners but the people they have running this place disgust me. The name should be changed from Seamus to Shame-us. I will be sending this story to 3 on your side.   Stay clear from this place.

BTW Again I don't like doing bad reviews or even do reviews if I can let the business know how they are being represented. To End My Shameful Seamus Experience (read my first review on this place). I reported them to the BBB and have a complaint on file that the owner is to respond to by a certain time. By no surprise that time line passed and I recieved an email from the BBB asking if they had responded and then an apology when they hadn't. I honestly didn't care about this anymore and truly forgot about it because Seamus is a laughable attempt at the idea of a neighborhood bar of which, and here's the funny part, that I'm 86'd from for life. I never went there! No judgment on any of the customers as many of them are friends or aquaintences. I don't support places that are managed terribly but then I got the phone call...from the owner. WOW. The reason why that place always looks filthy, or have mentally unstable bartenders and management in training mangers who have no idea what the customer experience is further do not care about the image of the business, or how the bathrooms just look like a drug deal was just done or why the place just looks like a sad afterthought is, drum roll please, The Owner Doesn't Care! It all makes sense. After speaking with him and just letting him know what's happening is his business he immediately became unnecessarily defensive. When asked "why I was kicked out" he replied "because I didn't get kicked out quietly". Ok 2 + 2 is like 42 that equation. To be clear I got kicked out for wanting an explanation of why I was being escorted out. Ok fine kick me out for asking questions but explain why I was kicked out to begin with?   NO ONE AT THIS PLACE CAN OR HAS OR WILL EVER BE ABLE TO.   He went on to tell me that because I told the female bartender how I truly felt about her as I was being escorted out again for being a customer, that I was 86'd for life.   "Lol. I don't like Seamus, never have as it one of the worst... (click) "  He hung up on me. Yup.  As a business owner I would think that if someone who NEVER goes to SEAMUS, actually despises Seamus , a non customer who is going out of there way let him/her know the image.of his business that Is going out by these heavily undertrained staff so much so to get the BBB involved, this is probably something to have an open mind about and look into the situation. And be able to answer very simple questions. If you can't tell me why I was asked to leave it is because I was discrimated against for personal reasons and or views of from your so called "bartender". Just man up and say that. Use your head. If she was "offduty" why was she calling the shots when I had been seen and waited on by several of the other bartenders? I saw this girl for 3 min and was asked to leave.   He stated "I have witness's". I have witnesses as well who are regulars there and witnessed the entire display. He didn't care. This is why you establishment sucks.  You suck. (All due respect)

After my experience this evening I will be filing a malpractice lawsuit. This place is horrible, dirty, unsanitary, and unprofessional. They incorrectly diagnosed me, shot me up with blodd thinner, told me i had to stay the night only to tell me hours later that i could go home because they made a mistake.  They took my blood on a dirty table and then alllowed my blood to drip on surfaces by other patients. There is no privacy at all at this circus as i was placed in single patient room in a chair while another patient was in the bed of the room. I heard and saw everyones business. The doctors do not listen to what you are saying they just start signing you up for labs. Stay clear of this place. Stay far away. As i was cursing them out for there bullshit i had other nurses telling me i was right. This place is horrible. Horrible. Horrible.

Worst dentist I have had in my 33 years of life. Seriously. First off the woman working the counter has no idea what she is doing and runs the office like it's a hang out and not a professional place of business. She continued to call me to confirn my "thursday" appointment when i continued to tell her my day off is tuesday. I never had a Thursday appointment. She later lied about requesting my xrays from my last dentist only so they could bill me for more xrays which I didn't need.  Second the so called dentist behaves like a child. My first visit he asked me all these questions and basically flossed my teeth. The next week at my next appointment he asked all the same questions as he did the first time to which i told him several times "we already went over this". He walks around the place telling inappropriate jokes that aren't funny and have no place in this type of environment. I came to have my teeth worked on, not see a show. He went in to clean my teeth and did a horrible job. I felt like I was his first mouth he had ever worked on. He continued to stab my gums painfully  and I continued to speak out. I have had my teeth cleaned too many times to know how it's supposed to go. He continued to get frustrated with me calling him out on his "handy work" and basically told me to "just deal with it".  His staff has no clue what's going on either. The girl who is supposed to be operating the suction hose failed to do so. I had to keep nudging her for suction so I wouldnt drown or swallow that God awful crap they put in my mouth. My shirt was soaked with water from hose dripping down my back. The Dr. Stabbed me one more time and I got up and left. I told the lady at the front desk how unprofessional this place was and that I was going to report them and she said "who are you going to report it to?". What? Unbelievable.   Stay away from this place. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.

Absolute worst customer service and the prices are outrageous. I recently spent $170 dollars on 12 items and had them delivered. They messed up my order, as usual, and the had the audacity to blame me for their poor service. My ten dollar delivery  fee was supposed to be waved and it wasn't. When asked to have it waved I told that they wouldn't because I didn't put a code in. First  off I ordered the five items to keep it free and further spent over 150 dollars which also makes your charge free. This place is terrible. I will never spend my money at another Safeway. Ever.

So tonight was kind of lame. I truly hate when during a legit rotation peeps who know the dj get to sing three songs within 12 minutes while other customers have to wait an hour between songs. This makes the loyals not so loyal.

If I could give this company no stars I would. APS has no idea what customer service is or how to take care of its loyal customers. After being on hold for more 30 min and getting no help I was put on hold for another 20 min to have to call back on Monday because the department I needed to speak to closed while I was holding an hour. I truly believe that its an injustice that I can only get my power from them. Something needs to be done. This company uses it monopoly status to bully its customers.   This company is horrible.

No beuno. Order the chicken sandwich with the new Ghost fries and lets just say not a good experience. The customer service is decent but the food presentation and quality lacks. The fries in the picture are not what I got and the burger tasted as if it had been setting out.

First and foremost I have hesitated going into this place due to the over priced food on the menu and the stand offish attitudes from the staff.   After finally giving them a try I was greated with their not so customer friendly service. Two girls who looked like I was bothering them.   After finally getting my order in, it took them what seemed like 20 min to make an extra small overpriced burrito.  When I ate this thing I almost vomited. It seriously made me nautious. I will not be going back to this establishment. Do not believe the hype people. The price you pay for the garbage they serve is outrageous.   No thank you.

Best part of the Duce is  the Karaoke host Luis! Was there last night and the crowd went wild when Luis did what he does best, host Karaoke. Great night, good crowd, good times.

Where are the owners? When was the last time you have been in your restaurant? You are failing big time and here's why...  This is the 5th time I have reluctantly been to your establishment due to my love of pho however it will be my last. First off when you arrive to the parking lot there is trash and broken down heaters piled up for all to see. This is your first impression to rice paper...trash. You walk in and there is a leaking ac unit in the entrance where water is standing which speaks to another issue I will mention shortly. You walk in and your not greeted you are ignored by an obviously  untrained wait staff who appear to have better shit to deal with then customers who pay their salaries. We sat at the bar while the bartender talked endlessly to her friends and texted. Looking around the dining room you see junk everywhere. You have things on shelves that have no purpose nor appear to have been used or cleaned in years. The place is just dirty. You have wait staff bussing to the bar right were we are sitting. Putting dirty dishes next to where I'm eating is gross and unprofessional. Also get rid of the televisions if your not going to have something worth looking at on. It would be cute if you had romantic movies playing or something of that regard. Infomercials or sports is not the way to go if you considering your self fine dining. Further if you are going to be this run down and not care then lower your prices so that we are paying for what we're getting. I have experienced bugs at your location twice. A small roach walked out on the counter once while I was eating. Absolutely disgusting. This place needs an overhaul.   If your the owner I challenge you to eat at your restaurant and consider this feedback. Clean it up and start caring about the customer experience. There is no sense of urgency to the customer experiance. I asked for my pho to be hot, super hot as it is always Luke warm. Sure enough it came out Luke warm which makes me think that you guys just have soup stock sitting to which you add ingredients into.   Take the message not the tone. Clean it up. Train your staff.

So I would like to first start this review off by saying that the food and the wait staff and even the manager who i had to speak to, not by my request, are very pleasant and worth coming back to. The only issue I had at this location was with the hostess who i had an unfortunate incident with. First they dont take reservations which is fine, i get it, second they have no way of letting people who check in for a table know that their table is ready which is not of this age. We arrive and are told that our wait is 25 min which again is fine. We literally step inside the restaurant next door and come back in 7 min to find that our name was called and our table was taken..which is weird because they made no effort to find us. I then asked the hostess, a young girl, how long are wait was going to be and she literally said "i dont know" . My next words to her were "as a hostess you should typically know how long the wait is". Fast forward to her telling me she didnt like my tone to her going to get her manager and then the manager asking me why his hostess was crying in the back about a disgruntled customer.   i was not disgruntle and it is the hostess responsibility aka job to know this information. The manager i could tell agreed with me as he simply got us sat down in the next 5 min with no further issue and again the food, the waiter were great.   if your going to have a hostess please make sure she is emotionally stable and can handle her job.

First off I go here all the time, this will be my last. The girl in the front taking orders is a total sweetheart. Love her. She has always be so nice, attentive and sweet. However I went there tonight and requested my burger without cheese, which I always do, and the cook put cheese on it. The young lady wanted to make me a new one even make me one to go but I told her it was fine because it wasn't her fault. As I walked away with the burger the incompetent, arrogant, cook was told by her that I didn't want cheese and I hear him say "he'll be fine" very rudely. After I finished half my burger, didn't even care to finish the fries I left and told the cook that next time he might want to wait before the customer is gone before making such rude comments especially when he was completely in the wrong. Next time i'll hit up Five Guys. Lame. Broke this habit.

This is what downtown has been missing. A quaint, reasonably priced, good energy place that is all inviting.   This place is just plain good. Great food, great service, great atmosphere, great time!   And they have tabasco sauce!! So many breakfast places now don't have tabasco sauce. The young girl who served me said "thats all we have...".   I'm hooked. I'll be bringing people to eat here.   Impressive joint.

Absolutely the worst service. Waited 20 min to be acknowledged. This was after moving into the restaurant from the bar where we sat for 15 min. Was finally greeted at the sushi bar only to have our server give us used sushi menu and then dissapeared for another 5 min.   The place was not busy. At all. We kindly left. Went to Hannys.

Absolutely love the tacos. I had the lamb and a shrimp taco using lettuce as the shell. Out of this world. I had a cup of pasole on the side...changed my life. And then to wash it down with two socializers. Amazing. I had heard bad reviews about this spot until i tried it. No clue what people are talking about. This place is awesome.  The server was on point totally made sure we were taken care of. My only critique was noise in the restaurant. We went on a Sunday night which i think is a dj night. It was way too loud to be inside let alone be able to enjoy their food and the music wasnt fitting the chill vibe of the building. We sat on patio and had a great time. I will definitely return.

This place defines customer service. Wow wow wow. First off let me just say that this is my second yelp review about this place and rightly so. Not only am I a true repeat customer as I have been in numerous times after my first visit i feel like I'm now a friend of of the establishment as I know some of the amazing people that work there. One person in particular continues to stand out as AMAZING in everything he does. That is the general manager Justin. When I first met him I thought I was speaking to the owner as he has love and respect for what he does that is out of this world. This man bleeds tequila to say the least. His knowledge of the product is out standing. I have learned so much from him about not only the different kinds of tequila but the history of tequila in general. I used to come for the amazing tacos, great atmosphere, and good vibes, but now I come for the knowledge and history as well. This is all thanks to the GM Justin. Its incredible what he does for this place. Truly incredible. Taco Guild has a customer for life in me. If you haven't been GO. You will not be disappointed. If you don't know Tequila and want to learn about it, have a seat at the bar and allow Justin to paint a picture for you.   Justin thank you for the hospitality. If you ever open your own place, not only would be amazing but you would have me and my friends as regulars!  Kelvin

Well fed and slightly buzzed...  I have given this place three times to disappoint me and they have failed, miserably, all three times. This place just rocks. I have had the seafood pot which was out of this world, the chicken pot which killed it with the jelly, and tonight I found my signature dish and cocktail the kimchi rice bowl with chicken and shrimp with the "word is bond" martini...kicked my ass in flavor, portion, and buzz potential. All thanks to Alexandria with the on point recommendations. This place is a great date night or a cool spot to come chill with that special someone.  You simply must go and go again. #newloyalcustomer
