Love this place good food and if you do paleo you don't have to get the rice  or the macaroni salad just meat and cabbage.

Awesome place ,just not in the summer ,when you have to wait outside due to no room in the waiting area ,not even mist system for out side or free water being offered when u have to wait ,but besides all that good food .

Walked in and there were three employees standing there.  NOT one greeted us and after standing there the employee went and greeted the party that came in after us......not the first time this has happened....get it together!  Customer service is what keeps the customers coming back.

Tried this place when it first opened in surprise not impress didn't come back ,then my boss told me to give it another chance it changed it been like 2 yrs give or take ,so we went back had good service went back again on a Sunday not busy took 30 min to meet the waitress to get drinks , waitress didn't even get told by the host staff we where hers. just very upset about this place they play it like it's the best thing on TV and it's suck at customer service now don't get me wrong once the waitress knew we where there she was on top of it she did a awesome job with what she could do between taking care of her customers and clean the tables she had cause they don't have bust boy/girls o well .that rant about the place .

Good food but man takes forever to get a order in by phone how does a pizza place only have one line come on man more lines means more business. I like the thin crust pizza with meatballs and wings are good too as well as the anti pasta salad is good also. Only reason for the two stars is they need more lines for phone orders.
