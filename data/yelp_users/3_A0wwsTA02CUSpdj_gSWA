The owner John is crazy!!!  I stopped there to meet him for a business appointment.  The entire site is under construction and by the look of it they were closed during this time.    Because of this I parked under the canopy in the shade.  Well, it turns out they aren't closed.  As I walked up to introduce myself to John the first words out of his mouth were "get the fuck out of here"!  He started yelling at me for parking next to one of the gas pumps.  I apologized and told him that I didn't realize that he was open.  He continued to yell "get the fuck out of here"  and added that he would "kick my fucking ass"!  Simply asking me to move my car so I didn't block entering customers would have done the trick.  I happen to live about a mile away and I will never buy a drop of gas from him.  Screw this place and screw John!

Easily the best Mexican food in Phoenix. There literally isn't a bad item on the menu!
