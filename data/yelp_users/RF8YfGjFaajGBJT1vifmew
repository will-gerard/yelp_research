Less than par...  the course layout and design is nice however the fairway and greens were in rough shape - which is somewhat expected this time of year for a 3 star course.  What made the experience unsatisfactory were certain staff at the course.  I don't think I'll be going back.  It's unfortunate since it's so close to home.  Oh well...  Arizona has plenty of other courses.

Always great food and service!   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Chicago style chow.  The only downside of my visits here are the never ending wait list to be seated and the limited beer selection.  The wait can be avoided if you belly-up to the bar area when a seat opens.  However, the beer selection... it is what it is.  There are plenty of other places nearby if you're looking for a good brew.

Great food, great service - unique and authentic.  The naan bread is awesome.  Will definitely be back for more!
