I have been going to this restaurant for about 18 years just so i can get my pesto ranch fix. A few things that will never change..this is a burn and turn establishment.  You will be eating your salad when the main meal comes out. We are not paying for a four course meal.  The atmosphere is kitchy and its fun!   The location in Seattle is my favorite but now living in Phoenix, I make the trip to get downtown. I finally convinced my boyfriend to take the trip last sunday and he was very impressed with quality and price. So much that when we woke up this morning he said he wanted to go there again for lunch today. We usually make our way straight to the lounge so we do not have to wait to get seated and so we can watch sports on tv while enjoying our meal.   We had the same server last week who is very quiet but prompt.  Do not expect the best service, as a past server, smaller checks (food is cheap) means smaller tips and servers are not as frantic to help you out.    As far as the menu, get the cheesy garlic bead, get the ranch!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is mixed with pesto.  I will sometimes ask for a to-go container just so I can have some at home. JESUS DEAR LORD it is amazing.  All of the pasta dishes taste about the same but make sure that you get brown butter Mazitha pasta.  After having this years ago, i make this at home but it is still never as good.    I will always come back to this place.  I love it.

This place is AWESOME. It is very similar to Houston's and I am totally fine with that since the closest Houston's is in Old Town.   This is a usual Friday night date spot for me and my boo. Usually has a wait but we get lucky every time to find a seat at the bar to order a pre dinner cocktail. The lemon drops are tasty, the BF gets gin and tonics normally. He wishes they had a little more selection of gin..but no big deal.   We like to go for the date night special where we can sample an app, salads, and a main meal for about $30 bucks a piece. We are not strict on how much we spend on meals so it just depends on what the main entrees there are offering at that time.  My typical eating style is big eyes, smaller stomach. I order way too much food but luckily, my man usually eats any left overs the next day.   I am a big fan of the the artichoke dip with the salsa as an appetizer and I usually go straight for the ribs. They are damn good! I have also had a steak that is marinated in balsamic vinegar. The steak looked funky when they brought it out, I didn't say anything and they said they were already making me another steak to take home. OK! Steak and eggs for breakfast.   Go to this place. You will make it one of your weekly destinations.

Not overly impressed with this place. It seems to be un organized compared to chain bagel shops I like to go to. I ordered a sesame bagel with plain cream cheese. Took about 5 minutes to get and the place was not busy.  Was excited to get an ice coffee but all of the coffee was out besides decaf and a dark blend. I have heard good things about their burrito but I doubt I will ever go back to try it.  I try to be positive about my reveiws but just not feeling this place.

I live in the desert ridge area so this is a fast beautiful drive that takes about 15 minutes. We arrived on a Saturday and there was a little farmers marker in the parking lot. We arrived right when they opened and were excited for our boozy lunch!   Right when we walked up the manager, he had the door opened and ready to great us. The tables are very close to each other so we opted for the empty bar counter. I liked this too because you can spy into the kitchen. We were instantly greeted by the bar tender and let the momos (mimosas) flow! They have a nice champagne and fresh squeeze the OJ right there! Talk about fresh!   We got the menu and knew we had to order the fries. Get the small, its good for more than two. I love love love you french fries..absolutely the fing best! I liked the sauces. It took a few trys to like the truffle mayo.   More momos!   My buddy told me that I had to try the french onion when I got there. That happened and it was beautiful and full of beefy flavor with a nice strong cheese. My bf got a side Caesar that had pieces of anchovy in the dressing. It looked good but I was to focused trying to get the cheese off of my chin ;)   I opted to get my third mimosa and the bf tried a nice gin that he has been clamoring for. The bar tender was really knowledgeable about all of the booze which made for good conversation as well. At this point you can see we like our cocktails!   For lunch I ordered the grilled cheese. Very tasty but iI was so full at that point that I did not get down and dirty with it. Most of it went home. Bf ordered the trout and I have to say..how outstanding. It had a browned buttered taste with toasted almonds. My god!   We spent 160 on lunch...just saying its not cheap but if you don't drink like a fish you will still pay 60 to 70 for lunch.   I will be back for a nice evening on the patio soon! It looks beautiful out there, like a little french cafe.

I LOVE YOU HUMBLE PIE!!! I order this to go about once per week. I call before I leave the office and it is ready to go in 10 minutes. It's tastier and faster than any delivery pizza you can get...unless you are hung over on a Sunday and cant bare to drive to pick it up. ;)   I just tried the wings last week and will get the extra spicy next time but even once i brought them home they were still crispy and tender. noms!   Pepperoni pizza, I love you. Small gourmet little slices of meat love. My bf gets the clam pizza...never had a bite but he loves it! I just cant seem to get away from what a normal pizza should be.   The crust of the pizza is killer, chewy and fluffy. Amazing wood fired taste to it as well.   This place is always packed during dinner hours but dies down around 8pm or so. Looks like a really fun place to go for mingling in the busy hours. After 9-10 hours of work, I am done talking to people and prefer pizza time with cats and bf.

Yum! This is one of my favorite "gourmet burgers" in the valley. This is right by work so I like to go here for lunch a couples times a month.   The interior of the place is super hip and retro. You used to order at the counter but they changed it sit down with a waitress. I honestly prefer this better since I feel like the servers actually make some money now. There are plenty of booths and an awesome patio to choose from and the lunch time crowd is not too large so you will get a seat right away.   They have a lunch time special which comes out to be around 11 bucks. All of the burgers are tasty and you get your cheese selection. White cheddar is noms but I also like American cheese. When I recently went, I tried the Philly Burger. Provolone cheese and giardiniera (which was nice an oily and good spice) I think the burger needs some sort of sauce.   YOU HAVE TO GET THE ONION RINGS! Get there chipotle, infusion sauce. OMG! Some of the best onion rings I have had.   To go: I would not recommend getting anything to go. The burgers get to soggy.
