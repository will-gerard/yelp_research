So here is the deal. I walked in and out last week. The menu was way too confusing. I decided to try it again today was happy to see that they simplified the menu. I ordered a plate with chicken and tasted pretty much every side they offered me. The jasmine rice was horrible. The portion size was impressive but I felt like Gordon Ramsay throwing out an entire plate of food but I did. Good concept but inedible food.  The owner has already reached out to me and I plan on trying the place again. I give it a 4 now based on the staff. Very professional. Let's see if the food can raise my overall score to a 5.

Owner was very nice. Drinks were good. Music was terrible and most of the food was average at best.
