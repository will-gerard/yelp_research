I have noticed most Goodwills seem ton"specialize" in certain items. This particular store seems to regularly have good options in the clothing and big furniture areas. I have bought many nice dress shirts from this store, and they are often much nicer here than you get at other Goodwills. And they always have plenty of desks, shelves, and couches.  The store is well lit and relatively spacious. You will occasionally get blocked from an aisle because of an elderly person or someone with an overloaded cart.  Beware the 50% off Saturdays which happen every other week. These can be great times to find great deals, but the crowds can be really annoying. Check out times will slow to a crawl because people are buying lots of stuff. My advice for this is to go during the week and see if there is anything you want. Then go first thing when they open (9am) and pick it up right away. That way you don't waste time fighting crowds just to find there wasn't anything you wanted anyway.  I live near this Goodwill so I pop in regularly, which you will need to do to find the best deals. I always manage to find something worth buying.

I have been to Liberty Market on several different occasions now and it is definitely a place you need to visit if you are in the East Valley.   The location is excellent, on a street corner in downtown Gilbert directly across from Postino's and Joyride. Built out of an actual Market, there are still vintage shopping carts and other items adorning the decor. The size, feel, and layout make it nice for couples, families, or other large groups. Outdoor seating is nice but limited, and you may find yourself in the sun depending on where you sit.  The counter ordering process is novel, but more and more places are adopting this method. Often the lines can be long, especially for some dinners and Sunday brunch, but there are usually plenty of staff to keep the process moving. Even at it's longest I don't think I've waited more than 20 minutes or so to order and sit down. Plus the time passes pretty quickly because the line runs next to the open kitchen, allowing you to look at all the prep work going on and to admire the wood-fired pizza oven.  As for food, I have yet to be disappointed by my selections. I have mostly gone to Liberty Market for brunch. The seasonal pancake is always a nice option, with the most recent one being an orange pancake with a vanilla drizzle. It was light and not overly sweet, just good hints of orange with only as much vanilla syrup as you need (even though you might want more). I personally think the best  selection on the breakfast/brunch menu is the Smothered Breakfast Burrito. They have a grilled chicken or Schreiner's chorizo option for the protein and both are good (although I usually opt for the chorizo). Tomatillo or chile pequin salsas on top, yum yum! It's definitely a large item, so plan on being full or sharing with your dining companions. You can also order single glasses or large carafes of mimosas or sangria. Both are good ways to start a relaxing weekend.  On top of all of this they also have a very nice coffee bar that can be accessed separately from the food if you are just stopping in for your caffeine fix. The regular coffee is certainly good, but if you really want a good coffee experience go for the Cafe Au Lait or the "Ca Phe" which is a take on Vietnamese iced coffee.   Downtown Gilbert is amassing a very nice selection of dining establishments, especially with the Upward Projects restaurants anchoring the scene. But for my money, I almost always find myself at Liberty Market when I'm in the area.

It should be no surprise that Four Peaks is getting a stellar rating from me. This is a staple in the brewery/restaurant scene for Phoenix.   The Girl and I were meeting up with a friend. He wasn't going to be ready for awhile, but we were hungry! So we headed out a little early. It's a good thing we did, because there was a wait. It was actually one of the less busy Friday nights I've seen, but a wait is typical on a busy night. The wait is made significantly better by the fact that you can go in and get your drinking started by ordering from the bar. There's one little spot where people waiting usually order, which can be annoying because it gets backed up. But there are plenty of bartenders to get everyone served, and the TVs all around help pass the time too. After a little while (maybe 20 minutes, maybe a little more. I lost track) we got seated outside. We sat outside on the patio, which is always my preference. When the weather is nice it can't be beat. Plus the inside gets a little loud for my tastes.  The Girl ordered Kilt Lifter. I went for a specialty beer they brewed up: a white IPA. It was excellent. I like beer in all it's many forms, but The Girl does NOT do IPA's. She took a sip and didn't even wince. The simplest way to describe it (and this doesn't even come close to doing it justice, but I'm trying to keep this review to a manageable length) is to imagine if your favorite Hefe and your favorite, medium-hopped IPA had a sweet, tangy, and citrusy little baby. I stuck with the white IPA for the whole night.  We were waiting on my friend, so we ordered the Arizona Chicken Rolls to start. This really is a requirement when you come to Four Peaks. The menu is great overall, but the Chicken Rolls are hands down my favorite item on the menu. The "sweet jalape√±o dressing" is perfect - a nice blend of sweet and spicy. I always order an extra serving of the dressing because I use so much of it. It's $8 for two rolls, and I'll sometimes make a meal of just this alone. Okay, I'll stop gushing now...  We waited as long as we could, but ordered just before our friend got there. The Girl ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich ($12.5) with fries. She also had them put the onion straws and bleu cheese on the side. I was not feeling the typical sandwich and fries pub food that night, but Four Peaks did not let me down. On their special nightly menu (a few extra special dishes that are one night only), they had a perfect meal: a cherry wood smoked ribeye topped with poached eggs, served with cajun cream cheese mashed potatoes and grilled squash. The Girl enjoyed her sandwich, although she was very glad she ordered the onion straws and cheese on the side - there was a lot of it! There was a lot of bread (which is typical) so she didn't eat all of it. My ribeye was outstanding. Ordered it medium rare (like you're supposed to) and it came out perfect. Melt in your mouth excellence, and there was lots of smokiness to it which I really enjoyed. The mashed potatoes had just enough kick to make them feel special. I was a bit underwhelmed with the grilled squash, mostly because  the slices lacked any seasoning that I could taste. If you've got a dish with strong spice (from the potatoes) and lots of smokiness (from the steak), then plain-jane grilled veggies ain't gonna be quite enough. Just a little bit of salt and pepper helped a lot. I was definitely full and satisfied by the end of the meal.  Eventually our friend did come and we had an enjoyable evening. The waitress was attentive and nice. She was very patient and still attentive despite the fact that we sat for quite a while waiting on our friend.    If you are at all interested in craft and local beers, then this place sets the standard for Arizona, in my opinion. There are lots of really great places popping up, but it's inevitable to find myself at another brew pub saying, "Well, it's not as good as Four Peaks" about something. Not everything, but  something. Four Peaks gets high marks in every aspect of the experience: atmosphere, wait staff, beer quality, food quality, and price point. If you haven't been to Four Peaks, you are missing out on a quintessential Phoenix spot. Go now!

Tonight we (the girl and I) decided to bike around downtown checking out all the chic neighborhoods and dream of where we would live if we could. And we decided to end the night with dinner at Tuck Shop, which proved to be a good choice (as usual).  The ambience is great. The low, wood-paneled ceiling creates a very cozy feel. And the waiting area looks like a living room so you really feel your just going over to a good friend's house for dinner. My only (minor complaint) about the "over at a friend's house" atmosphere is the TV behind the bar.  You can't get away with having a bar AND no TV in this town (I understand), but I can still have a small complaint about it.  We started out sharing the cheese curds and the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. The cheese curds were very tasty, although I wouldn't mind a side of spicy mustard or something. Perhaps red pepper jam? The dates were excellent. A perfect mix of spice and sweet, topped with Gruyere cheese.   I also added a brisket street taco on an impulse, and I'm glad I did. The brisket is cooked perfectly (which they do next door at their other eatery, Astor House). It came with a lime-cilantro-avocado sauce which was good, but I felt the sauce covered up the flavor of the amazing brisket.  Our main course (which was shared, as most plates are and should be at Tuck Shop) was the "Vovo's Favorite"- the special of the night-a half duck in a oyster and mushroom au jus, served with a sweet potato cake and grilled grapes. I felt like I was having Thanksgiving dinner all over again. The sweet potato cake was nice and light, and the grapes worked much better than I had expected. The flavor of the duck was excellent. The only problem with the dish was that the duck was a bit dry and tough. I usually expect a much juicier and fatty piece of duck, so I was a little underwhelmed with the texture. Overall I was pleased, and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on the duck.  Our server was pleasant and helpful, making sure our wine glasses stayed full. It's hard to beat the overall experience at Tuck Shop. Despite a few minor flaws with the food, I will keep coming back again...and again...and again.

I did not give a review of Perch last time I was there because they had only been open for about a week. I am always willing to give a place (especially a new one) the benefit of the doubt. But with this being the second time and almost two months later, I have to render a verdict.  Let me say I really (REALLY ) want to like this place. The location is great. The beer selection is very good, and the wine selection is interesting, although not overly extensive. And the food is also good. They have some kinks to work out in the finer points of some dishes, but overall the place lives up to its "gastropub" distinction. I would be inclined to give the food and drink menus a four star rating. But what is the one thing that makes the best food and drink taste bad?....the service. Service should get half a star at best.   When I first sat down at the bar, it took almost five minutes before one of the two main bartenders acknowledged my presence, even though I was sitting right next to the service bar. The first beer came relatively quickly, but the woman next to me that sat down (and also owns a local restaurant) had to wait almost ten minutes just to get a glass of wine.  Apparently at this establishment it takes two  bartenders to deal with a half-full bar and a half-full restaurant. This was a Sunday afternoon, so we weren't dealing with the Friday/Saturday night rush. Two separate times I waited ten minutes before a bartender noticed my beer was gone. I wasn't just waiting to be noticed though... I tried to flag down a bartender three separate times and they looked right past me! I did manage to order some food (the poutine style tater tots) which was very good. But no one checked how I liked the food or asked if I wanted to order more food, even though I explicitly said I would order more later.   These bartenders had to keep checking recipes to make margaritas. I mean, I know what it's like to be a new bartender, but come on! I'm not sure how these guys got hired to be bartenders but it wasn't for their speed or ability to mix cocktails - most of which went out without garnishes (remember, I was sitting next to the service bar).  Here's a few other things I jotted down in the moment: 1) One bartender left his sinus rinse bottle out on the bar. I understand it sucks when you are dealing with allergies, but that doesn't look great to the guests. 2) The only bartender that knew anything about service and making drinks only showed up every once in a while (busy elsewhere I assume). 3) I watched a bartender spill Knob Creek on his hand and all over the floor because he was haphazardly holding two glasses rather than setting them on the bar mats which were right in front if him.  If I could make one recommendation to this place it would be to focus on service for the foreseeable future. And teach your bartenders how to actually tend bar - make drinks and help customers in a timely fashion. As I said already, I want this place to be great and hope to come back in the future, but as it stands the food and drink offerings do not make up for the terrible service (at the bar at least).  One nice point was the guitarist playing in the courtyard. He played a nice selection of tunes and could be heard throughout the restaurant.
