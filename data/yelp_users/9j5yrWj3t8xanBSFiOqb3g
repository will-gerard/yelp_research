I've been seeing Dr. Nia as my dentist for over 10 years. His chair side manners are wonderful. He's so kind, gentle and he makes you feel comfortable. I know the dental chair is no ones favorite place to be but Dr. Nia does amazing dental work and I would trust him with not only myself but my family too. I've also seen Dr. Wruble who is equally great. It's nice to have a choice if you'd like a female dentist or a male dentist. Shelly, Karen and Megan are great dental hygienists. Nothing feels better than having freshly cleaned teeth!

Even though I've worked in the dental field for over 13 years I still get nerve as a patient. I needed a tooth extracted along with bone grafting and an implant. Dr. Austin made me feel so comfortable and explained everything that would be done during my surgery. He did a 3D scan and found that I had severe bone loss and an infection so I would need to do my surgery in two phases. I'm very happy that he was able to see this issue with the advanced technology that was conveniently available right in the office. I already had my surgery for the first phase and everything went great. I'm scheduled to have the second phase done in a couple weeks and I'm actually looking forward to it! Thank Dr. Austin for your excellent work and being so thorough!!

I had no other choice but to go to urgent care yesterday when my primary care dr couldn't get me in for a double ear infection, fever and sore throat. I've never been so impressed by an urgent care. They have a great call back system so you don't have to wait there, they call you when the dr is ready to see you. I was seen quickly and the staff was very nice, knowledgable and thorough. I've been battling ear infections for awhile and Dr. Meyer could tell when she did my exam. She put me on medication that has me feeling so much better already. She advised me to see my ENT dr so I could prevent these reoccurring ear infections. I hope I don't have a need to be seen at urgent care again but if I do, I would definitely go back to Dignity Urgent Care. Thank you so much!!

I just gave birth to my first child a month ago. I can't say enough good things about my experience with labor and delivery. My first nurse Erin was great! I was so full of emotions going through this for the first time...happy, nervous yet exhausted. Erin made me feel like a friend and not just a patient. She really helped me through the epidural process which was one of the scariest parts for me. I was having stronger contractions at that time so it was hard to stay still but she helped me through it. The anesthesiologist did an amazing job...no pain and I was in heaven after that! My labor went into shift change and Susan was now my nurse. Wow I can't say I've ever had a better nurse! She checked on me every 10-15 mins or it felt that way. She was so attentive and always made sure I was doing okay. When it came time to deliver she was amazing!! She was my biggest cheerleader. She was just so encouraging and made it such wonderful experience. I'll never forget her and I can only hope she will be my nurse next time I have a baby! Thank you Susan!!!  **See update from dealing with their billing department!! Nightmare!!!

I have to say I've had great experiences with the hospital itself but the billing is absolutely horrible!! I received my bill for giving birth to my daughter and sent in my payment. They applied the payment to the wrong account! I've called them for 5 months to get it corrected. They have yet to do it and they're now trying to send me to collections! I've talked to Cedric I don't know how many times (he's very nice but doesn't have the authority to fix the mistake). He always tells me he has told his supervisor and will have it fixed. I even spoke to a supervisor and was promised it would be corrected. Just received another bill! Sent it back with a letter. I know I won't be going there to have my next baby!! Too bad, I loved that part of it.

My husband and I order food to go a lot from Blue 32. Whenever I've gone in to get our food, everyone is very friendly and always checks to make sure I've been helped. They are very courteous on the phone even when they are extremely busy. We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and had a great experience each time. Great service and great food! Thanks guys!!

This is my husband and I's favorite restaurant. We go to this Kona almost every week. We've only experienced nothing but good things. There was only one time when one of my sushi rolls came out pretty pathetic but our server was right on it and sent it back to have it remade.  The manager comped our drinks for us. We returned again the other night and the same manager gave us a complimentary dessert. We've gone to the Kona in Chandler and I can't say the same for the service there but the San Tan location is one of the best!! We've become regulars and will continue to be with such great service and staff!

We moved to the area a little less than a year ago and love sushi so we found this place. It's literally right down the street from us. We've only done takeout and had a great experience at first. Lately when we've called they else don't answer and we get a voicemail, tell us it's over a two hr wait or completely refuse to even take our order if it's takeout. There is one guy there that is very nice and apologetic when he can't except a takeout order but we've had someone else that has been rude about it. I understand places get busy, I've worked as a waitress before but don't take your frustrations out on a customer. I don't understand refusing takeout orders either?? I guess we'll just have to drive further to get good service. It's too bad because they do actually have good sushi and we like to support local businesses but they don't seem to care to have ours.

I've had nothing but great experiences from this location. We order takeout at least once a week. Awhile back I was running errands and ordered takeout on my way home. My daughter was with me and fell asleep. Not wanting to wake her up to go in to pick up the food and definitely not wanting to leave her in the car I asked if they do curbside. The man on the phone (I really wish I asked for your name) said they don't normally do curbside service but he would definitely accommodate us and do curbside for us. I was so grateful and impressed by his compassion. Not only do we like the food here but everyone is so nice and they give such great customer service. Thank you to the manager who made my life easier that day and brought our food out to the curb for us! Austin is always so awesome and upbeat when I call to place our order. Thank you guys for such great customer service...all the time!

A group I'm in always shares current deals on a wide arrange of items. My daughter's 2nd birthday is coming up and I was looking for a Little Tike bounce house. So I was really excited to see Target had them marked down to $59.98 from $199.99. Our local Target did not have them marked down so I called to see if they would price match the other surrounding stores that did have them marked down. I was told by Steve the store team lead that they don't price match clearance items. That Superstore prices are different than regular Target stores. Once I told him other Superstore Targets had it listed for the lower price he then backtracked to say it's actually individual store pricing. So I would have to drive to another Target store over an hour away if I wanted that price instead of driving 3 miles to the Target I literally shop at everyday. People in the group that posted this deal had no problems getting their prices matched by their local Target. So I checked the next nearest Target that showed availability and even though their price was also $199.99 they price matched the $59.98 and gave me $12 in "Target apologize money" for my bad experience with my local Target. You could learn some good customer service from your fellow Target stores Queen Creek Target!

I've always had such a great experience with whoever I get. When I can request someone I normally request Ian but yuh really can't go wrong with anyone there. I recently went there and had Tommy. He did an awesome job on my pedicure and my gel polish manicure. Great prices, customer service and quality of work. I'll never go anywhere else!

My wedding took place a few years ago but I've recently pulled out my photos to look for some pictures of my dad from that special day. Not only did I not have any great photos of my dad but looking through them they just look like an amateur took them. I really wish I would have spent the extra money to hire a more professional photographer. My wedding was perfect except dealing with Nancy. She was constantly calling me at work to ask me questions that could have waited. Our engagement session was just awkward, we should have looked for a different photographer then. She was rude to everyone at my wedding including her assistant. He actually took better photos and was really nice.  Now that I really need great photos from that day I'm so disappointed in my selection. Please spend the extra money and find a more professional photographer. You'll regret it if you don't!

My husband and I have dined here a few times now and the first experience was great and the restaurant is beautiful but I wasn't impressed by my meal.  I ordered the sea bass and I have to say I've definitely had better.  But my husband loved it and the service was great so we went again.  This time I ordered the lobster entree and it was to die for...cooked just right and the sauce was amazing!! We recently went there to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and had a wonderful time, the food and drinks were amazing, and our waiter took great care of us knowing it was a special evening. We'll definitely be returning again soon!

We returned here for our 6 year anniversary in November and splurged on a private booth. I was pregnant at the time so we wanted to really enjoy ourselves knowing it'll be one of our last outings for awhile. I was set on getting the lobster entree again...I saved my one seafood a week meal for that night. Unfortunately we found out that they took it off the menu! But our waiter was awesome!! He made sure I got my lobster dinner. He spoke to the manager and they made a pregnant woman happy. It wasn't the same entree but it was a lobster dinner and that was good for me. I really do hope they bring the lobster entree back...it was the best I've ever had!

Dr. Behera holds a special place in my heart for helping me and my husband receive the best gift...our daughter! After trying for over 5 years we sought her help. I loved sitting down with her one on one at our first visit. She takes the time to get to know you personally and your history. She puts together a plan that is best for you. We didn't feel like we were just a number. Just after 2 months we were pregnant! I'll never forget the day we received the call with a positive pregnancy test. Not only is Dr. Behera amazing but so is her staff! We'll be seeing her again soon to help us with baby #2!!!
