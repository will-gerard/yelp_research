Our appetizer and main course came cold. Our server forgot about us for a good 20 minutes while we waited for the check. I've had great service here before but not today.

Just came in here for a quick lunh whole my vehecle got worked on across the street at discount tires. Ordered a grilled chicken taco ,  fish taco and a small order of fries.  Everything was delicious. The cashier was very friendly ,  I've never been full off 8 bucks and my stomach feels fine.

I LOVED this place but i just came here for lunch and i just literally had the WORST experience ever with an unfamiliar waiter,  he had absolutely no motivation while taking our order and he was slow and seemed to be out of it. He took an unnecessarily long time with every interaction with us and we were finally able to place our order nearly 30 minutes after arriving. My friend ordered a salad and when it arrived it took over 10 minutes to get a fork  - I believe they wanted him ti eat it with his fingers.   Unless management finds some new non-drug addict employees I do not think I will be returning.

Tried several different barbers in downtown Phoenix and decided to try Pinkys out. My haircut came out flawless I'm really impressed with the speed and quality that Greg cut my hair with. Cheaper than other barbers in the area. Will be returning.
