Coming from the Silicon Valley and the Bay Area, I was spoiled with so many great Thai restaurants. Wild Thaiger definitely have some delicious food. I had the Kiewan (green curry beef) for lunch. I also ordered Dragon Eggz for appetizers. My group and I didn't have enough time to try any of the desserts, but I am definitely coming back for it and order other dishes as well.

I went back to Wild Thaiger for lunch today. I ordered Chicken  Pad Thai. It was mediocre and the service was bad. Waitress never asked us how the food was or how we are doing. When I asked her for chopsticks, she just walked away. I had to flag her down for our check. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:15 so it wasn't really busy.

One thing I like about China Chili is they are consistent. Food is always delicious, the portions are big, and the service is fast. The first time I found China Chili via Yelp of course, was on my first business trip to Phoenix in June of last year (2015). Who would have thought that I would move to Phoenix almost two months later!! I work and live less than two miles from China Chili so yes, I am a regular patron now. Please continue to make the best Chinese food in Phoenix and remember that good customer service goes a long way.

Excellent customer service and the guy who assisted me with the modem-router was knowledgeable and helpful.

Dr. Edward Paul is one of the best doctors I've ever had. He will call and email until he gets in touch with me for my lab results and any other time he needed to get a hold of me. Good listener, takes his time, whenever I am in his office, and is very thorough. Dr. Paul is easy to get a hold of with any questions or concerns I have. I haven't had any issues thus far with the family practice staff whether front desk or nurses.

First wine bar I visited since I moved to Phoenix and Postino on Central did not disappoint! It was very busy considering we went on a Monday night. Our server recommended the specials which was a bottle of wine (anything on the wine list) and four kinds of brushetta. I ordered the Stagedive 2013 Pinot Noir. Good service and great ambiance. I will definitely come back.

We tried Humble Pie for the first time and we were not disappointed. We had the burger, tempura green beans, calamari, and barbeque pizza. We came around 4pm on a Saturday and was surprised that the appetizers were happy hour prices. Our server, Paul was friendly and attentive. Excellent service! Glad to have purchased the Groupon for Humble Pie.

Pet Market is the best place in Phoenix where they sell nothing but natural, organic, and holistic food for pets. I came in today for the second time at the store. The first time was back in December when I was looking for some Christmas gift for my cat.   One of the staff asked me what kind of food do I give my cat. I told him that he is on a special prescription only food, Royal Canin Urinary ISO for life. My cat has urinary and tract problems. He knew right away what I was talking about. He showed me and educated me about an all natural cat food that they sell specifically for cats with urinary tract issues. He gave me a sample of the food. My cat loved the food and it smells good, too! It doesn't have that funky cat food smell. The only reason I never changed my cat's food was due to his issues and his vet told me that he has to be on the Urinary ISO food for life.   Today, my cat ran out of food so I went back to the store for the second time. The guy who helped me before wasn't there, but a female staff showed me the same product. She was just as helpful and knowledgeable.  Their prices are a bit higher as it is much smaller store compared to Petsmart and other chain stores, but Pet Market sells quality products. You get what you pay for, so they say. I would suggest to the owners though that they should have occasional sales especially for their loyal customers. They have my email and snail mail address so I hope to receive sales and coupons.   Give them a try! Your pet/s will thank you.
