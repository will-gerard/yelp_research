Staff at checkout is unhelpful. I will drive out of my way to another store. Woman up front did not want to even get out of her chair, and spoke with a nasty smirk.

Great local owners, great pizza, yes, greasy, but the hot wing are the hottest I can find. Period. If you want a beer, take it out to Tast of the Tops, two doors down. They welcome it.

They have never been very friendly at least compared to other ace hardware's I normally go to but their convenience sometimes makes it necessary to go to the store however today I tried to buy a 1 gallon spray tank ace brand the label clearly had $9.99 on it but the gal at checkout scannef it and it came up at 1499 she promptly called somebody to take a look at it and when he got there he looked at a small set of numbers on the label and said oh I don't have that one, now there were three facings with that same 999 label. I asked him if he could honor the 999 price since it was mislabeled he said well it might not have been mislabeled somebody like a customer might have moved it said he could honor 11 99.  Outrageous, you would think trying to keep a customer would be a priority, but then to accuse me if switching the tags?

I have been to Cadillac Ranch a dozen or so times in the past year and a half, generally service is slow, and food is a little overpriced for the atmosphere they have (a bull ride) but generally I have had a pleasant time. However, On 26 Jan 2011, I went to CR with two others for drinks and food, it was about 8:30, and there were only about 20 customers in the store, 2 bartenders at main bar, 1 cleaning patio bar and at least 4 waitresses. We had good service, until a group of about 15 customers came in, we got our appetizers, ordered one more beer and did not see our waitress for 20 minutes. I found her at the bar, and said it had been a long time, and could we add another beer, she said she was terribly sorry, she just got sat with 15 ppl, way across the restaurant (the 15top was by the bathroom, we were behind the hostess stand bar side) I said she has been great, but obviously the mgr isn't so great since he does not know how to cut up a floor for service. 1 beer came 5 minutes later, and so did the 'Vietnamese catfish fish and chips' they were undercooked, and went back. a guy came over and said 'got the beers to ya' and 'any other problems?' we said all is fine now. He then said 'i don't appreciate it when my waitresses come up to me and say customers are calling me a tool'. I explained our problem, he kept berating a laboring the subject, including 'where else would i put 15 people' (the place was empty, even after the 15top, there were no more than 40 people in there; 'i have to have people help all customers' and 'in the restaurant industry when it is not busy, i have to cut people' and 'if you would have brought your complaint to me, i could help you' he had no clothing on that indicated he was a manager. He said that he'd almost rather ask us to leave instead of us 'badmouthing' him. He went to kitchen, we decided we would leave, told our waitress to cancel the redo on the fish, and get our bill. The fish comes out, we told the runner that it was canceled, our waitress brings our bill, the fish is on it, we tell her to take it off, she goes to find the mgr, Doug is his name, to take off food. He then storms to the table slaps the bill down and says "pay this then leave". we paid, I asked him for his last name he said "you don't need it" and I asked for the bill he did not reply. This is the WORST experience I have had in a restaurant in a long time. This guy Doug had no right to get up in our faces, period.  We proceeded across the way to San Filipes and brought about 6 more people that were walking up the stairs to go to CR and had a great time.

As a replacement for the Library bar, this place is bad. Poor service rven when it is not busy, however the ladies whom may or not be blonde are typically ASU attractive. Food, on two occasions is bland. Ceasar chicken wrap, the deep fried breading tasted like the oil was old, they just slap some small chunks of chicken on a tortilla, add some tasteless dressing and serve. The hot wings are anything but.

No hostess, waited 3 mins at front, no seat yourself sign. Sat at bar, no bartender for 5 minutes then when arrived, took existing customers food orders, and took a paymet before even looked at me. Then calls me boss. I hate that  Food came, no napkins.  Had to beg for anything other than barnap at bar. Take your business to a local place, Casey moores, pedal haus,
