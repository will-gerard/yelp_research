Has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. Monday and Tuesday when you are there at or after 8-close, It is $20 bucks for a bottle of wine and your choice of four different slices of their bruschetta.   The Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.  You can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.  Be aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip.   Valet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible. But when you expect it, you should not be disappointed.

I dropped my car of for an oil change, had an appointment made two days before. I called four hours later just for them to say they hadn't even started it yet and it would be another 2 hours. Over 2 hours later I finally got a call saying the car was ready. Needless to say I will not be going back to this dealership any time soon.

Extremely disappointed in this place. The one in Scottsdale is great. This location however not so much.   Got a pan pizza and literally came out as bread and cheese. There was almost NO sauce on it and hardly any ingredients. It was cut into 4 giant slices, then everything fell off as I picked it up with a spatula! Not only that but on too of this, the pizza dough wasn't even cooked through all the way. Such a waste of money.

Awful place... First off the wait took forever to get seated around 3pm on a Thursday. The hostess seemed unsimpathetic to our concerns. But we decided to continue on, the margaritas we had were way to heavy with the sweet and sour. The food came out 35 minutes after we ordered, again for the time it should not have been busy. The server didn't even apologize and as well didn't being the additional hot sauce I requested. In short, this place really isn't worth your time.
