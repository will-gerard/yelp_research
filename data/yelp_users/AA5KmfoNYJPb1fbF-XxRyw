Love this place.  The hot sauce complemts every item. Kids like the constant dim sum action.

Perhaps it was the busiest day of the year but the service was horrible. 12 minutes before anyone even came to our table and beverages were always empty.   The sushi was just okay. Feels like due to thanksgiving, shipping fresh fish was backed up. The salmon was mushy and the flavor was light.

The worst service in all of Chandler.i have been here a dozen times and it never improves. Takes 10 minutes to get a menu and silverware. Another 10 minutes to place an order and then 30 minute to make an egg. I am a person who enjoys supporting non-big chain local small business but not at the sacrafice of poor service. The village in is only 2 miles west of the hanger cafe on queen creek.

No Wi-Fi which at this point is a must have for those of us meeting customers out for breakfast.  The greeting staff was rude and won't seat you until your entire party arrives. The food is good but giving two stars in that service carries a heavier weight for me over Breakfast food quality.

The worst hotel on the strip unless you enjoy poor service, an extremely slow check Ballys gaming company, who operates the hotel.. It took 48 minutes to check in.   I would stay at an MGM or WYNN property before ever staying here.   I have a laundry list of issues from starting up the iron to iron my clothes and it not working. 45 minutes later getting a replacement to getting water from the hall way vending machine for $3.00 and it not dispensing water. I called the front desk and they state, sorry, we can't help you.   Worst hotel on the strip bar none.

We like to frequent and support locally owned business's but wow, these guys can't seem to get the operation side of things down after all these years..Always short staffed with servers which causes long wait times and poor service. The food is great but the service is to be desired.

Happy hour prices are fantastic and the sushi is good but not great. The service my last two visits was poor. It's the subtle things they dont do like introducing yourself when waiting a table. Perhaps a smile or hi my name is. Nothing.  Very stale with an attitude like I don't want to be here.. 2 stars just because the sushi is good.

Great Man environment to get your hair cut. LCD tvs at every station with ESPN playing and friendly, experienced barbers.

Awesome! If you are going for lunch, get there before noon or you'll have to wait in line.. Get the P10 and hot if you want to clear your sinus's. It's delicious..

No wi-fi and the manager doesn't know the password to access it. If you need a spot with wireless Internet, this is not the place.

Very good sushi but very poor service. Was seated an it took 11 minutes for a server to ask for a drink order and the floor in our booth has remains from prior diners such a shrimp tails an used chop sticks.

If I could no stars I would. We Wanted to try out the new local Zipps but were sadly disappointed. We were seated quickly and just sat there for 16 minutes without a single server to even take stop by with a simple "I'll be right with you". The table next to us had been could tell of our frustration and the gentlemen said they ordered burgers 45 minutes ago and still hadn't received them..

Best fresh oysters east of the 101.. Plenty of selection and served with all the right toppings.. The lobster Mac and cheese is close to Oceans Club quality, less the price tag. The King is good but the sauce is a bit bland. The cioppino is stellar. Friendly staff. We sit at the bar by the steam pots to watch the dish being made.
