Food is always good and fast!  I've never actually eaten in we always order to go. It has become my go to place for Chinese

Food was okay at best. Portions were very small. Probably some of the worst service. Very disappointing! Hopefully downtown can get some better breakfast options.

Great place for an afternoon lunch on the patio!  They had the misters going and umbrellas up.  The drink menu had a lot of local brews on it as well.  Portions of food were great!  Service was great as well!  We'll be back again soon!

Crossfit Fury is an incredible establishment! They take the time and energy to care about each person. They push and encourage to no end. It is more than just a place to workout. It has changed my whole out look!

Was looking for a new barber as mine sometimes has been inconsistent. Great service. Clean lines etc. I will definitely be back!

Don't understand the negative reviews. Awesome food, great wine list, great atmosphere.   We went with a group of 8. The chicken was excellent. Also sampled the pork and it was just as amazing!  I would recommend everyone give this place a chance!
