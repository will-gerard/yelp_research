Five solid stars for the best meatballs I can remember eating in a LONG time!!!  YUM!  It also didn't hurt that my Husband and I were able to enjoy a couple of beers in frosty mugs (frosty mugs alone = 5 stars) out on the patio while Freddy whipped up a couple of fresh slices of pizza for us.  Fabulous meatballs, frosty mugs and fresh slices of pizza = 5 Stars in my book!

Go to The Yard House.... For Beer and Food....  Yes - The Yard House is chain but their food is 100000x.  The menu actually sounds more appealing and the food actually is better..  I was looking forward to going to 4 Peaks after hearing great things.  I certainly enjoy a nice cold beer.  (Which they don't have at 4 Peaks - b/c apparently room temperature and slightly colder are the perfect temps to bring out the flavor?!?!  - if thats the case - then why was the frosty mug created?)  Our water was great - straight up honest about what he likes and didn't in regard to the menu - which I really appreciate.  Overall - unimpressed....

Stellar! Stellar Service! And - be sure to remember - if you show up and its packed - look to your left when you walk in - the "faux-counter" is always open!  Huge Menu-Great for hangover breakfast!  Mercy - fabulous waitress!  Get the Baked Apply Frenchtoast - the 20 minutes to make are totally worth it - your coffee cup will remain hot and full!

I can't believe I have lived just down the road from "Live Bull Riding" - the REAL DEAL - for so long and have only just discovered it!  Buffalo Chip Bull Riding / Peanuts / Beer - all beats Scottsdale on any Friday night.  Awesome atmoshpere - Completely FREE if you dont want to drink.  If you do want to drink - be sure to see Joey (female) at the bar on the right as you walk into the place - she is awesome - she will remember your name and your beer and have it on ice waiting for you when you go back for 2nds, 3rds etc.....

Update - We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here - 90% of guests were from "back east"........  To say it was a huge success is an understatement.   Larry the owner / manager is fantastic.   The Buffalo Chip is the real deal and I love it!

DELISH!   It's hard to find 'good Italian' west of NY..... This place meets the craving for sure! The 'complimentary cheesy bread' offers a warm welcome upon sitting down. The food is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are great - not too big / not too small. They always offer a little post-meal Sambuca. They make you feel at home. The place is small - but cozy and warm.  You truly feel like you are at an italian restuarant. Wouldnt call it kid friendly due to the size. Love the menu on wheels.......

Gabi!!  I am so thrilled that you also chose Illume for your wedding photos!!  We had a few messages back and forth about out wedding plans before the big day.  I need to come back and write my own review - but for the time being - if you are considering Illume for any photos for any event - please take every thing Gabi said in her reviews and multiply them by 2 b/c she has said absolutely everything I would!!

Thumbs mostly down for me.  Something important to note - this place is "Babbo" under a different name.   I live right next to a Babbo - so we've been there a few times in pinch... I thought it was strange when I saw the same fancy soda drinks on the menu.  Then the bread came out and it hit me - this is Babbo.  Same bread / same oil and vinegar set up.   The food was fine.  It wasn't bad.  Based on all of these reviews I expected much more - but once I found it it was Babbo Under Cover - I was less than impressed. A few friends and I are doing a little pizza tour of the valley and ranking them amongst ourselves.  That is why we chose this place as one of them - lots of great reviews for a pizza place.  We all agree that after having been to 5 or 6 places on our list thus far - this one is at the bottom.  Not trying to come down on this place - like I said the food was fine - nothing outstanding.  Probably good local spot for those who live over in that area.

Mmmmmmmmm Bloody Marys!!!!! Awesome brunch specials  Super cute and cool - new takes on old favorites on the menu.  Take the adventure and try something that sounds different - its worth it.  AND - Not sure I have ever been to a restaurant with noodle kugle!  MMM good!

Outstanding - I wish I had more time to write reviews of all the places I go - but I just wanted to share a quick review - in a nutshell - definitely a go to place! Yes, the area is kind of shady - and its in a seedy little strip mall - but come on - if you are an adult then get over it.   Food was great, service wonderful and accomodating. Only "negative" was there isn't a bar you can sit at while waiting for your table.  We sat outside at the little table on the sidewalk and had a drink,  The owner told us that the crowd in the rest of the little stip mall wasn't the classiest.  It was totally fine. I never saw the bill so I can't say for sure what the pricing was.  I am pretty sure it should be 2 $ signs.   Some reviews say BYOB - but those reviews are very old and I think before the current owner.  You do not need to BYOB/W

I was so disappointed in the service I received / didn't receive that I have taken the time to add this business to the Yelp directory.   I was suckered into the 'for just $10 more' deal (hand wash - top of the line cleaning inside and out)  and was completely disappointed.  I could have done a better job washing my car myself.  The worst part - I told them I only had a 1/2 hour to be there - at 45 minutes I just said 'screw it' - I'll miss yoga - things could be worse.  Finally after an hour and a half - I have to track down my car.  When I finally do get to my car - it needs to be re-vacuumed - the inside was not wiped down and overall I did not get very much return on my investment.  I spoke to the manager and expressed that if my expectations were too high to please let me know - I really didn't want to be a b*tch - but after 90 minutes and $30 - I figured I deserve a clean car.  So the long and the short of it is - if you want a half a** job - this is the place to go.

STELLAR Happy Hour Prices.......  More $2.00 food options than I have ever seen!  Martinis might have been $3.00? I forget....  But it wasn't crappy well liquor either!  Tons of outdoor seating - but like most PHX restaurants - the views were of the parking lot - as well as Desert Ridge.  Tons of indoor seating as well.  "Acoustics" not so great - but I dont see it intende to be a romance destination.

Love it! Another bartender named David - same stellar service.....  He says "Red or White"  with a couple of follow up questions and again - a fabulous glass of wine.  See my other review for the Sportsman on Camelback...  Fantastic!!!  Thrilled to have a location closer to home.

Considering there is an extreme lack of food options here in "The Creek" - Gallagher's definitely meets the need for: 1 - ICE COLD Beer 2 - Quick / Casual Food  I'd prefer more food options outside of the 'chain restaurant' category.  But I will happy go to Gallagher's any night of the week if it means an ICE COLD beer, the ability to wear whatever it is that I am already wearing, and a great selection of meal options (many are standard chain options - but  there are some extra choices as well).  Did I mention ICE COLD beer - reason alone to go. The only draw back - and this is bizarre - they don't have a beer list.  You have to go up to the bar to look at the taps.  Many of the wait staff have created their own cheat sheet which I find very admirable.   Not sure why the manager has yet to create one himself.  I am a sucker for that silly quiz game - the one where you get the box from the bar and compete against other bars around the country - that is a definite bonus.  TVs Galore!  Any game, any time, any where - you can certainly see it at Gallagher's.  They have pool tables and not sure what else - I haven't ventured into that corner of the place.  There is outdoor seating - with plenty of TVs as well - and the set up is pretty cool - they made it so that you don't feel like you are in the middle of a strip mall parking lot (even though you are.)  Great seating options for groups and families - and they are easily split - when you walk in - the seating to the right is more family oriented - and the seating to the left is more group and 'older crowd' oriented..  They even have those fabulous chocolate mints at the host stand!  Just remember to ask your server if they have a beer list - and enjoy.

If only I still worked at 24th and Camelback!  Sportsman was a required stop on the way home on so many nights.  David the bartender (with the tattoos) was phenomenal - He would ask "Red or White" and without fail I always ended up with a stellar glass of vino.  Same goes for cheese - "hard, soft, sharp, mild" - always ended up with an awesome cheese plate!  (The could use better parking.....)

Food is awesome. No complaints at all about the food.  Our waiter on the other hand - he was cranky and I am pretty sure it started because we ordered our bottle of wine at the bar as opposed to with him at our table.  Kept trying to push more apps and more wine and more pizza even after we were done eating. Even our dessert order wasn't good enough for him.  Not sure what his story was. Maybe it was just a rough night for him.   Like I said food was great but the waiter sure was pushy.

Amazing Customer Service, honest, reliable, speedy.  Needed a special battery for my car - they had it - it died 2 1/2 years later - still under warranty - I called them up and they said call when you are on your way - they had the new battery out waiting for me and I was gone again 15 minutes later with my new battery, new warranty, and I didn't even have to take my wallet out of my bag.  These guys rock!

Awesome and unique selection of great bags and accessories. Prices are much more afforable than department stores and other big name brands and retailers. Selection is always stylish, current and trendy.  And to top it off - you are supporting a locally owned and run business.
