Tonight sucked ass. We got seared. Waited over 15 min to . Had some guest sit down after us and they got THIER order and check before we even got our order taken. Our waitress looks like she is a meth head. Whole staff stood around bull shitting   Finally got our order and I didn't even get my entire order. She finally asked after we was done if everything was ok and I said no would of been nice to get my whole order.  Will never come back here again. I will eat McDonald's cold stale food before coming here again

I went to iPhone Solutions to have my 3gs iPhone looked at after I went to another repair shop . The repair shop I went to told me my phone could not be fixed. iPhone Solutions looked at my phone and found out I just had a bad LCD. This repair only cost me 65 bucks and not a brand new phone like the other shop told me was my only choice with this phone. They was very helpful , honest and very professional . I will be doing more business with them in the future!!!!!!!
