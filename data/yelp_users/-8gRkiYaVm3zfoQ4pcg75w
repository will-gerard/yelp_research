Visited for lunch we ordered chicken teriyaki w/veggies and beef Yakisoba. The food was okay, it wasn't the worst I've ever had but it wasn't the best.  Good place for a fresh quick lunch. The service staff was friendly. They have an outdoor space to eat so you can see the action on Central.

This place is the best. Ive been eating here since I was 5 years old off and on. Every time I visit i enjoy my food just a little bit more than the time before. A sure thing is always the Green chili burrito.  This is one of the Great Mexican food places in Phoenix. If you haven't tried it you are missing out.

The food is fresh and flavorful. I really like the veggies in the Kung Poa dish and also try the egg drop soup and the pork fried rice. I ordered delivery and when the food was delivered the driver was friendly and also most important the food was hot. I've tried several other Chinese spots in the area and none compare to Kim's.

Three words.. gourmet chicken tacos. You must try the tacos. This place is always a great option for lunch or dinner any day. They have a good salsa bar. This place is always better and fresher than anybertos restaurant. Come eat here

Great atmosphere and comfy outdoor patio seating. The bruschetta options were so delicious. The wine list provides a large selection of wine. The wait to be seated was a bit long but worth it. I will be back.

I really really wanted to like this place. I read the yelp reviews before I visited. I ordered a combo plate with a Taco a Tamale and an enchilada. The food looked the part but it was so bland and unflavored.  There are way to many Mexican restaurants to have such a lack of flavor.  I think the cook needs to revamp the recipes or just add some Garlic or Salt.

The food is so delicious here. I had a carne asada burrito with a side of rice and beans and a pomegranate margarita. The meat was perfect so flavorful and not fatty or chewy. The ingredients were so fresh and the salsa was spicy and full of flavor. i cant wait to eat here again. "Mexican food is life." Come eat here.

The tacos do not disappoint. They are located about 26 minutes away from me but its totally worth the drive. Try the el pastor tacos.

Stopped into the Prime on a Monday for a birthday dinner. We had the restaurant to ourselves when we walked in at 8:20pm. From the very moment that we were greeted all the way to paying the bill was such a lovely experience. The food was delicious I had egg drop soup and chicken fried rice. My party shared egg roles and crab puffs and those were very tasty.  We were celebrating my birthday and the lady was so kind to wish me a happy birthday. At the end of a wonderful dining experience the woman treated me with a surprise creme brulee with a candle. She went above and beyond and I cant wait to go back to the prime. The food is delicious and the people are so kind. Thank you for a great birthday dinner The Prime.

This place was great once upon a time. Don't even waste your time. The building is old and the bathrooms are disgusting and falling apart. The service is very bad. The food is better than most mediocre Mexican restaurants but not worth the hassle. Food finally arrived after 52 min wait.  Get it together Los Olivos!

The food here is so good. I dream of the tikka masala. The lunch buffet is always stocked and hot and fresh. If you like indian food or you want to be adventurous and try something new and delicious you must come here for the lunch buffet.

This place is so great! The chicken and sirloin was cooked to order. The pickled onions make the meal. The salsa is fresh and spicy. The staff is friendly. They only accept cash.  This place is a great low carb option.

Carolinas has consistently good Mexican food. The red chili beef plate is always a good option. The Salsa could be spicier but then the gringos wouldn't drink it by the gallons :) lol.

The food and the service was the absolute best. If you are looking for a nice place for an intimate dinner with friends or family this is the place to go. I was very impressed with the delicious quality of the food. Perfectly sized portions so you can still enjoy dessert. I had the fried bananas and Ice cream. This dessert has such an amazing flavor that absolutely nobody should miss out on. I had the lettuce wraps for an appetizer which was deliciously flavored and for the main course I had the Spicy Noodle dish with pork when I took the first bite all I could think was WOW! A good way to describe this restaurant in three words is love, care and quality. You are missing out if you don't give this place a whirl. You will not be disappointed.

The food is excellent. The salsa game is strong. Do not go to this shop if you are in a hurry quality takes a little time. All of their margaritas are $5 all day Tuesday. There house margarita is one of the best margaritas I have ever had.

The pizza was really good. The beer and wine selection had some nice options. Im glad I tried this place I am always looking for a good pizza place.  The only thing I can suggest is maybe some customer service training for servers something is a little off with the staff.

Crescent is the best Venue in town. Ive seen so many amazing artist at Crescent. They have a great food menu and can back it up with flavor. They also are always staffed well for busy nights. If you get a chance go on a 90's dance party night it is the most fun. Ive been to Crescent so many times and I cant say Ive ever had a bad time.

Today's visit to OHSO was excellent. The food was amazing and so flavorful. If you wanna go carb free try the Surf+Turf shrimp and carne Adams covered in pico over asparagus the carne was well Cooked juicy and was not fatty at all.  The back yard BBQ is delicious and comes with all the goodies on the side.

Lots of dishes to choose from. I ordered the chicken kabob and chicken tikka masala spicy. Caution do not order spicy unless you can handle some serious heat. Decent price and good portions. I will visit again, the food was delicious.Next time I'm going to try the Afghani specialty menu.

Great Salon. I would definitely recommend a visit to this salon. They use Aveda products. The gals are so attentive and they really take care of you. I always feel like  #1 priority when I'm here.   I really appreciate the time and communication. So happy I have the exact cut and color I imagined.  Kasey is the best she is an artist.

Overpriced Bad food, bad service, bad attitudes. The restaurant is very dark and the decor is very bad. The relleno was very soft and mushy which made a soggy mess on the plate. Ordered a taco al a carte and requested that they put a little more cheese and the waiter totally ignored my request. They charge for everything extra. What ever happened to good service? They could do so much better if they wanted to. I will never go back again I gave Los Dos uno Dos thres chances.

Clean and comfortable. Nice massage chairs and a good pedicure. I will be back. This place has a nice relaxed vibe.  The staff was nice. $20 pedicure and a nice little shoulder massage when you go sit at the toe dryer. If you pay in cash you get a mini discount.

They have lots of cocktail options and some shot specials. The beer selection is lacking. Bartender was a young guy but crotchety and rude. I guess I'd hate my job also if I worked in a bar on 51st St. and McDowell on a Saturday night. Castaways would be a way better place if they served better beer.

It is always a treat to visit the perch. The perch is one of the few places in Arizona that brews their own beer and also has great food.  Perch is special and unique because it has a outdoor bird sanctuary. If your reading this you should go there and check it out. Call and put your name down for a reservation if you can because it can get very busy.

First visit and I really like this place. They made my meal to order. I just said I want a plate with rice beans and meat and they had no problem with that even though they are a burrito taco joint. The red salsa is very good. My meal was fresh and delicious. The service was good. If you are in the area you should stop at the Burrito House. Come eat here.

The food is so delicious at Hot N Juicy. I do not ever eat seafood or shellfish. We had the King crab and the shrimp and the crawfish.  All Items were served very hot and full of flavor. The flavors are amazing. Try the Hot N Juicy Spicy it might be the best flavor they have. The service was attentive and helpful.  This is a great place for a family night out or a date if you don't mind getting a little messy.  I cant wait to go back for more crab.

Emily and Sam are awesome. Pigs Meow is  the best bar in Arcadia.  I enjoy the music on Tuesday nights. There is always something new to try on tap and so many amazing beer options. The vibe and the atmosphere is so laid back and welcoming.  If you haven't been to the Pigs Meow you should stop in and check this place out.

I LOVE Taco Monday! This is one of the few Mexican restaurants that can do crunchy tacos so well. The Taco shell is crispy and never greasy. The ice cream is delicious and if you go to Diego pops it is a must have.

This is like the Applebees of "craft" beer bars and screams suburbia but it is a decent place for North Phx. The food is bar food and seems like most of the items are in the freezer before being cooked. I visited once and thats all I need. The bartender was the best he was so friendly and amazing.  Seems like a great place to watch sports because they have a lot of televisions in the bar.

Ordered the taco plate with rice and beans. The rice and beans were old and the rice was undercooked and crunchy and also cold. No limes were provided with the tacos. The red and green salsa is bland and lacking flavor. I also ordered queso fundido with chips the queso was cold and the chips were so stale. I love trying new Taco shops and I'm disappointed that there is no effort put into this establishment.  How do you screw up a street taco? This place has only been open for a week and it's already burned out. Go to el supreme down the street way better Mexican food.  $26 down the toilet for street tacos.

The food is so good. I had a al pastor taco and a carne asada burrito both were delicious. The salsa bar is a bonus you have a selection of sauces to smother your food in.   The tortillas were fresh and the food is made to order. If you like tacos and burritos you should come eat here.  I was gonna snap some photos of my food but I ate it to quickly so  Next time.

My Slice of the Pie is the go to place if you want 5 star pizza and wings. You can get a whole pie or just order by the slice. I go in to order when I am visiting the beer garden next door and they are always so kind they offer  to deliver it to me next door.  The customer service is excellent and they are so welcoming. The wings are well done and delicious and they have some original sauces to choose from. I love Mexican food and Pizza so when I find a place that can combine those two flavors Im sold. Well done Randy and team.
