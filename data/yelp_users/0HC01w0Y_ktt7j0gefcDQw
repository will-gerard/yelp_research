Has everything a baker needs. Staff is super knowledgeable and friendly.   Parking is a little crowded early morning Friday and Saturday cause it gets super busy.

Couldn't order togo on the phone,  would have to go into the restaurant THEN togo than wait.  Kinda defeats the purpose.

Service was quick, drink was always kept filled without having to ask.  The fresh wasabi that came with the sashimi is a great plus.  The baked mussel appetizer was very good, it wasn't smothered in faux crab like a lot of other places.  Place that we will definitely be returning to and recommending to others.
