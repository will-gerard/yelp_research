Best experience!!! Food was amazing and service was perfect! We got the 2 for $20 deal and sat in the bar. They were quick to serve us. My fianc√© and I both got the classic sirloin and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Thank you as this was an easy and relaxing evening with no hiccups. Sean was a great server. Also happy to hear that the manager was helping out in the kitchen to make this a great dining experience.

I rarely give bad reviews but I am fed up. I ordered a basket of potato wedges with bacon added. I received my wedges with no bacon and no sour cream. When I finally got our server's attention (Rana) she thought I had ordered it with no bacon and cheese. I asked for a side of bacon to add along with the side of sour cream that was not brought the first time. I got the side of bacon and it was cold. Really? It couldn't have been nuked for a few seconds. It maybe took me 5 minutes to get the side of bacon and sour cream as she took water to the surrounding tables. My boyfriend was out of ranch and after another 5 minutes another server brought us 4 sides of ranch. He then ordered a beer and never asked him what size and brought him a tall. I get that it is a Saturday and ncaa playoffs but every table around us has been checked on numerous times. We've been here during Sunday football and its been a lot busier and we have had better service. We come here a lot and to have this kind of service is upsetting. The wings were also supposed to be boneless for my boyfriend and he got them and they were burnt. Sad. The first few times we came service was great. The bartenders have always been great. Maybe we will need to just start sitting at the bar instead of a table.

This was a much better experience than our last. We did not get to sit at the bar but we did have a table in the bar area. Our server was Vanessa and she was awesome. Came to check in on us multiple times and had a great attitude. Mannylyn  (excuse the spelling) was very upbeat and personable. We told her that even though our last experience was rough,  we are regulars and will still come and enjoy BWW.

We came in to watch the games this morning. There was some frustration in that only one tv in the main room was showing the AZ Cardinals game while there were several tvs for the Vikings game. We asked our waitress if the one to our right could be turned to the AZ game since it was hard to see the one little screen that was showing the AZ Cards game (above dj booth). We unfortunately got our request denied. Jessica T was very gracious and amazing today in that she has asked numerous times to try and get the game changed. She was declined. Minutes later, the same tv I asked to have changed to the AZ game was changed to the Vikings game. No one is still watching this tv. Jessica T was great and very attentive in making sure we had our beverages and kept us updated on when lunch was going to be served. Keep her around. She is very personable and is an asset to RTOS. We love coming here, just wish there were multiple tvs showing all games.

The service the last few times we have been there for dine in or pick up has been amazing. We love the wings and the beer selection. This will be our new hangout and will not be going anywhere else for wings.

Why do I continue to still go here? Cold fries and didn't get the ranch with my Ched'r peppers and no ketchup I asked for. Is It that difficult?

Wow. One of the managers (red hair) passed me twice and made eye contact but never came to check and make sure i was finding everything okay. I have never been in this Michaels and not sure if I will be back. Not a lot of employees available to ask for help. I was checking out and these kids were playing with squeaky toys. The manager yelled at the kids very rudely. Yes it was annoying but I was not going to tell kids that were not mine to stop playing with toys. If the mothers were annoyed I am sure at some point something would have been said. The way she approached the situation was inappropriate. She was also being short with a customer who was having issues with a cricut and wanted to return it and she seemed annoyed having to do a return.
