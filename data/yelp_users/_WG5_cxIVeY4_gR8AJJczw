I'm torn about this place. Beautiful patio, great food and drinks, and even better prices. But in the years I've been going, I have only had one positive experience with the service and server's name is Brittany. If she isn't serving me, I have a server who clearly doesn't want to be there or serve me. I'm having to wave them down to even get my water refilled and not treated like a guest when they are at the table. I don't want to stop coming here, but I also don't know if it's worth it.

Great hole-in-the-wall bar! Good drink prices, and huge menu. Never had anything I didn't like. Daily specials like $5 burgers and taco Tuesdays! Good spot to go before a game or to watch a game.

My favorite coffee shop downtown. Good coffee, friendly staff, and tasty muffins and bagels.

Never have I ever had good service here. I go back for the good food and good prices, but not once have I been satisfied with the service. The bartenders will ignore you long after your drink is empty, not checking in on you once. I find myself always needing to ask for everything, if they even care to acknowledge me. It doesn't ever seem to be overwhelmingly busy, so what else are the servers doing when they aren't at my table for 20 minutes at a time? I'm not a needy customer, but I at least expect the bare minimum.

I've been here once before and had no complaints. Food was good, patio was beautiful, service was to expectations. However, I went back just recently and was not pleased. My two friends and I were not greeted by anyone at what looked like a host stand and stood there for a good five minutes, while servers just stood at the door to the building not looking our way. So we took it upon ourselves to find a table. Almost all had reserved signs which is fine, but with that situation I expect someone to seat us. Once we sat, a server came up and asked if we had just "walked in" and if we needed menus. We said yes, of course, but then she proceeded to tell us that the table was reserved and that any other table would be fine and she would be right with us. We found the only other empty table, and shortly after we sat a man that was with the large party reserving all the tables informed us that that table was reserved as well. I do understand that it is fair for a large party to be dining at the restaurant but I felt as if staff was not paying attention to anything other than that. Frustrated and impatient, my friends and I left.  I am hoping this is a once time instance because I know The Vig can do better than that and I don't want to miss out on their awesome food.

My friends and I had so much fun on this tour. The owners were great, the pilot was experienced (and hilarious), and the locally obtained breakfast with champagne toast was amazing! I would definitely recommend Float to anyone wanting to take a tour and I wouldn't go to a different company if I were to go again!

One of my favorite places downtown! Amazing happy hour specials for food and drink. All of the servers and bartenders do a fantastic job and really seem like they enjoy working here. Food is fresh and delicious. Try the lychee infused vodka!

$15 bottomless mimosas, well worth your money after 3 of them! Service is quick and friendly and my food was piping hot when it came out! Everything has great flavor to it and the recipes are really unique. Perfect cure for what you may have been doing there the night before ;)

Great place in the middle of downtown Phoenix! Many menu choices and the adult milkshakes are amazing! I had a simple build your own salad but it was very good and I could tell my chicken was grilled fresh. Had great service from the girl behind the bar, didn't catch her name but she had blonde hair. A bit pricy, but you get what you pay for.
