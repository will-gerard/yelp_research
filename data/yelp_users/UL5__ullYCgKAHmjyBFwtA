The last time I went to Bikini, I went up to the bar to buy an enormous, delicious, and miraculously cheap pitcher of blue moon. Beside me sat an old, drunk, and shady character. I tried not to look at him.  He waited until the bartender turned away to fill up my pitcher, and then he leaned in and whispered, "You're cute. I had to wait for her (the bartender) to leave so I could tell you. You know, the creepy old man rule."  As soon as she came back, he turned away and stared down in to his beer.  That's right, folks. Cheap blue moon and the bartender enforces a "Don't Be a Creepy Old Man" rule. What else could you possibly want in a bar?

ASU, you suck. It's unbelievable how much you thoroughly, utterly, entirely suck.   It sucked to transfer to your sucky campus. It sucked to park. It sucked to be pillaged for every penny I didn't have. It sucked to show up to sucky classes. It sucked to have to dodge the sorority/fraternity students. It sucked to have to see the same 100 young marrieds in every single one of my classes. It sucked to try and see my sucky advisor. It sucked to apply to graduate. It sucked to wait in the freezing cold at 7am for an hour before convocation. It sucked when you tried to tell me my degree wasn't done because one of your sucky teachers didn't post my grade. It sucked to have to make you fix your mistake, dragging your feet the entire time.   I am NOT a sun devil, regardless of the thousands and thousands of dollars it cost to get my undergrad from you. And I don't ever want to see your sucky face again, ASU.

Listen, friends. I am going to tell you the secret to having a good time at Amsterdam:  Pre drink.   Otherwise, the $6 for a Blue Moon on tap and the complete inability of the dj's to mix the music becomes irritating. I just want to drunkenly dance the night away and I don't want to have to stop because the dj dropped the beat! Please!  Pre drink, friends. Pre drink until you can't hear the bad transitions. Pre drink until you're likely to join the boys on the dance floor doing the Single Ladies dance.  Pre drink so that you can leave your wallet at home!  Pre drink and then you will have fun. Shake it to Brittany and Rhianna with the friendly homos on the dance floor. When you get tired of that, go outside and dance on the makeshift dance floor to some different kinds of tunes. When you get tired of that, sink in to a couch to people watch the diverse crowd. When you get tired of watching the gays, watch the latino kids and the goth kids walking back and forth to the clubs next door.   And then, if you live near by like me, you can stumble home afterward. Anything within stumbling distance gets an extra star! Hooray!  The only time I didn't have fun was on a first friday. Apparently that's when the bitches come out to play!

I know it's totally creepy, but I fantasize about those sweet potato fries and aioli. Like a bathtub made out of sweet potato fries and filled up with aioli. Or a sweet potato fries swimsuit in a swimming pool of aioli. You get the point. I'm not proud of it. Especially because adding $6 fries to my $9 veggie panini is not a frugal choice. But there is no way I can go to Delux and not get those goddamn fries!  The kitchen is open late 7 days a week. It's wonderful. I can get my fix at 1:30am on a Sunday, even! If You show up near typical dinner time, though, prepare to wait. Try not to stare too hungrily at all the patio diners stuffing their faces with burgers and beer.   The service is usually decent and the food is yummy. But all the bread and cheese and, yes, sweet potato fries, make me feel a little regretful and terribly sleepy afterward.

Scottsdale is not my usual scene, but I went to Axis Radius a couple of weeks ago with a friend who was home for winter break.  It was worse than I expected.  I spent all of my money and didn't even get drunk. What the hell? The men were MERCILESS. I expected them to be on the prowl, but it was ridiculous. Every 5 seconds I was trying to escape from some new guy  trying to grind on me. I do NOT know you, please don't touch me with your wiener! Even just walking through the crowd, men were grabbing at our hands and hips trying to stop us.   The music was ok but it was impossible to really dance to it. The drinks are too expensive to get nice and intoxicated from. I don't understand the point of this place, then. It must be to hook up. I know of better meat markets, I won't be returning.

I have a Carly's problem. I could easily eat there every day if I had the money. I order the Europa every single time. So freaking good.   I appreciate a place that puts thought in to their vegetarian options. And any place that serves yummy food late at night. Everything is fresh and delicious! I enjoy the bar, but I feel like the martini's aren't quite what they used to be. If I'm going to spend $10 on a drink, it better make me warm and tingly.   Service is slow. The kitchen is slow. Expect to wait, but expect the food to be worth the wait!

Carly's, I owe you an extra star. After talking smack about your not-quite-stiff-enough martinis, I went back and had the most marvelous, intoxicating martini of 2009. And then our wonderful server suggested a drink called a Death in the Afternoon. And...well...I'm sorry, Carly's, for my absinthe related behavior that followed. I hope we can still be friends, but if you don't want me anymore I would understand completely.

I feel like such an asshole for never having been here before this week. A friend recommended it to me saying, "it's kind of like Lux, but gayer and nicer". Sounds good to me!  This place is so cute! There are few tables outside and even a little fire place. Inside feels spacious even though it's not a large place. The coffee is fine, nothing phenomenal but tasty enough. Everyone was friendly.   Two things that made me fall in love: $2 enormous iced teas FREE SOY MILK. Well, maybe not free...but I've never met a coffee shop that didn't charge half a dollar extra for soy. THIS IS AMAZING. I was so pleased when I ordered two medium sized iced white mochas with soy and my total was only $8 and some change.   I wish I had come here sooner. I could have logged all those college study hours here rather then all those other lame soy charging snobby barista'd $5 for a microscopic small cup coffee shops. Ya know?  I can't wait to try the hummus plate and their veggie sandwich!

I'm a little bit in love with Ticoz right now.   What did it? $2 margarita Wednesdays, of course! Delicious and strong. We've been going weekly to taste all of the different flavors. The passion fruit one is my favorite at the moment.   The martini's are also fantastic, but I can't afford those all the time :)  I don't always order food, but when I do I am pleased as punch. I had veggie enchiladas and everything on my plate was delightful. I've also had the caesar salad, which was crisp and zingy and perfect.   I'm happy with the service. Ricky is my favorite. I also adore the sweet young man who works the bar.   We had a weird experience the other night though, when an employee kept hitting on my date (HELLO! GAY RESTUARANT! SHE'S A DYKE, BACK OFF! Silly boy) but that has never happened before.   Now that we have a card that tells us what the daily drinks specials are, we will surely be back more often. We'll be there on Wednesdays, of course, if nothing else!

Homme is my favorite bar.  I was disappointed when they took down the rainbow flag from outside, though. Now when you show up to support your favorite bartenders and DJ's there's far too many straight boys staring hungrily for this queer girls comfort. I'm glad Homme keeps its arms wide open for everyone...gay/straight/bi/scenster/hippie/goth/young/old blah blah blah...but Homme is a gay bar at heart!  Most of the bartenders are awesome. If you're respectful and generous they will return the favor.  The music varies throughout the week. Party Foul Fridays bump electro, Resurrection Wednesdays  will give you industrial and 90's alt. The music, regardless of the day of the week, is sure to offer a breath of fresh air to anyone sick of and annoyed by typical club music.  Come to dance and people watch. Watch out if you drive there, though. Cars get smashed into in the parking lot sometimes, and cops like to hang out near by to catch you trying to drive home!  Edit: I took away a star because of how much fun I did NOT have last night at Party Foul. Where did all those Scottsdale bitches come from? Why were all those boys standing around on the dance floor when I was trying to dance? Why did that new door guy give me a hard time when nobody else did? Arg! It might be time to find a Friday night place that hasn't been infested with the masses yet :(

Over the past couple years of my life, I have spent way, WAY too much time at fair trade. Reading books and drinking coffee is like my 3rd job, and I prefer to do it at my neighborhood cafe.   If I want drip coffee (which is almost always) I will go out of my way to come here. It's simply delicious. If I want something else I might go elsewhere, but nothing else in central/uptown/downtown Phoenix can compare to a Fair Trade Iced coffee.   The barista's are sweet, the live music on Saturday afternoons is a joy, the community computer has saved my ass at least a dozen times, it's "coffee with a conscience", and it's a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Of course it gets 5 stars!

I might be a little over eager here, but I am so excited about Bar Smith! Angelina C., Khamis H., and I went this Friday for the time. Paid the $5 cover with minimal bitching. Went upstairs and immediately began dancing our feet off.   The music was wonderful. Electro-y and cleverly mixed. The crowd was  deliciously diverse and dancey. My favorites were a black couple that danced on each other, eyes closed, nonstop for the entire night, the enormous and muscly European guy who put my dance moves to shame, and the bouncy, pretty girl who I fell in love with. I fell in love with at least three girls on the dance floor. A good night, I'd say.  I don't know about the drinks (I had been pre drinking before I got there, obviously) or the scene downstairs. I will be back to check them out. I am so glad to have an alternative to Homme or Amsterdam for the nights I want to dance!

Conspire is independent, open late, and yummy. Everything I look for in a coffee shop. You'll be a fan if you miss Counter Culture or Willow House.  The owner makes a wonderful latte. He steams the milk perfectly, better than most baristas in Phoenix! I just wish he had brewed coffee. Sure, the espresso is good, but it is not a replacement for a thoughtful, well mixed, drip. No, I do not want an americano instead. I want a cup of coffee!

Ah...Sunnyslope.  A one time haven for tuberculosis patients. A one time meth capitol of the United States. A one time skinhead stronghold. An all-the-time wonderful, delicious, and unique cultural kaleidoscope!  This is where I was born and raised. Once a Sloper, always a Sloper. Ask anyone who has been lucky enough to live nestled against the North Mountain Preserves. Also, we don't appreciate being called sunny slop, so cut it out.   Considerable wealth and considerable poverty live back to back in Sunnyslope...and we all shop together at our sketchy Fry's on Cave creek and Hatcher. You're guaranteed to hear a variety of languages while you browse the produce.  And, sure, you sometimes hear the cacophony of gunfire echoing elegantly through the mountains. And Crackheads On Bikes are a VERY real driving hazard. But Sunnyslope has it all:  -Grinder's: our very own locally owned coffee shop that roasts it's own beans.  -The Community Center: where kids can play basketball and old folks can dance.  -The Sunnyslope Artwalk: art and culture every 2nd Saturday.   -The Humane Society: attempting to control the roaming dog (bred by the meth heads?) population.  -Bomberos: delicious and stylish South American wine bar.  -El Rancho Market: so good, so Mexican, you might forget what country you're in. And the only place I can buy my favorite Mexican candy.  -The canal: on which to jog and in which to fish when the cops aren't watching.   -Sunnyslope Buddhist Center: for enlightenment.  -El Bravo: for the best Tortillas in the city.  -Tacos Jaliscos: for authentic Jaliscan food and authentic mariachi every Sunday.   -The mountain preserve: of course.  See what I mean? Delicious! I love you, Slope.

I am surprised by the mixed reviews here. I adore Moira.    I'm always happy with the music, the service, and especially the food. I love that on a friday or saturday night on foot downtown, I can stop for some yummy food pre-dancing or post adventuring.   I've been slowly but surely sampling all of the rolls they have for happy hour. The kani crunch is delicious, as is the white blossom and fried tofu and just about everything else I've tried. The seaweed salad is what dreams are made of. The drinks are good, too. I really enjoy the lychee one and the orange blossom.   We always have Heather as our server and she's terrific!
