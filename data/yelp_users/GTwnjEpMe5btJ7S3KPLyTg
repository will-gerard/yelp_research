I have been to this place 3 different times and have not been happy once. I have had the whole gamut; full set, fill, and a gel manicure. The biggest issue I have is not the customer service. Everyone is very pleasant and kind. However,  all three times I've been, I've ended up simply going back to another nail salon within a matter of days to have my service corrected (gel peeled off, acrylics were sharply square, despite my request for "natural" and "rounded", or- in the case of my new set- the tips jutted up from my nail bed in a very awkward vertical direction). I'm not sure if maybe it's a matter of seeing the wrong nail techs, but after 3 times, I won't be back.

Dr. Bob is the best! He's pretty much part of our family now. We've taken our GSD to All Creatures since he was a baby, and our recent adopted Lab became a patient as well. Dr. Bob always takes his time and answers all of our questions thoroughly. He also gets to know both of the dogs, their personalities, and my fiancee and I. He remembers details that we mention in future visits and that really makes a difference. Also, the Veterinary Assistants are always nice and welcoming to the whole family. I'd definitely recommend All Creatures if you are looking for a great vet!

We recently tried this place for the first time and I'm so happy we did. It's certainly not the closest place to us, but based on the Yelp reviews, I thought it was worth the extra 10 minute drive to try. I have two very large dogs that are both only around 1-year, so you can imagine the anxiety that I would have not knowing how they will behave, and if they will become traumatized. The staff at My Dog's Hair Salon are the perfect people to patiently care for your dog and give them some TLC. The atmosphere is relaxed and all of the dogs get to remain off their leash in between each step of the grooming process if you wish. When I arrived to pick up my dogs after their 4-hour appointment, I was paying at the counter and could see them in the open area hanging with the other dogs. To my surprise, they hardly noticed that I had returned, seeming like they'd be content hanging for another few hours! As I was checking out, Erica told me how they did and went through what all they had done which I appreciated. She also told me that our larger German Shepherd has dry hair (thanks to his time in the pool) and recommended a fish oil supplement in his food to help! I was so impressed with the care and thoughtfulness of the staff, and of course the great results. My two squeaky clean pups will definitely be going back when the time comes!

What a wonderful time. We have been for lunch before, but tonight we went for dinner and it was great. Softly lit ambiance and MASTERFUL cocktails. You must try the habanero pepper margarita.

Absolutely one of the best date-spots in Phoenix. The menu has a little bit of everything. from light and healthy, to decadent and rich. The service is (usually) very good, and the ambiance is quiet and candle-lit. Keep in mind- if going for dinner and drinking wine and appetizing. it can get pricey.

I will start by saying that the food here is amazing. I continue to come for it despite what I will go on to say: the service is very poor. Time and time again, I come back with an open mind and already low expectations, I am let down once again. They seem to always be grossly understaffed, their preparation is not consistent and the place has not been clean the last few times I've been in. Tables sit un-bussed while hostesses sit at the front and chat. All in all- not recommended and I cross my fingers hoping they will get it together.

This is a wonderful little sandwich shop. They have an awesome menu that includes tasty sandwiches and fresh salads at reasonable prices.  When I went to Chloe's, I ordered the cold Roast Beef sandwich and my friend got the Asian Chicken Salad. They were both delicious. My favorite part was the homemade chocolate chip cookies; MMM! The service at Chloe's was also great, but it's important to note that it get's VERY busy during the lunch hour, so plan ahead some extra time!

Cheryl is a skilled therapist, and one of the only in the area who practices lymphatic drainage massage. She has a very calming demeanor and always makes a point to provide recommendations that can help with whatever ailment or pain even after the treatment. Cheryl is a true professional that has a real passion for helping people. Lucky to have found such a great and trusted therapist.   As a note: the address on the listing is not current. The current location is: 7024 E Osborn Rd Scottsdale  AZ 85251

I sent an email to Adam to get more information and schedule an appointment to get a single replacement window on my vehicle tinted. Initially, Adam responded in 24 hours. But, once I then responded with times and days that i am available in order to schedule an appointment, I did not hear back. After a couple days, I went to a more professional and customer-service oriented business. Their service was also $15 less than what Adam had quoted me in his first and only response. (Dann'y Family Window Tinting).

I finally tried and am so glad I did! Definitely not your typical dog. Warm and easy to bite into, and wrapped in delicious bread... what was that, pita?   Definitely try... you'll be glad you did.

Windsor is like young Phoenix's old faithful. This is a wonderful restaraunt that is appropriate for almost any occasion. It is hip, but not TOO hip. It is modern, but not TOO modern.   There is plenty of variety on the menu which is overall pretty casual. This is great for a girls night or a date night. I have not been for lunch or brunch, but i'd imagine that sitting on the patio on a spring day is great.

Great burgers and great service.  Really small restaurant where you order at the front and they bring it out. Decent selection of canned sodas and bottled water in the cooler next to the register. Food came out quickly and was hot. The only thing to be aware of is they have no healthy options. The burgers themselves probably have more cheese, grease etc. compared to most others.

I am so happy with the top-notch doggy service we have received from Lucky Me Pet Care. Hans, our 11-week old German Shepherd absolutely LOVES when his friends Laura and Gen come to play! They always send pics during their visits and leave detailed notes about what happened while they were there. It makes me feel so at ease knowing that when I can't be there to feed or play with our baby, he is in the best hands. Also, Heather, the owner, makes everything so easy. From answering all of my questions, to scheduling (even last minute); she makes sure that each puppy parent is just as happy as the dog! Highly recommend Lucky Me Pet Care if you live in their service area.

I am hooked! Tried it once on a whim and have been back at least 3 times since (a two-week span of time, mind you). The decor an ambiance here are just so-so. It's a very casual spot, and not romantic, but is great for a low-key meal or dinner with a group. Most everything served here is local and prepared fresh daily. You can definitely tell!  The Inca salad is wonderful; so many unexpected flavors. Add shrimp for a healthy and satisfying lunch. If you are ready to splurge-- the BLT & A is a MUST! It's huge though, so consider sharing it with a friend.

I can't speak to the quality of work as I decided not to have my cracked iPhone screen replaced here. I walked in to get a quote and was shocked to hear they wanted $129 to replace the screen. That is more than the Apple Store. When I said that's too much thanks anyway, the young kid at the counter proceeded to negotiate the price down a couple of times until it was 109. Still, Apple themselves will do it for $120 which is certainly the best with OM parts and extensive knowledge of the device, so I'm not sure how this place could charge anything over $80. In any case- the lesson learned is that you can likely expect a better deal if you push back. I wasn't looking for that but could see their prices are not firm.

One of the best nail places I have been to aside from an expensive, high-end salon and spa- and, even in that case, I feel they are just as good.   I dropped in for my first time for a manicure and pedicure and was greeted and seated promptly in the spa pedicure chair. In general, the pedicure was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. When I was introduced to the woman who would do my nails, I told her I like a very natural look and wanted white tips (I called it a French manicure, but this style is apparently an American manicure). She told me she knew exactly what I wanted and explained how she would do it (I wasn't familiar with the products she noted). It turns out that this salon uses a wonderful product called SNS, which is an all natural, powder alternative to acrylic. Having never heard of or seen this, I was skeptical as she got started, but let me tell you, the result is amazing. I am so happy with the SNS product, and I can't wait to try more colors at this nail salon/ the ONLY in the valley I've seen that uses this product.

These guys are great. Called them first when we had an unusual amount of bees near the pool. Within two days, we had a pro out ready to take care of it! Scheduling was very easy, and treatment was straight-forward and effective. I especially appreciated that the exterminator texted me afterward to give me extra details about the situation. If the bee problem arises again, we'll definitely be calling The Beehive again,
