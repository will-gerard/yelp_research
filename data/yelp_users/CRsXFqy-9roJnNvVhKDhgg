After a less than stellar dinner last night, I had to try an off the strip locals joint for an early dinner today to restore my faith in Vegas cuisine. A good friend recommended this place and after hearing about it, I had to try it out.  A very quaint converted old brick house close to downtown,  Joe's did not disappoint.  I caught them in between the lunch and dinner crowd so it was quiet.  Service was great and the food was awesome.  I had the baked lasagna which was fresh and full of flavor,  a nice chianti and of course tiramisu for dessert.  All made fresh,  in-house and it tasted like it. This is a new Vegas favorite for me.  If you're in town for a visit, get off the strip for a bit and visit this place.  You'll also love the prices....

This is hands-down one of the best dining experiences I have had in many years.  I travel quite a bit for my job and I am fortunate to have an opportunity to eat in many of the nicer restaurants around the country, but I have to say that I have not experienced anything like Binkey's anywhere. My girlfriend took me to Binkley's for my birthday this past weekend and it was simply a wonderful experience. The care and expertise of each course was amazing.    We each ordered a 6 course dinner with wine parings so we had an opportunity to sample almost every dish on the menu and I don't think there was one that we weren't amazed by.   The only thing that was more impressive than the food was the staff and their impeccable service.  Timing and attention to detail was flawless.  Like the food, I have not experienced that level of service and attention in many years either, including what some consider the "finest" restaurants in country.  You could tell everyone truly enjoyed working there and had a passion for the experience they were providing for their guests.  Thank you so much to staff at Binkley's for making our evening and my birthday a very memorable one.  We'll be back soon!

On the road again, this time in beautiful Las Vegas. Stopped  in for a quick burger for dinner here figuring how hard is it to mess up a burger when it's actually part of your name, right?  Wrong!  To top it off, they were running a restaurant week special, usually designed to showcase what you can do to promote your restaurant. This was an all around fail. The special offered pita chips and spinach dip, a couple of burger prions which I choose the pastrami burger,and cheesecake for dessert. The dip was good,  unfortunately the pita chips were burnt. Not sure what they were trying to do there.  Then comes the burger. Only the burger in the middle of an otherwise empty plate. Not even garnish.(maybe they were trying to showcase...?)  Basically a pretzel bun, burger cooked a perfect medium-rare, (realty the only good part)  1000 island dressing (aka "special sauce") grilled onions and a pile of thick cut pastrami. First on a burger, the thick cut meat was way too much.  Hard to bite thru everything, and since the bun wasn't toasted,  the special sauce soaked thru the bottom turning the whole thing into an over salty (heavy pastrami) mess. Sat at the bar,  was never asked how everything was, not even when they picked up the plates with only half the burger eaten and most of the app left.   After 10 minutes of sitting there with no other service I finally just got the check and left skipping the last part of the dinner which was a piece of cheesecake.  I was never even offered the dessert ...  If this is how they show what they can do for restaurant week,  I'm glad I didn't get any deeper into the menu.  Next time in Vegas if your at Ballys or Paris, this us a definite skip!  To many other options for good food!

Great service and an easy transaction. I had a couple rings to sell including an engagement ring from a couple of years ago and Eric took the time explain every step of the process.  I had  hoped for more dinero  for the diamond but he even took the time to show me "real" values of similar stones on the retail market. Hmmmm, gold and diamond jewelry isn't always worth as much as we pay for it...go figure! :-P  I received a check  right there, a very fair price for my rings and I was on my way in less than 15 minutes.    Very professional, easy and fair. Thanks Eric!  (now I have some change for Alleycat and some Vans from the Sidewalk Surfer...)

Some of the best bruschetta anywhere and on Monday and Tuesdy nights, they have a $20 Bottle & Board special. Any bottle of wine and board of 4 types of bruschetta. Awesome deal but expect it to be busy.
