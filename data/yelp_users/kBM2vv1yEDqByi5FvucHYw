Okay,  so, I'm reverting to wanting to be back in my twenties. What can I say?  I took my cousin and his wife to this Hookah bar.  LOVED IT! The only reason I didn't give five stars was because I still think more could be done with the atmosphere.  But hey, it's Tempe... land of a million different opinions.  The Sheesha was excellent!  Very smooth.  No burn, no headache afterwords.  The staff was very friendly, very accommodating and did a great job of keeping on top of our needs.  The choices to blend for flavor were out of this world! Can anyone say "almond joy?"  SWEET!  If you want a really nice experience, go ahead to the Red Sea... I'm pretty sure you'll be happy.  I'm Hook'ad.

I don't know why I didn't write about this place before.  It's a regular haunt of mine.  The owners who are always mistaken for regular staff because of "working" so hard and not just "managing" make this restaurant fabulous!      First the menu.  I haven't come across anything like it to compare it to.  The Chef is actually from France.  I say this because he constantly comes up with different food choices not expected from someone trained to cook in Europe. More West by Southwest than European.     Favorite Must Haves: Lamb Malotes, Prime Rib Tacos, Frutes de Mar and their desserts.   They offer "bite" size of most of their dessert menu so that you can try more than one.     When the weather is nice, they have a HUGE outdoor patio on the lower deck and when the evenings are nice an upper deck that looks over the views of Carefree.  Thursday nights include live Jazz musicians.     I think the thing that hooked my hubby and I was the first time we were ever there, "Tim" our bartender leaned over the bar, shook our hands, asked us our names, told us his and treated us like family. We've been going there three years now and they always remember our name!     If you have a special event that takes a party of five or less, call for a reservation and ask for the table in front of the fireplace by the front door..  They won't guarantee it, but will give it to you if they can.  It's the best spot in the house!     Did I mention they make an AWESOME red sangria? I could write on and on... you just have to check this place out!

Just an update.  New owners took this place over about a year and a half ago.  It is better than ever.  They constantly have great entertainment and the food is always fresh and has a little different twist.  The wait staff always gives a friendly "your in our home and we adore you" vibe that makes for a huge faithful following.  Best Coffee haunt in Cave Creek!

This place will BLOW YOU AWAY!!  If you appreciate the culinary expertise that is truly given to only a few.... this is one of those places!  The food is designed to make your mouth excited at every bite!  It is a known fact that our brains recognize something new, and then after a few minutes adjust. So, the best the food will taste is within the first two to three bites.  The whole menu is designed this way.  Small portions, but many, many WOW's for your mouth.  I don't care where you've been in the Valley... nothing compares to this restaurant.  It is a bit pricey but worth every penny!  I would suggest doing the wine pairing that they offer with the different courses.  The wine pairings are perfect and make the whole experience all the better.  Service...excellent, Food... Outstanding!  I highly suggest a reservation two to three weeks in advance if you are wanting to dine between 6-9 on the weekends.  Also, if you have a Birthday or Anniversary, they will print the occasion special on your Menu.  Very slick!

I was turned on to this Tearoom by my good friend Cindy.   The place is small and very darling.  You walk in and immediately are greeted by the owner of one of three other women who work there faithfully.  The decor is very Victorian.  There is a wide variety of beautiful China tea cups, pots and teas for sale as well as many other items to compliment a formal tea at your home.  When you enter and are seated, you will find beautifully laid tables.  The table is laid out for a formal tea.   They offer everything from fresh, out of the oven scones to the traditional tiered plate offerings of finger sandwiches, cheese and fruit.  If you are wanting something more substantial, I would recommend their bread pudding (to die for!) or their beautiful Waldorf salad.  The food is very fresh, prepared well, and presented well.   The selections of tea are vast and they also offer a tea of the day just to keep the variety going.  While there, you are offered to "dress up" if you so desire.  A darling array of Boas and Hats are offered to guests to use while dinning.  They are great for pictures and make a special event all the more festive.  Besides the ambiance, the food is always of excellent quality.  Fresh, and the best of everything is used.  Please save room for dessert!  You won't want to miss their traditional English offerings.  My only complaint with the place is that the tables, chairs, and room are small.  There isn't much room to move, and the tables are packed together pretty tight.  If you are any bigger than 5'2" and 100 lbs, you will be uncomfortable in their chairs.  Very small and not good on the back.  If you are wanting a darling experience with a Tea Room, with excellent food, you won't be disappointed.  During the peak season you will want to make reservations.  With a small amount of tables, they fill up fast and are a favorite in the Carefree area.  Enjoy!

So, I went into Old Town Scottsdale to meet my daughter for Happy Hour. LOVE this place! First of all the seating is separated subtly.  You feel like you have your own space but get to enjoy being with all the other patrons.  Very well designed.  The low ceiling of the restaurant lends itself to a very quaint feeling. Well appointed and designed with a unique twist.  Not your standard decor for a restaurant with an Asian theme name. Great outdoor patio that flows into the main area so that you can look out onto the street whether you are seated inside or out.  Our waitress was excellent.  Attentive and followed up without hovering.  We couldn't ask for better service.  I started with one of their signature happy hour drinks. "Turning Japanese" which is a pear cocktail.  Perfectly yummy!  Not to sweet, not to dry. (Happy Hour specialty cocktails are half price.  Right on!)  They offer all their appetizers half price as well for happy hour.  We started with two rolls; a rainbow roll and a lobster roll.  Both very good and fresh.  We followed  up with scallop sliders....FABULOUS! These must be tried, they are unique and wonderful!!  They also have a very unique list of flavored infused Saki.  If you love Saki you will want to give these a try.  The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is because I will want to come back and try the full menu, not just happy hour.  But, from what I've seen and experienced, I would suggest this Sushi style restaurant to anyone!

My Girlfriend had suggested this restaurant and wanted to go for her birthday.  So very glad that we did!  First the web-site.  Impressive, easy to navigate and very informative!  When you get there, you notice a very nice outside seating area.  Informal but intimate.  It is summer though, and I didn't see any misting system, so I don't know how much use this will be during the hottest months of the summer.  Once inside the doors... BEAUTIFUL! The staff is well trained and even if no one is at the hostess stand you are noticed and spoken to immediately!  The interior is beautifully appointed!  Who ever was their interior designer....rock on!  The waitress was there as soon as we were seated, was professional, made excellent recommendations and was spot on with all her knowledge in helping us with our choices. I highly recommend the pork shoulder, very tender and juicy.  The food is prepared and presented elegantly but not presumptuous.  Portions are small but the quality is high!  If you are a big eater, this is not the place for you.  If you are into food for the taste and preparation to enjoy well prepared food that has a little bit of a different twist... this IS the place for  you! My negatives, and why I can't give a full five stars is because of the seating and lighting.  Although I understand that they were trying to make the most of  space, the bulk of the tables are done in long booths with chairs on the opposite side of the table.  This means that you have tables (in most cases) immediately to the left and right of you.  While conversant with your table, you are privy to the entire conversation of the tables on either side of you and vice-versa. I find this distracting.   The mane private table requires a group of at least 6.  So, privacy is limited.  The lighting is very low, which while adding to the atmosphere, does nothing for trying to read the menu.  I would be fine with this if there was enough candle light on the table to tilt your menu to to read, but that isn't even close to adequate.  If the servers offered a pen-light, that would be the ideal. That all being said, I have no problem recommending this restaurant and will happily return. Every thing was timed well as far as when our different food items came out.  We were never rushed.  I like that!

I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed. The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls. All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh. Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back. Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.

Hello friends!! It's been a bit since I posted. So here goes.  I have had a good time trying out different Wine bars. This one sucks ass tasting wise. (Randy's words not mine) I bought a Groupon to this place. It offered for $10 a $20 value of a wine tasting for two and cheesecake for two. For $10 can you go wrong? YUP! You can.  Now let me say this, the owner was super nice! Local Cave Creek guy. My stomping grounds. Super casual. A little to casual. Nice store, greets you as you come in, etc. when we shared with him that we had been by twice during posted hours and that the place was closed, he casually responded that he had a baby and would head out early to put his baby to bed. Touching; (Later found out that the baby was 2 1/2 and that sometimes he went home early to watch football....hmmm?) bad business practice. If you aren't t open during posted hours, how do you run a business? I could go on about this, but I digress. He gave us several options besides those listed on the Groupon. I thought this sounded amazing! A $20 bottle of wine. Four beers, or your choice of any combinations of 8 wine tastings. All included the cheesecake.   Let me say this about the cheesecake, it was good but it was served in individual jars that made it look like baby food! The presentation was less than appetizing.  We made the choice to allow him to choose the wines. We wanted to try wines we had never tried before.  The wine choices were, well, NASTY!! I can get a better shot at a decent wine by rolling the dice in the grocery store, bottom shelf, $3.99. (Sad)  Four of the 8 wines had started to turn to vinegar.  I'm not sure how long the bottles had been open, but they were just stuffed with their corks.  No rubber suction stoppers to keep the wine from turning.  For all I know, they could have been good wines.  Again, not professional.  For an owner and purveyor who goes to wine tastings and sells wine for a living I was sadly disappointed. Cave Creek is full of hidden gems, this is not one of them.  Now, in fairness, I will say that he poured us a wonderful Pinot Grigio.  I purchased this wine.  it was smooth and well balanced.  This was surprising since I was more interested in the reds....gross!  On a positive note, he does a lot of fund raisers for wounded vets and has been quite successful in raising money and awareness for wounded vets and their needs. For this reason I would not totally snub my nose at this establishment. Remember friends, life is to short to drink nasty wine!!  Until the next time!

The Culinary Dropout has been open 3 weeks now. I give it a 4.5.  Not 5... read to the end to find out why.     I went for lunch yesterday with a friend to check it out.  I LOVED it!  First, I must admit that because it was a beautiful day in Scottsdale my mood was happy to start with.  As we stood outside the front door admiring the patio and deciding if we wanted to go in or not, a very sweet young lady left her hostess stand inside to come out and greet us.  I like this.  She could have waited for us to come to her.  This tells me the restaurant wants business and has trained their employees well!  Right away you notice the atmosphere.  Hip and elegant with a touch of years past... hence the magnificent chandeliers that draw your eye up.  The seating has a look of baroque meets modern.  Well designed, plenty of space... you don't feel crammed into the other people around you.  We of course chose to sit outside because of the beauty of the day. It took no time at all for a very sweet and adorable waitress to greet us, get our drink orders and give us a few explanations of the house specialty, the Anti-pasta bar.  Before I get into that though... I must recommend a Pisco Sour.  Not many restaurants offer them or even know what they are...definably one of my fav's and believe me... I make them well.  The Anti-pasta bar is designed to let you pick and choose for either an  entree or an app from a wonderful choice of excellent cheeses, salumi's ( that's right... NOT salami... true lovers know the difference.) olives, marconi almonds and so much more.  Your choices are then beautifully laid out on a  plate after being hand sliced at the bar where you are encouraged to watch the artistry.  On to lunch... I chose a wonderful Smoked Chicken Salad.  They smoke their chicken right there on the sight and I have to say... it was fantastic!!  The pears that had been sweetened, the endive and the pistachios that accompanied the salad to be tossed in a fantastic vinaigrette. It was sublime!  Our meal was finished off with their famous monkey bread that came with a beautiful scoop of ice-cream.  Yes, all the way around I loved this place.  The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because I will go back and rate the bar.  This is typically the heart of an establishment and will have a lot to do to determine return customers.  Look for my review on this.  Happy eating everyone!!

I recently moved into a home that was built in the late 80s. None of the window coverings had been replaced and were original to the house. I started with the master bedroom/ bathroom, guest room and guest bath. I am THRILLED!! My sales person, Holly M really knows her products! She steered me in the best choice for my needs! She quoted me that day, measured a few days later and got my order underway. The installer was polite, on time, clean, careful with my home and fast!!  The Windows look fantastic, they filter light so I don't feel like I am in a cave, they are easy to use! I could not be happier with my experience with this company and highly recommend it! I will be doing the rest of my home with PSI and looking forward to the process!!

I went to try this therapy with my family. Was nice because with four pods we could get an appointment at the same time. Had such a great sense of "well being" after my session! Slept like a rock that night!! Highly recommend!!
