The absolute worst pharmacy I've ever dealt with. God forbid if you have a chronic illness and need to deal with these unprofessional lackeys on any kind of consistent basis.  Be prepared to be treated like a total criminal if you ever have the misfortune of needing pain medication, and even though you've gotten a legitimate prescription, be prepared for the rude blonde girl with the vocal intonation of a vacuum cleaner to treat you like a junky.  Complain to a manager? They give exactly zero cares. Call close to closing? They'll leave you on hold until they close and leave.  Call with a problem because they keep refusing to fill your prescription? Get ready to literally break down into tears out of pure frustration and prepare to hear such nonsense as "well, if you want this filled then you need to make sure your doctor writes it on the secure paper." Um. What? As a patient I have to check and see if my prescriptions are written on magical paper? What are you even talking about?  They will take 4-5 hours to call your doctor if there is a problem, if at all. They will call you 900 times to tell you to pick up your meds, only to not have them done when you get there. If you have someone drop off your scrip, they will ignore hipaa laws and discuss your medication with that person.  They will have you make multiple trips, give you partial fills, and talk to you like you are the dumbest person alive. I'll be transferring all of my meds to another location, since I'm forced to use CVS. But holy moly, this pharmacy is toxic and needs a serious overhaul.

great coffee, great atmosphere, but really hipster baristas who possess just a little bit of 'tude.

I'm not understanding the recent rash of lackluster reviews. CiBo is consistently awesome, tasty and efficient. Better than  Bianco without the three hour wait. Adorable setting, great staff and beautifully community minded, holding yearly fundraising events for local charities. CiBo is the real deal, and if you folks who left bad reviews don't come back? More pizza for me!  Ps- zeppoli? Heck yes.

even though getting the tamales is sometimes a pain, because they sell out so quickly...they are absolutely worth the wait. They are moist, delicious and made from fresh ingredients. So good, that they even serve them at blue agave.  try the green chile and cream cheese and the red chile pork. Delish.

Super quick, courteous and helpful. Also gave us a great referral for a locksmith who can do motorcycle keys. I totally recommend them.

There's being treated, and then, there's being cared for. When you're at Acuhealth, you are definitely cared for. Every detail of the office is created with your comfort and serenity in mind. Robert is an incredibly intuitive, thorough and approachable healer with a refreshing viewpoint on health and life. He's greatly reduced my carpal tunnel pain, and my migraines. His total health focus, results in you, being cared for as a whole person, not just your ailments.  I'm only disappointed that it took my friend so long to give me the recommendation to try Acuhealth!

Talk about top-notch customer service! Gail, Julie, Angie and Steve were all so helpful and accommodating in helping us get what we needed. They even helped us arrange an unorthodox pickup! Great company to deal with, cannot recommend them enough.

We've been to Hek Yeah several times. Tonight's visit sealed the deal. We will never be back. If you're going to have your restaurant listed on a service lik GrubHub, you should probably have a working phone line (all circuits are busy now, call back later) and good communication with GrubHub. We ordered our food at 6:30, with a pickup time of 6:55-7:05. My husband arrived at 7:00 and the restaurant said they just received the order. The place was completely empty. He waited 30 minutes past our pickup time for the food to be done. No apologies. Then the kicker? Charged us .79 per little container of sauce. That's like making someone rent a fork. If I was dining in your restaurant instead of takeout, would you charge me for sauce?   Crap service.  Never again.   Tried to support the little guy, and did so at least 10 times. This is shabby.

We've lived in this area for awhile, and have been bummed at the lack of decent restaurants close by.   Problem. Solved. Pezzanos is in an unassuming little spot in an office type complex. Pizza? Phenomenal. Thin crust, flavorful crust and just the right amount of cheese. Our lunch portions of pasta were HUGE. The meatballs have a beautiful texture and are delicately seasoned. Penne with broccoli? Yes.    We were served by the restaurant manager who is attentive, and hysterically funny.   We will definitely be back.

Excellent cold-brewed Americano and grapefruit mimosa. Easy parking. Deliiiiicious. We will definitely be back- order the popovers. They will not make you sad.
