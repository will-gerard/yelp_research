The food here is yummy for the money :) I tried the Birria de Chivo (lamb in a tomato type of gravy), came with Rice and Beans as well as a stack of small, thick flour tortillas...all for $6.75. The lamb was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth....totally delicious and definitely ethnic Mexican cuisine at it's best!

I have been coming to this place for at least 3 years and still can't get enough. It's an odd location, considering they're right next door to another Chinese Restaurant, but the food here is fantastic.  The service is always quick and the food is delicious, my fave: Beef Chow Fun. This is one place I don't mind picking up the tab :)

So my boyfriend wakes me up this morning and decides that I need to check out Joe's Farm Grill for breakfast. I was reluctant due to the travel time, we are in Tempe. But can I tell you, this place is fantastic!!!!  I had the Green eggs and ham scramble....yummy, you can taste those fresh ingredients, especially their home -made pesto.....delicious.  We're on our way back there again today for dinner!

Unbelievably horrendous customer service......I was itching to visit this place since I spotted their ad when driving past a bus-stop. I finally get the chance this past Friday (03/26/10), as I pull up to the parking lot at approx 9am, after unloading my vehicle (two babies), I walk up to the front sign and notice that the hours list they will open at 9:30am. Sigh, oh well, there is a bank across the street which I need to visit in any case and make a mental note to be back promptly at 9:30am so I can get some 'cheap' shoes!   Back to the store at 9:30 on the dot, only to dismount again and again I notice the door is still locked (searching the windows for any sign of life or at the very least a telephone number....no such luck). I google the name of WFS into my phone to retrieve their number and proceed to make contact.....   Much to my surprise, a young lady answers the phone and I inform her that I am sitting here, waiting in the parking lot with two screaming kids and it is now 9:36am and they are still not open....   This young (very young) lady then informs me that they only open at 10am and also proceeds to inform me that she is the manager, the only person in the store and that she is currently waiting on another employee to arrive so that she may depart to go fill up her drawer & that the owner of this shop is not in town........TMI anyone!?!?   I then kindly ask why there is no notification on their door/window listing this change in hours, 'the manager' then informs me that there really isn't a change in hours, they just open a half hour later. I proceed to inform the manager that there have already been (by my count) at least ten women that have been just as disappointed as I, in trying to walk into the same door within the past half hour (BASIC ARITHMETIC: 10 women x $10 Shoes = $100, in this kind of an economy, one should never turn this down).   At promptly 9:58AM a paper is stuck on the front door notifying potential clients that WFS opens at 10am 'EVERYDAY'.   At 10 am I walk into the store (2 babies in tow) and proceed to inform the manager that not only is it a security issue to be informing me that the owner is out of town and that she was the only one in the store (I have worked within the Finance industry for the past decade and am very familiar with security breaches).....but that she should have considered notifying her clients much in advance in the change of hours.   After finding myself in a heated exchange of words, the manager informs me that I do not need to tell her what to do and that she is refusing me service. Before departing, I ask for her name, which she refuses. I then ask for the owners name and telephone, she then claims that the owner does not take phonecalls......is that so?   (Note to self, retrieve the name of the owner via the internet)....but I must ask - WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 'THE CUSTOMERS ALWAYS COME FIRST?'   I suppose the motto for Wholesale Fashion Shoes is: CHEAP SHOES, EVEN CHEAPER SERVICE!
