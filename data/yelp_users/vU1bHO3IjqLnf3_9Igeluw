Waitress good, bartender slow... Could have a few more drinks but.... Could not order since bar backed up. Need more staff on the floor. Oh and this little gem! (manager did make right but I pointed it out), drinks were not consistent in volume.   Moscow Mule in copper cup was 30-40% bigger than in a glass. Because we were having those we ended up with multiples in glass since they ran out of copper mugs. We did the water test (pour from glass to copper mug) and was 30-40% LESS! Pointed this our to the manager (Adam) he said he was aware but disputed the 30-40% claim, said maybe closer to 20%! WOW, don't admit that! . I told him to head over to the table and we will show you. My issue is this, HE KNEW IT! The price is the same, but you are getting less. I told him that the house wins every time in this situation. Less Drinks, Same Price! Did, I mention HE KNEW THIS! With a $300+ tab, he comped 3 Drinks ($36). He attempted to right a wrong, but only after I made a big deal about it. Thanks for the 3% comp on my 30-4-% less drink! Great decor, waitress was great, but based on the inconsitance of the amount you are paying for...WILL NOT BE BACK

Perfect from start to finish.  I wanted to wait a few months and make sure everything was done as expected.  We did a layover my current asphalt shingle roof.  Jared came out, walked me through the whole process and why Lyons would be happy to do this job.  I made it very clear that I was going to have multiple quotes done and he gave me some great tips and questions to ask.  After that whole process they were a bit higher than most (about $1000).  After a conversation with Jared he was able to make the number fit a bit better.  My concern was quality over price and I made that very clear to all roofers who came out for an inspection/estimate.  They came out on time to start the job.  The crew was very informative and courteous.  The job took about 2 days longer than anticipated....BUT, I wasn't going to be home, and it was my roof.  It could have taken them a month and it wouldn't have hurt my feelings.  When I got home from my trip I had a new roof, new ridge top vent, new chimney cover, painted roof fixtures, and a new ac unit put back exactly as it should have been.  Yard was spotless as well.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.  Another very deciding factor, was they would handle any and all insurance clams due to hail, rain, or wind.  That's really important as those things are common here in Arizona.  Piece of mind, from a great LOCAL company, that follows that up with great work!

This place is awesome! I was recommended here by a family member and couldn't be happier. I am my dogs parent and I do everything to keep them healthy and safe. Shot on time, extras if needed, etc... This place has never pushed anything that was not needed. I have even had phone conversations with the vet, that allowed me to treat without heading into the office. Yes, I respect my dogs and the vets their, and they do the same for good owners. Debbie and Jordan in the boarding are amazing! All the front office girls are amazing, the vets are amazing! I wish I could name everyone, but they know who they are. My puppies Leona and Oreo love heading over and I would never hesitate at anything they recommended, as I know they have the best interest of my pets in mind! Great Great Staff, professional clean, respectful and vauable!

OK...this has nothing to do with this U Haul location, but has everything to do with the policies they carry.  I rent a truck, state to state 1 way, truck is great.  They price matched budget truck and even got me some other freebies (blankets, dolly).  BUT...when you pick the truck up it was on 1/4 tank of gas.  They say bring back with at least a 1/4.  How am i supposed to know how gas I'm going to use?  How do I leave the truck with 1/4 tank of gas?  Get gas every 100 miles and not fill up?  When you have a policy like this the only person who wins in UHaul.  Rent a car, bring back full, why cant UHaul understand this.  Full is full, and its really easy to do.  "Sir/Mis, remember bring the truck back full or its $5 a gallon."  No problem, but to bring back at 1/4 tank, and if its over that, thanks!!!!!!  Bad policy by UHaul.  BTW, this site, easy to find and the guy who checked me out, did that, checked me out.  Once again this is about UHaul and the shitty policy they have!

PERFECT SERVICE.  One time, extremely willing to help with special request.  Did I mention on time!!!!! Drivers Eric and Ted were both very happy to hear our stories, and trials in Vegas.  Just a great service and great people to engage with arrive to Vegas, and leaving!!!! Good value built into the price. Water champagne, roses for the ladies.  2 stops if needed.  Just a great joy, and way way better than the hotel shuttle, or the crazy cab driver!!!!

Wow,,,,this was one of the worst experiences ever.  We to have some lunch here, which was highly recommended by some friends.  We sat down outside on the patio...waited 5 minutes to get menus.  OK, I understand, if they were busy, which they we not.  Ordered a couple of water, so we could look over the drinks and food.  When the water came, my literally had floating objects in it.  OK, ordered drinks, then food.  Here is where stuff gets bad.  Like the 5 minutes for menus and floaties in the water wasnt bad enough.  44 minutes later, we get our food.  1 sushi roll, and I chicken wrap.  44 minutes.  NOT ONCE did the waitress come by to check on us.  No second drink, not sorry for the wait, not sign of her at all.  Food came, it was good, nothing worth the 44 minute wait.  Of course we were done eating prior to the waitress coming by to check on us.  So, I had my card ready, cause over an hour for a quick lunch simply did not fit into my schedule.  I wont be back.  There are way too many places in Scottsdale that provide good service and great food.  I was not expecting anything other than good food and average service.  AVERAGE service would have made this review 3 starts,. but I guess shame on me for just looking for average service in Scottsdale.

Good hotel. People where very helpful, clean, fun. Got a great rate with my player card and though we'd try them out. Got a great "$20 trick" upgrade, 25th floor, "honeymoon suite". No view, but the view I'm looking for in Vegas is the stack of chips in my hand. Long taxi lines tho (TIP...walk next door to Cesar's, 7 minutes away, and get taxi from there. Will save you at least 15-20 minutes). Good hotel, great bar across from the check-in. My girl said "MMMMM, best Bloody Mary." Maybe it was, so it was from the feeling the night before left. Will be back to stay as soon as my comps come in!!!

Worst service ever. Vegas is a service based city.  Bottle service is great, BUT only if you have a waitress.  Had 2 bottles, 4 people, and saw the waitress 3 times!  I did speak with a manager and he helped the bill total out a bit. NOT as much as I would have tho.  I will never go back, unless someone else is flipping the bill.  Best part was the fact I was surrounded by other VIP hosts from other clubs, and they all agreed, HORRIBLE SERVICE.  Real buzz kill to what would have been a great night.....

Birthday party for wife. Reservations for 12 @ 6pm...Nope 8 people at 7:30. Hope it gets better.... Beyond the reservations being messed up, and serve being a bit slow, food was good! It was restaurant week so maybe that was the downfall of service. The Roasted Prime Rib was awesome!  UPDATE: I was contacted a few short hours after my review and they are truly committed to service! Based on the offer they have extended to my wife and I, we will be back. 2nd review to come........  Ok, went and used the very generous offer from Chelsea's. Service was much more improved. Food was still really good. Food was never the issue, it was service. Great friendly, fast, no issues. Must have just been a fluke the last time. Will be back! Thanks Chelsea's for making this what it should have been....a great dinner to start the night!

We never go to breakfast, but glad we did.  Happen to be in the area and great place.  Good portions, good value.  Had the breakfast Chorizo and was really really good.  If it was a bit closer to home would definitely go back.  If I'm in the area, we will be going back!

Want great service, great food? This is a great spot for a romantic dinner, or just some great grub before a night on the strip. Been twice, different meals each time and EVERY TIME GREAT!!!! Little pricey on the drinks, great value with the food, considering the 20 items you get before you even get a menu. Cheese, bread, something else I didn't try, and even some muscles!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!

You have never had service until you have stayed here!  First off, a Roles Royce phantom ghost to pick you up from the airport. Then no lines anywhere.  Special entrance, escorted to the room, special elevator, a butler.  Yeah, its really that good.  Unlimited Voss waters.  Mini bar, is a real bar.  Oh, then you get to the room and realize its 2 stories and could sleep 12 if need.  Room was modern, full features, perfect.  If you have some dough to throw at your room, here is the place to do it.  We stayed 1 night and wish it was 3, but we had a prior reservations at he Mandarin Oriental on the strip.

A bit pricey, but it was my B-Day and I had alligator arms.  Will be coming back, especially to have a loaf of bread with pesto.....

Really good lunch specials.  Bruschetta was really good.  Awesome that you get to pick 3 different types to try.  Its a wine bar, and I'm not a wine guy, but the wife loved it.  Split the bruschetta and a chicken wrap with fries.  Fries were seasoned perfectly.  Some of the best fries ever. Good portions sizes, and good value.  Will be back.

Another hidden gem. First, great staff top to bottom. Organized, clean, up front. Second, Laney is a badass artists and tattooist. Got 2 very emotionally tied tattoos on my leg and are very happy with them. Great conversation, solid work. Will be going back for more work. Great place that cares about it the art, not customer counts. Thanks team Mastodon.

Had 4 different TOP RATED AC companies come out to quote my new home (14 year old AC unit) for a new AC unit.  Marc from Day and Night was not only 1 of the most thought, they were also the best value for my money.  All of my duct work was thrashed, and needed to be replaced, also need additional vents added.  They are 1 of the very few companies that will not take any money until the job is completed.  NO DOWN PAYMENT, that's simply unheard of today.  The team came out on time and got on started quickly.  They had the whole job done within a day.  Which was great!  HOWEVER, we did run into some issues.  The team did not have all the vent covers with them, also did not know how to install my "special" thermostat.  The next day they sent out a rep to install my covers, as well as help with with some concerns I had.  My living room was HOT, and I was willing to give it some time to work out the kinks.  He made a couple of adjustment and was on his way.  The following week another tech came out in install my ecobee thermostat, which turns out to not be installed that day.  Another slip through the crack issue.  The first crew did not run a new thermostat wire from the unit.  Not an issue because the old thermostat was working and the house was being cooled.  HOWEVER..again, I had concerns about my hot spots.  Turns out the unit was only wired on the low setting (2 stage unit) so it simply could not keep up with the heat.  The new tech wired on high, per my request, so I can get a feel for it working fully.  Another week and they send a tech out again to set up the thermostat.  Gets the new wire ran, and thermostat done within a couple of hours, and all was good.  A couple of weeks later everything is done and Marc comes out to give me all my warranty info, rebates and payment.  Went ahead and added the extended warranty to the unit (simplicity of having 1 company handle all my issues if U have any).  Great news (I did have to tell them about my rebate i did qualify for, they thought I was not SRP), I get a $300 rebate on my new system as well.  After 2 months, no rebate, so I called to get the scoop.  Turns out the appropriate paperwork was not processed!!!!  Great companies will fix this problem, since part of the deal with Day and Night is they handle all of this paperwork.  The simply said they will cut me a check for the $300.  I follow up a few days later and they were able to push the rebate through SRP.  Either way is good, just now I'm 2 1/2 months farther out.  I still have not received my rebate yet (as of today) and the last conversation I had with Day and Night was July 31st......  Very long review, but wanted to point out everything.  Great value for my money, yes had issues, but they took every step needed to make sure I was satisfied.  Now as soon as I get my $300......  Thanks again Day and Night AC Team!

Great Service! Very fast and knowledgeable staff. Brought wife's car in that had a flat tire. Turns out had 2 nails/screws. Not only did they fix both holes, they did it for nothing. Dropped tire off, 2 hours later all done. Even offered to put back on the car. Was presses for time elected to put on myself. Will be back!

I gave them a chance...and they failed.  I came in and mentioned I was in a bit of a hurry (my mistake).  Was up sold to a wash and wax, with $15 off. ($49 normally, got for $34).  I was OK with that.  The guy asked if I had a coupon,  they don't have a website, so no...BUT, I will love to review you guys, cause based on what I see you need some help.  They guy laughed and said, we will take care of ya.... Yeah, thanks.  So 1+hour later wash and wax done.  Outside of the car looked good (8.5 out of 10) and inside was OK (7-10).  Hurried home (cause I was already late).  Went to open the back of my car (I have a Dodge Nitro and the back is where I let my dogs ride)....NOOOOO!!!!!!!  Not only was the back not cleaned, THEY DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT!  My mistake #2, make sure to tell the car wash people you want the WHOLE car washed.  So, I had to do the  "car wash after the car wash" at home routine.  If I had more time I would have brought it back, but of course MY MISTAKE.  I tried, I went against the reviews and wanted it to work.  They are close to my home, but guess what....NEVER AGAIN.

WOW, ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I'VE EVER SEEN.  Opening act was OK, but short as well.  When the top arrived it was fast paced, very energetic, very topical.  He was having a great night it seemed.  The sounds, lights, music, video...all on point.  Very small venue so everyone has a great seat.  Great performer to audience interaction.  SUPER CHEAP TICKETS for a great great show.  I could see him again in 3 months, because he is so topical his show is always changing.  From Micheal Jackson, the Tiger Woods, to his part in the hangover movie....doing coke, all awesome.  Worth the price X'2.... Great show KT, see the show and it will make sense.  Thanks for the Birthday shout out in the front row last night.  And, BTW I hate crown royal, but a b-day shot with a fellow going away redhead....CLASSIC.  See the show peps, its a great value and well worth every penny!!!!!

Cant wait to go back.  Perfect menu, sliders, regular and large.  Sliders are perfect to try a few different items.  They offer exotic type of meat, based off the "season".  I had buffalo, and kangaroo.  Yeah, kangaroo.  It was good.  I've had kangaroo in Australia, and this was just as good.  Waiter/bartender gives great options on the items.  Not only that, give you suggestions on what to eat first, based on "richness".  Mac and Cheese as a side is awesome.  A little different twist to traditional mac and cheese.  Will be back, and cant wait to try even more options.  Oh, drinks, as everything else....GREAT!

Some people just don't know how to have a good time in Vegas.  Worked with a great VIP HOST Thomas, look him up, he is awesome. 23 people, and of course bottle service.  Price are what you would expect in Vegas.  BUT bottle service is always worth it if you know hoe to use it.  I called my host, told him what i needed/wanted, told him where i wanted to be, who i wanted as my security....DONE DEAL.  My VIP HOST, MY SECURITY GUY, MY WAITRESS....ALL couldn't be better Call VIP HOST Thomas, take care of Chad, and see Arriana, or Suzie for some kick ass drinks  Rok is not TAO, its not PURE, it a fun club.  Yes if you want to say you partied the same place as some B level celebrity, then go to those places.  If you want good, fast music.  If you want great service, if you want to have as much fun as you want, go to ROK.  Its small yes, but spend the extra $$$ and bottle service.  Get in touch with a host and make it happen.  Yes, I've been to Tao, XS, Jet, LAX and The Bank, all have the good and bad, but Vegas is about service.  I don't like being forced to tip because someone thinks they deserve it (IE the door guy who decides who comes in now or later) I don't want to wait for 2 hours either, but how much is 2 hours worth.  $200, $300...if your spending that, GET BOTTLE service. I had 23 people with 8 bottles, any mixers you could ever want.  Was never once pressured into getting energy drinks, buying bottles of water, nothing.  The only thing I got pressure from was from my boy Chad (security guys) in making sure I was having a good time.  If you take care of them, they take care of you.  They would walk the girls to the restroom....can you get that at any other club in vegas?...try  Music is loud, current, with great classic Rok mixed in.  I can only listen to lady gaga so often, but when she is mixed with ac/dc, maybe a little flo rida with boston, you never know what great mixes are going to come up.   Some really low reviews for this place, which I just don't get.  If you want to get pushed around on a dance floor pic any of the 55 clubs on the strip.  That happens in all of them.  People sit in every club, old people wonder in every club, and drunk people spill drinks in every club.  Its not ROK fault some people cant party.  The fun is there....you just have to have it

Great line from a friend....."ROK is like high school. You have the cool kids (XS, TAO) then you have the kids who just like a good time (ROK)" I'm bias since every time I go, its better and better. Just give it a try, ask for CHAD SOLIS or CRAIG KEENAN, they will make it all right.   People judge this place before even walking in, small yes, bottle service yes, packed, yes, good music, yes...will cost you $300-$400 less to go there YES. Will you have a hangover, sore throat, bloodshot eyes........yeah, same thing you will have anywhere you go on the strip

Was lucky enough to have my best man plan this hotel for my bachelor party stay.  Rooms are top notch all the way around.  Service is amazing, food is great, room was perfect.  Its a no gaming hotel, which is nice because everything does not smell like smoke, and you don't make a stop on the way to the room.  Strip locations is perfect and close to all.  Will be back!

First time ever using a "Pet Sitter" service....and WOW! AMAZINGLY Great! Filled out the online questionnaire (a bit long, but very detailed) and had the first get to know each other appointment. Spend about 30 minutes with Cinnamon going over the dog details. We have 2 great dogs that love people and to play. Cinnamon was very good with the dogs, they were very good with Cinnamon. I have cameras at the house and was able to see what was happening and the DOGS LOVED HER! She played, hung out, did more than I would ever expect! Texted to let me know how things were, was very detailed. Left a 4 page summary of the visits. VERY VERY DETAILED! Will use again, and again! Get service, very affordable, very safe.

Had lunch here after a hike.  The menu looked great.  Very limited (maybe 20 items) but all sounded and looked amazing.  Tried the sausage wrapped pancakes, I think that's what it was called.  AWESOME!  Had the breakfast burrito , you build your self, really good also.  Perfect for after a morning hike!

Yeah, amazing.  Split a burger and the beef and sausage.  AWESOME. Yes, as good as the reviews state.  Weird location, but well worth it.  They don't do much (limited items), but what they do the do amazing!

Called at 7:15am, received a call back at 7:55am.  5 Minutes before they are scheduled to open.  Sent out Josh the same day to take a look at a leaking valve in the back yard.  Was very honest, and said to do a couple of things and will return to fix on Wednesday.  Not an issue since the water was able to be turned off.  Was going to replace the pipes connecting the valves (3 valves).  Estimate was $110, with $10 off for the Angie's list coupon. When Josh returned on Wednesday (at 9am, the scheduled time) and went to go to work.  5 minutes later Josh tells me the valves were simply loose.  Was really cool and just said how would anyone know when its under water.  After talking about if we should move forward with pipe replacement, based on his suggestion it wasn't really needed. After he tighten all the valves, and checked for leaks, said he was going to do an evaluation of the whole yard.  He checked all heads, coverage and anything pertaining to the sprinklers.  Not only did he do all that, he set the timer, and made a couple of adjustments.  After all this (about 30 minutes worth of work), wrote a check for $45.  Only charged me to re-wire the valves and the the yard evaluation.  Would use these guys again and again.  Great service, and extreme honest and fair.

Had a little party at a friends house.  He ordered Thai Chili, for delivery (out of the delivery window).  Not only did they deliver farther than usual, it was the owner who brought it.  GREAT FOOD!  EVERYTHING was awesome.  Not as spicy (5) as may have expected, but was really really good!

Food was a 4 star, service was a 1. Ordered a drink, waited, and waited, and waited...Then, heres the food. Told the waiter, he said, my bad, let me go get it. Then came back and asked what I had. He acted like he wrote it down the first time. Obivouly didn't! When I say waited, I mean like 20 minutes. Had the burger, it was good. Overall the group of 9 was not overly impressed. Some like the food, some did not, but we all agreed that the service was HORRIBLE. With some many great places, I will try something new before I head back!

It was Restaurant Week, so we save a few bucks.  The meatloaf was great, my wife had the scallops, and seemed to love them.  Drinks a bit pricey, but when your meal is about half what it should have been.....  Chopped Salad..yeah, its as good as everyone says...but get this, you can remove the salmon, and add a different meat.  If you ask.  Ask your server about R&D.

Great place. Busy, loud, fun, modern. What a sweet place to hangout. Where can you get bottle service, of a keg of beer?  Yep, here is right. These guys spent some money to make this place first class. How about a stage above the bar idea.  Just creates a great vibe for everyone. Girls dressed for Vegas, to guys just looking to hang out. I will be back

Oh no, the dreaded Urgent Care! Think about what you know of an urgent care. Ok, now forget all of it. This place was awesome. Clean, Friendly and FAST! I live about 10 minutes away, made a call to see what type of wait time there would be, girl said no wait. Walk in, empty. As far as I was concerned, NO WAIT! 5 minutes of paperwork, 5 minutes of vitals be taken, 10 minutes with Dr, 3 minute for prescription. That's it! In and out in less than 45 minute. Huge, awesome, and great. Dr. Alexandra (I hope thats her name, if not, sorry) was awesome. Friendly, funny, and staraight and to the point. No time wasted. Heard my concerns and addresses them. If and when I need a qucik look, I will be going back here!

BAD ASS!  XS, Marquee...No, a club with normal people wanting to have a great time, YES.  I did have a solid hook-up, (Chad Solis, ask for him, tell him I sent you) a great friend of mine.  We have a bachelor party of 10 guys, of course bottle service, perfect location.  We were the center of attention, over looking the dance floor.  Security, Waitress, Dancers, all perfect and amazingly good at what they do.  I have done Marquee, XS, Pure, Hard Rock, Etc...this place had to be by far the best crowd, best time.  Will I be back?  Not if, but when!

16 Reviews, and its hidden.  I will leave this review somewhat vague, as that's what they want.  Its an old school speak easy.  Really good drinks, very knowledgeable mixologist (not bartenders).  Parties over 6 will have a tough time sitting together as the place hold 30 people.  This is not a great place to "pre-party:, as they will ask you to keep it down if needed.  Great place to have a drink before hitting the rest of Scottsdale, of 1 after dinner.  Remember, this is a little place, but everything is hand made.  10 minutes for your drink is expected, but well worth it.

Never have I written a review just moments after a service/visit. Wow, this place was great. Sean (owner) is a great young owner. Local, knows the value of service & understands the what trust in a mechanic is. My wife's cars AC died, and I cannot have an uncomfortable wife! Without an appointment I showed up at 7am, the moment they opened. Sean not only got the car right in, was quick to figure out what the issue(s) are. Without being solicited to fix anything else. He not only asked how I found him, he told me about an amazon local deal he was running. Mind you I have already made a choice to have him fix my car.  Without a mention he told me how to save even more money at his shop. That's like going to the store and having the clerk give you the coupon price without the coupon!   Sean escorted me to his shop where he could show me the issues and possible problem areas. As a full service shop, he point out other recommended items, WITHOUT EVER being pushy, forced or making the conversation uncomfortable. Most people hate when you get an oil change and your estimated bill becomes 14x the oil change. He simply said these are a couple of things that could use service. I completed agreed and he is working up pricing on them now! Within 1 hours the AC is working correctly and we have an appointment for next week so he can follow up with his fix.  Great guy that I will trust to do any auto work. He is in business to change the stigma of an auto repair shop. Sean, great job, great shop, great value. You will have a normal customer from now on!

Came back for a little AC issue. SOLID GREAT SERVICE.   Sean was quick to diagnose and fix.  45 minutes the issue was diagnose, fixed and paid. Was asked to come back in a few weeks just for him to just "re-check" to ensure the issues does not arise again. Most places don't ask, they just expect. Great personal, proactive service!  Great, local buddy auto type of place. You feel they are there to help and not overcharge. Thanks again Sean!

Really Cool Spot! A bit of a weight on a Friday night, but it cool that you can have drinks & apps on the patio. Drinks were good and strong. Chips and Salas really good too. Tacos are street style so small in size, large in flavor. If you r hungry, ap and maybe 3 tacos would be perfect.

You have McDonald's and Bobby Flay. You have Panda Express and Nobu. You have the lobby bar and Fizz. Yes, drinks will take 6-10 minutes, but they are real drinks. When I say real I mean, not out of a soda gun. These are really shaken, with passion. Real ingredients, real drinks. This place is small, so if you wanna make something happen, hit up the Vegaster app and make it happen. See Tim, thanks for a great night of multiple night caps. Seriously.... Great spot and be prepared to have some soild real drinks.

HOLY COW! First great spot on the strip, great looking place. BAD: The 19 minutes we wait (after we sat down) for any type of service. Now, ok, maybe nobody saw us. OR the fact that 2 managers were talking less than 6 feet away THE ENTIRE TIME didn't see us too. It's vegas, not too many people are in a rush, and neither were we. So I decided to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait...for 19 minutes. THEN I asked the managers, "Is 20 minutes the right number to wait before service"?. They were sorry, comp'ed 1 drink and went along with their day. BEST PART, I happen to run into another manger weeks later and he offered to show me the right service levels. Maybe I go back, but with so many great places on the strip....maybe not.

59 minutes to get food, after amazing seating service. Yeah, it's not crazy busy... Trust me. 59 minutes to wait for Mac and cheese WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. Food does arrive... 'Mac and Cheese'...say WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. Server then asks me..'I think so' ? Then 12 steps away, then 12 back... We're good. 12 bites in guess what.... MUSHROOMS. NOT A LITTLE BUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL STEAK. Cool, I have a semi food allergy and avoid them at all cost...but. Our server was good, apologetic, tells the manager. Here is where the process is awkward.   Manager appears, to apologize, and offers a free drink for the road. OK....I understand this is Vegas but know this: I live here and my business is here. A free drink does not save you a 1 star review. A $200 bill with a food allergy mistake solved with a $2 product cost comp? Ugly ugly ugly.... There are way too many options on the strip to have this. Now, Scottsdale, San Diego and the rest of the Yard Houses will not be seeing me again. A huge mistake like a food allergy would, I would at least expect, more than a free well vodka and cranberry to fix.

This could be a very bad start. 6 customers, 6 employees and 60 minutes to get your food. Good news is that we were eating AFTER arrival, if not...time to re-book that flight. SUPER SLOW!

Tom, you would not be happy. It's dead at the bar and everything is a 3 step process. Order, in system, ask again about what was ordered. Bartender actually asked me, "it has not been that long... Right?" If you're asking about my 2 Sliders I orders 20 minutes ago.... Yeah it's been that long. Cool, thanks for the other 5 minutes added on for the Blue Cheese to go with the Buffalo Sliders.   Just bad. Slow, not friendly, just not a good experience. I can't imagine what it will be when it IS busy.

So, it became time to start doing more with my life. My wife (who is smoking hot) teaches and practices yoga nearly every day...Sometimes twice a day. My schedule is flexible which means it's easy to not get moving. Made the move to try crossfit. Here are the /impressions/results after 4 visits in 6 days:  Location: Perfect, less than 10 minutes from my house. Safe public area. Clean!  Times: Perfect. 530am works nicely into starting my day. Now, they have other times (4-5-6pm) that could fit into others as well. I like the am because they are smaller classes for the time being.  Since I am just starting out, I like the extra focus you can get with a smaller am classes. My first class was 3 people, my 2nd was just 1 on 1 with Shane, the owner. Boy did I cry like a baby that entire day after. Good tears of sore muscles.  Crossfit vs Gym: Now, I'm about 15 lbs over my goal number, but want to get in better shape vs losing weight. I know I could hit the gym, so some random things and lose the weight, but not gain the better shape and feel.  Crossfit is a different full body shape.  Instructors: Truly is no ego with this crossfit class/location. The instructors are students. They get down and dirty right with you. They all have goals just like any of the student/members. Very encouraging.   Atmosphere: Solid. You are there to work, but they encourage some fun along with it. Very personable. "How was your weekend" is a normal question, not "how do you feel". They want to know you vs getting you in and out.  Students/Members: Great group of people sweating just like you are. Everyone has a level and goal. Nobody acts better than someone else. "Knuckles" after a hard set are pretty common.  After just a few sessions/visits I do enjoy getting up early, getting beat up during my workout and feeling better throughout the day.   Shane the owner runs a great spot. Cory and Kari are great instructors that will absolutely get me to my goals.  Don't be intimidated by the "Crossfit" stereotype, give this spot a shot.

Just an update. Been coming for 6 weeks+ and have built a new sweaty, sore family. Everyone is super friendly. Coaches are extremely professional, personal and informative. Members are all apart of the same team, regardless of the level of fitness. The misconception of crossfit is people are swinging hammers and flipping tires. This is not crossfit. Best part, 7 day free trial with great class times. Every achey sore muscle, sweat covered shirt & empty water bottle are worth it. Yeah, you can say I've drank the Kool-aid but love every minute. Thanks Shane and Cory for welcoming me into crossfit family.

5 stars are not enough! About as real as it gets. 40 minutes of training really brings you into the real world of what our great armed services do... On a very basic level. Gator is the man. Even with his bigger Phew Phew gun. Once the experience starts it's 2 hours of an Adrenaline rush. Zombies, Searching, Breaching Doors! Seriously, everything in Vegas is in excess.. This is nothing but amazing. Thanks team ACO and Vegaster for the recommendation. WILL BE BACK.

So, Air Duct Cleaning has alot of negativity around it. TV specials about providers adding on services that are un-needed, shady work and up charges galore!  Found an online coupon for a $49 basic duct cleaning. Basic cleaning is a very simple vacuum suction on 1 vent to "pull" from all the others. This will get the very loose dirt. Was recommended to "Clean" the vents. Being I have looked in the vents myself and ran my hand inside, I could see this is possible.   Each Vent was $20 each, Return was $35 each. 1 return was less than 2 years old, the other was clean already. They did not push to do them, as we all could see they are fine. Opted to move forward with the cleaning. This is a brush attached to a drill in which is ran through the duct work to loosen and release the caked on dirt and dust.  Was recommended and offered a sanitizing solution to be blown into the duct work. This solution is to help with allergies and overall air quality. This was $169, but was thrown in. The entire process was down within about 45 minutes. Vents are cleaner, allergy solution is..well sprayed. Hard to have an option as it is really an unseen benefit. They do offer a 1 year warranty on the spary and offered to re-apply/spray in a year for free.  Overall job cost was $250. Being the vents have probably never been done, and this is something you only do ever few years I felt the cost was appropriate.   Negative: Messy! Way more messy than anticipated. After the solution was sprayed we need to run the system for 2 additional hours. During this time, dust blew throughout the entire house. I know this as we had house cleaners who dusted everything less that 2  hours before and EVERYTHING was covered! The dust was so bad in the master bedroom that I actually put a towel over the vent to block it. Plus there was remained drywall/paint/stucco that had fallen off the vents when they were removed. There were also some wet spots where the allergy solution spray machine was sitting. Not a major deal, but a missed detail. This was less of a concern than the dust throughout the entire house.
