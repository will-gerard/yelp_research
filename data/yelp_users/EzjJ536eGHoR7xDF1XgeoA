I really like Carsten Salon, Ally in particular.  The desk staff have improved and are not any more snooty than at any other high-end salon.  It seems to go with the territory in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I had tried severl other salons over the last few years trying to save money (Great Recession) but really think Carsten is the best salon in Phoenix.  Really my loyalty is to Ally, she always gives me a perfect cut.  She is super nice and I've missed her.  If Ally left I would probably leave too, but for now I'm glad to be back.

My friend brought me to the Ranch Market to buy tamales for New Year's Eve.  That was four night ago.  I've been back five times since then.  I'm in love with this place. The food is amazing the prices are lower and there is so much atmosphere.  How can I ever go back to Safeway or Fry's.  If you have never been you should get in to your car and drive there right now.  Ranch Market is now on the list of place I am going to take out of town guests.  This is what Phoenix is all about.

I had one of the worst dining experiences recently at My Florist.  My boyfriend and I arrived for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  There were maybe four to five other tables in the restaurant.  We ordered the bruschetta and I ordered a salad while my boyfriend ordered the chicken salad sandwich.  Five minutes later the main dish comes out and there is no bruschetta...apparently the Waiter didn't think that it was important to serve the appetizer before the main course...details.  My boyfriend finished his sandwich.  I am a much slower eater so I was about half way through my salad.  As soon as he finished his last bite the waiter cleared the table and brought the check.  This is my pet peeve.  Everyone at the table should be allowed to finish their meal and the plates should not be cleared until the last person has finished their meal.  Not sure why we were being rushed out of the restaurant considering it was empty.    I feel like calling the owner on Monday and let him know that the staff are driving customers away.  What a terrible experience.

I don't get the appeal of Portland's the space is terribly designed, modern in a bad way.  My biggest problem is the food.  I ordered a  hamburger had a few bites and was done.  I could have sent it back, but I was having such a lousy time I decided it wasn't worth hanging around.  The funny thing is that a lot of people that I work with think Portland's is a great place...I had high expectations.  I won't be back.  There are much better options in the vicinity.

This is a great place.  My favorite meal is cheese pizza with a glass of red wine.  Pino's get's is perfect everytime.  If you haven't been you should give it a try.

Chelsea's Kitchen is among my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  The food is always good and I love the atmosphere on the patio.  The brussel sprout salad is a winner.  However, I am in love with the red velvet cake.

Love the Illy coffee. But I'm yelping today about the croissants. Pure heaven. Super flaky on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The antidote to the soggy, mushy croissants you find most other places.

I was in the restaurant last Friday. It was wonderful. This is among the best places I have eaten in Phoenix. I had the beef, almost a stew. It was very well prepared. My cousin raved about the gnocchi. My favorite thing about this place is the low key atmosphere. The wait staff is low key, attentive, but not overbearing. The house is charming and its a really comfortable place to sit and have a leisurely meal.   I would have given the restaurant five stars but I question how it can charge $48 for a bottle of Arizona wine. It was a pretty terrible bottle. I would have sent it back, but I wanted to give it a shot so ultimately it's my fault for not saying anything to the waiter. Our second bottle was a lovely California Pinot Noir.   If you haven't been to Quiessence add it to the top of your list.

My partner and I just moved downtown and The Roosevelt has become our hang-out. I love this place. The staff is so friendly, genuinely friendly. They are also knowledgeable about wine and we have had some amazing bottles. The food is also excellent. My favorite is the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It seems to draw a good mix of people so we don't always feel like the oldest people in the room. Great place to spend an evening.

I ate at Harley's for the first time last night.  The staff was wonderful, but the food was a complete dissapointment.  I ordered the special it was a pasta/chicken dish drowned in a gorgonzola mushroom sauce.  The sauce was far too rich and overpowered any other flavor in the dish.  I expected a lot from Harley's because it had been highly recommended by several people that I know.  I'm not giving up because the waiter was excellent so maybe it was just an off night.

Terrible experience here. First, I was stabbed in the gum with the sonic cleaner device when the dentist wedged it between my tooth and gum. I literally yelped in pain. Then the dentist spent the rest of the appointment telling me how much additional work I need (as if I am letting her anywhere near my mouth again) and surprise they already checked to see that my insurance will pay for it...I'm going back to my old Dentist.

I saw Damien's card on the bulletin board at my apartment building.  I was in bad need of a haircut so I stoped in.  First, the space is very well done.  Super fun and comfortable.  Appeals to my minimalist taste.  The shampooing chair is the most comfortable I have ever sat in.  I didn't feel like my neck was going to break.  Most important, I got a great haircut.  I came to Damien with a Great Clips mess and he saved the day.  I can walk around town with my head held high.  The price is on the high side but I'll be back!

I really like this place.  The staff is very friendly and it's a nice place to have a bite and a glass of wine.  I prefer it to Fez or Ticoz.

I am so sick of the bad attitude of employees of United Airlines.  I understand that you don't like your jobs, feel like you are underpaid...Doesn't everyone.  Why take it out on the passegers.  I was literrally glared at by the Gate Agent on a recent flight to Denver, when I asked for an aisle seat...I have been a loyal United customer since 1997.  I guess you can say I'm a slave to the Milleage Plus program.  United is certainly better than fellow Star Alliance member U.S. Airways.  I'm just sick of the employees.  I recently flew on Southwest (fluke) and it was a really good experience.  Maybe I should switch.  Too bad Southwest does not fly internationally.

I've been in several times.  Overall I think it is fairly mediocre.  We had a really good experience on our first visit.  We sat at the bar, the bar tender was super friendly and the service was great.  That first visit I had one of the pizza (Not sure about the shape) which I though was decent (I prefer a thinner crispier crust), but overall good.  Based on the first visit I would have granted Crust four stars.    Since our first visit it has gone downhill.  We live in the neighborhood so this could have been the perfect neighborhood hangout.  We brought my partner's mother and grandmother in on a Friday night (Memorial Day Weekend).  There was only one waitperson (but three busboys...)  The service was slow, the music was too loud, but the food was good.  I had the special which was delicious.  I would have given this visit three stars, knocking off another star for bad, slow service.  We have been in one additional time.  The service continues to go downhill.  We sat at the bar and it was all we could do to get the attention of the bartender to serve us anything.  We finally had the Penne alla Scottsdale.  It's a good dish.  However, I am knocking off the final star for continued service problems.  I don't think we will go back because we found a new Italian place up on Shea that we like a lot better.  It's further away, but the service is always good.    Overall, the food at Crust is good and it has a decent wine list, it's just a bummer to eat somewhere where the wait and bar staff are apathetic.

I love this store.  It has everything you need without being overwhelming.  Truly one stop shopping (Unlike Trader Joe's).  My one complaint is the self-checkout.  The system locks up when you buy a bottle of wine and then you have to hunt down a clerk to unlock the machine.  I don't like to be kept waiting...Need to work out a better system.

I've eaten here three times.  The first two times were outstanding.  The third time was not a charm.  The food was almost inedible.  Our first course was a dumpling dish that had so much wasabi in it that I was in physical pain trying to eat the dish.  The second course was an inedible fish dish.  I don't think the fish was fresh.  The waitress, to her credit, saw that we were not enjoying the food and took it away.  We asked for the check and finished our drinks...we didn't complain and were not going to make a scene.  This is when things got weird.  The chef (owner??) came out and insisted that his food was good.  To prove it he insisted that we sample some other dishes.  He brought some sort of fish stew that was inedible (again the fish wasn't fresh)...At that point we paid the check and snuck out of the restaurant before he could serve us any additional food.    I won't be back.  It is a shame because the first two times I ate at Sens the food was delicious.  However, the hallmark of a good restaurant is that the food is good every time.

What a disaster.  For an organic restaurant the staff had no clue...couldn't even answer simple questions about the ingredients.  I have never rejected a bottle of wine untile the waitress tried to serve us a corked bottle of wine...she seemed suprised that we would not accept the bottle...  If you want to eat in a real locally sourced/organic restaurant try Quiessence.

My partner and I moved in last week and so far we love it.  The views from our apartment are amazing and it is the best location in Phoenix.  We looked all over Central Phoenix and found that Alta has the best floorplans really smart space planning and lots of storage.  We have also been suprised at how friendly everyone is.  If you are looking in Central Phoenix give Alta a serious look.

I love this place as a bar.  The tiki decor is fun and I love that the whole building opens up.  Super fun space and the bar staff are great.  It satisfies me when I need a super fruity fru-fru drink.

We went in for the first time two Friday's ago and had the most amazing meal.  I had the port shoulder and asparagus.  It was delicious and spicy, just the way I like it.  It's a more modern take on the traditional thai menu that I appreciate.  We always sit at the bar because we like talking to the bartender.  She is really friendly and has lots of helpful tips about the menu.  I would have given the restaurant five stars, but I took one star away because we went in again last night and I was not impressed with the drunken beef entrée.  Kind of bland.  However, the indian bread and beef appetizer is delicious.  Overall this is our new favorite local hangout.

We have tried this place twice.  Our first visit was on our anniversary when we were served a bottle of the Emeritus Pinot warm.  The bar tender tried to remedy the situation by putting the bottle in a chiller.   Not a place for wine lovers like ourselves.  We came back last night and had a terrible experience.  We ordered the Emeritus Pinot again.  Fortunately it was properly served :). We orders the steak frites for dinner (my favorite) and were served a steak salad.  We sent the salads back .  I kid you not, the kitchen scraped the steak off, added some frites and served It to us cold.  Pathetic.  We sent it back.   The manager came out and offered  us free dessert, never mind that we hadn't eaten anything for dinner....We were not at Denny's (although I wish we were), a brownie doesn't make it all better...we paid for the wine, left and went to Humble Pie.   I don't think we will give this place a third try.

This is my favorite of the Sam Fax concepts.  North has been revamped and is now more rustic.  It's a huge, huge improvement over the old North.  I have been to the Kierland, 40th Street and Tucson locations.    The Good:  We love the location on 40th Street.  We usually go on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  We like to sit at the bar and the bar tenders are all super friendly.  We also like the wine special, don't know what that says about us.  There are so many good choices on the menu.  The pasta is all handmade.  The pizza's are excellent and they have a good selection of wines.  The Tucson location is beautiful and there is a great view from the patio.  The Bad:  For some reason some of my favorite items from the menu are not available at the Kierland location.  Also, the lasagne is not very good, I would avoid it.

Dear Catastrophe Waitress,  It's not okay to push people out I your way or sneer at your customers.   We can't help it that the airport is busy and that you are poorly managed.  You shouldn't take your anger out on the very people on who you depend for you livelihood.  It's too bad you blew us off.  We are nice people and good tippers.  Happy Thanksgiving.

I was in last Wednesday.  We had a delightful evening.  I was surprised at how good the food was.  Considering the location in a strip mall, I didn't have high expectations.  The service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive.  I ordered the scallop risotto.  I thought it was absolutely delicious.  The scallops were perfectly cook.  My husband ordered the pasta bolognese and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  My niece had the steak salad and it was also delicious.  The low point of the meal was desert, the beignets were a bit hard.  I prefer mine to be a bit more delicate.  Overall the experience was good and we will be back.

Federal Pizza is truly awesome.  I am a fan of the marguerita pizza, I like to keep it simple when it comes to pizza.  The tomatoes are so fresh, it really blew me away.  Everyone at the table loved their food.  I've been in three times and each time Federal Pizza blows me away.  The staff is supper friendly.  One more recommendation, the doughnuts are fresh, soft and fluffy.  Not to be missed.

Fun little place to grab a drink during a shopping break.  Welcome addition to the Biltmore.  The bartender was friendly, it has the intimate feel which is a nice balance to the cavernous Phoenix restaurants.  I haven't sampled the food, but was impressed by the wine list.  We were there on a rainy day, but can't wait to go back when we can sit outside.

Sam Fox is brilliant at marketing. Service and food not so much.  We had a reservation but we were not seated on time.  They were out of shrimp cocktail and lobster rolls.  The pot of crab is really a pot of butter.  The kale salad is good.  The halibut was delicious.  The beignets are too dense.  The staff didn't know what type of fish was in the fish and chips or the difference between east and west coast oysters.   It's expensive for what you get.  Paper napkins at this price point????

I'm in love, seriously.  I had the best breakfast in years.  It was really simple, just eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast but all the ingredients were fresh and it really hit the spot.  My partner ordered the frittata, which was also excellent.  It was too hot to sit outside.  I can't wait until the weather cools down so that we can sit on the patio.  I think we may even be able to bring our dog on the patio...I am so happy that more good restaurants are opening in Central Phoenix.  Living down here gets better and better.

I am so happy that The Clever Koi is open. It gives me hope that smart inventive people will start colonizing Central Phoenix.  The Clever Koi has a laid back, unpretentious vibe.  It's a great place to hang out after work.  Overall I had an excellent experience.  First they have a great selection of wines that you don't typically see other places.  I'm not sure if they are connected to the wine bar next door, but I appreciate that there was something different to choose from.  We ordered a selection of dishes.  The low point was the Wood Fired Grill Plate which was just so/so.  Everything else was delicious, particularly the corn dogs.   We live a block away so I am sure that we will become regulars.

This is the best food in Phoenix!  I was in on Saturday night.  I had the five course tasting menu.  First course was the ahi chopped salad.  It was so fresh and the aroma was incredible.  I could smell all the ingredients.  Second course was the clam chowder.   Amazing.  The crab was fresh and the chowder was creamy.  Third course was the snapper.  The skin was perfectly crispy.  Fourth course was the chicken tandoori.  Every bite was a flavor explosion. Last course was the pineapple cake.  Not great but okay.  The cake was dry and the flavor combo didn't work for me.  Overall this was the best food experience I have had in Phoenix.  I'll be back again when the menu changes.  So happy to see a young creative chef succeeding!

I have a feeling that Southern Rail is not going to make it.  The service is just so/so, it may be because they are new and working out the kinks, but we didn't particularly feel welcomed.  Everyone seemed kind of frenzied.  I do love the atmosphere, it's very open and fresh looking.  I also like that they kept the booths from Beefeaters, something new something old...  We lived in Atlanta so we have high standards when it comes to southern cooking. The ribs were a standout.  They were tender and the meat fell off the bone.  The gumbo was also excellent.    Unfortunately, just about everything else we ordered was not good.  Let me start with the biscuits which were hard as rocks.  Biscuits should be light and fluffy....  The fried green tomatoes were too firm, not sweet the way they are down south.  The corn bread was dry...the biggest   One of the biggest food disappointments of the night was the coconut cake it was so dry it was hard to eat.  It is a major fail.  I wanted to like Southern Rail but I am not a fan.  I give it two stars for atmosphere and the excellent ribs.
