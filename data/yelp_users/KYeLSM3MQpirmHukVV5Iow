Honey Bear's is a place that was at one point a celebrated BBQ establishment, but it is now only a shell of its supposed former greatness.  The setup and quality are fast food, but the prices are a notch higher.  The meat tastes alright, but nothing special.  The restaurant itself is a bit of a dive (although the Central Ave. location is nicer, it is considerably more crowded).  The portions are meager.  All of this leaves you with the feeling that it would be a good $5 lunch.  Unfortunately, it's not just $5.

Went here for lunch one day because the excellent Asian Seafood Buffet next door closed (bummer!).  We figured, why not try a more traditional Chinese place?  It seemed like it would be good... The menu looked alright, like a typical small Chinese restaurant.  I ordered the General Tso's.  I have to say, it was terrible.  The breading was all wrong, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was an abomination.  Where was the soy sauce?  The ginger?  I submit to you that they simply took sweet and sour sauce, mixed in some hot pepper paste, and called it General Tso's.  I have made General Tso's several times, and nothing about this was even close.  The rest of the dish was forgettable... Just your typical white rice and water.  I'm sure this place has some good dishes, but I clearly didn't order one of them.

First things first: Saba's does not have the best Mediterranean food in Phoenix. There are just some really awesome Lebanese places in Tempe and elsewhere around the valley, and as I discovered yesterday, we even have some excellent Moroccan food. But Saba's is very, very good. Possibly the best in the Paradise Valley-ish area.  Another thing: if you don't like Saba's because you've had better gyros, or you found your pita sandwich too lackluster, you are an idiot. Not because their sandwiches are good - I don't know if they are, because YOU DON'T GO TO A QUALITY MEDITERRANEAN PLACE TO GET A PITA SANDWICH. There, I said it.  The only places you judge solely based on pita sandwiches are places that primarily serve pita sandwiches.  No, at Saba's, it's the entrees that shine. The lamb kafta, the lamb shank, you know... actual entrees. Their baba gannouj is excellent; I get that every time.  To round out your sides, the grilled veggies are a great choice.  They also have fries with feta cheese and seasonings, but I didn't like those as much.  The mango juice is also a must.  So, to reiterate, Saba's is very, very good - so long as you don't get the same thing that you can get at every dime-a-dozen Mediterranean fast-food place on earth. The best? No, but it owns the neighborhood, as far as this genre is concerned.

I stopped in here for lunch, and I have to say, I don't know what the fuss is about.  First of all, it's fast food, so to say this is better than Famous Dave's or  Joe's is a little absurd.  It is a fast food restaurant, and the food is fast food quality.  Some of the other reviews unfortunately led me to believe this would be on a par with some of the other great BBQ joints around.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, with mashed potatoes and garlic toast on the side.  The sandwich itself was fine, although as one other reviewer mentioned, it was a little bland.  The meat was also not piled particularly high, as evidenced by its failure to fall out of the sandwich and onto the foil wrapper.  The garlic toast was not really garlic toast.  It was more like a toasted sandwich bun with butter and a little bit of garlic salt.  There was not fresh garlic on it, nor did it even taste like garlic.  Very disappointing.  The mashed potatoes were even worse.  I ate less than half; there was no flavor (maybe throw a little garlic in there?), and the texture was more pasty than soft and fluffy.  After the first bite, I took a few more out of obligation, and set it aside.  I did like to see the lamb on the menu.  I will definitely be back to give it a try.  But the most spectacular part of my meal was the bottled root beer, and that should never happen when you go to eat BBQ.  It seems like they just generally have an inexplicable fear of garlic.  Maybe they're vampires?  2.5 stars.  At least it's better than Honey Bear's.

Since my previous review last year, I've eaten at Haps quite a few more times.  After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.  Why?  Well, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled "frozen dairy dessert product."  And perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.  For the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.  I guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food.

One of my coworkers came up with the idea of paying this place a visit for lunch--and it turned out to be one of my more memorable lunches in at least the last week.  There is much that is unique about this place, enough to guarantee that you will never forget it.  The first characteristic that struck me as interesting or different was its curious location in what appears to be a typical office building.  It's not in a shopping center, or standalone building--it's in an office building.  This alone isn't enough to set it apart from other sub shops, however.  Even more curious is that distinct smell that hits you when you first walk in.  I'm not sure if it's old meat, or asbestos, or what, but the procurators of this wonderful place have come up with the brilliant idea of deviating from such typical sandwich shop smells as freshly chopped lettuce or garlic or what have you.  If they're not already different enough, they decided to make an incredibly daring move--don't put the sandwich menu up on the wall, but instead keep it to a single sheet of paper.  Why did they do this?  Possibly because the menu has somewhere on the order of 50 or 60 different choices of sandwiches--for example, the #40, "Hot Pastrami, melted Swiss, sauerkraut, and thousand island dressing" (which most of us simply refer to as the "Reuben"), and the #41, "Hot Pastrami, melted Swiss, and thousand island dressing."  Yes, they felt it necessary to make each available permutation of each basic sandwich a separate menu item.  This is great because you can then make it a highly-entertaining game of finding your sandwich!  It's like an adventure in itself!  The next interesting part about a meal at Luv-A-Sub is the food itself (amazingly enough, there is nothing all that distinct about the payment process!).  I ordered the #30, "Roast Beef, Prosciutto, Swiss Cheese, Bell Peppers, and Mushrooms."  My first observation when trying to pick up this sandwich is that the sandwich was incredibly hot, but the bread still managed to be decidedly non-crispy.  Interesting!  Even more crazy, however, is that the mushrooms--which certainly had the appearance of having been cooked--were still cold!  How did they do that!  Between the obviously-canned mushrooms and high-in-sodium roast beef, it certainly was a distinct sandwich, with a taste the likes of which I had never experienced up till now.  The last odd curiousity we noticed--which absolutely cements Luv-A-Sub's position as the most unique sandwich shop in the US--is the drink pricing system.  One of my coworkers--who wasn't as wise as I in getting his drink without ice, and as a result ended up getting mostly ice--decided to ask for a refill.  They were more than willing to oblige, provided he pay them $.25.  They charge for refills--fair enough--so he decided to ask for a cup of water instead.  He found that--wait for it--a cup of water costs $.25!  Amazing!  What an incredibly interesting and novel idea on their part.  Now they'll almost guarantee that they don't get repeat business!  So, if what you want is an exciting, interesting experience with an ambience unlike anything you've seen, by all means, try this place out.  But it's not for everybody--if you're one of those narrow-minded people who like a boring clean-smelling place with *typical* fresh-tasting food, it's probably not for you.

Raven @ South Mountain is great.  Obviously, the most unique thing about this course is the distinct non-Arizona vegetation, which really takes you out of the surroundings.  It's definitely one of the most beautiful courses in the Phoenix area.  It also has its fair share of interesting holes.  Water is rare, but comes into play a couple of times on the front nine, as well as on the 18th hole.  There are a few greens that are very well protected, so make sure your bunker game is in working order.  That said, it is quite pricey, with a summer morning round costing over $50.  For $50, there are better courses to play in Phoenix.  Also, it seems a lot of the people who play here think they are hot shots.  Maybe it's because they can afford to spend $50 in the summer on a less-than-perfect course.

For a municipal course, Dobson Ranch is tops.  This is the place to go for a good, cheap afternoon round of golf during the summer.  It's a well maintained traditional course, with large trees lining the fairways, and grass everywhere.  Dobson Ranch is great for beginners, as the ball is playable from anywhere that is not in someone's backyard.  It's slice-friendly too, with most of the out of bounds areas sitting to the left of the fairways.  Dobson Ranch is a standard par 72, except instead of having 4 par 3s, 10 par 4s, and 4 par 5s; it has 5 par 3s, 8 par 4s, and 5 par 5s.  At only $10 to walk on a summer afternoon, this is one of the best values in the Valley.

When I get a sweet tooth and decide I want something ice cream-like, this is near the top of my list.  Frozen custard is a notch above ice cream and frozen yogurt, in my opinion.  The great thing about Nielsen's is the mix ins.  My favorite is butterscotch.  Pumpkin and Cap'n Crunch are also great.  Heck, just thinking about it makes me want to go get some.  The only thing I don't like about this place is the non-dessert options.  I don't really care for their regular food.

Superstition Springs is good, but not great.  Grass is plentiful here, so it's not a desert course by any means.  There are plenty of water hazards to go around, so bring lots of balls.  The course was really in pretty good shape.  I like the layout.  There are a few minor elevation changes, and some opportunities to carry (or lose your ball, in my case) over water.  There is even a running creek between holes 10 and 18 that is sure to leap up and grab your ball.  On two holes, there is water on either side of the fairway, so straight shots are generally rewarded at S.S.  The only problem is the price.  Superstition Springs is almost always overpriced, running at over $100 in the winter, and $40-$50 (if you include range balls) in the summer.  For that price, you might as well play a much nicer course like Las Sendas five miles up the road.  It might be good for an afternoon twilight round during the summer, but at their normal rates, it's not a good value.

This is easily the worst golf course I have ever played.  There are several problems with it:  First of all, it's a desert course.  Not that there's anything wrong with desert courses, but on some holes, the fairway does not start until 150-200 yards off the tee.  That's fine on most courses, but on this one, if you don't hit the fairway, it'll be nothing but dirt and rocks.  No rough or anything.  On most long holes, if you mess up the tee shot, your hole is blown.  Second, the layout is dangerous, especially on the back nine.  There is one spot where three holes more or less converge, and you are right in the path of errant shots from not one or two, but three holes.  You have to keep your eyes open or you can get nailed.  Third, there is no enforcement of pace whatsoever.  We played there during the summer, and there was a line at the tee for most of the front nine.  In all, the game took 5 1/2 hours to play, which is ridiculous.  Finally, very few holes have yardage markers.  Combine this with no GPS, and it makes club selection very difficult, if not impossible.  It's tough to get an accurate measurement by eying it or using the scorecard.  The only redeeming part of this course is an island green on the sixth hole, although I should note that it appears as if nobody bothers to repair ball marks there.

The sushi quest continues.  And we decided to check out one of the more promising places in the East Valley.  So we rolled into Shimogamo, a small place next to C-Fu Gourmet and across the street from Lee Lee Market.  With neighbors this Asian, they have to be legit, right?  The first thing I noticed was a nice list of fish and roll options, but a limited set of specials.  That's fine, maybe we can see if there's anything they're not telling us about... Or ask the chef to make us something interesting.  We started with the beef carpaccio.  Carpaccio is typically thinly sliced meat, served raw with some marinade, scallions, and other garnishes.  This one was supposed to be seared, but it came out medium.  It was pretty good, but could have been much better if it were actually served rare.  Next, we had something we asked the chef to surprise us with.  Disappointingly, the chef didn't come over and tell us what he made, and the waitress didn't seem to know.  But it involved a tempura-fried whitefish on a bed of Japanese veggies and a tough of tobiko.  It was good, but we were definitely hoping for something a little more interesting.  Probably the least memorable surprise we've had from a sushi chef yet.  Next, we had albacore and escolar sushi.  They were both good, and came garnished, so I didn't add any soy sauce to those... And they were conveniently on the happy hour menu.  Bonus!  We had a spider roll afterwards, and while I'm not usually a fan of rolls, I always like a good soft-shelled crab.  This one was better than some of the others I've had, on account of the fact that it also had avocado.   The waitress then brought us our shrimp sashimi (with the fried shrimp heads - make sure you ask for that if you order the fresh shrimp!).  These shrimp were huge, and fresh.  Plus, as an added bonus, the heads came stuffed to the brim with "goodies."  I'm not exactly sure what the goodies are, but they have a distinct flavor, and I suspect it is a mix of central nervous system and the free-form liver/pancreatic capabilities that most crustaceans are endowed with.  We had the tuna poke, which seems to be Shimogamo's signature dish.  It tastes great, but it is quite basic.  Basically just tuna and avocado topped with a lightly fried quail egg.  This is one of those times when "less is more" is true.  After this, we had another item on the specials board, the orange yellowtail.  This is yellowtail sashimi marinaded with citrus flavor, served with sliced avocado and a touch of sriracha.  This was actually pretty delicious.  Finally, we finished with salmon roe and scallop nigiri, and quail eggs.  The salmon roe was some of the best I've had in awhile (they didn't have that fishy flavor that you sometimes get at a place with limited quality control).  Unfortunately, a few of the things we wanted to order were not available.  They didn't have any uni, baby yellowtail, or toro, which was really quite a bummer.  The owner explained to us that the market price is simply too high right now for him to be able to avoid throwing a bunch out, so I appreciate his willingness to only serve what he can guarantee to be fresh.  Some of this is the fault of their clientele, who from what I could tell, is very caucasian, and might not be interested in paying top dollar for a great cut of fish.    My final verdict on Shimogamo is that it's good, but a clear step below the best sushi places I've been to.  Everything was fresh, and the dishes were well-executed.  Furthermore, the prices were reasonable.  All of these make it a very respectable location, and potentially the best in the East Valley (we'll have to try the competition, of course).    Where they fall short is in two areas: first, the menu (and it seems the chefs) lack creativity.  They do a limited set of dishes well, but they don't seem to be food artists.  It's a little too generic.  Second, the waitress didn't seem very knowledgeable about some of the menu items, and had to ask the chef about a few things.  If she is relatively new, I could give her a pass.  Shimogamo may compete for the "best in East Valley" subcategory, but it can't quite hang in the top tier.

In how many different ways can you arrange the same ten ingredients?  If this were a contest, Temari would win, hands down.  This looked like one of the most promising places in a very generic East Valley sushi scene, so we decided to give it a shot.  When I sat down, our eager waiter asked me what I'd like to drink.  I asked him if they only have fountain sodas, and he looked at me like I was speaking Greek.  I said, "What do you have, bottles?"  He said they don't have cans or anything; it just comes out of a gun.  So... Fountain sodas then.  Got it.  My friend said his Mr. Pibb tasted off, and asked to switch to Coke.  He said sure, but he'll have to pay for the Coke.  Now, on to the food.... I looked at the menu.  I saw about three pages of rolls.  I looked at the specials board.  More rolls.  Looked at the regular menu.... Standard Japanese fare.  They have teriyaki.  TERIYAKI!  Who eats teriyaki?  This isn't Samurai Sam's, is it?  They have some sashimi.  All very standard cuts of fish.  Tuna, white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass, and mackerel is probably all they had.  Maybe the weakest selection I've seen, well, anywhere.  The nigiri sushi (which I'm pretty sure I heard our waiter pronounce as "NIGH gi ri" sushi to the diners at the next table) was pretty standard as well.  Ra has better selection.  Yes, that's right, Ra, one of the most notoriously generic sushi restaurants in the world, has a better selection of fish than Temari!  Anyways, at about six different points while I was looking through the tome they call a "specials menu" (which consists of about 99.5% rolls, plus tuna poke), our eager waiter asked us if we know what we would like yet.  Sorry, bro, can't you see I'm reading here!  I'm like half way through!  My eyes are getting tired from reading the words "spicy tuna," "eel sauce," and "chili sauce" so much!  Because 75% of the rolls have one of more of those ingredients!  It was amazing how many different rolls they had, yet how few of them actually sounded appealing.  Most of them seemed to be more focused on sauces and spice than actual fish flavor.  It's like people who eat sushi in Gilbert don't want to taste the awful flavor of fish!  Gross, right!  Fish, ugh!  I pointed out to my friend that one particular roll "has like three sauces: chili sauce, eel sauce, garlic citrus sauce, and kiwi sauce. Four sauces!" (imagine the Spanish Inquisition.)  Anyways, about our actual order: we went with the "chef's choice" sashimi platter, a romantic roll (cucumber with a bunch of stuff inside), a sunkist roll (some fish completely drowned in citrus flavor), and amaebi and quail egg sushi.  I think "chef's choice" means "cheapest," because no real sushi chef would put both tuna and salmon on his own plate if he were picking what he wanted to eat.  The sashimi itself was OK I guess.  The rolls were very boring, as we expected.  The sweet shrimp was good, but you can tell what type of clientele they have when they placed the heads on our table, and the diners at the next table over seemed awestruck by the fact that someone would actually eat a shrimp head, what with those cute little eyeballs staring at them.  This brings me to the conclusion of this review: this place utterly destroyed our hope of finding a good sushi bar in the East Valley.  Shimogamo was respectable, but even there, the owner was unable to keep the best cuts of fish in stock because he had no confidence his clientele would buy enough of it to keep it fresh.  This is the East Valley.  People think sushi is a bunch of rolls.  You ask an East Valley denizen about their favorite sushi place, and they say, "I like this place, they have great rolls!"  Only here can a sushi bar stock just seven cuts of fish, and just offer 500 rolls with the same ten ingredients, and maybe serve some teriyaki chicken for those who REALLY hate sushi, and be successful.  I think we're going to look for the East Valley sushi bar with the lowest yelp rating, because that one is probably the best.  At least they didn't end up charging us for that extra Coke.  Addendum: I was just reminded about the fortune cookie they served with dessert.  A fortune cookie!  At a Japanese Restaurant!  On the back of the fortune it said "Learn Chinese."  Not making this up.

After eating at Joe's Real BBQ about a gazillion times, I finally decided I ought to give Liberty Market a chance.  I remember growing up in Gilbert and always passing by this building in the historic part of town; back then it was actually a market.  The first thing I noticed is the interesting variety of options on the menu.  They have Mr. Pibb-marinated steak, burgers, pizza, sicilian pizza, salads, and even a chef's special paella with mussels, shrimp, scallops, chorrizo, a variety of dessert options, and more.  It was difficult to decide, to say the least.  I opted to have the white pizza and bread pudding.  The pizza was one of the most delicious I've had.  It was an amazing pizza.  So good that I'll have a difficult time trying something else next time I go there.  The bread pudding was bland.  The whipped cream was good, but the bread pudding itself was pretty flavorless.  The biggest gripe I have with this place is that it's a cafeteria style setup, but the prices are more in line with a sit down restaurant.  The service is pretty good, though.  It'll still be difficult to eat here with Joe's Real BBQ across the street, but I'll probably add it to my rotation.

This week, we decided to venture up to Scottsdale for our sushi fix, and despite a name that would seem to belong at a large outdoor corporate shopping center, Sushi on Shea had a promising menu.  We walked in early in the evening, and the place was virtually empty.  Sitting at the bar, we started with the miso soup with clams.  This was actually superior to the same dish at Yasu; the soup was less briny, and the clams were a little more plump and flavorful.  I knew at that point that this would probably be a good meal.  The first items we ate were the live jumbo clam and the kai snapper sushi from the specials menu.  Let me tell you - the clam was one of the freshest, most delectable seafood items I've ever eaten.  The owner recommended we eat it straight, without soy sauce - its flavor is so delicate and so perfect that you don't need to soil it with something else.  The kai snapper was also tasty; it was seared, with a bit of skin to give it a strong, unique flavor that you don't normally get from nigiri.  After the clam, we were served a half dozen oysters, which were topped with ponzu sauce (made in-house).  The oysters were good, but I felt like the sauce was a bit too overpowering.  I'd have cut the sauce in half.  Usually when I eat oysters, I only lightly drizzle them with mignonette, because I love the flavor of those scrumptious little bivalves.  Next, we had the yellowtail collar off the specials menu (I forgot what it's called, but the owner explained that it is prepared with garlic and ginger, and that her restaurant is the only place you can get it prepared that way).  It was absolutely delicious.  I'm not normally a fan of cooked fish, but this was probably the best cooked fish I have ever tasted.  It was fall-off-the-bone tender, rich in flavor, and the Japanese eggplant soaking in the soup was just delicious (and I don't even like eggplant).  While showing off her fresh uni (not as fresh as the just-killed-it-and-scooped-it-out uni I've had in California and Portland, but still fresh), she suggested trying it with squid and quail egg.  So we did, and it was delicious.  (As a side note, she did say that she gets live sea urchin from time to time; she had been expecting it to arrive with the live clam, but it didn't.  If you time it right, you might be able to get live sea urchin here.)  After the uni, squid, and quail egg sushi, we had our main sushi and sashimi platter.  We went with king salmon sushi, aji sushi, and blue fin toro sashimi (all from the specials menu).  Yes, king salmon tastes different, and better, than your run-of-the-mill salmon.  And blue fin toro tastes different, and stronger, than normal tuna.  At this point, we decided we were not quite finished.  We ordered the tuna carpaccio and the yellowtail citrus roll (which was on the specials menu).  The carpaccio was my friend's favorite item; it is tuna topped with creamy horseradish mayo and wasabi and black tobaiko.  I'm not sure exactly what was in the yellowtail citrus roll, but it had yellowtail on the outside, and something cooked and flavored with a chipotle seasoning on the inside.  It was spicy with a hint of citrus.  My verdict on this place is that it is an extremely good sushi bar, with plenty of interesting cuts of fish that you don't see at the generic places outside of Scottsdale.  It is also not trendy sushi, and everything is nice and fresh.  Sushi On Shea has to be considered one of the best sushi bars in Phoenix; I'm not sure if I enjoyed the overall dining experience better than the excellent meal we had at Yasu, but this seems to be better place to get traditional sushi and less common fish.  A final note: the owner said they do omakase meals.  I didn't inquire about the price, but I will most definitely be back eventually, just to see how they do with that.

This week, our sushi quest brought us to Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  After last week's debacle, we wanted something that seemed like a more sure bet.  We started with the miso soup, and then ordered pretty much everything that seemed new and/or tasty.  The first dish that was served was our sashimi, which included uni (not the best I've had, but I'm spoiled after having had live sea urchin), toro (this was delicious), and Spanish mackerel (with deep fried bones!).  I am a mackerel fan, and the bones were even better.  I thought about asking if they had any extra Spanish mackerel bones lying around.  Next, we had the ankimo, which was pretty good.  I've had better ankimo, but it was far superior to the ankimo we had at Hana Japanese Eatery over a month ago.  After the ankimo, they brought the dynamite appetizer.  This was a baked scallop, mushroom, and cream dish that was pretty delicious, and a definite hit at our table (though it was inferior to the dynamite I had over a week earlier, which had geoduck in addition to scallops).  We then had the sushi: sea snail, edge of halibut, escolar, and jellyfish.  The halibut was garnished with too much wasabi for my taste, the sea snail was lightly flavored and crunchy, and the escolar was amazing.  (One of my friends pointed out this morning that escolar can cause diarrhea that is orange and oily, and I said, "So, basically like my diarrhea this morning."  I contend that it was worth it.)  The jellyfish was a first for me; it was crunchy with a bit of a spicy flavor (not sure if they seasoned it, or if this is naturally the way jellyfish tastes).  At this point, we decided that we wanted a little more, so we ordered grilled shishitou peppers and salmon roe.  The salmon roe was not the best I have had, but the peppers were pretty tasty (not as good as the ones they have at Roka Akor, however).  Out of curiosity, I asked the waitress if they had any kama, which I did not see on the menu.  She said they had hamachi and salmon kama, which was only $8, so we sprung for the hamachi.  It was tasty and tender, but not as fall-off-the-bone tender or mouth-wateringly delicious as the hamachi kama we had at Sushi on Shea.  Finally, we had the tempura ice cream, which was the best tempura ice cream I have found in Phoenix.  Overall, Hiro seems like a very good sushi bar.  The food is fresh, they have some good special items, and it is actually very reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, it will be hard to go back here with Sushi on Shea being only a few miles down the road.

Eagle Mountain is awesome.  It's playable, and at the same time offers some unique challenges.  Not as difficult as some of the other courses in the area, but it's just as fun.    The best thing about Eagle Mountain is the elevation changes on almost every hole.  You're hitting uphill, or you're hitting downhill... Keeps it interesting.  The condition wasn't excellent, but that's expected for a few weeks before overseeding.  The staff is very helpful and friendly... They even dropped off some cold mango towels, which is unusual for a non-resort course.  They definitely take care of you here.  If you live in AZ, make sure you book it through their website at the resident rate.  Save a few bucks that way.

This is a good course with great scenery.  All of the holes are interesting, so you'll leave with a memorable experience.  It is definitely challenging, especially if you haven't played it before.  A little course knowledge would have been very useful out there.  The staff was also very helpful and friendly.  Practice facilities were adequate.  The greens were rolling very fast, which I liked.    The only complaint I had about the place is that the fairways really weren't in great shape for a $50 course.  There were enough dead patches to force you to hit off of bare ground every now and then.  The 16th green was also in very bad shape.  The layout was great, but the course really should've been in better condition (although they did have some sprinklers attacking some of the dead areas, so maybe they're working on it).

Sorry folks, but this place is terrible.  I had heard my friends raving about it for awhile, but finally had the, uh, "opportunity" to try it out myself.  When I first walked in, I noticed it was just $9 for a big bowl, far cheaper than what I'm used to paying at Genghis Grill.  Sounds good, right?  Well, when I got to the food selections, I noticed a few things.  First, the meat was frozen. Second, there are only four meat options (frozen chicken, frozen beef, frozen turkey, and frozen pork).  Third, the vegetable selection is limited.  You'll have your lettuce, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, and bean sprouts, but there's not much more.  No eggs, baby corn, or anything else that might be interesting.  Oh, and no dry seasonings.  The sauces were encouraging.  I liked the idea of mixing and matching the different components.  After I tasted my food, however, backtracked on the sauce.  My bowl was quite soupy, but very bland.  The sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever.  Now I know why they provide that hot mustard... You need it if you want to actually taste something.  The portions were great, but I didn't even finish mine because it was just a bland, soupy mess of frozen garbage.  I think I'll spend the few extra bucks on Genghis.

This is, hands down, the best NY-style slice I've had in Arizona.  It's big, greasy, and tasty.  They lose a star only because it's not quite there with NY's best, and it has been a little inconsistent in the past, although I haven't had much of a problem with that lately.    Great value if you want a lunch close to $5.  Even a college student will find this place affordable.  Their wings are also delicious, and I have lately found myself gravitating towards a slice and wings instead of two slices.  Also, if you found this place cramped before, you should know that they recently remodeled.  What was previously the entire restaurant is now the kitchen, and the dining room is more than twice the size the restaurant used to be.

I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but when I want a hot dog, this is where I get a hot dog.  The all beef hot dog is to die for.    It won't fill you up, unless you spend over $10, but it is a good, satisfying meal.  The toppings are great--they have everything.  Ketchup, mustard, deli mustard, relish, spicy relish, chopped onions, peppers and onions, tomatoes, sauerkraut.... Did I forget any?  Fries are good, and the onion rings are alright (although they are closer to an onion brick).    Also, they do accept credit cards now.

This course has a good layout.  It starts off pretty easy... Really, it's all pretty easy, until you get to the last four holes.  The biggest challenge on the course is that many of the holes have washes across the fairways, and it didn't matter if the wash was 100 yards away or 200 yards, either way, my ball went in the wash.  The views are good, and the north half of the course is in the desert, with no surrounding homes.  The only problem was it really wasn't in excellent condition for a Troon course.  Other Troon courses I've played were far more immaculate.  Really not a bad course for the price, though.

This place sucks.  If you're going to pay over 10 bucks for a meal consisting of a sandwich, fries, and a drink, it better have actual table service.  This place is a cafeteria style establishment which serves inferior versions of all your favorite deli sandwiches.  I've eaten at this place for lack of alternatives within walking distance of where I worked, but eventually decided that as far as overpriced sandwiches are concerned, Duck and Decanter across the street is a notch above this.

After our first choice for Pizza turned out to be unfortunately very closed, we decided to head up the street to give this place a shot.  Possibly because it is located a couple miles down the street, this place always seems to be mentioned along with Pizza A Metro, so obviously I was more than willing to give Pino's a shot.  What unfolded was a very average experience.  None of the pies looked particularly interesting; I went with the vegetarian.  It was basically a step above a Barro's supreme pizza as far as toppings are concerned.  The crust was better than what you would get at a pizza chain, but it was a little harder than it should be, and somewhat lacking in flavor.  Nothing seems particularly bad, just underwhelming.  Not to mention, it cost almost $20 for a pizza and a drink.  A little steep for that neighborhood, I think.  It's really difficult to justify ever going back here when Pizza A Metro is just down the street.

Do not go here for food.  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the pizza here.  It might actually be worse than Little Caesar's or Peter Piper.  The ambiance doesn't redeem the place, either... Unless your favorite aura when you dine out is "divey."  I'd suggest you just skip the bad pizza and bad ambiance altogether and just hang out in the parking lot... But this is near one of Mesa's several nexi of ghetto.  Don't even hang out in the parking lot.  Why two stars?  Because the people who run the place are nice.  In a world of rampant narcissism and superficiality, being nice should count for something.  I'd suggest that your best bet is to walk in, chat with the proprietors for a few minutes, hand them $5 or so for a bottled Mexican soda just to show appreciation, and leave.  Don't eat the pizza, or hang out.  My suggestion to the owners as to how to improve the pizza: all it needs is better crust, better sauce, and maybe better cheese.  Really, that's not too much to change, right?

Get George's Special with giardiniera, and grab a Bundeburg Ginger Beer.  I know this review was terse, but if you haven't been here before, this is all the information you need.

Moroccan food in Phoenix? What? How had I been working a mile down the street for a year and a half without trying this place?  Well, I finally stopped by. It's a little confusing when you walk in, because it's really a small operation... Didn't know whether to just pick a table, or let the lady working there seat me, or what. But once I got situated, things started getting a little more relaxed.  The menu is impressive indeed, with a good six or seven dishes that were all calling my name. I ended up opting for the lamb tangine with soup and rice, and the lemonade. The lemonade is as good as any delicious lemonade you'll find at a Mediterranean place, by which I mean it actually tastes kinda like lemon.  I like that they make it a little tart - the same way they do it at my favorite Lebanese places.  The soup was a tomato based soup with carrots, chickpeas, lentils, spices, and possibly some other things. It's OK, I'm not a huge fan of that kind of soup, but it went down nicely, even on a 110 degree day.  Of course the tangine was what I was looking forward to most - the only way I can describe it is succulent. The lamb is fall-off-the-bone tender, and presumably cooked in the clay pot after which it is named, along with some figs and an aromatic sauce.   To complete the meal, I had some baklava for dessert. I figured I might as well try it, since I hadn't had baklava in awhile. It was delicious. It was drizzled in a light syrup, and wasn't quite as overwhelmingly rich as baklava can be sometimes.   This is definitely a place where you can expect to relax - it's a small operation. But just savor it, you're in Morocco!

Riverview is an excellent practice course.  Out of all the 9 hole courses I've played, this is the one I keep coming back to.  It's a traditional course, with well-maintained grass covering the entire property, and there are enough hills and bunkers to make it interesting, but simple.  The prices are fair, at just $8 for an afternoon walking round during the summer (and I think $15 during the winter).  One thing that always strikes me is how good the condition is.  The fairways are always green, and I have played non-municipal courses that were in MUCH worse shape.    Just beware of the imposing first and third tee shots, where a bad hook can ruin the day for some poor driver on 8th Street.

I recently had the opportunity to play here as a guest.  It was a good experience.  The first thing I noticed is the practice facilities, of course.  The driving range was nice, with some nice firm grass to hit from.  Nothing worse than going to a driving range and hitting from bare ground.  The course itself is traditional, with large trees lining the fairways, and reasonably distributed hazards.  Everything was in great condition; dead patches were rare.  Best of all, the greens were smooth and fast.  The most interesting thing about this course is its location right on the edge of Mesa's eponymous geographic feature.  There are a few elevated tees, one hole with a steep decline 200 yards off the tee, and a few holes where you are hitting up a steep incline to the green.  The facilities seemed nice, and the staff and members seemed friendly enough.  Just be careful getting in and out of the parking lot; several holes have you hitting over the road.

Barro's is great.  If you're looking for some standard takeout pizza, this is the place.  Great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  And you might as well ignore that reviewer who gave this restaurant two stars because it's not better than something that is not the same thing at all.  Well, no pizza is good as caviar, so I guess all pizza places should be three stars or lower...

We were looking for a late spring round of golf, and decided on Las Sendas, after hearing great things about the place.  The first thing I noticed was that the $60 rate includes range balls, which is something that I'm not used to.  Superstition Springs had a comparable tee time with a rate of $50, but when you add in up to $10 for range balls, the two courses are comparably priced.  It leaves a great first impression when you show up, pay the advertised rate, and don't get nickle-and-dimed just for warming up.  The second good impression came when I got a call from one of the guys in my group, who was running late because of an unexpected freeway closure.  I mentioned this to the starter, who was more than happy to accommodate us.  The staff was very friendly in general, and they almost seemed like they liked having us there, in contrast to some of those courses where they herd you around like cattle.  The actual course was excellent.  There were plenty of interesting holes, the layout was challenging, and the setting felt pastoral.  Some courses, Kokopelli for example, have houses so close to the fairway that any slightly errant ball has a good chance of getting lost or hitting a house.  At Las Sendas, there are houses, but they left the fairways wide enough that it felt wide open, and in most cases, even left a desert buffer between the houses and the fairways.  And perhaps best of all, this course offers some of the best scenery I've seen at a golf course in Phoenix.  The 18th tee box, among others, offers a sweeping view of the Phoenix area; constantly throughout the day, I was cursing myself for not having brought my camera.  After a very enjoyable 18, we ate lunch at the clubhouse, and decided we wanted to play more.  They got us back out at a very reasonable $20 replay rate.  Now I'm not a very experienced golfer, but I think I have a new favorite public course.  Even my colleague, who is experience, said after the fifth or sixth hole, "This might be a little premature, but I think this might be my new favorite public course in Phoenix."

After years of driving by this place a few times a week, I finally found myself within its doors, late on a Friday night.  I had heard good things about it, and curiosity and opportunity combined to bring me here.  My first impression from looking at the menu: it's expensive.  But it wasn't overly expansive, so I figured they just offer the dishes they do well.  Not a bad thing at all.  The italian cream soda was delicious.  I also started with the clam chowder, which was decent.  For my entree, I ordered the salmon piccata, as I was in the mood for a good light meal.  They assured me that it would not be cooked well done, with a little bit of pink left in the middle... However, the fish was as cooked and dry as any salmon I've had, and I was basically eating a plate of lightly sauced noodles and bland fish.  I know I wasn't looking for something heavy, but if I'm enjoying the capers more than the actual fish, that means it's too bland.  The ambience is nice though, and it's really nice to have a place in this part of town that is open past 9PM, but all I can say about the food is, "meh."  There is better, cheaper Italian food to be had in the Valley.

Played Red Mountain Ranch today, and my initial impression is that it's an excellent course.  It is by far rated the most difficult out of any I've played, at 148 from the tips, and 136 from the blue tees.  Even the white tees are 124 or so.  I suspect the reason the slope is so high is that there is a premium on accuracy.  You don't need to hit it far, as there are four or so 320 yard par 4s, but you don't always have a lot of room to work with.    For a semi-private course, I was quite unimpressed with the level of service rendered.  There was no beverage cart (not like I use those anyways), and there was no guy ready to swoop in and clean my clubs after the round.  The price was fair though, at just $35 for a 10AM tee time.  The condition was good for this time of year.  There were few dead areas, and the greens rolled true (though not as fast as nearby Longbow or Las Sendas), but it wasn't as lush as either of those neighboring courses.

Played here for the third time...and I've definitely changed my tune.    There are three reasons I never want to play here again.  First, they treat you like cattle.  They cram as many people in there as they can.  The tee times are close together, the staff doesn't really care or they're clueless (one of the staff members told us our guest doesn't get a discount, despite the fact that we are platinum Eagle card holders), and they don't tell you important things like there being a tournament happening while you are playing.  Anything to make a few extra bucks, right?  Second, the layout on two holes is dangerous.  If you hit an errant drive on the 13th hole, it can very easily land on the 14th tee box.  And the 17th hole is placed such that a miss to the right can easily hit the 16th tee box, and a miss to the left can easily hit the 18th tee box.  You have to constantly be on the lookout on those last few holes.  Finally, the clientele are a bunch of clowns.  Every time I play, there is a group behind or in front that causes problems (slow play, hitting into you, etc.).  Never had those problems elsewhere.    True story, we played this morning, and twice the group behind us hit into us.  On the 13th hole, I was standing no more than 250 yards from the tee, IN PLAIN VIEW, and I hear someone yell.  Someone's drive lands about ten feet from me and speeds right by.  Of course I turn around and stare the guy down, holding my club up in the air just to let him know that I'm not happy about this.  But I give him the benefit of the doubt...Maybe he didn't look at the GPS and thought I was farther out?  But then the last guy in the foursome hits his drive!  Of course it lands half way between me and one of the other guys in our group.  This guy just watched his colleague almost hit me, and he goes ahead and hits anyways!  One of the guys in our group kindly pointed out to the idiots that there are three groups right in front of us, and thus there is no hurry.    We later mentioned this to one of the cart girls, who said these guys are out here every week!  How could they not have known the distance if they know the course?  Of course they knew, they just thought it was OK to hit into people as long as they yell "fore."  On the 18th hole, unsurprisingly, the toolbags teed off while we were still hitting our second shots, and actually drove up within 30 yards of us while we were hitting.  I've never seen such terrible etiquette on a golf course before.  So between the uncaring staff, the dangerous layout, and the clowns who play here, there's no reason to play here when there are so many other great courses around.  Just drive down the street to Dobson Ranch.

Last night, while discussing dinner, my friend suggested burgers or Asian... And I recalled that Roaring Fork is said to do a good burger, and since it is down the street from the theater, we decided to check it out.  My first impression was that it is very classy.  When taking our order, the server mentioned that she had one order left of a special thick-cut pork chop, which *almost* derailed my plan to try out the Big Ass Burger.  But I stayed strong, and ordered the burger (medium rare, of course).  Along with that, I got the Weinhard root beer (they could do better than Weinhard, but at least they have something in a bottle).  The bread they brought out to the table for us to munch on was superb.  Especially the corn bread.  Someone also randomly brought us an amuse-bouche: it was seared halibut marinated in something and placed on a small piece of toast.  Bringing me small tastes of delicious food I didn't even ask for is the perfect way to win me over!  While waiting for our burgers, I observed the artwork on the wall in front of me - it was a watercolor print of a cowboy's lower legs, wearing boots with an Arizona flag on the leg.  This had to be a Nelson Boren painting, and sure enough, there was his signature in the corner (the piece was "July In Arizona").  It's nice sitting down at a restaurant and seeing artwork by someone with whom you once played tennis years ago.  The burgers themselves were excellent - perfectly cooked, topped with delicious chilis and bacon.  The fries were decent, and the chipotle mayo (or whatever that sauce is) works perfectly.  As far as the burger's name, "Big Ass" certainly does a swell job describing its size.  It was a good burger, although if you order it more cooked than medium, I could see the meat becoming very dry.  I was impressed with the place - both the food and the decor was excellent.  Next time, I won't be afraid to let a thick, juicy pork chop derail me.

We had been going to the chinese place in the same parking lot for a month or two, and I had been meaning to give this place a try... And holy crap, I think I have a new favorite place to eat lunch.  The first visit, we asked the guy at the register what would be good for a first-timer to try, and he said the Philly Cheese Steak is the best in AZ.  So I had that, and I don't know if it's better than a Corleone's cheese steak, but it was definitely good, and certainly priced much better.  Visit #2, I went with a half plate of the meat lasagna.  Delicious.  The sauce is flavorful, and the half plate, which comes with a side of garlic toast, is more than enough food.    Visit #3, I had the half chicken parmigiana sandwich and a slice of new york cheesecake.  The sandwich was saucy, cheesy, and all around great.  The cheesecake was probably a B+... Not quite what you get at, say, the Carnegie Deli, but nothing to scoff at.  There is all kinds of other crap on the menu that will bring you back for many visits.  A colleague had Il Purista sandwich, with homemade mozzarella, panscetta, among other things.  The counter is rife with delicious looking salads and desserts, and there are countless sandwiches and pastas.  There is even pizza, which I haven't even delved into yet.  The best part is the price.  You can generally get out of there with a $10 or so lunch, and considering the quality of the food, it's a very good price.  I could eat here every day.

This place is quite underwhelming.  Every three months or so, the thought comes up, "I haven't been to Cheba Hut in awhile."  And I go there, apparently not remembering why I hadn't been there in three months.  Why is that?  Because the sandwiches are small, the meat is sparse, and the prices (and possibly staff) too high.  Yeah, their gimmick is fun, but if you want a good, well priced sandwich, look elsewhere.

During my ASU days, this was my place to buy music.  Most of it was not actually on the shelves, but they would order it and (usually) have it there the next day, and it would still be priced well.  The people who run the place have always been very friendly, and they sincerely care about their product.  Not only was it a great place to buy music, but it was nice just browsing around for a few minutes if I had a break.  I consider this place an important part of my ASU experience.  Sadly, those days are gone.  They are now located in an out-of-the-way strip mall (not that the ASU location would've worked any better for me).  I have gone back and visited, and it just is not quite the same experience it was at ASU.  Their willingness to order whatever I want, which I considered their biggest asset, is no longer a convenience for me.    At least I still have my music junkie card and free t-shirt I got on the 20th CD purchase, and all the fond memories.

Lately, I have been making more and more visits to Hoodlums.  Part of this is my own move towards a more vinyl-based music collection.  Hoodlums has a respectable vinyl section, and I can always find two or three I like each time I'm in the store.  The staff is still friendly.  They still honor the old "music junkie" cards, despite discontinuing the program, which is a nice gesture.  The best part is all the free events they have.  There's not always a lot to do on a Friday or Saturday evening in the East Valley, so the free shows and movies they organize are definitely welcome.  Hoodlum is still the best record store around, and they're doing all they can to turn me into an even bigger music junkie.

I know everybody hates the Marquee, so it would seem a bit redundant to write a review on this hell hole.  But with its approaching the very highest echelon of suckiness, I think it warrants further comment.  Before last May, I hadn't been to the Marquee since 2010.  Back then, I just noted that it was drab and soulless, but a venue being nothing more than a large concrete cellar is not enough to warrant consideration for such a title as worst concert venue in America.  Let's count the ways in which The Marquee Theater sucks.  First, and this probably seems like a small gripe compared to some of the major problems with this place, you might have to pay $7 for parking.  I know a lot of venues charge $4-$5 for parking, but $7 is pretty steep.  Second, they obviously don't know how to run a will call line.  Someone else has already mentioned an hour-and-a-half wait for will call for Trampled By Turtles.  I was in the same line - OK, I know they're unexpectedly mainstream considering the fact that they're a progressive bluegrass band from Duluth, but still, they're a progressive bluegrass band from Duluth.  That's not exactly a recipe for a long line.  The Marquee created that by having will call and sales IN THE SAME LINE.  Way to treat your customers who have already paid, you douchebags.  I attended about 35 concerts in 2012, some of which are more popular bands, and similarly sized venues.  I didn't wait longer than 10 or 15 minutes to get into any of them.  If you manage to make it through the combined sales and will call line without going postal on the venue staff, then you get to be patted down by security!  I understand going through this procedure to get into a hip hop show.  But when is the last time a gang fight broke out at a Trampled By Turtles show?  Again, this is something unique to The Marquee - last year I attended shows at The Crescent Ballroom, Rhythm Room, El Rey, House of Blues LA, Royce Hall at UCLA, The Great American Music Hall, The Independent, Mesa Arts Center, The Neptune, Benaroya Hall, The Bowery Ballroom, and more - and at exactly zero of those venues was I patted down.  Music festivals?  Not patted down.  Bluegrass show at Marquee Theater?  Prepare to be violated.  This is not about safety, it's about stupidity.  Finally, the most egregious deficiency this place has is the crappy sound.  I noticed this when I saw Of Monsters And Men last May.  Over by the side wall it sounded like a mess.  I kinda wanted to hear the band, so I went and stood directly in front of the sound board.  It sounded OK.  So, this is how it works: directly in front of the sound board, you can at least hear what they're playing.  Anywhere else, it sounds like you're listening to someone's audience recording over the loudspeakers.  At Trampled By Turtles, I stood near the sound board, and it took me a good 30 seconds to identify the first song (it turns out that it was one I had heard a good three dozen times before).  How hard is it to mix five acoustic instruments?  Either the acoustics here suck, they don't want to pay for a decent sound guy, or maybe both.  If you run a live music venue, your most important job is to make it sound good.  The Marquee is like going to a movie theater where they sit everybody down in front of a 1985 Sanyo CRT television.  I have attended concerts in Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boulder, Telluride, Seattle, and New York, and I think now it is safe to say that this might be the very worst mid-sized concert venue in America.  Even the corporate Comerica Theater is better.  Theodore H., who is probably invested with this venue, says these complaints are all "standard stuff."  Again, I have been to venues across the United States, and this is all unique to The Marquee.  At this point, I think I can recommend staying away from here, even if one of your favorite bands is playing here.  Because it will just make you sad that you didn't really enjoy seeing one of your favorite bands.

Delhi Palace was really my first experience with Indian food, with its location near ASU and whatnot.  So, obviously, I liked Delhi Palace.  Until I tried other Indian places, that is.  I have since come to the realization that Delhi Palace is actually incredibly bland by Indian food standards.  They sometimes have a decent selection of dishes, but if you're looking for good flavor, drive up the road a couple miles to Taj Mahal.

4.5 stars. It's that high average over a huge number of reviewers that spurred me to eat here four times before forming an opinion. Unfortunately, I have to say, you're all wrong.  It's really baffling to me how so many people apparently like this place. It's amazing that they actually managed to make vegan burgers taste *worse* than McDonald's. Their bowls? The texture is all off. The flavors were not balanced. I've tried four different entrees here, and all were terrible. The fries were also mediocre.  It's like it's vegan food for people who don't actually want to be healthy.  What's really interesting about this Yelp rating is I decided to ask a few friends if they have eaten here, just to scope out what the general non-Yelper population thinks. I asked one of my fellow carnivore friends, and his opinion was "It's shit." Just this past weekend I asked a mostly-vegan friend what she thinks of Green. "Shit." Nobody minced words. All the real people I know seem to agree: it's shit.  I personally like the idea of reducing meat intake; it seems like the moral *and sustainable* thing to do. Believe me, I'm not some anti-vegan, Ronald Reagan-worshiping Republican; I can't stop eating at the delicious, all-Vegan Desert Roots Kitchen. I'll even order black bean burgers at normal restaurants (which are almost always an order of magnitude better than those flimsy, feeble patties they have here). This is just bad food. The only thing worth eating is the tSoynamis.  If you think about it, by serving up this terrible, overpriced vegan food, they're encouraging me to go eat more meat. How immoral.

Ate here once.  I found the burger utterly uninspiring.  It's pretty standard diner fare, except they don't do it particularly well.  It feels a bit like eating at a cafeteria with waitresses.  The staff is friendly enough, and the prices are fair, but they need more flavorful food, better decor, and less cheap feeling furniture.  Maybe a decent lunch option of you work within walking distance.

First things first, this is the best burger in Tempe.  Juicy, flavorful, and just the right size (if you get the great big one).  Good selection of condiments, too.  The onion rings and mushrooms are good, too (although it's hard to finish the mushrooms).  Nothing like a pile of grease to get your heart a workout.  The fries are nothing special.  They taste like your standard notch-above-BK fries... Not crap, but won't have you coming back like Five Guys fries.

For the price, you can't beat this place during the winter.  $75 (after tax, including range balls) during January, when everybody else in the area is charging $200?  Yes, please!  Everything was in great condition.  Greens rolled fast and true, and dead spots were nonexistent.  It's not the most interesting track, but it's got enough variety to keep it fun.  Really loved the back nine, particularly #11, #14, and #15.

I will admit, I have always been a detractor.  The moment someone labels something "Best (whatever) in (wherever)!" my immediate reaction is to think there is a giant media conspiracy afoot to trick all the gullible peons into thinking they're onto something really special.  So you can imagine my disappointment when, over a year ago, I finally got the chance to try this place, and found it to be...good?  OK, I still didn't think "Best in America!!!" was warranted, and I didn't think it was worth the 2-3 hour wait to eat dinner at a reasonably early hour, but the meal was clearly enjoyable.  Fast forward a year.  We're driving around town on a noble quest to locate the best pizza in Phoenix, and we decided we ought to try Bianco again, just as a yardstick.  Now I have had some of the most highly rated pies this fair metropolis has to offer: I've had different crusts, different toppings, different sauces, and I'm starting to notice the little things that make the difference between a good pie and a mediocre one.  Going into Bianco with this perspective yielded a whole different outcome.  I can no longer deny it: Pizzeria Bianco makes an incredibly good pizza.  The little things were all there: the crust was perfect, the sauce was fresh and flavorful, the ingredients were high quality.  The toppings were simple, yet sublime.  This time I had the Sonny Boy, which has nothing more than tomato sauce, mozzarella, salami, and olives.  A very unassuming mix of toppings indeed, and one in which the flavors worked together in perfect harmony to placate my tastebuds in the most authoritative manner imaginable.  No, it wasn't my favorite pie ever.  But it may have been the most well-constructed, and finessed.  In fact, I don't even know if I can say Pizzeria Bianco is my favorite pizza place.  I have had a few pies I liked better than the one I had at Bianco, but this one may have been the most technically sound, if that makes any sense.  So there you have it.  As much as it pains me to admit it, this place deserves its reputation.  One friend complained that they are too pretentious: I think they've earned the right to be a little bit pretentious.  If you're not too concerned about the details, you may not find this place to be that special.  But if you don't at least enjoy your pie, there is probably something wrong with you.  I don't know if Bianco will always be this good, since they're opening up other locations now, and when that happens, quality can suffer.  Let's hope for the best.

Lately my dad has been on a Tia Rosa's kick.  And when my dad gets on a restaurant kick, he likes to eat at that restaurant over, and over, and over.  And sometimes I get invited and come along.  After eating here a few times, I decided that it is simply just not deserving of the hype and traffic it gets.  The food is bland.  The salsa they give you is bland...even the "hot" one.  The quesadillas I got are bland.  The rice and beans?  You guessed it, bland.  They're definitely catering to the North Mesa crowd, whose Mormon pioneer ancestors apparently couldn't fit any spice in their wagons when they crossed the plains.  And would it kill you guys to put some cinnamon in the horchata?  Seriously...  Just go to their tacqueria across the parking lot and order the crab tacos with a Mexican Coke or Senorial Sangria... Much better option.

I was always hesitant to open my heart to this restaurant because (a) it has about the worst name they could have possibly chosen, and (b) it gets a lot of hype, but now that I work right across the street, I *have* to try it.  My first visit, I went with a tried-and-true classic, and something most people could probably agree is a barbecue bellwether: pork ribs.  Along with the ribs, I had their slightly disappointing lemonade (their beverage selection is quite weak for a barbecue place) and the beans on the side.  The beans were at an acceptable level of quality for a good barbecue place.  The ribs, however, shined.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, these ribs were smoky and tasty, and the meat just falls off the bone.  You don't even need to pick these up; you can use your fork if you wish.  Of course, I couldn't issue a verdict on a place like this after just one visit.  I went back, and this time for the smokehouse burger cooked medium rare, with shoestring fries.  I don't usually order burgers at barbecue places, but I heard good things about this burger.  And boy, did it live up to expectations.  I am not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers, but this one really worked.  Part of it was the crispy onion straws, and part of it was the fact that the cook was very close to the mark on the meat temperature.  The meat wasn't particularly lean, so it is a burger you can probably order medium and still have plenty of moisture left.  The fries were also tasty, and were a perfect complement for this burger.  Now, one thing I am not a fan of is the ambiance.  It doesn't seem to have that rustic feel that you usually expect from a barbecue joint; this place seems just a tad too upscale, if that makes sense.  But I cannot deny that they make some great food here.  One could make the case that, despite their horrible moniker, Bobby Q serves up the best barbecue in the Phoenix area.

I just realized that I completely forgot to write my review on this place.  A bit odd to forget to write a review on a pizza place when I'm driving around town trying all the pizza places, no?  Perhaps it's because their pizza was completely forgettable.  We showed up later in the evening, and I was having a very hard time finding a pie that I could get really excited about.  So I went with a straight-up meat pizza.  My friend went with a similar one, but a little more toned down.  I don't know what it was, but I just did not care for the pizza at all.  I didn't care for the crust - I thought it needed to be a little less tough.  They way overdid it on the pepperoni, completely overpowering everything else.  It was like Peter Piper without skeeball.  My friend made a better choice with his pie, but it would have still been below average at any of the wood fired pizza places we've visited lately.  The place was nice and quaint, though, and the attached grocery was kind of nice.  But LGO's pizza simply does not stack up.

After another lunch meeting that I didn't quite have the gumption to suggest be moved, I figured it is time to finally review this place.    Once upon a time, I was a poor college student who ate at cheap places, but loved "gourmet" food.  P. F. Chang's somehow built a reputation, albeit hardly deserved, of offering high quality "gourmet" Chinese food.  So, naturally, I decided that I wanted to try P. F. Chang's.  One evening before I graduated, the team decided to celebrate our impending freedom from Michael Crow's tuitionary grasp by dining at the P.F. Chang's across the street.  I don't recall what I had, but I think it was a Singapore Chow Fun (or something to that effect).  It was...passable I guess, but it cost $15, and wasn't even close to being as good as the Singapore Chow Fun I've had at Chinese take-out places in New York, and it cost over twice as much.  This poor college student could tell right off hand that this place is incredibly overrated (its average 3-star review is still too generous).  Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm in Houston for a job training regime.  The group decides to hit up P.F. Chang's for dinner.  I figured, since the company is reimbursing, I might as well give it another shot.  The appetizers were the best part of my meal, and the rest... well, it was the same drab, flavorless ennui we have all grown to expect from this place.  Then, of course, there was our lunch last week (once again, I didn't pay.  P.F. Chang's now occupies an important spot on my list of places I would never pay to eat at).  I had the honey garlic chicken, which didn't taste honey, garlic, or anything else besides deep fried chunks of chicken dipped in a lame sweet and sour type sauce.  I only ate half of it, which is worth mentioning, if you knew me at all.  And don't get me started on those lettuce wraps.  Those are the most overrated dish in the history of corporate faux-ethnic cuisine.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because their less expensive offering, Pei Wei, manages to be EVEN WORSE!  I swear, Pei Wei has only one sauce, whether you buy the Thai or General Tso's.  Do yourself a favor and just stick with your local neighborhood Chinese take-out place.  You'll get better food for a lower price.

Super cozy bar area, no sign indicating that a restaurant occupies the space, awesomely zesty carne adovada, the best chili rellenos anywhere... What else could you want? If this is New Mexican food, maybe New Mexico ain't so bad after all.

My favorite restaurant in Gilbert.  This is my kind of BBQ.  I'm a huge fan of pulled pork, and their pulled pork is perfect.  I like the pulled pork so much that I haven't been able to try any of their other meat selections, which look great as well.    On the sides frontier, their beans are excellent, as are the garlic potatoes and macaroni (real macaroni and cheese, not the box garbage).    The root beer is also a can't miss.  I'm no root beer connoisseur, but let's just say that I quit drinking soft drinks, yet always have the root beer at Joe's.  If you want something different, the root beer cake is also delicious.  The best part?  The reasonable price.  A jumbo sandwich (1/3 pound), two sides, and a drink will cost you only $11-$12.  Cut that to the regular sandwich and one side (a more reasonable lunch option), and you're under $10.

By now, I've purchased something at pretty much every outlet that sells records, new or used... That includes Stinkweeds, Tracks in Wax, Revolver, three different Zias, Bookmans, Rockzone... And I have to say, Stinkweeds is easily the best place to buy new vinyl.  That is, if you're into indie rock.  They basically cater to the hipster crowd, but that's OK, because I like some of that music.  If you're looking specifically for used vinyl, head elsewhere.  Actually, just go right across the street to Tracks in Wax.  That's not to say they don't have any good used records; just last Saturday, I found some nice copies of Born in the USA and Adrian Belew's "Lone Rhino."  Sweet!  And that's not even hipster music!  This is a good place.  If you're one of those people who, like Dave B., were apparently abused by a hipster as a child, you may not enjoy the vinyl records plastered all over the place, or the local music section.  As an added bonus, there is a candy store next door, where you can buy a Cheerwine or Gale's Root Beer.  Mmmmm!

I've been here three or four times now, and I figured it's about time I review this place.    First of all, the only reason I ever come here (after the first trip, of course) is because someone else is buying.  Because I would never pay $8 for two giant slices of bread with a few meager slices of lunch meat in between.  They have some great sandwich ideas there, but it's hard to realize any of those ideas when you can't even taste them between all that bread.  At least at Dilly's (at least the last time I went there), they actually put some meat on your sandwich, even if it doesn't hang over the edge.  Oh, and Dilly's also gives you *both* a pickle and a choice of various sides, instead of a pickle *or* a crappy bag of chips.  Truth be told, I'm being generous with this two star rating.  Bison Witches really sucks, when you consider how much it pales in comparison to Dilly's, which itself isn't exactly a gourmet sandwich shop.  EDIT: Allegedly they'll give you the pickle for free if you ask for it.  Not sure why that's not just the default option, but whatever...

Recently, I have been to several major US cities, and in each one, I made it a point to find the best sushi I could, with varying degrees of success.  One of my friends asked me, "Why haven't you found the best sushi in Phoenix?"  Lack of urgency?  Needless to say, we began a quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix.  It will be an expensive quest.  And I think we started at the right place.  We started with the miso soup with clams.  If you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like, imagine taking miso soup, and just adding clams.  I can't really think of any other way to describe it.  It's really that simple.  When the waitress took our order, we basically just went to town.  And everything was brought out, for the most part, one at a time.  This gave us time to enjoy each dish, and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived.  The first dish we had was the ankimo, or steamed monkfish liver.  This delicacy is something I had in Denver, San Diego, and San Francisco.  Here, it was served without ponzu jelly, but otherwise similar.  The others in my party, who hadn't had ankimo before, liked it.  Next, we had hamachi carpaccio, which was a hit.  These perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night.  After that, we had yellowtail tartare.  This got mixed reactions; I'm not sure what they used in the flavoring, but I did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it.  We then had the amaebi sushi (shrimp), which was served in two stages: first, the main part of the body, peeled and raw; and finally, the head, deep-fried.  I had deep fried shrimp heads before, but it was a first for my two dining companions.  Really, the head is the most interesting part, and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head.  Next was brought out a whole fried european sea bass.  This was one of the most passable items for me; I usually prefer my fish to be served raw.  It was a nice change from everything else, but I probably won't order that one again... Or maybe I'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs, and I didn't get one of them.  We then started on a rainbow roll, which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something "safe."  I ate a few pieces, but I never really get excited about rainbow rolls, or really any rolls.  Next they brought out the sushi: we had ocean trout, young yellowtail, and red snapper.  The waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces, and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce.  I liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form, and not just something to stuff your face with.  My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail, but all were good (and fresh).  Afterwards, we had one more sushi item: the foie gras sushi.  It's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras; it is distinct, but not overwhelming.  It was delicious, and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept.  For our last dish, we had the cook make us something of his choice.  He personally brought it to the table, and explained what it was.  He made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel, with foie gras on top.  As if the meal wasn't already awesome enough, this totally elevated it to a new level.  It may make me a snob, but there's nothing I like more than having a piece of art made just for me, and having the artist personally unravel it.  If you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form, this is clearly the place for you.  We finished our meal with the UFO dessert, which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura, and topped with ice cream.  It was pretty good.  Now, I have had some pretty good meals in my life, but if I were look back and consider which one was the very best, this one would definitely merit consideration.  It may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls, but if you like trying new and interesting things, you're sure to find some potential here.  The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none, as far as sushi restaurants are concerned.

Yesterday, our sushi quest brought us to downtown Scottsdale, where Dozo seemed like the most promising option.  I didn't think it would be top tier sushi on the way over, and the unassuming exterior of the building certainly didn't raise any expectations.  But some of the best sushi bars have humble exteriors, so this didn't deter us.  We started with the miso soup, which was average, and made our order: pork belly, salmon kama, albacore tataki sashimi, escolar sashimi, mackerel sushi, amaebi sushi, and salmon roe.  The pork belly was pretty good.  Not my favorite, but definitely tasty enough.  The salmon kama was decent; the kama is always my favorite part of the fish, and this did not disappoint.  Turns out I slightly prefer yellowtail kama, however (which they had), but that's because I like cooked yellowtail more than cooked salmon.  The escolar sashimi was disappointing - they garnished it with pickled jalapenos and tobiko, with a touch of ponzu; I would have much rather had it ungarnished, or at least sans jalapeno.  I like the flavor of escolar, and if I'm going to risk the diarrheaic side effects of escolar, I want to really taste it.  The albacore tataki, on the other hand, was superb.  As far as the sushi goes, the shrimps were good, along with their fried heads.  The mackerel and salmon roe were pretty average, which I guess is not a bad thing.  Finally, we finished with the tempura ice cream, which was the best tempura ice cream I have had in Phoenix.  I probably said that two weeks ago after having it at Hiro Sushi, but this one was even better.  Solid B+ on the tempura ice cream.  It also turns out this place is reasonably priced.  I have paid over twice as much for sushi on several occasions, and rarely spend less.  Hard not to appreciate this place, when they give you reasonably good sushi for such a reasonable price.

Why, oh why, do I keep giving Honey Bears a chance?  We were about to go to Happs' for lunch, and for some reason, I suggested Honey Bears.  Now Happs' is not great BBQ, but I am still regretting my decision to skip them today.  My coworker called Honey Bears an 8.5.  8.5!  So, what is wrong with Honey Bears?  Well, here it is in a nutshell: $11 for an extremely greasy pulled pork sandwich, some beans, and a bad fountain root beer.  I opened my sandwich up no more than 30 seconds after it was wrapped, and the entire bottom half of the bun was so soaked that half the meat came out during my futile attempt to pick it up.  The beans, well they were pretty good.  I've already mentioned the root beer, though.  One of my coworkers got the sliders, and they also had that soaked bun problem, and not nearly as much meat as the picture depicted.  When a restaurant has a menu as limited as Honey Bears', they darn well better do a good job on each dish.  If the food were reasonably priced, I'd say it's the McDonald's of BBQ... But you're paying almost as much as you'd pay at Famous Dave's, without anywhere near the quality.

Sometimes you have to be careful with whom you eat lunch.  We were thinking about burgers, and I suggested the best burger joint I'm aware of in Phoenix, The Grind.  But nobody wanted to spend $15 on a burger.  The driver of the car made an executive decision to go to Boston's, but it was too late - the car was already moving!  So, we arrive at Boston's.  I've already had their pizza, and it was uninspiring.  After you've had pizza in New York and Chicago, and even local joints like Pizzeria Bianco, and you have places like Spinato's in your rotation, an uninspiring pizza is not really even worth eating for lunch.  I started with the Mountain Dew to drink.  It was awful.  Coworker across the table said the Arnold Palmer wasn't very good, either.  Bad drinks - strike one.  I went with the jalapeno and onion straws burger, cooked medium.  But wait, they cook everything medium-well, according to the server!  Out comes my burger and fries.  I discovered that our waitress wasn't being entirely truthful about the burger temperature; they don't cook burgers medium well, but hockey puck.  These burgers are what you get when you accidentally leave it on the grill for two hours too long.  I suspect the restaurant staff, before opening, completes such preparatory tasks as hooking up the hoses on the soda fountain, wiping down the tables, setting up the chairs, and putting the burgers on the grill.  I wasn't too worried about spilling my drink because I had a nice, absorbent meat patty to soak up the moisture.  I could go on and on about those burgers...  And you have to love freezer fries.  Tastes just like home, at least if you're a bachelor like myself, and cooking consists of pulling something out of the freezer and heating it up.  One of my coworkers smartly pointed out that it's nice not having to worry about getting your hands wet holding your burger.  I pointed out that it's kind of nice not having to worry about your taste buds getting too excited.  Another nice, positive spin I put on the meal was that it would make the boring drudgery of the work day seem that much more exciting by comparison.  And finally, I lobbed my most viciously backhanded compliment on the place - the pièce de résistance, if you will - by pointing out how nice it is that we saved a whole $3 by not going to The Grind.    I will admit, it is nice to have dining experience like this every now and then.  It keeps things in perspective.  Because how else will you be able to truly appreciate a good, or even an average, meal?

It is a bit shocking to me that people like this place so much.  Have they just not had a really good pizza before?  I really don't get it.  The first time I tried Sauce, I went with the hand-stretched chicken pesto pizza.  It was OK - good crust, but a little too sparse on the toppings.  I really wish when they made these pesto pizzas that they'd try to make the pesto stand out a little more.  They always try to go light on the pesto because people in Arizona hate things that taste good, and pure, unadultered pesto tastes good.  My recent visit, I went to the Dana Park location, and I made a huge mistake - I accidentally ordered the thin crust.  I blame the person behind the register for not reminding me that they have two crusts (good, and pure sh*t), and of course, by default, they give you that horrible cracker crust.  So my meal was effectively ruined, even though I felt I made a solid choice with the portobello and artichoke.  People might tell you Sauce is good, and they might have even been eating their awful cracker crust pizza - but make no mistake, that crust is the worst.  If you get the flatbread pizza, you will be getting a much more average pie, and it may even be a reasonable choice for the Mesa/Gilbert area.  But I give them two stars just for offering that abortion of a crust as the standard option.

When is this stupid "Fresh Mex" craze going to end?  How many more dime-a-dozen Americanized (read: bland) Mexican places do we really need?  Over a decade ago it was Baja Fresh... That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places.  Then a few years ago we got Chipotle.  And it was fun for awhile, but eventually you get sick of eating the same rice-saturated burrito over and over and over again.  Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places.  I wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable (on rare occasions).  Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner.  Anyways, I had their "special" pork barbecoa (or whatever they call it), and it was pedestrian, at best.  It did not taste natural; sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet.  It's supposed to be nice and smoky.  It's supposed to taste like meat.  This place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture.  No heart, no soul, and large portions.  It doesn't matter what it tastes like, as long as it fills your stomach, right?  Cafe Rio is possibly the worst offender; I think I would rather eat at Qdoba or Costa Vida.

In my quest to find bottled soda to filled the void left by the closing of Pop the Soda Shoppe in Scottsdale, I decided to check out A.J.'s.  I've always been impressed by their meat selection.  You can't fault a place that sells crawfish, oysters, trout, and pretty much any other cut of meat you can think of.    When I found the bottled sodas, I was in heaven.  They have a chilled section with single bottles, and a shelf with packs.  They don't have a gigantic selection, but considering it's not a soda shop, you can't fault them for just having one shelf devoted to bottled sodas.  They had Sonoran Root Beer, Moxie, Boylan's Creamy Red Birch, Dublin Dr. Pepper, Sioux City, Oogave, Thomas Kemper, Jones...the list goes on.  Needless to say, I spent $30 there that day.  This is no Wegman's by any means... But I don't think we can expect a Wegman's replacement short of an actual Wegman's opening in town.

Legacy sets the standard for resort courses in Phoenix (actually, the standard is much lower!).  The course is excellent, with perfect conditioning, soft sand, and wide open fairways.  The practice facilities are convenient, and water is plentiful (which is nice during the summer).  This is also one of the best deals you'll find, with summer rates at $20-$30, depending on the time.  Can't beat that for this quality.  And I suppose it also helps that I had one of my best rounds here, avoiding anything worse than a triple bogey (unbelievable for me).  This definitely deserves a spot in the rotation.

Cafe Istanbul is a place that you need to familiarize yourself with before you can appreciate it.  It is popular for its lunch buffet (which, we found out yesterday, is temporarily closed), which always has a wide selection of salads, sides, meats, and other entrees.  If you want to try a little bit of everything, the buffet is a good option.  Where Cafe Istanbul really excels, however, is their menu.  Sometimes it takes discipline to order off a menu when you have a buffet in front of you, but it actually might save you a little cash, and you have choices that are simply not available on the buffet.  Lamb tongue sandwich?  Yes, please... Theirs is a little better than Haji Baba's lamb tongue sandwich.  Baked lamb over seasoned rice?  Incredible.  Humus, babaganouj, ma'anek (delicous lamb sausage) on the appetizers menu... all winners.  And sometimes I go here just so I can have that delicious soup (make sure you put some sriracha in it).  Fair warning: on some days, the service can be really bad.  Sometimes bad enough that, despite the great food, it is enough to discourage me from going there.  But it's a little easier if you go into it with that expectation.  This is a more recent problem, so hopefully they get that worked out... The people who run the place actually seem really nice, though.

Moreno's is a staple in the ghetto part of Mesa.  It's the type of place you go when you're craving some good, greasy Mexican food, and don't particularly mind the thought of getting mugged or having your car stolen.  This place might not win awards, but in the realm of hole-in-the-wall Mexican, they are at or near the top.  Of course they're known for having Sonoran dogs.  Their Sonoran dogs are a reasonable facsimile of what you'd find in Tucson, but if you're expecting it to be as good as El Sinaloense Hot Dog Cart, you'll be disappointed.  This is simple a satisfy-your-craving type of Sonoran dog.  While I usually grab a dog or two when I'm there, where they really shine is their tacos.  They have, of course, the boring carne asada, etc. that most gringos like, but they also have pretty good lengua tacos, and their tripa tacos are phenomenal (I have a very hard time convincing any of my white-bred compatriots to try the tripe tacos, but seriously, people: if you like bacon, you'll love the tripe tacos).  They do have much of the standard Mexican fare... Burritos, etc.  They have horchata, jamaica, etc.  I usually prefer to stick with the bottled sodas: Jarritos, Manzana, and my personal favorite, the Mexican Coke in 16-oz bottles.  Writing this is actually making me really crave one of those tripe tacos.

Lots of hype around this place, lines all the way out the door all the time... The first time I ate here, I had the Fontina Burger, and was quite underwhelmed.  I also had the date shake, which had barely any date in it.  I didn't want to write the place off, however, since Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants.  This time, I went with the hot dogs: Carolina and Sonoran.  The Carolina dog sounded pretty good, with its pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and slaw toppings.  It was decent, but not as awesome as I thought it'd be.  The franks seemed to be decent quality, and the buns were nice.  If you get a dog, this is probably the best option.  Now, I knew going in that the Sonoran Dog would not be an authentic Sonoran dog.  Sour cream?  Really?  But I tried it anyways, hoping it would at least be good, even if not a Sonoran Dog.  It was underwhelming; seriously, guys, at least make it spicy.  If it doesn't even have that in common with a real Sonoran Dog, why is it called that?  A Sonoran Dog has pinto beans, bacon, mayo, mustard, pico de gaullo, tomatillo sauce, is served on a bolillo roll, and is served with a grilled hot pepper.  You can't just slap some bacon and beans on a hot dog and call it a Sonoran Dog.  This should be a crime.  This is a blatant affront to all of the hardworking Mexican immigrants who, through their efforts, created Arizona's finest contribution to the culinary landscape.  The outdoor seating is nice.  That's really about it.  They don't even have the awesome homemade root beer or lemonade they have at Joe's Real BBQ. Skip this, and stick with Joe's other restaurants.

This place is really not good.  I'm really not sure why it is so highly praised.  I had the tilapia tacos, a Senorial Sangria, and the flan.  The tacos, at a somewhat steep $10 or so, were the most bland fish tacos I've had in awhile.  Toppings?  Nothing.  Just some cilantro or something; not even any cabbage or sauce.  Tia Rosa's Tacqueria has far superior fish tacos for a smaller price.  The rice that came on the plate was bland, but that's OK, because it's rice, and you don't expect much from that.  The refried beans were lousy and had no flavor.  The flan was terribly disappointing.  It did not have that creamy flan texture, and was actually as firm as cheesecake.  The taste was very dull.  Maybe Mexican flan is supposed to be that way... if it is, pretty much every other country makes better flan.  I did enjoy the Senorial, but pretty much every Mexican joint these days serves that.  One thing they do deserve props for is the service.  Considering how crowded the place was, they did an excellent job making sure there was water on the table, not messing up orders, etc.

Great Thai food.  I have eaten here about a billion times and have tried almost everything on the lunch menu.  We're such regulars here that the waitress didn't even ask what we wanted to drink last time, she just brought it out.    The only thing I don't like about the place is that the spice tends to wreck my digestive tract, but I can't blame them for that... After all, spicy food is supposed to do that.  Just don't go the day before you have a round of golf planned.  Definitely a step above the overcrowded Thai Basil, and the over slow Thai Elephant.

I've experience something of an about-face on this place.  I don't know if the food has gotten better, or my tastes have changed, but now, when I go, I find at least three or four dishes I really like.  Curry goat?  Yes, please!  On my first time going back in almost a year, they had the most warm, moist, delicious gulab jamon (probably butchered the spelling there) I've ever had.  Now I have cravings for those tasty little balls (I'll let you come up with your own punchline).

I walked into here with high expectations.  The decor looked great, they serve the drinks in a mason jar, etc.  But boy, was I disappointed.  Did it fill me up?  Heck yeah.  But it was the worst flavored BBQ I've ever had.  Something about it just didn't taste right... I've had smoky BBQ, tender BBQ, dry BBQ... But this was just weird BBQ.  It could have been soaking in curdled shrimp paste for all I know; I just couldn't put my finger on it.  And the price?  Very unfriendly.  If you're paying over $15 for BBQ, it better at least taste like BBQ.  I took off an extra star for the unjustifiable price alone.

Gave this place another shot.  The lemonade was definitely much improved, and some of the food was good.  The pulled pork was a little greasy, but the pork ribs were great.    I would be temped to give this place three stars, but not at a bill of $20.  For lunch.  "Overpriced" is still the best way to describe the joint.

For our sushi fix this week, we decided we wanted to try a place I had heard a lot of good things about, and we were willing to drop some coin, so we paid a visit to Roka Akor.  It was difficult to decide what we wanted, so we went ahead and sprung for the Omakase dinner.  We figured this would give us a pretty good idea what Roka is all about.  The appetizers came out first, one at a time.  The couple were butterfish and (I believe) tuna tataki.  The butterfish was the better of the two; the flavors were perfectly balanced.  It started out well.  We then had kumamoto oysters, one with ponzu sauce, and one with balsamic vinegar and caviar.  The balsamic oysters were off the hook; the waiter mentioned that this was a new invention by the chef.  Shortly thereafter, we were treated to some Japanese chili peppers, grilled and topped with freeze-dried mackerel flakes.  These were delicious.  The final appetizer was another new dish: seared big-eye tuna with asparagus in the middle, served on a cucumber and asparagus sauce.  We were then served the sashimi platter, which included six cuts of delicious fish (including sea bass, o toro, and a few other things I don't recall), and the most delicious, black truffle oil-coasted king crab I have ever tasted.  This was excellent sashimi, and where I felt the restaurant excelled.  We were served a miso soup with full shrimp, squid, scallops, mussels, and some mushrooms; this was another highlight for me.  For the entrees, we had the black cod, brussels sprouts, New York strip, and mushroom hot pot.  The cod was the most delicious cooked fish I have had, even exceeding last week's hamache collar.  They marinate the fish for 72 hours before slow cooking it, leaving it moist and supple.  The steak was good, but not particularly memorable - it was a juicy, tender steak to be sure, but you don't eat at this type of restaurant to enjoy a cut of beef.  Finally, we were given a dessert platter, which included green tea ice cream, a couple of custard dishes, and fresh fruit.  We also had the non-alcoholic cocktail they make with a Japanese fruit whose name I don't recall (it's difficult to remember what you were served when you didn't see it on the menu); the waiter described it as something akin to a lemonade with a tinge of tangerine, drizzled with honey.  The service at Roka Akor was excellent; the waiter treated us almost like a guest in his home.  They gave us fresh plates twice throughout the meal and cleared the used dishes in a timely manner.  Roka Akor is a very upscale restaurant, and the prices certainly reflect it.  We had a very good meal here.  They certainly know how to excite the taste buds.  I wouldn't say, however, that this is a particularly good place to get sushi.  And if you're interested in value at all, it's certainly not the best place to get Japanese food.  If you eat at Roka, you won't ever be disappointed in the quality of your food, but you can get the same quality, the same dining experience, and the same creativity elsewhere for barely half the price.  For that reason alone, they don't deserve quite the amount of hype they get.  It is a very good place for sushi and other Japanese cuisine, but not the best place to get it.

One word best describes this place: overpriced.  I had the miso soup, the Seafood Yaki Soba, mint lemonade, and shrimp tempura, and our table split a Lotus on Fire roll.  The Lotus on Fire roll was great.  Spicy and tasty.  Can't complain there.  The mint lemonade was also a nice tasty surprise.  There really wasn't much else beyond that.  The Yaki Soba was bland, and the calamari was overcooked and rubbery.  The shrimp tempura was tasteless, and the sauce that came with it had no flavor. And the miso soup was weak.  One of my colleagues ordered a plate of pickled veggies (I forgot what the dish was called).  It was mostly a pile of boring dill pickles, and a small spattering of other, more interesting vegetables.  What a ripoff.  Our bill?  $25 apiece.  A little ridiculous considering the quality of food.  They seem to have a motif at Tempe Marketplace: it fits right in with its neighbors, Lucille's and Maria Maria, with its artsy-fartsy decor and disappointing, overpriced food.

I've been to Genghis three or four times now, and each time it was delicious.    I feel I have to address a couple of the reviews that have been posted here.  First, there is Nadia's odd review about how "gross" for raw meat to be bloody.  Well, last time I checked, meat has blood.  Apparently she prefers frozen meat over fresh meat.  To each her own, but it seems a bit absurd.  Second, Jennifer "reviewed" the place without having actually eaten there, which strikes me as a bit closed minded and presumptuous.  I don't have the intuition to be able to judge a restaurant based on bowl size alone, but maybe she is just more talented than I.  On to the actual review... Genghis Grill is great.  Like I said, the meat is fresh, and there are several options: steak, chicken, turkey, pork, sausage, scallops, shrimp, cod, calamari, and probably some that I'm forgetting.  Oh, and did I mention that none of it is frozen?  After the meat, you are hit with a wide array of seasoning selections (Ashley mentioned that she would prefer sauces.  Apparently she didn't realize that there are also sauces at the end.).  Seasonings are necessary because they enhance the flavor, which is something that YC's could use.  My favorite is the Cajun seasoning.  Next you hit a wide variety of vegetables and other knicknacks.  There are almost too many choices; I have a hard time narrowing them down.  It also allows for different combinations; not all of your bowls have to be exactly the same each time.  Finally, you get to the sauces.  These sauces actually have flavor.    You also get a choice of what you want in the bowl with the stir fry; options include noodles and fried rice.    They also have strawberry lemonade, one of the rare restaurants with such an offering.  It is true that this place costs a little more than YC's, but it's worth it.  To those who say the bowl is small, sure, it's smaller than YC's, but when you add the rice or noodles, it fills you up, and you are limited at YC's by how much crap food you can stand to stomach.  There might be better Mongolian BBQs which I don't know about, but this place is legit.

I have one rule, and only one rule, when it comes to fish and chips: the thing you are eating should, in some way, resemble what you would expect to pull off of an actual fish.  Now imagine you are making your own fish and chips, and you are pulling off chunks of fish meat, which you will then batter and fry.  Geometrically speaking, what would you expect of these chunks?  Squares?  Probably not.  Either Pete has discovered a species of fish whose meat comes off in nice rectangular pieces, or it is made of heavily processed who-knows-what.  For the record, I suspect the latter.  Physical characteristics aside, Pete's does not have great fish and chips.  Perhaps I'm spoiled, but the fish I'm used to typically has a nice, light, flaky battering, rather than the dense, crunchy monstrosity covering Pete's fish tablets.  Add in less than average fries, and a refusal to allow you to at least put some tartar sauce on your processed fish, and you have an establishment whose continued existence is confounding, to say the least.

Sometimes you arrive at a restaurant, see the place, and feel like you should probably go try someplace else.  And if you go in, you figure there's probably a 50% chance your car turns up missing after your meal.  Pizza A Metro is one of those places, but it's good enough that you should go ahead and risk it anyways.  Set in one of the most unassuming strip malls they could have found east of the I-17, Pizza A Metro is a humble place that serves up some of the best pies in Phoenix.  I have had the capricciosa and whatever the pie with prosciutto is called (this place is so awesome that I can't even find their menu on the internet).  Both pies were pretty good, topping wise, although I would have preferred that they use fancier olives on the capricciosa instead of canned.  The crust was excellent.  One of the best I've had.  The sauce was right on as well.  Perhaps my favorite part is the bruschetta flatbread appetizer they give you while you're waiting.  It is delicious, and a nice touch.  This is definitely a rotation place for me.

I've eaten at The Farm a few times now, and I feel like I have a pretty good feel for the place now.  The Good: The sandwiches are fresh, and they have done a great job choosing ingredients so as to create sandwiches that are unique and tasty.  Each sandwich has its own toppings that work well in that particular sandwich... In other words, it's not just iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and onions in everything, like you'd find at a cheaper sandwich joint.  I had the flank steak sandwich yesterday, and was quite pleased.  I've also had the pulled pork, the pecan chicken salad, and maybe one other sandwich, but the flank steak is my favorite so far.  They also offer some good bottled sodas.  Stewart's Key Lime has always been a favorite, and I'm really enjoying the Virgil's Cola they have.  I haven't seen that soda anywhere else.  And the dessert selection is always tempting.  Perhaps the best part about The Farm Kitchen is the outdoor patio and picnic tables.  When you're working inside an office building all day long, sometimes the chance to spend your lunch hour outside is worth quite a bit (I may change my mind about that come summer, however).  The soups are also OK, although I've never been blown away by any of them.  The ones I've had are good, but nothing special.  The Bad: OK, there's no denying that this place is too expensive.  On balance, The Farm Kitchen is an excellent lunch option when it is nice out, when you're not famished, and when you're not on a tight budget.

Lebanese food is one of my favorite cuisines.  Having heard about this combined market/restaurant, and seen it on Howard Seftel's list of top Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, I decided to check this place out.  I couldn't decide whether it sounded more like a Haji Baba or Cafe Istanbul type place.  Upon entering the facility, it became clear that this place is much more market than the aforementioned establishments.  It's basically a grocery store, with a little corner cordoned off for the restaurant.  There is no table service; you order at the counter.  The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pies (I may have to venture into this territory; it's something Cafe Istanbul and Haji Baba don't have), plates, and sandwiches.  I was disappointed to find that they don't have lamb tongue, and that they were out of soujouk and ma'anek.  I went with the lamb sandwich, which didn't have the lamb in kabab form like you would expect, but rather as a ground-up kafta type of consistency.  The sandwiches weren't huge, but I will say, that lamb was nicely flavored.  And my dining companion mentioned that the beef shawarma was pretty tasty as well.  The food really is pretty good.  Cafe Istanbul still has this place beat.  This is true when it comes to food, but even more so when it comes to ambiance.  But it's nice that there is a respectable place to get Middle Eastern food in downtown Phoenix.

On our frequent lunch visits to Tacos Atoyac, we have always seen this place sitting there, a few stores away, beckoning us to try it.  After the relative failure our previous attempt at trying a new NY style pizza place turned out to be, it took us awhile to build up the courage to try another one, but we finally did it.  Raffaele's is somewhat of a dive, but we did note that at least they had air conditioning, unlike The Ol Whatever It's Called Pizza up on Peoria.  And the inside looked much cleaner.  The have specials on both walls, and you will notice how ridiculously cheap they are.  I went with a Sicilian slice, six wings, and a drink for probably like $6.  The wings were pretty decent.  Not the very best I've had, but I did enjoy them, and they didn't mess me up too bad inside.  If wings don't make my colon explode, I consider that an achievement.  The Sicilian slice was excellent.  Probably the best Sicilian I have had outside of New York.  It's worth going here just for that - a lot of Phoenicians don't know what the Sicilian pizza is:  it is awesome.  If you haven't had one, this is a great place to correct that.  This is certainly not the greatest restaurant in town.  It doesn't even have the best food in town.  But it excels at what it sets out to do: make a good New York style pie for a very reasonable price.

This is what Indian food is all about.  One of my coworkers introduced me a few weeks ago, and we have been going back every week.  The great thing, yes, the GREAT thing, about this place is they don't do buffet.  The setup is a bit different: For the lunch special, you get to pick from one vegetarian dish, one chicken dish, and one lamb dish.  Which dish it is varies each day.  With that, you get rice, some lentil stuff (forgot what it's called), naan, and yoghurt.  You may not have buffet selection, but you're getting plenty of food, and it's better than buffet quality.  I've had the vindaloo, the lamb poppy, and the chicken karahi, and they were all delicious.  And make sure you get a samosa with your lunch.  This place has the best samosas.

I figured since they added a buffet today, I might as well write an update.  As you might gather from my earlier review, I don't particularly care for the Indian buffet.  As such, I was a little concerned when we walked into Taj Mahal today and they told us the lunch buffet would be available for the first time today.  We decided, what the heck, we'll give it a try.  The first thing I noticed is they did not have a whole lot of selection at the buffet.  A positive sign!  They had rice, a chicken dish, a potato and cauliflower dish, Tandoori chicken, a lentil soup, some deep fried vegetables, chutney, rice pudding, yogurt, and maybe one or two other options (they bring the naan directly to your table).  I loaded up my plate with some of everything.  It became clear to me as I was eating that the buffet food did not lose any of the attention they place on the old lunch specials (which I'm not sure if they still offer).  The chicken dish had a delicious sauce, which holds its own against the old lunch specials.  The tandoori chicken was the best I've had; the flavors permeated all the way down to the bone.  I'm not sure I like it better than the old lunch specials... I really could've used some of their awesome chicken korma (I mentioned to my coworker that if they had the korma lunch special today, I just might have to order two).  I did leave thinking it was the best Indian buffet I've had, and I hope for their sake this move pays off.

In anticipation of what may be my last lunch at Fogo de Chão for a long time (a change in my work location will make this an untenable lunch option), a decided to write my review of this place *before* eating a meal there.  Once upon a time, Fogo e Brasa was the churrascaria in Phoenix.  It was OK from what I remembered.  It became Brazillian Bull, and more recent memories seem to conjure up images of salt shakers, salt flats, salt water, salt, rock salt, and even more salt.  Before I ever tried Fogo de Chão, I thought BB was a reasonable option due to its lower price, but after trying Fogo de Chão (which I actually like to pronounce as correctly as I can: "shoum" with a very soft 'm'), I decided that it would actually be a waste of money, and calorie budget, to go with the cheaper place.  So, why is Fogo de Chão so good?  Two things: the food and the service.  The salad bar and sides are great.  I always like to get a few of their fancy cheeses and the smoked salmon, and a few other odds and ends before my meal.  The Pão de Queijo is delicious.  It's OK to budget space for one or two pieces.  The meats are all good.  You do have to be careful, though: if you don't pay attention, you may find yourself with some chicken on your plate, which can take up valuable gastric real estate better used on a good cut of beef or their leg of lamb (my personal favorite).  They also cook them nice and bloody - every once in awhile, they undershoot it a bit, and the sheep jumps off the plate and runs away.  Best of all, they're seasoned well - even if you get stuck with a mostly-outside piece, it's not too salty.  The only complaint I have is that they never bring me the leg of lamb often enough.  And the guarana is $4.  A little steep for a can of soda, no?  Really, this is quite the fine establishment, and a worthy place to spend ~$40 on lunch.

Went here with a friend recently after some golf... It was the second time I had been here.  The first time was probably some time last summer, and all I remember is that I was unimpressed.  Decided to give it another shot, and ordered the Peak Burger.  This burger sounded like quite a nice sandwich, with andouille sausage, remoulade, ciabatta bread, etc.  I made sure to order it medium rare, but it was clearly cooked to well done, without even a touch of pink.  This, of course, left the meat nice and dry.  The bread was also overly crisp, and it was light on the sausage and sauce.    The fries were excellent, but it was easily the most disappointing hamburger I have had in some time.  A quarter of the way through the burgers (both of us ordered medium rare burgers, and both were well done), we notified the waiter.  He offered to have them remade, but we figured it wouldn't be worth the wait.  Oddly, we were not comped for the overcooked burgers.  Not even free fries, drinks, or anything.  No apology when he brought our checks...  I'll give them a star for good fries and IBC root beer (though they could pick a better root beer).  But I'll pass on the underwhelming entrees and cold treatment.

I'm always a sucker for some good, tasty gyros... And these ones are hot and tasty.  The service is great here, and the gyros and fries were tops.  The portions were acceptable--I've had bigger, but it was still filling enough.  Considering the dearth of good food options in the north central Mesa area, this place can definitely occupy a spot on the dinner rotation.

After getting into a discussion with a coworker about the merits of spending large amounts of money on single Japanese dinners, a craving for sushi set in.  I didn't think there were any good sushi bars nearby work, but considering we were just having lunch, I was OK with average sushi for this occasion.  The reviews for this place were middling, but the photos painted a different picture, so we gave it a shot.  We rolled up to the place, and found an empty business park, except for this one restaurant set back from the main road.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and not a location the hipsters and yuppies will be flocking anytime soon.  We sat down at the bar, and noticed a wall plastered with different specials.  Some rolls, some not rolls, some frog legs, some soups, etc.  A complete olio of handwritten dishes, some of which may have been up there for ages for all I could tell.  I ordered an assortment of sushi, the grilled hamachi kama, the ankimo (any place that serves ankimo is automatically above average), a bluefin toro hand roll (not on the menu, but I asked the chef to make me one), and an uni shooter.  As the sushi arrived, it became clear to me that the chef actually knew what he was doing.  He was an older Japanese gentleman with a hard-to-decipher accent, and clearly he was trained in the art of traditional sushi.  The sushi was properly garnished such that I didn't have to use soy sauce on but one or two items, the rice properly melted in my mouth, and the meal was properly paced.  Those who prefer their sushi Americanized and doused in wasabi may not find this place to be anything special, due to its lack of "scene."  But as a fan of traditional sushi, I would say this is one of the top three places I have found in the Phoenix area. And to think I had worked less than a mile away for nine months without knowing about it!

Being a fan of the Superstitions, I decided to scope out this trail on Saturday.  I arrived bright and early at 7:30AM, just at sunrise.  The first mile or so is a fairly constant uphill trek, and the most strenuous part of the trail.  It was also quite windy on the ridge, so I had to remove my hat for fear of losing it.  The hike then takes you along the side of the mountain above the canyon, giving you some nice views of some of the cool rock formations in the area, as well as Canyon Lake itself.  After another mile or so, the trail descends into LaBarge Canyon, which was dry at the time.  If you continue to follow the trail another 1/2 mile or so, you reach Indian Paint Mine, and then Boulder Canyon.  At this point, you can turn back the way you came, you can proceed south and connect with the Second Water Trail or Peralta Trail, or you can do what I did and hike back to the lake along the riverbed.   If you hike through the canyon, it's easiest if you try as much as possible to follow the main channel.  If you don't, it's easy to get caught up in the brush, and if you're wearing shorts (as I was), your legs can get a little scraped up.  About half way between the Indian Paint Mine and the lake, the canyon narrows, and in between the canyon walls are some nice pools and foliage (I should note that at this point, I first encountered another human being).    When you're nearing the lake, you'll come to a point where the river makes a strong curve to the left.  You'll see a relatively steep, but wide, rock face to scramble up.  There is a cairn or two to help you out, but it is relatively easy to find your way.  Just go uphill, and you'll eventually meet back up with the main trail.

I took another trip to Boulder Canyon the other day, and this time the creek was flowing.  It certainly added a whole new element to the trek, and made it somewhat more difficult.  There is one point in the canyon narrows where it is impossible to avoid wading through thigh-deep water without climbing over a 30-foot vertical rock wall (not recommended--just enjoy the water!).  It took almost an extra hour, although this time I had some other people with me, and did a fair amount of waiting.  If you don't mind getting a little wet, go after it rains (not while it rains; flash floods could be a concern).

There are a lot of pizza joints in the Valley, and reading the reviews of each one, you'd think they all serve the best pizza in town.  The Parlor is no exception.  I didn't think The Parlor would be the best in town, but it had one thing going for it: the menu.  I like their space.  It's not as quaint as Cibo or Bianco, but it has a far nicer vibe than Federal a few miles down the road.  They get points for having professional, yet relaxed, servers, and no loud music.  There isn't a scene here: just a variety of people out to have a nice meal.  It's not a glorified hipster bar like Federal.  Right after being seated, I perused the menu, and found several promising pies.  The only thing I really liked about Federal was their pizza ideas: The Parlor is even better.  In addition to pies, The Parlor has sandwiches, salads, and some tasty looking appetizers and antipasti.  I had the lemonade (allegedly from a farm in Mesa), the caponata bruschetta, and a 8" Puttanesca pie.  The bruschetta sounded like an excellent idea: eggplant caponata, currants, roasted peppers, pine nuts, and ricotta on toast.  The flavor was a little more bold than I was expecting, but it was good.  I think I would've cut back on the currants.  Of course, the pizza is the centerpiece of the restaurant (it is a pizzeria, after all).  I am sad to report that the Parlor does not make the best pizza in town.  The crust is average at best.  It wasn't bad enough to be a distraction, but it didn't have the best flavor or texture.  The ingredients (I'm looking at you, cheese!) didn't seem to be the highest quality.  My pizza was much greasier than a pie with nothing but calamari, shrimp, capers, spicy tomato sauce, olives, and fennel should be.  The cheese is clearly the culprit.  That said, the toppings were delicious.  Calamari on a pizza is something that needs to be done more.  It could've used more capers and olives (were there even any olives??).  The flavor profile was very good, even if the ingredients were subpar.  My friend went with the Mare.  I tried a slice; this was actually a very good pie.  Possibly one of the best pies I've had, as far as toppings go.  When it comes down to it, The Parlor is a solid restaurant, with a very solid menu and a nice ambiance, that could benefit from a little more attention to detail.  It strikes me as the type of place where the chef's heart is in the right place, but he is probably dealing with investor owners who don't want to shell out for the best ingredients.  It's hard to say, but at any rate, it's a place I'd go back to.  You could do worse at some of the Valley's more popular pizzerias.

We went here for dinner before a show at the Mesa Arts Center, as this is one of the only dining establishments within walking distance (go downtown Mesa!).  It went something like this:  6:15 PM: Arrive, sit down right away 6:20 PM: Someone takes our order 6:30 PM: Waiter says he'll check on our food 6:45 PM: Waiter says he'll check on our food 6:50 PM: Waiter says our food will be out in two minutes 6:55 PM: We get our food 7:10 PM: Finished eating 7:15 PM: We get our bill 7:20 PM: We finally get to leave.  Yes, it took over half an hour to make two bowls of curry.  I understand it's the dinner rush, and that there is a show across the street, but you have access to their schedule!  Make sure you hire some people so you're not under staffed!  Besides that, the food was not that great.  Maybe I got a bad bowl, but it was incredibly watery, and the chicken was dry and overcooked.

This place is delicious.  I'm not Puerto Rican, but I've had home cooked Puerto Rican food in New York, and I've always been a fan.  And as far as Puerto Rican food is concerned, this is excellent.   I had the Canu and Arroz con Gandules, and they were delectable.  The Canu is a sweet plantain stuffed with flavorful ground beef and melted cheese.  Hard to find something like that!  The reason I'm only giving this wonderful place only four stars is because (a) I had to spend almost $15 before being satisfied (the profile here shows it as $, when it should clearly be $$), and (b) there were no fountain beverages, only water and bottled/canned drinks.  It was worth it, however, and I will certainly be back.

I have now played Longbow three times (twice in 2009, and once in 2010).  I do have to say it's a fine course for all tastes.  I can't say it's a 5 star course, because it doesn't have quite the scenery and/or elevation changes that some that are nearer to the mountains have.  But it has enough interesting holes to make it a unique experience.  It's not a gimmicky course by any means.  The course is more or less flat, with enough mounding on the fairways and around the greens to make it challenging.  One major advantage this course has is that there are not any houses on the course.  This means you don't have to worry about breaking anything if you like to slice the ball; the worst that can happen is that you lose your ball in the desert.  I also really like the fast greens.  These greens are among the fastest and the truest I've played, and it's really a delight to putt on them.  This is a great course for a cheap afternoon round during the summer.  For $40, you are probably better off going a few miles down the road to Las Sendas, but sometimes in the afternoon rates can be had for under $30.

I've been looking for a decent Indian option in Central Phoenix, and this place seemed to be getting the best reviews.  The good?  The naan was at the table when we were ready to eat, which is nice.  The service really was pretty decent here.  They had veggie samosas, and a couple of different daal dishes.  The paneer tikka or whatever it was called was good, and something I don't typically see on Indian buffets.  Unfortunately, the curries seemed a little too soupy for my taste, and there were only two options (Curry Chicken and Butter Chicken, booooooring).  I guess I'm now spoiled after so many excellent trips to Kabab Palace in Tempe.  Oh well, I guess I still don't have a good Indian option for Central Phoenix.  At least the price was reasonable.

This place is pretty good for a cheap, quick dessert.  The yogurt tastes pretty good, the toppings are plentiful, and they always have some good frozen yogurt flavors.  Try the toffee yogurt, it's great.  They're also more than willing to let you sample as many flavors as you want.  Just one note, I know the large is only $0.50 more than the small, but don't do it!  That's a lot of frozen yogurt, and nobody needs to eat that much frozen yogurt.

A year ago, we checked out The Sandbar for their crawfish taco Mardi Gras special... And they were delicious.  We went back a few times, and there were certainly some other nice tacos on the menu, but they weren't always consistent.  I stopped eating here when, one day, the waiter brought me an extra taco I didn't order (none of the five other people at the table recalled it, either).  I mentioned to him that I only ordered three tacos, and his response was, "It's OK, they're only $2."  Great point, sir: you see, your tip was going to be $2.  I guess it all works out! (Honestly, I would have still tipped had his response been something remotely resembling an apology.)  Seriously, though, that was the first time I was ever expected to pay for something I did not order.  For some reason, we decided to go back again this week to see if they still had the crawfish tacos for Mardi Gras... And they did!  Unfortunately, they were not $2 like the other tacos.  Even worse, they didn't mention that they were actually shrimp tacos with a few pieces of crawfish in them.    Sorry, Sandbar, but this behavior is NOT OK.  If you're going to advertise something as crawfish tacos, it sure as hell had better not be shrimp tacos with a few sparsely placed pieces of crawfish.  I don't want to pay $4 for twelve crawfish (our waitress who neglected to mention that the crawfish tacos are not crawfish tacos did get a tip, but it was the bare minimum for her bad service, which was not just limited to the taco information).  Besides the deceit in regards to the menu items, the service here is consistently bad.  Don't expect to have a drink in front of you for more than 50% of your meal.  Fool me once...

Pretty middling.  The Black and Bleu burger was a respectable middle-tier burger.  It came with "seasoned fries," but I'm pretty sure the only thing on them was salt.  I guess salt is technically a seasoning...  I had their on-tap root beer, which they tout as having a slight toffee and vanilla taste.  I would've liked to taste more toffee (hardly noticeable) and less vanilla.  I'm not a fan of vanilla; it makes a root beer taste a little too weak.  Give me more sassafras, maybe a touch more wintergreen, and drop the vanilla.    Overall, it's not a bad meal for the money, but it's pretty unspectacular.  I guess you can't expect a whole lot from a pizza chain...

Siphon Draw trail is probably my favorite Phoenix area hike.  It provides a great mix of unique scenery and physical exercise.  The first mile or so, beginning in Lost Dutchman State Park, is relatively boring and easy, but it gets interesting when you approach the cliffs and begin to gain elevation.  After the next half mile or so, which is decidedly less maintained than the beginning, you come up to a smooth basin known as Siphon Draw.  This provides a nice shady area to rest, or if you're just looking for a nice stroll, a good turnaround point.  Once you pass Siphon Draw, you're met with a seemingly vertical quarter mile scramble up to a small saddle.  If you struggled to mightily to get up to this point, this could also serve as a good spot to turn around, as it only gets more difficult.  The remaining half mile or so to the top of the plateau is a rocky climb that gets steeper and steeper as you go, with some minor climbing involved in a few spots, until you reach a 12 foot vertical wall at the edge of the plateau.  Once you pass this barrier, you are atop the plateau, where you can either hike a relatively flat quarter mile to the edge of the cliff formation known as Flatiron, or hang a left and continue to the top of Superstition Mountain.  The views from atop Superstition Mountain are phenomenal, with a 360 degree panorama of the Superstition Wilderness, Four Peaks, and the Phoenix area.  It's a strenuous hike, with an elevation gain of almost 3,000 feet (most of which occurs in the last mile of hiking), but it's always a fun time.  Bring enough water, and be careful not to slip or break your ankles on the way down.  Note: Parking in Lost Dutchman State Park costs $5 per vehicle.  Free parking is available a mile or so down the road at the First Water Trailhead, but you'll have to hike an extra mile or so each way.

I've eaten at several local Peruvian places (Villa Peru, Contigo, Inka Fest, the now-defunct Rincon Peruano), and for some reason, Contigo Peru sticks out the most (with Inka Fest a close second).  Everything I've ordered here hit the mark; I've had the fried yucca root and choros a la chalaca (nice kick to it!) appetizers.  I can't get enough of the chicha morada (who would've thought a purple corn drink could be so delicous?).  As far as entrees, I've had a couple of the saltado dishes, and they were good, but never really my favorite Peruvian offerings.  The parihuela was good, although I wish you can get it in a half serving so you can have that and something else.  Most recently, I had the Pescado Contigo Peru, which was a fish filet with scallops and a few other things, served with a delicious spicy sauce and yucca root.  This is my favorite entree so far.  The flan is also respectable; it's a no-frills flan with a nice light flavor.  Not too overbearing.  If you haven't had Peruvian cuisine, this is a good place to see why a bunch of chefs ranked Peruvian cuisine as the second best world cuisine after French (citation needed).  A final note about the restaurant: they seem to have remodeled since my previous visit, and it's more welcoming inside now.  The portions are very generous - you will be filled, but you'll also pay $25-$30, depending on whether you get appetizers.  And the service is typical of what I've seen in Peruvian restaurants - friendly but laid back.

If there is anything I'd miss if I were to leave Phoenix, it would have to be the Mexican food.  That's what we're good for (and to think we're trying to get rid of the Mexicans!).  There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall, everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's, Garcia's, and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places.  La Condesa is one of those niche places, and one of my favorites.  Here, their niche is a slightly fancy take on really simple items like tacos, salsa, and quesadillas.    The tacos come in several varieties, with meats including chicken, beef, pork, whitefish, and even dogfish shark, and different spices and toppings on each one.  My favorites are, of course, the shark, as well as the black mole, and one of the beef ones (not the Sonoran).  The salsas are also a big draw: prepare to be blown away as you dip your chips in peanut salsa, strawberry salsa, cilantro salsa, or even my personal favorite, pecan salsa.  There are typically about 20 choices, so if you want to try them all, come with a few friends (it does get crowded, though).  The quesadillas are also delicious; they're a southern Mexican fried style.  They're quite heavy, so don't plan on being able to eat two or three tacos *and* a quesadilla.  Oh...and GET THE HORCHATA.  You won't regret it.  I won't describe it, just because I don't want to ruin the surprise.  But it will blow your mind.  Whenever I get it, which is always, someone always asks me what that delicious-looking beverage is.

Stonecreek is a nice place to play, and the price is fair.  I do like the layout.  Fun but not gimmicky.  The scenery is nice, too.  I will have to agree with others about the ball vacuum (aka creek) running right through the middle of the course.    The staff also seemed nice enough when I was there.  I'm not sure what others were complaining about.  Overall, it's a decent place to play, and its location makes it ideal if you're meeting people from the other side of town.

What is there to say about this place besides "unlimited golf?"  I drove an hour and a half to get to this distant location, conveniently located right in the middle of B.F.E.  I figured, what the heck, it's unlimited golf.  Right away I noticed that there were very few people there, and it was in excellent shape.  This Troon course is very well maintained; the grass was green and the greens rolled true.  The course is also very playable, with wide fairways throughout.  I hit 12 of 14 fairways on my last 18.  45 holes after starting, and after a very enjoyable day with good golf and no crowds whatsoever, it was time to finally call it quits.  It's a shame this place is such a drive, or else I would show up for unlimited golf every month during the summer.  But then again, if it were closer, there would probably be crowds and no unlimited golf, right?  Also, I hate those two par 5s on the back.  They are going down next time!

Now THIS is good Caribbean food.  We wandered in a little after noon, and the place was empty... Four tables, and the nice lady who runs the place.  I could tell right away that this was going to be authentic.  I ordered the curry goat, and washed it down with a bottle of Kola Champagne.  It was just like old times, when I was offered curry goat by a Jamaican woman I knew in New York: "Would you like some curry goat?" "I don't particularly care for goat." "Have you had curry goat?" "No." "You're having some curry goat." Yes, curry goat is delicious.  This curry goat definitely met expectations, with a hearty flavor, and very tender.  It had the texture of a good pot roast.  And it had some potatoes mixed in, which taste great when soaked in curry goat juice.  The plate also came with some rice, some of the most delicious plantains I've had, as well as a green salad I could have done without, but ultimately appreciated because I really should eat my vegetables.  No, they're not the fastest place, but it's really like eating home-cooked Caribbean food.  And you don't go eat at someone's house and expect their service to be the most efficient, do you?  The essence of this place was perfectly captured by my coworker, who after I mentioned it might be added to the rotation, said, "F@#k the rotation, I'm eating here every day!"

I've had two recent opportunities to try out this place.  It seems there has been a trend in the Valley: there are a lot of newish burger places.  Some of them are chains (Five Guys, Smashburger), and some are gourmet burger joints (Delux, Zinburger, etc.).  I, personally, always welcome a new burger joint.  My first visit, I was flying solo on a Friday night, and sat at the bar.  This isn't the type of place at which you would typically want to be seen dining alone on a Friday night, but I will always maintain that it is my friends who are lame, not me.  Thankfully, the girl working the bar was nice and friendly.  Zinburger definitely gets points for friendly service.  I also appreciated that they let me drink a bottle of the Thomas Kemper Orange Cream Soda that they presumably use for the 50/50 floats.  Having a bottled or on-tap soda with my burger always makes the meal more complete.  As far as the actual burgers are concerned, I'd say they're pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  The toppings are where they shine - there are about a dozen different cheese options, as well as bacon, avocado, peppers, wild mushrooms, a fried egg, and a variety of sauces that aren't listed on the menu.  Get a good combination, and a medium rare burger there really is quite respectable.  The double truffle fries are also excellent, and the zucchini fries aren't bad (though I couldn't even eat half the order).  And right now, they have a blackberry peach lemonade that is spectacular.  Finally, a word on the shakes: they're good, but not $6 good.  Truthfully, this place is borderline five stars, but the only reasons it's not, in my mind, is because I've had Diablo Burger in Flagstaff, and you can plan on spending at least $20 for a burger, side, and a drink.

Arizona Grand is widely considered among locals to be a bit of a joke.  Very gimmicky, and when I played it, one or two of the greens was in terrible shape.  Fairways are tight, and it's all over the place as style is concerned.  And have fun driving your golf cart through cul-de-sacs because of the bizarre layout!  Go play it if you find a screaming deal (or it's free), but for the price, you're much better off driving a few miles down the road to The Legacy, which is far superior.  The other reviews are perplexing to me, as I've never met someone who actually liked the Arizona Grand.

I was skeptical of this place when my coworkers told me about it, but when I walked in for the first time and saw the wall of bottled sodas, I changed my mind.  They didn't even mention that!  Seriously, though, they have a lot of sodas.  A whole refrigerator full of root beers.  A row of birch beers, a couple rows of colas, a row of Faygo sodas, a couple rows of ginger ales/beers... Really, every soda you can think of besides spruce beer (I guess I'll still have to go to California to stock up on spruce beer).  Of course, this is also a burger place.  The burgers are fantastic, as long as you're not expecting a gourmet, 95% lean, thick patty $12 burger.  It is better than the Five Guys and Smashburgers of the world.  Try the New York burger (Pastrami, slaw, rocket sauce), the Santa Fe burger (bacon, fried green chili, rocket sauce), or the Baja burger (pico de gallo, bacon, rocket sauce I think).  Those are my personal favorites.  I have also had the gyro burger - pass on that one; the tzatziki sauce is great, but the gyro meat is probably the frozen variety.  They don't specialize in gyros here.  I pay this place a visit every week now.  The fact that their A/C doesn't seem to work well in the summer doesn't even dissuade me.  My biggest complaint is that they have a soda fountain.  People who prefer carbonated sugar water over delicious specialty sodas are simply not worthy - they're casting their pearls before swine.

We drove by this place next to Taj Mahal, and decided, when we saw a new Peruvian place, to stop in for lunch.  I hadn't had Peruvian food for some time, as Rincon Peruano is a bit far to make it a realistic lunch option.  The first thing I noticed is that the menu was very disappointing.  The selections were limited, and they were listed in English with Spanish translations secondary.  Sorry, but "Poor Man's Steak" just does not sound as appetizing as "Bistec a la Pobre."  Thinking that maybe this was an authentic place that just didn't have everything on the menu, I asked the server if they had Parihuela.  He looked at me like I was speaking Greek, indicating that not only did they not have it, but he was probably not actually a Peruvian.  With this minor setback behind me, I ordered my food, and what seemed like an eternity later, we had our meals.  The portions were acceptable, the presentation was good, but the actual food was pedestrian.  It wasn't terrible, but Rincon Peruano did the same dish better, and in greater quantity.  The bill?  $15.  Probably $3-$4 more than it should've been.  I guess we still don't have a reasonable Peruvian lunch option.

I've played Foothills a couple of times.  Not bad at all for the price.  The Foothills has some decent scenery, and it's been in decent shape both times I played.  The layout is nice, with water coming into play on three or four holes.  For the price, it's much better than comparable courses in the East Valley.  You can usually get a spring twilight round or a summer round for a very reasonable rate (~$30?).  The practice facilities aren't the greatest.  The layout is kind of confusing.  The course isn't particularly difficult, although I want to murder the 17th green.  Those bunkers are going to get it next time.

Finally had a chance to try this place.  It's definitely a small place, which cheap chairs and plastic tables, so it's not a place you go for the vibe.  The menu apparently changes every weekend.  I had the Mofongo y Pernil, a cola champagne, and the flan.  The mofongo was delicious, and the pernil was ace.  And it was just $7 for the place, which didn't leave me hungry at all.  The flan was not homemade, which was a bit disappointing.  And the cola champagne came in a can rather than a glass bottle, which I would have preferred.  But I guess one can't be too picky when there is a Puerto Rican place a couple miles from home.  The whole meal was just $12, which is very reasonable.  It's just too bad I can't go pick up my dinner here on weeknights...

Just had lunch here.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The food was good.  I had a green chili pork burrito, which was deceptively filling.  The pork tasted excellent, and the added guacamole and sour cream on top made it even better.  The lemonade was also great.  Service was excellent.  They always brought more chips just as we were running out, and the beverages were well stocked.  The best part of the whole meal was the cream filled churros.  With all the sugar on it, the cream is totally unnecessary, but who's complaining?  Strawberry and whipped cream to dip it in just pushed it over the top.

I'm not sure what everybody is complaining about; our service was spectacular.  Maybe you only get good service on the patio?  Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and helpful.   The food?  It was great.  Let's see if I can remember what we had:  Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo (crab stuffed pepper): 4/5.  Decent, but not as substantial and epic as this dish could have been.  Tortilla de Patatas (potato pie): Too dry, a bit disappointing.  Almondigas con Tomate (meatball): Eh. Pretty typical meatball.  Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic and white wine): Delicious.  We all agreed that it was the best shrimp any of us have had in awhile.  Caracoles aioli (glazed escargots): I hadn't had escargot before.  It was a good experience, although I had to most of them myself.  Probably won't order them again for risk of that happening again.  Chorizo: Meh.  Not bad, but nothing really to it.  Just sausage.  Rabo de Buey (oxtail): Amazing.  Best thing I've eaten in awhile, period.  Valenciana Paella: Delicious.  This put the meal over the top.  Because we didn't have drinks, the damage was less than $25 a pop.  And we were stuffed.  I'll definitely be back.

Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.  This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.  It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.  I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.  The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.  The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.  I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.  Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation.

A couple weeks ago, we decided to pay Brick a visit.  I am a fan of Wild Thyme's two north Central restaurants (Timo and especially Spoke & Wheel), so I had to try it out.  I was a little apprehensive because of its middling reviews, but on the other hand, most of those reviews only seem to complain about service.  Get over yourselves, people.  Two of us had pies, and the third diner had a burger.  Their burgers seem to be the same that are offered at Spoke & Wheel, and they are delicious there.  I went with the pizza, but I heard the burger was good.  The pie was excellent, but as a pizza destination, Brick suffers due to its proximity to Bianco.  Why would you go have pizza at Brick when Bianco is practically right across the street?  I'd be more inclined to visit Brick if I'm looking for a burger.  The ambiance is very warm and laid back.  They seem to encourage hanging out.  Which is pretty cool.  We also had the peach cobbler, which was delectable.  This place would be better if it were in Tempe, or Mesa, or somewhere else that doesn't already have a high concentration of excellent pizzas.  Oh, and the service was not that bad.

After waking up from an evening nap, and not wanting to let a perfectly good night lapse without my leaving the condo, I decided to go get some pizza.  A couple of friends mentioned Grimaldi's, so I decided to give it a shot.  It was difficult driving right by my favorite neighborhood pizza joint without caving, and even more so when I saw the Macayo's (kidding!).  But I stuck with the plan, so here we are.  I was seated at a table, and took a glance at the menu while waiting for my server.  Then I took another glance, started figuring out what I want, noted the lame fountain drink selection, studied the menu more, flipped it over and glanced at the wine list just because, looked at the toppings again, made it half way through Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time", assembled a small airplane, waited a little more, and finally decided that the server was not going to show up if I didn't say something.  The waitress finally showed up and apologized, explaining that she did not see me there.  Crap, I left my invisibility cloak on again! My bad!  Seriously, though, her service was markedly better after she became aware of the fact that I exist.  One thing I should note about the menu is that they don't have specialty pizzas that they have carefully crafted and deemed as worthy topping combinations.  I don't particularly care for this setup.  To me, an important part of cuisine is the whole art of the thing, and if you walk into a good restaurant, you are served something with the chef's personal touch.  You don't get that here.  I understand that some unsophisticated diners like to have the same toppings on each and every pizza, so it is fine that they allow you to pick your own toppings.  But all I'm saying is that they don't deserve any credit for that awesome pesto, artichoke, ricotta cheese, and mushroom topping combination I concocted.  The actual pie was fine.  This is a chain, and it is far better than most pizza chains I have been to.  Possibly even better than all of them.  But when they say their coal-fired pizza is better than wood-fired pizza, I have no choice but to compare them to the wood-fired pizza places.  In effect, they're entering themselves into a competition they can't win.  Because those places make artisan pies, and they cater to a whole different market.  Finally, the prices here are exorbitant.  They comped me for the poor service, and it was still $3 more than I would pay for a far superior experience down the street at Il Bosco.  A three-topping personal pizza with a crappy fountain drink will hit you at about $20 before tip.  This is absurd.  So there you have it.  If they stop acting like they're an artisan pizza place and drop their prices accordingly, they would run circles around the California Pizza Kitchens of the world.  But they can't compete with the Cibo's, Bianco's, Il Bosco's, or even Pomo's of the culinary landscape.

Any place that offers a well-executed bacon shake is worth trying.  I didn't even know that before I ate at PV Burger the first time, so it was a nice surprise.  My first visit, I went with the Brulee Burger.  It was OK.  Second visit, I had the Philly Burger daily special, which had two tempura-battered patties, cream cheese, and a couple other things.  The Philly Burger was pretty tasty, and maybe a step above their signature brulee burger.  The fries are pedestrian, but I haven't had any other sides.  Prices are a little steep here, and I like getting a shake, so now I tend to stick with just a burger and a shake just to keep my financial and caloric budgets under control.  I already mentioned the shakes.  I was skeptical of the bacon shake after the miserable bacon soda experience I had last year, but this bacon shake is done well.  It tastes like bacon, but it's not to strong.  And best of all, it has actually crunchy - and some fatty - pieces of bacon in it.  As edible as the bacon shake was, however, I would recommend the Lucky Charms Marshmallow shake first.  I think the bacon shake would need some maple in it to make it a contest.  PV Burger Co are artists.  They have really interesting ideas, and they execute it well.  It could be better, though.  They can't draw people by the quality of their meat alone, like some of the more high-end burger spots.  Drink selection is weak; a place like this really needs to serve some specialty bottled sodas, or at least something besides canned Coke products.  As it stands, though, PV Burger is an excellent neighborhood burger joint, and is probably even worth traveling a few miles out of your way to visit.  The bacon is calling for you.

Coworker and I were talking about pizza, and he found this place on Yelp.  It has great reviews, so we decided to check it out.  The flyer says "New York style brick oven pizza."  I love brick oven pizza, so off we went.  Our first hint that something was amiss was the nondescript location in a beat up strip mall, with "Pizzeria" on the front of the building, and the name of the restaurant painted on the side wall.  Some would say this is charming.  I would submit that charm has a minimum standard.  My second clue should have been that the menu was printed on cheap paper.  I guess this is OK for a New York style place; that sort of thing wouldn't be too out of place for a by-the-slice place in the big apple.  But not for a brick oven pizza joint.  That's OK, though, right?  Because brick oven pizza is delicious, no matter how low rent, right?  The next thing that hit me at this brick oven pizza restaurant - get ready for this - THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A BRICK OVEN.  What a novel idea - a brick oven pizza restaurant without a brick oven!  There it was on the menu: "New York style brick oven pizza."  Yet the oven they were using had no bricks, no wood... No, sir, it was most definitely not a brick oven.  Maybe you would argue that it is brick oven STYLE pizza.  That it is not.  It is below-average New York style pizza.  The crust tastes good, brushed with butter and garlic and whatnot, but the slices were so incredibly greasy that the whole thing just became limp.  I lived in New York for awhile, and never once did I ever have New York style pizza that greasy.  I could almost feel my arteries getting jammed.  The sausage was also all wrong.  When you order sausage in NY, you get slices of Italian sausage, and they put more cheese on it before putting it back in the oven.  Here?  Throw on some round things resembling chunks of sausage, no cheese to hold them down, and they all end up on your plate by the time you're done eating.  I want to like an unassuming hole-in-the-wall run by seemingly nice people, but with the false advertising, buckets of grease, and completely missing the mark on that whole New York style thing, I just can't see myself ever going back.  At least the price was reasonable.

Phoenix has a dearth of good music venues.  When Crescent Ballroom opened up, I heard great things.  I finally had the opportunity to see a show there.  My first impression was great.  There is seating in the back if you need to rest, the place is intimate, the acoustics seemed good... In fact, it was great until people started showing up.  The problem with Crescent is the scene.  If you want to hang out and chat (loudly) with a bunch of hipsters, it's probably the place for you.  If, however, you are there to actually listen to a live band, good luck hearing the slow songs over all the chatter.  The parking situation is also pretty annoying.  You really do need exact change, and there's no other obvious place to park nearby with an actual parking attendant.  In all fairness, it's really a decent little venue.  The live music is just unfortunately secondary to the social scene.

We went here for lunch a couple weeks ago, wanting to try some place nice, but better than the slightly overrated Corbin's.  The first things that impressed me with this place was the extensive patio.  Probably one of the better ones around, for sure.  We went inside, and initially sat down at the booth in the middle of the room... Which was so cramped that we decided to switch to a regular table.    The ambiance is very nice here; it's difficult not to hang out a little bit after the meal.  The menu is excellent, with some creative pizzas, soups, bruschettas, and a bunch of drinks.  I always like it when a place offers creative non-alcoholic beverages, and they scored some points with their lemonade mojito and their "Tiger Woods" (hibiscus/lemonade).  I had the soup of the day, which was a butternut squash soup with pancetta.  This soup was amazing.  If butternut squash soup itself is not amazing enough by itself, they decided to go and add pancetta.  The soup was nice and creamy, just the way I like it.  As far as pizza is concerned, theirs is good, but not great.  I had the original tart flambee, which sounded awesome.  It turned out to be not quite as awesome as I had hoped, with toppings a little too sparse, and a crust that a little too closely resembled a cracker in texture.  It wasn't bad, but you can definitely find a better pie in the Valley for the same price.  Timo is certainly a good neighborhood restaurant, and possibly one of the best in the area.  Addendum: Went back a 2nd time and had one of the flatbread pizzas, and it was actually respectable.  Much better crust.  Make sure you get one of the flatbread pizzas, and not the thin crust.

On a Friday night with nothing else going on, we decided to try a new place in our quest to find the best pizza in Phoenix.  LAMP is a little out of the way in North Scottsdale, but it looked good.  It was a little more crowded than I expected, and after 15 minutes or so, we were able to get a table.  LAMP is a mid sized venue with an upscale feel (the area is fairly insulated from any normal working class neighborhoods), with a very open food preparation area, as wood-fired pizza restaurants tend to be.  I went with the Gem (red pizza with sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, garlic, and oregano), and my friend had the Geppetto (white pizza with sausage, gorgonzola, and caramelized onion marmelade).  According to the menu, all of their sausage comes from the fantastic De Falco's Italian Deli in south Scottsdale.  The crust was excellent, and I really liked my pie.  Often when I get pepperoni on a pizza, the flavor overwhelms all the other ingredients and completely ruins it (I'm reminded of the terrible pie I had at LGO).  On this one, it was just right.  The sauce was delicious as well.  I tried the white pie, and I didn't like it as much.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't seem that special.  Also tried the ricotta cheesecake for dessert, and it was delectable.  I think I really like this concept of using ricotta instead of cream cheese.  Don't get me wrong, I like a good chunky New York cheesecake, but I guess the Italians do it better.  My biggest complaint about LAMP is the dining experience - the place does feel a bit cold and pretentious.  It probably goes with the North Scottsdale territory, but it lacks the welcoming air that Phoenix's smaller pizza restaurants enjoy.

I love Jamaican food.  Caribbean food in general is one of my favorite cuisines.  Some of the best meals I have had were home-cooked by Jamaicans, Puerto Ricans, Trinidadians, and Guayanans.  Unfortunately, Phoenix is nearly bereft of cuisine from this part of the world.  For Jamaican food, you really have the upscale, and barely authentic, breadfruit, the hole-in-the-wall at Mill and Baseline that may not even be open anymore, and now Jerk Hut.  Jerk Hut is easily the best yet.  To say this place is unassuming is an understatement.  Its dinghy facade is not the most inviting exterior you have seen, but don't worry, the people inside are really friendly.  The way this place works is you pick which main course you want (from a menu that changes regularly), and whether you want steamed cabbage and rice and peas on the side.  Sometimes if you're lucky, they'll also have plantains.  I have been here three times, and have had the curry goat, fricassee chicken, and jerk chicken.  All are delicious; you can't go wrong with any of these.  If you haven't had curry goat, try it.  If they have the fricassee chicken, try it.  Really, it's all delicious.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try their ox tail yet; they said they have had a difficult time getting a reliable supply.  It's OK, since they always have the curry goat, curry chicken, and jerk chicken, so the trip will never be a waste - but maybe one day I'll arrive and be pleasantly surprised with delicious ox tail.  For beverages, they have cola champagne and Jamaican ginger beer, which are a must to accompany a good island meal.  Unfortunately no sorrel.  Jerk Hut is great food, and a lovable hole-in-the-wall local ethnic restaurant.  Quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in town.

I wandered in here last week, late on a Friday evening, and found the place almost deserted.  Bill greeted me at the door, I asked if I could have a meal, and he sat me down at the bar.  Almost immediately I was impressed by the hospitality.  I looked at the menu, which is just a sheet of paper with drinks on one side, and pizzas, salads, desserts, and antipasti on the other, and found it promising.  Why?  Not because it was extensive, but rather because it was limited.  I like a place that just does a couple of things, and does those things well.  Each day there is a different pizza of the day, salad of the day, and I think antipasti of the day.  My first visit, I went with a split pizza--half Maria (pesto, garlic, and tomato) and half Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig, maybe something else)--along with a Boylan's root beer.  The root beer turned out to actually be a Boylan's Creamy Red Birch Beer (Bill said he promises his customers this is the best root beer they'll ever have.  It's partially true, in that it's better than many root beers, but it's technically not a root beer. Get it anyways.), which was actually a nice surprise. (Boylan's Birch Beer would be even better...)  I liked the Maria, but I LOVED the Biaggia.  This was a very good pie, and based on the other reviews here, it possibly could be considered their signature pie.  On my second visit, a week later, I had the Dona, a red pizza with tomatoes and pancetta.  The pancetta was nice and crispy, and of course, delicious.  They also serve you olives while you wait; these were some of the best olives I've had.  I couldn't stop eating them.  They actually tasted fresh (well...as fresh as an olive can get, considering you have to basically wipe out their original bitter flavor when you cure them).  The best part about this restaurant is that it has the feel of a small neighborhood restaurant.  It gets busy during the dinner rush, but if you come a little later, it'll be more relaxed, and you can actually strike up a conversation with the staff.  Good pie, excellent establishment.

Five Guys... What cannot be said about this place?  I stumbled upon it last October in Saratoga Springs, NY, where we decided to eat at Chipotle for lack of anything else recognizable.  I saw the Five Guys next door, and decided to try it out instead of having another bland Chipotle burrito.  Needless to say, when I ran into another Five Guys in Ithaca two days later, I knew I had to eat there for lunch.  Since they opened here in the Valley a month or so ago, I've had to restrain myself.  If it weren't for the guaranteed heart attack that would occur were I to dine at Five Guys twice a day, I think I would probably do so.    I should point out that, before I ate at Five Guys, In-N-Out was my favorite fast food burger joint.  But the food at Five Guys is simply superior.  The burgers are tastier and have more options, and the fries are an order of magnitude better.    The only issue I have with this place is that the price is admittedly steep, but when you consider how much food you get, it's not too unreasonable.  If you stick to the Little Hamburger, which is still probably more filling than a normal fast food burger, you could probably get a meal for inside $8, but that meal will still be more substantial than a normal $6 fast food burger meal.  On the upside, however, the price might have the fortunate side effect of discouraging rowdy kids who could care less about the quality of their burger.

I think I have eaten here probably a gazillion times since I first decided to try it out this summer. It's not very often I get hankerings for the food at one restaurant which can't be satisfied anywhere else on Earth (I used to get that with Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles, until they realized that most middle-class white people have no palates, and the quality started slipping).  If you bothered to read the above parenthetical remark, you'll note that I am not even a vegan. I'd *like* to be a vegan, because large scale farming processes are usually inhumane, but it's just hard to find the wide variety of culinary experience I enjoy when completely excluding animal products from my diet. That's why Desert Roots is so great: their food just tastes great. It's unique. And you're not going to get the same meal twice. Even if I didn't *want* to be vegan, I'd still eat here as often as I can.  The way the place works is as follows: 1) You walk in the door, and look at the items available for the day. 2) You go with the wrap-of-the-day, because it's going to be awesome, unless you're that person who inexplicably hated the wrap, yet her only other review was glowing praise of the super-shitty Green. 3) You nearly go mad because you're too indecisive to pick which other two items you want out of the four or five sides that look totally delicious. And you want the hummous too! Aargh! 4) You enjoy the hell out of your meal.  That's really all there is to it. This is just well-seasoned, fresh, home-grown food that's not gimmicky, not oversauced, and not something you'll easily find in any other restaurant.

It's difficult to find an American restaurant anymore where you are expected to trust the chef.  It's usually pick an entree and pick a side.  Rusconi's is one of those establishments where the chef does not just craft each dish; Rusconi actually pairs the entree with the sides.  This is refreshing.  Take, for example, the first meal I had there: the pork osso buco.  It is served with prickly pear-braised red cabbage, grilled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  If you don't like those sides, you don't deserve to eat the pork osso buco.  That's really all there is to it.  That may sound harsh, but that is how art should be. (To be fair, I don't know if Rusconi does substitutions.  I was never churlish enough to ask.)  I have also had the Durham Ranch Buffalo Sirloin and the Rack of Lamb.  Both were cooked perfectly.  One thing I should note about this place is it's not for the person who wants to leave stuffed.  The portions are not huge, but they are satisfying.  This is how restaurants should be; overeating is one of the biggest public health issues we face as a society.  Thank you Chef Rusconi for doing your part to fix this.  I love that I can still go for a run after eating dinner here.

I've been here four times now, and every time, the service has been absolutely terrible. There are different levels of bad service, but I think "server sitting at a table with her friend for 10-15 minutes" is pretty close to the top.  Send just 1 server out to the patio when there are 50 people out there? That's the Handlebar way!

I'm gonna say what we're all thinking - anybody who goes to an Indian restaurant expecting good service is an idiot. Docking an Indian restaurant for having poor service is like giving an India Pale Ale poor reviews because it doesn't have a very strong malt profile.  With that said, Chennai Chettinaad is the second best Indian buffet I have found in Phoenix. The food is flavorful and spicy, they have plenty of options both for the omnivores and vegetarians, and they have those nice crispy things whose name I'm sure my Indian colleagues told me but I forgot. Also, their gulab jaman is fantastic. I love finishing off a meal with a pair of warm, moist balls.  Notice it's the pampered white people giving them poor reviews, and slagging them off for their poor service?  I'm here to tell you that this place has all the aromatic dishes and the poor service you should expect from a good Indian buffet.

When you enjoy your faux-Napoletana pizza with cardboard-thin cracker crust and a faint drizzling of sauce, do you like to do so in a dining room with walls of plastic bricks and populated with boisterous children?  If so, you'll love Ciao Grazie.  We came here because we were going to be in the neighborhood anyways, and this place for some reason has mostly good reviews.  If only we knew the people who had eaten here are the same sorts who actually think Sauce makes a good pizza.  The meal started out OK.  The service was adequately warm, even if the over-the-top decor left it a little cold (it's OK for a restaurant to be unassuming - really, it is!).  The garlic bread was edible, even if it was just a piece of flatbread with butter and garlic salt on it.  Would have preferred actual garlic, though.  The pizza?  I went with the capricciosa, and my friend had the sofia.  When our tostadas... I mean pizzas... arrived, the unfortunate lack of substance in the crust was readily apparent.  The cornicione was almost nonexistent.  I have said it before, and hopefully I don't have to say it too many more times, but if you think the cracker crust is good, you're absolutely wrong.  There are certain propositions that are not open to different opinions, and this is one of them.  Furthermore, the toppings, besides the olives, were pretty lame.  The prosciutto on my friend's sofia was barely distinguishable from normal ham.  Ciao Grazie is all style and no substance, and the thin, lifeless crust serves as the perfect microcosm for the place itself.  If you like to eat that garbage, just go to Sauce, it's cheaper.  If you don't, do yourself a favor and go a few miles down the road to the far superior (and understandably more crowded) LAMP Pizzeria.

There's one sure-fire way to get me into a restaurant, and that is to serve a lamb burger.  On the red meat scale, lamb may not rate as highly as elk or venison, but it certainly beats out boring old beef.  Want a way to give your boring hamburgers a little bounce?  Make it out of lamb.  So, of course, I had to try this place out.  I arrived during the peak of the Saturday dinner rush (either that or this place is doing very, very well), and sat at the bar.  This gave me a perfect vantage point to view all the goings-on - the drink preparation, the hustle and bustle in a fast-moving kitchen, all the pomp and pretense of the well-to-do north Scottsdale crowd.  This is clearly the most happening evening spot in the immediate vicinity.  When my juicy, medium-rare lamb burger and duck fat fries arrived in front of me, I immediately transformed into a vulture.  I drooled over my plate, my sensibilities comprised of satisfaction laced with empathy for my fallen prey.  It would be impossible to portray the restraint it took to pace myself.  I wanted to savor it, but I could not wait for the next bite.  As the juices from the impeccably cooked ground lamb splashed upon my plate, adding an extra level to the flavor profile of my duck fat fries, I reflected on the handful of lamb burgers I had previously enjoyed.  This one was definitely one of the best, if not the very best.  It may even beat out that excellent lamb burger I had in Portland.  I will admit, I have only eaten at Salty Sow but once, and it may seem premature to declare a verdict on a place after one visit.  But one a place serves up such an excellent lamb burger, and there aren't any glaring problems with the dining experience, it deserves credit.  This place is worth a visit or five.

From the same folks who brought us Timo just up the street from here, we now how Spoke & Wheel.  I didn't know about this place until last week, and decided to give it a try for lunch.  The exterior is unassuming, but the space inside is clean and spacious.  I like the menu.  Sure, they're $9, but they do have Sonoran Dogs (comes with a side).  Not sure how authentic they are.  They have a fair selection of burgers and sandwiches.  I went with the black truffle burger, which was tasty, and possibly one of the best burgers I have had in Phoenix.  The parmesan garlic fries are excellent as well.    I also really liked how they had several specialty sodas.  I had the ginger hibiscus soda, but I would like to try them all.  I wish more restaurants offered something better than water or crappy fountain drinks for those who want something non-alcoholic.  And all day happy hour if you come on your bicycle?  I don't even ride, but that's pretty awesome.  Spoke & Wheel has good food, and it's a nice, relaxed place to hang out.  Another excellent spot in the North Central neighborhood.

Remember when Pomo used to occupy that touristy faux-Mediterranean space in the most upscale part of Scottsdale?  They served one of the best Napoletana pizzas I have ever had in one of the most pretentious, snooty atmospheres imaginable.  I am thrilled to report that my experience with the downtown Pomo was not at all the same.  Having just walked from Cibo, where we enjoyed a decent pie (I'm still not convinced that Cibo comes anywhere close to its level of hype), we stepped into Pomo, expecting to be lambasted with stucco, fake accents, and photos of Florence.  Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be... trendy?  That's right, it was modern decor, and the waitstaff was of the hipster variety.  Wow, that was unexpected!  My biggest problem with the original store had been taken care of.  This was turning out to be an excellent dining experience.  We then ordered our pie, expecting the same quality we had enjoyed from the old Scottsdale oven.  Nope.  What happened?  The pizza was not adequately soupy.  It lacked the amazing flavor and attention to detail that made it somewhat worthwhile to brave Scottsdale's most self-absorbed patrons.  In short, it was underwhelming.   After we left here, we proceeded to walk right down the street to La Piazza Locale (also VPN certified), for our third and best pie of the evening.  I suggest you do the same.  They have the same modern vibe with a much better Napoletana pie.

How much of California's refuse must we take before we finally scream, "That's enough!?"  Really, do we need any more fast food burger joints?  I decided to give this one a shot, because I'm a nice guy, and I figured it should at least be better than In-N-Out.  I need a better burger option in my neck of the woods.  Unfortunately, this does not fit the bill.  First of all, I'm sure their char-grilled meat is great, but it's really hard to taste it behind all that salt.  This may have been the saltiest burger I have tasted since the one I had in Young, AZ, where I'm sure the top of the salt shaker came off when the cook was applying it.  Can you guys try using some real seasonings, or just let quality ingredients speak for themselves?  Maybe you don't HAVE quality ingredients.  I feel sorry for the reviewers who said this burger needs to be more greasy.  The last time I saw something this greasy was at the Jersey shore.  The fries were bland, unless you count salt as a real flavor.  I guess they needed that much salt to force my salivary glands to be productive enough to cut through those moisture-deprived starches from the freezer-aisle fries.  At least this place is better than Burger King.  But Burger King does not make me get out of my car.  If I'm eating a greasy, salty, unhealthy burger, I might as well make my laziness complete and have the burger arrive right at my car door.  I run marathons, I deserve to be able to sit in my car when I get a burger! (Q: How can you tell if someone has run a marathon? A: They'll tell you.)  I'm probably in the minority here... Americans love their salt.  I personally prefer a lower sodium diet that has real flavor and doesn't give me a stomach ache the next morning.

I am always looking for good burger places, and it makes me happy when I find a decent one just a few miles down the road.  My new work-from-home schedule has recently allowed me to try more of the spots in my neighborhood, and I have already visited this one twice.  Possibly the most awesome thing about Hopdoddy is they're all about quality, and that is reflected in something as simple as their fountain drinks.  Coke or Pepsi?  Nope.  They have Maine Root, the purveyors of one of the finest ginger beers around.  Inexplicably, they have pretty much every Maine Root soda besides the ginger brew, but they have other fine offerings besides.  I don't remember which burger I had my first visit, but it was fantastic, and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Next visit, I had the Greek, because I love lamb burgers, but this one tasted too much like a salad for my taste.  Still decent, but not a top-notch lamb burger.  The truffle fries, as well as the regular kennebec fries, are pretty good.  I'm not about to declare this place the best burger joint in the city, but it's definitely worth an occasional visit if you're in the area.

Having opened just a few weeks ago, La Piazza Locale brings the 2nd VPN-certified Neapolitan pizza to downtown Phoenix.  The first thing I thought when I found this place was, "What, don't we have enough excellent pies downtown?"  But we had to try it anyways.  My friend went with Rocco, and I went with the special of the day Don Matteo (smoked butternut squash puree as the sauce, with speck and mozarella).  My first observation was that the crust had the soupiness that a real Napoletana pizza should have.  The crust was perfect.  This is knife-and-fork pizza, and if you think their crust is too soggy, you're wrong.  The smoked butternut was phenomenal.  I'm not sure that's a real authentic ingredient for Neapolitan pizza, but it was probably one of the top three pies I have ever eaten.  My friend's Rocco was pretty good, too, but the Don Matteo was definitely at a whole different level.  My only real complaint about this place was that the music was a little too loud and too trendy.  When dining, I don't like it when the music is too noticeable.  I usually prefer restaurants not to be too trendy, but everything else about the restaurant was great, so I can let this pass.  Locale is now on my short list of best pies in the Valley.  It's not as good as Bianco, but it's top tier.

If there's one thing I can conclude from eating at the Mexican places that are most highly rated on Yelp, it's that white people have very bad taste for Mexican food. With the endless Mexican food options in Phoenix, it is this place and Santos Lucha Libre that are listed in Phoenix's top 5 restaurants. The latter was terrible, but PHX Burrito House seemed promising. Would this be the most disappointing week yet in my still-young Mexican food tour?   Unfortunately, yes.  PHX Burrito House is situated in the former digs of the also-overrated Fry Bread House. I will admit, the idea of burritos in an old converted house is pretty cool (maybe that's why this place has such rave reviews?). I looked at the menu, and it was sparse. Great! A place like this should have a sparse menu.  The list of ingredients in the burrito, however, concerned me a little bit. Rice, choice of pinto or black beans, meat, sour cream. Guacamole extra. What? Rice? Really?  I trudged ahead anyways. Got the carne asada burrito with guac. With a bottle of Fanta (no Jarritos?).  Almost $11.  Everything was just OK. The chips were OK. The burrito was just OK. Sorry, but it's hard to get excited about a burrito where 50% of the mass is rice and 40% is beans. I think there was a piece of actual carne asada in every third bite. Guac was relegated to a little vein near the outside of the burrito. Sour cream was only noticeable when I got to the bottom, where all the liquids inevitably end up.  It's pretty disappointing when I leave a place with the feeling that I could have gotten a better burrito at Filiberto's.  I've probably said this before, but if you want a sure-fire way to ruin a burrito, put a crap ton of rice in it. It's just filler. Would I eat here if I live in there area? Maybe.. But probably not, there's a Filiberto's across the street, and if I want a bad burrito, I might as well only spend four bucks on it.

For the past few weeks, I have been on something of a "taco tour" of north central Phoenix. Santos Lucha Libre earned itself a stop on account of its (a) being listed as one of the highest-rated restaurants in Phoenix and (b) only being ten minutes away from work.  I'm not sure what I was expecting other than just great tasting, authentic Mexican street food. What I was certainly not expecting was a setup basically like Chipotle, where you tell the person behind the counter which meats you want, what you want on the tacos, etc. If you think this is how food should be prepared, you're wrong. Sorry, but you're just wrong.  Anyways, resigned to the fact that I would be forced to make game time decisions about whether I wanted lettuce, onions, sour cream, and/or guacamole, I ended up getting a few different varieties of meat on my street tacos.   Now, I'm not going to pretend that this was a bad meal. Was it disgusting? Nope. It was just average. The meat was average, the tortillas were average, the salsa bar was average... Everything was average. But it was presented in a way that makes white people who like the slop they serve at Chipotle think they're onto something special. It's like a better Chipotle, and that's not a compliment.  If you're offering authentic Mexican food, there should be more meat options besides boring beef, chicken, and pork. Where's the lengua and chorizo? If you want hole-in-the-wall food, go to a real hole-in-the-wall... And if you want fancy tacos, there are much better places to get fancy tacos.  There's really just no reason to eat here. Not when there are countless hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants in this part of town. Not when it's just a block down the street from Los Reyes de la Torta. Not when I have to drive right by the far superior Paquime to get there.

"Street food" is my favorite kind of Mexican food. There's nothing more awesome than the cheap, simple, bite-sized tacos you buy at a roadside stand in Mexico or Tucson (an extension of Mexico). Phoenix has its share of roadside stands...but they ain't no Tucson or Mexico. Awesome dirty hole-in-the-wall places where employees don't speak English? Phoenix has tons, and they are great.  Tortas Paquime is a chain of five or so small restaurants focusing mainly on the torta. I didn't realize it growing up, but Mexicans know how to make an awesome sandwich. Honestly, the only sandwiches I get really excited about in any global cuisine is the torta. "Street Food of Mexico" is a new concept from Tortas Paquime - a clean, fast/casual restaurant that sells street tacos, tortas, aguas, and other offerings typically found at out of the way restaurants in low-rent buildings.  The food is really pretty good. I had the hot dog, which is not as good as the Sonoran hot dogs found in Tucson, but respectable in its own way, and the Rib Eye tacos. The tacos were simple enough that they can almost be considered real, bonified street tacos, with the meat being the main ingredient, and some avocado thrown in just to make it more awesome. Actually, they kind of straddle the line between street tacos and fancy tacos.  The cucumber agua is superb. They also had horchata and jamaica, and while I love me some horchata and jamaica, it's hard to pass up on cucumber agua. I never see that!  Paquime does sacrifice a little bit of authenticity so as to make white people feel a little more comfortable. There's not necessarily anything wrong with that - the spirit of Mexican street food is still alive in this food, even if it is served amid the bland, yuppie decor typically associated with worthless faux-Mexican schlock like Chipotle and Cafe Rio.  This is a quality addition to the Sunnyslope area. There are definitely better, more authentic Mexican places in the area, but this is not a bad concept at all, and it's executed pretty well.

Before the fateful day in late March when Tacos Atoyac shut down, I lamented mostly the loss of their excellent fish tacos. Some of their other tacos weren't the best I've had, but they had the best fish tacos anywhere. So when I heard they had opened back up, of course I was excited.  My return visit came with some trepidation, of course. I heard Dan was no longer involved, and Dan was part of the experience.  The food should be the same, right? Same menu, same prices.  I got a smattering of what I consider the best offerings the previous incarnation offered: two fish tacos, a quesadilla with lengua, and the churro.  The quality of the tacos did not decline at all. I could've sworn they used to have more fish in them, however. Was I just imagining things? I don't know, it's hard to quantitatively compare something to a mere fading memory. But the fish tacos are still undoubtedly good.  The quesadillas, however, provided considerably more insight. Atoyac v1 quesadillas were packed with meat and cheese - so much that if you get the lengua quesadillas, you have a substantial pool of (delicious) grease sitting at the bottom of the tray. These things were so overflowing that it was sometimes hard to pick them up without the meat falling out.  Now? Barely any cheese OR meat. The meat was actually scattered around the quesadilla, with areas completely devoid of meat! And the cheese was spread extremely thin compared to the old quesadillas.  It's clear that what happened here is what is known as size inflation (as opposed to price inflation).  They raise the price by lowering the portions. And that just makes for worse food - give me the same food at a higher price, if you must.  Apart from the disappointing cheapening of the product, this place also lacks any charm at all without Dan's presence. And that goes a long way, too.

The Vig's lamb belly salad is one of my favorite salads anywhere. Really, the food is pretty good in general here, but that salad... Amazing.  Imagine my surprise when this Wednesday I showed up and they had a new menu sans lamb belly salad. Odd.  I mentioned it to the bartender, and she said the chef took it off the menu because they kept running out of lamb belly.  Now, I suppose I don't have the best business acumen, but isn't it better, from a margin perspective, to always run out of something, than to consistently have leftovers? Isn't that an indication that the lamb belly salad is really popular? Isn't that how you achieve maximal utilization?  I mean, I don't know what it takes to run a restaurant, but I do know this - without the lamb belly salad, the Vig is dead to me.

I just read a Yelp review on this place wherein the author argued with the staff about whether the pizza had fresh mozzarella. I finally had the chance to eat here, and if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be as follows: "There is no way in hell that was fresh mozzarella."  That's really all there is to it.  Honestly, I had high expectations going into this place. I'm a sucker for old buildings that are converted into restaurants. I also like restaurants that are not part of the Sam Fox Galactic Empire. This should have been a slam dunk.  The flatbread crust (how hip of them to call it a flatbread instead of pizza!) has all the depth and texture of a piece of stale pita bread. The sauce was bland. We have already discussed the cheese. This is basically the Peter Piper Pizza of "artisan" pizza.  The oven had a door on it. A door! One cannot cook a pizza in a properly heated oven if it has a door on it.  I'm pretty sure they got their recipes and cooking techniques from an internet forum for Caucasian stay-at-home moms in Middle America.  Besides the mediocrity of the pizza (excuse me, "flatbread"), the other problem I had with this place is that it took about ten minutes before the server/bartender asked me if perhaps I would like some food, or something. Maybe it's the norm for people to come here and not eat. In retrospect, maybe they're onto something.  But hey, it's a cool space! I'll bet Sam Fox is pissed they stole his concept ("mediocre {TYPE OF CUISINE} in a hip space").

If you ate at Tacos Atoyac before it closed in March, you have met Dan Maldonado. If you have eaten at the new version of Atoyac since it reopened, you may have wondered, "What happened to Dan?" Mucho Macho Taco is Dan's new venture.  Of course I was excited to try the new place. I didn't really know what to expect. One thing you should not expect is another Atoyac. You will notice right off the bat that this is a fast casual place, not a hole-in-the-wall. MMT is in a nicer neighborhood, in a nicer building, next door to a French grocery. It is not Oaxacan cuisine like Atoyac. It's not the same food or the same ambiance. I think the only thing the two places have in common is Dan and the horchata.  MMT is, much more so than Atoyac, a taco joint. Here, instead of simple, traditional street tacos with one or two ingredients, you have a whole slew (maybe 15) of taco options with more elaborate, less traditional flavor profiles. Brisket tacos with clementines and grilled onions. Bacon tacos with pico de gallo and cream (yes, bacon tacos. It's as delicious as it sounds). Vegetarian tacos, 50/50 (chorizo/beef) tacos, chicken tacos, asado, grilled fish, Baja fried fish, shrimp... These are tacos that pay homage to traditional street tacos, but are modern and creative.  This is what a fast casual taco restaurant should be. There are certain aspects of Atoyac that I miss - its fish tacos and non-taco offerings - but if you're specifically looking for awesome tacos, Mucho Macho is far superior.

With the severe glut of slightly-above-mediocre burger places popping up in the last five years, it's really hard to think of a reason why this place should exist. I was no fan of Indulge Burger, but it's surprising that they didn't make it, yet Burgers N Fries is still going in the same location.  The burgers? Well, they're not that great. They're a little better than a normal fast food burger, but not anywhere near what I would expect for the $8-9 I paid. The bacon was indistinguishable from what you might find on a Wendy's double stack (thin and floppy). By the way, that bacon, and pretty much any other topping you might want to add outside of the standard lettuce and tomatoes, will cost you a couple bucks. That adds up *really* quickly.  The fries are... well, kinda decent. But kinda decent fries is not enough to establish a raison d'etre.  Honestly, I'd rather go to Five Guys. Sadly, Five Guys makes a better burger, and I never leave hungry. I did like that they had custard, if this place were called "Frozen Custard" instead of "Burgers N Fries," it might be more worthwhile. Unfortunately, I was already at about $11 for just a burger and fries, and didn't want to drop another $6 on custard.

I used to visit the old location regularly when I worked in Tempe. Now, after a 2+ year absence, I'm back in Tempe, and figured I had to give the new location a shot.  The valet parking captures the whole experience without your ever having to set foot in the door. Valet parking at a soul food restaurant? It's a contradiction.  Basically, they Scottsdalified what used to be a welcoming, soulful restaurant with good food and friendly, spunky service. It used to take me minutes to get my food even when the place was packed; now it took forever with a half-empty restaurant. The staff? No charm whatsoever. It's just the same cold, stale trendy restaurant you expect anywhere else in Scottsdale.  And the food isn't even as good anymore.  Thanks for ruining a good thing, Lo Lo's.

The lady who said the brisket is "tough, flavorless, and dry" is mistaken; she apparently meant to review the paper towels on the tables. The brisket is fantastic.  The pulled pork was a little too juicy for my taste. I prefer my pulled pork not to be steeped in grease, but some may disagree. Tasted OK, but not my favorite pulled pork by any stretch.  The sides were a little pedestrian.  Definitely planning on coming back and trying the other meats, and having more of the paper towels.

It's trying to be The Yard. And The Yard sucks.  The only saving grace is the food is not bad - unlike the service, which is terrible.

It seems like they can't decide what kind of restaurant to try here. First it was Notorious Burgers, then Notorious Kitchen (which was basically the same as the burger place), and now it's Hog and Hops (some of the burgers remain, but now there's BBQ).  I really don't know what other people have been reviewing. I got the platter with brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork was average, but the brisket was damn near inedible. No flavor, and incredibly dry. Without sauce, it's like eating a napkin. If you need sauce on your brisket, you're doing it wrong.  Really, it was possibly the worst brisket I have had. I should've known, since there's obviously not an outdoor smoker near the premises.  If the burgers are unchanged from the previous iteration, that's a fine meal right there. But they need to learn to cook barbecue before they try to start selling barbecue.
