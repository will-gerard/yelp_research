I've been eating here for years... they have a great lunch menu, friendly service, and they get the food out fast! If you go during dinner time, try their garlic chicken wings... YUM.

This place is an absolute gem! I so wish we had one in Portland! The vegan wings are so so so so so so so good! You have to try them.. wing lovers will unite on this sensational menu item. We also tried two of the bowls...both of which are outstanding. If you're looking for a great vegan, gluten free joint... that's casual and tasty.. this is so your place.

Love this place, it's such a hidden gem in Phoenix. Take the dogs, kids and a picnic blanket to hang out on the lawn under the trees after you're done eating a tasty brunch in the cooler months. Love that they've kept a simple menu and just focused on honoring their beautiful space in the middle of the city.

Service was wonderful! and the sushi was outstanding.. a great little spot to grab an authentic Japanese bite.

This was pretty gross. We ordered take out and everything tasted like it came directly from Panda Express. Two of the items we ordered tasted EXACTLY the same, even though they were entirely different dishes. We won't be returning. Keep Looking.

Always a fan of Pita J.. I like this location since they seem to be very family friendly and still great quality food and funky vibe...with little less of the attitude that comes with some of the other locations. :)

Just Horrible. Save yourself the trip and stay away. The food was slow, mediocre, and we (along with others it appeared) received absolutely horrendous service by every single staff member there, including the manager. We stopped in for a "quick" bite with our kids, when we tried to put an order in after our server finally showed up having already been waiting for over 15 min at a table, the appetizer never came.... we waited another 10-15 min to receive waters, and then finally had the opportunity to order our meal only to wait another 45min for the incomplete food order.... The completely ineffectual manager awkwardly came to apologize for our crappy experience... only he never actually did apologize.... He gave an excuse of being understaffed, which might explain the slow service, but not the poor attitude  from the nearly non-existent service. This place is a waste of an amazing location. I feel robbed of my time and my money, I will not be back, and I will tell pretty much everyone to stay away. Like all the places before it.... this one appears to be another bust.
