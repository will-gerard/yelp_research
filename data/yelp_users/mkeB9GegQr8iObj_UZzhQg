Stayed here for a bit before finding a place to rent out. It is a quiet spot with clean rooms. Wifi was a little slow as they want you to upgrade to the better package but it works to check Yelp, Facebook and email.  The breakfast was tasty, though nothing special. You have muffins, oatmeal, granola bars and coffee. For the price of the room, I am more than happy with that breakfast. Staff was always very nice to me. In all it is a pretty good stay and I would go back if I needed to. It is in a very central location and easy to get to on or off the freeway.

I stopped by this weekend and this place is a race car lover's paradise. Yes it is small but it is free. Brought my kid along and he loved it. Thought it was really cool to see the different race cars and he loved it even more when I told him the story behind a few of them. Yes I needed the plaques to tell me that story but still.  If you are out in the area or can make a day of activities out in that part of Scottsdale I highly suggest checking out this museum. It will bring out the kid in you.

I've always held a special place in my heart for Cheba Hut. It was definitely a college staple. Who would want a full "Blunt" of "The Kind?" Yes, it may have a little of the pothead culture to the place but that adds to the appeal.   The sandwiches are baked, which really brings out the flavor of the meat and cheese. The toppings are always fresh and delicious. Who doesn't like that they have Kool-Aid on their drink menu?   Cheba is definitely a spot I love to hit every time I am in Tempe. The atmosphere is great and the staff is really laid back. Who'd a thunk? If you are looking for a good place to get a great sandwich, definitely check this place out. So much better than the chain stores out there.

Another ASU staple. The place is actually a lot of fun, especially with a group of people. The drinks flow in abundance and I had their nachos on my last trip. So good. They had the right amount of cheese and toppings on them. Everything looked so delicious. Dang, now I am getting hungry just thinking about the nachos.

So this place is expensive but, in this instance, you get what you pay for.  Really with a name like Bobby Flay backing the place, you have high expectations. The burger I had was spectacular. Cooked just right and the grilled Vidalia onions added a special sweetness.  I had a taste of the salmon and it was great! (I do not like fish)  My favorite part was the bread basket they delivered. The jalapeno bread was by far my favorite but the corn bread muffin held its own. Have a special occasion or a little extra money burning a hole in your pocket? Go here.  Better yet, take some of that money you would be wasting in the casino and get yourself something good.

Great spot right off of Mill. Went for lunch with some co-workers and the place wasn't too loud. Food was great.   Not only is the food selection great but the drinks menu is huge as well. Definitely give them a look if you are in the area and are thirsty/hungry or both!  Also they usually have brats and beer on game day.

Figured I would give this ASU staple a quick review.   The sandwiches are fresh and interesting. They always have a new taste to try out. Yes they do work on sandwiches as an art form. The location is great if you go to or work at ASU or its surroundings. Free cookie with the meal? Definitely a nice bonus. Every sandwich I have tried here has been good, even the egg salad!  I really only wish it wasn't going away soon. I will eat there until they are gone though!

Having lived in many cold weather climates throughout my years I have come to a realization, I am not a fan of shoveling snow. Seriously, who wants to do that? You start at one end of your property and by the time you finish you have to start all over again!   Yeah, shorts on Christmas is a nice bonus too. Seriously, Phoenix in the winter is the bees knees.

I've always liked Jersey Mike's. There is something about a "wet" sub that intrigues me. Whenever I go I get it Mike's Way.  The service is really good too. I like that they slice the meat and cheese there (even if the turkey doesn't naturally come in a log shape) as it makes me feel like it is just a little fresher than the other guys.  Definitely give it a go.

For a Jack in the Box, this place is dirty. Yes that is saying a lot. It seems to be a hang out for downtown Tempe's transient population but I guess they cannot kick out the paying customers.   The service seemed a little slower than most locations but that could have been the decorum in the building that made me feel that way. The food is standard Jack in the Box fare, so at least you know what you are getting into. I just wouldn't step into the bathroom there if I were you.

Went in because they have gluten free pizza and those that needed it were impressed. I on the other hand prefer my pizza with extra gluten and I really enjoyed it. The crust is nice and crisp and the toppings are plentiful.   They have an area where the kids congregate so I would stay away from there unless you have kids with you or like watching parents let their kids roam free.   The pizza is good though so stay away from the kids area and you are good.

Yeah I guess you get what you pay for but this place should really be free.   To start off, the rooms are disgusting. My non-smoking room had cigarette burns all over the bed spread, the shower screamed "wear sandals or get a nasty fungus," and there were dead ants all over the counter.   The staff was not helpful at all. My TV wasn't working so I called the front desk. I was told they probably wouldn't get to it. At least they were honest.   The "complimentary breakfast" was coffee, though I probably wouldn't have trusted whatever they would have had for food anyways.  Apparently they are doing renovations to the rooms. Though it seems they only do renovations at 11 at night. I heard banging as beds were being removed from rooms and the workers singing. Probably wouldn't have cared had they singing been a lullaby but it wasn't.  In the end I probably should have charged them for my extermination services. I killed countless roaches in the room. Yep, roaches. I felt dirtier staying there than had I gone camping. In fact, if you need to save some money but need a place to stay I would recommend sleeping in your car in the Wal-Mart parking lot before staying at this "hotel."   Needless to say, I won't be back. The Wyndham Group should be ashamed to call this one of their properties.

Love having the food trucks close to campus. It is a great use of the empty lot and a nice convenience for those who are at ASU. Though check back with me in July to see if I feel the same about melting while eating my food.

The tacos were great. Reminded me of the street tacos you can get... just without the unintended consequences that usually follows. I also got a quesadilla and it was good, though I think it would be difficult to screw up a cheese quesadilla. The salsa bar was nice and even had some guacamole.  The patio area is nice, even in the summer. I think misters were probably god's gift to Phoenix for making this land so unbearably hot.   I will definitely go back as everything I had was excellent.

Really good sports bar. Had a "meeting" here one night and it wasn't too crowded during the week. Service was good and prices were also pretty good. I hear the lunch specials are great so I definitely need to make it back soon.  Check it out if you are in the area. One nice thing about this part of Tempe is there is no shortage of good bars.
