Wow such a great experience. Granted at first I was upset due to not being given napkins and initially I asked for the smallest shake and ended up with a small which was $3 but regardless the manager Jeff saw me looking for napkins immediately helped me and refunded me the difference of a mini versus a small. Little things go a long way :)

Lisa is absolutely amazing !! I only had a deep condition treatment and haircut but I have never had a stylist actually cut my hair right the first time until I saw her, not only did she do a perfect job she didn't make me feel bad about my dry hair, instead she said my hair was thirsty and offered the deep conditioning which NO ONE has ever said or done! she is the cutest sweetest stylist I have met and I may even drive the 40+ Mins from Scottsdale just to see her from now on!

Worse experience EVER. Not only did the aesthetician scar my face and not inform me, all I was offered was a refund and one free micro and upon further research Peels are more beneficial to aid in healing. Furthermore they informed me I would receive a FULL refund of $72 or so however I received $20 and to top that off they would not accommodate me in where the service was performed I had to drive TWICE to lone mountain which was a 45 drive one way for an eval and consult with their "top" aesthetician. And on top of all that I got laid off from my job and I drive a lease. Don't waste your time here. They are liars and all they care about is $.

Only because of the disrespectful unprofessional manager kyle. I was threatened by this boy. UNACCEPTABLE. i will file a formal complaint. Everyone else is fabulous. He abuses steroids percocets and drugs ON THE JOB. ABSOLUTELY NOT OKAY.

I am so very happy and grateful for all the wonderful staff that works here. You can tell everyone that works here really do enjoy their work and this is the first place I have been to that actually remembers me by name!! Allison is simply fantastic, I have never met a more caring, sweet, nice, thoughtful Nurse Practioner in my life; although, I do really like Susan as well. Who knew that these two could make getting six injections twice a week enjoyable! Kristi is also a wonderful addition to the team, I enjoy our conversations and the stretches she has taught me to help alleviate some of my pain. Overall this place actually addresses the deep underlying issues and provide therapy that truly works. I have had chronic headaches for years and I have finally found the cure. I would recommend this office to anybody who needs quality pain management or care.

Irate with this location. I'm unemployed and they refused to wax due to potential retin a products I used for one day. Furthermore charged me $18 for tweezing my eye brows wth??!!! Unacceptable and unprofessional I can tweeZe my eye brows for free. Safe to say I will never step foot in one again and to top it off they're pushy with sales, I don't have income!!! How can you not understand that?? Filing a complaint with BBB. Over charge their services and it isn't worth it.
