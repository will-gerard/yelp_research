Having seen the restaurant on MVF, I knew I had to make it a stop if I ever got to Vegas.  I spent the last week there for a family gathering, and kept trying to find some time to break away to get there.  I told my wife that we WOULD be going on our way out of town.  We got there at about 10 am on a Thursday.  We walked right in and there was no wait to be seated.  The ambiance is cool, and everything seems like it was well thought out.  It was clean, and the staff was very friendly.  I ordered the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.  All I can really say is, do it.  Eat this magnificent blend of flavors and textures.  Come hungry, it's a beast... but you will leave with a smile.  The fried chicken is juicy, firm, and the breading is light and subtle.  The hint of sage really adds a lot.  It might be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten... but that's a tough call.  The griddle mashed potatoes are excellent.  They get the texture perfect, and they are just the right amount of salt.  The chipotle sauce on the top is great also.  My wife had the meatloaf and eggs breakfast.  The meatloaf was delicious.  It was not mushy or runny or falling apart.  It was a firm patty, neatly grilled to a delicious brown crust.  Served with the griddle mashed potatoes, she really enjoyed it.  (And I enjoyed the leftovers.)  What really speaks to the level of service at this place is the experience my mother in law had.  She has celiac, and cannot eat any gluten.  She made her allergy known to our waiter, who took the time to double-check with the chef about what dishes had flour.  She settled on a scramble that had asparagus, pot roast, cheese, tomato, and obviously, egg.  She remarked that the vegetables were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.  Other recommendation:  Get a S'Mores Mocha.  Wow.  Overall - it was worth the wait.  And given that I paid with my craps winnings, it was the right price.  Stop by if you're in Vegas, San Diego, Chicago, or anywhere else they open one of these.  It's worth the time.

I'm going to join the small group of reviewers that wasn't "wow-ed" by this place.  I tried it twice, never wanting to rush to judgment.  My conclusion is, really, that this is a pretty mediocre restaurant.  In our two visits, we experienced over-cooked eggs, under-cooked hash browns, runny hollandaise, and generally bland food.  I am honestly somewhat baffled by the high reviews.  It's not terrible, it's just not worthy of more than two stars.  I will admit this: The servers and staff are very friendly, and probably the only saving grace.  I'd eat here again if it was the only place that didn't have a huge wait, but I'll stick to the Good Egg for now.

I've gotten haircuts now from all three barbers, and they're all exceptional.  This is an awesome haircut by master barbers at the same price as those "discount" hack-joints.  Though I don't partake, they give you beer while  you wait.  There is no other place to go... seriously.  And try their pomade.

I thought I'd update my review since there are some recent negatives.  I'll just keep it simple: If you want a good haircut, with an old skool vibe (a la kustom culture, rockabilly, or nostalgia) - this is your place. If you want a basic haircut from experienced barbers with no frills - this is your place. If you want a beer while you wait - this is your place.  If you want a mediocre "factory" hair cut, done by a talkative, petite lady that won't shut up about her kids, and keeps laughing and gossiping with the 15 other hens in the shop - This is NOT your place.   The barbers aren't the most talkative?  Big deal.  They cut your hair and do a damn fine job.  The more often you go in, the better the hair cut gets.  You have to wait sometimes?  I see that as a good thing, even if it can be frustrating.  It means a quality local business is doing good, and they're likely to be around the next time you need your ears lowered.  And for the community that admires a nice pompadour, that's a must.  It's like this:  Great haircut.  Fair price.  Cool atmosphere.  Leave the latte at home.  Put your cell phone away.  Relax.  'Nuff said.

Clean. Good equipment. No crowds. Surprisingly few bros. A lot of serious lifters here.

Mark's is consistently one of the best restaurants I've eaten at.  I am a semi-regular.  It's pretty simple: If you like eggs benedict this is the place.  My personal favorite is the Irish Eggs Benedict - which is basically corned beef hash re-imagined as a benny.  The fritattas are also fantastic. The strawberry preserves on the table is a nice touch also. Breakfast for two is around 20 bucks.  Support a local business, have a great breakfast, and skip the buyer's remorse so common among Denny's patrons.

Not great. Pretty bland. Food was cold. Hardly anyone here. I'd probably give it another try, but the prices were a bit high for so little flavor.
