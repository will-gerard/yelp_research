Great dive bar, saying that they always have drink and shot specials. Their burgers are above average for a restaurant let alone dive bar food.. I've heard they're patty melt is delicious as well.  Wings are ok, nothing to write home about.  The staff are friendly and will remember your name if you go in a lot and you may even get a free beer from time to time on the house.  They host dodgeball and dart leagues and even dress up and decorate the place when dodgeball have a theme night.  They have craft beers now and will ask us what beers we would like for the upcoming season.. Great dive bar, one of my favorites in Phoenix!  They have two pool tables, plenty of seating, big screen tvs everywhere, a new jukebox, and a dart board.

We waited an hour for our food. The "hot" wings were flavorless and not hot at all; they were so disgusting they tasted like they took the wings from the fridge and dumped them in the fryer, didn't even taste like anything but chicken and oil; I didn't eat them so they were taken off my bill.   The steak and eggs were ordered medium well it came out rare and had to be sent back; they remade them and my friend ate it. (This was her 4th time at the market and said this is the 4th time of having bad service/bad food) her other experience was when the quiche was frozen in the middle.   The beer comes in an 18 oz. glass but is only poured halfway so it feels like they cheat you when you look at the glass when ordering a 12oz. beer, I ordered a bud light which was $5 I don't even want to know how much their craft beers are.    Our waitress was nice but she was overworked and running around to other guests most of the time so our table couldn't ask for anything promptly.   It's just not a place I will ever visit again, and telling friends and family not to even bother.  I have been contacted by a manager about my review and he tries blaming me about our party size (that went from 20 to 8 because everyone backed out due to seeing the menu prices) and that I didn't mentioned that I didn't have to pay for wings, and asked if I could change my 1 star to 4 because I liked the band.   Excuse me, your band has nothing to do with: food prepared wrong, disgusting wings, overpriced menu, and lack of good timely service.   My one star is for the local band, and yelp doesn't allow zero stars.

I USE to love 1130 when the service and managers were courteous and nice. The last trip to 1130 we double dated with new comers because we raved about the food and the service. We have been here at least a half dozen times and ordered the salmon, calamari, steak salad, mimosas, happy hour beers/cocktails, burgers. All great until this past trip. We go here so often I have bought gift certificates through restaurants.com that is $25 off a $50 bill of ALCOHOL+FOOD. So using this certificate was no problem the first time we went; the waiter checked with her manager before we even ordered to make sure it was alcohol+food. Both said it was valid. So I bring in another certificate a month later, and it's a whole new story when the bill comes. This waitress tells us we are not allowed to use it for our drinks, only food. Contradicting themselves from the month previous we used it. Then the manager comes over and I explain to her the situation and they honored our certificate the month before no questions asked, but she insisted in arguing with me for about ten minutes asking who the manager was, whats their name and waitress' name who "approved" this the last time.  After fighting with the he-she, she said she will honor it this time but not the next time with a bad attitude and stormed off.   I have worked years in the food industry and you NEVER argue for any amount of time with the customer. ESPECIALLY if you honored the certificate then change your tune the next visit. I was humiliated in front of our friends we invited out and appalled that the manager had the balls to argue with me for ten minutes. I have another certificate for 1130 and WILL BE THROWING IT OUT, WE WILL NOT BE BACK and told all our friends/family what happened. That is not how you conduct your business if you want to keep customers happy and spreading your praise!    I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.

I am reviewing this Restaurant again, I was contacted by email by the marketing director Amber and she apologized to for the service we had received and offered gift certificates to 1130 or SAMs cafe, I chose SAMs cafe.  SAMs cafe was good, nothing too exciting but the service was excellent. I finally decided to go back to 1130 last month and they have made noticeable changes with their coupon policy. Now everyone understands the coupon and Josh (I believe was our AMAZING waiter) and explained you can use the coupon for alcohol AND food. He was very sure and knowledgeable of the coupon policy, so they seem to have addressed the issue with the entire staff since our last visit which is what a business is suppose to do to improve and draw customers back. They addressed the problem and fixed it, i was surprised.  We ordered the steak salad, calamari, salmon burger, Reuben dip and the flavored ice teas. Everything was cooked well and my parents loved the food and will definitely be back. I am very pleased the 1130 addressed the confusion with the coupons and very grateful for the email from Amber apologizing and offering certificates to make up for our last visit. She went above and beyond to keep a customer, I am very impressed and excited to be able to enjoy the 1130 again.

I've been coming here for almost 4 years now, yes the language barrier is sometimes difficult but the massage is so relaxing I also always fall asleep.  They take ages 5 and up, and you can't beat the price $25 for an hour.  They do suggest a tip but it's up to you, my massage today I tipped $5 when it was posted suggested was $7-10 but my girl didn't massage hard enough when I get a male and he gives deep tissue I will tip $10.  This is my hands down place to go to, they take walk ins and/or appointments if you're booking 2 or more at the same time.  Today I called at 5:45pm and got an appointment for three at 7:30.  I told my nephew we will start having massage day once a month, he loved it (he's 8.)

I stopped in for lunch, based on the reviews I was SO stoked for this burger and "best onion rings" and was disappointed. The burger was OK, like a whopper is ok. And the onion rings were some of the least flavorful I've tasted. I will not be returning for $12 burger, onion rings and drink meal. The soda selection is impressive but that's about it. Too bad I don't drink soda.  The girl at the counter was very pleasant though.  I ordered the afterburner burger, and ate half of it; the sauce was very spicy and that was the highlight of the burger. Eh.

Got a 10 minute free massage at the chandler beer festival last week, they pitched me a Chiropractic package with an evaluation, X-rays, and massage included.. I bought it and then she set me up for an available appointment within the next week, sat at 9:30.  I show up to the Phoenix location at 9:30 to a sign that says "sorry for the inconvenience but we're closed on Thursdays and Saturdays until further notice".  I didn't receive a courtesy call stating this change before I drove all the way down on a Saturday morning, I called the number and requested I get my money back, I'm not doing business with them ever again.  This place is inconsiderate of their clients time.  I better get a refund in a timely manner. Avoid this place.

This office is beyond accommodating, the scheduler works with clients and is always willing to help and work around your schedule. The staff are knowledgable and very personable, they focus on your needs the entire session and give at home exercises and tips as well.  They are encouraging when things are difficult and they make you laugh while your completing your exercises.  I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a physical therapist in central Phoenix.  I visited this office for two months 2-5 a week in 2014.

Ran by two guys who only want your money and don't care about their players.  They allow and condone sexual harassment to take place while in their league and the harasser gets "talked to" about 5+ times and the girl gets told "ignore him, be a big girl" sexual harassment is no joke; but you ask for help and protection from the owners and they ask you not to come back and play. After 6 months asking for help from one owner all you get is ignored calls, but he also takes advantage of girls in his league himself.  The other owner SEES the inappropriate touching with his own eyes and is too weak to protect the MULTIPLE women this man was harassing.  I was forced to take legal action through the superior court to get protection from this guy. I guess we live in a sexist world where men are allowed to touch and harass women and it's ok as long as you "just ignore it."  Update: the state of AZ has found these instances and months of spreading rumors and lies as harassment and a restraining order has been issued. So this harassment should have been taken seriously many months ago, and I have asked over 20 times over a 6 month period to have this guy removed from league without success.   With this new information I still have not received an apology for this harassment not being handled correctly from NDO. Waiting for a call still. They not only allow Men to sexually harass women but they allow sexual harassment from males to other males and think it's funny even when men express they feel uncomfortable. Johnny is guilty of touching men and messaging them inappropriate messages and texts to straight men hence why he loves the owners.  They condone his behavior so of course he's in support of these two men.  Funny how the judge deems these actions harassment in less than an hour and it takes these two men 8 months to do ANYTHING about this situation after being asked weekly to get this creeper removed. So if you want to be harassed by straight men and gay men this is the league for you.  Update: april 2015. STILL have not been contacted from either owner about sexual assault, I guess ignoring the judges order against sexual harassment makes them feel better about ignoring it.  Out of sight out of mind is NDO's motto. Great way to run a business... When any marketing tip is NOT TO HIDE BUT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. So NDO, WHEN are you going to address and air your fault?! Never?!!

Fast friendly service.  They will do whatever style you want, pick it off Pinterest or ask them what they suggest.  My friend was having a bad day from work so the girl doing her pedicure gave her a free massage to help her day.    They welcome their regulars and ask about their families, was nice to be in the atmosphere.  I got a mani and pedi for $35 in about 60 min. I will be back again!

My ac stopped blowing air into the house last night but I could hear the unit running on the roof.  Searched on yelp for good services, saw Clark within .6 miles from me and 5 star service.  Called him and he was at my house within 15 minutes! Very friendly and went right to work, came back down after 20 minutes or so; explained my control board is fried would be $400 repair to fix cooling/heating. I was concerned with the unexpected bill, so he said he could bypass it to allow the cooling to work but the heating won't work, so I'll need to get it fixed before winter.  He bypassed it, wrote me a receipt and gave me his business card and magnet to replace the board when I can afford it. I payed $85 to fix my ac today, a regular service check is $55 but if he does any repair that's free, and you just get charged for the repair.   I live alone and have no clue about ac units, so he answered all my questions and explained to me the problem and how a unit should work. Was very patient and understanding.  Will be using him for all my service needs from now on! Thank you!

The worst breakfast wrap I've ever eaten. The tortilla was rubbery, the eggs looked fake and the sausage was bland. I can't believe I spent $11 on that sorry excuse for breakfast. Do not order the breakfast wrap unless you want to be disappointed.
