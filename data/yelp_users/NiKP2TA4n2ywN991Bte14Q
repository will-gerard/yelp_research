Compared to my other experience with a cab company in Phoenix, the AAA Yellow Cab was like the heavens parting and saving me. (See clean air cab for the traumatic story of before).  Not wanting a repeat of our frightening first night in Phoenix we decided to go with a cab company we actually  recognized and I'm so glad we did. When they arrived they came into our hotel lobby to find us and called out my name, I'm glad they did because I was expecting a yellow cab and it was a white cab with "AAA Yellow Cab" written on the side. I didn't even know they were the same company!  The driver knew the area we were going to, asked for the address before starting the meter and plugged it into the GPS. We got there with no trouble, the cab was clean, the driver and his co-driver (who I think was in training) were polite and told us random facts about Phoenix as we were driving as soon as they found out we were from out of town.   Their credit card machine wasn't working yet but they did have a hand CC machine to take them. Although it was a little more expensive than other companies, the money was worth it for my safety and sanity!!

First things first... FREE WIRELESS?!!! I love you Sky Harbor. I don't travel very often for work but when I do I always end up having to pay $6 for 2 hours worth of wireless, and I often only get to use about 45 minutes of that before I have to board my flight. This does not make me happy.  So free wireless would get you 5 stars in my book, but add on the fact that it was the fastest check-in and security process I've ever been through (on a Friday morning no less!!), makes me love this airport. Hopefully I will get to come back to Phoenix Sky Harbor because although I'd never thought I would say it, this airport made travel a pleasant experience!  Go Phoenix!

What a cool comic book shop. The store is seriously just one big room with rows of comic books, old school style. That makes me happy on the inside! When I was in Phoenix for business I was drawn in from afar because we were waiting on a ride back to the hotel anyway.   Guy that was working there was super nice and knew a ton about comics so he was able to help a friend of mine who was not well versed buy something for her boyfriend.   I don't know what else to tell you except it's a great store!

YAY! That perfectly describes how I felt when I went to Buffalo Exchange. I'd never really shopped resale stores before and I have no idea why I picked a work trip to start but Buffalo Exchange got me addicted. I got a pair of designer shoes, got to try on some clothes (and buy them) that I normally would never have found and it was all so inexpensive!  I really liked this place, liked the staff, liked how it was all laid out (even though the racks can be difficult to sort through) and I just wish I could live near one of these so I could go back again.

Ehhhhh. When my favorite part of the meal is the salad, there's a problem with a seafood restaurant.   I got the spinach and berries salad which was actually REALLY delicious, I ate every bite of it and I'm glad that I did because the crabcakes I ordered were horrible. So bad in fact that I sent them back. The clam chowder my friend ordered was kind of watery and might have had a good flavor, but it wasn't even that hot. Blech.  Other friend got some shrimp dish and she really couldn't say much about it except "meh". I was really dissapointed that we came here instead of one of the other places in Phoenix/Tempe because I've been here for work before and had much better food. I definitely won't be back next time I'm there for work!

Holy mother of pizza. When I travelled to Phoenix on business and asked the Phoenix yelpers where to go, I was a little surprised so many people said Cibo. I was even more surprised when I saw how many reviews it had. Well, Phoenix, I understand now. I have seen the light. You have converted me to Ciboism.  It's. Phenomenal.  The location is in a neighborhood and it's obviously a converted house where the outdoor seating is actually on the front lawn with some nice lights in the trees. Very cool to sit outside on a cool night in Phoenix and enjoy great company and delicious food!  When I was looking at the menu I was so excited to see so many options for Pizza Biancha (white pizza!). I can't eat tomatoes so it was like a kid in a candy store for me. Once I saw the Di Notte I knew it had to be mine. A huge portion, wood fired pizza with fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses along with spicy salami. It was to die for. I enjoyed it at the table AND I enjoyed the leftovers. My co-workers even stole a slice each and couldn't stop ooo'ing and aah'ing over it.  One of my co-workers got a meatball sub which he swore up and down was as good as his authentic-from-Italy grandmother's. He said it might be sacriledge to say it, but it was true. My other co-worker had a half vegetarian and half ham and she said the whole thing was delicious.  For dessert, even though we were full, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the Nutella & Marscapone crepe. It was a warm crepe filled with nutella and marscapone cheese, covered in powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with a dollop of ice cream. It was sinfully delicious.  I completely agree that this might be the best pizza I've ever had!! Thank you Phoenix, and thank you Cibo!!

Okay, so when I went to Phoenix on business I asked the local yelpers what were the top places I had to go, and although I only got to go to two of the restaurants they suggested I'm so glad that FEZ made the cut.  My co-workers and I had an incredible experience with Brandon, our waiter, who was so cute and fun and answered all of our questions as we tried to choose what to have on this amazing menu. I also got to talk to Thomas (the owner) who was so funny and friendly! I love it when I get to meet the person behind the restaurant, and I can see that his positive personality comes through in the decor and the food!  We got there early (around 4:00) and started out with some happy hour drinks. They had half-off margaritas, and I can truly say that the Pomegranate Margarita has spoiled me and I have to find something similar in Dallas, it was the perfect drink, sweet but not sugary, and STRONG. My co-worker tried the Tart Apple Margarita, and it was okay, but the pomegranate was AMAZING! And for $3.50 you can bet I signed up for several of them! Haha.  Since we weren't very hungry when we first got there we started with some appetizers. We grabbed the garlic & rosemary fries and an order of the chicken phyllo packets. The fries are incredible, and there are a surprisingly large amount in the basket. When it first arrived we didn't think it would be enough for three people to share, but everytime we looked down there just seemed to be MORE fries. That = awesome. The chicken phyllo packets were pretty good, not amazing, but a good starter.  To get down to the entrees, I am so glad I tried the FEZ burger. Although many of the dishes looked good, I'm always tempted to try any dish that a restaurant is willing to put their name on. I skipped the BBQ sauce and put it on the side (I did try it with a few bites, and it was good, but it would have overpowered the burger). I had never tried a burger with pears on it, and it was SO good, it added something smooth to the burger which cut the bite of the salty feta in the right way. The lemon garlic aioli was light but added so much flavor to the burger and coupling that with the sweet crisp of the onion strings, I was SINGING the praises of this burger after dinner (and when I had my leftovers because it was a BIG burger).   I always say you know the food is good when the table is silent, and so I'll end this review by saying that for a business dinner, we didn't talk about much at all. Thank you Phoenix, and thank you FEZ!

I have no idea how these other reviewers have given this company a high rating, but I had two HORRIBLE experiences with them on my last trip to Phoenix. Read if you're curious, but the bottom line is, this is the WORST cab company I have ever used, they don't know where they are going, hire inexperienced, dangerous drivers, and waste your time!  My hotel suggested them, and I'm sure it was some kind of kick-back deal from Clean Air because they didn't live up at all. My co-workers and I wanted to go out to dinner and the restaurant was 9 miles away so we had to cab it. We called CAC and they arrive about 20 minutes later (not a bad wait). When we get in we start to explain where we're going and the cab driver just starts to drive, then turns around and asks us where it is. We inform him we're from out of town, hence the CAB, and he says "oh okay" and continues driving. About 5 minutes later this happens:  Cab: You know the address? Us: uhhh, I guess we can pull it up on our phones? Cab: Yeah, yeah, give me the address. Us: *pulls up Yelp, reads off address expecting him to put it in the GPS attached to his dash* Cab: *still driving* Okay, read it slower. *proceeds to pull out his blackberry and WHILE DRIVING enter the address, swerve around cars, and basically scare the hell out of us* Us: OMG!! Why aren't you using the GPS??? Cab: *holding the blackberry in one hand, driving with the other* This works fine, I get you there.  After following his blackberry GPS for a while he suddenly swerves across four lanes of traffic on the highway and exits, we all scream, and eventually get to the restaurant which WE have to point out to him so he slams on the breaks and let's us out in the middle of the street. Yay, we didn't die!  Going back to the hotel we decide to use CAC cause we have their card, I have no idea why. I think we were drugged from the yummy food we had. After we called the dispatcher said it would be 20 minutes, so we turned down the two Yellow Cabs who drove by offering to take us. We should have taken them, it took the guy over 40 minutes to get there and he called me TWICE asking where we were and if I could help him get there. I DON'T LIVE IN PHOENIX, THAT'S WHY I'M USING A CAB.   When we got in the driver AGAIN started the meter and started driving before asking us where we were going, or putting in the address. Not wanting a repeat performance I yelled at him to stop the car until he did and told him where we were going, he refused to use the GPS, AGAIN, and said he knew where we were going. Well, he didn't. He took us to the wrong Holiday Inn Express, TWICE. He finally said that we didn't have to pay the full fare, and we settled on a price. It took an hour and a half to get 9 miles, from start to finish.  Terrible, terrible cab company.
