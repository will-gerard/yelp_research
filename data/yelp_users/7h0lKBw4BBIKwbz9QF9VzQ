What a terrible place. My so called "trainer" could barely speak full sentences let alone english.  He kept pushing pills on me and was very distracted by all of his "gym rat friends".  He was not attentive.   As for the "membership" I could not change it to a normal one, which is not what the manage told me when I signed up with him.  I have called numerous times to speak with him and he will not get on the phone or return the messages I have left.  His receptionist staff have no clue what they are talking about and are very sketchy over the phone, it's ridiculous.  The girl could not tell me they were going to try and charge me a fee to cancel ( I have had it) because supposedly everyone's plans are different.    Do not go here. So scammy and sketchy.  Dirty equipment as well...

Food was good def different but refreshing!  They just opened last Tuesday and for that I'm impressed. They have beers on tap and a patio deal for wine/beer/apps BOGO! Great deal! I had the sausage spinach linguine, which was very good and my husband had the skewers which were cooked to perfection!!! Chicken and beef which were Sooo good and they had a smoked flavor to them. We will come back
