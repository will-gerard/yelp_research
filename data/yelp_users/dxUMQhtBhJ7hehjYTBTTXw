I keep asking myself, why do I keep shopping here? Every time I'm in here they only have 1 or 2 cashiers. It's Friday night and they have 2 cashiers. The lines are at least 7 people deep each line. The prices aren't cheaper. The service is not fast. I need to keep driving to Fry's. Every time I'm in here I'm punishing myself.

This place was absolutely delicious. We got a groupon and decided to give it a go. Why more people aren't enjoying the flavors and entertainments are beyond my comprehension. This place was sadly empty. We were the only ones at one of many teppanyaki tables. Wake up people! You get delicious dinner and a show! The chef was super friendly and cooked our seafood perfectly. I couldn't ask for more.

I was pretty apprehensive going into this store due to the bad reviews but, wow, what difference a year must make. My husband and I went in to get a free color swatch book from a coupon we got in the mail. What we thought would be a 5 min in and out turned into a 30 minute discussion on the perfect color for our preference and furniture color. Mandy, the assistant manager of the store, was extremely interactive and eager to help. I've honestly never met anyone so enthusiastic and excited about paint. And she took the time to listen to us, asked the perfect questions and was just extremely helpful. We really felt welcome in the store and like she genuinely cared about us making the right paint decision. I'm very excited to actually find a color and bring in more information so she can help us again. It seems this company listened to their customers' needs and upgraded staff. Well done. We will be returning and recommending this store and Mandy as we left with such a great impression.

I definitely disagree with the low ratings. I've been to this office several times. The staff is the happiest, friendliest bunch of people I've ever encountered at a business. I was so afraid of getting treatment because of a bad dental experience at a different dental office and they made me feel calm and comfortable about what they were doing in my mouth. They always tell me to come back if I have any pain or sensitivity and always take care of me. Dr. Dickerson was so gentle with me and I've never had a better job done of numbing my mouth. He makes it so it barely pinches. I am so grateful this office was recommended to me.

Perpetually understaffed and slow. It took 40 min of waiting in line with only 4 people ahead of me because only one person was manning the front.
