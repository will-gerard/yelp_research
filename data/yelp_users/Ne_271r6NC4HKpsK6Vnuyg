Food is never an issue but on lunch I ordered a half sandwich and soup with a bag of chips. I got my half sandwich but no soup. When I asked I was told I didn't order soup (I definitely did), and when I said OK can I add it on (still not an issue, I get mistakes happen) I was expecting to get the combo price but instead had a other almost 5 bucks tacked on for a small soup, and found out that even though chips are cheaper ($1.40 vs 4.19 for soup), I was originally charged the same price as had I gotten it with soup. Kind of disappointed in how this was dealt with, and witnessed someone else have an issue with an order while I was here...I've been spoiled by the Tempe location for years and the customer service just didn't live up at this one. My half sand/soup and chips on tip should have been in the $11 range was all of a sudden in the $15 range...for half a sandwich, a small soup and chips.

Since the change of management the food is just not nearly as good as it used to be. The Greek salad dressing is really just not good anymore. The chicken schwarma recipe has changed and does not taste like it used to. Tried it multiple times since the change and it just doesn't live up.

Dr. Ray and Julie the tech that came to our house were amazing. This was easily the hardest thing we have had to do, and they made the experience as stress free and painless as possible. They sat and talked with us until we were ready, and were fantastic at helping with our other dog, who can be a handful. They took her out with her head on a pillow, just like she would have wanted. The clay paw prints that they gave us are going to be treasured forever. Thank you to Angel Vet for being so kind and caring when we needed it most.

Good pad Thai and tempura veggies. The spicy items could be spicier but all in all good food especially for the area.

Despite the food being pretty decent, the setup and service is incredibly lackluster. If you order something that needs to be called back to the kitchen for, you risk getting completely lost in the line while you wait. Our fajita veggies were forgotten about for the nachos which caused the other food to get cold, especially because when they ran out of sour cream instead of keeping our place, they served four people ahead of us while it was retrieved from the back. No big deal except their food all ended up getting made completely before ours, leaving 3/4 of the food we ordered on the table to get cold. Foods good, process sucks.
