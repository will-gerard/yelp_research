I always love going to this bar. Been making appearances at Margarita Rocks for the past 6 years and I've seen it go through ups and downs ... the last time I stopped in a couple weeks ago on a Saturday we had a blast. There was a good crowd but it wasn't so busy that we had to wait too long for drinks. Looks like they've done some remodeling and hired some new tallent. One of the new bartenders was blowing big fire balls behind the bar and juggling bottles...it was entertaining....but there are still familiar faces on staff from years past. My friends and I have fun there, I suggest checking it out.

Zuma is a descent looking place...pattio is a little small, but it's a good looking place.  What turned me off to Zuma was the customer service. Rarely get a drink and a smile.  The staff just seems too cool for the customers.

It's just Cherry Lounge with one of the rooms painted black.  Ghetto, ghetto, and more ghetto.  I was just waiting to get stabbed...and if I'd stayed longer than 20 min I probably would have been.  To top it off the girl that served me my drinks was sort of rude and my feet stuck to the floor.  Pass.
