Friendliest staff I have yet to meet... ANYWHERE! You can tell they love their job! Great coffee. Great prices. I haven't eaten anything there so I can't comment on that. Great place to go to hang out with your friends.

I ordered a meal and asked to get a napkin to wipe soda off of the side... apparently Nallelly didn't like that. When I asked for honey and bbq. She gave me bbq and I asked again for honey. She rolled her eyes grabbed honey. Whispered to her coworker and they both laughed. She then hands me a sliced open honey.  Refused to give me her name but I read her badge.  I called manager and he blamed it on box cutting knife.  " I'll ask her about it but I'm sure she didn't do it. " I told him I saw her. He said "I'm sorry but all I can do is ask her what happened it was just the box cutting knife." No offer to call me after he  talked to her and follow through with me. Nothing. Bad service. Bad management.  NEVER AGAIN.

One complaint on behalf of my friend. The manager Chris accused my friend of not paying her tab the previous wknd in front of people. When she showed him the bank statement PROVING she had, she recieved no apology. Not classy Chris. Not classy.

I am a licensed nail tech and have a hard time finding a nail salon that does nails to my high standards. That being said, "THEY DID A GREAT JOB!" Their attention to detail is great and they are very friendly. Their salon is clean and their  prices are good. I will definitely  be a return customer.

My coworker and I both had two gift cards given to us from there and NONE of them worked. I had never been there before so they hadn't been used and the employee at Yogurtopia said flat out it had been an issue with their gift cards  before. Not very promising. Won't be back.

Never again. Showed up at 9:37 a.m. for a gel polish removal and a gel polish change. The only person there was the receptionist . She said as soon as someone  came they could start. The tech showed up. Filed my nail to break down the polish. I had one nail with NO gel on it and she tried to file my natural nail with an 80 or 100 grit file (NEVER ok on your natural nail.) I had to ask her to stop. At this time another lady came in asking if they had time for a pedi. Receptionist said yes. After she wrapped my fingers in acetone and foil she took the pedicure. I sat there for 20 minutes and ANOTHER walk in for a pedi came. Receptionist took her too. The 2nd tech came in and went to the pedi. I SAT FOR OVER AN HOUR with my fingers wrapped in acetone. (I am a nail tech, it takes 10-15 minutes for gel polish) she then without asking started filing my nails straight across with the 80-100 grit. LADIES DON'T LET YOUR TECH DO THAT TO YOUR FINGERS! I said please stop. First the shape is rounded and second please use a different grit. That file is to rough for natural nail. She tried to convince me "no it ok!" NO its not ok! She got a different file. I had no time for the polish so I left. I paid for my awful service. With gel STILL ON MY NAILS! She also let me walk out with jagged not completely filed nails AND charged me! NEVER AGAIN!
