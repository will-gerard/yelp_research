Terrible service. We came for dine in and the lady that greeted us cleared off a table and sat us before clearing off another table. Then another person came and very rudely told us "well you need to wait." We ended up leaving because of the way we were treated. We were never asked to be out on a waiting list for a table before being sat. They were sold out of everything anyway. Despite their recent so called nationwide "fame" , we will not be returning.

This place is just awesome. Come in for Louisiana beers I haven't seen anyplace else in town (namely Dixie), their combination platters never disappoint. Save room for their bread pudding!!!
