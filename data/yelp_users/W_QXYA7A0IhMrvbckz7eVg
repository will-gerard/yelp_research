This Safeway is ghetto...for Arizona.  There are always security guards hanging around and looking creepy, like maybe they stole the uniforms.  This store is always understaffed and usually only has one or two checkout lanes open when there are 20 people in line.  None of the employees are helpful nor friendly.  The products are all grossly overpriced.  I did a Fresh and Easy comparison in terms of price of a recent trip there and Safeway was a little over double the cost of F&E!  Yikes.  This is a terrible location.  All Safeways are terrible actually.  I don't like paying double and getting half the customer service I get anywhere else.  No thank you!

My husband and I booked the Mae West suite to retire to after we finished hosting our wedding festivities across the street at the Arizona Club.  We couldn't have been more happy with the place.  After a very long and full day of wedding activities, we were instantly charmed and wrapped up in the history of this gorgeous building the second we walked through the doors.  We stuffed ourselves, and my huge dress, into the very old elevator and whisked ourselves to our floor on the 4th level.  Keep in mind, this is a very old building, so the doorways are quite small.  The room inside was gorgeous and full of old school glamour.  Check out the website to see photos of the room.  We soon discovered that we both forgot to bring our toothbrushes and toothpaste and the front desk had some sent up to us right away.  If you appreciate historic buildings, old school charm, and ghost stories, you have to check this place out, it really is cool.  The value for our room was incredible too!  We only paid 99 bucks for a very large and comfortable two room suite.  A great experience.

This is the best IHOP in the valley.  It's never too crowded, it's never too loud, and the food is always good.  The service is always pleasant and attentive, but not annoying.  The best thing on the menu is obviously the Bacon Temptation Omelet.  It's stuffed with like 50 slices of bacon, covered and filled with some ooey gooey cheese sauce and it's like the size of a small cat.  It's huge and I can barely finish a third of it.  Their waffles are pretty good too, but the BTO is where it's at.  Plus, this one is conveniently located right by the light rail, so there!

We finally made it to Best of Philly since we were on winter break and could actually make it in here before they closed!  Little did we know they are actually open on Saturdays.  Oops!  We drive down Central everyday on our way home from work and we have been slowly trying all the restaurants we see.  We're almost done too!    Best of Philly is a teeny tiny little place that packs a big punch in terms of flavor.  I ordered a simple cheesesteak with nothing on it and I was very pleased.  The bread was fantastic!  It was soft and chewy with just a slight crisp on the exterior.  It definitely tasted like fresh baked bread.  The steak was thin and yummy, but I like mine a little saltier, a la Charley's.  The cheese was ooey gooey and the perfect thing to bring everything all together,  I would like to come back, maybe on a Saturday and get a cheesesteak with mushrooms.  A rogue mushroom found it's way into my cheesesteak and it was awesome!  Now I gotta see what it would be like with a whole bunch of them!

I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.  The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the "fancy" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.  Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.  This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.

There is no way I could say a single bad thing about this place.  Every time I have been here, it is the exact same thing.  The service is quick and attentive, the food is fantastic and brought out freakishly fast, and the meal is always fairly cheap.  Funny thing is, I used to be afraid of this place because of the name.  The husband always wanted to try it, but I said it sounded creepy.  As a side note, I am not a fan of spicy foods.  I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy.  So I'm a food racist.  Our first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.  Since then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!  You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns.  The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage.  They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it).  Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts.  What an amazing dish.  China Chili, I learned my lesson... Never judge a restaurant by it's name.

After stopping in here after work last week, I can now die knowing what a 15,000 dollar light fixture looks like.  It sure is pretty, but I had no idea a light could cost that much.  We've been looking for a light for our near-completed bathroom project for quite a while now.  Our taste is a little left of the middle and after leaving Modern Lighting empty handed, this was kind of our last hope.  Luckily, we found something we really liked, and amazingly enough we managed to pick the cheapest thing in there!  They have a huge assortment of chandeliers, fixtures and sconces.  The store is quite beautiful to look at and just browse.  Hinkley's is sure to please everybody's tastes and wallet sizes.

Oh my goodness!  My husband and I have driven by here many many times but never thought it was open.  Finally, at the Local First festival we were treated to samples of their oh-so-fine sausage.  You can taste the freshness in the incredible product that they put out.    We decided to finally stop by because we were making homemade pizza for our annual Christmas Eve tradition and this time, my husband and I were in charge, and we wanted to make it special.  We came in to buy Italian sausage and pepperoni, but we were hard pressed not to leave with more.  They sliced the pepperoni nice and thin exactly the way we wanted it and gave us a big giant string of weiners, which I found hysterical.  We opened the wrapped up pepperoni in the car and we had a really difficult time restraining ourselves from eating the whole thing.  Bottom line, if you want the freshest most delicious locally made sausages and other stuff like that you HAVE to go to Schreiners.

Hand's down this place is my favorite store in Phoenix.  Actually, it's my favorite store in Arizona.  I would be hard pressed to find a place cooler than this that caters so exactly to my every need and desire as a baker.  I first came here when I was searching for a place to find cupcake liners in bulk.  I had just received an order from the school I work at to do cupcakes for their homecoming.  400 of them to be exact.  Ordering liners online would prove to be too pricey as would buying out every store's stock.  Somehow, even though I have driven by many many times, I did not even know this existed.  Now I certainly do.  Inside you will find a menagerie of things to delight everyone from the amateur baker to the professional pastry chef.  You will see rows of sprinkles, hundreds of cookie cutters, a rainbow of food coloring, dozens of specialty cake pans, and cake toppers galore.  I have never gone here and walked out unsatisfied.  I always find what I need.    If I could walk around this place with a plate of bacon from Matt's, I would seriously think I had died and gone to heaven.  If you are ever in need of anything related to cakes and cake decorating, give this place a shot.  You will never consult a big box craft store for your needs ever again.

This place is awesome.  It's a tiny little hole in the wall with a waitress who has worked there forever.  The menu isn't extensive, but everything on it looks delicious.  We went here one night after work and couldn't have been happier.  I ordered gnocchi with the rosa sauce and it was incredible.  The gnocchi's were nice and small and cooked just right.  The sauce was to die for, with a hint of sweetness that made it perfect.  I don't have a whole lot to say other than that.    I definitely want to go back.  I suggest it every now and then but for some reason we haven't revisited.  That is going to have to change.

I only ever order one thing at Chili's and if I can't have it, then I am not happy.  I was in the mood for my favorite Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers so the husband and I stopped by after a little bit of b-day shopping for my mom.  This location is weird.  There were a couple weeks a couple months ago where I swear this place wasn't open.  No lights, no misters, no cars, nothing.  It was really strange.  It was definitely open this time.    We were immediately greeted by a middle aged guy, who I felt sorry for but what can you do in this economy, and were seated in the upstairs portion at a ridiculously long table/bench area with enough seating for 8.  That type of seating arrangement is really awkward when there is only two people dining.  Our waitress was good, serving us our drinks really quickly and refilling them without asking.  The food was fantastic, in terms of sauced up chicken fingers.  I love the sweet/smoky/spicy flavor of the sauce, the chicken is always juicy and the fries and corn area always tasty.  I can't really complain about anything.  I take that back, I can complain about the booth directly across from me.  There were two adults and a two year old.  The two adults were very clearly deaf.  They were using sign language and I was not so discreetly staring at them intently, fascinated by the sign language.  However, their child started screaming at the top of his lungs at one point.  I don't know how they missed the vibrations in the air right next to them, but they didn't do anything to shush him.  Oh well, I'm not at some fine-dining establishment, so I guess you have to expect it.  This is a good Chili's.

I'm not sure why but I am always hesitant to go to restaurants attached to hotels.  It could be from a bad experience in my childhood that I don't quite remember, but I think it's starting to go away.  The husband and I decided to come here because we are leaving for Washington for 6 weeks this weekend and we were on a mission to only try new places to eat our last weekend here.  We stopped by for breakfast on Saturday morning.  There were very few people in here, maybe 5 or 6 tables so we were immediately seated.  Our server was super nice in that cool-mom type of way.  She got our drinks quickly and refilled them often.  After a couple minutes perusing the menu and seeing lots of tasty things, I decided on the Rock and Roll Waffles, which is a thick waffle with bacon and eggs sitting on top of it.  Every time I order something like this, where there is supposed to be stuff on top of something else, they always serve it on the side.  Oh well.  The husband and I also decided to split a cinnamon roll as a pre-breakfast app.    The cinnamon roll was delicious.  It was sweet and gooey with just the right amount of cinnamon.  It was also one of those fabulously soft and chewy ones, not a crusty one.  It was especially delicious with a little bit of butter on it.  My waffle was also fantastic with a crispy outside and a surprisingly fluffy interior.  I didn't so much like the scrambled eggs, they were kind of flavorless, but I don't really like eggs anyway, so it doesn't matter.  The bacon was pretty good, nice and salty and a little bit thick.    I will definitely go back again in the future.  I loved the old school vibe going on with this place and I love that I get better food at a better price with better service than I would get at any Denny's or IHOP.

I like this Williams-Sonoma best.  It is always the cleanest, best stocked, and quietest location.  I think the fact that Biltmore is not as frequented as other larger malls helps.  The employees here are always friendly, and thankfully I have never found them to be pushy.  They greet me and then leave me to do my lusting... I mean shopping.  Great store if you are in the need of higher-end, fantastic quality kitchen products.

I hate all Apple Stores.  They are all the same.  Yes, I use a PC and would never use a Mac for anything, but I do love my iPod(s).  This location is pretty high up there in terms of irritability.  There's always some strange, huge cluster of people congesting the back of the store along with the prerequisite losers who come here to surf the internet.  The employees here drive me nuts.  They are either completely lazy or obnoxiously pushy with their "genius" title.  I refuse to call them that and find it embarrassing when one of these so-called "geniuses" knows less about the product than I do.  Aside from that, I also can't stand their new check-out procedure where I have to find an employee and get them to take my card and then proceed to take 10 minutes just to make the transaction.  The only Apple store I didn't try to kill anyone in has been the one at San Tan Village.  They're a little less douchey there.  Ugh!  Only go if you have to.

Well, this is probably going to be my last AZ review for a very long time.  Expect a slew of Seattle reviews instead. :o)  Taylor's Cafe was pretty awesome despite the fact that we had a little trouble finding it.  It sure is tucked away in a mass of twists and turns of pavement and stucco.  In any event, we found it and it was relatively busy.  Since there was only two of us we were seated immediately right by the door.  I kind of expected my waiter to be douchey just because of the location and the way he was "styled," but he was actually pretty awesome.  After running through the menu I kept finding omelets that were almost exactly what I wanted, save one or two ingredients.  When our waiter came back and I told him my dilemma, he told me to just make something up.  Sweet!  I ended up ordering an egg white omelet with asparagus, mushrooms, and cheese.  The food came out faster than I expected and I was certainly not going to complain about that.  Obviously my omelet was close to perfection because it was exactly what I wanted at the moment.  It was delicious and HUGE!  I couldn't even finish it!  To make a lovely breakfast experience even better, my Diet Cokes were continually topped off without me having to ask.  Now that is service.  I would totally come here again, if I still lived in AZ, but the location is kind of obnoxious and the dining area is a bit cramped.  Overall, a really great stop for breakfast.

This place really made me laugh, but mostly because of the weiner hanging from the ceiling.  He has a big happy face along with arms and legs.  How cool is that?  To say this place is bustling would be a serious understatement.  Every single time we have driven by here, there wasn't a parking spot in sight.  When we finally decided to eat here I spotted the parking paydirt right up front.    Inside is all sorts of kitschy and fun and it will suffocate you with Chicago-ness.  I love the sign that says when a Chicago team wins the world series, free sliders for everyone!  Anyway, the menu is about as simple as it gets, burgers, hot dogs, and some bigger weiners as well.  I got a cheese burger with bacon but only mayo and ketchup.  Despite all the craziness that goes on inside, they are wicked efficient in clearing the ordering line and then they pump through the orders like nobody's business.  My burger was delicious and soooooo juicy.  The cheese was all gooey and melty and the bacon was thick and crunchy.  Perfect!  To top things off, they actual put a decent amount of mayo on it instead of the usual scrape that you get most other places.  I was a happy hamburger eatin girl indeed.  If you want a good no-nonsense burger, stop by here and you won't be sorry.

This place was really entertaining for breakfast.  It's a small spot tucked in next to a few other places but it definitely stands out inside.  Once you get inside you will notice 4 things: 1- there is a giant mural of hot air balloons, 2 - there is a giant mural of nyc complete with twin towers, 3 - the awesomely bad 80's restaurant decor, and 4 - the servers look like they are fresh from Jersey Shores.  We sat down and were immediately greeted by a server who is most likely a long lost relative of Snookie, hair bump, tan and all.  She was very sweet and responsive and didn't waste anyone's time.  She was also particularly patient with the douchey dad behind us who insisted his omelet be made in the most particular fashion.  I simply ordered a waffle with bacon.  FINALLY I can order just a waffle and bacon, and not a waffle with a side of bacon.  The waffle was great, super light and very crispy.  The bacon was pretty good.  It was thick cut and salty, but a little more done than I liked.  I could have asked for it to be done a specific way, so my fault.  In any event, I would like to come back here if we're around this area and I suggest you try it sometime.

My first thoughts of this store were, "this place is weird" and, "why are there rugs for sale?"  In any event, despite the slightly messy appearance of the store, you will find a relatively comprehensive selection of home fabrics here.  Hence the name.  Imagine that!  I saw lots of fun retro patterns that sent my mind spinning in a few different directions and I saw a few, um, not so classy looking prints as well.  Their prices simply cannot be beat.  I was at a Joann shortly before my visit here and I was looking at upholstery fabric.  The fabric I was admiring was about 40 bucks a yard.  You can find a similar style here for about 10 bucks a yard.  You really can't beat the prices!  They also have a cool section in the back where you can find closeout deals on some great fabrics, some as low as 3 bucks a yard.  The main drawback to this store is their selection of regular cotton print fabrics.  It's a small, kind of unattractive selection and a bit pricey for the type.  If I decide to start any sort of home decorating project, I know exactly where I will be coming for a great deal on the fabric.

I'm not even sure where to begin.  This place is so weird!  They call themselves a saloon, and from the outside, that's exactly what it looked like.  They also have a sign out front that says no firearms allowed, but they have some weird iron sculptures of guns on the walls inside.  Strange.  Anyway, we were hungry after work, as usual, so we were looking around for something new and interesting.  After giving up on searching for something closer to our current location, we gave in and decided to give this place a shot.  After all, who can resist cheap food?  I had to stifle laughter when we walked in.  I don't know what it is, but this place gave me the giggles!  We stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before we were acknowledged and then a table was cleared for us.  Our drinks were brought out quickly and then we ordered.  Honey Mustard Chicken Wings and Fried Mushrooms for the both of us to share, and a Turkey and Bacon grilled sandwich for me.  Now, you will be sorely disappointed if you come here expecting any sort of creativity with food.  This is straight up generic as it comes food, but they at least do it right.  The chicken wings were piping hot, meaty, and had a pretty good flavor.  I'd probably order a bolder sauce next time.  The mushrooms were really strange.  They were fried, but their breading was soft, and not crispy at all.  I like the outsides to be crunchy, so they weren't my favorite, but I had plenty of ranch to dip them in and make things better.  Now, when my sandwich came out, I stared at it and was disappointed.  It just looked sad, especially with the straight from the bag wheat bread it was made with.  Let me tell ya, don't judge this book by it's cover.  My sandwich was packed with turkey and simply loaded with delightfully salty, crunchy bacon.  It was a really good sandwich, I'm just sad that I was too full to finish it!  The fries were, well, just fries.  I'll probably come back to this place sometime when we're in the area again.  The food is solid, the service is decent, and you cannot beat the prices.  I think we got a soda, 2 apps, and 2 sandwiches all for under 20 bucks.

I may not be the world's most careful person with phones, but this time, my phone breaking was NOT my fault!  Since my phone is under a year warranty (suck it iPhone!) we were told that we could take it to a Sprint Repair Center and get it replaced.  We took it to one, and the guy tried to blame the broken phone on me, when it was clearly a manufacturing defect.  He then directed us to this store and said they might be able to help us.    We came in and were immediately greeted by someone and sat down so we could get the phone issue resolved.  Pretty awesome so far.  The guy looked over the phone a bit, did some stuff in the computer and then handed me a receipt saying I could get my replacement phone in just a couple days!  He even activated my old phone so I wouldn't be communication-less.  Sweet!    I was really impressed with this Sprint store.  The employees are all very helpful, they're incredibly knowledgeable and they have a fun sense of humor.  Plus, the crazy lady next to us was entertainment.  I was very VERY happy with my experience here.

This is definitely not my favorite place for breakfast.  I hated the wicked crammed layout of this place and the decor is just confusing.  I don't get the diamond-plate on the walls and I definitely don't understand the down home country kitschy decorations up on shelves.  Whatever, it's about the food right?  I ordered a bacon and cheese omelet with hashbrowns and I was a little less than impressed.  The omelet was pretty crispy on the edges, and that is only appropriate when I order fried eggs.  The bacon was okay, but too overdone.  There wasn't enough cheese and the cheese that was there was just blah.  The hashbrowns just tasted like potatoes.  They needed a ton of salt for me to eat them.  I thought the portions, while enough for me, were a bit small for the price.  Pretty much everywhere else I can get a heaping plate of breakfast food for under 7 bucks.    I've had better.  That's really all there is.  The service was nice enough but I just don't really care for this place.  I really felt like I was eating in some po-dunk town with all the strange "characters" dining here.  At least it didn't make me sick.

You know, this may be a huge chain, but this one works like a well oiled machine on crack.  I kid you not, the husband and I were in and out of here with full bellies in a matter of 23 minutes.  This location is certainly one of the nicer looking ones and it offers some of the best people watching ever.  Almost as good as the airport!  Service here is great; fast, efficient, and no-nonsense.  The food here is good, exactly as good as you expect from the Waffle House.  Don't come here expecting anything more refined than Denny's and you will be a happy camper like me.

This was a pretty awesome place.  We were driving home along Baseline (not sure why) when the husband noticed a string of chili peppers alongside the road.  We turned around to go get some because of a special request from his mom, and proceeded to check out the rest of the store.    It was so awesome inside!  It gave me a pleasant little reminder of what the Olympia Farmer's Market was like.  There was beautiful, fragrant, fresh fruit everywhere!  There were loaves of fresh baked breads and rows of jars full of honey or yummy preserves.  It was almost an assault on my eyes with all the color flying around in here, but I loved it.  As we checked out at the counter, the girl was pretty funny, telling us that if the peppers started to fade in color we could just spray paint it, but to not eat it afterwards.  I also bought a bunch of prickly pear fruits that I plan on using in lemon bars later.  The prices in the store are pretty cheap, especially considering what I assume to be high quality  local produce.

You know, I feel kind of bad for giving this place a two star review, because I really liked our server, but as far as food goes, I can't be that generous.  They do have a great breakfast deal for super cheap, but I went the route of a half waffle with bacon, and it probably came with eggs, but I'm not so sure.  The bacon was really gross.  There's this specific type of bacon that really makes me nauseous, and Sonic has it too, but it just has a sour taste to it that makes my tummy do flip flops.  I took one bite and then left it alone after that.  The waffle looked really promising, but unfortunately it tasted like it was made from the pancake batter so it was really dense and soft, not light and crisp like Belgian Waffles should be.  What a disappointment.  I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations, but the food was just not nearly good enough.

I LOVE this place.  It's expensive, but it's soooooo worth it.  My husband took me here on our first official date.  We've since been back a few times to celebrate anniversaries and what not's.  Aside from the creepy maitre'd at this location, who later turned into a joke, this was a wonderfully romantic first date place.  I mean come on, I married the guy!  The decor in this location is simple, with an Italian flair and enough elegance to make you think you should dress up.  You don't really have to, but you wouldn't look out of place if you did.  The first time we came here, I ordered the Tortellini Panna Rosa and it was delicious.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat filling inside was super tasty.  The rosa sauce was creamy and tangy, providing the perfect complement to the pasta.  Everything was wonderful.  On our second trip back, I ordered the Chicken Fiorentina.  Wow!  It is so good.  The chicken was juicy and tender, but the sauce.  OMG the sauce is incredible.  It is called a cognac cream sauce, but they made as well call it ambrosia.  It's incredibly rich and full bodied with a thick texture that perfectly covers your chicken.  Order that if you ever go there.  The last time I remember going I wanted to get something with that delicious sauce, but I wanted to try something new.  I think I was at the Glendale location, but I can't remember.  It was a seafood pasta with the same sauce and it too was just as wonderful as everything else I have ever had here.  If you want really good Italian food and you can afford to open your wallet a little wider than the average person, go here.  If you want a romantic date, I suggest this location over the others, it's much smaller and more intimate.  A great overall experience that keeps this restaurant in my top 10.

I bought my wedding dress here and I was very impressed with pretty much everything here.  The staff was very kind and helpful and even shared in my excitement of choosing a wedding dress.  It felt like I was with friends.  The store is a decent size with a very wide variety of wedding dresses.  They have dude stuff too.  I was very impressed with the girls who helped me because I didn't have a picture of the dress I wanted with me, but they helped me narrow it down and we found "The One."  They are also very good at finding dresses that may also fit your tastes.  Overall, it was just such a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone.  Oh, they will also steam and press your dress right before the big day so it's all beautiful.

I've been here two times and both times I have been pretty pleased with what I have ordered.  They serve quality food here, have speedy services, and the prices are pretty easy on the wallet.  The Belgian Waffle Sandwich is pretty good.  I will warn you though, don't order this and expect it to be served like a sandwich.  It's more like a plate with a waffle, bacon, and eggs on the side.  Kind of weird, I just figured if I ordered a sandwich, all the good stuff would be smooshed between the waffle.  That's okay, I quickly remedied and mortified the old people sitting nearby as they watched in horror as I clutched my waffle sandwich like a cavegirl and tore in.  Haha, I love freaking old people out.  I have also had the Three Musketeers Omelet, and this guy is a beast of an egg creation.  It is completely packed with all the good stuff (bacon, sausage, and cheddar) and then it is topped with an overly indulgent, rich hollandaise sauce.  There was no way I was going to finish it, but it was very tasty.  Another good thing about this place is that they have speedy and efficient service here.  They get you your drinks quickly and take your order as soon as you set your menu down.  Then your food will come out so quickly that you will swear the cooks have telepathy.  Definitely a good place to go for breakfast.

I was really impressed with his Ultimate Electronics.  We were in the mood to shop for a new TV and we decided to see what UE has to offer.  We walked in and were greeted by at least 3 employees.  That's always nice to be acknowledged.  We wandered over to the TV's and it was a couple minutes before anyone came over.  I don't know if that was on purpose, but I do appreciate having some time to myself before I get hounded by a salesman.  The guy that came over, I want to say his name is Phil, was really great.  He was very knowledgeable about all their products and was kind of funny in a sarcastic type of way.  He showed us what they have to offer that fit our criteria and then he left and let us deliberate and what not.  I really appreciated his knowledgeable but not forcible approach.  While we didn't buy a TV that day, I feel like when we do, if we end up choosing a product that this store carries, I would be happy coming back here to make my purchase.

I cannot believe I had forgotten to review this place.  My husband and I made our first stop of wedding florist hunting here.  As we were driving up, I had very low expectations as it is in a fairly ghetto area of Gilbert and the small area it was located in was not looking promising with all the paint decorated windows.  Inside the store, it is fairly tacky, but that is to be expected with all the silly gifts and balloons and what nots.  The true beauty of this place is definitely among the flowers.  All of their florals are extremely fresh and beautiful with bold vibrant colors everywhere.  I even caught a glimpse of my favorite flower (bird of paradise) inside their large refrigerated glass display case in the center.  Things were looking promising.  Our appointment was with Elizabeth, a very friendly and attentive woman.  She brought out a few wedding books for us to flip through as we (me) described what the flowers should look like.  I wasn't finding anything I liked in the books, but I was able to piece a few pictures together to explain what I wanted.  I wanted a tropical arrangement in the middle of summer with birds of paradise as the focal points.  Elizabeth told me that what I wanted was pretty uncommon in terms of weddings and really difficult to do.  However, she said she couldn't be more excited to do my flowers.  She loves to do tropicals and she loves a challenge.  This was definitely the woman for the job.  My mom picked up the flowers the day of the wedding and brought them home just as I was finishing getting ready.  When I saw them (beware this is corny) I nearly cried because they were so beautiful and they were even better than I could have dreamed.  For about 500 dollars we got an incredibly large bouquet for me, a small bouquet for my maid of honor, a small bouquet to toss, a corsage for my gma, 4 boutonnieres for the men, and 10 beautiful centerpieces for the table.  I found that to be an unbeatable deal considering I picked one of the more expensive flowers, the difficulty in the arrangements, and the quality of service.  I cannot express how happy I was to have Elizabeth do my flowers.  I recommend her to anyone and everyone that needs flowers for any occasion.

I'm such a huge fan of food customization and this place is right up my alley.  No one is going to put gross things on my plate if I don't want them and I don't have to ask for any sort of special order.  I can load up on the broccoli and carrots and don't get charged extra.  When we came in there was a very friendly and helpful girl at the register who was happy to explain the process to us, at which point the husband looked overwhelmed and disgusted.  In any event, I had lots of fun making my own special dish and creating a magical sauce that tantalized my tastebuds.  I will definitely come back, it's just a matter of getting a certain someone to agree.

The husband and I have recently gotten more into board gaming so we were looking to expand our collection of 2 player games.  We weren't really sure where to start but we knew we wanted to stay away from the typical mall game stores that have become overrun with calendars.  The husband pulled up a great list online and this was our first stop.  The store is surprisingly large with games on one side and the game room on the other.  It's nice to not feel like you are interrupting a game when you walk in.  The game side is pretty varied, but it felt a little cluttered and unorganized.  Aside from that, they have a pretty impressive collection of games, including a few that have experienced a pretty limited release here in the states.  Overall, a great game place with friendly staff and a wide selection.

After yet another visit to Game Depot, I decided they were certainly worthy of the 5th star.  Not only to they carry an impressive array of games to appease all types of gamers, but they have a pretty awesome discount table as well.  Don't be surprised if you find that game you've been wanting for 40% off!  We've tried a couple new games that way and have always come away happy.  I really like this store.  The owner is super helpful and knowledgeable and the games are organized in a logical manner.  Want to try a new game?  Give Game Depot a shot!

I think that this is one of the better malls in the valley.  I find the store selection to be above average, and unlike many other malls it has tenants in pretty much every space.  Lots of other malls around the valley are starting to look like retail graveyards.  The food court is very large with a decent selection of food.  I probably like this mall more than others because the interior is nice and clean and doesn't try really hard to look good.  There really isn't much to say, other than it can get REALLY crowded on the weekends.

It's nice to see an Italian place actually being run by an Italian.  We came here with a group of 14 for a birthday and they had everything ready for us when we got there.  The owner/namesake introduced herself to us and she was sweet as can be and really seemed to love what she was doing.  As far as the food goes, this is what we ordered: Calamari and Stuffed Mushrooms as apps, and I got the special Filet Mignon Red Wine Risotto.  The free bread that sits on the table is deliciously buttery, crusty, and garlicky.  I enjoyed a few too many.  The calamari was good, and I especially liked that they were only rings and none of those nasty baby shaped ones.  The stuffed mushrooms looked less appetizing than they tasted and earned the name monkey brains from a few of our diners.  My risotto was not a very attractive dish.  The plate was piled high with a strange purple colored mass of rice.  Luckily I don't care too much about appearance because I gave it a shot and enjoyed it.  The steak could have been cooked less though.  I also tried the husbands eggplant parmigiana and it was really tasty.    Service was lackluster and from what I hear from those who are regular guests, the younger gal who works there is much much better.  My main irritation was the fact that the birthday boy was served last, and to make things worse, about 5 minutes after the last person was served.  All in all though, I had a good time, I enjoyed good food, and there was a ton of stuff on the menu that would bring me back.

I am a huge animal lover and a big time fish enthusiast.  I make it a point to visit any and every aquarium I can find in my travels.  It's been disappointing to live in AZ and not have an aquarium, until now.    The aquarium portion of this place is still a work in progress.  I kind of felt like I was intruding on a prohibited construction site when I was here because there was still a lot being worked on.  Unfortunately, only about 1/2 of the fish exhibits were operating, but they were pretty cool.  I love touch tanks and they have a well stocked ray tank to get your arms wet.  There was even a hawk in one of the rooms.  The hawk keeper politely informed us that we may want to look away as he was going to be feeding the hawk.  YEAH RIGHT!  I stared at that thing as it literally shredded the already dead mouse.  It was so nasty, but I couldn't stop watching!  The zoo part of this place is quite nice.  Much better than the Phoenix Zoo.  The animals seem to be quite happy in their lush surroundings.  Something that is really cool though, is they feed the animals up in the front of their confinements.  That way you get to see the animals up close and personal.    Overall, a really cool place to visit.  If you don't live out in the area, it's quite a drive, but definitely worth a visit at least once.  I found it to be a bit pricey at 26 dollars a person for both aquarium and zoo, but I still paid it and I still enjoyed it.  Just go.

I really only should give this place 1 star, but for the entertainment value, I will be nice and bump it up one more.  Our friend called and asked us if we wanted to go to here where he was planning on buying stuff for his new house.  He's full blown Italian so we figured he was just going for the traditional gaudy stuff that he has grown up with.  I was disappointed that I had to give them a dollar for "admission" and I'm not really sure why.  I also don't remember it being so ghetto, but the last time I was here was like 15 years ago.  We found our friend in the ridiculous statue shop in the corner and began to peruse our gaudy surroundings.  We got bored really quickly and just wandered around.  The best place here was the little kitchen gadget place.  Other than that, it was aisle after aisle of bedazzled obama shirts, scented oil crap, and weird used looking drug store findings.  I did find one gem though.  You can buy a mounted T-Rex bust at one of the shops.  You don't really get better than that.  I will probably never go here again.  We are poor, but I would never waste my money here.

This is one of the more eclectic antique stores.  For one thing, it's huge, and they have a TON of booths to look at.  I always find the most hilarious stuff in here.  They prices are usually pretty average in terms of antique shopping, although my husband bought From Justin to Kelly for 5 bucks here once.  Yes, that is embarrassing, but my 5 dollar movie purchase wasn't much better, The Recruit.  This is a fantastic place to check out if you aren't quite sure what you are looking for.  You can usually find some Native American stuff, African looking stuff, Southwestern stuff, and of course the old grandma type stuff that we now call antiques.  Definitely a fun store.  If you find yourself at My Florist and need to go somewhere to alleviate the stress that your dining experience just caused, I suggest you walk across the street and kill some time in the antique mall.

Ugh... this place is pretentious, it's not even funny.  I used to think sandwiches at Paradise Bakery were kinda pricey.  That was before I came to My Florist.  I  have only ever ordered the chicken salad sandwich the couple times I've been here because I am picky.  I could probably go for the PB & J, but I would have to be out of my mind to pay the price they are asking.  The chicken salad is decent, but I have had so much better.  The bread they use is artisan style bread, so of course that means ridiculously chewy crust.  This isn't a bad thing when you eat the bread by itself, but when you are trying to bite off a piece of your sandwich and the crust refuses to give, even a little bit, then you will be flinging chicken salad all over the place.  Not a good thing.  The service here is downright terrible.  I've never seen servers so smug in my life.  Sometimes I wonder if it is a joke that I'm not in on, and the other times I just wonder if they really do feel so superior as they are serving me my food.  Whatever, I don't really care.  Everything here is super slow.  My soda takes forever to come out because the bartender always thinks that his social life is more important than my soda at the time.    In any event, I avoid this place.  The crowd is always too uppity for my taste and they are mostly old.  You should have seen the look of some of the people in there when I went in wearing pajama pants one night (I was ready for bed when the husband and his friend wanted to go out to eat.)  Hilarious.  On the positive side, the pianist here is fantastic.

I'm really lucky to live where I live.  I have a good number of places to eat that are all within walking distance or along the lightrail.  This little gem of a place on Roosevelt has been a favorite of mine and the husband's.  It's a tiny little place with minimal parking in the back, but it packs a punch for it's size.  Inside you will find a small but comprehensive selection of some Italian staples that may be more difficult to find in other areas.  They have pizzelle, anise, spices, and even some specialty imported tomato sauces.  Their meat and cheese selection is also small but comprehensive. Everything always looks fresh and tasty.  They keep everything in smaller quantities so I take comfort in the fact that they aren't selling me old crappy food.    When we eat here, I typically get the gnocchi.  Now, it certainly isn't the best.  I'm pretty sure it has been previously frozen, or maybe the same stuff that they stock on their shelves.  However, it's still a tasty gnocchi.  Tender potato dumplings sit in a pool of yummy marinara sauce.  I'm not typically a fan of marinara sauce, but in this case, I love it.  It's a really simple sauce with just the right amount of basil and oregano to remind me of what Italian food should taste like.  I once got the chicken salad sandwich here.  I love chicken salad and will usually try it when presented with the opportunity.  Unfortunately, I really did not like this kind.  It was a little on the dry side for my taste, but man was this SPICY!  It was overwhelming to me, maybe in part to the fact that I was not expecting it.  However, the husband finished it off and really really enjoyed it.  Finally, anything with meatballs on it from here is a solid choice.  They are big and flavorful with a delicate blend of spices mixed in.  I'm not sure if they use meat other than beef in there, but I have a feeling they might use lamb.  Yum.  Overall, a good bet if you are downtown and want a good Italian Sub.

Being a white girl from Gilbert I never thought I would eat at a place that combines fried chicken with waffles.  The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.  Sometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.  When the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of "mush" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.  There is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.  Lo-Lo's, I will love you forever, my body be damned.

I really enjoyed this place, but I have only been here twice.  Both times I got the same thing and experienced pretty much the same in terms of atmosphere and service.  The service is so-so, which is a little disappointing considering the price of the food, but I can't recall either time being awful, just not personable is all.  I have had the Cowboy Chop there and it is pretty close to mind-blowingly good.  The meat is so tender and juicy that you can almost use a fork to cut it.  It's also incredibly flavorful and pairs wickedly well with the bourbon apple relish.  Apples and pork together is always a winning combo.  This is definitely a delicious restaurant and I really appreciate their consideration for local and sustainable food products, but it is a bit out of my price range.  Thankfully both times I've been, I didn't pay.  If you are looking for a nicer dinner option downtown and have a hole burning in your pocket, give Portland's a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, it's right off a lightrail stop.  Woohoo!

After having fully recovered from my nightmarish Burger Studio experience, the Husband and I decided to try another restaurant that specializes in burgers.  This time, however, was a completely different experience.  The menu has an offering of burgers, chicken, and fish and chips.  There are onion rings, fried mushrooms, and fries for sides.  A few other items round out the simple item and everything is very reasonably priced, most being under 6 dollars.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger with American cheese and a wheat bun.  A pleasant surprise is the fact that you can choose between white, wheat, and onion buns.  Yay!  We also got a side of fries to share.  The total for 2 Works burgers, a side of fries, and 2 sodas was about 16 bucks.  Not bad at all.  I could immediately see that I was getting a good burger when I took off the top bun and visited the condiment bar.  The burger patty itself was large and slightly misshapen, definitely a hand formed patty.  The condiment bar has pretty much all the typical fixings that you would expect.  This was a good burger.  It was well seasoned, nicely cooked, and had a great charred taste.  The bun was fresh tasting and a nice change from the typical sesame seed burger bun.  The fries were portioned for one person, but they were substantial and tasty.  I really enjoyed this place from the cheap prices to the awesome vintage decor.  The tables were brushed copper and very cool looking.  The entire restaurant is actually larger than it looks from the outside and even has a bit of outdoor seating.  There is a decent sized bar on the side of the restaurant that everyone seemed to be having a great time at.  If I am in the mood for a no-nonsense good quality burger, I will definitely come here.

I got my super cute pink cruiser from some little Asian guy's storage rental in California a couple years ago.  It's a cheap but great bike.  After realizing how convenient it is, my husband wanted a bike too.  He wanted a similar style to mine, but obviously a men's version.  We set out to look for one and the first place we stopped was Landis.  We certainly didn't buy a bike from here considering the crazy prices that you can charge for cruiser bikes these days, but we did enjoy browsing here.  They have a huge selection of all kinds of bikes.  The price range starts a bit higher than say, Target's bikes, but I'm sure the quality is amped up here.  The staff all seemed very friendly and helpful here, but I don't have a lot of experience.  This definitely seems like a great place for bike enthusiasts to go and talk to people who actually know their stuff.

I am typically a Fili B's girl as opposed to the generic ***berto's fan, but I can compromise since Fili B's are harder to find when you aren't in the EV.  I was really really craving a big ol' steak and egg burrito, and I knew the only way to satisfy that craving would be from one of these places.  We were on our way uptown and we ALWAYS see cars in the Eriberto's drive thru on our way to work, so I figured it had to be one of the better ones.  Oh man it is!  My burrito was more like a steak with egg burrito.  It probably weighed three pounds!  It was absolutely delicious, flavorful, and surprisingly not greasy!  I devoured a whopping half of it before I tapped out and then I ate the rest for breakfast the next morning, and yeah, it actually tastes just as good.  I can't really attest to the quality of the other menu items, but if they are even half as good as my burrito was, then you're in good hands.

We were hungry and not willing to wait to cook or for restaurant service so we decided to grab some Subway on our way home.  At the last minute we changed our minds and got Kyoto Bowl instead.  The husband was a little over-enthusiastic to try it and I warned him to keep his expectations low, but not as low as Yoshinoya Beef Bowl low, ugh.  Anyway, we walk in, and as expected the place is decorated like every other Kyoto Bowl with ugly white tiles and ugly white benches.  There is too much white, and considering the location, it was more like grey.  They also had two fish tanks for me to stare at while waiting for our order.  One of them was half drained and the other had half a dozen tetras swimming around.  Real fancy.  Anyway, I got the Teriyaki Chicken and an egg roll because nothing else really sounded good.  There isn't a lot to choose from anyway.  The husband got the Orange Chicken.  My Teriyaki chicken was just meh.  The chicken was a little overcooked and the sauce was so bland.  I figured for sure I would get a tasty, over-garlicky sauce here, but no.  The egg roll was okay, a little soggy though.  I also found it a bit odd that the meat inside the egg roll was beef.  I thought pork was the norm.  Anyway, this place is definitely not worth going out of your way for.

It's very hard to choose a vet for your four legged friend that is practically your child.  After doing a lot of searching, I decided on Alta Vista for a lot of reasons.  The staff was very friendly to me on the phone with all my annoying questions, the location was close to my home, the hours are unbeatable, and they were able to get me an appointment immediately.  My dog Rally only needed a Rabies shot, but it was still a big deal to me.  When we came in for his appointment, I was pleased to see a very large waiting area that was very clean.  Small lobbies are terrible for veterinary practices because the animals get way too anxious in those small places.  The staff was also very friendly at the front desk.  We waited about 15 minutes past our scheduled appointment, but I guess that's what all doctors do.  Rally's vet, who we did not choose, was Dr. Todd Carter.  Unfortunately, Rally did not take too kindly to him and was very scared.  While I'm sure Dr. Carter is a great vet, I will probably select a female the next time around, as Rally feels more comfortable around women.  Overall, a nice experience here.

I really hated this place.  Granted, I am not a fan of Mexican food, but I know good Mexican food when I taste it, and I know bad Mexican food when I taste it.  I will tell you that this place is getting one star solely on the absolutely terrible food I had and the awful service.  First of all, our server was hardly ever present.  I found this strange considering our group of 4 was only 1 of 3 or 4 tables in the whole place.  We ordered an appetizer along with our drinks, specifically requesting for the app to come out before the entrees.  This didn't happen.  In fact, our entrees were served and we never received our app.  After we pointed that out to our waiter who decided to stop by after we were about 3/4 done with our food, the waiter asked if we would like for him to get it now.  Um, no.  We're done now.  Ugh  As for the food, it was far below mediocre.  I got the beef flautas and they were awful.  The meat was as dry as can be and had absolutely no seasoning.  NONE!  The shells were somehow soggy and flavorless.  Boo.  I order one of the easiest things to make on the menu, besides a quesadilla, and I get the worst possible experience.  What a shame.  Everyone else didn't seem too thrilled about their food either.    I hate this place.  I will never be back.  It's hard to get people to come back when the whole restaurant smells like a port-a-potty.  I can excuse the filth, because honestly, doesn't good Mexican food come from a dirty kitchen?  See ya Mi Patio, I'm heading over to Filli B's.

What do you know, I went back!  The owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was I was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  This time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, I find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  I will clarify that I would like to give this place 3.5 but I am rounding up because I have never had chicken as juicy as I did the other night in my entire life.  The husband and I stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  As the time progressed, it became much busier.  I would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell I picked up on last time is no longer there.  All I smelled was the food.  We seated ourselves, I glanced over the menu, and I knew what I was going to order.  Thanks to reviews from nathan and Amber, I ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, I went with the Baja Chicken Burro per the owner's suggestion.  The Quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  I cut it open to share and I couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  It was like porn to me.  I have an addiction to food porn.  The taste of it was fantastic.  The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  The Baja Chicken Burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  The outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  I was nervous about the sauce because I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  It was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  The chicken was incredible.  It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm.  I can't believe I am saying that about Mexican food, but it's true.  They know their chicken.  Overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  It started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  I also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  The owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  It was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  I take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around.  Next time I have a taste for Mexican food (probably next cinco de mayo week) I will think about stopping by again.

I have such a soft spot for Chinese Buffets.  I love that I can get lots of weird little things for one small price.  Really though, if I am being perfectly honest, I'm just going to gorge myself on Chinese Donuts (fried pieces of dough rolled in sugar).  This place is not the cleanest of establishments, and it has a really weird open feeling going on.  It really needs a little love.  Strip off the peeling wallpaper and put up a couple coats of fresh paint and no one will know the difference!  At least I wasn't afraid to eat here.  The food was not bad, but it just wasn't interesting.  A lot of the chicken dishes were overcooked and some of the stuff was so heavily battered that not all of it got cooked through so you had a bit of a mushy mess.  The standout was definitely the fried rice.  It was really really good fried rice.  I also liked the beef and broccoli, but that's about it.  There's not really much else to say, but for about 6 bucks, I'm not really going to complain.

The more I think about it, the more I realize how lucky we are in Phoenix to have so many cool vintage-y type stores around, especially in the Melrose District.  This was just another stop on our vintage shopping spree whilst looking for a vintage looking ornate iron mirror.  No such luck on that.  I can't complain too much though, because I was introduced to this wonderful store.  Walking in is kind of like an assault of femininity.  There are fluffy things everywhere, sparkle covered candles, and the colors pink, green, and white abound.  I also can't forget the massive amounts of shabby chic stuff in here, but that is pretty obvious just by looking at the outside of the store.  After perusing the store for a bit, and finding lots of cool stuff that we couldn't necessarily afford and didn't necessarily need, we happened upon a ceramic bowl filled with vintage doorknobs and keyholes.  We were instantly inspired by this.  We found an amazing doorknob set from the New Orleans Public School.  Buying that and a matching set of keyholes set us back about 32 bucks.  Not too bad.  I also discovered this place has scrapbook stuff.  I used to be an avid scrapbooker, but not so much anymore.  I could get into serious trouble at this place.  They have so much beautiful paper and so many pretty odds and ends.  This is really an awesome place, especially if you are into that whole shabby chic style.

I liked this place because of its simplicity and of course because the food was pretty good.  It was a seat yourself kind of deal and we found ourselves an empty booth and only waited a couple minutes before the lone waitress came over and handed us menus and took our drink order.  After some deliberating I went with the Original Wineburger with American Cheese and Bacon.  We also ordered the "Pounder of Fries".  It took a little longer than I thought it should have for just burgers and fries, but I was in a good mood so I didn't let it bother me.  Our fries came out in a huge mound in a basket and they were soooooo good!  They were incredibly crispy on the outside but nice and soft and fluffy on the inside.  They were really good.  The burgers came out on really small plates which I found humorous but I expected it after reading the other reviews.  My burger was perfectly cooked and the bacon was thick and delicious.  None of this was greasy.  I really liked this place and I love that it cost under 20 bucks for our meal.  Great place that feels comfortable to eat in.  I do have to mention though, if you have seen "True Blood" this place will totally remind you of Merlotte's.

I'm a shameless carnivore.  I like it even better when my meat filled sandwich is dripping with melty, gooey cheese.  A little explicit, yeah, but it's the truth.  I've never been to a Charley's other than the one in Christown/Spectrum (call it what you want) but it is so much fun eating my yummy food and watching all the ghetto people and their spawn mill in and out of the sad mall.  The food here is great.  I always get the Bacon 3Cheesesteak, and it is the best.  You can't ask for more salty goodness than this.  The steak stuff is always thin and juicy with plenty of salt.  The bread this stuff comes on is kind of weird and crusty, but the insides make it worth it.  Do yourself a favor and make it a combo so you can get a drink and a big cup full of fresh and hot fries.  I know there quite a few of these around the valley, so if Spectrum scares you, check out one of the other places and get what I order.  Good stuff.

I'm not really sure why this place has such a good rating, and I'm especially clueless as to how it has 2 ROTD out of only 10 (now 11) reviews!  I'm not really sure how to describe the interior of the place, but I totally agree with Iain, that this looks like some weird diner we would probably stop at while traveling.  The service was okay, and the owner is clearly enthusiastic and cares about his customers, but the food is not so good.  I ordered a bacon and cheddar omelet.  It comes with a side of hashbrowns and bread (I got biscuits.)  The omelet is seriously fluffy, and quite large.  My first bite was not a pleasant one.  It tasted like someone spilled some sort of fruit juice all over the griddle while they were cooking it.  I wasn't real thrilled with that and only ate about a third of it before I couldn't stomach it anymore.  The hashbrowns were bland, but were saved with a good dose of salt and pepper.  The biscuits were decent and at least cleared my palate of the fruity omelet.  Really, this is just meh to me.

Meh is the perfect word for this place.  I love Chinese food, so I figured there couldn't be anything wrong with this restaurant as our choice for lunch.  The seemingly only worker here was the hostess, server, and busser all rolled in to one.  Thankfully she wasn't the cook too.  The interior of this restaurant is just a huge mess.  There is one bench seat that is sitting on milk crates and there are some random padded panels hanging on the wall or sitting on the floor.  Nothing really makes sense in here.  The menu is gigantic, both in physical size and variety of food.  I decided to go with something I have had great luck with at other restaurants, the Walnut Shrimp.  They went overboard with the sauce here, there was just so much of it!  If you aren't familiar, it's a very heavy mayo based sauce, so just imagine what too much of it looks like.  The shrimp were fine and the candied walnuts were delicious, but there was something seriously wrong with the batter around the shrimp.  It was very eggy, slimy, stringy and thick.  It was really gross and reminded me of chewing on fat.  I had to pull as much of it off of the shrimp as I possibly could so I could eat the edible part.  I definitely won't go back here, and thankfully I'm not at Deer Valley enough to make this a problem.

Eek!  Says it perfectly.  Maybe it's because I am a white girl with blonde hair, blue eyes, and was raised in the suburbs, but this mall terrifies me.  The husband got a baseball hat for Christmas and we had to return it here of all places.  As soon as we walked in, I instinctively clutched all of my valuables to my chest and grabbed the husband's hand.  I didn't release that position until we were safely back on the road.  I know this mall is ghetto because it is in the ghetto.  That makes sense.  You cater to your audience, not to people who live miles and miles away.  Needless to say, I don't belong here and they don't have anything to offer here that would make me think otherwise.  I won't be back unless I am forcibly dragged.

The Mesa Arts Center is certainly an impressive modern sight in the old fashioned Downtown Mesa area.  My wonderful husband surprised me this past weekend to tickets to my favorite show, Tap Dogs, and it happened to be at this theatre.  As we walked around the grounds, I couldn't help but be impressed with the interesting architecture and all the work that went into keeping the grounds beautiful and fun to look at as well.  There are so many things/areas to look at outside, there's no way you would get bored while waiting for a show.  Once inside the Ikeda Theatre, we were greeted by very friendly ushers who happily showed us to our seats as well as made a few jokes along the way.  The interior of the theatre is quite impressive, something that I think will certainly stand the test of time and ultimately become quite the destination for performers.  The seats were comfortable, the acoustics were wonderful and the layout tried to make every seat as good a seat as possible.  I really enjoyed this theatre and I would love to see another show here.

In terms of food, I would really only give this place a 3 star rating because I didn't find it to be particularly wonderful.  However, I loved the setup of the menu that let you order as little or as much as you like without having to break the bank by ordering everything a la carte.  The place is fairly small and tucked away in a place you might miss if you were driving by, but they have a pretty big sign out front.  It was a seat yourself kind of deal and the server came by pretty quickly to take our drink order.   While waiting for drinks I was able to observe the eclectic and not entirely cohesive crap all over the walls and on the shelves.  I didn't quite understand why some stuff was on the walls, but to each his own.  The restaurant seemed a wee bit dirty but it didnt really bother me one bit.  For breakfast I ordered 2 buckwheat pancakes, an egg, and some bacon.  The egg was cooked just the way I like it, with the edges of the white nice and crispy.  The bacon was fine, but nothing special.  The pancakes were enormous and entirely too much food for me.  They were pretty tasty, but a little on the dry side for my taste.  The East Valley is lucky to have such a nice alternative to the usual suspects for breakfast.

This place really isn't that wonderful or amazing, it's really just your typical breakfast joint with a little bit of flavor sprinkled in.  The flavor comes in the form of Mexican styled breakfasts.  Now, I really don't care much for Mexican food but they keep it pretty tame here.  I figured since it was offered, and it seemed unique, I would pick one of the Mexican breakfasts and I went with the Bacon Breakfast Quesadilla.  WOW!  It was really really good!  You get a really big tortilla that's totally stuffed with lots of eggs, tons of ooey gooey cheese, and more bacon than you can hope for.  The tortilla was perfectly crisp and surprisingly strong enough to hold up all the goodness inside.  It also came with beans that weren't very good, but beans are beans.  I really loved my breakfast here and i wish I could get something like that closer to home instead of all the way down in Chandler.  Service was fine, nothing remarkable about it.  That's the way I like it at breakfast time.  Strange little place that lacks in charm, but it definitely packs a mean breakfast quesadilla.

I guess I am kind of partial to GolfLand.  They really aren't worth the four stars I am giving them, but I grew up with this place.  I've had many family outings, dates, and nights out with friends here.  It's fairly ghetto and marginally trashy, but I still love it.  I enjoy the courses they offer, and some of them are really creative, but others can get a bit tedious...BOO ANTHILLS!  The main problem here is that they can get really really crowded, especially if they have one of the courses closed, like they did the last time we went.  However, since I am reviewing this as a cumulative experience, I am still giving them the 4 stars, even if a lot of it is based off of fond memories.

This is the kind of place that could turn a carnivore into a vegetarian.  I have always been very resistant to soy products and any form of faux meat.  It just always seemed so gross to me.  Due to a recent change in my lifestyle to be healthier, I have looked into healthier alternatives including what I used to turn my nose up at.  We saw a demonstration at Devoured by Chef Damon where he turned some of the weirdest ingredients (to me) into a beautiful yummy dish.  I had to see what else he had to offer.  First of all, the place is nothing like I expected.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something along the lines of True Food Kitchen.  Instead, it felt like a mess hall at some weird Liberal Arts school, and I say all that in a good way.  It's an order and pay at the counter then wait for your food at a table ordeal, which normally is fine by me.  Unfortunately the girl who had our food never bothered to call out the name we gave and instead walked around casually asking people who she thought might have ordered our dishes if it was theirs.  Finally she made her way to us after about five minutes.  That was annoying.  Forget about that though, because the food is good enough to make up for that little mishap.  (Other staff members seemed to call out names perfectly fine, just not that one.)  I ordered the Drunken Mushroom Chicken and grabbed an Oogave soda out of the cooler for my dinner.  The soda was great, and you can buy them at Sprouts, awesome.  The "Chicken" was expertly crafted with a texture almost identical to chicken and a taste just as close.  The breading around it was yummy, slightly crunchy, and a tiny bit sweet.  My bowl was packed full of delicious fresh veggies and loads of mushrooms.  There was also a generous helping of rice noodles buried in there too.  It was all fantastic, and I would eat it every night if I could.  i will most certainly be back to Green to try everything else on their menu.  Everything looks so good!  When it's actually good for you too, you just can't resist!

I'm not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go-Kat-Go, but I finally did and loved it!  This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.  We've got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.  I will definitely be back, especially since my other mom's b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff.

We weren't in the mood to go to some boring chain and we weren't having a whole lot of luck searching for breakfast places because we had already been to most of them.  After getting a little deeper in the search, the husband suggested this place.    I was immediately surprised when we walked in by the sheer amount of tables and chairs they managed to pack into this tiny little restaurant.  This is definitely not a place to come and eat if you have personal space issues.  While it was extremely busy inside we were immediately seated at a tiny table for two and greeted by a sweet lady named Sue.  I ordered the Country Breakfast with Bacon so I could try a little of everything that this place had to offer.  My meal came with 2 eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, fried potatoes, and the awesome little muffin basket everyone has talked about.  The little muffin basket served pre-meal like bread at an Italian restaurant is why I give this place 4 stars instead of just 3.  Everything else was average but good.  The prices were fair, the amount of food was plentiful, and the service was quick and friendly.  I could definitely see myself coming back here if I am in this part of town.

It really pains me to give this stadium 2 stars.  A place that once welcomed me with open arms as an 11 year old girl 11 years ago has painfully tossed me aside in favor of pandering to the new 11 year olds.  I used to be valued and loved here.  I was given gifts and great deals at the concessions.  Funny thing is, I never paid for my ticket back then.  Things have changed.  Unfortunately, they have changed for the worse.    My husband and I actually got engaged here, that's how much I used to love it here.  No, it wasn't on the Jumbotron, my now husband was lied to.  He was told that he would get his proposal to me on the big screen and even a special video to document.  Shortly before then, they canceled on him, crushing his dream of making my dream come true.  Instead, I was treated to a much more intimate, beautiful and heartfelt proposal.  It still happened at Chase Field, but no thanks to the organization.  This is just one of many letdowns from this place.  After we were married, we attended the games as proud season ticket holders.  It was exciting to watch this young team climb up the playoff ladder and make a good run for the series.  Unfortunately it was quite painful along the way.  We were introduced to the idiots known as Mike and Vanessa.  They add nothing more to the game other than making it an embarrassing spectacle in the world of baseball.  Then we met the Rallybacks, nothing more than glorified Hooter's girls wearing baseball apparel.  They couldn't name you one player on the team.  Sad.  One day they gave away margarita glasses to the adult crowd.  Not wanting to ignore the children who get special kid's only giveaways at every game, they made them special kids tumblers glasses.  They were way cooler and I asked to exchange my adult glass for the kids glass.  I was very rudely declined by the power hungry ticket taker.  I always felt that as a season ticket holder, I should be entitled to ALL of the giveaways, after all, I was giving a ton of money to this team.  That was out of the question.  Finally, we discontinued our season tickets.  We did this out of disgust at the way we were treated by this organization.  Our baseball buddy had injured her leg quite badly during the season and suffered a good amount every time she walked the stairs down to our seats.  We sat her on the end so she wouldn't have to be cramped or get up (we were in a very short row of 7 seats and we took up 3).  Unfortunately the other people in our row did not share the same concern for her and constantly shoved past her when they could have disturbed their own party instead.  This caused a great deal of verbal assaults on us, one even resulting in a threat of violence.  We reported this to the security and were completely ignored.  The best the team could do was move us to the opposite side of the stadium and put us in worse seats.  There are  few good things about this place.  Derrick Hall is one of them.  He immediately responded to every one of my emails, even the one where I asked if I could have the old Jeff Salazar posters since he was no longer part of the team.  I never did get those.  I appreciated his apology when I told him about the whole "seat debacle" but he couldn't offer me what I felt I deserved.  That's okay, because he has a whole stadium to worry about.  I still think that he is a good and decent guy with a great love for baseball.  I think he will do great with this team.  Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends.  I'm sorry, but I may not be back here.  It's like a bad breakup for me because I had such a long, loving relationship with this place despite all the bad food and the bad times.  There were lots of good times here too.  Sadly, the good is grossly outweighed by the bad.  I will miss it, but I think a swift sever is the best and only way to go.

YUM YUM YUM!  I LOVE gelato.  I also love the cheeky little nickname of this place "the G spot."    As far as the layout and service of this place goes, they really only deserve a couple stars.  The layout makes it very unclear where you are supposed to order and when this place is crowded, it can be a nightmare.  The kids behind the counter are more often than not just as confused as the customers and they just kind of hover around and wait to be pounced on.    The gelato here is outstanding.  It's all very fresh, and you can taste that.  My favorite flavor here is either the cheesecake or the bacio.  Good stuff.  Their fruit flavors are all excellent too, very sweet and tart at the same time.  They make great palate cleansers too.  Definitely a good place to try sometime, but make sure you are agressive and push your way to the front and ask for help if it's crowded.  Don't be afraid to ask for samples either.

FEZ is amazing.  Simply put.  Just as a forewarning, this place is definitely gay-friendly.  If you didn't know that already, you should probably ditch that rock you've been living under.  Maybe not the place to take your ultra-conservative family, unless you want a little entertainment.  Call me crazy, but whenever my husband and I go there, we are among the few straight people, and that counts against us.  Our service sucks when it is just us.  When we bring a large group, it's infinitely better.  Sometimes it is just downright funny to watch how the service changes from table to table, waiter to waiter.    Aside from that, the food at FEZ is downright PHENOMENAL!  This was the first place that I tried lamb, and I have been hooked ever since.  Order it medium and you get a wonderfully tender and flavorful sweet piece of meat, well 5 actually.  On top of that is a to die for pesto sauce that will linger on your breath for hours, even days.  Not necessarily the best, but totally worth it.  On the side is lots of roasted veggies, the carrots and potatoes being particularly good.  The Douxelle Burger is also a lovely choice, with the burger always being cooked exactly the way you ask for it.  The finely diced sauteed onions and mushrooms are perfectly done and a fantastic accompaniment to the super tangy whole grain mustard.  Served on a ciabatta roll, you can't ask for a better burger... Except maybe the FEZ burger according to many.  If you are in the mood for a salad, the Pest Caesar Salad with Pistachios is a great option.  It's a refreshing spin on a classic that is improved upon with the pistachios.  If the carnivore in you needs some love too, add the lamb, its amazing on top of this salad.  The Strawberry/Blueberry Cashew salad is also great.  The flavors combine seamlessly to create a perfectly fresh and fruity dining experience.  The salads here are big, be prepared to take some home if you order the big size.  I could go on and on about FEZ.  Everything here is great.  I really try to choose new items every time I go, but my old favorites keep calling me back.  Keep rockin' it FEZ

Yeah, so I was at FEZ for 5 hours last night.  We had some drinks and some food and a good time was had by all.  Service is always better when there is a group of 4 or more.  I noticed the look of the menu changed and that freaked me out.  My beloved lamb is more expensive than ever, but that isn't gonna stop me.  The tall attractive guy with the trendy glasses was a great server, but I am beyond remembering his name.  Just go!

There isn't much to say about Matt's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the Valley.  You have to appreciate a homegrown diner where the owner makes everyday appearances, his wife runs the place, and they use the best, freshest, local ingredients.  Kudos.  I get the Hog and Chick every single time I go, I never stray.  Eggs over medium, hash browns, wheat toast, and the best damn bacon ever.  Always perfect every time.  I have never tasted bacon so good in my life.  The hash browns are out of this world.  They get shredded super fine and are cooked up on the griddle in loads of butter.  The BEST.  If you want to seem cool and in the know, at lunch time order the Insider Burger.  It's a traditional burger smothered in cheese, bacon added, and topped with an egg.  My brother loves it.  Similar to a Royal Red Robin Burger, but obviously superior.  The only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast.  Bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait.  Simply put, this place is amazing.  I am so lucky to be so close to this place.  Sometimes to avoid the wait, my husband and I wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, head over for breakfast and beat the crowds.  After a hearty button bursting breakfast, we ride our bikes home and go back to sleep.  That is the life my friends.  You should try it.

I absolutely LOVED this place!  I really like Irish food and Seamus and the Turf get old after a while, so after work we decided to try Rosie's and I am so glad that we did.  When we walked in we were greeted warmly by a full blooded Irish woman and her charming accent was absolutely adorable.  We asked about the TV channels they had and she seated us in a booth with a view of a TV and directed us to the bartender to ask for the channels.  Unlike pretty much every other place in the valley, they actually had the soccer channel and they put it on just for us!  5 stars for having that channel.  BTW, congrats to the Seattle Sounders, the new US Open Cup Champs!  For dinner I ordered the shepherd's pie.  I've ordered that at pretty much every place that carries it, and I have to say that Rosie's has the best.  They put TONS of cheese on top and it stays nice and ooey gooey.  There was a perfect amount of mash to accompany the veggies and meat underneath.  It was really flavorful and savory.  Best of all, it was extremely comforting, exactly what I needed after a long day at work.  Bottom line, I love this place and it is now my go-to Irish restaurant.  It's only too bad that it isn't within walking distance like a couple other places.

I have a strange fascination with libraries.  I guess I just love what they are about.  I feel so lucky to have Burton Barr so close to my home.  I especially love that it's designed by Will Bruder.  You can see the similarities between this building and the ASU campus.  Anyway, besides the beautiful and seamless intertwining of the outdoors with the indoors, this library houses an enormous collection of resources.  There are multiple levels with both stairs and elevators to get you around.  There is a considerable sized computer lab that allows you to reserve a computer for an hour at a time using your library card.  You can find pretty much anything you could be looking for at this library.  It has a great selection of everything.  We are lucky to have such a cool place downtown.  Just watch out for the bums camping out in the area.

This is my mom's favorite breakfast place, so naturally we took her here in our Mother's Day celebration on Saturday.  We arrived at about 10:30 or so and as usual, the place was jam-packed and I could barely squeeze through the doors to get my name in.  We were quoted at about 20 minutes for a table of 3 and within 20 minutes we were seated.  Good, because I was starving.  There are quite a few things that appeal to me on their menu.  I am a big fan of their "heartier" pancakes.  You know, the kind that are loaded with nuts and berries and other healthy crap.  They are all very good.  This time I went with an omelet.  I chose the same thing as the husband did, a pear, bacon, sliced almond, and havarti creation.  I thought it sounded a little weird, but I am a sucker for bacon and havarti.  The omelet was delicious.  It was a generous portion and all of the flavors melded together beautifully.  I loved the differences in texture in every bite.  The omelet was also served with potatoes that are so-so and an english muffin.  By itself the english muffin was pretty lame, but if you add the apple cinnamon jelly that sits on the table, it's incredible.  I LOVED that jelly.  It was really really good, and I don't even like cinnamon.  The things that suck about this place are: the layout - it's very jumbled and sometimes I think the servers forget you; the servers outfits - I can't stand looking at the poor girls wearing high waisted khaki mom jeans, it's downright painful; the wait - whenever we come here, I am starving and it kills me to have to wait outside in the AZ heat.  Overall though, this is a nice place.  I enjoy coming here whenever we're out in the EV with my family.

Hmph... I had always wanted to try this spot, and living within walking distance for the past 3 years hasn't done much to change that, until now.  After catching a show at the Herberger, Ashley A. suggested we go here for drinks/food.  I wasn't really feeling it because I was scared of what I expected in terms of premium pricing, but we went anyway.  The elevator ride up was fun and it made my ears pop.  Once we got off the elevator though, things kind of stopped being fun and I felt like I just stepped into a closet.  It was so dark!  I will give the Compass one thing, their service is fantastic.  Unfortunately, service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices.  They didn't have Coke, which really irritated me, so I just had a water.  We ended up getting the Drunken Shrimp app since we weren't entirely hungry and then the Lava Cake for dessert.  The sauce with the shrimp was startlingly salty.  Even for me, and I oversalt everything.  The shrimp were okay, and there were only three.  Seriously?  20 bucks for 3 shrimp and a piece of bread.  Sheesh!  At least the desserts were priced fairly.  The lava cake was okay, but it doesn't even come close to my beloved Domino's Lava Crunch Cake.    After checking out the rather uninspired menu and it's awe inspiring prices, I won't be back.  Besides, the view from the top of the Chase Tower is much more impressive, so the view alone will not get me to come back.

I am beginning to think that the reason I love barbecue restaurants so much is the fact that I ALWAYS get two meals out of one visit.  That figures out, on average, to about 7-8 bucks a meal, and you can't really beat that for great food!  The husband and I decided to go here on Friday night, and the place was busy, but not so busy that we were able to be immediately seated.  Our service was fantastic.  I'm beginning to think that restaurants are recognizing our faces from our pictures because this was beyond good service.  Our server was super quick and very sweet.  Our food came out impossibly fast too.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the brisket platter, of course, and it was super yummy.  I got a big fat helping of tender brisket and two sides.  I chose the pecan cole slaw and the mac and cheese.  We also got cornbread with our meals.  The cornbread is really yummy, but strangely shaped into little disks.  The cole slaw was very good, with a great sweet flavor that was enhanced by the crunch of the pecans.  The mac and cheese was literally rib-stickin good.  It was the super thick and creamy kind that makes me weak in the knees.  The barbecue sauce served on the meat is fairly minimal, but they bring you plenty of extra so you don't have to worry.    I would definitely come back here.  I loved the food, the service and the atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend this for good sit down service BBQ.

I finally came to Ticoz, thus completing the holy trinity (FEZ, Switch, & Ticoz).  I liked it here, but not as much as the other two places.  First off, I LOVE the decor.  It's very cool and contemporary, but it has a warm Spanish flair that really suits the place.  The bar area is really cool, like the place where all the cool kids would hang out.  You would never expect any of this just by looking at the outside of the building.  For food, I ordered the Latin Passion salad which was a tasty mix of field greens and baby spinach topped with pinto beans, jack cheese, corn, tortilla strips, and mixed with a sweet and spicy tropical dressing.  You also get tomatoes and cilantro, but I opted out, yuck!  The salad was really big, and I only ordered the half size!  I definitely couldn't finish it.  The greens were all very fresh and all the toppings added lots of great textures and subtle flavors.  The dressing was really great.  I usually don't like spicy stuff, but I really enjoyed this dressing.  It was really light but the spice gave it a full flavor.  I also tasted some of the french fries and passion slaw that my Mom In Law had.  The slaw was really yummy and very different from the slaw you would expect.  The fries were okay, not really my favorite.  We also had a trio of salsas served to us before our meal and I tried two of them.  Again, I don't like tomatoes, so this is a bit uncommon.  One of the salsas was a pineapple salsa and it was delicious.  The sweet tangy flavor of the pineapple was perfect with the super salty tortilla chips.  I also tried the very spicy salsa that didn't have chunks of anything in it and it was also very good... in very small doses.  Overall, I liked Ticoz, but it isn't really my favorite kind of food.  I'm just too picky.  I will probably be back and hopefully I can expand my culinary horizons just a bit.

Famous Dave's is orgasmic BBQ.  I've never been too keen on BBQ just for the reason that it is always so freakin messy.  I don't like getting messy while I eat, because despite what your server thinks, the tiny little "wet nap" doesn't really do the trick.  Get the brisket platter with the cole slaw and the wilbur beans.  That is the best combination of food here.  I always use the Sweet & Sassy bbq sauce and my taste buds are translated directly to heaven.  All their other food is good too, I have never once been dissatisfied, but the brisket is the best.  I love how they leave like 6 different sauces at your table so you can play with them and mix and match.  It's totally the way to go.  Service has never been disappointing here.  They all know how to do their job well here, even when the place is jam packed, and it will be at dinner time.  If you want to get a real gut-busting meal that tastes delicious, go to Famous Dave's and hopefully you will have a food experience as mind blowing as mine always is.

Every time we take a trip to LA we always try to make a stop at Cafe Tu Tu Tango, our favorite tapas restaurants.  This is where I was introduced to the concept of small bites to share among friends.  I really love this concept and was hoping I could find something like that in Phoenix.  Sure enough, we have something like that in Phoenix, and it even has a communal table.  Yay!  We met a couple friends here one night and were sat near the end of the communal table, but in a rather odd configuration because the party next to us was a group of three.  In any event we were handed menus and we got down to business in selecting our food.  This was a little while ago, so I don't remember too well what we got, but I will do my best.  We chose the Serrano Ham with Cheese, a Shrimp dish similar to scampi, a Filet Mignon dish, and something else that I just cannot remember.  I am a big fan of artisan meat and cheese plates, especially ones with manchego cheese.  There was enough food on the plate to give all of us a little something to try and whet our appetites a bit.  The shrimp dish was amazing.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and sat in a pool of delicious garlicky-buttery goodness.  I wished there was more, but we all got a couple shrimp.  Finally, of what I remember, was the Filet Mignon dish.  I believe it was actually the special that night.  It was soooo decadent.  The meat was grilled to a beautiful medium and it was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork.  There were two cuts of meat served in this dish, so there was plenty to go around.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  If you are familiar with the concept of tapas and don't go in here with the mindset of traditional American dining (that you will be filled to the brim, pushing you past the point of gluttony) then you will love this place.  The communal table is lots of fun, and I guarantee you will meet someone new, especially if the alcohol is flowing.  Overall, a fantastic place to go catch up with friends and enjoy some wonderful food.

I grew up in the East Valley, and Joe's was pretty much a safe bet whenever you wanted good BBQ.  It's literally been years since I had been until just recently, when we went to celebrate a friend's birthday.    I've always loved the great old farm house style building that they're in along with the very large patio/picnic area in the back.  This is certainly a place where families can feel welcomed.  Once the weather gets down to normal temps at night, the patio would be wonderful.  For dinner I got the chopped brisket sandwich with a side of corn and a side of mac and cheese.  To drink, I got what I love this place for, Stewart's Key Lime Soda.  YUM!  The brisket was pretty good and since it was cooked in sauce, there was no shortage of sweet and tangy bbq flavor.  I didn't eat the bun because I was more concerned about stuffing my face with my sides.  The corn is really yummy.  It's crisp, sweet, and swimming in a buttery liquid.  The mac and cheese was also very good.  It was tender and super creamy and cheesy.  That's my kind of mac and cheese!    Overall, I really like this place, but it's too far out of the way to go very often, and the husband doesn't really care for it.  It of course has the issues, such as the crazy line, and the fact that a refill on your soda means cutting in line, but it's a pretty nice laid back place to go and grab some bbq in cute Old-Town Gilbert.

I certainly don't understand the hype over this place.  That's strike 2 for you Guy Fieri (#1 is Chino Bandido, bleh).  The layout of this restaurant is very strange, but I kind of like that they separate the large groups from the smaller groups of diners.  The staff, especially our server, was extremely accommodating and put up with our certainly frustrating antics of playing board games on the dinner table.    I was pretty hungry when we got here, so i decided to order something on the heavier side and went with the gnocchi.  The gnocchi were lightly pan fried and then drowned in a ridiculously rich cheese/cream sauce and sprinkled with chunks of pancetta and a handful of wild mushrooms.  The mushrooms tasted really weird for some reason and the sauce was too tangy.  It just didn't complement the dish the way it should have.  I did however, eat every last bit of pancetta.  Yum!  I saw a slice of German Chocolate Cake (no, it is not German in the least bit) being served to someone at another table and I gave the puppy dog eyes until we ordered it.  It came out looking rather impressive, but it went down tasting rather dull.  It was dry and lifeless and the only good part, the coconut pecan icing, was severely lacking.  Well, I won't be back here, especially after most of my companions were less than enthused with their meals instead.  Oh well, I guess that will make everyone else happy.

This place is pretty awesome.  It truly feels like the local hangout/diner that everyone wishes they had in their neighborhood.  It was really awesome to look around and see the wide range of clientele in here and it makes for some killer people watching while dining, my favorite.    The menu here isn't terribly inventive, but you shouldn't expect it to be.  I chose the Cowboy Scramble, or something similarly named, which was eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, and hash browns all scrambled together.  Literally, it was all scrambled, not just layered.  It wasn't the prettiest dish to behold, but it was pretty tasty, and I would definitely order it again.  It tasted fantastic and was incredibly filling.  I only got about halfway through it.  I will definitely come back here again.  Service is good, the location is good, the food is good, and best of all, they have a decent parking situation.  Yay!

I love Italian food.  I'm lucky enough to be married to an Italian, so I get the good stuff every day.  Oh yeah.  However, he hates cream sauces and rarely if ever makes them, so whenever we go out, I make sure to order them.    My first time at Harley's I ordered the pesto gnocchi.  OMG! Heaven in my mouth.  It is so filling though, I can only finish it if I am being a glutton.  potato dumplings are always nice and firm, never overcooked and mushy.  I heard there is a rosa sauce that you can get this with, but I could never give up my pesto cream.  Yum.  Another time I tried the tortelloni, or maybe it was tortellini, not sure which and it came with the alfredo sauce.  The pasta was good, but the sauce was just weird.  It was really really sweet.  I am accustomed to sweet sauces, as my husband usually adds brown sugar to whatever he's making, but this was definitely something else.  I don't really know.  Maybe it was a funky batch.    I've sampled a few of their apps before and they are all wonderful.  The fried mashed potato balls are wicked good, as is the asparagus cartucho (I think).  The bistro bread is also another favorite of mine.  Harley's is really a great place to go.  The prices are a little high, but cheaper than other comparable Italian eateries.  This place is a gem in the Melrose district.

I am such a customization freak when it comes to food, so I get really really excited whenever we go to a place that let's me pick out all of my toppings, no matter how weird they seem to be.  The husband and I actually only came here because Baby Kay's was closed, but that was perfectly fine with me.  We had actually been here once before when we were first dating and we had breakfast here.  I remember it being pretty good.  The menu offers you quite a few options.  There are salads, preset pizza flavors, and then the oh-so-awesome make your own pizza exactly the way you want it option.  Obviously I chose the latter.  First I had to choose between a white, wheat, or gluten-free pizza crust.  I chose wheat.  Then you can pick a seasoning.  I went for Italian.  Then you get a sauce choice, I chose alfredo but there were like 7 other options.  Then comes the cheese, and I picked the white cheese mix, which is a combo of mozzarella, provolone, and parmesan.  Finally, the toppings.  There are so many to choose from it's amazing.  I limited myself to mushrooms, asparagus, italian sausage, and bacon.  Let me tell you, this pizza was amazing.  It may not be your dream, but it was heaven to me.  I love this place, it's totally awesome.  It's hard to go wrong when you customize something exactly for yourself.  Definitely give this place a try sometime, it's totally worth it.

As strange as it may seem, I'm pretty sure there were more adults than kids here.  Amazing Jake's is a great place for food, fun, and some sports on the tv.  They have all sorts of silly themed rooms to eat your food in, my favorite (and my husband's favorite) being the sports themed room.  They have a giant projection screen in there where they usually play games on.  The food here is pretty decent.  I am kind of a fan of terrible buffet/cafeteria style food, and AJ's hits it right on the head here.  Yum.  Don't come expecting amazing food.  There is also, of course, a giant area with tons of fun arcade games to make you feel like a kid again.  I had a blast when I went here with my husband.  Amazing Jake's is definitely a fun place to forget about the outside world and be like a kid again.

I really really like Frances.  I love most of the clothes in there, but I can never have them because I can't afford it.  The store in general is pretty cool, there are lots of neat things in here from stationery to clothes to jewelry to baby stuff to dog stuff to vintage stuff.  There is a lot of stuff here.  It's all quite pricey though.  The sales they have every now and then are sorta okay, but still break the bank if you buy anything.  Overall they carry good quality products and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  I can't hate on a place too bad just because I can't afford it.

In some thread a long time ago, Amy D said this place was way better than China Chili.  I was dubious to say the least.  We decided to try it for take out one night and see if the strange little place next to FEZ was good or not.  Well, my verdict is it's pretty great!  Not China Chili Orange Chicken spicy ok great, but it was really yummy.  When we ordered, my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I ordered, and consequently ate, way too much.  I got a small order of egg flower soup, which is actually pretty big, and the Honey Walnut Shrimp Dinner Combo.  Just saying that is a mouthful.  Anyway, the fried rice that came with the combo was just meh.  The Chicken Lo Mein was really tasty and could be a stand alone dish.  The Egg Rolls were really yummy and if I hadn't eaten too much already I would have ate the other one I traded for Crab Puffs.  I hate crab puffs so I didn't eat them.  The shrimp were yummy!  They don't have any breading or anything so that was a big plus and the totally bad for you sweet and tangy mayo sauce was awesome.  The walnuts were good too.  The best part of my meal though was the Egg Flower Soup.  It was FANTASTIC!  I've been dying to find a really good egg drop/flower soup for a long time now, because it's my favorite thing to eat when I'm sick.  I have finally found it.  I will most definitely be getting take out from Siu Wok again, and probably many many many more orders of soup.

From the day I got my dog Rally, I knew I was going to treat him like my baby.  I only want the best for him, after all, he is my baby.  Walking in to Wag N' Wash you are transported to a place where pets are the number one priority.  The owners recognize you and tell you welcome back.  They are extremely helpful and offer to help you make selections if they notice you lingering in a particular section like I always do.  The selection of food is relatively small, but all the food is far superior to what you would find at any other pet store.  Nothing but the best for our pets in this store.  They even offer a list that tells you what ingredients to look for and which ones to avoid when it comes to choosing food for your four legged friend.  There are tons of fun toys to choose from and the staff is happy to offer recommendations.  Although, if you have a super chewer like we do, stick with the solid rubber toys.  You do have to remember though, that with high quality comes a proportional price in the dog toy world.  I LOVE the washing stations in the back.  It's always a lot of fun to take my Monstah there and scrub him down with the high quality shampoos and temperature controlled water.  I think he likes it too.  There are three levels of washing available.  With the Basic, you do all the scrubbing and use house shampoo.  The next level up you do all the scrubbing but you have your choice of premium shampoos.  The highest level offers the convenience of a self scrubbing nozzle and your choice of premium shampoos.  The prices are decent considering you're doing most of the work.  However I will pay a premium not to clean up after the mess.  Bottom line, if you love your pet and only want the best, go to Wag N' Wash.  You will not regret it.

I used to hate places like these.  Then I grew up.  Then I understood the beauty of age and old school.  I've come to appreciate places like these even more now that I am making more of an effort to reuse or repurpose along with supporting my local economy.    This place is so much fun to go treasure hunting.  From the front it doesn't look that big, but the inside is so expansive, holding so much stuff you don't even know where to begin.  There is no real organization here except for the back where you can find a pile of old wooden signs and a room full of old windows.  This just makes the hunt more fun.  If you are looking to kill some time, stop by and check out the eclectic but wide assortment of findings and treasures here.  Be sure to wipe your shoes... AFTER you leave.  You will get dusty.

I happen to really like this place even if it is just to look at stuff but never buy.  Inside you will find a rather well organized store with lots of fun pieces to look at.  From what I gathered, it is mostly French and Asian inspired.  However, I can't quite figure out if I am actually looking or if everything is brand new but made in the shabby chic style.  This is a cool store and it is moderately priced but I don't get to go often because the husband doesn't like it.  If you are shopping for French, Asian, or Iron pieces, I suggest stopping by Figs, you probably won't be disappointed.

Ha!  I totally thought I reviewed this place, but I must have confused it with Desert Sky Mall instead.  Can you blame me?  This mall is marginally better, but we still fondly refer to it as "GhettroCenter."  The clientele here is fairly shady, so you better not be afraid to mingle with them.  The food court is trying really hard to be cool, and they do succeed with the really cool Phoenix map by the bathrooms, other than that the food selection kind of sucks and the layout seems kind of silly.  As far as the store selection goes, it's very average.  Overall, it's not the WORST mall to go to, but I generally try to avoid it.

The husband and I have been doing lots of second hand shopping lately in attempts to do an eco/recession friendly redesign in our bathroom.  We stopped by Flo's looking for items to decorate with, and unfortunately we only found green tea lights.  This place is great though.  It's refreshing to walk into a second hand store and not be bombarded with the usual toxic scent of moth balls and death.  This was no Goodwill.  Instead, we were greeted by a couple cashiers the second we walked in the door.  The store was very well organized, and I didn't have to fight my way through aisles of dirty clothes to find things.  You can find high quality home decor on the right and left of the store.  Nice clothing is organized neatly on multiple small clothing racks.  I didn't have a lot of time to rifle through the clothes, but I did see a good number of cute things I wouldn't mind adding to my wardrobe.  The main drawback is that I saw a couch in here that I instantly wanted to buy.  It was a beautiful rust color with gorgeous curves and a modern flair.  Unfortunately, this was part of the store's furniture.  Read: Not for sale.  Boo.  Maybe next time I will just ask where they bought it.  If you are looking for high quality second hand items and knowledgeable friendly staff, I highly recommend stopping by Flo's.  You won't leave this place feeling like you narrowly escaped the fumes of death.

Bleh.  I do not like this location at all!  I normally don't have anything bad to say about AMC Theatres, but this one just makes me mad.  First of all, the bathrooms are terrible!  They are way too small and somehow manage to look like they're 30 years old!  I also hate the location of this one with all the awful chains around (not awful because they're chains, but awful because their food/product is awful).  The actual theatres are not the nicest and could use a bit more thorough cleaning after each show.  The seats are strangely small.  I feel like they ordered the wrong chairs for this one because they don't feel like any of the other AMC's that I've been to.  Last but not least, this theatre is entirely over-run by children.  They are everywhere and their parents don't seem to care how their screaming and whining bothers other people.  Ugh.  I won't come back unless I have to.

I love bagels with cream cheese.  Especially a honey whole wheat bagel toasted with honey almond cream cheese loaded on.  Yum.  My husband and I frequent this location as it is just a short bike ride from our house and it is a FANTASTIC place to people watch both outside on the patio and on the couches inside the hotel.  Their selection is a bit smaller than the normal Einstein's as this is one of their "Express" locations.  Also, as their website points out, the Express locations do not accept gift cards, so don't expect them to and only give them one star based on that single fact.  There is a bigger on on 7th st and McDowell if you want to use that gift card.  Anyway, the smaller selection actually makes for a speedier trip through the line, because those indecisive people you always get stuck behind have less to choose from.  The staff is usually decent, sometimes a little less than friendly, but never rude.  I always get my stuff quickly, and they've never messed it up.  If you are downtown and need a bite to eat and want a little entertainment while you are at it, stop by here.  By the way, this location is on 2nd St NOT Ave.

I really like this Einstein's.  Maybe it's because they work inside a hotel, but the staff here is so much more competent than some other locations.  My order is always correct and I never leave disappointed.  The breakfast bagels are good here and are a pretty decent value.  They are pretty consistent here, but sometimes I get a little shafted on the amount of cream cheese I get and sometimes my bagel is less toasted than I think it should be.  Otherwise, great location!

First things first, don't visit this place on a First Friday, that would be a mistake.  Every other day you will be free to browse this cozy little store at your own pace and with your very own bubble of personal space.  Made carries a rather interesting selection of items.  They have a variety of screen printed T-Shirts in the back along with a fairly extensive magazine collection and a smattering of handmade pottery across from that.  In the same vicinity you will find cleverly crafted jewelry to fit most budgets and styles.  The store also carries items like handmade purses and scarves all made by local designers.  There is also a rather interesting mish mash of funny and interesting books that make great gifts for the hard to buy for person.   I like having a great place like Made in my neighborhood.  Businesses that support local artists will most definitely get my business, especially when the carry such fun and interesting products like this lovely boutique.

Well... to sum it all up, I will tell you a short story.  My husband and our families went to the FQ Story Home Tour a short while back.  In one of the beautiful homes on the tour we were bombarded with lots and lots of artwork depicting naked men.  Lots of highly detailed sculpted peen to go around.  The owner of that home very clearly got his stuff from EXPOSED.  I guess that isn't surprising considering the name of this fun and eclectic gallery.  We stopped in one day simply because we were in the area shopping for vintage.  We weren't looking for anything to buy at all, we just wanted to look.  As soon as we walked in our eyes were met with a kaleidoscope of colors in the form of sculpted glass.  You will find lots and lots of that here.  You will also find lots of naked men things.  They even sell penis shaped stones at the counter you pay at! HA!  I'm immature, I know.  Anyway, there are also some incredible sculptures, including one that gets displayed out front, that are made of common tools.  Very creative and beautiful.  If I had the money, I would buy the phoenix/angel looking one out front.    The owner of the store is super friendly and helpful.  He asked why were in there and listened to us explain that we wanted local or recycled or hopefully both.  After walking us around and showing us particular pieces, he let us be.  I found these beautiful glass wall pocket things along one of the walls.  They are small pieces of glass with a little pocket formed on the front.  It's large enough to put a single flower in there.    I really like this place.  Lots of fun an interesting stuff to look at.  The prices are also surprisingly low, especially considering the arm and a leg that some "artists" feel they are entitled to charge.

Since the husband and I have finally decided that we've exhausted our choices of restaurants in PHX (mostly due to me being so finicky) we have pushed our restaurant search a little further out of the city.  This search led us out to CK's Tavern and Grill.  My first impression was that this place was nuts!  There was a rather raucous crowd on the patio watching the Suns game, and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  Inside wasn't much different, with most tables being occupied, but a couple were quickly cleared off to make room for us.    We only sat down for a minute or so before our super efficient server came by.  I really like watching servers and seeing how they do their job, because frankly, there aren't very many good ones anymore.  This girl was awesome.  She didn't do one single thing without doing three others at the same time.  If she was bringing our drinks, she was also bringing the check for the table next to us and the drinks for the group on the other side.  She was awesome.  It actually seemed that most of the other servers did this too.  They must do some awesome training camps here or something.  Anyway, we each ordered a dozen wings, I got the honey and I tried the husband's raspberry chipotle.  We also got an order of beer fries just in case.  The fries were great and super crispy and we got a big fat side of ranch with it.  The wings were searingly hot and when I finally got to bite into them, they were pretty good.  The honey one's are literally just that, honey.  It was a nice alternative to the heavier stuff.  The raspberry chipotle sauce was pretty tasty, but not my favorite.  Meanwhile, after I ate most my wings, I decided I wanted more fries.  They were no longer hot, but surprisingly, they were still crispy and tasty.  Sweet.  We will most certainly come back here if we're in this part of town.  When you group a really fun atmosphere with a million TV's and awesome service, you definitely get my vote.

I've been to a Sprout's before, but that was quite a while ago, so on my recent visit I was really pleased with what I was presented with!  I like the layout of the store.  It's definitely a little different than your typical grocery store, but it makes sense.  I also like that their aisles are very short, so you don't have to break your neck to see what's at the top.  I loved their selection of produce and I really liked seeing a lot of local offerings.  The carrots from Tolleson are very good.  Some of their produce prices, like on apples, are unbelievably cheap compared to other grocery stores!  I had a lot of fun browsing this store and everything they have to offer, and I think we might be adding Sprouts to our weekly grocery trips.

Hooray for awesome vintage stores!  Michael Todd's is definitely one of the better vintage stores.  Everytime we drive along Camelback, and the mood strikes us, we swerve into the parking lot of this place, sometimes almost causing accidents.  In our effort to redo our bathroom in vintage/recycled items we stopped by here in hopes of finding some inspiration.  This time, we struck it rich.  I found a beautiful vintage French mirror here, and the quality of the mirror is still pretty good.  It only cost like 30 bucks!  Other places, ahem, Melrose Vintage, this exact mirror would cost me about 100 bucks.  This store has a great assortment of furniture, clothing, and knick knacks to suit everyone's taste.  Even if I don't buy anything, I always walk out with a smile on my face.

We really enjoy coming to this park.  It's a really large open area with tons of room for the dogs to run.  The grass is pretty crappy, but that's what happens when dogs trample it all day long.  There are a few benches for the people to sit on, and quite a few plastic chairs, but beware, the dogs love to mark those.  There is usually a fair amount of shade to cool off in during the hotter days.  The only drawback is that there seems to be a lot of newcomers here who don't understand that you have to pick up after your dog.   In any event, a pretty great dog park that usually has a good crowd, but not too much.  Oh, they also have a completely separate area for all the annoying yippy little dogs.

Ghetto!  You know, I realize we live in Arizona and grass is hard enough to grow in our ridiculously harsh climate, and having dogs trample all over it all day makes it even harder.  That being said, I have visited many dog parks with grass.  So, can someone explain to my why this dog park is 100% gravel?  I'm not even sure it's all gravel, I think there may be some needles and broken glass mixed up in there.  The place is all sorts of hilly with nasty scratchy bushes everywhere.  Our dog, Rally, did not care for this place at all.  After sniffing the perimeter, he came back and laid down next to us.  Also not a good place for people, as there is only one bench and very, very minimal shade.

This place is too cool for its own good.  It is definitely where the "cool dogs" go to play.  Unfortunately we don't make it out here very often because it's all the way in the EV and we live in Downtown, but Rally LOVES it when we take him here.  The parking situation is a little bit annoying, but I will put up with it when there is such a great park to go to.  Here you are offered a big lake area for the dogs to swim in, a nice beach area to frollick in, and a big grassy area to run in and practice on the obstacles.  I've heard some complaints that it's really dirty here, but I have never seen that, thankfully.  This park is beautiful and well maintained.  Arizona dogs are lucky to have this park in their backyard.

I don't really know what to say about this place.  For starters, it's a trip.  It's pretty hilarious too.  We happened to come in on the day that the owner was speaking to her very old mother on the phone cursing up a storm and getting irritated.  She used us as an excuse to get off the phone.  After a brief little chat with her we discovered that the chaos is mostly due to the fact that she will be opening up a small theatre in the back of the store complete with it's own entrance.  They will be screening crazy old B-Movies and will be taking requests on the website.  Anyway, for a bit of entertainment, stop in this crazy little shop.  There are all sorts of fun oddities to amuse you and the eccentric owner is a bonus too.

I really do hate Mexican food.  I'm too picky to enjoy the massive amounts of pepper flavors and onions that permeate this type of food.  However, there is one place on earth that I would choose to get Mexican food any day of the week.  Bajio!  I was actually introduced to this place while I was in Utah and was ecstatic to find it here in AZ.  There used to be one on Stapley that we went practically every time we went out to the EV.  Unfortunately, that location is no longer.  Anyway, Bajio prepares high quality and flavorful food that doesn't break the bank.  My favorite items are the ones with the shrimp.  Just trust me and get it, you can thank me later.  Their salads are also really great and a nice alternative to the heavier fare.  I really wish that Bajio would come downtown and make my dreams come true, but until then, I guess I'll have to make the trek up here to get it.

Phoenix has needed this for so long.  I've lived with the construction and put up with it for so long that it would be silly to not use it.  It's great to use to head over to the airport for a lovely evening of Paradise Bakery and people watching.  It's great to use for a long night of drinking at FEZ so you only have to stumble to the stop in order to get home safely.  It's nice because it can get my little bro out from the East Valley to see me because heaven knows the boy couldn't navigate his way to Downtown Phoenix.  It's clean, it's somewhat efficient, and it doesn't take too long.  Only on rare occasions does it smell.  That's usually only when you get on the same train as all the construction workers who just got off work.  I'm glad to have this in Phoenix and I am excited to see the future plans for extending it.  Let's see how the summer goes.  p.s. I would love it if there were a last call train that started at each end at 2:00AM.

After a long search for an acceptable wedding reception venue, we checked out the Arizona Club.  Yes, we had to buy a membership that we never used again just so we could use this place, but I LOVED it!  The view is breathtaking and we can see our house from it.  The sunset view is spectacular.  I was especially pleased with the customer service we were given while planning everything.  Spencer was the guy who helped us, and he was fantastic.  He reminded me of Dwight Schrute, just not as smart-ass.  All the staff was super helpful the day of the event, and the food was wonderful.  We actually found it to be one of the better values out of all our searching.  I would definitely love to go to another event here, one that's not my own.

This place is simply amazing!  I wish every breakfast place would model themselves after AZ Bread Co!  This place is ultra bright and cheery, which is so perfect for the morning.  There are tons of tables and chairs, so you'll be hard pressed to not find a seat.  The ordering system is perfect for breakfast, you place your order, get a number, and sit down.  The drinks are self serve so it's really nice to not have to wait for any servers when you are STARVING like I always am at breakfast time.  Everyone who works here is quick and efficient, running like a well oiled machine.  Now the food....  Do yourself a HUGE favor and get over here on the weekend!  They advertise a pecan waffle, pancake, or french toast special here on yelp.  I decided I would have that.  BEST DECISION EVER!  It was so amazingly good.  The waffle was fluffy and sweet and the pecan compote was dreamy.  Just imagine loads of caramelly sweet crunchiness covering an already perfect waffle.  Are you in heaven now?  You should be.  I promise it will be mind blowing.  I kind of love this place, as if you couldn't tell already.  I am going to be trying to find excuses to make our way down here more often!

I am a big fan of Bookman's.  This is THE go-to place for used books, music, magazines, and even video games.  My mom used to bring me here all the time when I was a kid reading all the Goosebumps books because they always had at least one book out of the series that I was dying to get my hands on.  Then I graduated to the Animorphs series... I totally miss that.  Again, they always had what I was looking for, and always at under 4 bucks!  Unbeatable.  I don't come here as often anymore because I have one of those fancy eReaders and my husband downloads books for me, but I will probably stop by sometime to check out their cookbook selection.  I've always found the staff to be pretty helpful too.  The best part is, when you go to trade in your books they always give you a fair and honest deal, allowing you to trade for cash or in-store credit.  Hooray for used book stores!

The first time I tried Hungry Howie's was all the way in Florida while I was on vacation.  It was late, we were hungry, and Hungry Howie's was close.  They were almost closed but they accommodated us and hooked us up with some wicked delicious pizza.  That's when I got hooked.   We ordered some HH pizza the other night because we were feeling lazy.  We got 1 small bacon cheeseburger pizza (mozzarella, cheddar, bacon, and hamburger) and 1 philly cheesteak pizza (cheese sauce, steak, peppers, mushrooms, onions, and provolone cheese).  These were so delicious, we completely scarfed them down.  Gluttonous, yes but totally worth it.  HH is everything a pizza place should be, cheap, fast, and delicious.  I only take away one star because they are not closer to downtown.

Hands down this is the best game store in the Valley.  I guarantee you will not find a better store with a better experience.  The layout of the store is very large and open with tables set up in the middle and all the games along the outside.  They also have books/magazines/comic books under all the games and a pretty impressive (to me) collection of all the little figurines people play games with.  The selection of games is very nice.  There is a little of everything and practically every expansion pack known to man can be found here.  The owner is so incredibly friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable that he just makes me want to spend more and more money here (over $200 spent already!)  Quite possibly the greatest thing about this store is that if they don't have a game you want, the owner will look it up and order it for you on the spot.  I just love this place, but it is dangerous for us.  I could never say enough positive things about it.

I've been to this location a few times.  They have a nice selection of lighting to pretty much suit everyone's tastes, but unless you are old and look like you are going to spend loads of money, don't expect any sort of service.  The last and final time my husband and I went here, we were intending to purchase some track lighting.  We actually found some stuff we really liked after about 10 minutes and we waited around that area hoping that someone could help us with some questions.  Well, 15 minutes later, that never happened, but new people were helped.  We got in line, seriously, to ask a question.  After our question was answered, instead of sending an associate to help us with our purchase, we were ignored again.  So we tried finding someone else on the floor.  No luck.  Apparently, because we are in our 20's we were just window shopping and not planning on dropping a few hundred dollars on lighting.  Needless to say, we didn't purchase anything in this awful store, and instead left pissed off.  On our way out we had to resist the urge not to trash anything and everything in sight.  Bottom line, go here with your grandparents if you want service, otherwise, go elsewhere.  THE WORST!

I never have high expectations for sports bars, there isn't any reason to.  Walking in to Oggi's, I felt no different than I do walking in to any other similar establishment.  We came in and were seated in a half full restaurant.  The bar area was fairly busy as there was a game going on.  The food is really not good.  Everything is quite greasy, and not in a good way.  Trust me, I like greasy.  They were also out of multiple menu items and a couple beers.  Of course, they didn't inform us of that beforehand, so  when I ordered the dish I wanted, I was told no, then my husband ordered what he wanted and told no again!  JEEZ!  I guess they have never heard of prepping.  I finally settled on the fettucini alfredo, as it's a simple dish and hard to screw up.  Well, they did.  It's all very generic, and the pasta was overcooked and mushy.  Ugh.  Service was so-so.  I will not be back, simple as that.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.

Yay for good Blockbusters.  There is one way closer to the house, but their selection sucks, the people are rude, and it's just plain ghetto.  This location is very large and has a great selection.  I think their selection is better than most.  The employees we have interacted with have always been very friendly and have a good sense of humor.  We actually have the Blockbuster online thing (think Netflix) and it works fantastically.  Whenever we come here to use one of our in-store exchanges, we are always in and out of there very quickly.  The other location seemed to have difficulties with that.  Anyway, this is my favorite Blockbuster in the valley.  The two reasons I subtracted one star is the awful parking lot, and I wish it were a bit closer to my house.

There's this Chinese math teacher at the school I work at (I know, how cliche right?) and he's been telling me all year that I HAVE to go here, and that it's the most authentic Chinese food around town.  So finally, I did.  I have no idea about authenticity, but I do know it was delicious and cheap.  It was pretty crowded on the day we came in, but we found our own seat and waited a few minutes before menus were brought to us.  There are about a billion choices, all of them priced well under 10 bucks.  This place simply cannot be beat for value.    Absolutely clueless about what to order, I stuck with what I knew, and got the Orange Chicken Bowl, an egg roll and a can of soda that only cost 92 cents.  Our food didn't take too long, and my egg roll came out first.  It was so tasty!  It was packed full of good stuff and the sauce to dip it in was quite good.  My Orange Chicken Bowl came out in the shape of a plate.  I thought that was odd, but who really cares.  The orange chicken was really good.  It had a bright flavor and the sauce was just thick enough to cover the chicken properly.  The fried rice was the best fried rice I have ever had.  I still think about it actually.  I would definitely love to come back to this place, especially since it is right by the Light Rail.  Hopefully I will be better prepared to order something a little more adventurous next time.

I do not like this Dave & Buster's.  Let me start by saying I am a ridiculous, goofy, immature big kid at heart.  I LOVE arcades and the only thing I love more than that is winning tickets to spend in the prize store.  This location makes me mad though.  Just because I act like a kid does not mean I want to be rubbing elbows with your little rugrats.  I know this is a kid friendly place during the day, but for goodness sakes make them behave!  There are screaming rude children all over here!  I was playing one game while being poked and prodded by a 5 year old wielding a balloon sword.  Not cool buddy.  If you want to let your kids run and scream and misbehave, take them to Chuck E Cheese or Peter Piper, but D&B's is not appropriate for that.  I should also point out that a lot of their machines "forget" to pay out and a good portion of them will just rip you off in general.  I also hate that I have to go upstairs to go to the main event.  That's not cool at all.  I hate this D&B and I will not go back.

This is, by far, the best theater in the valley.  I am SO lucky to have it just a short walk from my house.  A year or so ago there was NEVER anyone here.  We could go to a new movie on it's opening night at the prime time of movie going and be the only ones in the theater.  It's not like that so much anymore with ASU being downtown, but we can still catch movies at the last minute and get seats.  Even though the place has gotten a little more crowded, I still love it.  The ticket takers are always pleasant, especially the lady on Sunday mornings.  (she reminds me of Dexter's friend who just died on the show Dexter)  The theater also has good deals for early morning movies, hooray 5 dollar movie tickets!  Bathrooms are always clean, the theaters are always clean, and the staff is usually pretty efficient.  An added bonus is that every now and then our humble little theater is blessed with the opportunity of showing a limited release movie.  Yay!  A great theater in a great location with a great staff, it's hard to go wrong.

I really love to go to Haus and just browse because Lord knows I cannot afford anything in here.  I can't imagine there are too many people who actually can.  That being said, Haus carries some really great, high-quality products.  I've actually purchased quite a few items from here, most of them being kitschy Alessi products.  I did purchase a book about Poo here for my little bro.  The stuff here ranges from couches to tables to home accessories.  If you are looking for an interesting and original gift, you should definitely check this place out, as their small item selection is great.

This is our go-to spot for breakfast whenever we are making the early trip out to California.  The place is located in a run of the mill strip mall out in Avondale, and it is pretty easy to get to from the freeway.  The bagel selection here is pretty good, rivaling that of the other well known bagel places.  My favorite bagel here is the honey oat.  The nice thing I have noticed is they make the bagels in small batches so you are guaranteed the freshest bagel.  The breakfast sandwiches are pretty good and extremely filling.  The cream cheese selection is also pretty decent, but don't expect any of those light and fluffy types.  If you are out and about in this part of town and feel like a bagel, you should give this place a try.  The staff is always nice and friendly and you never have to wait too long.

I was pleasantly surprised with this place!  Kierland is really uppity in my mind, so I tend to shy away from all their dining options.  Too fancy schmancy for me!  However, after a long day of shopping and browsing the crazy ridiculous Sur La Table, we were getting really hungry.  Chloe's Corner was on our way back to the car so we decided to stop in.  The layout of the place is really cute, and almost retro.  The decor is very tasteful and bright feeling.  We browsed the giant chalkboard menu for a few moments before sitting down and ordering.  I chose the Grilled Ham and Cheese.  It was so DELICIOUS!  It was probably the best grilled sandwich I have ever had, aside from my own.  It was so buttery and toasty on the outside and it had the most amazing crunch.  There was a ton of yummy ham inside with a nice pairing of gooey cheddar cheese.  It was really a great sandwich.  Overall, I really liked this place and would definitely go back if I were in the area.

Now, I don't really understand the whole sub-culture that is obsessed with this stuff, but I can certainly appreciate it.  RHR is a great little store with a pretty diverse assortment of big kid toys.  Sometimes the stuff is really cute, and sometimes the stuff is a little disturbing, but that's how it should be.  My favorite part about this place is their rather impressive collection of Ugly Dolls.  Those little guys are my favorite.  The guys who I have seen work here are nice enough, but they won't really speak to you unless they are spoken to.  It could be worse.  RHR is definitely a cool place to bring out the geeky kid in you.

Switch... I really miss you.  My four stars are based completely on your food.  If I were to factor in the horrendous service I experienced the last three or four times I was there, there would maybe be one star left.  Being huge fans of FEZ, my husband and I made sure to try Switch.  We went many many times, bringing different people with us every time.  We were proud to call Switch our new hangout.  The Turkey Mac and Cheese was pure heaven, and we ordered it nearly every time.  The sandwiches are always delicious and many of them creative.  The galettes are amazingly delicious with all their flaky yumminess.  There was something new and yummy to try every time we went.  Then we brought my family.  The restaurant was about 2/3 full as it was a Friday night.  Our party of 5 sat at the long high top towards the kitchen.  After being completely ignored for a good 10 minutes, a highly irritable waitress rudely took our order... for drinks only.  She ran off before we could order dinner.  Another long 10 minutes or so, she brought back our drinks and impatiently took our order.  Allowing what seemed to be an eternity to pass, we got tired of being nice and asked someone why we had not been served our food after another 40 minutes or so.  Unacceptable at a restaurant.  The waitress never came back to ask if we wanted anything else or if everything was good or not.  She was entirely too busy flirting with the bartender to pay any attention to us.  We debated dining and dashing, but not really because my parents were with us, and that would be bad...  We paid our bill, and left a tip that sent a message.  I'm sure things have changed since then, it's been a really really long time.  That awful waitress has most likely left, and I am sure most of the early problems have all been hashed out.  Switch, I miss you.  Maybe I can convince the husband to let me see you again.

We finally came back to Switch and I am sooooo glad we did.  This time we got a fantastic server, Maria, and she definitely knows how to do her job well.  She was attentive and friendly and didn't linger around or avoid us.  I had the mac and cheese of course, which is fantastic, and we ordered the lobster crab puffs as an app.  That stuff is phenomenal!  I really liked it.  It's not very often that you get actual chunks of crab or lobster meat when you order something like this at other restaurants, it's usually unidentifiable mush. I'm glad I can put Switch back up to the 5 star that I have always wanted to give them.  One more experience like the last and I will most certainly resume my near constant appearance at this lovely restaurant.

This is one among the VERY few places I have gone to eat in Scottsdale.  We stopped in at late lunchtime on a weekend, and it was quite busy, but there was space for us to sit on the patio.  The decor was cool and sleek, and the staff was all pretty upbeat and friendly.  The friendliness of the staff was definitely a surprise to me in uber-trendyville.    Since it was our first time here, my husband and I ordered a few different things to share so we could try more stuff.  We ordered a buffalo and a lamb burger, tater tots, and the mac and jack.  One of the things I instantly loved about this place was the customization options.  You ordered the burger meat, and then any cheese or other toppings.  I made a delicious creation with lamb, swiss, bacon and mushrooms.  Yeah baby.  As for the rest of the food, the tots were nice and crispy with the perfect amount of salt.  The mac and jack was also delicious.  The buffalo, I was a little less than pleased with, as I think they overcooked it.  Buffalo is such a lean meat that just a second too long on the grill will dry it out.    The food was great, the service is good, the people watching is killer.  I really really liked this place, and I would certainly go back if I am in the area.

This is the type of place that Phoenix needs more of.  Their selection of clothing is great for both Men and Women.  I stopped in here on a First Friday right before our Arizona Winter came along.  I spotted a bright mustard yellow 3 button, 3/4 sleeve flouncy jacket.  I couldn't live without it.  It was soft and cozy but PERFECT for Arizona weather.  I bought it immediately, lending 110 dollars to our local economy.  I have worn this thing non-stop for the past few months.  Point being the clothes here are very high quality, fashion forward, but not trendy.  They don't stock a lot of everything, so you don't end up seeing every girl on the street looking just like you.  Plus, the owners are great.  Bunky, thanks for making Downtown Phoenix your home.

I may be 22 (right now) but I still am, and probably always will be, an immature kid at heart.  Dave and Buster's is really the grown up version of Chuck E. Cheese.  They've got a bar, a full service restaurant, and lots and lots of games.  YAY!  The husband and I decided to try the place for dinner sometime after watching one of those stupid commercials that promises you dinner and games for 15 bucks.  Unfortunately, there is a catch to that which is only Sunday - Thursday (open to close) and Friday and Saturday until 5 pm.  Oh well, I wasn't that put out, I just spent more money.  I got some sort of bbq dish because it said it used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  It didn't but it still tasted pretty good.  It also came with a big fat pile of onion strings, which is on of my ultimate weaknesses.  My knees get all wobbly at the thought.  The service in the "restaurant" section is decent.  Nothing to write home about, but they do their job right.  That's all I can ask really.  The game selection is pretty awesome.  They have the most recent versions of House of the Dead and Time Crisis, so I was pretty damn happy.  Of course they have the usual Skee Ball and Basketball games too.  Overall, a pretty decent value considering how much arcade games have inflated their prices.  D&B's is a fun place to go.  I've never been with a group, but I imagine with a couple libations and a fully loaded game card, it could be a wicked awesome night there.  Watch out though, it seems to get packed every Saturday night.

In comparison to the other Dave & Busters, this one is HEAVEN!  There are hardly any children at this one, and the majority of the clientele is my age.  The machines work better here, the selection is better, you don't have to walk upstairs to go play, and you don't get ripped off.  Yay for Tempe D&B!

I'm amazed I haven't written a review of this place but I am saddened that Danielle will be closing her shop at the end of this month.  Sweet Pea was definitely a pleasure to have in Downtown Phoenix.  The interior of the shop is very cute with local art on the walls and an open feel.  A small display case holds all the yummy baked goods while a refrigerator contains specialty grown up sodas.  The husband and I each sampled a cupcake and some of the PB&J sandwich cookies.  You can tell Danielle uses high quality ingredients.  The cupcakes aren't sweet enough for me, as I have the palate of a 4 year old, but they were quality confections.  The cookies however were really great.  The cookies melted in your mouth with a hint of sweet jam peeking through.  If you get a chance to head over before they close, do so as soon as possible.  Luckily we will be keeping the talented baker in the Phoenix area and we can visit Lola Coffee when it opens and sample more Sweet Pea creations.

You know, sometimes I am flat out amazed at how many really great pizza places we have in the valley.  After a summer in Olympia where I ate the worst pizza ever on multiple occasions (sorry Oly!) I've learned how truly important it is to have crappy water to make fantastic pizza!  When thinking of the perfect pizza, I always imagine a substantial crust, light pizza sauce, slightly heavy on the cheese, and generous toppings.  Valley Pizza gave me all of that!  The husband and I were craving pizza one night and we really wanted to try something new.  Of course we did some yelping and came across this place.  After a couple minutes of deep thought, I realized that this is the ghetto looking place that we have driven by maybe a billion times!  We called in our order, I got a pepperoni and then asked "what on earth is cactus bread?"  The pizza was delicious with the perfect amount of everything for my liking.  The sauce was just a wee bit spicy and I loved it!  My only gripe, and the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it was a little greasy for me.  I had to do the napkin mop up thing before I tackled my dinner.  Sooo... the cactus bread.  WOW!  Just imagine this: fried bits of pizza dough covered in a delicious glaze, then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar AND drizzled with honey.  For a little extra decadence, you get a side of whipped cream.  Oh yes.  Valley Pizza is great and serves up a hefty dose of originality which is certainly something to be admired in the world of pizza pies.  I would definitely love to order from here again when the hankering for pizza pops up again.

Based on the fact that very little on the menu was appealing to me, I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I am a nice person and I figure others are less picky than I am, they get 4.  The husband took the day off of work but since I was stuck slaving away, he picked me up to take me to lunch.  Bomberos is right by where I work, so we figured it would be a good bet.  The place is really cute inside with a nice view of the street.  Our server came by after a few minutes but he was a little stand-offish and didn't really have any recommendations.  A little disappointing in my opinion.  The menu is short, so it didn't take long for me to decide on the Salami and Manchego Panini.  My sandwich was sinfully delicious.  Pesto, manchego, and salami were sandwiched between two huge pieces of bread and grilled to crisp perfection.  It was served with a side of potato chips and a couple tiny but very yummy pickles.  The panino was overwhelming, and I couldn't even finish it.  I was surprised.  The pesto was really good, but I was tasting it for the rest of the day.  I would order this again, but maybe because it was the only thing that sounded good to me on the menu.  Again, I am annoyingly picky.  My main gripe about this place is how slow everything is.  Our server was really slow and didn't pay attention to a whole lot of anything besides himself.  We saw our panini up in the window for about 5 minutes before someone else saw it and brought it out.  I was also a bit irritated because a quick sit-down lunch for two turned out to be 45 minutes long instead of the typical 30 minutes.  Anyway, not a big deal.    I would recommend this place to others.  It seems to be a nice place to hang out and eat some good food with a nice glass of wine.  I know nothing about wine so I couldn't comment on their selection.  During our nicer weather months, the patio seems like an awesome place to hang out and relax.

I am a PICKY eater.  I don't like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, or mustard on my burgers.  That's kind of standard fare.  Whenever I go to a restaurant and order a burger, I hang my head in shame as I politely request no veggies, just the ketchup or mayo.  This makes for a usually boring and unimaginative burger.  Imagine my delight when I find out that Cheeburger actually wants ME to pick whatever I WANT to top my burger!  They won't look at me funny when I ask for things like black olives on my burger.  They don't question my desire to top my burger with a pineapple and have it covered in ranch dressing.  This is a place for people like me.  It's nice to not be questioned or judged based on your burger preferences.  As far as the quality of food goes, I have never been dissatisfied here.  They always cook it exactly the way I like it or really close to it.  The meat is always fresh tasting and juicy.  The ingredients they top it with are also fresh and plentiful, no one likes a cheapskate.  The fries here are pretty good, and the seasoning they have is not as good as say, Red Robin's, but it is it's own unique salt/pepper/garlic blend that my tastebuds enjoy.  I have had the onion rings before and they are pretty decent, just a little thick for my taste.  The soda options here are fun, and again they never question when you want a kiwi diet coke.    The decor in here is ugly as sin, but you can sit outside like we usually do and avoid the ugly decor.  If you are in the mood to be creative and surprise your palate, this is the place for you.  If you hate to be judged on your pickiness of food, then you will be right at home here.  Also, the added bonus is that it is a FANTASTIC place for people watching.

It's really fun when you sit down to write a review and, without hesitation, you click on that 5th star with a smile on your face.  That's exactly the way I felt just now.  Last Friday after work, we decided to try somewhere new for dinner and since it was pretty much on the way home, we decided on Town Talk.  Besides, BBQ sounded really good at the time.  The place is exactly like every reviewer describes it.  It's a whole in the wall, but sparkling clean.  It's fairly nondescript inside but there are plenty of articles with mentions of the restaurant all along the walls.  The owner, I'm assuming, has got to be the nicest guy around.  He was on the phone when we came in and apologized profusely afterwards for not speaking to us immediately.  Gotta love that kind of hospitality.  It didn't take long for me to decided what to eat, and I ordered the brisket entree with mardi gras potato salad and the cole slaw.  We also decided on a blackberry cobbler to go.  I wasn't really sure what to expect with Creole BBQ, but what I got was an intensely deep smoky flavor profile that just had a ridiculous amount of body.  I usually tend to go for sweet sauces, and this wasn't sweet at all, but I absolutely loved it!  The brisket was sliced very very thin, which I love, and it was still very tender.  The potato salad was really yummy and surprisingly light considering the description stating that it was a mayo potato salad.  My favorite part, the cole slaw!  Usually cole slaw is a big fat fail for everywhere bot Bobby Q and KFC.  Town Talk has got the cole slaw down pat.  It was deliciously crisp and tangy with a really good bite afterwards.  When we ate the cobbler at home it was delicious!  I really loved this place and I will definitely be back again.  It's just really special when you can go somewhere and have great food and great service in a really comfortable environment.

Lucky Boy is a solid little burger shop.  I thought the actual restaurant itself was really cute and I liked the old school feeling of it.  Their menu is straightforward and nothing fancy, and that makes me happy.  I got a Bacon Cheeseburger with Ranch a side of fries and a soda.  I think all of that cost maybe 5 bucks, so it's definitely budget conscious.  The burger was good and yummy, pretty much exactly the way I expected it to be.  The fries were also pretty good.  They were crisp on the outside, but fluffy on the inside.  I should have gotten some ranch to dip them in, because that would have been amazing.  Overall, I really liked this place, and if I'm in that part of town when I am craving a burger, i wouldn't mind stopping in again.

1130 is so lackluster it's almost painful, and what's with the name?  Is it supposed to be a time or location?  I don't know, but I'm done guessing.  I've been here twice and I don't even remember what I ordered, not even remotely.  I usually remember what I order when I eat at a good restaurant.  This is not the case.  After perusing their menu online in hopes of sparking my memory, I was able to determine what I ate here.  The first time I had the Asian Chicken Salad.  The second time, well, I can't figure it out.  The salad was boring.  Even Wendy's has a better Asian Salad than this, and it tastes fresher.  My lettuce was definitely on the wilted side and had lost most of the crispness and flavor that usually comes along with fresh lettuce.  The chicken itself was very dry and very bland.  Dry chicken can really kill a salad.  I do have to point out that the dressing it came with was very nice and appropriate in flavor.  Unfortunately, dressing alone cannot save a salad.  I was totally ready to like this place.  It's close by my house and great for people watching on the outdoor patio.  Alas, I could never love a place that can't even cook a proper chicken breast.  Even I can cook chicken as long as I have Mr. Foreman by my side.  Skip this place, you're not missing out.

After Amber, a manager/owner I am assuming, sent me a couple dining certificates to 1130, I decided to come back during earth hour since they have such a great patio.  What a turnaround I experienced this time.  We were seated immediately but we waited a good 5-10 minutes before someone came over to us.  Our server, J, came over and sincerely apologized.  He took our drink order and immediately came back with our sodas.  We had decided what to eat and I ordered the Sirloin in Cancun style (spice rubbed with a creamy wine sauce with peppers, corn, and shrimp) and the husband ordered a burger.  J recommended a particular burger that was only on the lunch menu, stating it was way better, and hooked the husband up with that one instead.  My steak was very good, although slightly undercooked in the very middle only.  It only makes sense because it was so thick and everywhere else was perfect.  The asparagus that came with it was very well grilled and seasoned and was a perfect accompaniment to the slab of meat.  During our meal, J kept our sodas constantly full.  When we finished he offered us dessert and we politely declined.  We usually never order desserts at restaurants because too often they aren't prepared in house.  This was not good enough for J, and he wasn't taking no for an answer.  After a little prodding, a wink, and an "I'm feeling extra nice today" he hooked us up with a free cheesecake, which we were delighted to learn was made in house.  We devoured that, it was very good.  He came back and asked us about it and the husband mentioned the crust being a little dry.  I told him some more butter will solve that and he said he would pass it on to the kitchen.  Experience means a lot to me when it comes to rating a restaurant.  If I have a great server, it will improve my feelings for a restaurant.  J was absolutely amazing.  He was friendly, attentive, and really nice to chat with.  What a wonderful evening we had dining by candlelight on the patio.  Even though I had 20 dollars off my meal thanks to the concern of the management I would give 1130 the 4 stars had I paid for my whole meal.  I will probably be back again, but I will definitely request J, and you should too.

First things first, I did not get a cheesesteak.  In all honesty, I have no idea what possessed me and caused me to order what I did.  The BBQ Chicken Cheesesteak is a beastly concoction.  You get fresh bread slathered with wiz, loaded with barbecued chicken, and then topped with coleslaw.  Of course I added bacon too.  When we got our food I kind of stared at it for a while.  I wasn't sure what to do with it.  How was I supposed to pick it up?  That would just be lame.  Ready with an arsenal of wet naps in my purse, I dug in to the most precarious food eating situation I have ever found myself in.  The first bite left me drooling wiz.  The second bite had coleslaw covering my hands.  The third bite had chicken falling out.  You get the idea?  It was messy and it was wrong.  It was so wrong it was right.  I really dug this weird combination.  The bacon just really pushed the sandwich from great to stellar.  I have to mention that their barbecue sauce is really good!  It's barely sweet, really smokey, and it packs a lot of flavor.  The bottom line is that I really liked this place.  I would like to go back and just try a regular cheesesteak with some fries.  Why fries too?  Because they have FRY SAUCE!  Woot!

I am a huge MAC fan.  Their products are high quality and well priced.  I use their refillable pallets for my eyeshadows and you can only purchase the refills at their freestanding stores.  As far as I know, there are only two, one in Scottsdale Fashion Square, yuck, and one in Biltmore.  Biltmore is much closer and much nicer.  This is definitely the better of the two stores.  The girls in here are great.  They are all genuinely nice, they have nice made-up faces and not the tranny business that is going on at Scottsdale.  Best of all, they are helpful without being pushy.  When I came in and asked for some help picking some neutral contour colors, the girl stared at my eyes for a bit (a little creepy) but then instantly found some fantastic colors for me.  I love coming to this store, it's always a wonderful experience.

Breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day, unless you count dessert.  My husband and I met my family out here one day after having a good and yummy experience at another location.  The service here is always good, the kids here usually know how to work a breakfast crowd.  You come quick, get drinks, take order, bring food, ask about food, take food, leave check... you know.  I don't like them chatty in the morning.  I've never been disappointed in terms of service at these places.    The food is always good.  It's simple breakfast food done in a traditional manner.  Nothing is too complicated or too foreign sounding.  They have a few creative combinations for omelets for the people that like that kind of stuff.  I particularly like that they have a combo plate that includes like 10 slices of bacon.  Maybe not that many, but it's a lot.   If you are looking for good breakfast food with good service that wears suspenders, give Black Bear a try.  Just a warning though, I have seen the places get pretty crowded.

Bleh.  I'm sorry Breadfruit, but I will not be back.  I was really excited to try this place when we heard it was opening.  I've said before that I don't like Mexican spicy but I do like Asian spicy.  I forgot to add that I also like Caribbean spicy.  Finally, a place in downtown to get some good Caribbean/Jamaican food.  Boy was I wrong.  We met a couple friends here and when we walked in, I loved the decor.  It looks just like the inside of my house with the bright colored walls and the exposed brick and ductwork.  Unfortunately, my love for this place stops there.  We decided to order the Plaintain Avocado Spring rolls.  Taste wise, these were okay on the first bite, the more you ate, the less distinguishable the flavors got.  It was really just a big mess of mush inside a soggy wonton type wrapper.  The dipping sauce was tasty though.  I ordered the Jerk Shrimp and it came with a side of rice and beans.  The tails were removed from the shrimp, which was really nice to not have to take care of myself.  Unfortunately the shrimp were not cooked very well.  They were quite tough and had this weird crispiness to them.  The flavor on the shrimp was ridiculously overpowering.  I know I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to heat and spice, but this was too much.  I couldn't taste anything besides the spice, even after downing my entire bottle of pineapple soda, which was way too sugary.  Everyone else's food looked decent, but overcooked.  One dish, the stew, looked like baby diarrhea.  Honestly.  The highlight of the meal was the little breadstick thing they serve alongside the food.  It was pretty good.  Sorry Breadfruit, I will continue to pass by you in favor of better restaurants like the Turf.

I've come to learn that NY Style pizza is not really my favorite.  However, I have also come to learn that it can be really really good too!  We have a rather large recycle bin outside our building that I constantly see Mamma Mia pizza boxes in.  I always wondered if it was good enough to eat as often as I saw boxes.  We decided to find out over the weekend while playing games with Ashley A.  She wanted pepperoni, and I didn't know what I wanted.  We got there, and I decided on a white pizza... MMMMmmm.  Our order had to have taken less than 15 minutes, which was awesome, and the people working there were totally awesome and very friendly.  We got the pizzas home and dug right in.  The white pizza was delicious with tons of garlicky ricotta and loads of mozzarella cheese.  The crust was fine, but nothing really special.  I tried a pepperoni off of the other pizza and it was pretty yummy, I should have saved some room!  We'll probably order from here again.

I have to agree with everyone else.  There is something seriously wrong with this location.  Maybe it's because they are stuck inhaling the remnants of burnt coffee next door at Starbucks, but they just suck!  They always seem to be out of the bagels we want.  When they actually do have the one I want, like last time, it was burnt on the bottom!  Yuck!  To make things worse, they are really cheap with the cream cheese or any other thing you choose to add to your bagel.  Sometimes, they get really lazy and just put it on the side and make you do all the work!  I really really really hate this location and we only go here as a last resort.  FAIL!

I'm really disappointed that I have to write such a poor review for this place.  I'm not a big fan of fish, but I love it when it's all fried up and served with fries, so I wasn't worried about coming here.  When we walked in, I was a little confused at the setup, but it kind of grew on me.  It was very clearly a mom and pop style place, and I can definitely appreciate that.  The decor was pretty awful, but endearing at the same time.  I'm not sure why they were trying to cover up their wood tabletops with awful cheap tablecloths, but to each their own.  I also liked their impressive selection of British foodstuffs.  I wasn't too hungry, so I ordered the smaller portion of the cod and chips.  I really liked that they gave you the option to order a little less.  Maybe I was under the wrong impression that this should be a faster service restaurant because you order at a counter and pay at the counter, but our food took forever to get out to us.  The unfortunate things was seeing the cook put our fries onto our plate well before the fish made it.  That left us with lukewarm fries.  The fries, well, they sucked.  They weren't the crispy kind and they weren't salted at all.  The fish, I hate to say it, was disgusting.  It was over-battered and wasn't cooked long enough.  That left me with a nasty mess of mush all over my fish.  I had to scrape it all of to be edible.  Since this place calls themselves the Codfather, and I wasn't pleased with what is supposedly their specialty, I certainly don't see myself coming back.

I almost give this place 3 stars, but as far as my experience goes, it's not there yet, and I would honestly rather have IHOP or Denny's.  Saturday morning at 9:30ish seems to be prime time for breakfast, and Over Easy proved that with the gaggle of people hanging out outside.  Since I was starving we quickly found another place via Yelp Mobile, and we ended up here.   The patio is cute with tons of shade provided by the greenery.  The inside however is awfully tacky and very poorly put together.  I was embarrassed for the owners just looking at it.  We were told to sit anywhere and we found ourselves at a little two top against the wall.  Service was prompt and we were quickly given our GIANT cups of soda, always a plus for me.  I ordered a dish that had hash browns, 3 eggs any way, bacon, and I subbed biscuits and gravy for the bread.  The amount of food on my plate was massive.  The hash browns took up a whole third of the plate real estate, but that was unfortunate as they were rather tasteless.  They were lacking in the salt/grease/butter department.  Next up, my eggs were overcooked in the yolk part but somehow not cooked enough in the whites.  It was weird, but still edible and not the way I like them.  The bacon... well there was a lot of it.  I thought that was a wonderful thing until I bit into overly fatty bacon that was cooked for way too long.  It was just really salty and crunchy.  For the first time ever, I did not eat all of the bacon in front of me.  The biscuits and gravy was by far the worst part of my meal.  The biscuits were very hard, dry, and flavorless.  It was as if they had been sitting out for at least a few days.  The gravy was pretty bad.  It was completely over-peppered and was super thick and congealed.  It wobbled instead of dripped.  Kind of gross.  When I smothered it on top of the hash browns it was a little bit better.  The husband enjoyed his dish much more than I did mine.  Maybe we will go back some time, but I know what to avoid and how to specify my bacon to be cooked.  For now, it's just a meh.

Let me start by saying that I LOVE Cold Stone.  Then why the one star?  Well, every single time I visit the location in the Arizona Center I want to kill myself, but not before strangling the inept people behind the counter.  The main problem is that this place hires high school kids who don't give two shits about working, even though they get paid to do that.  To top it off, I am pretty sure I have never seen a manager in there, and I would hate to think they would allow a 16 year old to be a manager.  The line here is almost always ridiculously long, making the small space even more unbearable.  My worst experience was when a bunch of high school kids came after a basketball game and starting screaming to their friends working.  It was a nightmare.  Like junior high all over again.  Avoid this location at all costs.  The others are all superior.  Believe me.

It appears that this Cold Stone has finally hired competent staff.  This time we were greeted by a friendly face and immediately helped.  The girl behind the counter was quick and efficient.  For once we were able to get in and out of this location in less than 20 minutes.  I'm glad to see that I can go here and not have a painful experience anymore.

I was so disappointed with my food here.  We decided to meet a couple friends here that were up in PHX for the weekend.  We wanted something really cheap and yummy, and it seemed like this place fit the bill perfectly.  Parking was a little difficult, but it was expected, so no biggie.  The place is tiny inside so there wasn't much elbow room, but we were lucky enough to grab four stools at the counter.  I ordered the Magic Mushroom Burger Deal so I got a burger, fries, and a can of soda for 5 bucks.  It really is an unbeatable deal.  Unfortunately, when the food came out, I was way less than impressed.  My fries were unsalted and very bland.  They were shoestring style, which I really like, but some were cold and some were lukewarm, obviously a less than favorable fry eating experience.  The burger was such a big let down for me.  I read on the menu that all burgers were cooked to medium, but instead I had a super thick dried out patty on the bun.  Yuck!  I would have been perfectly fine with it being well done if it were still juicy, but it lost all of its tenderness and flavor.  The cheese on the burger was gross and congealed.  The mushrooms weren't half bad but lacking salt just like the fries.    I think I was mostly disappointed because after reading all the reviews of this place, I was expecting some really good greasy and salty food.  Sadly, that was not the case at all.  Instead I only ate half my food and then did not feel very good later.  At least the place was visually entertaining on the inside.

Anyone who doesn't love this place has got to be a little bit crazy in the head!  I absolutely love the Mongolian BBQ/Stir Fry type places, so this was right up my alley.  The first thing you will notice when you come here is that it's not YC's.  The slices of meat are thicker.  The veggies are fresher and more plentiful.  The restaurant is actually bright and very clean.  Most of all, you will probably notice a lack of a chalkboard with a gazillion hand written recipes telling you how to make a sauce.  Instead, you will find the totally sweet owner standing behind the counter asking you what flavors you're looking for.  Then he'll suggest the amounts of each "sauce" you should add to get what you want.  They take their time here to cook your food, not just fling it around and make a mess.  They even place it in a nicer serving dish than just a bowl.  Nice touch.  Aside from the fantastic food, that literally bursts with fresh flavor, THIS PLACE HAS CHINESE DONUTS!!!!!! Woot!  I was so excited!  I was really disappointed however to notice that they were all out by the time I went to get some.  However, when the owner stopped by and asked how everything was, I mentioned my sadness and he quickly threw together a batch and brought me a napkin full of them to take home.  How sweet is that?!  I absolutely love this place and I look for any and every excuse to come here.

I just love BBQ.  There aren't a whole lot of places that do BBQ either, strangely enough.  We've driven by the tiny purple building a handful of times, but we've never stopped in.  A few weeks ago, we did.  I surveyed the tantalizing chalkboard menu only to be disturbed by the husband who told me cash only.  UGH!  Better luck next time.  We came by again this weekend with cash in hand, we were prepared.  There's so much on the menu that looks good to me, but I know my stomach is only so big.  I narrowed it down to a 1/2 pound of brisket, a medium cole slaw, and a medium mac and cheese.  The brisket was quite delicious and juicy, but I wished it had more BBQ sauce.  The sauce is delicious!  I will just ask for extra next time.  The cole slaw was nice.  The veggies were sliced really thin, the dressing was light with a little bit of tang and a little bit of pepper.  The mac and cheese was pretty yummy.  It was really thick and creamy and the noodles weren't overcooked.  There is so much more that I would love to try here, so I will definitely be back.  What they say is true, they do have the best smelling parking lot!

SWEEEEET!  Don't you just love it when you have had a place bookmarked for so long that you almost forgot about it, and when you finally go it's amazing?  Yeah, that's what happened here.  We had been doing a little shopping out in this part of town and were starting to get hungry so we started searching for places to go.  The husband mentioned this place and I was quite enthusiastic and mentioned I have had it bookmarked for so long.    We made our way over to the cute little store with it's big glass front and cool brick interior.  There's lots of cool music oriented art around and the tables are covered in graffiti.  Again, it's a pretty sweet place, aside from the lack of air circulation.  We stared at the gigantic chalkboard menu for a while (despite being chalkboard it's pretty easy to read) and finally made our selections.  I got the stromboli and the husband went with the meatball calzone.  The guy making our stuff was really cool and helpful.  The best part was that he really seemed to love his job.  You gotta love that.  When our food came out, the smell was intoxicating.  I dug right in and relished in the delicious garlicky dough and the sweet yet tangy sauce.  The ham was perfect and sweet and the pepperoni were meaty and spicy.  I tell ya, this stromboli was glorious.  It was glorious and HUGE!  I had to take half of it home, and yes, the leftovers were just as good.  I have a feeling that anytime I find myself in this neighborhood I am going to start salivating for the delicious goods here.  You should go.  You should also tell all your friends to go.  A place like this is too good to keep secret.

My husband and I have been big fans of this place for a while now.  Unfortunately, with their move to the bigger and "better" Scottsdale, we probably won't be visiting again.  We always made time to stop by here if we were ever in the IKEA area.  Their furniture is all wonderfully modern yet very classic.  I can see their stuff not getting dated very easily.  I love that you have the ability to personalize any upholstered piece of furniture and make it your own.  The back corner where they kept their clearance stuff was always fun, and there is always something good to be had back there.  The last time we bought a beautiful blue duvet cover for like 15 bucks.  We stopped by here on the last day of their big moving sale and we bought a wonderful rug from here for less than 200 bucks.  Too bad we won't be seeing EQ3 anymore.  Good luck in Scottsdale.

I adore La Piccola Cucina.  I love it on so many levels.  The food is fantastic, the location is great, the owners are awesome people, and they have some great imported items.  When we first came here I was a little weirded out by the way everything was displayed, already cooked.  The owner kindly explained everything to us in his big booming voice.  Once I got the idea, I promptly ordered myself meatloaf along with the potatoes and orzo.  YUMM!  The meatloaf was incredible.  Hands down, it is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  Even the husband like it, and he doesn't like meatloaf.  The potatoes were well seasoned and quite tasty.  I'm not really sure what orzo is supposed to taste like, but it sure was good.  I got a pomegranate soda to go along with my meal and it was delicious imported stuff.  After a bit of eating the owner came by and sat down to chat with us.  Usually I hate when managers/owners come by and bug me for extended periods of time.  In this case, I loved it.  The guy feels like family, like my great uncle or something.  He's so incredibly passionate about food that it amazes me.  One time we were there he was talking about this amazing vinegar that he had imported and he was so excited about it that he cracked open a new bottle just to have us smell it.  I love that guy.  Hopefully you will be lucky enough to happen upon him singing opera sometime.  I'm so glad to have La Piccola close by.  It truly is a wonderful place and a wonderful experience.  I feel bad for the girls who came here and didn't have such a good time, I really hope that it was just an off day for them.

I really wanted to like this place.  I consider myself somewhat of a cupcake connoisseur.  Every time I visit a new place that has a cupcake bakery, I try my best to visit it and try a few.  I'm also a home baker, and I make a mean cupcake.  To put it plainly, I know what cupcakes should taste like.  Unfortunately, they should not taste like the stuff that Cake Cafe puts out.  We stopped by one day after seeing a sign on a sidewalk with balloons attached.  After debating for about two seconds over getting cupcakes, we pulled into the parking lot.  Walking in was not a pleasant experience.  The decor reminds me of a twelve year old pre-pubescent girl.  Not a good thing.  There are way too many non-cupcake related cheap gifts cluttering the right side of the decent sized bakery.    I ordered a peanut butter chocolate cupcake, my usual, and the husband ordered a chocolate mint cupcake.  My chocolate cake was dry and tasted off.  Other reviewers suggest that this is because they used cake mix, and I have to agree. That's probably it. The frosting however, I liked because it was super sweet and peanut buttery. The grainy texture was a little irritating, but the flavor was still good. Opponents of super sweet will not enjoy these. The husband also had a chocolate cake and the accompanying "off" taste. He also wasn't sure if the mint was in the cake as well as in the frosting. He enjoyed the frosting but remembered the far superior cupcakes we had enjoyed at Yummy Cupcakes in California previously.  I may go back here.  It's hard to resist a cupcake when you don't have to make it yourself.  Maybe they were having a bad day when I went.  I am willing to give them a second try.  Cake Cafe, please don't let me down.

I'm a big fan of this place, but I'm not a big fan of their 10 dollar cover charge.  I guess I can look at it as paying for the entertainment because I never get close enough to the stage to tip.  Although, I have noticed that there is not always a cover, and sometimes it is cheaper, but I can't remember when all of that crap happens.  Basically, you've got a big split level room (extremely dangerous stairs for drunks) with a really long bar on one side, a tiny bar on another, and a slightly raised stage up in the front.  The place is always packed, and you've got to fight for seats sometimes.  I hear they serve food, but I never get it.  I would hate to have to depend on a waitress.  Tip: just go to the bar to order drinks, don't waste your time with a server unless it is early on in the evening.  The music is a lot of fun.  They take lots of requests and put a piano spin on all of our favorite current songs.  For birthday people they embarrass the hell out of them, and if the person is female, crazy raunchiness WILL ensue.  They tell lots of dirty jokes, sing filthy songs, and swear a lot.  This place is definitely not for the easily offended or the prudish.  I love it all, and it cracks me up.  My favorite part is when the staff gets up on the bar and on stage, and sometimes on the pianos and starts doing some weird choreographed dance.  It's a lot of fun, and sometimes the hot guys take off the shirts and the girls engage in pseudo-lesbian action.  A little something for everyone.  Bottom line, it's a lot of fun and everyone should go at least once.

Maizie's is along the light rail, and that's great for us since we live in such close proximity to a stop.  We decided to stop by late one night after hearing a lot of good things about the place.  It's a really cute and small place.  Very cozy and inviting.  We were sat at the hightop, which essentially turned it into a communal table as another couple was already sitting there.  I am a big fan of communal seating, it's such a fun concept that Phoenix should embrace more.  I got the Roasted Vegetable and Shrimp Pesto.  The pasta was very nicely cooked and the sauce was really tasty but extremely runny.  I kept flinging sauce everywhere.  The veggies were obviously seasonal, but I picked through most of them, sticking with the asparagus and yummy mushrooms.  The shrimp were also very good, being plump and wonderfully cooked.  The bread that came with it was excellent for sopping up the extra sauce.  The husband got the inside out Pizza Burger.  He wasn't too pleased with it, but thought that a better way of putting the ingredients together would make it taste great.  After dinner we decided to order their half baked cookie.  The husband and i both have a weakness for these.  About 2 minutes after we ordered it, the cookie was delivered to our table... burnt.  We tried to eat it, but it was too much.  The owner came by along with our waiter and they very quickly remedied the situation, no questions asked.  Our service was pretty good considering our poor waiter had busted up his knee earlier, but my refills of soda were plentiful.  He also immediately fixed our issue with dessert which is also a big plus with me.  Very chatty guy.  As a side note, we visited Maizie's again on their 3 dollar burger day.  You get a 3 dollar burger.  It was overdone even though I ordered it medium.  I will stick with a big, fat, juicy whopper for 3 bucks instead.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  I really enjoyed Maizie's.  It is a fantastic place to hang out for a while and eat some good food.  I definitely recommend bringing people here.  It's got a great personality in an otherwise boring culinary city.

I've driven by here a few times and never even noticed it was there.  The place is tiny and situated at the end of a fairly ghetto looking strip mall.  It's so tiny that I even asked my husband as we were pulling in if they only did take-out like pizza hut.  Thankfully, this was not the case.  We sat ourselves inside the very small restaurant and watched the pizza maker guys for a few minutes before the server came around to us.  I have to say, this guy is very lucky that he is Italian and ridiculously adorable, otherwise he would have been pissing me off.  He was really absent minded and liked to talk on his cell phone.  To make up for it though, he was quite charming and made jokes with the patrons.  I admit I felt foolish when I saw a huge pizza being made and asked what it was, but his cute accent and description made it all better.  The food we had was calamari fritti and a regular sized meatball pizza.  The calamari was not so good.  I will warn anyone that orders it that it is a mixture of the typical rings and then the miniature squid bodies.  Those make me sick, and I can't eat them.  The rings were just too rubbery for me and the batter was way too light.  The marinara sauce that came with it was delicious though, and I do not like marinara sauce by itself.  The pizza was a little different than I expected.  The meatballs were once large and were sliced down to go on the pizza.  I was just expecting baby meatballs, so this was still okay.  The fresh mozzarella combined with the delicious marinara sauce and the very flavorful meatballs made for a wonderful pizza experience.  The husband even ate the crust first.  He NEVER eats crust.  It was really good crust.  I probably won't be back to dine in here, but I will certainly be ordering to-go from them.  Maybe I will place an order and then run across the street to occupy myself in the Ocean Floor and stare at the big fishies.  Bottom line, excellent pizza, fair prices, and it's better than Bianco's.

I really like this, um, area.  It's got a really cool collection of stores ranging from the ones everyone has heard of to the ones that everyone hasn't.  They have the best Apple store around, where the associates are not a bunch of pricks.  The food selection is decent, and it seems to be growing.  They have the husband's favorite yogurt place, Yogurberry, so that's a plus.  I also think the Famous Dave's should be open now, yum!  I like the design of this area, it's quite expansive but still walkable.  I agree with Melinda S., and I think she was spot on when she said this place is kind of like Disneyland in its setup.  Anyway, I don't know how well this place will fare in the scorching summer, but only time will tell.  I can't imagine that their incredibly dark color scheme, that I happen to like, is going to be of any help.

I'm really quite surprised I have never reviewed this place.  In an effort to try and keep our Christmas shopping as local as possible this year, we decided to check out Practical Art and see what they had.  They have quite an impressive array of "practical art" ranging from rustic pottery, fallen mesquite French Rolling Pins, glass handled silverware, knitted items, glass items, and everything in between.  I fondled the rolling pins for a time that could be deemed inappropriate but they are beautiful.  No trees were harmed in the process of making those beautiful babies.  They also had a cute Christmas display of glass and metal ornaments at the checkout counter and we couldn't help but buy a beautiful orange glass snowflake.  This is a really great store where you could probably find a unique and beautiful gift for that hard to buy for person on your list.

I don't know how this is possible, but I had no idea this place even existed, and we drive down Camelback all the time!  We stopped by today because there was a bit of a fundraiser/ice cream social going on for Arizona Rescue and I can't resist an opportunity to indulge my Monstah and to support a good cause.  Plus, the dog needed some food and I was hoping they carried it.  Thankfully they do carry the wellness line of dog food so I was happy.  The staff was all friendly and not at all salesman-like.  The prices are fair and they have a small but comprehensive selection of toys.  I quite liked this store and I think I will go in again on a less busy day to check it out a little more.  The Monstah gives it 4 paws up.

Typically the husband and I don't care for Harkins Theatres for a myriad of reasons, but this one seemed to be a step above all the other locations.  First of all, they seemed to be well staffed, and their employees actually did their jobs well.  I can't tell you how many times we have gone to see a 3D movie and haven't been given our glasses.  Second, the lobby is small, but designed well enough to hold a lot of people and keep the lines out of your way.  The theatres were clean, the bathrooms were clean and the picture/sound quality was great.

I can't honestly believe that I am giving a buffet 4 stars, but I can't help it.  The husband and I decided to try something new after a failed attempt at Stacy's Smokehouse (they only take cash).  A quick turnaround and a short drive later, we arrived at Sabor Cubano.  I already knew I liked the place when the first thing I saw upon walking in was a giant fish tank.  I'm a sucker for fishies.  The girl who greeted us was super sweet and her accent was absolutely adorable.  Now, I'm no expert on authentic Cuban food, but I did try a really good Cuban place in Miami and this was right along the lines of that place.  The buffet is small but comprehensive.  There are a couple different types of beans, a few offerings of rice, a soup, and many meat dishes.  Oh, before I forget, there are these amazing little fried wonders called croquettes (I think) and they were insanely good.  I have no idea what they are or what was in them, but I ate like 6 of them.  The beans were very tasty but the rice had been out too long (the place was empty when we got there).  The meat dishes however were really great.  The meat was all very tender and juicy.  I'm not really sure how Cuban food is prepared, but from what I discovered here, everything is slow roasted and delicious and full of deep, full bodied flavor.  The yucca is also really really good and something I had never tried before, kind of like tastier mashed potatoes.  To end our meal, I decided to put off my previous conceptions about flan and ordered what is considered The New Times best Flan in 2008.  It was good.  I was a little off put by the weird texture, but the sweetness kept pulling me in.  There is also a small salad and dessert buffet.  The dessert is nothing spectacular, rice pudding that I did not like, simple chocolate pudding, and blueberry muffins (???),  I hope this place is doing well.  It's nice to have a different buffet option other than the million Chinese buffets and the generic Hometown/Old Country Buffet.  It's also right off the 19th and Camelback lightrail stop so there is no excuse to not try it.

From the outside, this place always looked so cheesy, especially whenever they were displaying their giant banners that advertised some deal they had going on.  Just a wee bit tacky in my opinion.  Inside is not really much different.  There are peanut shells on the floor and a nice little bucket of peanuts on the table for you people who cannot wait the extra two minutes for the yummy free bread to come out.  As far as the food goes, it's pretty standard, but solid.  Everything was prepared well and seemed fresh.  I ordered the meatloaf, not really sure why, but it was pretty good, but a little heavy on the onions.  Their mac and cheese was pretty basic but really cheesy and gooey which was perfect on the crazy rainy day we went there.  The service was pretty fantastic, and my drink never went empty.  Our server was a little frat boy for me, but he was friendly and made enough conversation to act like he cared, but not so much that I wanted to punch him in the face.   We'll probably go back at some point considering we find ourselves at Mesa Riverview and Tempe Marketplace rather often, but next time I am saving room for the mini bucket shot desserts.  You get to take the mini bucket home!

I don't have much to say other than I love this place and their Chicken Salad is incredible.  It's a short walk from our house, but is unfortunately always closed by the time we get home from work.  We rejoice anytime we have a day off and we make every effort to make it to Hero Factory to pick up a sandwich.    I know absolutely nothing about New York authenticity, but I can tell you that this place is damn good.  Try the chicken salad.  'Nuff said.

Like a few other reviewers, I was less than satisfied with the service here.  Our friends brought us here one weekend and told us it was one of the places they liked to go.  We went in for lunch and were presented with the lunch menus.  Unfortunately, nothing looked particularly interesting except for the mac and cheese wedge.  WTF is that?  Out of curiosity and because of my long standing relationship with mac and cheese, I ordered it.  For those of you wondering what it is, it is pretty much mac and cheese that is baked in a square dish, then cut into wedges so it is a big congealed triangle of cheesy pasta.  I give this place credit for the presentation of my food.  However it was less than average.  Between everyone's mediocre food and our terrible/rude/impatient service, we will not be going back.

Since Mother's Day is a special occasion and District was having a special event, we decided that now was as good a time as ever to try this place.  I am so glad that we did.  While I balked at how much we spent, I can't help but remember how good everything was, and that it is definitely worth it.  We brought my other mom, mother-in-law, because she has a special appreciation for all things downtown and she had been wanting to try this place as well.  This place really is beautiful.  There is a modern edge to everything, but it's styled in a way that makes you feel incredibly comfortable here.  The staff is all unbelievably nice and friendly.  We were greeted with "Happy Mother's Day" all the way outside by the valet attendants to the inside by our server.  Not one staff member walked by without saying it.  That's a nice touch.  Now the food.  WOW!  The buffet line was beautifully set up and was filled to the brim with excellent food.  I sampled, and then some, so much food that I thought I would burst.  I'm going to present this in list form because it's just easier that way. -French Toast Casserole: Sweet and tasty.  Like bread pudding in pecan roll form. -Scrambled Eggs - Light and fluffy and well seasoned. -Yogurt Parfait - Served in a martini glass with seriously good granola. -Bacon - Very good and cooked well. -Sausage - From Schreiners, very good but a tad to spicy for breakfast (at least for me) -Biscuits & Gravy - Different.  It wasn't very sausagey but I really enjoyed the taste of it.  It was not as heavy as normal B&G. -Fresh Fruit - The berries were served in shot glasses and were so perfect I couldn't believe it.   -Mac&Cheese - Definitely not my style, it was really boring to me, I would actually be upset if I ordered it. -Chocolate Mousse Cake - INCREDIBLE.  I wish I wasn't so stuffed at this point of my meal to actually enjoy it more.  The cake was super moist and dense, but the mousse inside was amazing.  I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff.  I couldn't have been more pleased with this place.  Everything was delicious and beautiful.  I felt strangely at ease here.  It seems to be a fancy place, but it wasn't pretentious like I had expected.  We had such a wonderful time, and our server Jeff was fantastic.  One thing I was so amused with was every time an employee saw a napkin unfolded, they would twist it around and make it look nice again.  Bottom line, I would love to come here again, but I will have to wait till Payday.

The husband and I decided it would be a good idea to go back and try District for something other than breakfast because they had a $3 burger deal on Twitter.  Not wanting to pass up normally expensive food at poor people prices, we went in and were seated in the completely empty dining area.  Our order was taken quickly and our drinks brought out quickly as well.  The burgers came out on cool cast iron plates and our side order of Old Bay fries came in a paper bag.  I thought the presentation was really cute and not too kitschy.  The burgers were cooked exactly to our specifications and they were delicious!  They used great, fresh meat and were easy on the handling.  The fries were delicious.  They were thin, crisp, and the seasoning was perfect!  I can't really say anything bad for a 15 dollar lunch for two at District.  As expected, the service was just as wonderful as the first time we went, with nothing going un-refilled or wanted.  Great place, I just wish I could afford to go more often.

I'm not exactly sure how to say this, but I will try anyway.  THIS WAS THE BEST FREAKIN MEAL OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!  Really, it was.  We decided to come by for Restaurant Week and I am soooooo glad we did!  The food was incredible and service, as always, was impeccable.  I ordered the shrimp po' boy sliders as an app.  DELICIOUS.  They were perfectly sweet and spicy at the same time.  I got the pork tenderloin with green beans, mac and cheese, and applesauce for my main course.  The pork was extremely tender and the bbq sauce was delectable.  The applesauce was a huge surprise.  It was super smooth and was perfect for smothering my pork.  Finally, dessert.  I got the Heaven Can Wait Chocolate Cake.  It was so moist and dense but so rich and fluffy at the same time!  It was served with a chocolate sea salt stick and that was just like nirvana in my mouth.  I also tried some of their lemon basil icee that was served with another dessert.  It was literally a rainbow of happiness in your mouth.  WOW.  That's all I can add.  This place deserves a chance.  Give them your money now!

Yeah, I know, another update, but what can I say?  Honestly, District does not have a good enough rating.  I'm not sure if people are missing the artfully crafted dishes with a subtle twist on traditional "American" food or if they just don't appreciate impeccable service and delicious locally grown foods.  Whatever, more for me!  Yesterday we read a tweet from Chef Nathan that tempted us with the debut of the Lobster Pot Pie.  Of course we were there right at 5:00, we couldn't resist.  We ordered it and were served the most beautiful and impressive pot pie I have ever seen.  Now let's get something straight, pot pies are not glamorous, and they are rarely beautiful.  This baby was a definite standout and impressive to boot.  The pie stood incredibly tall on a large white plate and the mountain of puff pastry induced some serious jaw dropping on my part.  The crust was butter and flaky and it melted in your mouth.  The inside was TO DIE FOR!!!  There were huge tender, succulent chunks of lobster.  The veggies (potatoes, carrots, peas, carmelized onions, and celery) were all deliciously crisp and imparted just the right amount of flavor to this perfect dish.  The sauce that melded everything together was just slightly thick with a hint of sweetness that paired so well with the lobster.  I can't say enough about this.  Chef Nathan came out to chat with us about the dish and was clearly excited about it.  He earnestly accepted any criticism we had, which was none, and listened to me rave on and on about how good it was.  He bought us our drinks too!  He's a great guy, and if you ever go and get a chance to chat with them, please do.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!

If you like girls all slutted up in "kilts" and tied up white shirts (really just redefined school girl outfits) then you will love this place.  An Insider's Tip: Sit at a high top and the girls boobs will be perfectly placed so you don't have to look like you're staring.  There doesn't seem to be anything particularly great about this place, but I just love people watching here.  Overall a pretty good place to hang out, it's loud, but not too loud that you can't have normal bar conversation.

I've been in here like a million times to raid the counter at Petit Fromage, but I had never actually tried any of the offerings from D'Licious Dishes.  Finally, the husband and I had way too busy of a schedule to go out to eat or to even make dinner at home so I picked up a piece of sausage lasagna and some garlic mashed potatoes here.  Once I got home and reheated my food I nestled up on the couch to eat and watch Judge Judy.  I was not prepared for how delicious my food was going to be!  The garlic mashed potatoes were beyond perfect.  They were smooth and creamy but with some chunky pieces every now and then.  The garlic flavor was perfectly balanced.  You could definitely taste it, but you weren't tasting it hours later.  The lasagna was exceptional as well.  It was also really big for a really fair price, 7 bucks I think.  The noodles were a perfect al dente, the tomato sauce was fresh and robust, the ricotta was yummy, and the sausage had a great kick to it.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!  Plus, they share space with my new obsession, so how can I go wrong?

If only every dairy farm in the world could be as wonderful, clean, and humane as the Super Farm.  As soon as we pulled up, I knew this was a different kind of dairy farm.  The grounds were exceptionally clean for a farm, and it smelled, but not in that "omg this is so offensive I need a gas mask" type of way.  We actually came here twice.  The first time was on a Monday because we were under the assumption that they were open, and they weren't.  I tweeted my disappointment and was immediately offered an apology along with a free tour.  I was really impressed with the intense desire to please everyone that they clearly have here.    We came back later in the week, but we did pay for our tour.  I don't mind supporting wonderful places like this with my hard earned dollars.  The tour lasted about an hour and consisted of a introduction to the farm along with lots of great information about their animals and the way they are taken care of.  Next we visited the "petting zoo" type animals, goats, donkey, horse, goose, rabbit, lamb.  the good stuff.  The animals were all clean and seemed very happy.  After that we got to go on a hayride around the facilities where we learned what each enclosure was for.  After the tour we stopped in their cute little boutique that is filled with all sorts of great things from novelties, to clothing, to yummy sodas and homemade dairy products.  I was also very impressed with how well our tour guide handled the hordes of children and their pushy parents.  I was Super Impressed with Super Farm and hope that everyone gets a chance to tour sometime.

This is a pretty cool place, especially if you are a beer drinker, which I am not.  If we are at Westgate for some unknown reason, we will usually choose this place over the other offerings in the plaza.  The Happy Hour here is usually pretty decent, with a fairly large offering of appetizers for cheap and cheap martinis as well.  Always a good thing.  I've had a couple different things from the menu here and I have always been happy with my selections.  I have had the Beef Dip sandwich and it is quite tasty.  However, if you are looking for really thinly sliced beef, do not get this sandwich because they slice it rather thick.  I have also ordered their Mac and Cheese here and it was delicious.  A good standby.    If you are looking for gourmet food, don't come here because that's not what you will get.  If you are looking for traditional but yummy food then this is a good place to try.  Overall, a great place to eat, talk, and drink.  Doesn't get better than that.

What a disappointment.  Since my husband and I were out in Scottsdale for the most recent OYE, we decided to stop by a cupcake shop to indulge.  We settled on this place because of it's proximity to where we already were.  The store on the inside is cute with pale pink and black decor.  The girls working leave A LOT to be desired.  We didn't get so much as a Hi, or Welcome, or even a What can I get for you?.  It was bad.  Anyway, after a couple moments of awkward silence, the husband and I ordered a Red Velvet, a Peanut Butter, and a German Chocolate.  Sadly, there isn't much to tell you about the taste because you've probably had it all before.  There is no way these cupcakes are made from scratch.  Each and every one tasted like a Betty Crocker cupcake.  At least they were well executed boxed cupcakes.  They are also extremely wasteful when it comes to packaging.  Instead of finding one box or bag or whatever for our three cupcakes, each cupcake was individually packaged in a too large chinese takeout box with a handle.  What a shame.  At least Sprinkles uses recycled materials.  This makes me sad.  In a world where cupcake shops pop up everywhere, and a good portion of them make their goods from scratch, you have to bring competition if you are going to get my vote.  I make cupcakes from scratch and I make them quite well, so I know what tastes good.  I even give Sprinkles better marks than this place.  At 3 dollars a cupcake, I expect high quality ingredients.  I tasted none of that.  Too bad.  Go to another cupcake shop instead.

This was yet another stop on what turned into our Fall Break Tour of Phoenix Magazine's Best New Restaurants of 2009.  Unfortunately, I disagreed with Phoenix Magazine again.  It was lunchtime and we had been doing a lot of shopping, so the husband and I had worked up quite the appetite.  We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time.  We waited in line for about 5 minutes or so, I looked at the menu and decided to go basic with a bean and cheese burrito.  It sounded really good at the time.  We ordered and then sat down and waited.    And waited, and waited, and waited.  Ugh!  But wait, the husband's food came out first.  Almost an entire five minute before mine.  His meal was so small he was pretty much finished by the time I got my burrito.  My burrito was really blah.  I think it's cool that they don't cook the beans with lard, but apparently that translates into a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Same goes for the cheese.  I had no idea any was even in there.  So, I left hungry and unhappy with a nasty bean film in my mouth.  I won't be back.

Wow, I really am disappointed that it took me so long to come here.  To be fair though, I didn't want to try it until I read their breakfast menu, where practically everything looks delectable.  In any event, we have been here for breakfast a couple times and I have enjoyed it immensely both times.  On our first outing I got the blueberry quinoa johnny cakes and the mango/pineapple (or something like that) smoothie.  The johnny cakes were so good and so filling.  It was served with REAL maple syrup and complemented beautifully with a dollop of greek yogurt.  There was way too much for me to eat and it kept me energized and full for hours.  The smoothie was wonderful too, but a little pricey.  The second time I went with the 2 egg breakfast that came with turkey bacon and sweet potato hash.  The eggs were surprisingly greasy compared to all my other stuff.  They still tasted good though.  The turkey bacon was surprisingly good to me, and I don't usually go along with "substitutes" like that.  The winner of the plate was definitely the sweet potato hash.  There was some seriously awesome caramelization going on in there and the potatoes were perfectly sweet, only made better with a little bit of salt.  After my two visits have clearly shown me that healthy food does not mean bad tasting, I am much more inclined to try this place for dinner sometime.  I am also intrigued by the philosophies of the co-founder Dr. Andrew Weil and I would like to experience more of it through the culinary delights at True Food Kitchen.

Z Pizza I love you.  Screw Bianco's.  You are the best pizza joint in my book.  Every time I go, I get something fresh and delicious.  I used to always make custom calzones which were always to die for, but I mysteriously switched to pizza one day, and I haven't looked back.  After a bark at the park day I decided to try some of their pepperoni pizza that they had out and it was sooooo good.  That's all I get now.  The pepperoni is just perfectly spicy and the cheese is delicious and gooey.  Isn't that what pizza should be like?  Oh yeah, the crust.  I don't really like pizza crust unless I can cover it in ranch, but there is something about the crust here that is so good.  It's light and kind of fluffy.  It's substantial but not too thick.  Yum.  Plus, I can walk to this place from my house in like 5 minutes.  Score.  Thank you ZPizza for opening downtown, you made my dreams come true.

This store is truly incredible.  I felt like I was walking in to an Old World Hollywood dressing room.  There were soooo many different things in here, all beautifully arranged by color.  The era that the clothes came from varies greatly, so there is sure to be something to suit every vintage fashionista's needs.  My favorite items were mostly coats, some of which were refurbished and adorned by the owner herself, and others were just plain amazing.  I also had my eye on this crazy silver sparkly dress for only 13 bucks!  Unfortunately, my body would definitely protest squeezing into it.  The owner was incredibly friendly and chatty.  This is a fantastic store and I hope to come back and maybe add something to my closet!

I don't know of a single Phoenician who wasn't absolutely ecstatic about Hanny's opening.  We were all excited for this cool new "destination."  The husband and I were the second pair of people to walk through their doors.  There were literally hoards of employees working at the time.  There were about 15 upstairs staring at us, about 5 at the bar, and 15 or so more servers just chillin around the restaurant.  Somehow, with all these people, they managed to completely ignore us for most of our meal.  Making a typical 45 minute to 1 hour dinner experience turn into a 2 hour ordeal.  The decor of this place is beautiful.  Cool, clean, and modern.  The music fluctuates from being too loud and inappropriate for the setting to being perfect with an eclectic but well blended mix.   The pizza is decent, but very appetizer-ish.  It is cracker thin, which turns a lot of people off, but I actually like it.  The onion strings are to die for when they aren't completely grease laden.  That's an off and on thing, not really consistent.  I don't like their sandwiches.  They are unimaginative and bland.  There really isn't a lot to choose from on the menu.  Unfortunately both times we brought friends along with us, the place was a buzz kill, and I am not really sure why.  Maybe we will try the place again now that it has been open for a while.  Hopefully Hanny's has figured out what he wants to be when he grows up.

I feel like it's been forever since Tuck Shop opened and it's taken me all the way until now to actually go!  That has more to do with the fact that I have the eating habits of a geriatric and like to eat at 4, and places like this don't open until 5.    My first impressions were that this was a very cute little restaurant with homey touches here and there but not without it's own modern flair.  The tables and chairs are all mismatched, but thankfully at appropriate heights.  I liked the faux ceiling that gave the impression that it was lower in the middle, but I can see other people really hating that.  The staff was all friendly and knowledgeable and the guy who I am guessing is the owner had some really amusing shorts on.  The food was wonderful.  There was lots that looked good on the menu to us, and it was too difficult to narrow it down to one sharing plate, on top of the appetizer and small plate we ordered, so we went ahead and got two.  We started with the walnut crusted fontina, and that was delicious.  It was served with a sweet and earthy pear sauce as well as a roasted red pepper sauce.  They were delicious when swirled together.  Next we had the mac and cheese with the lobstah added.  I really liked the mac and cheese.  It was tender with a real down home sauce with just the right amount of cheesy flavor and warmth.  The lobster was quite unique.  It had a great woody flavor that I didn't expect but I found to be really appropriate for the dish.  Finally, I had the citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar waffle.  It was ambrosial.  The chicken was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  It was intensely crispy and the citrus brine gave it a whole new flavor profile that I was not ready for.  The white cheddar waffle was yummy, but a little too eggy for my liking.  It did however, go extremely well with the chicken,  I really enjoyed my visit here, and I hope to come back sometime soon.

Mojo Yogurt is yet another frozen yogurt offering among the many.  This one however does so with a twist, it's self-serve.  This is a good and bad thing.  For those who like to control the amount of topping you have, it's great.  For those who are indecisive or lack the ability to guesstimate the weight, this is bad.    Mojo has a wide array of flavors available.  Here is the full list: Original Tart, Green Tea, Tart Strawberry, Passionfruit, Pomegranate, Wild Strawberry, Wild Blueberry, O.J., Mango, Lemon, Banana, Chocolate, Cookie, Vanilla, Latte, Plain, Bubblegum, Pistachio, Mint, Kahlua, Root Beer, and then there are even sugar free and fat free varieties.  To be indecisive and placed in this shop would be an awful situation.  It's best to go in here with a plan.  As for toppings, they offer something a little bit different than other yogurt places.  The options here are mostly fruit or candy with a few crunchy toppings thrown in for good measure.    I really like this place because I can make my ratio of yogurt to toppings 1:1.  Woohoo.  My husband won't ever go back here because he doesn't like the system of paying by weight.  Oh well, there is always Yogurberry for him.

In case you didn't already know, I am a really picky eater so I am a really big fan of customization/build your own anything.  Indulge Burgers definitely fit that bill and made me one happy camper as I scarfed down my just for me burger.  The place is situated in an average looking strip mall in Scottsdale but the inside is just luxe enough to remind you where you are, but laid back enough to let you be yourself.  They had an arrow on the wall pointing to the bathrooms that simply said, "2P."  There are no fancy scmancy giant menus to clutter your table, simply a paper printout with little bubbles that you can fill in a la standardized testing bubble sheets.  Fun.  There is a ton of stuff to choose from, but this is what I got: 1/3 lb burger with olives, carrots, bacon, cheddar, and ranch on a wheat bun.  It was delicious.  Never had carrots on your burger?  You should try it.  I also tried the bistro dipping sauce, whatever that is, but found it to be a bit too spicy for my taste.  The burger was delicious, but too big for me to even come close to finishing.  They should consider a 1/4 pound option for the weenies like me.  I also really liked that they served me kettle chips covered in cheese before my meal.  Salty and cheese?  Yeah, that will make me happy.  This is definitely a great addition to Scottsdale where I can find refuge whenever I get lost in the sea of plastic.

I am definitely not a fan of this casino.  Yes it is nice to look at from the outside, and yes it is also quite nice to look at from the inside.  It's still fairly new so the old casino stench has yet to set  in.  In comparison to other casinos, this one seems to be entirely too small, but laid out pretty well.  I thought the selection of machines was pretty lame.  I'm a big fan of Keno and Video Poker, but there was a very limited selection of each.  I probably won't go back to this casino.

We came here because we were hungry and the name made us laugh.  When we got here, the name had apparently changed to an unclever "Wok n Grill."  I grabbed a to-go menu on our way in because I could already see the mess of distracting pictures and words all over their "menu board."  It was difficult to read and I wasn't going to waste time trying.  There are too many things on the menu and I got frustrated looking at too many options and went with the relatively boring lemon chicken.  The guy behind the counter was unhelpful and kind of frustrating.  After we ordered and sat down, we waited for about 10 minutes and got our blazing hot food served to us on styrofoam plates.  Argh.  The sauce on my lemon chicken was pretty good, albeit a little bit gelatinous.  The chicken was good in some parts, but tough and stringy in others.  Unfortunately, the thing I hate most with fried foods happened to me here.  The batter was put on too thick and was not fried long enough, making the stuff next to the chicken mushy and disgusting.  I could only eat a little of it.  Bottom line is this place kind of sucks and I won't be back.

We had originally attempted to come here a few months ago, but our friends decided it looked "too cheap, dirty, and gross."  Ugh... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and I am really glad we did!    The restaurant is located in an average looking strip mall and the interior is just as average.  That's fine by me though.  Like someone else said in their review, at least I can see where their priorities are.  I ordered the 2 meat combo with shrimp and crawfish tails.  It was served with my choice of side, and I went with the cole slaw.  I was surprised at how flavorful the cole slaw actually was.  The shrimp were big and their outsides were really crispy.  They were quite yummy.  There were tons of baby crawfish tails, battered and fried like the shrimp.  Those were also yummy and quite succulent.  I really really enjoyed my meal.  If you come here, don't make the mistake that I did and not notice the yummy seasoning on the table.  I didn't notice it until after I was full, but I sampled it, and it was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely come back here next time I am in the area.

I almost gave this place just 4 stars.  I had to think long and hard if I would want to go to this place for breakfast as equally as I would want to go to Matt's.  I do!!!  I was really excited to try this place for a regular meal after the OYE here.  Everything was so delicious then and I could only wait with bated breath to finally try the biscuits and gravy that I heard are completely homemade.  I'm always nervous about places that tell you to seat yourself because I have been overlooked so many times.  Not this time though.  Within 30 seconds of sitting down, we were greeted by a server and he took our drink order.  Already knowing that the OJ here is fresh squeezed and delicious, we ordered that.  It's a decent sized glass so I feel like the value is good.  The husband and I both ordered the same thing, biscuits and gravy.  It came with hashbrowns and 2 eggs any way you want it.  We got scrambled and I ordered a side of bacon.  I cannot resist good bacon.  The biscuits and gravy was amazing.  The gravy was smooth and delicious.  It didn't get a nasty skin or congeal-y or anything like that.  There were lots of chunks of sausage in it and the biscuits were super fluffy and tasty.  This is heaven.  A perfect amount of gravy for two perfectly sized biscuits.  The hashbrowns could use some seasoning, but the gravy mixed with them was divine.  The eggs were eggs.  I love this place.  I will certainly be back even though it is rather far from my downtown Phoenix home.  Another plus... we had a complete breakfast dining experience in 25 minutes.  Wow.  Love it.

Usually when you go to a salon and spa you get a section where hair is done and then a small section where the "spa" treatments are done.  Usually nothing special.  At XS you will notice a huge difference.  This place is huge and quite beautiful.  They have distinctly separate spa which are far from the hustle and bustle of the salon.  The salon itself is large and pretty with lots of stations and a pretty cool washing station.  Alex is the best, ask for her.  Yes, she is my friend and yes I am shamelessly plugging her but she is incredibly talented and loves what she does.  My hair looks fantastic when she is done with it.  She even gave me a tour of the entire facility, so that's how I know about the beautiful and extensive spa.  They also have a private courtyard that can be rented out for parties and etc.  If you are out in the east valley and want a high quality salon experience, you should definitely go here.  The prices are pretty decent for a high-end salon, especially considering the swanky digs.

I've had this place bookmarked for ages now and finally we were in the area so we went.  We drove around the stupid little shopping area forever just trying to find the restaurant until we discovered that the address is slightly misleading.  In case this happens to you, it is facing Dobson and a little bit south of Guadalupe.    I absolutely loved the decor of the restaurant, very minimalist, lots of black and white with a really eclectic mix of old, new, and industrial furnishings.  I really liked the church pews for the booths.  They could stand to have a better air conditioning system because the fairly open kitchen and the constant opening and closing of the ovens makes it get warm inside pretty quickly.  The food I thought was fantastic.  The menu has a TON of different pasties to choose from, so there is definitely something on the menu for everyone, even vegetarians.  I chose the meat and cheese pasty which was pork sage sausage with a couple different cheeses inside.  When it came out, it looked beautifully golden brown on the outside.  I really really liked the pastry portion.  The inside was equally as good too.  The sausage was really delicious.  It was simple but so full of flavor.  My main gripe about this place is that they don't make the pasties fresh.  I watched the guys in the kitchen pull them out of the refrigerator/freezer.  However, even though this happens, they still taste delicious and fresh.  They probably just make them the morning of, as I can imagine they are quite time consuming to prepare.  Great place!

I was pleasantly surprised by my visit to Taps.  We had arranged a small get together with some other yelpers to play some board games and the people at Taps were gracious and friendly.  I should also add that the place was empty when we got there though, so we weren't really inconveniencing them.  Anyway, they're menu looks pretty interesting, and it has a decent enough variety to keep everyone happy.  I decided to go with the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  I am so glad that I decided to get that because it was so good!  Lots of lettuce, plenty of bacon, a heart portion of cheese, along with some other good mix-ins topped with a delicious barbecue ranch dressing made this one fantastic salad!  I would definitely order it again.  I also shared the turtle cheesecake with Ashley A. and we pretty much demolished it (it was more me than Ashley.)    If I were out in Litchfield again, I would definitely consider coming here.  It has a nice laid back atmosphere and the food was great and priced well.

Hooray!  I love this place!  I've been dying to go here ever since I heard about Super Farm.  My favorite thing about this place is the fact that we get local ice cream made from milk at a local farm that is probably the most superior dairy farm on earth.  Just sayin...  Despite the fact that it was really really cold outside, I was determined to get a scoop of ice cream.  I tried the Magic Cookie Bar and it was really delicious.  It was packed full of huge chunks of Magic Cookie Bars and surrounded by lusciously creamy chocolate ice cream.  I totally loved it.  I also tried the peanut butter, wicked good, and the fudge brownie, also very good and pairs well with the pb.  I wish this was closer to home but it's close enough to my parents that I am sure I will get to come back plenty.

If I were grumpy today, I would give this place just one star.  During our fall break, the husband and I were knocking out quite a few of the best new restaurants in Phoenix Magazine, and this happened to be one of them.  I was pretty excited because I really like barbecue and it's fun to compare different places.  Unfortunately, this place didn't compare to any other BBQ place.  I honestly thought it was terrible, almost to the point of being inedible.  The restaurant itself is pretty cute.  I love the old western movies playing, the decor is rustic and cute, and its very clean inside.  Unfortunately, it must have been a really really REALLY off day for them, especially considering the raves from Deb (and I trust her reviews.)  I ordered the beef brisket with a side of the Cowboy Olive Cole Slaw.  It sounded fascinating.  Before our meal arrived I got some extra BBQ sauce, and that was the first indicator that this would be no good for me.  Honestly, the sauce tasted like hot sauce with a little bit of ketchup in it.  It was really watery, and I like really thick sauces.  I just really hated the flavor.  My brisket was terribly dry and overcooked.  There was no falling apart as I cut it, mostly just sawing motions to get through the nearly 1/2 inch slab.  I think brisket should be cut much thinner than that.  Fortunately, there was a decent smokey flavor that was present, and that made my meat palatable.  I figured the cole slaw would be better.  It wasn't.  It really just tasted like someone emptied a can of olive juice into a generic batch of cole slaw.  The only thing worth eating here was the baked potato salad, but it wasn't my side dish to eat.  This place was a big ol let down for me.  Like I said, this must have been a really bad day for them, because I don't think you win one of the best new restaurant spots for nothing.

What a great place this is!  The owner is super friendly and knowledgeable, plus he has an awesome car.  I found their selection to be pretty well balanced in terms of cats and dogs.  Everything looks to be of very high quality.  It's nice to have animal owners who truly care opening up stores for other like-minded people.  They have a good selection of food, treats, clothing, and essentials.  The clothing is definitely geared toward the much smaller dogs, but still very cute stuff.  They also have a nice assortment of pet-related gifts.  I got my mom an adorable little Scottie dog frame for Christmas.  A definite must-visit in the world of pet-product stores.

I finally made it to PastaBAR today with my husband and mother in law.  I am so glad we decided to come here over the Turf.  When someone else is paying, you should ALWAYS choose the more expensive place.  I am so glad that we finally made it here.  Aside from the price being a bit of a deterrent for me, I am really picky and there are lots of things on the menu that don't particularly make me salivate.  That being said, I came here with no objections and an open mind.  Plus, after watching so much Hell's Kitchen, I wanted to know what good, fresh pasta tastes like.  I found out that it actually tastes like heaven.  I chose the gnocchi alla lupa (I think it is called that) which was decadent little pillows of potato dumplings covered in a beautiful sausage ragu.  Wow.  The perfect little potato clouds were practically melt in your mouth.  I am so going to try making these at home now that I know how incredible they can be.  The portion was a perfect size, leaving me very satisfied.  After tasting the pasta here, I understand the price point.  It is perfectly fair considering the excellent quality and workmanship of the delicious pasta.    My husband and mother in law both got the lunch special.  One of them had the cavatelli with pesto and the other had cavatelli with pomodoro sauce.  Both of these dishes were delicious as well.  I really appreciated the lightness of the pesto sauce.  I didn't feel like I was ingesting a few cloves of garlic per bite.  It was a very season appropriate dish.  We were less than impressed with the salads though.  The odd pairing of ingredients made for a less than appetizing side.  This group is not a fan of celery, which could be the reason why we didn't like the salad.  I wouldn't suggest the lemonade, it was incredibly tart, and almost to the point of not being drinkable.  Overall, I was very pleased with this place.  I will be back again when I am feeling rich.  If PastaBAR ever decides to add a lovely cream sauce to their menu, I will definitely make this a five star restaurant in my book.  Another wonderful restaurant to add to the burgeoning strip of foodie heaven along 1st street.

The husband and I went here for breakfast the other morning at about 9 am.  The patio was about 2/3 full but the inside was empty.  When you first walk in, you are greeted with menus that are extremely reminiscent of Pei Wei.  Turns out, you order the exact same way at said restaurant and you even get a number and choose your own table.  As I sat waiting for my food, I contemplated whether or not this concept worked well for breakfast.  The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.  So many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.    Back to the concept of this place... once it had started to pick up again in terms of customers, I noticed how quickly the cashier was able to clear out the line.  I also noticed that the food was coming out at a really quick pace, and absolutely nothing sat on the line waiting to be served.  It works really well, but I am most interested in seeing how it works when the place gets absolutely slammed.  Overall, this is an excellent place to try.  You will not be disappointed with your fresh and delicious breakfast that doesn't make you feel heavy and gross after you leave.  A cool place for sure.

We tried The Turf on their big opening night.  They had a band playing some great Irish music at a volume that I could actually still communicate with my husband.  There were even a few girls who got up to do that step dance business during a couple songs.  I'm not sure if they were with the band, with the owners, or just so happened to be eating at an Irish Pub dressed like Irish step dancers.  When we first walked in, their was no hostess table, just like Seamus McAffrey's so we spotted a booth in the back and nestled in.  Unlike Seamus though, there were no menus at the table, so we had to wait a few minutes before we were noticed and given menus.  In the meantime I noticed that there was absolutely nothing on the table.  It was a refreshing change from most places where you see salt, pepper, ketchup and all sorts of other crap on an otherwise beautiful dark wood table.  We ordered the kids corndog bites as an app, a corned beef and cabbage for me, and a bangers and mash for the husband.  The corndog bites are wicked good.  They should make it a full size entree.  They're super crispy and perfectly battered.  A side of seasoned waffle fries comes along with it.  The fries were also super crispy and delicious, and I don't even like waffle fries.  I had never had corned beef and cabbage, so I didn't know what to expect.  The meat was very tender and slightly salty.  Paired with the slightly softened and piping hot cabbage, it was certainly a winning combination for me.  The steamed carrots and baby potatoes were also tasty.  I could have used a bit more seasoning in the veggies though.  I didn't try any of the bangers and mash, but I did try the gravy and it was excellent.  Thick and salty, just the way I like it.  Feeling very satisfied, but ready to get the full experience, we ordered the Whiskey Cake.  WHOA!  I was not ready for it.  The bundt style pound cake was dense, soaked with whiskey, and served with fresh whipped cream.    I mean soaked.  I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore so I scooped up and ate the foamy fresh whipped cream covered in green clover sprinkles.  All in all, a positive experience.  I will definitely be back.  The staff just needs to learn to be extremely watchful of new faces in the crowd so they don't sit unattended for too long.

We tried The Turf for breakfast this weekend.  We were definitely not in the mood to wait a lifetime for Matt's after perusing the market, so we decided to head over to the Turf.  As expected, the place was empty except for one guy at the bar... considering it was like 9 am I am really hoping this guy was just drinking apple juice.  Our server was very nice, and I am pretty sure we had her on our first night here.  After explaining to us what black and white pudding was, ewww, and then running away, she came back for our breakfast order.  I got the Bacon and Cheese Omelet and the husband got Biscuits and Gravy.  My breakfast was served with hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns were thin and crispy, just the way I like it.  My omelet was stuffed to the max with bacon and oozing melty cheese.  It wasn't a big fluffy omelet like at IHOP but it was a dense solid little guy.  I much prefer my omelets to be like this.  The husband was a little less than pleased with his meal.  We both agreed the gravy was pretty good and we really liked that there was actually sausage in it, the way it should be.  The disappointment was definitely in the biscuits though.  They were certainly not fresh and definitely not homemade.  Considering how easy and quick biscuits are to make, this bummed me out.  To the owner of Turf:  If you want me to, I will be more than happy to come over and show you how to make a good biscuit.  If there are good, fresh biscuits, this could be a great dish.  Not the best for breakfast, but a good alternative for when we don't feel like waiting for hours in the hot morning sun.

The husband and I came here after work because I was starving.  Upon walking in, I was really excited and I felt like this was going to be a 5 star place.  The decor was simple and clean, and it kind of reminded me of my house.  Then it became a 4 star place when our order came to 23 dollars.  A little pricey for me.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that touted applewood smokey bacon along with a side of tater tots.  Yum!  Our food arrived, and well, I subtracted another star because it was sloppy looking and frankly, a tad unappetizing.  My tots were pretty dark but I happen to like mine overcooked so they are really crispy.  Other people may be very disappointed with this.  The burger was very large, but the patty was very commercial.  My bacon was the biggest disappointment.  It was translucent!  I expected nice thick cut bacon when ordering an expensive burger.  The taste was no better than appearance.  It was incredibly grease laden, so much so that it made the bun soggy.  Additionally, I am 99.4% sure that everything they used comes from Costco.  The patties were definitely the same ones that come in a big stack with sheets of paper between them.  The bacon was definitely the kind that comes in the big giant reseable Kirkland bag.  Yikes.  Not good.  We're down to two stars.  After I didn't finish eating my burger, I felt pretty gross.  It took a few minutes to sink in, but I realized I just put an immense amount of grease into my tummy.  I am not one to shy away from greasy diner breakfasts and the like, but holy crap, this was a new level.  I didn't feel well.  An hour later, I am definitely sick  Now we are down to one star.  I have a wicked stomach ache as I write this review.  Ugh.  I want to vomit so I can just get this crap out and pretend it never happened.  What a disappointment.

This may be my new favorite Spring Training facility!  I've been to every one in the Cactus League except for the one in Goodyear, but that's coming soon.  This park is absolutely gorgeous.  Everything from the rolling hills to the carefully crafted winding paths that lead to the practice fields is stunning.  I've never seen a facility quite like this, well except for the old Dodger camp, Vero Beach, but that's Florida.    I love the Arizona feel of this stadium.  Usually I hate everything about Arizona from the ugly desert landscape to the mind blowing heat.  This stadium however seems to capture what it is about AZ that people find beautiful.  The angular design of this place creates beautiful lines throughout the park creating a backdrop for the sandy earthy colors you will find throughout the park.  The chairs are a sandy tan color, providing a sliver of relief from the heat that usually emanates from the typical dark green or dark blue seats of other stadiums.  The practice fields are as equally beautiful and well maintained as the actual playing field.  This is a stadium that takes pride in its aesthetics.   The food selection here is pretty mediocre.  You have the typical hot dog and sausage varietals along with some BBQ and grilled items.  Nothing too inventive, unless you sit in the 90 dollar home plate club seats.  WOW.  They have this incredible set up on the concourse for this exclusive club where you have a buffet of food, sweets, and drinks to choose from, not the typical hot dogs beer and popcorn fare.  Maybe we can shell out for that sometime.  I call myself a Diamondbacks fan but after all the betrayal from the team and my near constant visits to Camelback Ranch, I see myself becoming a Dodger fan.  It's scary, and my husband swears I will convert by the end of Spring Training.  I even now possess my very own Andre Ethier shirt.  At least I can pass that off as supporting a local boy.. plus he's cute.  Go here.  Don't hesitate, just do it and you will be so glad you did.

Five stars for being the best hot dog I ever had, even if it was a weird variation on one.  Our experience here was a little bit frustrating to say the least.  However, the experience was in no way through fault of Pittsburgh Willy's.  Apparently the antique market does a giant flea market out front every now and then, and it just so happened that when we went, it was the day.  Parking was impossible and the crowds were ridiculous.  For that reason, Pittsburgh Willy's was only serving hot dogs, stuff they could pump out quickly.  I suppose that's reasonable.  I can't really blame them.  I ordered the Chicken Willy which was a blend of chicken and spinach along with some spices and asiago cheese.  It was really really tasty and extremely juicy.  It had great bursts of spices that kept things interesting despite the fact that I didn't get any toppings on mine.  The owner came out and chatted with us for a good while and he is a genuinely nice guy.  It seems as though they will be expanding in the near future so keep an eye out.  Also, be sure to bring cash with you.  They don't have a POS machine yet.

I LOVE me some good donuts.  My husband and I have even ran all over Phoenix in search of donuts only to find that most of the stores were either out of business or closed for the day, at 11 am.  Ugh.  One day I was craving donuts, this is not unusual, and on the way to my mother-in-law's house my husband pulled off the freeway and into the parking lot of Lamar's.  We were greeted by the warm and cozy smell of fresh donuts.  After looking over their rather impressive collection of delectable looking donuts, I narrowed it down to a maple bar, always my favorite, and a fritter of some type of fruit.  My donuts were absolutely delicious.  They were fresh and tasty.  They were super soft and yummy inside.  Lamar's is a fantastic place for donuts.  The cashiers are always nice too.

Culture Fresh is a unique and exciting clothing store that makes a great contribution to the Downtown Phoenix art and fashion culture.  That being said, I don't expect trendy socialite type girls to be buying anything from this store.  This is definitely a Hip-Hop centric store.    The space that this boutique occupies in the otherwise awful Arizona Center is cool, clean, and filled with awesome local art.  Lalo Cota is most certainly favored in here.  Most of the clothing in here is limited to T-Shirts and hoodies for men while the women have a bit more to choose from.  Along the front of the store are locally designed dresses, skirts, and blouses.  A lot of stuff in here is styled like graffiti, which is definitely very cool.  They even carry a small selection of one of a kind graffitied shoes that are done during their Shoe Shows.  You will also find lots of Phoenix-centric shirts, a personal favorite of mine.  If this is your style, you can't pass this place by.  With low prices and quality merchandise, Culture Fresh is a shining example of what the Arizona Center should be filled with as opposed to empty spaces and personality-free gift shops.

If you have never gone antique/vintage shopping on 7th, you are really missing out.  There are so many wonderful and unique shops to visit on such a short stretch of road.  Rust and Roses is definitely in the Shabby Chic category in terms of the pieces they carry.  Along with some really great iron pieces in the back there is some great artwork and random pieces inside the store.  Our most recent vintage purchase came from here.  We got a beautiful repurposed cabinet door that has an inset of chalkboard.  This is just one example of the many great pieces at this store.  They also carry a decent selection of jewelry near the checkout counter.  I noticed that in general, the prices were pretty moderate and comparable to other similar stores in the area.  I really like this store and I am very glad I stopped in this weekend.

I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others.

Who doesn't like popcorn?  Especially popcorn with all sorts of unique and yummy flavors.  I'm sure everyone has been on the receiving end of one of those weird tri-flavored popcorn tins that always has the most boring flavors in them.  At Poppa Maize you can actually customize that tri-flavored tin into a gift that your foodie receiver is sure to appreciate.  I've never actually been in their store, but I have sampled a great deal of their flavors.  They offer these awesome little single serving sample deals so you can figure out your favorites.  They have a TON of flavors, and the list would be too long for here, so check out their site for that.  Among the flavors I have tried are: Apple Cinnamon (sweet and earthy tasting), Backyard Barbeque (a great alternative to chips), Cheesy Chipotle (spicy and tangy, a great combo), Toasted Almond (light flavor but tasty), Toasted Coconut (YUM), German Chocolate (just like the cake in popcorn form), Chili y Lime (tart and spicy) , Strawberries n Cream (fresh and fruity, an old fashioned flavor), Pina Colada (very sweet and tropical), S'Mores (yummy) , White Chocolate (extremely sweet), and Chocolate Chocolate Chip (chocolate overload).  If you are looking for extra tasty popcorn to snack on or you want a nice little treat for someone, this is a great place to go.  Their prices really can't be beat when it comes to this kind of quality product.  Yay popcorn!

I really hate giving places 1 star reviews, but in this case, it was very well deserved.  We came here around 10 or so and the place was pretty much full, and by full, I mean all 10 or so of their tables were occupied.  Fortunately, there were tables outside, so we grabbed one despite the clouds looming overhead.    We sat there for a little while and enjoyed the cooler weather and perused the menus.  I was immediately turned off after noticing that almost everything on the menu contains onions.  Of course you can just ask for them to be removed, but for many people, they simply won't order something because of that.  We sat there for a while and the waitress finally came back to take our drink order, but specifically said we couldn't order our meal yet.  WTF, we're ready, and this is already taking long enough.  When she comes back out, entirely too much later, I ordered the starter which is two eggs, toast, and hashbrowns.    Once our order was put in, we didn't see the waitress for another 30 minutes.  This is unacceptable for breakfast.  I was watching the window like a hawk and noticing the awfully slow rate at which food was going out to tables who were there well before we were.  The clouds decided to have some fun with us and began raining.  It got progressively worse until two of the outside tables went inside and stood, waiting for their food.  You'd think they would maybe expedite the food or something.  We stuck it out for about 5 more minutes and then gave up, realizing our food was never coming out.  We paid for the chocolate milk, and left.  The sad thing was, they didn't even do anything to rectify the situation.  This place is an absolute joke.  If you cannot handle the business you are receiving with the staff you have on hand, you need to hire more.  Not only that, but they need better servers.  The couldn't care less attitude of this place is pathetic.  I don't blame them one bit for the raining, and I certainly don't blame them one bit for being busy.  I do blame them for being careless and quite frankly, terrible at their jobs.  I kid you not, we went next door to the Filiberto's and got breakfast in less time than it took for us to even get our drinks.  Avoid Red Bird Cafe at all costs!

If it weren't for the absolutely terrible parking situation, I would give this place 5 stars.  My husband and I have been driving by this place every single day after work.  It has been lots of fun watching the change from Katz to Postino.  Finally, on Monday, we drove by and saw it open.  We immediately turned around, and then around and around again trying to find parking.  We gave up and decided to plan on it two days later.  Well, two days later arrived and we found a place to park across the street and next to the gas station.   Everything else is worth 5 stars.  The service here was impeccable.  Our server was both friendly and knowledgeable.  Every server in the restaurant was attentive, I had seen a few different ones stop by our table to clear our plates or refill our water.  It was really nice to see servers that operated like a family.  The food was out of this world.  Usually, I don't get salads, but the raspberry chicken salad sounded too good to pass up, and it was wonderful.  It was very appropriate in size, and quite filling.  The raspberry dressing went so well with the gorgonzola and apples.  The lettuce was fresh and tasty.  The bread they served with it was also quite good.  I'm going to guess it was some kind of blueberry walnut bread.  We also got a grilled cheese to share.  I love grilled cheese, and this one was fantastic.  They served it with three dipping sauces, mustard, ketchup, and pesto.  All three of them were excellent with the sandwich.  Their wine list seems to be pretty well rounded but I don't know anything about wine.  I love that Postino is on the way home from work.  The relaxed vibe of this place makes me really comfortable in here whether I am dressed up from work or wearing jeans and a t-shirt on a weekend.  Phenomenal place.

Okay, I was super excited about this place when I finally realized what it was while we were in the drive-through.  I wasn't excited however about their complicated menu.  I did the build your own combo thing and I just wanted a single patty cheeseburger with bacon on it.  I got the cheese curds as a side because... well how could I not.  Fried cheese.  After pulling past the pay window we waited for a good 7-10 minutes for our food.  That was irritating.  I like the whole made-to-order thing, but Jack In the Box manages to do it faster.  I gobbled up all my cheese curds within moments.  Ya, they were really good.  There was a mix of white and yellow cheese in there.  The flavor of them was just delicious.  Unfortunately, my burger was all sorts of wrong.  I opened the wrapping to find a ridiculously misshapen double cheeseburger inside.  I wanted one less patty and some bacon.   I guess that was too much to ask.  Anyway, it looked unappetizing based off of the strangely shaped patties and the fact that it was so greasy I couldn't get my hands to grip it without crap falling out the other end.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was just getting a snack.  The cheese curds are great, but that's about it.

I could retell the entire awful experience that happened here, but I'd rather not relive it and you can just read Glenn's review instead.  In case you don't long story short is incompetent server wearing little clothing can't do anything right, spills ketchup on friend's white shirt.  I checked out the menu for this place online, and I was super excited, there were a lot of things that sounded great.  Unfortunately, this is one of those really irritating places that has a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  I ended up ordering the meatloaf sandwich.  The meatloaf sandwich was less than satisfying.  It was served open faced, which was cool, but that left the congealed gravy to cool almost instantly.  The bread underneath was really tough and hard to eat with the meatloaf.  The meatloaf itself was overcooked, practically blackened, and it had peppers in it.  I thought it was weird and rather unappealing.  I don't think mushroom gravy and peppers belong together.  Service was just downright awful, but I think it was only the girl we got stuck with.  She was rather rude and pretentious.  A particular moment in time that stuck out to me was when we commented how heavy the menus were she shot back at us "well you're not the one carrying them all day."  Sure sweetheart...  I'm pretty sure she is a trust fund baby who is now forced to work her first job ever because of the economy.  She picked the wrong one.  I think there is another location and maybe, just maybe we could go back to try that one.  Surely the servers are a little more well seasoned that the incompetent broad we had.

I don't have a whole lot to say about this place other than the Crispy Steak is the way to go!  A big burrito sized tortilla stuffed with steak, mushrooms, and cheese and deep fried is certainly the way to my heart.  In a word, DELICIOUS!  Their lemonade stuff is kind of weird, and the pineapple flavor of the month wasn't really there.  Who cares when you have all that fried goodness to indulge in instead.  If you are out and about in this area, this is a pretty good place to stop and try.

I have been really hesitant to start visiting BBQ joints because of a lot of recent strikeouts.  I've always been so disappointed to maintain that my favorite BBQ place is Famous Daves (Boo Chains!)  I finally gave in and decided to give Andrew's BBQ a shot.    Walking into the shop, we were pretty confused.  There was a giant space in the wall that lead to the kitchen and then a large open area with tables, a pass through window and a cooler on the side.  We weren't sure if we sat down and waited for someone to help us or where we supposed to order.  Thankfully a girl came out and was extremely friendly and helpful.  I want to say her name was Dana or something very close to that.  I ended up ordering the 1/2lb chicken plate which came with a piece of jalapeno cornbread and a side, I picked coleslaw.  The food didn't take very long to come out and it looked wonderful.  I'm pretty sure the cook was feeling generous because I got wayyyy more chicken than I ordered, but I'm not complaining.  It was lunch for two more days.  The first thing I tried was the coleslaw and it was refreshingly different.  It was tangy and slightly sweet with some herbs I'm not quite sure of.  My best guess is dill.  The chicken was quite good, but a tiny bit dry.  It still retained all of its great flavor and was only made better by the AMAZING bbq sauce.  I have been on a search for the greatest bbq sauce, and this is definitely a contender.  It's thick and rich, kind of sweet, a little bit spicy, a little smokey, but a whole lot of flavor.  I really loved it!  I think they sell it, and I may have to purchase some.  Overall, I was really pleased with Andrew's BBQ, but I would like to come back and try their brisket and maybe another side before I determine where they fit on my scale of barbecue greatness.

A while back we picked up some Sweet Italian Sausage from the Farmer's Market and we kept it in our freezer.  Finally we broke out the good stuff to make our own bangers and mash and it was DELICIOUS!  The sausage is flavorful yet mild and the insides are really tender and they crumble when you cut into it.  You can just tell by looking at it, that this is good stuff.  It also smells wonderful as it's cooking.  I really enjoyed it and thought it tasted great.  I will definitely be sampling more of their meat.

I will never like the jellyfish for many reasons, but I can't help but fall in love with the beautiful park space that lies just beneath it.  This area is a great mixture of grass, rock landscaping, a little bit of rolling hills and plenty of trees that will one day mature into something impressive.  On the south end of the park there is a totally awesome light pillar thing that is very cool to check out.  I only saw a couple transients, thankfully, and for the most part the people in the park seemed to be ASU students reading in the grass.  I wish this had opened a couple months earlier so I could have enjoyed it longer, but at least I can still hang out here at 9:00 at night.  The only drawback is that there is a large amount of smokers that like to chill here.  Eww.

I'm excited to be the first REAL review of this place.  We decided to stop by here in favor of Postino, as we have already been multiple times, and boy am I glad we did.  This is like the 4th or 5th, or maybe 12th different restaurant inside the ever-so-lovely Clarendon Hotel.  In what seems to be a revolving door of restaurant concepts in this rather charming space, I think we have finally found a winner.  Gallo Blanco does something that not enough restaurants do.  They downsize their menu drastically to have only a few different options for lunch/dinner, and a few options for breakfast, plus a few assorted appetizers.  I much prefer a restaurant to have a few things on the menu that they perfect rather than a whole bunch of items that are only so-so.  The dinner menu offers a few entrees including steak and chicken and then there are tortas or tacos with your choice of delectable meat stuffed inside.  The husband and I ordered the cheese crisp (not what you think) and the pork sandwiches.  I would give the Spanish names, but I've got nothing for ya.    The cheese crisp was a fantastic giant fried concoction.  It seems like it was a large tortilla, or something, covered in cheese and deep fried wrapped around something round.  It was really good, I can't describe it much better, just get it if you go.  The pork tortas were so delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  it was mixed with some shredded lettuce, a couple slices of fresh avocado, and there was a delightfully tangy/spicy sauce underneath.  The bread was unbelievably tasty, slightly sweet with a perfect texture.  I was excited to actually have a true torta bun instead of your average run of the mill hamburger bun.  We decided to split the chocolate pudding for dessert.  It was served in a small tumbler.  The chocolate pudding wasn't a traditional pudding and was much thinner.  However, it went perfectly with the graham crackers and the truly homemade marshmallow fluff.  The marshmallow stuff was soooooo good and you can taste the quality.  A tasty yet simple dessert.  What a great experience!  I only took away one star because the restaurant was far from busy but the wait for food was a little too long to be deemed acceptable.  However, our server was so sweet and charming, and her English accent was almost unbearably adorable.  It was her first day on the job but she was phenomenal.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone and I hope we finally have a permanent resident in the Clarendon restaurant space.

This was a surprisingly good Denny's.  We were heading out of Phoenix but wanted to grab breakfast on our way out and we stopped by here.  Outside, it looks kind of abandoned.  You see signs on the windows and a few people inside, but the lack of cars is a little startling considering every other Denny's is usually jam-packed at 10:30AM.  It's all about the area though.  There isn't a whole lot around here, so I can see how it can be so UN-crowded.  The restaurant was only about 1/4 full so we were seated immediately.  Our server, Nataly, came by very quickly and took our drink order.  When she came back we were ready to order.  5 minutes later, our order was out.  I got the Grand Slamwich and the husband got his usual Moons Over My Hammy.  My sandwich was 1 scrambled egg (more like 4 judging the size of this thing), sausage, bacon, american cheese, and mayo all sandwiched between potato bread that is grilled with some sort of maple spice stuff.  It's very good.  It also comes with a side of hashbrowns.  It's really cheap at only $4.99 but there is also a Super Grand Slamwich.  I don't know how anyone can eat any more.  I only ate half and had two bites of the hashbrowns.  A strange thing we noticed however is the price difference between my sandwich and the husband's sandwich.  They were almost identical in size, almost identical in fillings, and both came with hash browns.  His, however, was $7.99.  Not that I am complaining about price or anything, but I couldn't figure out where that discrepancy came from.  Oh well.  Bottom line, this is a great Denny's with great service, and better than usual food.  It was a nice experience to not be bumping into people and hearing screaming children.  I would definitely go out of my way to stop by this location as opposed to one closer to my house.

Finally, number 300!!!  I better make this good.  I could not have been more excited to come to this place after coming home from a summer long trip in Washington.  Since we weren't footing the bill, we went all out and pretty much tried everything that sounded good to us.    Our server was sweet as can be and she was quite helpful.  When we asked what she would pick between two drinks, she didn't give the usual crap line "oh well, it depends on what mood you're in" and she told us exactly which one she liked best.  That made our decision for drinks the Watermelon Agua.  It was ridiculously tasty and refreshing.    For an appetizer we ordered the Eggplant Bruschetta, and unfortunately I can't quite remember the name of it.  In any event, I have never tried eggplant before and I was feeling adventurous.  I was certainly glad I did because the sweet and sour eggplant combined with the herbed ricotta spread and slightly charred bread made for an absolutely delicious and perfect sized appetizer for 3.  We decided it would be best to split 2 of the 12 inch pizzas so we would have some leftovers.  We chose the Yukon Potato pizza (gorgonzola, leeks, yukon gold potatoes) and the Pepperoni pizza (um, pepperoni, basil, and red sauce).  Both pizzas were absolutely delicious!  The crust was thin underneath, but at the ends it was nice and substantial and great to eat on its own.  The ingredients on both pizzas were of exceptional quality and tasted great.  For dessert we went with the special of the day which was an Italian Lemon Pudding dessert served with a ginger cookie.  The pudding was very heavy, almost custard like, but it had the smoothness of regular pudding.  The flavor was intensely lemon and it tasted delicious with the ginger cookie dipped in.  I would recommend this dessert be shared as the flavor is very strong and best shared with another person.  Overall, I was immensely happy with this place.  The interior was cool and modern without being overt.  I loved how their "centerpiece" of the southern wall was carried out as a theme.  The take-out box had that motif as well as the border of their menus.  Possibly my favorite part of my visit was when we left and were admiring their garden.  The chef came out to grab some eggplant to use and we had a lovely chat with him and before we left he even offered a garden-fresh eggplant.  That was awesome.  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  I am so glad that we have this awesome new joint in a location I often find myself wandering.  Woohoo!

I've been here about 3 times now and I figured I should write an update.  I still love this place.  The more I think about it, the more I am sure this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix!  The second and third time I visited the Parlor I discovered that I could create my own pizza!  Sweet!  One time the husband and I split a twelve inch and added ricotta, schreiner's parlor blend sausage, wild mushrooms, and oregano.  It was a magnificent pizza and we even had leftover!  Of course we did get the eggplant bruschetta to start.  The last time I was there, just the other day in fact, I decided to get the small 8 inch pizza for myself.  This time I added ricotta, house-made mozzarella, schreiner's parlor blend sausage, and applewood smoked bacon.  OMG!  It was so good and the bacon was the best possible thing I could have added.  It was delicious and WAY more food than one person can eat on their own.  It was more like a medium sized pizza you can get at any of the pizza chains, but much, much tastier!  I also checked out the bathrooms this time and they are super cute with subway tiling and some great artwork.  I LOVED the vintage pictures of the restaurant when it was actually a parlor.  Great stuff!  In case you were wondering, I'm officially addicted to The Parlor.

I was not feeling 25 Degrees.  Had they not been in the laughable City North, I might have given them an extra star, but they're not, so two it is.  When we came, it was pretty much empty except for a couple tables out on the patio because it was nice out.  We elected to sit outside too.  This first thing I hated was their menus.  You get this huge board game sized piece of paper sandwiched between two pieces of plexiglass and then held together with a thick rubber band.  They just seemed tacky!  Obviously, I came here for the burgers, so I read through my options and decided that build my own was the way to go.  I started getting hesitant about the price, because just a couple add ons were going to make my burger cost about 15 bucks or so.  It better be good.  I settled on a sirloin burger with barbecue sauce, crispy onions, and bacon.  We also got an order of fries to share (also quite expensive.)  The fries were just okay, but I did like the seasoning.  It just needed more.  The burger on the other hand was a HUGE let down.  Just because you give me a massive patty plopped between a sky high bun does not make the value any better.  The patty itself was at least an inch and a half thick, so when I requested my burger to be cooked medium, I got something closer to well done around the outside with only a sliver of pink on the inside.  Not so cool.  The burger itself was very bland.  You can't just throw ground sirloin on a grill and call it a burger.  There needs to be some love and seasoning or else it just won't work.  I did like the barbecue sauce, but that was it.  The bacon had no flavor and added nothing in terms of texture, unless you want to call tough and chewy an improvement.  The crispy onions, my most anticipated feature, were actually the worse.  It seemed to me like they were fried way in advance, allowed to cool, and then stuck on there.  They were cold, tough, and stringy.  Obviously, this was unappetizing.  I ate about a quarter of my burger, making a huge mess because of the astronomical proportions, before I decided that it just wasn't worth it.  I definitely will NOT be coming back to 25 Degrees and it's only a matter of time before this lame development collapses into its own filth.

Wow, this place has such an eclectic mix of furniture!  Out front they had a crazy red chaise lounge with gold emblems all over it, inside there is a 12 foot long spanish style dining table and a contemporary/modern bed frame.  There is literally something for everyone here.  The best part is that everything is totally affordable and their prices are really low.  I've been to thrift stores that charge more than they do here!  There were a lot of things in here that I wanted to buy but I don't have any more room in my house.  This is really a great consignment store with lots of high quality well priced pieces.  Definitely give it a try!

This was maybe one of the biggest food disappointments I have ever had.  My family lives out in the EV and my mom handed me a magazine that pointed out great places to eat in the EV.  Granted, most of them were chains, but we figured why not give the place that got a cover a shot?  First let me tell you that the cover picture was two beautiful Belgian Waffles stacked on top of each other and loaded with fresh strawberries and yummy whipped cream.  I was enticed by this and chose to order a waffle instead of their namesake.  I got the pecan waffle.  Despite being described as malted and loaded with pecans, I got a box mix tasting waffle with a sprinkling of pecans.  I paid 8 dollars for this?  Wow.  The syrup was imitation syrup and the waffles were irritatingly served on itty bitty plates that made a mess.  I would also like to point out that a friend did get the strawberry waffle and it looked nothing like the cover.  She got maybe one strawberry and a blob of Cool Whip.  Sad.  On top of the terrible food and ridiculous prices, the service was awful!  The restaurant was beginning to clear out by the time we got in, so no excuses.  Our drinks took forever to get to us, and that sat empty for the rest of the meal, our food took forever, and it took us forever to get out of there!  This is an all around issue, not just the waitstaff.  To make matters even better, the atmosphere is laughable.  It looks like they painted the walls, slapped some mismatched Kirkland's crap on the walls and called it a restaurant.  This place is a sham.  I will never be back and I have already told my friends and family to steer clear and save their money.

I am so sad that this place was nothing like I had hoped.  The husband had informed me that PHX was going to be getting a candy store and my eyes lit up and I began dreaming of all my candy adventures I would soon be having.  We stopped by this morning and I was so excited to see what kind of vintage/old school candy they would have.  Instead I was inundated with novelties and kiddie toys.  When I turned around I checked out the pretty small selection of candies.  There weren't a lot to choose from and a lot of them were licorice.  The prices seemed a little much to me.  Instead of advertising "sweets-treats-novelty" it should really say "novelty-kiddie stuff-some candy".  I am just really hoping that they are just testing the waters right now and seeing what works and what doesn't so I will be back in a while.  For now, I am sadly unimpressed.

I was hoping to find something trendy and unique for my friend for Christmas, so we thought Loveland would be a good place to try.  It definitely is!  While they have a HUGE selection of adorable little kid clothes, that wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  They have an impressive array of delicate jewelry and headbands.  While I loved most of it, I just wasn't looking for that style.  There are lots of pretty dresses and blouses, all at good prices, and a decent amount of interesting guy shirts as well.  Loveland is a really cool place that I will keep in mind when shopping for myself and others in the future.

This is one of the newest DQ's around.  They are also one of the most busiest yet most efficient locations.  Every time we go here, no matter what time of day or night, there is a ridiculous line in the drive through, you would swear it was In-N-Out at lunchtime.  Luckily the staff is able to move very quickly through all those customers.  On every visit there I have found the cashiers to be quite friendly.  The majority of the people who work here are high school kids, but they all seem to have a pretty good time.  Their blizzards are some of the better ones here, and they tend to get them mixed pretty well all the way to the bottom.  Sometimes you get a little cheated on the mix-ins and sometimes they are generous, but it's usually pretty consistent.  If you can, see if Jeff can make your blizzard, they're the best.  That was a shameless plug for my little bro, but he really does make a killer blizzard.

I've only been here once, but due to the fact that the food was excellent and the experience was wonderful, I have to give up the 5th star.  To say I am a picky eater would certainly be an understatement, so I really have no idea what was going on in my head when I decided to try Karey's Kitchen.  I pretty much hate Mexican food and have no idea what Filipino food is, so this was pretty daring for me.  When we came in it was empty, thankfully, so we got to sample lots of food and ask all of our stupid questions to the super sweet girl behind the counter.  She wasn't shy about offering her recommendations when I asked, and I really appreciated that.  After tasting a bunch of dishes I decided on the Chicken Adobo Burrito.  It came with a side of garlic rice and chips and salsa.  The salsa I didn't eat because that's just too far out of my comfort zone.  The rice was good, but I honestly wouldn't mind if there was more garlic in it.  The burrito was absolutely heavenly!  I'm the kind of girl who likes stuff pretty plain.  Just the meat and cheese thank you very much.  To my surprise, that is exactly the way my burrito came... stuffed with chicken and loaded with ooey gooey cheese!  It was even covered in something that tasted like paremesan crumbs.  Yum!  I really cannot wait to go back here and try something new and maybe overcome a few more of my culinary fears.

I've been hesitant to try Nine 05 for a really long time.  I had a terrible experience at Fate and that really tarnished the image of the new restaurant for me.  Finally, on our way home after a long day, we gave Nine 05 a try.  I am so glad I did.  I can honestly stay that this was one of the most stimulating meals that I have ever consumed.  From start to finish my taste buds were dancing with all sorts of flavors that I have never experienced together.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Nine 05 for not being another Fate.  I ordered the house made lychee soda to drink and I loved it!  It was perfectly sweet and efervescent, really, a perfect complement to my meal.  We chose the rice cakes as a starter , and we definitely weren't sure what to expect.  The husband called them French Toasted Rice Sticks, but I call them yummy.  The exterior was perfectly crisp while the inside was creamy and sticky, a perfect foil to the crispness.  The coconut cream sauce served alongside it was perfect when drizzled with a bit of soy sauce.  For my entree I chose the Tonkotsu Ramen.  I really had no idea what I was getting other than noodles and pork belly.  I'm not an expert on Asian food or the way it should be prepared, but this was scrumptious.  It was a rather chilly night and I didn't have a coat or anything and the soup warmed me from the inside out.  The broth had a light flavor that slowly developed into a spice that got you right in the back of the throat.  The pork belly was to die for and I kept looking for more even after they were long gone.  The noodles were good and not too mushy.  This is the dish I want when I'm feeling under the weather and in need of some comforting food.  I've heard a lot of great things about the blueberry mochi cake, so I insisted that we try it.  I'm so glad we did because it was the perfect end to my exciting meal.  The cake was tender and flavorful.  The blueberries were deliciously sweet.  The sorbet on top of it all was wonderful and the sauces drizzled around were intensely good.  I am so happy I finally gave Nine 05 a try.  It does everything right in my book, especially the revamped interior.  The bright, open, clean look is a wonderful contrast from the previous restaurants dark, dingy, hazy look.  I WILL be coming back.

My picky palate is not very adventurous.  That's why this year I resolved to eat more adventurously.  I've done a pretty good job so far, and now I have finally tried Pho/Vietnamese!  I'm really proud of myself!  We were originally going to Maxim, but they were closed so we found another place to try Pho.  It was really cold out, and a bowl of piping hot soup just sounded delightful.  We walked in and almost every table was full of Vietnamese couples and families.  There were a few other white people in there, but I took that as a good sign.  They wouldn't eat here if it wasn't good, right?  We found the last empty table and quickly seated ourselves.  Someone walked by and dropped menus off on our table like a ninja and we began reading through the foreign novel.  There were so many things on there, and at least half of them scared the crap out of me!  I stuck with my original intentions and got the Pho with the beef slices along with an order of egg rolls.    My egg rolls came out before the Pho and they were quite delicious.  I have no idea what was in them, but they were full of flavor and meaty goodness.  I gobbled them up pretty quickly.  Then came the Pho.  We got a couple GIANT bowls of steaming soup and a plate of garnish.  Now, keep in mind we had no idea how to really eat this, or what to do with all the stuff.  I just watched everyone else in the restaurant and figured it out that it's all personal preference.  I threw in a handful of bean sprouts, squeezed in some lemon, and squeezed in a spoonful or so of sriracha sauce.  My additions resulted in one delicious bowl of heart warming soup.  I scarfed most of the solid food down and sipped most of what was left of the broth.  Now I understand why everyone talks about Pho!  I love the level of customization and it really is the perfect remedy for whatever may ail you.  I can't wait to get some more!

Like Glenn said, I'm pretty surprised that we've never been here until now.  We've made numerous trips to ABC Cake Decorating across the street and many of them were tainted with hunger.  It's just surprising to me that we never even noticed the cool place across the street!  We finally came the other day, and I quite enjoyed my experience.  The place is pretty big with a lounge/seating on the west side, a bar in the middle, and lots more seating on the east side.  My only real frustration with the restaurant is the peanut shells on the floor and the bucket of peanuts on the table.  I really dislike that, but since I'm not allergic or anything, I'll live.  The service was nice and friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly.  I got the Southern Thang Burger.  Basically, it's a burger covered in yummy BBQ sauce, cheese, and crispy onions.  Yay!  I love crispy onions.  You have 5 or so options for your side including various interpretations on potatoes and I even think cottage cheese.  I chose the tots because I love tots.  My burger was pretty tasty and the tots were great.  I am definitely ready to come back here again.  It seems like a fun place to watch a game and grab some great food.

I really am a Bath Junkie.  I love bath products, especially environmentally friendly ones.  When I heard about this place through the Yelp events page, I got really really excited.  The idea of custom blending my own scent and then tinting it to a lovely shade of pink gets me all weak in the knees, so that's exactly what I did this weekend.  The store is located in the jumbled mess of Desert Ridge Marketplace, but just ignore that fact and go anyway.    Inside you will find a clean and simple yet inviting interior with a few ladies to help get you started.  Basically you pick a product, sit at the scent bar and choose up to four scents to combine, then you hand it to one of the ladies and they will mix it up for you, tint it your chosen color, and then label it so you don't forget what scents you chose.  AWESOME!  They also have lots of really cute gift packages to choose from.  I am going to spend a lot of money here, I can already tell.  Lucky me, I was chosen in a drawing to win a free 8 oz product!  YAY!  If you love bath products, you really have to go here.

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!  I LOVE CHEESE!  More importantly, I love Beecher's cheese from Seattle, and guess which place carries this lovely cheese...  This place is totally awesome.  They have a lovely selection of cheeses and everything looks and tastes fresh.  The staff is more than happy to get you samples or to give you some recommendations.  I will definitely be back many many times after I finish nibbling on my tiny blocks of Manchego and Beecher's Flagship cheeses.  YAY!

HOLY CHEESE CURDS!  Literally!  They are so good they have to be holy and heavenly and all associated greatness.  These are hands down the best cheese curds I have ever had in my life.  I've had Beecher's in Seattle, and they are good.  I've had some curds from the dairy farm run by the polygamists up in Colorado City and those are really good.  Nothing can even come close to how good the cheese curds are at Petit Fromage.  They make the best midnight snack in the world.  They actually make a great breakfast.  I can eat them all day long!  I got some last week and then I begged the husband every 5 minutes to take me back there to get some more after I finished.  Do yourself a favor.  Stop reading this and go to get some curds!  Make sure you leave some for me!

I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I am an absolute weenie when it comes to trying new places with foods I've never heard of before!  It's true.  Yes I have managed to review over 400 places before ever trying Thai food.  Weird, right?  Anyway, my New Year's Resolution this year was to be more adventurous when it came to dining, and I am determined to embrace that resolution.  I'm doing really well so far, I mean, I ate Thai food!  As we were walking in, I started freaking out a little bit, because when I get scared of food, I order something really lame, and then I get really grumpy.  I kept telling myself that this was just a different version of Chinese food, which I love.  Once we got inside, I had to stifle the laughter upon seeing the epic tables.  Each one could literally seat 10 people.  They don't have anything smaller.  Seriously.  Anyway, we sat down and were kind of ignored for a while, got menus, got ignored, got drinks, ordered, got ignored, got food, ignored again, paid, then left.  You get the idea here?  The service is pretty horrendous.    I didn't know what to order, and I found myself gravitating towards familiar things.  I told myself that ordering familiar would be pointless, so I went with Beef Pad See Yew.  I was definitely avoiding the spicy after seeing the table next to us sweating and crying after eating some soup that was a level 3.  Sheesh!  Once my dish (beef, broccoli, fat rice noodles, and bean sprouts) came out, I pretty much devoured what I could.  the portions were huge, and I ate about half.  It was really good!  I still don't know what I think of Thai food, but I did eat the leftovers the next day and still enjoyed them.  I probably won't come back here to dine in just because the service is a little much to handle, but it could be really fun with a big group.  I think take out would be the way to go.

I know that G-Spot has quite a few locations around the valley, but I have to say that this is by far, their best one.  The layout of this store is a little bit more open, so when/if it gets really busy, people can still manage to be organized.  My favorite part about this place is that we walked in at about 8 on the weekend (a crazy busy time for the Camelback location) and no one was there!  The staff was all really friendly and helpful and they seemed to be having a good time working there.  I did notice though that this location is a little bit cheap on the portion sizes as they make sure you get EXACTLY a level scoop of gelato and no more.  I don't care so much about though because it's still plenty for me!

This review is long overdue!  I actually first came here when they just opened, maybe even on the first day.  I absolutely loved it then, and I absolutely loved it again when we came for Office Hours!  Both times I have been here I have ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and the Veggie Frites.  So far, at least to me, this is the best burger in the Valley.  They season their burgers so much that it tiptoes along the lines of overkill, but I like it.  The burger is always juicy and fresh and the toppings are killer.  The BBQ sauce is thick and sweet and the perfect complement to the salty bacon and fried onion strings sitting atop the meat.  This is really a fantastic burger.  The Veggie Frites are yummy, especially the asparagus because the tops of them get all crispy.  They serve them with a generous side of ranch.  Yum!  Obviously, I love this place.  I am soooo excited to get one of these so close to downtown, but that is going to be a very dangerous thing.

I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.  We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!

I debated on this rating for awhile, but ultimately decided that I can't bump it up to a three star.  There were just way too many things here that disappointed me.    From the outside, the place is adorable and I love the bright color, it's really inviting.  However, I hate the place inside.  Had the decor been overkill hippie like in the burger place, I could sorta dig it, but this was all just halfway and I don't like a pair of pointy boobies staring down at me from a poster.  I HATED the rolling chairs that bumped into everyone and everything.  The place is entirely too cramped.  A lot of people get their food to go, so there is no reason to have that many tables.  There are just too many obstacles to make this even a semi-comfortable dining experience.  False advertising makes me angry and had I come here after 11:30 on the premise that breakfast is served all day, like they advertise, I would have been fuming.  Why call yourself a breakfast joint if I can get a burger all day but not some scrambled eggs?  There is way too much crap on the menu and I think that this place could really be much much better if they pared it down to just breakfast bowls and sides.  Practically everyone got one anyway, why slow the line down with messy pancakes and waffles?  Like Glenn said, there should also be little order forms that people can fill out while waiting in line.  Things would go so much smoother from there.  Aside from the many many things that irritated me, the food was only okay.  I got the breakfast "bowl" which is a great value, but was left a bit disappointed.  I love being able to choose my own ingredients, so that was cool, but the distribution of ingredients is sporadic.  Some parts of my egg were covered in cheese and bacon, while the mushrooms and sausage were sparsely sprinkled.  I would rather have it even all the way around.  The potatoes tasted okay, but were really greasy and ultimately made me not feel good later in the day.  That brings back the same feeling I got from the uber-greasy magic mushroom burger a while back.  Not good.  I probably won't be back unless some dramatic changes are made.  I don't mind waiting in line for food, but I hate waiting a long time after I have ordered.  I also don't understand how a "hippie" place that boasts of using organic ingredients could go and use inefficient, very expensive, not to mention environmentally unfriendly plastic and styrofoam containers.  That's a big boo from me.

I am so excited to have yet another awesome hot-spot added to the Phoenix restaurant scene.  I've been watching the renovations of this building for a while now and read the blog of all the fantastic things they have done inside the place, so I was waiting at the door 10 minutes before they opened.  Needless to say, I was pumped to finally eat here.  We were welcomed in a little bit before open time by Dana, the owner, who is a really awesome guy and his enthusiasm and excitement is truly infectious.  You can tell that this is his baby and he is so proud.  We were given menus which are minimized for the time being, but there are still a ton of stellar selections on there.  For a starter we chose the sweet potato fries and they were excellent.  They were not too sweet and had a fantastic texture.  Crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside made for a pretty addictive pre meal snack.  Next up was the ceviche, which was actually brought out complimentary by the chef.  I've never had ceviche before, but if this is what it all tastes like, I love it!  The fish was lovely and had a nice firm texture and the spices/peppers added a great bold flavor while the coconut milk mellowed it out a bit.  My dinner entree was the Cocojoe's Coconut Chicken Plate and it was delicious!  There were two huge, flattened pieces of chicken totally covered and crusted in coconut.  It was also slightly covered in a deliciously spicy and slightly sweet lilikoi sauce.  I loved it, but my husband loved it more, so I let him have it and I traded him.  Now I had the pork plate which was also delicious.  The pork was tender and the pineapple/soy bbq type sauce was addictive!  There were also chunks of pineapple which was a nice addition.  The coleslaw it came with was actually a great stand-alone side.  It had a tangy buttermilk base with just the right amount of pepper.  For dessert we got the key lime pie.  It was amazing.  It was so tangy, smooth, and creamy.  It was simply unbelievable, and unlike any key lime pie you have ever had.  I adore this place.  I'm truly in love.  I will be back here many many times.  I cannot wait till the weather is perfect for relaxing on the patio and sitting around the really cool firepit.  Obviously, I was impressed with this place.  The architecture and reuse of the building is wonderful.  The laid back/island atmosphere of this restaurant is a true winner that will be bringing in the people for a very long time.

We've driven by the PHX Over Easy many times but I refuse to wait for it.  I knew in my heart that it wasn't the same type of food worth waiting for like Matt's.  We decided to head way out to the apparently non-popular Over Easy to see what all the fuss was about.  To sum it up, just don't bother!  We walked inside and the place was only about 1/2 full so we grabbed a seat in the middle where there were three terribly placed tables.  My first impression was not a good one, as this restaurant is horribly under utilized and very poorly planned.  The color scheme was nice and cheerful though.  I really really hated the vinyl chairs that clung to my legs.  It was really uncomfortable.  After perusing the menu for a few moments I decided that the Wolf Pack was the way to go for me.  I like big manly breakfasts and this sounded perfect!  Two layers of hash browns with bacon and eggs cooked to order in the middle with cheese on top.  Yum!  That really sounded delicious to me, unfortunately it was a big heaping pile of FAIL slopped on a plate.  The bacon was about the only good part of my meal.  The cheese tasted like plastic, the eggs were rubbery, and the hash browns were so greasy that they slicked my lips with oil after every bite.  In the end, despite the fact that I only ate about 1/3 of my food, I got sick.  I was not a happy camper and I will never come back.

Somehow, the husband and I have managed to pass this place like a million times, never even noticing its presence.  This Saturday we decided to give it a go, arriving at about 10:55 to eat some breakfast.  Uh-Oh.  The menu says they don't serve breakfast after 11 and I was about to get really angry because of the lack of food in my belly but our server was super sweet and said breakfast wouldn't be a problem.  YAY!  We both ordered the breakfast bowls, and I got mine with bacon.  While waiting for our food, the husband and I made plenty of snide remarks about how this had to be better than the Two Hippies Crappy Breakfast Dumb.  Sure enough, it was soooooo much better.  First of all, our food wasn't served in environmentally unfriendly styrofoam.  Second, it was actually in a BOWL!  Imagine that!  I dug my fork in and got a nice helping of potatoes, cheesy goodness, fluffy egg, and delicious bacon.  The bite was simply wonderful.  The potatoes were super crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy inside.  There were not one, but TWO layers of ooey gooey cheese in that bowl, making an ordinary dish extraordinary.    Now, don't get me wrong... this is not the world's greatest breakfast, but it is pretty freakin good.  The service was friendly.  The food was fresh, non-greasy, and delicious.  My favorite part of all though, would have to be the no-nonsense diner attitude.  Give it a try!

I would give this "Urban Grocery" a better rating if their hours were better!  Being closed on Sunday and Monday, two of the most common "oops, I forgot something and need to go to the grocery store" days, is not the best idea.  It's great that this place is within walking distance of our home, but their stock just isn't that great.  I'm glad that I can get Hickman's eggs there, but I wish that they used Superstition Farm milk instead of the ubiquitous Shamrock.  SuperFarm's milk tastes better and lasts longer.  They have an interesting selection of produce, and I realize it's still growing, but we live in AZ so stuff like berries are not to be expected.  Bummer.  They carry some stuff that I will purchase every so now and then like the AZ Cheesecake Co. treats and the bread from Scottsdale, but that's about it.

I was only mildly impressed with this casino, and I'm not just saying that because it ate 40 of my dollars.  The outside looks great and I really really like how the freeway exit practically forces you into going there.  The drive up was pretty easy to figure out, unlike some other more confusing places.   I'm not sure how well they police the age limit, but I got ID'd as soon as I got within 10 feet of the doors.  That's fine, I get it, I'm only 23 after all.  The inside of the casino is rather impressive.  I kind of felt like I was in Vegas.  There seem to be more sights, sounds, and flashing lights in this casino in comparison to the others around the valley.  Unfortunately, their selection of games consists mostly of slots, slots, and more slots.  I hate slots.  We wandered around for a VERY long while trying to find some Video Poker or Keno.  We played some, got bored and decided to see what the non-smoking section was like.  It was TINY!  Literally, it could have only been about a 20 by 15 foot room.  Lame assortment of machines in there.  I wasn't really impressed, I lost money, and it felt exceptionally smokey in there.  I'll stick with Casino Arizona or wherever it is I normally go instead.

As we were sitting at the sleek white high bench table eating our yummy burgers, Glenn says to me "I think this is the best burger in the Valley."  I contemplated that for a little bit and he asked me if I agreed.  Well, I couldn't really come up with anything better.  We love the burgers at FEZ, and we've tried the burgers at Delux, I mean really, we've kind of tried everywhere that says they have great burgers.  So yeah, I have to agree that Modern Burger makes the best burgers in the valley, even if they are only 3 and a half inches in diameter.  I ordered a pair of the sliders along with a side of fries for sharing.  At roughly 6 bucks for 2 sliders, I was expecting some pretty great things, and man oh man did Modern Burger deliver!  The meat was ultra tender, full of yummy juiciness and cooked to the most perfect burger temperature.  The cheese was perfectly gooey, but not messy, and the sauce was just right.  The buns that these babies were served on were also delicious, not just a mere vessel for holding meat.  The fries were also delicious, sprinkled lightly with a large chunky sea salt that made them nearly irresistible.    Do I sound slightly obsessive?  Probably.  This may actually be the one special place that can get a Scottsdale loathing couple to venture out there more often, even if it is just for a meal.

After spending Halloween handing out candy with my parents in the East Valley we were super hungry on our way home, about 9:45.  I always get nervous going into places like this right before closing time because I used to work at Paradise Bakery, and I know what a pain it is to clean up after just one stupid sandwich.  These guys definitely didn't show any displeasure.  We were warmly greeted with nary an evil eye in sight.    The decor is super themed but cute.  I like the cheese thank you very much.  The employees are even in a sort of fire fighter uniform.  Their menu is diverse enough to make most people happy.  I was really hungry so I ordered the Firehouse Hero, a trio of roast beef, turkey, and honey ham.  The meats and cheese are steamed before hand to seal in extra juice and just make it really good.  Nice touch.  The bread was exactly the way I like it, sort of soft, sort of crusty.  The meats all tasted really great and were actually distinguishable from one another, unlike other certain sub shops.  The honey ham was my favorite, it was really sweet and really good.  I wouldn't mind if they brought one of these Downtown.  Good sandwiches for a good price.

I was terribly disappointed.  This place has nothing on Smeeks.  We weren't even acknowledged as we walked in the store despite it being mostly empty in there.  That was rude.  The candy selection pretty much sucks and none of it was anything I hadn't seen before.  Prices were fine I suppose, but this place just left me underwhelmed.  I don't do vinyl, so I can't say anything about that, and there were some shirts there too, but again, I came in for candy so I left empty handed.  Sadly, this place just reinforces my belief that Grand Avenue is full of businesses that just don't care.

Holy overpriced!  With everyone all abuzz about this place opening up in AZ, I figured we would have to give it a try sometime.  Well, we were out and about in the EV this weekend and figured now was as good as ever.  Things did not start off well.  First, the music was so LOUD!  Some poor old lady walked in and covered her ears the second the door opened.  I also hated the peanut shells.  It was stupid, poorly executed and had no business being in a fast food burger joint.  Steakhouse or BBQ place, maybe, but not here.  Apparently the ordering system is difficult because it took the 6 or so people in front of us forever to order, but for us smart folk, it takes about 30 seconds.  Now to the food.  It costs 4.89 for a single patty bacon cheeseburger.  I can get a Baconator combo at Wendy's for that price.  That's just the burger here, so for an extra 2.59 I can get frys (a generous portion at least) and another couple bucks gets me a drink.  I'm practically pushing a 10 dollar combo here!  This is fast food right?  I couldn't help but compare it to In'N'Out and this place was failing miserably!  Our food came out in roughly 5-8 minutes and we went outside to eat because the music was unbearably loud.  The frys were decent, nothing to special and I found the cajun fries to be very dry feeling in my mouth.  The burger was such a disappointment.  It was small and very smashed when I opened it.  The meat was very well done, and not juicy like they said it should be.  The bacon was decent and the cheese was well, cheese.  Overall, a pretty lame burger, especially for nearly 5 bucks!  Obviously, I was disappointed.  I know 5 bucks for a burger isn't a lot, but for fast food, it really is.  It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers, because this place is not good.  This place is definitely a fail for me, but at least my food was edible.

I was definitely not impressed with this place, and I'm even less pleased that we get this sub-par "grocery store" in the sure to be awesome CityScape.  After spending a summer in Washington, I think I was expecting this place to be like a pared down Thriftway.  I was expecting lots of gourmet items and other fun stuff.  Well, it's true they have lots of gourmet items, but it's pretty much limited to wine and olive oil with some cheese and already prepared foodstuffs in between.  The layout of the store was extremely frustrating.  Despite the store being large enough to theoretically hold 30 customers quite adequately, the layout created all sorts of traffic jams and line convergences.  It was really annoying to say the least.  We didn't buy anything because of what looked like a mile long line.  I do have to say though, that I was particularly interested in a jar of some gray sea salt.  That's about it.  Maybe another time.

A while back at Devoured, I watched Chef Payton completely butcher and reassemble a whole pig.  While slightly nauseating, it was entirely fascinating, and the entire time, Chef Payton shared his lovely sharp wit and narcissism with the audience.  I just had to see what this guy is all about and what makes him so confident.  Since we were heading out to the East Valley for some reason or another, we figured it would be a perfect time to grab lunch at Caffe Boa Bistro.  They seemed to be really short staffed at the time, so I gave the lapses in service a break.  That being said, our sodas were kept refilled and the kitchen even sent out a little extra food to tide us over until our meals arrived.  I ordered the Gnocchi Carbonara.  I have a weakness for gnocchi, so as soon as I saw a mention of it, I set my menu down and was ready to order.  I guess I didn't realize that I would have to specify that I wanted the half portion despite it being lunch, because I was served, and consequently charged, for the full portion ($16).  Oh well.  The gnocchi was absolutely delicious.  They were exactly what they were supposed to be, perfect little potato pillows that just melt away in your mouth.  The sauce was really great, but maybe a tad bit too heavy.  I know Carbonara is not a light sauce, but this could have been thinned out just a tad and then it would have been perfect.  I'm pretty sure they do a seasonal menu here, so I would like to come back in the summer time and see what delights Chef Payton has up his sleeve the next time.

I've never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  It's absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later.  We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in it's own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldn't help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin'.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.  The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I don't remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasn't ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I don't do dill pickles.  I definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well.  I have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite.

Four and a half stars, but only because I've been once and I wasn't COMPLETELY sold.  Don't get me wrong though, because Culinary Dropout is fantastic!  We chose a relatively odd time of day to grab some lunch, so it was fairly empty when we were seated.  Our waitress was nice enough, but a little stand-offish.  She did her job right, so that's all I really care about.  After I decided what I wanted I gazed about the restaurant, admiring the decor while our waitress made her way back.  We ordered the pretzel bread with cheese fondue to start and I got the grilled cheese sliders.  The pretzel bread was DELICIOUS, even without the cheese dip.  The cheese dip just threw the whole dish over the top amazing.  I really loved this stuff, but I had to stop eating it so I could actually make room for the grilled cheese.  This app is more expensive than the rest, but there is easily enough to feed 4 people.  My grilled cheese sliders were wonderful.  They were served on the adorable little mini slices that look like they were made for fairies, and I just loved that.  So dainty!  The cheese inside was ooey, gooey, and melty.  Just perfect.  Plus, there was bacon, so how can you go wrong.  I think fries came with it, but I can't remember.  I will definitely make my way back here at some point.  I hope Mr. Fox decides to bring one closer to Downtown Phoenix because that would be awesome!  In an area where everything feels so contrived and pretentious, Culinary Dropout was a welcome haven to relax and be yourself.

I just started a baking class and we were told that we needed to get a chef's coat.  I heard someone mention a place on 15th st and Mcdowell and figured it couldn't hurt to check it out.  I am so glad that I did.  This is THE place to go if you are a uniformed professional.  You can get firefighter stuff, security stuff, scrubs, and culinary stuff.  They have a wide variety of everything and their prices are VERY fair.  In terms of chef coats, if you are interested, they carry a lot of colors, many styles, and many brands.  You can find something for as low as 15 bucks!  You really can't beat that for high quality uniforms.  Keep this place in mind if you need a uniform for work...or play.

Ugh, these places are terrible.  I'm not really sure why the husband and I decided to give them another shot, maybe because they're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice, who knows.    We decided to go inside the restaurant this time to see what they were all about and it's just a little overwhelming and quite a bit claustrophobic.  There is so much going on in here, with a huge backlit menu above the registers, a good number of TV's blasting some basketball game, and the cacophony going on in the kitchen.  After about 10 minutes of trying to figure the menu out, we decide to order and then wait about another 10 minutes while the guy pushing the buttons figured out how to do a stupid cheeseburger with just mayo and ketchup.  We waited a little while for our food to come out and the same look of disappointment from my last experience spread across my face when I saw my burger.  I got an ill formed patty with ridiculously cripsy edges and haphazard construction.  I ate it and it really sucked.  At least I didn't get sick this time.  The only good things about this place are their fried cheese curds and some promising concrete flavors.  Aside from those two things, I will never eat anything else from here again.

It's nice to see a big place like Tempe Marketplace actually have a large number of dining options that are not the usual suspects.  Instead of Panda Express, we are blessed with Yum! Yum! China.  Their menu is nearly identical to Panda's with the predictable 2 or 3 item plate and their food offerings are all pretty similar too.  However, while they may share the same types of food, the tastes are actually vastly different.  In general, I think it is safe to say the food at YYC tastes fresher, like it was cooked more recently.  They also keep smaller portions on hand instead of the giant heaps of food you find at Panda.  Also, I have found that the weird "off" taste that usually accompanies Chinese food, like when you eat Beef and Broccoli and it leaves a film in your mouth, is not carried with YYC food.  If you go here, I definitely recommend the Orange Chicken.  It is so good.  They call it spicy, but it definitely isn't, instead it is more of a sweet heat thing with a lovely tangy orange sauce coating perfectly fried little rounds of chicken.  Possibly my favorite thing about this place is that actual Chinese people run it, and they are all very nice.  If I am eating "ethnic" food, I want that particular ethnicity to be running it.  I find it weird to be served Chinese food by Mexicans, but that's just me.  If you need a quick and tasty option at the Marketplace, you should stop by here.  If anything you can get a free sample outside the doors.

You know, I would probably rate this place at just 3 stars, but there is something about it that just made me kind of happy.  I was in a bad mood on the way over here because I was so hungry, and when I looked at their pretty average menu, I was still in a bad mood.  However, once the server came by, took our orders, and brought our drinks, my mood started to improve.    The cafe itself is pretty quaint, with an obvious aviation theme going on.  The view outside is lots of tarmac, but it's still nice to see a couple planes chillin' on the runway while you eat.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which is as straightforward as it seems.  Scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, and toast.  It also came with a side of hash browns.  The sandwich itself was actually really big!  The most surprising thing of all was that there was a lot of flavor packed inside there.  Usually, diners are fairly bland and easy on the seasoning.  My mood was way up by now.  Then some people walked in and I was entertained by the non-local people watching that I got to do.  The hash browns were also good, a bit peppery, but better than typical bland city.  I would come back here if we were all the way out here at breakfast time for some reason.  It was reasonably priced, the service was great, the good was good, and the atmosphere was lovely.

After our absolutely awful experience next door at the terrible Red Bird Cafe, we were famished.  We walked right in to Filiberto's, ordered a couple breakfast burrito's and a soda, were treated with a smile, and got our food all in a matter of 5 minutes.  Plus, we got it all for less than what we were about to spend next door.  I haven't had any form of Berto's in years.  I honestly can't remember the last time I ate at one.  Needless to say my first bite into my steak and egg burrito was so nice.  It was meaty, cheesy, and stuffed full of eggs.  It was the perfect foil to a cold, rainy, blustery day.  The only thing I wasn't diggin was the messy floor.  Oh well, the food was delicious and I got a Diet Coke.  I was a happy girl.

If you want the best non sit-down restaurant burger ever, then this is where you go.  I am absolutely head over heels in love with Smashburger.  I was completely smitten when I first visited the one in Tempe a while ago, but the long distance relationship was just too much.  Now that Smashburger is closer to my 'hood, we can see each other more often.    We went for their VIP grand opening, and everything went surprisingly well!  They were utterly jam-packed but the crowd was appeased with shake samples while we waited for our free food.  Of course it was delicious.  You can't go wrong with the BBQ Bacon burger.  We have since been quite a few times, and they are consistent with the first.  I always get a delicious burger that is cooked well but still incredibly juicy.  The bacon actually adds to the burger in both texture and flavor.  The haystack onions really set this burger apart from the rest though.  They add flavor, texture, and a perfect savory finish to every bite.  I love the veggie fries, especially when I get lots of asparagus.  The olive oil rosemary fries have actually gotten better since the opening.  I think they have lightened up on the OO, which is a good idea.  Smashburger is pretty tight with me, although my pants don't appreciate it.  We'll have to see where our relationship goes once Smashburger moves in less than a mile from my house.  I hope I don't get too clingy.

This is a pretty fun place later at night.  It's really busy inside and everyone seems to be having a great time.  I think they have a pretty nice setup in terms of bar placement and actual tables/booths to sit at.  Most of them are positioned so you can see whatever crazy person decides to try their hand at the mechanical bull.  I hear they have smores here and I am totally going to try them one of these days.

I wasn't feeling RnR at all!  We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us.  Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.    We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then.

It's really nice to have a decent Chinese food option Downtown at normal dinner hours.  We came during their grand opening and got like, half priced food, and then we have been another time for take out in the park.    Both times I have been pleased with my food.  The first time I got mushroom chicken, or something like that, and it was very good.  The sauce was thick but not gross and gelatinous, and quite savoury.  There were tons of mushrooms and plenty of chicken to go around.  I wasn't quite sure what was going on with the apples and strawberries on my plate, but I ate them anyway.  I also got an egg roll.  They are fantastic!  I really do love them, and their sweet and sour sauce they serve with it is also great.  The second time, I got the Beef Fried Rice.  It was really nice and not greasy at all.  There were lots of veggies in it, but I could have done with a little bit more meat and a little less onion.  Overall though, it was great.  I really do love this place.  It's quick and convenient, and the staff is super friendly.  My only complaint is that they have Pepsi products, and everyone knows that Pepsi is gross.  I also found it hilarious that on their grand opening day they were giving out plastic Coke "glasses".  Ironic.  Great place, you should go!

There are only two reasons why I am not giving The Vig the full 5 stars.  One: I need to try at least one more thing on the menu, and Two: I didn't get to play Bocce Ball.  I really did love this place though.  The re-use of the old bank is absolutely spectacular.  I can't say one bad thing about the design.  I especially love the greenery up by the front entrance.  The vertical display is awesome and I love the u-shaped garden as well.    On to the food.  It really is wonderful!  Plus, they have a killer happy hour so you can sample more things than you would at another time.  We decided to get some crab and artichoke dip as a starter.  It was phenomenal!  It was smooth and creamy, full of flavor, and packed full of yummy crab meat.  The most amazing part?  It only cost like 5 bucks on HH.  Impressive.  I noticed that the menu has a definite Indian/Asian feel to it, so it wasn't entirely my thing, but there were a lot of yummy choices available.  I went with the Turkey Sandwich.  It was packed full of turkey, with cole slaw, dill havarti, cranberry chutney, and honey mustard mayo all between pretzel bread.  It was HEAVENLY!  I loved it so much I saved half and ate the rest the next day for lunch.  The bread was delicious, the cranberry was perfect, and the dill havarti was an awesome twist.  I don't have a single complaint about that sandwich.  I actually can't wait to go back and sample more of their creative food.  I'm still trying to decide if I am more excited for the food or the Bocce though. :o)

I feel like I have been waiting forever for this gym to open and their doors FINALLY opened this past weekend.  This is definitely a state of the art facility.  Only the newest and best equipment is good enough for this gym.    Every cardio machine is equipped with its own personal television with cable.  There are weight machines for every muscle group you can think of.  The floors are heavenly to walk on, with plenty of cushion.  There are three large classrooms, 2 on the 2nd floor and one on the third.  The yoga room is nice and quiet, perfect for a serene workout.  One of the coolest things about this gym is the cardio cinema, where you can watch a newly released to DVD movie on the big screen while working out.  How sweet is that?  The locker rooms are also beautiful and well appointed.  The showers are private and the sauna is located right behind them.  This really is an amazing gym.  They don't call it Elite for nothing.  On top of everything already amazing about this place, you really can't bead the awesome 3rd story views you get while working out.

I really liked this place!  Walking inside to this sleek and beautifully appointed fast/casual restaurant is a stark contrast to the lack-luster strip mall complex that it calls home.  Clean white walls surround the modern chairs and deep benches with dark wood accents.  I love the splash of blue mosaic tiles up front as well.  Whoever designed the interior has a sweet sense of style.  The menu here is really no nonsense.  There's about 4 different types of ramen, an assortment of sides, and then there are multiple variations of Boba in the room adjacent.  I chose the Shoyu Ramen.  The broth was rich and savoury and provided a nice contrast to the simple noodles.  There were a couple large slices of pork in the soup, but I would have preferred more small chunks instead.  I liked that there were lots of bean sprouts in my ramen and it added a satisfying crunch.  I would definitely come here again when I want some Fancy Cup of Noodles without all the preservatives :o)  Don't get confused though, I say Cup of Noodles in loving jest, because really, it's ramen, but this is really good quality stuff.  Give it a try!

I am definitely going to miss this place now that we live in Seattle.  We seem to have a hard time finding non ultra-hippie healthy food dining options here.  Aside from that, this place is really quite good.    Basically, everything on this menu is healthy and good for you.  There are plenty of options for people with specific dietary restrictions such as vegetarian, vegan, and even gluten free.  So many items looked really good on the menu, and we had a really hard time narrowing it down and figuring out what to get.  We ended up splitting some mac and cheese and some chili as our appetizers, and then I got the chicken salad sandwich for my meal.    The mac and cheese was pretty good, and it had lots of confetti vegetables in it.  The only part I didn't really like about it was the bread crumb topping because it got kind of hard when it baked on instead of getting crispy.  The flavor of the rest of it was good though.  The chili was really really good.  Who needs meat in chili?  Not this girl!  It was loaded full of beans and covered in a rich and thick tomato sauce with a healthy dose of spice.  It would be absolutely perfect on those rare cold days in AZ.  My chicken salad sandwich was absolutely delicious!  It was fresh tasting and not heavy at all because they use yogurt dressing instead of mayo.  The grapes were a welcome addition.  My only complaint was that the chicken was a little bit dry.  The dressing did a good enough job compensating though.  This is definitely a place I would love to come again to try some of their other menu options.  Maybe next time I come back to visit.
