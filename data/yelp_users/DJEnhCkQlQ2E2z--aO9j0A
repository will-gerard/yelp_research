I was very impressed with Green.  I only came here because the people I worked with on a recent program had ridiculous food restrictions of the vegan variety.  I try to just cover my ears and not listen to them when they talk, because it's like listening to bubble boy.  Have we rebelled against our very nature?  Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The "mock" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.    They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.    I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.  5 Stars

I thought by day 3/4 in our Vegas trip I would be totally spent, but something about Ellis island infused me with all sorts of energy.  Maybe it was the gigantic turkey leg, maybe it was the raffle with tons of gifts, or maybe it was the free beer.  All I can say is, it WASN'T the hot dog eating contest... as cool as it was to watch, I felt physically ill and I wasn't even participating!  What Ellis Island may lack in the big strip pizazz, it makes up for in charm and guile.  Cheap, delicious food, karakoe, and a super friendly staff all make for a great experience.  We were fortunate enough to meet Mike who was running the event we attended, and he was a total boss.  We were totally taken care of, and even obliged in our ridiculous scavenger hunt requests.    I know that Vegas is known for good customer service, but I guess I just did not expect to be so warmly welcomed throughout my stay.  This event was just a great example of the kind of things I enjoy;  a backyard BBQ feel with a live band, great food, great friends, and a fantastic host.  I even won some money at the Blackjack table.  It doesn't get any better than this.    Turkey Leg! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=SICcD3aU6LmtyFMrWrAQKA

Sure you can see it from anywhere on the Strip, but is the Stratosphere really worth the trip?  I can only speak from a customer service standpoint as we did not stay in the hotel, but I was nothing but impressed by way we were treated in this hotel.  We were on a scavenger hunt as part of the Yelp Spring Break weekend, and one of our challenges was to get a picture in the elevator of the Stratosphere.  Belly's full of custard from Luv It, we decided it was worth a shot to ask if we could just get a picture in the elevator without actually going to the top.  What we thought would be a simple yes or no turned into a full blown tour of the upper tower of the Strat, with no stone left unturned.    The fact that one of their staff would take time out of their day to show us around was totally unexpected and gracious.  I would come and stay here simply because of the phenomenal customer service.  Hats off to you Stratosphere, you've won my heart.  5 Stars

I had a wonderful experience here for Netroots.  My room was spacious, had an elegant, modern look, had a ton of bath products, even a loofah!    The lobby area always had cold water for that scorching heat, and had 2 great bar areas.  All my service interactions were prompt and pleasant, and they even hooked me up with some band aids after I was done saving the world for the evening.   Great location, friendly staff, elegant interior- I would mosdef stay here again.    5 Stars.

Only in town for the evening on business, I hopped on the trusty ol' Yelp app to see what the locals were saying.   My ego was fragile and my belly empty, so I skipped the Yelp Talk and went right to the "nearby" button.   Imagine my surprise when a Pakistani / Indian / Afghani place popped up a mere mile from my hotel!  This restaurant sits inside the Zam-Zam World Market, and boasts a solid lineup of dishes from three countries, all at very reasonable prices.    I could write nothing about the food here and still give it 5 stars because of the service we got here.  Our server was genuinely excited for us to be there, and happy to recommend what he believed to be great dishes to match our relative tastes (mine being super spicy, and my companions being the opposite).  I love it when I get actual recommendations, not the typical, "everything is good."    When he learned I wanted something he would traditionally eat, and also super spicy, he easily sold me on the Goat Karahi with the chili naan.  Having never tried Goat, I was super excited.  My buddy went with the kabobs per his recommendation, with one being mild, and the other with a little spice.  Great recommendations all around.  We started with the samosas $1:50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#tno1avQ14jhuMNrXANswow), and they were executed perfectly, with a cilantro chili sauce that had a great kick.  5 Stars  Goat Karahi $10  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#bHaip3hWpni9l_SB9pB3pw  This was basically a short rib dish with garlic, onion, and lots of spice (your cumin, turmeric, red pepper blend being very pronounced).  It was fire hot, and the meat was like a pulled pork consistency, and almost creamy.  I wish I would have ordered regular naan, because every time I went for the naan to balance out the fire, I was met with thai chili on top of naan.  Needless to say I was smoking out my ears by the time I finished.  5 Stars  The kabobs were great, and with the Tandoor oven banging out quality naan, this was a meal I easily could have eaten when I was in the region.  Fantastic service, fair prices, and great tastes.  If I'm in Phoenix again, I'm here. 5 Stars.

One of the things that I value in a business is the level of personalized customer care that given to the consumer.  In each industry there are things a company or person can do to show they are paying attention to the details.   And in the field of photography, I find that the attention to details here lies in the level of relationship created between the photographer and the client.  McKenzi of Taylored Photo Memories did such a great job of making me feel comfortable and establishing a relationship that felt natural, like we were just hanging out while she took some pictures.  I think that what separates McKenzi from other photographers is the idea that relationship matters... that it's not about staging everything and having the whole shoot be regimented- it's about making your clients feel comfortable and natural so they can showcase who they truly are.    My pictures came out wonderfully, were turned around quickly and professionally (and with a face like mine, I can't imagine how much photoshopping she had to do).  and I couldn't be happier with the results.    5 Stars.

Surprisingly, Phoenix Sky boasts some pretty solid food options!  Running on empty after a long day of work, and finally heading back home, I was excited at the possibility of some Mexican food before my flight back to the OC.    Usually I would never order a quesdilla from a Mexican restaurant (the idea being anything I can easily make myself is out of the question), but upon looking at the menu, I was immediately sold.    Melted Oaxaca, Asadero & Manchego Cheeses on a Crisp Flour Tortilla with Machaca?!  $9 for an airport version of this was right up my alley.    The food came out fast, and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Solid.  4 Stars

Hand made, quick fire pizzas that can be customized with a respectable array of artisanal ingredients.     I had the TIROLESE with Brie' Cheese, Smoked Speck Alto Adige IGP.  This type of pizza is not my personal favorite, but what I do know is that it was cooked perfectly, and the ingredients used made it feel like I was sitting in a small village, eating cured meats and chesse from someone who had made it all themselves.  The fact that the owner was in the store cooking my pizza created that feeling of authenticity, that when paired with my italian wine (great choices from all over Italy on the menu), made it feel for just a moment like I was not in sizzling Phoenix.    To be transported away, if but only for a moment by the experience of eating food, is one of the greatest pleasures of dining, and Pomo Pizzeria gave me that experience.    A happy 4 stars.

Nothing special.  Long lines, expensive food (might as well just grab a nacho hat downstairs), and very few places that actually afford you a view of the field.    This is your spot if you want lots of craft beer choices, but other than that, I'd give this one a miss.

RAD.  Speakeasy concept, dimly lit and alluring, lots of different spaces to try out.  There are two main bar areas, one with a stage and one with lots of seats for the eating, and a gaming area with throwback arcade games and pinball.  You've got lots of options here!  I didn't get a chance to eat here, but I will if I come back.   It feels a little sketch to find this place, which is located in an alley- but if you can find it, it's a very solid choice for an evening.    4 stars.
