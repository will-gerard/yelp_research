I've been in this salon several times over the past couple of years.  If it weren't for a good friend stylist who worked there I'd never have given it a chance. But over all the staff members there and the manager for that matter are as rude,  pretentious and second rate as they come. My stylist is worth every penny but  the Salon is way pricey for it's local.  If it's the Aveda products your after (You have good taste) you''d be doing yourself a favor by driving the extra two miles  to Salon Tru or Scottsdale Fashion  Square.

Okay...here's the deal... We've had exotic birds in hour home for nearly 10 years now.  It's been a long hard road finding good quality people to help us with our birds. And finding knowledgeable people here in the valley has been no cake walk let me tell you.  I won't knock other stores here in this review but I will say it was such a great relief to have found Cage World in Mesa.  If you have birds in your home.. Big birds like ours. Umbrella Cockatoos you know what I'm talking about.   But if your new to the world of birds or are thinking about having a bird in your home let me tell you this...it's not an easy or hasty decision you want to make.    No question is to stupid dumb to ask.  Go ahead and ask the people at Cage World.  Don't pretend you know everything because you don't . After ten years I don't.  But the people at Cage World have always been friendly to me and helped me out with problems and decisions about what diets I should keep the birds on..  Vitamins, toys to buy...whatever you want to know.  They have always been there for me. I  love the store...the variety of toys. cages, foods..accessories.  So I thank heaven for Cage World they are a blessing to my bird family. And I am proud to give them a great Yelp Review.... Now I DO EXPECT A HEFTY DISCOUNT NEXT TIME I HIT THEM UP FOR SOME AVICAKES!!!

I cannot begin to say how much I loved my first trip to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles...  there was so much on the menu I can't wait for my next visit.  I totally recommend  it.  Love the ice tea!!! The Waffles melt in your mouth.  And the Chicken was soooooooooooo good!

Today, this company gets only two stars as I'm hungry and its 907 pm.  Info online says they close at 930.  However with the doors locked and me on the outside looking in still hungry.  They need to update their online information.    In going to Dwnny's they never close.

Frank and Lupe's is one of my new favorites in Old Town Scottsdale.  I highly recommend it...  They are open until ten every evening and have the best staff. I can't remember a place that had a more attentive group of people.   There are so many places to sit.. very intimate dining areas, a patio and at least three bars...   It's family owned and it shows that they are proud of their business.   Well worth the trip to Scottsdale Arizona... you will not regret it...This place is just great!

Okay...I've been there about 6 times... and, first through sixth times, each time was a step beneath  the previous visit. In my opinion they're slipping hard.  The staff is increasingly less and less aware that they are suppose to be attentive to the customers needs. Usually I weigh this adeptness of their job as a major part of the experience. Each time the staff has become more and more invisible.  The service is getting less attentive in a nut shell. The food selection I'm finding I don't care for as much as I'd remembered.  Seems they have a liking to sprinkle curry on most every dish I've tried. (*over done)  Best thing about Ticoz is the friends I'm usually dining with. Just not that thrilled about going back... to bad...

Each time I come across Ticoz...and invite or a lunch date.... I'm so left liking the place just a little bit less than the time before...   This time it was  the 2.00 charge for splitting my plate and sharing it with my lunch date... it's such a cheep way to charge someone for doing absolutely nothing...   I'm getting mad at this place!    Next time someone asks me to go to Ticoz... I just don't know what I'm going to say.

Xavier got it right... it's 5 star worthy for sure!  I can't wait for my next visit to this family owned, authentic Italian eatery! If you have never been to VinciTorio's in Tempe,  do yourself a favor and make a reservation right away.  This is by far my favorite restaurant here in Arizona. And I know a lot of places to go to have a nice meal... VinciTorio's is tops!   I'm ready to go again right now!

Okay...I don't think I'm over or understating the obvious... It's a Hamburger Joint.  But I'd have to say it's one of the best ones I've come across in a long while.  So to keep it short you couldn't do better than this place. If you know what you want. Odds are they've got it. If your looking for a Hamburger. But wait! There's more!  A great menu for such a tiny place. Dogs, Fries, Malts, Shakes, and a lot more.   The service was very polite and helpful.    I do recommend it.    Seating is a challenge...it's a small place. But the place has charm and most of all, just what you want in a Hamburger Joint.  See ya there!

On Saturday the 9th of January  2010 I visited Maizie's Cafe and Bistro for the second time. Each time we've gone out to this charming and very busy bistro the experience has been superb.  Our host Tina has welcomed us as if we've been friends for a very long time. I love that! And I'm looking forward to many more visits to Tina's place.  Both times the staple of our dining experience has been the Wingless Buffalo Dip.  It's a tangy cheesy dip made with Franks Hot Buffalo Sauce.  It was to die for.  Both times.  The burger was great. I do recommend the Spinach Artichoke Dip.Also one of my favorites.     Awesome menu! I'm looking forward to many more dining experiences here at Maizie's   Yo! Tina! See you soon!

While I did not run in this event... (officially) I was happy as a clam and just as wet (IT RAINED) to show up and support all the amazing runners.  And though I'm not really ready for my first Half Marathon just yet... I did manage to run a little towards the end...  I HAVE WITNESSES! Maybe soon I will enter...   But Congratulations to all the runners!

At first I was so impressed with this store and all its unique furnishings and accent pieces I wanted to keep it a secret and trick out our home with as many specialty pieces as possible. It really is that kind of a place.  But the service and sales assistance here was so pleasant I thought they deserved every compliment I could manage. It's now my go to place for so many things... Garden accents (I have my eye on a fountain statue),  many kinds of furnishings , home accent decor etc...  Thank you Lynn for making the experience at Global such a special one.   If anyone is in search for something for your garden or home. You should defenatly visit Global... It's quite the place!

Waited months for this store to open near my home.  I hope they fold. Over priced, free range, gluten free crap... I'll never shop here.  Give me a real neighborhood grocery store!
