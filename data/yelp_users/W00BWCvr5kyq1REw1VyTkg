First off, they had a signed picture of Young MC, which really started this place off on the right foot. I stopped in for a quick breakfast. I had an omelette, which was well priced for the size and the amount of vegetables and meat they used. The bread was lackluster for a deli. But the breakfast potatoes were great. A good place for a reasonable and quick breakfast.

The perfect place to spend an afternoon. Great patio. Fantastic local beer. Good food. All at the optimal price to quality ratio. For a sandwich, try the salmon blt.

Fantastic sandwich and casual dining place.   You know you've arrived somewhere special when the walls are lined with vintage psychedelic poster art from some of the biggest bands. That sets the tone for the menu:  great taste from a unique blend of flavors that come together in just the right way.   I highly recommend the wings with a 1/2 Prickly Pear sandwich with a specialty salad.

Great New Mexican style food. I have a hard time not ordering the Carne Adovada every time. However, the pork tenderloin and beef tenderloin are great choices. The atmosphere is a winner. Very little light with flickering candles to create a warm enjoyable dining experience. They get it right

Extremely underwhelming. Poor service. No knowledge of beers. But maybe you don't need knowledge when you have a descriptive menu.   Our food came out thirty minutes apart. My steak sandwich was more like a single slice of SteakUm on undercooked bread. Definitely not with the seventy five minute wait from order.   My wife asked multiple times for a beer sample and finally ended with a full beer. What was disappointing  is that for a place specializing in beer the draughts were too warm and a few of the beers were flat.   We did think the sausage platter was pretty good.   They did have a great selection of beer and seems like a fun place, but was disappointing.
