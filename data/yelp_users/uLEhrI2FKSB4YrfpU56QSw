Great salads, decent selection of beer on tap. Doug the Friday bartender is super fast and is definitely my favorite server in the valley. Nice place for friends to hangout.

I bought my truck there and it broke down in the first three days. The new battery they put in was the smallest and cheapest one they could find. Made for a small car like Chevy Aveo, not the 5.7 liter V8 I purchased from them. All of the electrical went out shortly after. They basically wash the car, degrease the engine, and slap a for sale sign on it. I would definitely not recommend being a customer.

A true classic in Glendale. The food is consistently excellent. You can't beat a place that serves beer by the liter.

READ ALL OF THE FINE PRINT BEFORE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION!!!!  I made the mistake of cancelling my membership before using all of my prepaid massages. Because of this I lost out on all of my massages that I ALREADY PAID FOR. 13 massages totaling $650. I can't have any of them unless I start paying a monthly membership. Right now I am in the process of joining a class action suit against this company.

We attended a movie there and the theater was very, very warm. To the point that my friends and I were perspiring.  I informed the manager just so he would know. Was not trying to get anything comped. The staff was already great. He called and thanked me for my input and offered me free movie vouchers. I tried to turn them down but he insisted. It is very good to see that Harkins still maintains an excellent level of customer service.

Bad overall customer service. Target is next door, better off going there to pick up games.

The joy we had bringing our daughter into this world was amplified by having Dr. Wareing see us through it. I can't recommend her enough.

Inefficient and my latte was all milk and what seemed like 1 shot of espresso. For a large that's entirely too little coffee. If you're looking to sit down and stay a while, this might be a good cafe to do so. If you are looking for a quick cup to go, you may want to look somewhere else.

Great selection of beer, a simple menu with options out of the ordinary, and excellent service.  Can't recommend this place enough.

I have only been here once but I am always trying to get my girlfriend to go back.The burgers are great, as are the sweet potato tots. The margarita was also delicious. I recommend the pretzel bun!

Terrible service. Will have to go to a better bar before attending any games.

Really disappointed with the overall quality. I was so excited that this place was so close.  Everything was gross.
