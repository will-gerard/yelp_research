for anyone who loves pin ball machines, this is a MUST visit place! They have hundreds of pin ball machines dating back from the 50s to modern day. Just make sure you bring lots of quarters or dollar bills.

My first impression upon walking into this buffet was, "gez, they need a remodel". I think the seating area in general looked a bit outdated compared to the other glamorous buffets around the strip.   At first glance, the food looked good! However, i wasn't too impressed when I started eating. I was not wowed as I would be when i tried other buffets like at the Cosmo, or even Paris. I would think that Wynn would try to compete with the bigger Casinos when it came to food, but apparently they might be competing with the likes of World Buffet.   Their dessert section was kind of embarrassing. I think hometown buffet has a bigger selection than these guys. They had the usual ice cream, cakes, and they had an eye appetizing Candy Apple. I was actually really excited to try the candy apple since it looked like it was the best thing that was being displayed on their dessert selection. I was curious as to why i didn't see one person reach for it, but I soon realised why. It was only made to be an eye pleaser... The candy shell was hard as a ROCK. It's impossible to bite through it, you literally have to take a knife, place the apple on the table, and smack it. And even then, the hard shell barely cracked. I can't believe that they put rock candy on their apple, it was completely inedible. For 3 minutes, i tried cracking the shell with my knife to get to the apple, but I failed. The only thing that I had from that dessert was the rock candy, which wasn't even that good.   Overall, not impressed with this $40 buffet. I'd rather go to circus circus and spend 20$ on their comparable buffet and spend the remainder of my money on alcohol.

I've never been to a Korean Spa before, but after visiting this place, I'm certain that I will be going more often. I came here on a random Thursday morning, and it wasn't busy at all. They have a bunch of sauna rooms. Some of the saunas are designed so that you can take a 10 minute nap and not feel overwhelmed with the heat. I also like that this place has a "chill" room to cool off after coming out of a sauna or a steam room.   I loved that they also served food there. I had their KRN beef ribs, and it tasted BOMB! Totally worth it. My friend and I stayed there for 6 hours, the longest we've ever stayed at a spa before. Granted, we did take a 2 hour nap in their nap room. My friend slept in the "yoga room"   I paid $10 on a groupon deal that allows me the use their facilities all day long. Worth every penny, and THEN some. If you were to go to ceasers palace for their facilities it would cost $40 bucks for the day pass (still worth it though). If you're in Vegas and trying to recover from a hang-over, check this place out, it'll do wonders.

One of the best buffets on the strip, hands down! Awesome selection of food, hip looking seating area, and delicious desserts. The buffet was kind of located in a random part of the casino upstairs away from everything. But it's all good because it helps you work up an appetite by making you walk there.

One of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my existence and I try it at an airport in Phoenix. Who would've known?! I can't pinpoint what it is exactly that makes these burgers so extraordinarily good. Maybe it's the extra melted cheese on my patty, or the super fresh veges that they add in. It also might be because I was as hungry as a pair of starving hyenas.   The buns were so puffy with a bit of a crunch to it. They must have made it fresh! If I find out that any of the food there is frozen or processed, I will instantly become a fan of processed frozen food. Yep.. THAT'S how good those burgers are.
