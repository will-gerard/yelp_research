Our experience at this bowling alley was mixed - the pizza and waitress were great, but the management had severe shortcomings.    Just as a background, our group loves experiencing new activities and new locations across the entire spectrum of international travel, fancy dining, stamina sports, down to bare down-to-earth deals. While we don't mind spending a few hundred dollars for a single meal, we do mind it when a vendor does not uphold their promise - it's the principle of the thing - otherwise, what's to stop vendors to perpetually bait and switch?   We made a reservation for 7 people at this bowling alley to make use of a coupon that promised unlimited bowling and unlimited pizza for $11.95. The fine-print stated that this price might vary by location. So when we made the reservation, we asked them if they would honor the $11.95 price, and they confirmed that they would. We called a second time to verify the price (since some on the group might have agreed to the outing based on the price), and once again, they reassured us that the price would hold. When we arrived for our game night, they reneged and said $15.11. We asked them to look in their appointment book and see who promised us the price on the phone. The person in charge that evening said that the initials in the appointment book were undecipherable, so that he couldn't tell which staff member promised us the price on the phone. We asked him if we could talk to a corporate number to see if they could give him the authority to honor the coupon. He gave us a number and allowed us to waste another 10 minutes only to find that the corporate office was closed (did he not know their hours?)   Long story short, they had baited us, we were counting on an evening of bowling and pizza, and ended up wasting 25 minutes talking to the person-in-charge and paid them $22 more than we had budgeted for, plus gave them additional revenue via the beers and milk-shakes that we ordered.   Among other disappointments, the men's restroom did not have paper towels at the beginning of our evening and the seating for the bowlers was sub-par - far worse than other alleys we've been to.

I've gone to Brakes Plus two times to have work done on my car. They are close to my office and the service I've received both times has been outstanding. The first time, my tail light was out and I needed a quick replacement bulb. They replaced my bulb for free, which was such a nice surprise. I went back to have my front brakes and rotors replaced. I was given a quote and decided to have the work done. An hour later, my work was completed and I was ready to go.   The staff at Brakes Plus was professional and treated me with respect. They did not try to rip me off or sell me "upgrades" to my brake service. As a female, this was truly appreciated. I will definitely go back for all my automotive repair needs.

I ate at this Streets of New York location tonight with two other people. We thoroughly enjoyed our 16" pizza, along with the free garlic bites and marinara sauce. The pizza was perfectly cooked, with a generous amount of toppings. The pizza sauce had a great flavor, with just the right amount of garlic. Our server was friendly and outgoing. She made us feel welcome and provided excellent service throughout the meal. I would definitely return to this Streets of New York location. Their plant-lined patio is a nice bonus as well.

I used a Living Social coupon for 2 people for high tea at Kimberly Ann's. Sounds like it should be a fun and enjoyable experience, right? Well, it turned out to be a lot of "work". We wanted to go to high tea in December, but they were completely booked. Ok - we were disappointed but we scheduled it for early January. Well, a week or so before the date we were to have high tea, they called and said they would be closed due to plumbing problems. Another disappointment but we rescheduled for later in the month. What made this difficult were all the "rules":  1. You need to call at least 24 hours in advance to make the reservation. 2. They require a Visa or Mastercard number to hold the reservation. No-show's who do not give 24 hours notice will be charged $25.00 plus tax. (Is this a doctor's office???) 3. You must mention any coupon over the phone or you will be charged the full price on the day of your reservation. 4. The coupon price does not include tax and gratuity. They suggest a gratuity of 18% - 25% of the original price of $25.00 per person. 5. CASH ONLY for the $10.00 "required" gratuity for the coupon plus tax of $2.63 per 2 people. If you do not bring cash, you will both be charged the full price of the high teas.  WOW! That's all I can say. While the food was terrific and the service was good, they also had an additional "rule" stating only one type of tea per table. What if one person wants decaf and the other wants caffeinated tea? Too bad!   As previously mentioned, there is a "funny" sign on one of the bathroom doors saying: "If you have to go #2, please do not use this restroom." They then direct you to another restroom away from diners. Weird but true! I wish I had taken a picture of the sign.  I'm a huge fan of high tea, but I won't go back to Kimberly Ann's. I would recommend the English Rose Tea Room in Carefree for an exceptional high tea experience. Check out their website: www.carefreetea.com Also, the Biltmore and the Phoenician Resorts have fantastic high tea as well, for a higher price than the English Rose.

Cantina Laredo is a huge, nicely decorated restaurant. This was my first time dining on a Sunday. My guest enjoyed the fact that the brunch options were served with a complementary mimosa or "Bloody Maria." He ordered the crab cakes which were served with eggs, potatoes, and a cinnamon fried tortilla bowl filled with fresh fruit. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal. I had the cheese enchiladas, which were amazing. The types of cheeses they used (not sure the names?) made these the best cheese enchiladas I've ever tasted. My entree was served with rice and pinto beans. My other guest enjoyed the carnitas, which was pork shanks served with rice and zucchini. We all enjoyed the chips and salsa. The salsas were unique. One was served warm and the other was served cold. They were both yummy. The desserts looked delicious but we were too full to partake in them.  We will definitely return to Cantina Laredo.

I love Christina's! It's a tiny family-run Mexican restaurant with delicious and affordable meals. The owner and his family are extremely friendly and always make me feel welcome. They can tailor menu items to be vegetarian and dairy-free, if desired, which is fantastic. I go here for lunch whenever I'm in the area.

Dr. Murbach is a fantastic avian vet! She is also a mobile vet, so that means I don't have to stress my birds out by putting them in the car and taking them to a vet clinic. Dr. Murbach healed my Amazon parrot when he was very ill. She is caring and spends extra time making the birds feel comfortable before she starts examining them. She also does bird grooming as well. Dr. Murbach will treat dogs and cats too.

I do not like this Subway because they get upset if you don't leave a tip. I typically don't leave a tip at a fast food restaurant. I feel tipping should be reserved for full service restaurants, unless I am receiving super exceptional service. To me, a typical Subway visit does not warrant a tip.

I had never tried Filipino food, but my friend recommended it, so I tagged along. Wow! This is amazing cuisine! The bakery items are delectable as well.  I tried the Pancit Melabon, which is a dish consisting of thick yellow egg noodles mixed with pork rinds (I had them hold the pork rinds, since I don't eat pork) and topped with shrimp and boiled eggs. It was served with puto, a delicious rice cake. The portion was huge and the flavors were wonderful. It was served with a plate of white rice and a generous portion of ramen-like noodles (I'm not sure what they are called). The price for this dish was only $7.99 and it was a huge portion.   My friends tried the binagoongang fish (milk fish) and barbequed pork and they both raved about their meals.  We were all tempted by the wonderful bakery display. I tried the butter pecan cookie, which is like a large Mexican wedding cookie (yum!) and my friends had the cannoli and the ube cheese roll, both of which were excellent. Next time I want to try the chocolate mousse tower, which looked rich and delicious.   The restaurant itself is nothing fancy. The food and the friendly service are the highlights, although I hear they have entertainment and karaoke on Friday nights.

I am on the Crust email list, but hadn't been in lately. I received an email about "fast" M-F lunch specials, which intrigued me because I'm always in a rush at lunch.  I had read the Yelp reviews about the slow service, so I was a bit worried about trying Crust again, but my curiosity won out, and I went there for lunch.  The restaurant was about half full when I arrived. I decided to sit at the bar, where I could watch the pizzas being cooked in the wood fired pizza oven.  I was waited on immediately and received impeccable service from the waiter. I tried the salad, slice, and drink lunch special for $6.95. The pizza was good bit the salad was truly amazing. Fresh greens, a good amount of olives, no onions (yea!), and ranch dressing. You had your choice of dressing and they also had a Cesar salad available as part of the lunch special. The iced tea was delicious as well.  I will definitely add Crust to my lunchtime repertoire.

The Dhaba is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service can be a bit slow at times.  I love the decor and the ambiance. It's a small restaurant but it's beautifully decorated. It's much nicer in the inside than it looks on the outside.  I read quite a few people complain about the prices. I've always thought their prices were a tad bit high, until this last visit, when I noticed on the dinner menu 3 "full meal experience" choices. I got the vegetarian version for $12. It came with a salad (delicious!), a generous helping of naan (their naan is incredible!), daal (lentil stew), rice, yogurt, and the main course, which was a garbanzo bean dish. The final course was rice pudding and chai tea. I was full and happy for $12! My boyfriend got the lamb and chicken option, which was $17, but still a good deal for the amount of food he got. We both thoroughly enjoyed the "full meal experience" and would order them again.   They also have a new rewards card for repeat customers, which is great.

I always go to Picazzo's for lunch when I am in Casa Grande for business. Why? The service is always terrific and they have delicious lunch specials. My go-to lunch is the slice of cheese pizza with the Ceasar salad. Everything is always fresh and delicious. The nice thing about the specials is that they come with iced tea. The prices for the lunch specials range from $7 - $11, depending on what you order. It's high quality food for the price. There aren't a lot of good restaurant choices in Casa Grande, so I am thrilled that Picazzo's has a location there.   Definitely sign up for their "Power Card" while you're there. It's good at many different restaurants in the Phoenix area and on certain days of the week, this Picazzo's location offers double points.

I just tried Tumbleweeds for lunch recently after reading the great reviews on Yelp. I travel to Wickenburg for business quite often and am always looking for healthy vegetarian-friendly fare. Tumbleweeds offers quite a few vegetarian options. They have lunch specials starting at $5.99, which is very affordable. I tried the soup, salad, and dessert "shot" special. The tomato soup was excellent, and I really enjoyed my peach cobbler dessert shot (served in a shot glass). The owner, greeter, and server were all very friendly and welcoming. I will definitely return to Tumbleweeds next time I'm in Wickenburg.

A few people mentioned in their reviews that this restaurant needs to work on getting the kinks out. Well, I went there last night and there is still a lot more work to be done. Granted, there was a large car show event going on in the shopping plaza where the restaurant is located, but since Daddy O's was one of the sponsors of the car show, they should have had their s*** together and hired some additional wait staff and kitchen staff (they could have hired temps for the evening) to make sure they were adequately staffed.  We were a large party and all of us ordered the All You Can Eat Fish Fry for $9.95. A friend of mine had gone the previous Friday night and had raved about the fish fry, so I was eager to try it. We sat down quite quickly and received our drinks in a timely manner. We waited almost 2 hours for our fish (asking the waitresses and manager several times when our food was going to arrive after it didn't arrive after 60 minutes). It never did arrive and we finally just got up and left. It was a very disappointing experience.  The manager was friendly and welcoming but did not seem to be helping the harried wait staff bring food to tables. Several people at other tables complained to the manager and his answer was, "We're doing the best we can." Maybe this bar & grill should just concentrate on being a bar/pool hall and not offer food. The atmosphere was pleasant but the lack of service was appalling.

I have been practicing yoga for 15 years, at studios all over the Valley. What keeps me coming back to Surya Yoga?  1. The caring owner and instructors who actually remember my name when I walk into the studio. 2. The variety of classes and times available. I like how the weeknight classes are at consistent times. 3. The location, which is conveniently located near Tatum and Union Hills. 4. The lack of pretensiousness at the studio. Everyone is welcome.  Keep up the good work, Lacey and staff!

I think the owners must take the Yelp reviews seriously, because I visited this new Carlos O'Briens location for dinner recently and had an excellent experience.  We were greeted right away in a friendly manner by the hostess at the front desk. She seated us and within 10 - 15 seconds, a friendly wait staff member brought chips and salsa to the table. The waitress greeted us about 20 seconds later and took our drink orders. Staff members worked together to keep our beverages filled. Several staff members offered more chips and salsa to us, but we declined, knowing that the entree portions are huge.  The combination plates were large and satisfying (especially the tacos). The shrimp fajita platter was huge and delicious. The menu is large enough to satisfy most everyone. They even have non-Mexican food items if you are in the mood for pub food.  The only complaints I would have was my rice was clumpy in spots. Also, while the tables were cleared off quickly, there was a bit of trash on the floor here and there throughout the restaurant.  This location is quite a bit noisier than the old Scottsdale/Bell Road location, but the noise wasn't overpowering. I will be back!
