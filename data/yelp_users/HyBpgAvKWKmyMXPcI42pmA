I have been to this BJ's a few times, and unfortunately, my experience has gotten worse each visit.  This last time was actually for my birthday.  We waited 20 minutes after being seated for our order to be taken, waited another 30 minutes with our food (had to request fruit and crackers for the little kids because they needed to eat SOMETHING while waiting for their meals), and when the food came, our salads came WITH our meal (with the exception of the 2 salads that were completely omitted), and a steak and a burger were prepared incorrectly.  The manager was nice in trying to rectify the situation by removing things from our bill and comping dessert, but the experience overall was a disappointment.

I absolutely LOVE being able to go to a restaurant with my family and not have to worry about anything they order being bad for them.  Even my toddler loves it.  Clean, fresh, and pure food...the kind our bodies were designed to eat.
