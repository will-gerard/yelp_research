I see there hasnt been a recent review of this place so today is the day. I think 4 stars is a wee bit generous and three is a bit low. This place is located in a strip mall around the corner from the Walgreens & Bank of America. Ample immediate parking. When you walk in you see a panel of mailboxes to rent on one side and a somewhat sparse selection of envelopes, mailers, and greeting cards on the There was a customer in front of me who was mailing care packages to her sons away at summer camp. That took quite a bit of time. The folks were going to pack & ship the boxes apparently. When it was my turn I had a 4 page fax to California (cover page is free), a bunch of family photos to a friend, and a special letter. It took several minutes to get everything sorted out but eventually the fax got sent and the letters got addressed and finished. The lady seemed to know what she was doing. The man seemed to be following her instructions. All in all i thought my stuff got handled and I left satisfied. The premises felt a little dirty and im not sure how selling East Indian jewelry works at a mailbox store.

What an amazing place! What a smorgasbord of all things outdoors!   The parking lots are spacious and have alot of tree coverage. There are lots of pretty boats to see outside as well as some ATVs. You wander inside and are confounded with 2 floors of clothes, guns and equipment.  There are mounts of every kind to inspire you. There is a shooting gallery for the kids, but the guns were a bit heavy for my small kids to hold. They felt about as heavy as real rifles. They have two large fish tanks  one in the fishing section (fresh water) (you can watch them feed the fish on Tuesdays & Saturday) and one in the restaurant area(salt water). There is a lovely stream that is stocked so you can enjoy the big trout swimming by. They have a bow range upstairs to try out all the goodies. Their gun prices are decent along with a good selection of accessories and ammo. Nice selection of all kinds of ladies clothes and shoes for every outdoor endeavor.   The restaurant & bar are pretty comfy and have a decent menu. They are open the same hours as the store The service there is decent. We have enjoyed the burgers and the cobb salad mostly. I ordered the shrimp scampi one time and the shrimps were dry.  The only complaint I can really put forward is the front store cashiers/employees. I've had fairly poor service each time I've come. The cashiers are grumpy, distracted, unhelpful and I've actually had a girl walk away from me while I was talking to her cuz she was off. Oops!  So take it or leave it. I'd love to let Bass Pro Shops know their cashiers are terrible! Hello?

I see no recent reviews from here.  I ordered a strawberry margarita which tasted decent. Then we ordered 3 kids meals; two mac& cheese and one cheese sliders. I ordered the ahi tuna burger with sweet potato fries. The fries taste pretty good, kinda skinny, come with spicy thousand island for dipping. The burger itself was very drippy but the patty itself was very dry and tasteless. I ate about half and when the waitress came by I told her and she said she would comp my meal.  I went to wash my hands and I noticed the soap dispenser was empty and the trashcan was full. My boys went to use the bathroom and he came back to tell me the toilet paper was empty in the mens bathroom. Hmmmm. Theres no excuse since its 4:30. Not during the lunch or dinner rush.  The staff were attentive and the restaurant was otherwise clean. Im not sure if I'll be back.

Well, how many 5 stars have I given to restaurants? Not many. I am very capricious about my 5th star. It takes A LOT for me to wield that 5th star.  I like Hopdoddy's A LOT! Lets face it, this isnt the place to eat 7 or even 5 nights a week. Its too expensive for that and really, its a treat. The burgers are delicious and the milkshakes are amazing! I dont even want to think about how many calories are in those puppies!  Anyway, lets get back to the beginning.  The location is easy to get to off Shea, the parking lot is decent, shared with Chipotle. You walk up and there is free lemon water right at the door so you can help yourself when you are stuck in line. The concept is a hostess gives you a table number while you wait in line to order. You order at the register but pay at the table with your waiter. Then they bring you your food. Maybe they want you to order more food/drinks at your table? No idea. The menu is pretty simple; burgers, fries, drinks. I did notice they do have a couple salad choices. I've never ordered one so I cant speak to that. Since stepping foot in this place the only thing I've ordered is the ahi burger. Omg. Heaven! Its a piece of ahi tuna seared on both sides & red in the middle with yummy stuff in between the buns! The other meat burgers look pretty tasty & juicy as well but I've not tried one of those either. The fries are very flavorful with several options for dipping. They are slim not fat fries but still satisfying. They have a full bar with clearly posted specials for wells & beers. But Ive not tried any of those either. I have the Nutella pretzel milkshake. To DIE for!! Dont bother to get one when you're on a diet. This shake is very rich, creamy, satisfying and tasty! Be wearing your fat pants here girls!! Lets just be honest. The place is very chill with a couple tv screens playing whatever sporting event is on. They have a happy hour from 3:30-6 and the service is very attentive. They have high tables and booths. They use highchairs that hang off the end of the table for the little ones. My kids are 8,7,5 and my little one sits better at a booth than sitting in the tall chairs. The bathroom is usually reasonably clean and we've used it alot. The sodas are all non-GMO so I feel a little better about letting my kids indulge. Once in a while anyway.  So, even tho the prices are def on the higher side for burgers, I feel it is well worth the value for an occasional treat. Others might say its expensive but good things can be. Dont say i didnt warn you about the milkshakes!!
