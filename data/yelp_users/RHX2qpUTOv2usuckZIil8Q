Though I rarely visit this place, I still find it the best place to fix your burger with your choice of condiments. Though the appetizers come in small doses, the onion rings are sweet and the zucchini are bite size. It has a nice open space.You can watch the current college game while waiting in line to place your order or find the best seating that you can watch it from afar.   [Some day, hope to see someone order the Retirement burger.]

I'm going out on a limb here and give this place a 4. Why? Because I think there pizza is very good, when they are not busy. Now, when they get busy the crust begins to be soggy in the center. However, I like their crust because it has a light, soft, fluff to it.  The price is a bit high but its better than Dominos and Pizza Hut, which I don't like either. I think the wings have improved yet not as satisfying. (I'm still looking for the best wings)  My favorite pizza is the Duners Supreme which has olives, pepperoni, sausage (crumbles), mushrooms, green peppers, white onions. OOOHHHH SOOO YUMMY!  The dining area is small but I think its all about the take-home. Its probably a good place to have lunch, though.  Since they don't deliver to the REZ, I would happily work for them and extend the service to the REZ. (That's if I needed a job. But I'm good for now)

I am not sure if I want to review this place or not. I mean, the other reviews made this place sound great. Was that during Happy Hour or something? I wasn't at all impressed with the restaurant decor. My sister Cher T and I came here because I was wanting Thai food and She heard that this place had good reviews.   The buffet looked skimpy and looked like it's been out for a while. We sat by the window that appeared to have a couple of bullet holes in them. I was facing east and noticed the pile of stuff in the corner and my first thought was that is a potential fire hazard. Our waiter was invisible during the entire meal, what should have been an hour was more like 2 hour lunch. I don't even think the waiter asked for our drinks, so we both had water.   I ordered Green Curry. Since I was in the mood to try something different. It tasted good, however the rice noodles were clumpy and stuck together. I had to cut into the noodles to eat it. The spring rolls Cher got were good along with that peanut sauce. I don't think I will return in the future. Sorry!

So far I have seen Twilight and Gran Tornino in this theatre. I love this theatre. It's huge... I did sit in the 3rd row from the screen, but let me tell you. It was still an awesome place to sit and enjoy the movie. The sound is great. I think the introduction done by the staff is a little funny, but it's informational.

Alright, Now this is a place I can really pile the toppings on my burger.  I like how you can pick and choose what you want. Instead of getting your ordinary hamburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mustard, etc... Personally, I think the 1/2 lb'er is not enough to satiate the stomach. Next time I will order the next one up. The list of shake combinations are a little overwhelming yet I'm considering ordering a different one every time I visit the place. I had my favorite Oreo Shake which was Yummy!

The best thing about this place are the seats and the openness of the theater is almost like walking into a mansion. ( not that I've ever been in a mansion before. wait... I take that back. Does the White house count as a mansion?)   Anyway, The staff are nice and friendly. The popcorn is good but I wish they served coke zero.

I never had been to Paradise Bakery before. I know, you must be thinking which rock I crawled out from. Seriously, I never really had the finances nor the resources to venture out into the "unknown". I thank my co-workers who have shown me the "unknown".  So, one day we decided to go to this Paradise Bakery that is tucked away in a corner next to a 5 & Diner and in the same building as a barber shop. Now, it doesn't seem all that inviting unless you know that it's there.   The first visit, I ordered a paradise club, which is really good. I'm a sucker for croissants. I stuck with that sandwich for a while then tried the tuna, the Thai chicken wrap, pasta salad, paradise Greek salad and their fruit salad. They are all very good. However, I'm not a fan of eating cold chicken but I guess you get used to it.  The pro's for this particular place is the food and service. However the cons are the customers. It gets a little pushy and crowded during lunch hour. Some are really impatient and they cross over your comfort zone. Then when it comes to the soda machine they hog the whole area making you and everyone else wait to fill their cups or get a lid and straw for your cup or whatever you are waiting to get. I understand its lunch time but still show some consideration to other customers as well.

Have you ever tried "Threading" before? Would you like a Henna tattoo?  Jada Beauty is the place to go.   "Threading" is like waxing or shaving but without the chemicals and razor burns. And the Henna tattoos are beautiful.   They offer eyebrows, lips, chin, sides, forehead, full face threading.  The staff is very friendly. The space at Desert Sky a little small but comfortable. I even heard you can design your own Henna. How fun would that be?  A few years ago, they used to be at AZ Mills. Then moved to a small shop on Mill ave. Now they have two locations : East Valley in Fiesta Mall and West Valley in Desert Sky Mall.  The prices to me seem reasonable. But this is the only place I have gone to get my eyebrows done. So only you can compare the pricings? But I have heard it can cost more at spas.  I recommend this place for a new experience.

Okay, So... I heard of "Jamba Juice" before but never had the privilege of trying the place out do  to there locations throughout the surrounding cities. Until one fine day, my co-worker brought some in for us to try. After that I was hooked.   So, as some of you will know that Avondale is growing pretty fast and I just happened to see in-between Quizno's and Panda Express is a "Jamba Juice".  I was excited. I'm not exactly sure how long they have been open.  The place is small, service is quick, staff is friendly. Sometimes slow during the week but on the weekend expect a small crowd.   YAY for Jamba Juice for putting there business close to home.
