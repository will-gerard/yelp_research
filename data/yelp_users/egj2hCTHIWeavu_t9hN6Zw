If I could rate this location more starts, I would. I always get exceptional service, and they employ so many young adults with special needs which is truly gratifying. I come Here about 3x a week and always get treated like family. Management definitely deserves major recognition.

I love this location. Best service I have ever gotten at a fast food Resturant. Been coming here for a few years and every time my service is just as good! Keep it up guys!!

Great acai bowls, incredibly slow service. Plan on waiting at lease 20 minutes for a bowl or smoothie.

I LOVE paradise bakery, however this location has the worst service I have ever seen. Been coming here for a year, and they are still so incredibly slow. I drive 5 miles out of the way because this location is SO SLOW
