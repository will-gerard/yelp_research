**2.5 Stars**  I really can't give this just 1 or 2 stars primarily  because yes it is a bar, and the drinks were quite tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my coconut strawberry mojhito, my dirty dirty vodka martini and all of the shots we went through. HOWEVER, the atmosphere of this place is pretty much a zero. It's trying way to hard to be some chic LA bar with ropes and red carpets, but it hardly lives up to any of they hype. Full of lots of cheesy guys with way to much hair gel and questionably tight shirts just prowling around for the way to tan, bleach blonde girls with boob jobs that go along with them. Not my scene, and I won't ever be returning for another visit.

Admittedly, two of these stars are for the $1 dollar mimosas that we drank several carafes of.  I mean pretty much the deal of the century- $1 Mimosas, PBR and Bloody's...not only for brunch, but also apparently on Sunday nights. The food was solid, but not amazing- we sampled the the burgers (yum) and the buttermilk fried chicken caesar- (pretty tasty). The fries here are also quite delicious- thin, crisp and just the right amount of salt. Service was not only prompt and friendly, but it was damn good lookin :) I think this spot is definitely underrated and worth checking out for a lazy Saturday brunch.
