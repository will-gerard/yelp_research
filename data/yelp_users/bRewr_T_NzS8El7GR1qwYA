I am a  first timer at T-Cooks and WOW! the food was great! We started off with the tar tar..then had a vegetable  salad that was tossed in lemon juice and olive oil. All of the veggies where left in big pieces that were perfectly placed on the plate! Had the  steak for the main entree and was very pleased! Only complaint is that the table we were at was right under a forceful air vent. I even noticed other people moving seats because of the vents..

I absolutely love positno! Has a very nice Ambience & Service is always great.  Great spot for a date or girls night out! Such a nice selection of wines. The only downside to this place would be that they don't have many options or dairy free or gluten free! Other than that it's a great place to sit and grab a glass of wine!

I come here for the Teppan-cook tables! It's always delicious! This place is packed on the weekends! Sometimes the wait will be a little crazy. Good food & Service is great.

This is my favorite RA. The best time to go is for the lunch specials or happy hour! Otherwise I feel that it can be a bit pricey! On Tuesdays they have the by one get one lunch special if you are apart of the "hooked up" email list. My favorite lunch special is the salmon bento box! Service is usually pretty good! Chill atmosphere.

Amazing homemade Italian food! Start out with the fried mushrooms or zucchini! I always order the house salad and angel hair pasta with spicy marinara with mushrooms and peppers! Or the minestrone soup is good too! This place is very quaint!

The bread here is amazing! Everything is always fresh. Portions are good sizes too! I always get the dilly bird add jalape√±os! SO GOOD. If you are looking for a place that is fast and close to campus. Do yourself a favor and go here.

Nice place for a dinner date or party. Food is great! Has a nice patio too! Only complaint, is the female bartender ignored me for 10 minutes as I stood waiting to order a glass of wine. (She looked at me a couple times) then finally another employee came over to take my order.

Food here is always good. Pad Thai with tofu and veggies is the way to go! I like that you can modify food items due to allergies ect!

Love boulders! Has a very quaint and chill vibe. They also have a TON of beers to choose from! I always try to try something new when I come here. They have great guacamole that they make fresh! Also, I really like the burgers.

Very unique vibe! Bar/tv's with Asian food. College kids working here didn't seem to know much...& Service was just OK. Food was great! And I came here to EAT which is why I gave 4 stars!

Pita Jungle is always delicious! This location is my favorite that I have visited. Very friendly staff and a giant patio! Our waitress Morgen was friendly and did an excellent job, considering how busy it was. Of course, we will be back!

First of all Try the Nutella crepe!!! The BLT crepe is great too! The owners are very kind. The only disadvantage to coming here is the service is very slow. Sometimes you will be waiting for someone to come great you for about 10 minutes.

I've been going to Ryan for about 7 months and I'm always very happy with his work. He's very nice, talented, and always makes me laugh! I referred 2 close friends of mine to Ryan, both of them absolutely love him, and became regular clients. As I cannot speak for any of the other stylist at ISH, I CAN tell you the staff has always been very nice and professional. Being relatively new to the area, I'm so happy to have found Ryan when I did, he's a pleasure to be around! Thank you :)

I love pet club! It's a small and quaint pet store. Staff is always very helpful! I like that they give info on adoptions and immunizations as well!

Food here is  mediocre! Some healthy options & close to campus. I like that they have vegetarian options. I feel that the Employee's at the Tempe location need to be trained on ingredients and allergy information! They seem to be pretty clueless! Also went to the drive thru at 3:30 (they close at 4) and the guy at the drive thru said to me "you are lucky that you didn't come any later or I would be pissed" RUDE!?? As far as I am concerned you are open until 4pm. So you work until 4pm.

Sprouts is the perfect place to get groceries. They have a large produce selection. Also, they have healthy prepared meals for when you are on the go!

I wish they had more locations! Excellent sushi, great prices and quality is consistent. Great ambiance, very modern and clean. They also have a great happy hour (Sundays happy hour is ALL DAY!??). The only complaint I have is that they need to work on their "greeting" of customers. Get the friendly vibe goin

This place is just "okay" I am willing to give it another try once they have been open for a  few months. I felt like they were a little unorganized. They keep the creamer behind the bar? I tried the iced tottie and it literally tasted like they added lime juice! Gross! Again, not trying to be negative nancy.. but this place needs some work!

I LOVE this place! Super healthy and reasonably priced. I used to go to the ones in Cali and im so happy they opened stores in phx! They have A friendly and helpful staff. Always quick. The greenie (green juice) add cayenne pepper is my absolute favorite! Also the bowls are awesome and really feeling! Favorite bowl is the PB Bowl! They have grab and go drinks & snacks as well! This place is a must try!

Well, all I can really say is that this place has plenty of room for improvement. Went for happy hour and it was Ridiculously overpriced coupled with subpar food. Ordered the green chili hummus and it was SO salty I could not even eat it. Also, ordered the salmon cakes that were $10 (happy hour mind you) came out the size of a half dollar... What a joke. One perk was that our server was nice and friendly. I doubt I will ever go back.
