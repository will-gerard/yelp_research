Let's start with this; my waiter was a 30 year old guy with eyeliner caked on. Okay... that's it, you can find a better place to have a drink.

Top notch. This place doesn't fall into the standard trappings of a strip club. Breakin' it down like a fraction: -Bona Fide Hotties (no buttahfaces or methies) -Lap dances are worth it -Not seedy, you could bring your girl along, she'll have a good time  Why not 5 stars? Because I wouldn't call most of the girls friendly or fun to talk to. They are mostly 'vets' that mostly just ask for a dance (money) and move on.

Personally, I am against jewelry of any kind, but my wife feels differently. So, I went on a search for a good value on an engagement ring. If you are serious about buying an expensive piece of jewelry, it pays to shop around, even online.  This place has a great selection of all kinds of jewelry. I was caught up just walking around to see the range of stuff they had. The owner, just for fun, showed me some very expensive naturally colored diamonds they keep in the back.  I shopped around big time, and got a great deal on an engagement ring. My wife looks at her emerald cut diamond everyday and enjoys it more than I can understand. It may seem ridiculous, but save yourself the headache, impress her, don't skimp on the diamond.

I shuffled my feet for years on buying a wedding band. Recently, I went in with my wife and we looked around for awhile and stumbled upon a stunning ruby and diamond ring. Had another great experience getting my wife something special.

You may feel suspect of this place in this run down strip mall, however this laser tag is a riot. The arena is well designed, gigantic, and multi-level. I went there with a big company group and had a heckuva time. They have an arcade with that tickets for junk and some crappy snacks. Not much else to say, but if you want a crazy game of laser tag, with many bases and different styles of play, this is the place to be.

There is nothing bad about Macaroni Grill, if you have a large group and can't decide on a place it can actually be alright. I just don't have much faith in Italian chains in general. I've gone there with a group 6-8 times and was there just recently and I can't recall anything I've ate. I have negative aspiration to return.

I've been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed. This is a step up from the Olive Garden and is well worth the trip. I've had the pecan-crusted trout there, which is excellent. The chicken fetuccini alfredo is definitely above average. Pork chops are well seasoned and quality.  Good italian that's not too pricey, you really can't go wrong here.

A huge selection of designer jeans for half price and if you catch a sale, even more. I've bought a few 7 jeans for me and Joe's jeans for my wife here. I really can't stress this enough, if you want to buy a pair of designer jeans, go here first and save yourself $100+ dollars.

I imagine this was your standard eatery before the fast food burger revolution of the 60s. Hot Dogs are definitely under served in the valley, because every time I go to Ted's or Costco I have to wait in a line. If you have a hankering for a dog and a pile of greasy fries you will like it. I seem to side with most of the other reviewers, this place doesn't blow my mind, just a solid choice.

Almost the size of a Wal-Mart supercenter, 5-bars-in-one, 80s, country, rap, rock, karoake themed sections. I saw William Hung there one time a wet t-shirt contest another time. When I was single this place could do nothing but bring a smile and a laugh.

The Casino is small and seedy. The kinda coyote ugly themed bar is nothing but plain and stupid. It's probably no surprise that Hooters Casino is awful. Have some dignity my friend, don't stay here and don't stop by.

The quintissential downtown scottsdale club. As snobby as it gets, but in an endearing way. I talked to Ice T and Coco at this club one time. For some reason I felt like I always was on the verge of punching somebody when I was in there. This place reminds me of the club in the beginning of American Psycho, reserved tables, the whole deal.

I'll preface by saying whether you're going to Meineke or to your ridiculously overpriced local dealer I believe most mechanic managers/owners are the scum of the earth. It's amazing what will happen if you go to a few different places to get an estimate to fix your car and what they'll say needs fixed and the ranges in cost involved.  I was referred by a work friend and I don't trust my vehicle with anyone else. The service is good, prices are reasonable, and they are quick in getting the job done and done right.

The name of the place is a bit of a misnomer, don't go if you are looking for a good martini.  However, probably my favorite downtown Scottsdale club. Large open areas, decent bands on stage, and a club dance floor. Girls are quality but somewhat atypical of the Scottsdale fake standard.

The worst steak I've ever had. I had a $75 Kobe beef steak that had a stick of butter melted over the top. WTF!? What kind of restaraunt would do that to a steak?   I also burned my hand on the steak plate that comes from the oven. I'm all for a hot plate, but giving a customer a plate capable of a 3rd degree burn, is that really necessary?!

Mandarin Heffeweissen and Thai pizza keep me coming back and also the fact that its just down the street from me. I recently went back because I heard they finally fired the two worst waitresses in the world. The food is inconsistent, but they have a fantastic revolving beer selection with many import beers on tap.  On a fun side note; My wife won a signed copy of a Ween (the greatest band of all time) live concert DVD by Gene and Dean Ween there on my birthday.

1. Beers on tap are European and good: Newcastle, Carlsberg, Guinness etc. 2. Above average to really tasty bar food. 3. A nice quiet place to hang out and talk. 4. Downside, not a good place to watch sports, small poorly positioned televisions.

On a lighter note I have to give it up for my favorite fast food. This is as cheap as food gets, but I love it, and probably have ate here once a week for the past 15 years. When I was unemployed I literally survived on bean burritos, soft tacos, and hot sauce.  I believe If every country had a decent method of distribution, Taco Bell would solve world hunger.  As far as this location its open late, built for drive thru, and looks old school.

I went there once because a friend of a friend works there. If you want to get a bunch of glitter and a heavy layer of cocoa butter on you, then get a lap dance from one of these bitties. If you so much as try to lift your arm to scratch your nose while a stripper is close to, you will be told you've broken some sort of rule. This place is the polar opposite of fun.

Fun fun fun.. Truly unique dishes and appetizers with an amazing selection of wines/beers for your dinner next door at AZ Wine. It's a hole in the wall but somehow comes across as chic and cave-like. Talk to your significant other and suggest a date night, you will look smart and trendy for picking this place.

I love to see a concert here. It's pretty intimate for a general admission place, you can go up to the front and get up close to the rock stars. I've seen a lot of metal bands here, Static X, Type O Negative, BuckCherry, Nonpoint, and Ween. I'm still ticked at myself for not going to see NIN and Alice in Chains there.  If you like to go to a concert and actually move around and get into the music, it's really fun. If you like have your own seat and just clap at the end of each song then you should head to Dodge Theater.  On a cool side note, I met my wife for the first time there.

This bar transport from Iowa City is all over the valley, but unlike the Iowa version I feel it has no redeeming qualities. Bad food and funny tasting tap brews. Girlfriend's fake ID got stolen there, man, having a girlfriend under the drinking age sucks, I'm glad that's over.

If you are going to Vegas, don't gamble seriously on the strip. It's stressful and has the worst odds. This is a huge multi-level casino, it's not the place to be seen, it's the place to gamble with friends. Sam's Town staff and dealers will happily help you with any game you want to play. The people who go there to gamble aren't loud high strung a-holes often found on the strip. For chill and enjoyable card games and craps, I'm a big fan of this place.

The best mexican I've ever had, hands down. I've been to all the hyped places; Z'Tejas, Chevy's, Gardunos, Macayos, Tia Rosas, Carlsbad Tavern, Blue Adobe, Arribas, Salty Senoria (horrible), Pink Taco (deplorable). The food here is as quality as I've had with mexican.   I find many mexican places give you little taste with a heavy supply of starch and cheese. Their Carnitas and Lamb Chop are slow roasted and bursting with flavor. Margarita and salsa selection leaves a little to be desired, but this place is a can't miss. Save room for dessert, because the Mexican chocolate cream pie is simply amazing.  Alright I'm cutting back to 4 stars, the plates are great, but the margaritas could be better, and the chips and salsa leaves something to be desired.

Most of the dancer/entertainers there are very hot 9/10s. If they are below your standards in the looks department, check your wallet ID, you might be Tom Brady or John Mayer. Most were pretty friendly and easy going, but they are world class hustlers, so keep your guard up to some degree.  I went there on a busy weekend on a Saturday night for a few hours and we did manage to find a seat after 20 minutes of searching. It was loud and not a relaxing atmosphere. I had a pretty good time though.

I can't believe the Yelp ranking for Luxor. Sure, this place is not as posh as a lot of the other places on the strip: Wynn, Paris, NYNY, Caesar's, Palms. However it's a big notch better than these places: Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, Excalibur, TI. It has a quality sportsbook, pool, and nightclub (LAX). Your room is in a pyramid, which is cool for novelty's sake. If you don't want to go spendy on a room, but want a decent place at a good location, this is my #1 hotel value pick on the Vegas strip.

I don't normally enjoy high end steak, but I went along for a bachelor party. I generally think steak restaurants are wildly overpriced. This is still overpriced, but the quality of cuts will make it seem worth it. The side dishes are fantastic, the drinks are also prepared to perfection. I had the 2lb porterhouse and took a high pleasure in devouring it all. If you have a bunch of money to spend on dinner and want a steak, I don't see how you could not be satisfied here.

I'm sorry I just don't get it. This place is huge and always packed. My in-laws always want to go, so I've been there a bunch. I feel excited to go inside when I get there because it has a cool atmosphere of this semi-old world, pueblo restaurant. Other than that, I think it's barely decent Mexican food and cocktails.

If you enjoy hiking with a beautiful view of the city, you must make the short trek on each side of the mountain (Cholla and Echo) at least once. A warning though, this is not for non-active, non-adventurous people. if you are not prepared to go up some boulders and use your hands, this can be dangerous for your ankles. The mountain is a beautiful city landmark, with a 360 degree view at the top.   However, this place will not get a pass from me, because the city really needs to figure out the parking situation. I understand you don't want too many hikers on the mountain at the same time, but this has about 1/3rd of the parking that would be optimal. On the Echo trailhead I waited for 45 minutes twice on a weekend just to park and didn't return after that. The Cholla side has parking that is a 15 minute walk from the trailhead and you may also have to wait for parking as well on that side.

If you are a fan of pinball machines on any level and you are in Vegas, take a break from the strip, and take a $5 cab ride here. You will smile like a kid again walking through this place and admiring all the 100+ machines. A fantastic way to spend a few hours in Vegas. They had all my favorites: Fun House, Adams Family, Bride of Pinbot, Medieval Madness. I salute the owners of this place, it's a truly amazing collection of fully playable pinball.

After a day of flashing lights, smoke, gambling, and drinking I lumbered into the Rio Seafood Buffet.  Like a lot of red-blooded Americans I enjoy an occasional gorgefest. I loaded up 3 thick-sliced ribeye steaks and 3 giant stacked platefuls of crab legs. During that hour of my life, I was in a beautiful trance-like euphoria.  I walked out refueled and refreshed and was ready for a fun Vegas night.

No flavor chicken fingers. The fries are kinda Ore-Ida busch league. I'm not into carb gorging, so I didn't eat the texas toast. Here's what really got my goat, only 2 sauces! You heard me right, just honey mustard and gross 'Cane's Special Sauce' (and they charge extra for them). How in the flying f#%&* do you open up 'Chicken Finger' franchises and NOT have Ranch, BBQ, or hot sauce?!?! That has to be the most moronic, piss-poor decision in the history of American fast food.

There's some sort of cupcake craze going on in the valley which I don't understand. What can I say about LuLu's? This place isn't really worth me writing about it, it's crap.  I spent $4 on a cupcake that was small, dry, and had some crappy whipped frosting piled on. I have this good idea to make their cupcakes actually edible: 'Betty Crocker'.

I went during the Iowa Football Homecoming game against Penn St. and the place was loaded with Iowa fans, in their hawk gear, into the game, and cheering on the team. I had $2 Bud Light bottles and $5 for a dozen wings and $5 plate of nachos. It's a hip place, spacious, and good atmosphere. I had a fun time for a good price.  I probably enjoyed this place a little more than your average guy, since I'm a University of Iowa alum, and this is an official Hawkeye bar.

This gigantic club has 8 separate areas including VIP upstairs lounge. Hot half naked girls dancing to club music. This may sound like a great time, but don't be fooled it's going to be really lame. My only excuse for going is a friend would get me in for free.  I would actually recommend it, if you are from out of town and have never been to a high end large dance club.

I have been to a few Vegas night clubs and thought they were pretty worthless, small, and lame: Jet, Christian Audiger, Risque.  However, Moon was the greatest nightclub I've ever been to. It's on the top 2 floors of the Palms. More ladies than dudes, amazing views from an outside lounge area, huge dance floor, multiple levels.  I went for my friend's bachelor party and we all had a great time.

A straightforward breakfast restaurant executed very well. Menu is everything you would expect, they do have some 'Arizona Mexican' options such as Sonoran Burrito and Green Chili and Chorizo Omelette. Pancakes are deliciousness, I really like the protein and blueberry. Sometimes when I go I want an espresso drink, but they only have coffee. I've been here a bunch, and definitely prefer it over chain places like IHOP, Denny's, Village Inn, etc.

If you are looking for a place just to be seen don't come here, go to Ra Sushi. This restaurant is slightly disconnected from "the Scottsdale scene" but this is some good sushi and sake. I'm the type of guy who gets the craving for sushi about once a month and I when I do I almost always go here. The service is great, the sushi is fresh, and the deluxe rolls are really worth it.

I got married here at the rooftop of this renovated hotel and it was an unbelievable experience. I'll preface my review by saying that I'm extremely fortunate that my in-laws paid for our wedding (this place isn't cheap). The 360 degree view of the valley and Camelback Mountain on the roof was perfect for an Arizona wedding. Our reception was right downstairs. The wedding dinner prepared was lobster and seafood pasta and prime rib, and it was by far the best food served at a wedding that I've ever had. We had open bar at the wedding and the drinks were not watered down and well prepared. The rooms are a little too contemporary for my taste, but the suite we stayed in was cool.   Aside from our wedding, I'll add a couple of notes. The pool is some good fun and was filled with pretty folks. Cafe ZuZu in the hotel is okay, but not worth the price. If you are coming from out of town and you are young and heading to the Scottsdale clubs this is a premier place.

Silver Pony is the epitome of your local country bar, but the crowd doesn't feel that 'country' per se, like the ones at Cave Creek. I really enjoy the band that plays there called Urban Country. The lead singer has an amazing voice that will immediately put you in a good mood. Prices are reasonable, we usually grab a pitcher and shoot a game a pool. They also have an Extreme Hunting arcade shooter. If you are looking to check out some hot cowgirls here, you will likely be disappointed by the selection. Perhaps a little seedy for some people's taste, but it's some good fun.

Great selection of wine at a good price. They also have an okay selection of boutique beers in the back. The reason I gave this place 5 stars is I love the little bar they have. The beers on tap are rare craft beers that I have NEVER seen on tap. 120 Minute IPA by Dogfish Head (19% alcohol), Sierra Nevada's Estate, and Deschutes Hop in the Dark to name a few. They also have rotating wine flights of all kinds. Just a cool little place to bring the lady, have a drink, engage conversation.

Mutliple simultaneous tournaments, many single tables. Room is really big and decorated with poker star posters (why don't they sign them? they all visit). Many televisions and giant wall tv projections with sports. This place is great, I just relaxed and played a $75 hold'em tournament for a few hours. I'll definitely go again when I'm back in Vegas.

This place consummated with the Golden Goose being featured on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. It's overrated. If you think this place is worth standing in line and waiting for your food for an hour on the weekend, then you easily fall for hype. The inside is really small and couldn't be any louder, it also has scattered outside picnic tables. After you order you get to wait in another line to get a drink on a single fountain area. The food is above average. I think the salads are borderline bad. I realize it's all organic and local, I've been to plenty of places like that, and most of them are far better.

These reviews seem to be a mix of the Cafe and Coffee Bar, my review is specifically for the Coffee Bar.  The bar is in front of Nordstrom in the mail and is a rip-off of Starbucks, but a marked improvement. Starbucks coffee/espresso has an acidic and burnt flavor. Nordstrom's coffee is smooth and roasty. This is a popular place, the time from the entering the line and receiving your drink is usually 8-10 minutes.  If I'm in any sort of mood for coffee, I can't help but stop.

This place is always busy. I don't get it.  The burger is plain. The fries are plain. No pizazz, no spice, no unique flavors, nada.  Eating here is the theoretical equivalent of going to a Dairy Queen where the only thing on the menu is a vanilla cone.

This 'company' serves burritos, cheap tortilla chips, with a butt-kickin' salsa bar. This is a lunch place in a low rent strip mall. I would only give this place 3 stars but their breakfast burritos are killer. Regardless of the time of day I usually get the chorizo, potato, and huevos burrito.

I really only give the burgers in this joint 3 or 4 stars, but the other items on the menu, make this place amazing. Such as:  #1 Tots.  #2 'Breakfast Bistro' sandwich. You CAN'T get a better fast food breakfast sandwich.  A large, super-soft bun, egg, meat, and cheese. Once you have it, your mouth will water every day you drive by Sonic in the morning.  #3 Quality commercials. The guy who wanted the 'last word' on his wife. You want some fries with that shake? They're all pretty funny.  #4 Coconut Cream Pie Shake. Bits of pie in a shake. Good as hell.  #5 Happy hour. Stop by and get a large Cherry-Limeade or Powerade Slush for 80 cents. You can't beat that.

I drove by this place a bunch of times going to Tempe Marketplace and from the outside it looked like a cool place that was worth a try. I went with a work group and we got crab cakes and calamari as an appetizer that were decent. I ordered the trout, which was just okay, it was quite plain tasting, not much flavor. I can't really say too much good about this place, its nothing special, it acts like a step up from Red Lobster, but its really not. At least Red Lobster has great smoothies and cheddary biscuits.

I've had Vietnamese at a handful of places in the valley and most places felt a little sketchy, the meat a little rubbery. However, this strip mall place is a step up from the average local Pho joint. The Crazy Noodle and Pho are both winners. The Vietnamese iced coffee is fantastic. Service is always great, prices are very reasonable.

I feel like it should be more popular.  What can I say: 1. Juicy burger w/ any cheese you want 2. Hand crafted shakes w/ real ice cream 3. Thin crispy fries (I like fries crispy)  Here's the rub, the food listed above is pushing 2000 calories, I'm 30 now and I live in Scottsdale, where I feel like everyone is fit or at least fairly thin. So my vanity keeps me out of there.  That aside, don't let the funny name keep you from stopping in, it's some good stuff.

A very classy Irish bar. Plenty of TVs and one projector screen for watching games. Good selection of about 15 European beers. Very quality bar food, I've had about half the menu and haven't been disappointed yet, but it's not going to blow you away by any stretch. The waitress staff is spotty with service, they seem to go in the back to the cooking area and stay awhile for no apparent reason. I would stick to sitting at the bar if possible. They have bands here on Thursday and Saturday and if you don't mind how loud they are, then it can be fun.

Why do people go to Hooters? I've never seen a girl with a decent rack there yet. You would think that would be a requirement of employment given the name of the place, but apparently it isn't. The peanut oil wings make me ill.  If you want to have young hot chicks dressed like tarts serve you greasy bar food then head downstairs to the Library or go to The Tilted Kilt (which actually has pretty decent food).

They had this place in downtown Iowa City and I went their in college probably twice a week and thought the meat and bread was great. Even last year I went back and I still thought it was top notch subbery.  I kinda think this place is just new and they don't quite have their act together yet, I just didn't feel it. I'm willing to try it again though.

As you come up to Pinnacle Peak this appears like it will be a daunting trek. As you watch people seemingly go straight up on switchbacks you may get the impression you are in for heavy workout. However, this is a hike for beginners to intermediate level and is a well-groomed, easy going trail. The first part of the trail leads you up close to Pinnacle Peak top, but then wraps around the mountain to three main checkpoints, to give you various amazing views of the city and mountains. There is enough parking close to the trailhead and some information on some of the shrubbery and cacti of the desert along the trail. I don't feel like most people are familiar with this mountain trail, but for any level of outdoor enthusiast I would definitely recommend it.

Not liking Red Robin is analogous to not liking freedom. It's a good burger at a good price. It's family friendly: arcade games, TVs, and the 'Red' bird mascot will bring a smile to people of all ages. I've gone for many years and I won't be stopping anytime.

Best place for lunch in the valley. At work whenever someone suggests Chipotle, I reply, "how about Habanero's instead".  What makes it the best: - 3 Salsas: Green, Red, and Habanero, all hot and each amazing - Freshly Pressed Tortillas - Your order is made fresh, the meat and fresh vegetables are all cooked just for you - Refillable Horchata - All for a good price under $10

I love gyros and this is the best one I've ever had. A healthy portion of meat is cut at the time of order from a giant fresh lamb shank.The pita bread is hot and fresh. Nothing else about the place is worth noting, just a great gyro.

A lot of these self service frozen yogurt w/ toppings places are popping up. This one is the best hands down. I love their peanut butter and oatmeal cookie flavors. Best tasting yogurt with the best pick of toppings. When I'm in the area, I can't resist not stopping in.

What's with the Vegas Strip these days, all the new hotel/casinos are all "velvet ropes and posturing". This place is style with some substance, and interesting architecture, however I enjoy the casinos in Vegas that give me a theme.  Average size rooms with a big bathroom, bathtub with a connected shower. The toilet is separated by a glass door for a quiet release. I've stayed at a lot of places in Vegas and this is the best room I've been in by a little bit, but I did have to pay for it. I have not stayed at the Wynn yet though, I will be there in May 2011 for a wedding, so I may have to update this review. The buffet is average, definitely no 'Rio Buffet', but their unlimited Mimosa can be worth it. I did enjoy the British bar (with a good draught selection) and the open bar in the casino area is decent. However, I do have a major beef that you get no break to get into their nightclub Haze for staying here like other hotels on the strip. Overall, this place lacks personality and doesn't feel 'fun'. I don't have any good reason for you to stay here.

This is a picture perfect desert mountain park that has something for everybody. There is a short zero-hills trail that has some fun and informative information on the trees/plants/wildlife that inhabit the area. There is a very wide array of more challenging hikes and if you keep moving along seemingly endless paths options for different areas to explore. This place is easy to get to and has plenty of parking. I've gone 3 times so far after moving to the area and can't wait to take another path. This is the premier place in the valley to enjoy he unique experience and beauty of the Sonoran desert.

Restaurant has a city view and a romantic ambience. Staff is friendly and attentive. However, the dinner menu is just decent at best as pricey as it was. I just can't really throw out anything worth noting about the dinner considering the price of $100+ for two.

Good lord, the Italian Beef Sandwich is great-big-juicy-gloriousness. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is I've had the rest of the menu and it's forgettable.

Mexican bar with some class in North Scottsdale. Open atmosphere, large patio, with a dual sided outside-connected bar. The chips are thin and hot with a salsa bar with 5 different types of varying heat levels. I usually get the tasty street-style tacos with a big portion of quality meat filling. Good selection of mexican beers on tap. There is one negative, their house margarita is a little weak, in a small glass, and was filled with too much ice. I hit up this place often though because of the combo of quality, quick service, and price.

I had an issue with my AC unit that was connected to ventilation with my swamp cooler. One summer the AC stopped functioning and my house got very humid and I couldn't get my house cool. I tried a few 'popular' valley air conditioner repair companies and was sorely disappointed at their ability to fix my issue. After a month of headache, I got fed up and called SRP, and they referred me to this repairman. Absolute Zero was like finding a glass of ice water in the hell of the Phoenix summer.  The main repairman who came to my house was incredible. He had more devices to test the AC and quality of air coming through vents in my home than Inspector Gadget. He took out my swamp cooler, calibrated my AC, and found out my dryer was not hooked up to the vent correctly causing excess humidity. As soon as he was done, I couldn't quite turn my AC down to the bottom of the Kelvin scale, but I could enough to see my breath.

The donuts are the best I've had in the valley. The iced coffee I really enjoy, and for 2 bucks you can't beat it. I made a mess in my car eating the crumble donut one morning, but it was so good I didn't regret it. I had a croissant filled with ham and cheese last time I went that was delicious. I give this place 5 stars for a few reasons. My father is a true doughnut connoisseur. He came to visit me, and after I took him there once, he demanded to go there everyday on his trip and proclaimed, 'you just can't get a donut this good anymore'. The other reason is value, you can eat a donut and coffee for a couple dollars. In a world where Starbucks will charge you $5 for a mediocre latte, I'll take Bosa over them anyday.

I've never been less excited for donuts when I see the rack on display behind the counter when I walk in. The coffee is pretty plain. The sandwiches did not excite me. I'm told Dunkin' is all the rage in the east coast. The guy I work with is from Boston and he goes there every morning, so he must think it's something special. I just don't get it, I'd rather go to Bosa Donuts, McDees, Starbucks, or just about anywhere comparable to it.

I walked into the upscale burger joint and was impressed at the large layout, burger choices, televisions, and draught beer selection. However, the first burger I got was so undercooked, it was red on the outside. So, I showed the waiter and his eyes opened wide and said, 'wow, that is very rare, let's redo that.' The next burger I got was burnt on the outside and red on the inside. I didn't make a big stink about it, I just paid the bill and walked out with no plan to ever return.

Our waitress took forever to get the drinks, the chips, and our order. My wife got a margarita, for a mixed drink that comes from a tap, I guess it was okay. When I got my enchilada/taco dinner I was rewarded with a blandness of flavor you just don't get very often. The most interesting part of the meal was my friend who ordered the potato taco, it resembled a flattened dead rodent more than a taco. I'm amazed that she even took a bite of it. I did laugh heartily at her frowned expression after trying it, so it was good for comedic value.  I did go to the old Matta's a few years back and it was decent, but seriously, don't waste your time going here.

This place is popular and for good reason. The pizza is above average, but if you are going there I would partake in some skilfully crafted italian dishes. The macaroni and cheese is unique as it comes. The rolled flat noodle with bolognese sauce was worth the price of admission. If you are going there, go hungry, get your carb, sauce, melted cheese, a glass of wine, and get happy.

I read through some long reviews of this buffet prior to writing this, so I'll keep it short. I love and have been to many Vegas Buffets, because I occasionally enjoy eating as much food as I can in one sitting. For the breakfast buffet, this is the best quality and selection, for the price, that I've had in Vegas. I would go back in half a heartbeat.

This bar is placed right in the casino area with 3 levels and literally has a giant chandelier surrounding the entire bar. We got a seat near the bar and had a cool friendly bartender on a Saturday night (a rare commodity in the Vegas strip). If you like people watching, there were hundreds of girls in short sparkly skirts walking around the place and heading towards Marquee club. Hip and chill place for a drink, not too loud, I'll stop by again for sure when I'm in Vegas again.

This location is never too busy, clean, staff is friendly, and quick. Here is my synapsis on the current state of McDonalds.   McCafé and Breakfast: I went to Starbucks today and paid $6.43 for a Latte and muffin and it wasn't that great. I would much rather have a Vanilla Iced Coffee and Egg McMuffin from McDonalds, it's always tasty and consistent.  McRib: Rib Meat shapened into a Rib Bear Claw is awesome, I don't care what you aristocrat haters think.  Salads: Buying a salad from McDonalds is like going to a Mexican restaurant and ordering a cheeseburger. Besides, I don't think I trust salad from a giant fast food corporation.  Snack Wrap: A satisfying 'in between' meal.  Burgers: Kinda weird burger meat, but unique, kinda good.

A variety act that is parody of vaudeville with acrobatics on a tiny stage. To break it up they have raunchy comedy that made me laugh my butt off. What makes this show so good is how intimate it is. There isn't a seat in the small tent that isn't a perfect spot. You see the sweat coming from the gymnast, you will be scared that the insane roller skater couple might fly onto your lap. A lot of muscle ripped men with their shirt off if you are in to that. Best show I've seen on the strip by far.

I've ate the majority of the menu and I enjoy it all. The plates feel fresh and fairly healthy. I've also been to various locations in the valley and find them to be consistent. The Thai iced tea is a delicious creamy one. For the price and style of food that you don't normally eat everyday as an American, I highly recommend this chain.

There is a lot of competition in Phoenix for wood fired pizza. Out of your options of Bianco/Grimaldi's/La Grande Orange/CPK, the pizza in itself here ranks in the middle. Given how busy the other places get, if you are located in the area, I highly recommend this little place.   They have wine and some bottled beer, the salads are quality and fresh, but I wouldn't go there just for a salad. For the pizza selection you have fairly standard gourmet options, ingredients are top notch, and the crust is made fresh daily. The pizza is mouth watering when you see it and is equally satisfying when the warm crust hits your mouth.  This place opened up recently and I see myself there quite a bit.

This is a good place to have a drink if you are in the area. I've had the burgers and gourmet hot dogs and they are above average. Solid selection of draught beer and bottles, but you've likely had the majority of them already. It's a clean, well lit place, with a small patio. I'm down the street from so I'll likely hit it up here and there, but not really worth going out of your way for.
