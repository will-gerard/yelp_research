DON'T BUY THE SOUVENIR MUG!    Contrary to what they tell you, other locations will not honor it for use/refill.   Long story short, I bought the frozen mug because the server said that other locations would fill it for the "man beer" price and you would get a few ounces more as it is a tad bit bigger than the standard glass mug. For the $20 bucks I thought that would be cool.   Look it to my local AZ location. Received a few comments from others at the bar and had a few folks interested in checking out the vegas location on their next trip. Bar tender filled it up when I explained what/where it was from. Having fun so far, glad I bought it.   After enjoying my beer and burger, asked for a refill. Was told that she couldn't because the manager said no.   Not her fault. I was upset that the manager didn't tell me himself (lame to make tipped staff give bad news; what if I was not a cool guy and took it out on her tip?) and that the vegas store either lied to me or their corporate does a horrible job of communicating what these mugs are to the non-vegas locations.   I emailed corporate so I'll update this if they respond. In the interim, as cool as the mug is (good quality, stays cold forever), don't buy it unless you don't care about using it locally (ie outside vegas).   Oh, the food was awesome as always and the server was attentive, important in Vegas. One star because of the mug fiasco.

One of the few places chuckles hasn't reviewed, lol.   Frankly an excellent burger, quality bun and fries worth the calories. The tots rock too.   Eat here, you won't be disappointed. Also, a shout out to the bar staff, they are attentive and prompt

If zero was possible, well, that's what I would put. Sat down, not even that busy, and it took 10 min for a waiter (had to ask for one). Then order is taken...and 30 min later, food. Sandwiches and salads. Really?!? The plus was the food is good, but way too slow for a restaurant.

Dr Abbott is the best! We drive across the valley to see him. The team is always very helpful and they work around my tough schedule (always a challenge). Dr Abbott always provides quality care and takes the time to listen and address any eye concerns. Given my daughters tendency to find issues (I see streaks), this is a huge help. Anyway, best eye doc in the valley by far!

Best. Gym. Ever.   Seriously, you will get a great workout here.   I come for the classes in the late afternoon with the group. Nice people and Arthur works you hard. I actually feel awesome when I'm done for having survived :)

Stopped in as my cars in the shop. Not much from the outside (typical strip mall suite), but WOW these are some good donuts! Had an old fashioned and it was perfect. Also had an egg bacon bagel. Perfect and very big. Friendly staff to boot.   If your on the fence, give this joint a shot. Worth it.
