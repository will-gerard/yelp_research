Now that construction of the light rail is finally complete, I find myself going to Cheuvron't s for lunch a whole lot more. It's a great place to meet up with people partly because you don't have to deal with a snotty hostess shooting you stink eye for wanting a table before your whole party arrives. They're friendly AND happy to see their customers there. Plus, they have Humboldt Fog on the cheese menu so I can always get a taste of home.   For lunch I usually order either the Summer Salad (chicken, grapes, apples, candied pecans with mixed greens and balsamic dressing) or the Chicken and Spinach salad (includes strawberries and I substitute pecans for almonds). This week I tried something new and was relieved that it turned out pretty good. I had the sesame crusted tuna steak "sandwich." It's served atop a ciabatta roll that is too crusty to eat like a regular sandwich so just use your knife and fork. And, next time I will definitely ask for more of the chipotle mango mayo on the side for dipping. Good flavors.   BONUS: you can get a to-go iced tea with your check and they don't charge you for an extra drink!  This also is a great place to meet up for a pre-show drink if you're headed to the theater. I also have heard good things about their brunch menu on the weekends so that might have to be on the itinerary for a Sunday trip to the Art Museum via METRO. Yes. Yes. Go, eat cheese, drink wine, be happy. Yes.

Happy hour includes $5 appetizers and discount on wines by the glass. Try to pork empanada (little piece of heaven) and the chicken phyllo pockets.

We are so lucky! The Valley is home to the Desert Botanical Garden - one of the country's most accomplished and spectacular gardens. Sure it's a great place to give out-of-town guests a sampling of what life in the desert is like. But, did you also know about the Garden's calendar of events?! Go to Agave on the Rocks!!! It will give you a whole new appreciation for desert plants and the sweet nectar known as tequila.

Lunch from the Duck is something to look forward to. They call their sandwiches Nooners ... how could you not love that?!  It's a step above your typical deli, so be prepared to pay $10 for a sandwich. Yes, a sandwich. Everything is made fresh to order. I usually go for the albacore, which includes celery and water chestnuts, and I add Havarti and pickles. Yummm. They're a reliable source for Selma's chocolate topped rice crispie treats, too.  Call ahead to find out what the daily soup special are, and if they have chicken and dumplings GET IT.  You also can order online - whether you just want something for yourself, or you need a platter of sandwiches and some fresh baked cookies for a meeting. Ordering ahead will save you a little bit of time, which helps since the visitor parking is limited (you can use the garage and I think they validate).   All three stores are family owned and operated. You get a great lunch AND you get to support a local business. It's a win-win.

Okay Einstein's store on Camelback and 16th Street, I have to ding you for this. DON'T sweeten the ice tea. Your brewed Spontineatea (or however you spell it) is great WITHOUT the simple syrup. Let customers choose to sweeten their drink if they want.   I spent $1.99 on a large tea that I couldn't drink without it triggering my gag reflex. Poured most of it down the drain instead. Nasty stuff.  Until you offer plain old unsweetened ice tea I'm not giving you your star back.

I've heard great things about the food but I was disappointed. We had a reservation, arrived on time but were not seated for 20 minutes. Service was friendly and knowledgable but it took forever to get our entrees - about 45 minutes AFTER our appetizer was finished and gone. I ordered Steak Oscar and I'm pretty sure they had grill running WAY too hot - my steak was crispified on the outside and rare on the inside. The desserts were the highlight of the meal and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. My first impression: overpriced and overrated.

I'm going to put the caveat on this review that I am friends with a few of the family members who own Rosita's BUT, I got to know them by coming in to eat.   The fried beef tacos are a fantastic indulgence. But I've discovered that I'm a fan of their carnitas too. Their fish tacos are great - marinated not battered and friend. And, if you're not a bean eater, try to sopa de fidello (noddle soup).   From the bar, consider the house margarita or the matriarch's namesake cocktail - Rosita's Tea.   Check your attitude at the door, sit back, relax, and enjoy.

They have this almond chicken sandwich with pesto that is delish! I usually get it on whole wheat bread with dofino cheese. It absolutely falls apart so be ready to finish it with your knife and fork. The bakery is packed with tasty looking treats but I have yet to succumb to that tempation ... it will happen eventually, though.

The dance floor is big and open, and offers some of the BEST people watching. It's one of those places where you can celebrate with friends or strike a conversation with someone new (and cute). I like the patio but I wish stinky smokers would just stay home. I'm grateful for the indoor smoking ban so I'll take what I can get. It's one of those places where I know I will always have a good time and funny stories to tell at the office on Monday.

Same great menu as the location on University but a whole lot less crowded (except during lunch rush). The sandwiches are all huge, so either order the half, which is really more like a 3/4, or be prepared to share. The sandwiches are all toasted panini style, too, on their signature bread.  FYI - if you love avocado on your sandwich (I don't ... yuck!) they are far from generous with it. And, if you ask for extra be prepared to pay for it. My friend has tried to flirt, negotiate and argue her way into free/extra avocado. No dice!  I usually go for the soup in a bread bowl, especially the Wisconsin cheddar. It has carrots and celery and is flavored with bacon. It qualifies as a "little piece of heavan" IMHO.   About the only down side is that you will smell like the inside of the deli for the rest of the day. It's not a particularly bad smell (something like toast, cheese and bacon) but  it can make you crave more Dilly's even when you're stuffed.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about JFY?! I've hesitated to give them a review and rave about what a fantastic aesthetician Sylvia is for fear that people would discover this gem of a salon and I wouldn't be able to get my regular appointment. I realized, however, that JFY treats its customers like it treats its staff - as if we were family.   They provide great service and take wonderful care of you. And, you have the luxury of knowing your stylist, manicurist or aesthetician won't be "here today, gone tomorrow." Most have worked there for several years.  I'm one of many reviewers to give them 5 stars, and those are 5 well-deserved stars.

So far, Paul has rescued countless pairs of shoes, two purses and three suitcases for me. His work is good, consistent. And, he is honest about what he can/can't do to fix your stuff. I think it pains him a bit to see how I sometimes love my shoes to death but he does his best to breathe some life back in to them.   I appreciate that there are still craftsmen available who do what this guy does. Yes he can seem like a curmudgeon, but I respect his work and take his lectures with a grain of salt. (Yes, I do know I shouldn't wait until I've worn through the insoles before I bring my shoes in for repair, but I'm not going to change him anymore than he's going to change me.) It's worth it if I can get another year or two out of my favorite Cole Hahn or Donald Pliner or Kenneth Cole or oh I love shoes....

Checked out the Phoenix Art Museum's Walkabout world music and food event on Sunday. It was a great way to spend a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The music was good and there was great food sampling from several restaurants - Breadfruit, India Palace, Cafe Lalibela, Tradiciones, Wild Thaiger, etc.   After we were sated on jerk chicken and strawberry tamales, we ducked into the museum to see the illustrations of the Rubáiyát. Elihu Vedder illustrated this 12th century Persian poem and took a very classically Christian approach. Interesting exhibit but a bit tiresome for the eyes. Since we were there, we checked out severa other exhibits, including photography from Linda Connor.   I feel more cultured and, if the Art Museum has more food events like Sunday, I'll be a repeat customer.

Needed a fix and hadn't had a Sacks sandwich in a few months. It was delish and reminded me why I love their food. Today, I had a simple chicken salad sandwich with lettuce, cucumbers and provolone. Of course, I had to get an iced tea and one of their snikerdoodle cookies. I also like to get the Symphony sandwich - turkey, bacon, sprouts and cream cheese (I 86 the tomato and guac.); or the grilled cheese with a choice of cheeses; and a few friends regularly crave the Dali - egg salad.   The location on Thomas is always packed at lunch - it's really popular with the docs and nurses from St. Joseph's Hospital. Get there by 11:30 or wait until 1; or order over the phone and have it delivered (minimum 4 orders). If you do call in an order, make sure you know which of the four stores you're calling and don't forget that they're only open until 2.

No, cake cannot replace sex, but it definitely tastes good. I've tried both the carrot and chocolate cake, and will order the latter whenever I have a chance.   I also have had the quiche of the day - very tasty - and their raspberry dressing is pretty yummy.   It's not a large place and can fill up fast. They are looking to franchise if anyone is interested.

This is one of the few chain restaurants that I love. The happy hour is pretty relaxed but it does attract the khaki-pant-buttondown-shirt crowd. The stuffed porked tenderloin is delicious and I'm a big fan of the appetizers. Plus the Sixth Street margarita (on the rocks WITH salt, thank you) is worth fighting downtown Tempe traffic.

Tried the Z'Tejas brunch for the first time today. Yummmmm. Check out the self-serve blodymary bar when you walk into the dining room - lots of options. We chhose the mimosas with fresh squeezed oj. Before they bring your entrees, you get a muffin and berry sorbet with fresh berries. The eggs benedict is good - very fresh - but it's MUCH better with the chipotle hollaindaise instead of the regular stuff. The chicken and potato hash is pretty great and I've heard good things about the breakfast enchiladas. I think most locations offer brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 10a to 3p.

Like Amy S. I'm a big fan of Sue. She has helped me book several trips over the years - Christmas in Hawaii, cruise to Alaska, volcanoes in Costa Rica. Most recently, she went to bat for us to arrange a trip to Argentina. She's never been there but did her homework to figure out the best options and has a wonderful resource for booking packages throughout Latin America.  Sue also knows that I don't like to have every minute scheduled. She is very good about recommending a mix of those don't-miss attractions and still letting me have a good amount of time to explore on my own.   And, she doesn't quite until the job is done. More than once she's had to call me after the office has closed to fill in some piece of info I managed to leave off my registration form.   You can do a lot of research and booking on your own. But when it comes to a new adventure in a country I've never visited before, it's nice to have someone like Sue in your corner.

I have had some of my best meals in Arizona here. The menu changes frequently but the chef has a great way of creating wonderful flavor combinations. The waitstaff is very knowledgable and ready to offer suggestions, without being pushy (of course I'm a sucker for waiters who talk cheese to me). It's a fun lunch place to take guests visiting from out of town. It's also one of my favorite date places.

Their arrangements are attractive and feature a great combination of whatever is in season, but its their customer service that impresses me most.   Recently I ordered a centerpiece and three small bowl arrangements for a friend's baby shower. They called me to discuss preferences of color, styles and flowers. They came in under budget. They delivered them on time. And, five days later, the flowers still look fresh.  I also dropped by once on the fly and they had several ready-made arrangements to choose from They also offered to add little touches to make it exactly what I wanted. I was rudely told by two other stores in my neighborhood that ALL arrangements had to be ordered in advance. I say pfffffffft to that.  Now the bonus is that they're in a shopping center with other locally owned restaurants and stores where I prefer to shop. So, Flower Shoppe definitely gets my future business.

This is definitely on my Top 10 Places to Go for Lunch list, if I had such a list. They call if American fare with a Moroccan flair, and it works!  I've tried a few items from the menu and always enjoyed the salads and kisras. A few friends are big fans of the bleu cheese burger. However, my hands down favorite is the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich - grilled chicken with mixed greens, pomegranate vinaigrette, goat cheese, sliced pears and dried cherries on a ciabatta roll. It's got this blend of sweet, tangy and creamy going on that makes me crave it.   Definitely get a basket of fries - one is enough for 2-3 people to share. There are four different flavors, and if it's not too busy, they will let you do half and half with two types of fries. I like them all and usually let whoever I'm with choose the flavors. Funny thing is that I'm not much of a french fry person, but I probably like these because you don't need any ketchup on them.  They have a very impressive wine list and I've heard good things about their happy hour and brunch. Will have to try those soon (been saying that for about two years now, of course).  Service is usually pretty friendly, prompt and accommodating. If you ask them for suggestions, they're knowledgeable enough to explain the different flavors and they're not afraid to tell you which ones are their favorites.

FINALLY made it to Fez for brunch. After sucking down a few of the $3 Mimosas, I dined on the signature omelet. It came stuffed full of their yummy, yummy gyro lamb, feta cheese and pappadeaux peppers - a great mix of savory, sweet and spicy.   Each of us ordered something different that morning, and there was nothing but the garnish left on our plates. Safe to say we all gave it a thumbs up.

This is one of those places I've been going to for years and am just now getting around to sending them some long-overdue Yelp! love. T.C. Eggington's is a great family-owned half-day cafe. Tom and Kathy started this place so that they would both be able to be home when their kids got out of school. They started with a commitment to serving up freshly made and delicious food in a comfortable, bustling (but not hurried) environment. They've been doing exactly that for about 20 years now (and I think the kids have finished college). Clearly, they have the right formula and they're smart enough to not tinker with perfection.  As for the menu, bring a BIG appetite. My favorites are the O'Pear omelet (bosc pear slices with bacon, havarti cheese and almonds) and the signature Eggington omelet (chicken, mushroom, cream cheese and broccoli smothered in Hollandaise....yummmmmm). I'm a sucker for their potatoes, too. The pancakes are like fluffy giat pillows of deliciousness. For the best of both worlds, substitute a pancake for the English muffin with your omelet.   If you're perusing the lunch menu, consider the albacore tuna, apple, walnut salad - crisp, fresh and filling. The Natie Bomb and the grilled chicken feta sandwiches also are high on my list of favs.   Of course, if you don't want to power down 1200-2500 calories in one meal, you can get half orders or take a friend and share a meal. The smoothies and fresh baked muffins also are great lighter alternatives.   If you have family in from out of town, it's a great breakfast/brunch option. And, it's very kid friendly.   Tip: Ceci G. is right! It's a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time especially on the weekends.

Hmmm. What can I say about Changing Hands that hasn't already been said. It gets great reviews for a reason because it is what it is - a fantastic independent, neighborhood  bookstore. It's locally owned and those local owners get a whole lot of coin out of me every year, especially at the holidays. I love that I can walk there from my house. I love that it's attached to Wildflower Bread Co. I love that they have as many of the eclectic titles as they do the mainstream sellers. And, thanks to the staff picks, I discovered books like "Water for Elephants" and the "English Major" last year.   If you're expecting a pristine store, get off your high horse. The shelves get a bit messy by the end of the day (no where more so than in the kid's books) because this is one of those stores where patrons will sit down on the floor and peruse the first few pages of a book to decide if it's one they want to buy. The staff, however, is always quick to help you find something in the clutter.  They host myriad author readings, including John McCain and Abigail Thomas. They also put together events for major releases of new books, like a midnight sale of the final book in the Harry Potter series.   If I should be so lucky, I would want to own/operate a book store like Changing Hands when I retire ... got about 20 years of visiting the store between now and then so maybe I can learn a few of their secrets to success.

My wish is that everyone could have a place like Mac's that's a short walk or bike ride from home. I've been known on occasion to drag my tired self in there on a Sunday for breakfast and mimosas.   The food is good pub/American fare and the wait staff is pretty friendly. (I snarked at one poor server for calling me "ma'am" but he rallied and we're now on a first-name basis.) I'm a fan of the breakfast burrito. The huevos rancheros are okay but not very spicy. The queso is tasty and they have a sinful grilled cheese sandwich. Plus, I like that they have Sunbru and Smithwick's on tap.  Mac's is sandwiched between two fantastic Tempe gems - Changing Hands Bookstore and Hoodlums Music and Movies. I definitely recommend you shop BEFORE you eat/drink, though. Trust me! I've learned from experience...

It's safe to say that I'm addicted to their broccoli cheese soup. I do my best to manage my addiction, limiting my Pugzie's intake to just once a month. When I do indulge, it's soup, bread, giant chocolate chip cookie and ice tea. Then I'm a happy camper.  The building is a funky time warp of decor and architecture - inside and out. Dining in is an experience, but I usually get my fix to go (tip: call ahead and pick it up at their drive thru window).   When I don't cave to my craving for the soup, I switch things up with the chicken salad. I like that they mix chunks of pineapple and slivered almonds in to an otherwise basic chicken salad.   They offer several vegetarian and even gluten-free options, too.  They're only open for lunch, so plan accordingly!

This is a Tempe gem. I've debated on reviewing Miele's because it's my favorite neighborhood secret. However, Joe (and his brother) dishes out some of the best Italian food in town and definitely deserves some of the paying of the homage. It's the kind of place people go to enjoy their meal - that includes the food, the service, the conversation, the whole nine yards.  They specialize in pizza, hot/cold Italian subs and Sicilian-influenced entrees. The salads are large enough to be shared before dinner, and the Giuseppe's Chicken is pretty good. I usually order off the special menu posted on the wall ... actually I almost always get the chicken with artichokes, proscuitto and mozzarella. Sometimes I shake things up with a little of the white pizza. They serve a few Italian and California wines, but I usually choose a Moretti or Peroni. BTW, he also makes his own cannolis and if you don't get one you're soooooo missing out!

I'm getting a little suspicious that they put something addictive into their tuna melt because I CRAVE this thing. The focaccia bread is superb with the right balance of simple tuna salad and cheddar cheese. It's so good, I don't even mind the grease factor. I've learned that I have to go early, though, because they have been known to run out of crack...I mean bread.  Sometimes I've had to wait a bit for my sandwich to be ready. At least the people watching makes the wait entertaining. Plus, you know I'm a sucker for China Mist tea.

Katie and her husband run a clean, well-maintained shop. They do take appointments but you can always try dropping in - on Saturdays, it's just the two of them working so it helps to go ahead and make an appointment.   Their spa pedicure includes a hot stone foot massage. They offer all those extra treatments like hot wax but they don't push them on you or make you feel like you have ugly feet. Their prices are very reasonable - about $25 for a pedicure.   Katie does offer spa treatments like waxing but I've not used those services.

I've been taking my clothes to this family-owned shop for better part of 15 years. They're very conscientious about taking good care of your clothes and they have always been responsive to my requests. For example, I don't like when my stuff smells like the dry cleaning chemicals, so they make sure things get aired out before zipping them into my handy dandy green re-usable garment bags (which they also provide at no cost).  I also appreciate that they work very hard to keep up with technology and stay ahead of environmental issues.   Their on-site alterations service is pretty good, as well. And, they get bonus points for remembering their customers' names.  They aren't cheap but you get what you pay for - and with Bell that includes quality and good customer service.

It's not awful but it's not bad either. It's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff conssitently.   I do like the spinach dip, brisket and their BBQ sauces, plus there is always plenty to take home and it reheats well the next day. I'm not impressed with the side dishes (garlic mashed potatoes are good but those are hard to screw up).   It's an easy place to meet up with friends or bring out-of-town guests/kids. And, I might have to steal the leg lamp ... fra-gee-lay, that must be Italian.

It's absolutely fantastic to have a good place to go on Mill Avenue to be around other like-minded wine lovers (i.e., those of us old enough to know better than to drink wine from a box). The atmostphere is defeinitely more upscale than typical Mill Ave options, teetering on snobbish but that's part of why I like it. The bruscetta and pizza are pretty tasty but I need to go back and dig a little deeper into both the wine and food menus.

If you have out of town guests and need a special place for dinner, consider Il Terrazzo. It's "resort casual" dining, meaning the setting is elegant (even romantic) but you can get away with wearing jeans. The dinner menu is set up for a progressive dining experience. You can choose a starter, second course, main course and dessert, or you can mix and match for as large or small a meal as you want. They have a decent selection of wines by the glass - domestic and Italian - so that you could have different varietals with each course.   We started with the cheese plate - the choices were okay, not too special, but the accompanients were greats, especially the 25-year aged balsamic. For the second course, I had the agnolotti pasta stuffed with goat cheese and thyme. It's not served with any kind of sauce but eat them quickly or they'll get a little oily. My friend opted for the Lattuga del Burro - butter lettuce salad with buttermilk gorgonzola dressing, pancetta and baby tomatos. My main course was the Ossobuco with saffron rissotto - fall off the bone tender and fantastic flavor although a few bites of the rissotto were a little crunchy (undercooked). You can get any of the dishes on the pasta course as a main course size.  The ricotta cheese cake, hazelnut praline mousse and house-made ice creams are delectable, so save room for dessert.  They serve breakfast and lunch as well, which should be impressive based on what we saw at dinner.

Since I'm not a coffee drinker, I had to find something else to love about Hob Nobs. That was easy. The pizza. They're perfect size for lunch and I'm a big fan of the BBQ chicken pizza and the white pizza. I also suggest the Smoked Joe wrap (think that's what it's called). However, if you prefer the $5 footlong from Subway, Hob Nobs might not be the place for you. It ain't cheap. But, for the money, you get some really yummy food.  They also have this incredibly tempting dessert case. I gave in and got a cinnamon roll one day and was really happy I did.  The restaurant has free wifi and the password is on each of the tables. The artwork on the walls changes frequently. Always something interesting to look at. I like they way they do business and the friendly greeting you get when you walk in. I do wish they had more than 5 parking spaces, though.

I love that I can walk to Wildflower for a nummy fix of comfort food. I'm a big fan of the butternut squash ravioli, the Carribean Cob salad and the stuffed french toast.   They have this spectacular counter of delicious looking baked goods. Unfortunately, things tend to dry out. The cupcakes, on the other hand, are always wonderfully decadent. In fact, in October, they sold Cupcakes for the Cure and I definitely supported the cause.   The Tempe location is really popular with people in the neighborhood, so getting a table requires patience.

Lunch at Two Hippies Beach House can turn a Monday into a fun-day. I discover something new every time I go - like the Village People album covers, bumper stickers, action figures and list of 10 worst rock songs.  I love going for lunch and getting a couple of tacos and sharing and order of chips and salsa. The tacos (and burritos) come with pinto beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, onions and a wedge of lime, but nobody squawks when you place a special order. (Big surprise, I 86 the tomatoes.) I've tried the fish, chicken, pork and carne asada tacos, and I think the fish are my favorite while the pork are a close second. The chips are store bought but the salsa makes it worth it. BTW, the tacos are cheap - $2 each.   Their flavored lemonade is the bomb! I think I look for people to meet me there for lunch just so that I can get the blackberry lemonade. Pomegranate and raspberry are pretty tasty, too.  One of these days I need to try the red chili beef burrito...which gives me an excuse to go back.  I recommend carpooling if you're going for lunch. Parking is limited and the place gets busy quickly. They turn the food around fast, and you can always call ahead for a pick up order.

Popped into de la Cruz after opening night of Othello at the Mesa Arts Center. It was after 10:30 and their kitchen had already closed but our server and the manager could tell that we were famished. They offered to put together a few of the appetizers or a cut of prime rib, which they now feature on Friday nights.  We ended up getting their signature De La Cruz shrimp cocktail - yummmm - and the prime rib. Because their regular cut is so thick, my foodie friend and I asked to split it and we were grateful when we saw the size of the half portion (still 8-10 ounces). I was happily surprised by the quality, tenderness and flavor of the meat.  The manager was telling us that, in addition to the prime rib, they plan to keep the menu simple and feature a lot of different specials. They usually have some interesting wines, too, and we managed to suck down two bottles of the Twenty Bench Cabernet. That's a wine that I will have to look for at AJ's next time I'm there.   They now have live music on the weekends. The band was a bit loud but didn't seem to mind turning down the volume when asked.   That area of Mesa has sooooo much potential to be a great dining, retail and culture center. De La Cruz is pretty much the flag ship restaurant right now but I hope they succeed because it will be a huge windfall for the community.

This may have the coolest ambiance of any of the d/t PHX restaurants - a converted department store from another era. The food is always tasty - I'm a fan of the sandwich with prosciutto and hearts of palm and their pizzas, which are large enough to share. Recently discovered their desserts...get the DONUTS!!!!! The wine list is nice and the cocktails are inventive. Service is friendly and knowledgeable.   Was in the other night and the music seemed to be shuffling through about 4 CDs - Fleetwood Mac, John Mellencamp (from his Cougar days), Elton John, Heart and Santana. That probably gives you an idea of their demographic. :-)  If I'm going to be d/t, Hanny's is always in my top 3 choices of a place to start, hit and/or end up. Love the HH and the people watching is usually a highlight of the night.

Finally made it to Luci's for a wine tasting last night. It's not your typical store. It's better! And it looks like it's drawing a lot of regulars from the neighborhood who like to hang out in the coffee bar, chatting and people watching.   The emphasis is on healthy, local and eco-friendly food and products. They introduced me to Marilyn's tortilla chips and Simply Bread's cranberry walnut bread - big fan of both!!! Of course they have some fantastic gourmet items like my favorite cahill porter cheese and other indulgences as well.   There is a "community wall" where you can post your fliers for car washes, walkathons, workshops, garage sales, etc. They've been open for about two months and the wall looks like it's getting some good use.  My friend created the logo, signage and color palette for the store. I love his work and how it all comes together to make this a very welcoming neighborhood market. Now I just wish is was in MY neighborhood.

Now that I've had a chance to try a few different items, I feel like I have a sense of this place.   The food is fresh and tasty, The fish tacos are made with marinated talapia and served with a huge mound on fresh cabbage, pico and tomatoes. They're on the starter menu but the three tacos are a prefect lunch item as well. I'm also a fan of the seared ahi sandwich and usually get it with the fries and some extra lime vinaigrette on the side for dipping the sandwich. The chopped salad is this fantastic "kitchen sink" of fresh veggies and pieces of their applewood smoked bacon ... you had me at bacon.   The atmosphere is very relaxed, which is not surprising with the owners' Pischke's connection. I like the patio, and have been told that it's a great happy hour hangout and they have a nice weekend brunch service (that's on my to do list still).  Of course, they won me over with their friendly service and the free to-go ice tea.

Maybe a Sunday night of a Cardinals home game is not the best night to experience McFadden's but if they can't handle the football crowd then maybe they shouldn't have opened their doors at Westgate.   The female bartenders were RUDE. They passed my friend up several times before letting him order his drink. And, they got snarky with people sitting next to us. They seem to be cut from similar cloth and it ain't pretty.   The 30-45 minute wait for a table turned out to be more than an hour. No surprise, but they didn't bother to tell us we could have gotten a table on the patio off of the bar right away.   Ordered the turkey club sandwich which was supposed to be served with bacon and cranberry mayo on Texas toast. Guess I looked like I need to trim the fat from my diet because my sandwich was baconless. And, they ran out of sliders, buffalo wings and boneless wings BEFORE 7 p.m. What kind of bar runs out of bar food before the peak dinner crowd has even arrived???? The fries were pretty good and our table service was very friendly at least.   There are lots of TVs all tuned to the game and the Cardinals and Vikings fans all seemed to be getting along well. No pushing, shoving or name calling. So, the first impression was not great but I'm willing to give it another chance ... maybe.

I'm liking the breakfast bowls - you get a couple of eggs scrambled with your choice of up to six toppings - served over potatoes. I've gone the breakfast burrito route but I prefer the bowl. My potatoes were pretty greasy on my first visit, which was apparently their first day of business, but things have improved. BTW, you get your breakfast bowl with potatoes and Texas toast for only $6.  No doubt a big part of the appeal is the staff. The atmosphere is mas-o-menos and it's crowded with tables and junk, but the people who work there are great. Very fun, and they toss trivia questions out to patrons all morning on Saturdays.  Um, the bread pudding if AMAZING...  I'm excited to try their corn dog on a stick - without having to hang around a bunch of toothless county fair carnies to get it. Doh!   And, I love love love the pomegranate lemonade.   P.S. check your attitude at the door, sit down, relax and enjoy your food.

This is not your ordinary steak house and it's nice to have a great new option in the Valley. The Kentucky Derby garden party decor and hot/knowledgeable waitstaff are just two things that set Modern Steak apart.   The starter menu includes some unusual and tasty items like the "hot and cold wedge" salad and a Kobe beef foot long hotdog.  Entrees are served a la carte and the bone-in 20 oz ribeye is dry aged for a great rich flavor. Side dishes are generous portions, large enough to be shared, and I liked the Parmesan fries and asparagus. The wine list is pretty impressive too, and I'm not just saying that because they had my favorite Cliff Lede Cabernet.  If you have saved room for dessert, give the peanut butter cup a try.  Be prepared for the check. The starter, entree, side, dessert and wine add up. I'd probably give it five stars if it had a little more curb appeal. It's definitely worthy of a special occasion or a Monday night out with friends.

This is a mixed bag of thoughts about my one and only experience with this hospital but I feel the need to vent my frustrations.   I was scheduled for a cortisone injection into my hip joint, which is done under fluoroscope (X-ray). I was told the procedure would take about one hour and I was asked to not take any aspirin (blood thinner) for at least 24 hours prior to the appointment. My appointment was scheduled for 12:30 and my check-in time was noon.   I've never been to this hospital before, so I double checked my directions online before I left the office. Well, the campus map is NOT accurate. Outpatient Radiology is located in a whole different area. And, the directional signs for the parking lot were lousy. The signage inside the hospital is even worse. I wasted about 20 minutes wandering before a lab tech was nice enough to walk me all the way over to where I needed to be on the OTHER side of the campus.   When I did check in, I was told the procedure costs $2,000 and "was I prepared to pay that now?" Uh NO! Their computer system said someone attempted to contact me about their pre-payment policy but was unable to reach me due to an incorrect phone number. The admin person verified the number with me and it was correct. So since it appeared to be a mistake on their part, they let me just do a 10% deposit. Whatev. The pain was now moving from my hip to my pocketbook.  I also learned at check-in that my doctor had ordered some blood work, which usually took about 45 minutes to get the report. WTF? They got me in for the blood work pretty quickly but then I sat in the lobby for more than an hour.   Eventually, I got back to the procedure room - two hours after my scheduled appointment time - and saw the doctor. He and the two technicians were very thorough. If I could review them separately, I would likely give them 4-5 stars. My injection went fine even though they had to do it without iodine because no one had relayed to them that I'm mildly allergic to shellfish. I do feel I received quality health care, and I realize that is the most important thing (or at least I've been trying to tell myself that).   BTW, I tried to use their shuttle to get back to where my car was parked. The little bastard did a U-turn right in front of me and kept on going. So I got to walk about 1/2 mile back with a very odd feeling in my hip from the injection.   And, I got back to the office at 4. Grrrrrrr.  If I'm referred to that facility in the future I will most definitely ask if there are other options.

Wish I had jumped on the hot yoga bandwagon much sooner. Really enjoy going to Sumits. It's an incredible 80-minute workout that, thanks to the music, actually gets me to shut my brain down and not think about all the days' challenges. The workout is ideal for all yoga levels, and I feel like I can push my practice each time. The instructors are fantastic.  They're open seven days a week, and the weekend classes are really relaxed - not so crowded. The weekday evening classes can get pretty packed so get there early to stake out your space.  You can bring a friend for free on Tuesdays. Great way to try Sumits for the first time. Watch for deals around the holidays.

Love having a new brew house in town. The Fretzy unfiltered ale is excellent. they also are doing some inspired, original brews. I was surprised by how tasty the watermelon wheat ale is - smells like a Jolly Rancher but has a smooth, easy-to-drink flavor.   For you purists, they offer an IPA. I like it but like most IPAs I can suck down only one before it wipes out my taste buds for the rest of the day. The Fretzy on the other hand I could probably drink all day long, especially at a ballgame or hanging out in the pool. BTW they sell Fretzy at Diamondbacks games. Yay!  The guys making the beer are two of the foremost craft beer experts. In other words, they know what they're doing. And, they've figured out how to turn our lousy hard desert water into delicousness. Thank you for that.  I'm lobbying for them to start producing an amber ale. Until then, I'm withholding one star on my rating. Greg, you know what to do.

So happy to be able to enjoy Lawrence Dunham Vineyards wines right here in the Valley of the Sun (rather than trekking 3 1/2 hours south of here). Their new LDV Wine Gallery in Scottsdale is charming and perfectly suits their wines. The patio is lovely and will be a great springtime hangout for Sunday Funday.  I'm especially a fan of the Sky Island Viognier and the Signature Petite Sirah. Yes, I am partial to these varietals, but I'm not biased in saying the un-oaked viognier is fantastically aromatic and a great summer wine. Love noshing on some strong goat cheese when I'm sipping this beauty.  The Petite is my favorite deep shade or purple (almost black) with just a hint of spice and a velvety finish. I like to pair it with a well-marbled rib eye or lamb tenderloin. Of course, I'm also liable to pair it whatever I have in the fridge. It happens.  This is a small production, family-owned winery. Everything is estate grown. Their wines are priced in the mid $20-$40 range because their volume is small and their quality is high. These are first press wines. (If you want to pay less, then go get a bottle of some second press no-name label at the grocery store.) Trust me, LDV wines will not disappoint. Cheers!

After only one visit, I'm impressed enough to give Buck & Rider 5 stars.   Our dinner was delicious!   We started with crispy calamari (love the jalapenos in there) and a sushi roll with crab and macadamias. The rolls were bit bigger than bite sized (actually had to cut mine down) but flavors were great. Our entrees all lived up to their menu descriptions for flavor and freshness. Not sure I have the words to properly describe this intensely decadent chocolate cake we shared for dessert.   Service was very attentive. Pretty sure our server was training but she did pretty well with making recommendations from the menu. Atmosphere is very lively but casual.  Really liked their cocktail menu, but my one suggestion is that they add some Arizona beers and wines to their bar menu.   The sum total of our dining experience means we will be back for more.
