It was our 1 year anniversary so my bf made reservations to come here. Neither of us have ever been so why not give it a try!? Once we told them our name we were happily greeted and directed to our seats. They had a happy anniversary card waiting for us which was sweet. Everything sounded amazing and my bf suggested the 8oz pecan sirloin with garlic potatoes. He ordered 7 oz bleu cheese filet and veggies. We also ordered a spinach salad and split that. Words don't describe the service and the food! They brought us out a mocha Oreo billy m. pie as a surprise as well. Blanca was our waitress and we had high praises for her when the manager came over. All in all a highly competitive steakhouse with your traditional Scottsdale restaurants. I'd bypass them any day to come back to the keg! Keep up the great service and amazing food!

My fianc√© wanted a staycation before school started back up for the both of us. We knew there would be a gorgeous view and some entertainment value going to the talking stick so we booked the day before arriving to the resort.   When we first got there we used valet and the poor valet guy was all by himself but doing a great job. We checked in and went up to our room. We immediately walked in to an uncleaned bathroom floor and carpet. Our first impression should have been our gorgeous view of the mountains but it was the lack of cleanliness on the floor. It looked as if they used a dirty mop to move the dirt around in the bathroom and the carpet looked as if it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks maybe months. Stains throughout the floor and lots of dust. Not once did we take our socks off and we used flip flops to take a shower.   After we got settled we sat down on the bed and immediately felt like we sat and laid on tissue wrapping paper. The sheets were also dirty under the comforter. It sounded like we were a present because of how much noise the sheets made. Next the pillows were then extremely bumpy and uncomfortable. By no means are we luxury individuals but our target and bed bath and beyond sheets were 100% more comfortable.   We had dinner at their restaurant and did not mind eating at the bar. Our bartender was amazing and helped our experience. On Sunday morning we were woken up to grounds crews making lots of noise for about an hour and it was only 6 am. Rather then sleeping in and enjoying the view we had to close the door and curtains to help keep the racket down.  We finally got up and went to the casino until the buffet opened which was ok nothing special.   Just beware that the room was extremely disappointing for the price we paid especially for a staycation we would of rather stayed home and slept in our own bed.

We had an amazing experience with AZ pet stylist. Our stylist showed up early and took amazing care of our little guy! We have already recommended them to our neighbors.

I guess it's common sense to know that putting money in the jukebox was only going to be played after the UOfA basketball game. NOT!  Probably not the best management talk I have ever had. Considering only ASU students received 10% discounts not UofA. Awesome  job
