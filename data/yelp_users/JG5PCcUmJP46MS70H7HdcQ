This place might not be the best of the best of the best sir, with honors.... But I really like the pizza here, nice and crisp with quality ingredients. I took it to go so I could not really evaluate the service and atmosphere but all that matters to me is the food! Way better then papa johns, Pizza Hut, dominoes, or any other commercial mass produced pizza chains. I actually ate the pizza for the first time up in pine top lakeside in northeastern arizona and been hooked ever since. It's above average. See if it's for you

I'm sorry but this place probably has the worst turkey club i have ever had. thick sliced lunchable meat with regular american cheese, bacon, lettuce tomato. on a hot toasty bun... didn't quite sit right, i probably ordered the worst thing on the menu. but i wasn't to crazy about the potato chunk fried fries either..... but what do i know! the chicken fried steak is probably awesome, but i needed something light and quick at the time!   the place was really dirty above your head no telling whats getting on the food that you are about to eat. and all the walls were super cluttered with decor, and dusty hats hanging everywhere, kind of gross.  service was awesome, and the people were cool. but not enough to come back to.

Noticed the Big WORLD'S FAMOUS GYRO sign out front. walked in, very nice and friendly staff. awesome service. Unfortunately the gyro I got was really soggy, the meat and sauce was everywhere, not fresh, and the bread had a very distinct burnt taste to it. The fries were gross... I don't know what went wrong with this place, but it was packed out with people eating awesome looking salads.... I guess I ordered the wrong thing

I visit here regularly and get the cheesesteak. By far my number 1 favorite cheese steak in all the surrounding cities of Phoenix. all the food is great here, i try and bring friends when i can. love the atmosphere and toy trains moving about above everyone's head. lots of tv's and the staff has always been super awesome. everyone should try this place out if they are in the area, it's hard to be dissapointed. It's a true Gem.  The only complaint I have is that it's a Green Bay packers bar. We need more arizona cardinals bars!!! This is after all Arizona!

I love Haps! Tried and true some of the best pulled pork and brisket in the area. You don't have to wait in line forever and it's family owned and operated. It has all your bbq needs and at the right time. The baked beans are amazing! Corn bread is awesome too. Ribs are not to popular, but give them a try. I feel as if they are hit or miss. I see a line here most of the time, but it goes quickly because the owners know that there customers want to be in and out and not wait for 2 hours in line! Sometimes you don't have that much time to spend on some brisket...Especially in the summer. I highly recommend this place and have been going here for 4 years. They deserve lots of credit for lasting this long as a small business with so much competition, you know there 1 of the best bbq spots in the valley. All you haters think you know what real bbq is blah blah blah, fact is, it's all a matter of opinion. If you don't like it, move on. Because obviously a lot of people love this place and it keeps people coming back, even you bad reviewers. If you don't like sauce on your sandwich get it on the side genius! If you want to wait in line for 2 hours go to little miss bbq. But this place is amazing, with amazing people and food. Try it for yourself, you might just find yourself going back again and again.

First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy. Everything is great here, I look forward to being a regular. It's super close to my company's office!

Thought I would stop in at this place since it is close to work, it's healthy, and it's clean. Looks like a converted subway with an actual grill. Fresh veggies and pita bread. I ordered the Hercules that has gyro meat inside of it with your regular things inside, but I'm picky and didn't get some veggies I don't like. The lady plops the meat on the grill to heat it up and I'm already disappointed. Gyro meat should never be grilled on a grill, ever. And they weigh it out so I knew it wasn't going to be enough meat, and it comes with double meat! My wrap was sad. But I blame myself. This place is just not for me. Was also disappointed they didn't have ice tea made. Looks like they are equipped for it but get lazy and don't make it. I won't be coming back, but I did like the atmosphere, the concept, and it is a genuine original good idea for an alternative to a sub shop. So it's definitely better for your body to eat here. Just not for me. If your mainly a meat eater and not much of a health nut, go somewhere else

Sorry Tom. But this ones for you. It's all about the food and service for me. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with onions strings. Very friendly service at the register. I got my food very quickly. It was a Tuesday and kids eat free on Tuesdays! Love that. But when I got my food my pulled pork sandwich was super soggy, when you bite into the pulled pork sandwich it's a mixture of water juices and soggy bread with a load of BBQ sauce on 1 side of the sandwich. So I got myself some extra BBQ sauce and tried picking this thing up to eat it and it just falls apart everywhere. This is a sandwich you will most likely need a fork for. If you like licking your fingers and making a mess, go for it! The onion strings were good, really greasy and I would prefer needing to be a little crispier...but they were good. All in all the service is great very nice staff, very nice place.i will need to test out the brisket next.... And then the ribs. This is strike one, maybe they can make a home run with me next time.

Good Italian.   great fresh pizza sauce and dough! me and the wife order the sauce and the dough by itself on occasion cause it's so good and only 3 bucks! then we add our favorite quality ingredients. we love it here, and visit occasionally.  The good things that Floridinos does is that they have some good fresh food: bread, pizza, sauces, pasta  Some not so fresh things we stay away from seems to be the chicken in any form, it tastes good, it's edible, just not fresh. Have not tried it all the food but you'll figure out your likings if you go here regularly. You notice that a lot of things are just heated up in the oven when ordered making food a bit soggy and pasta a bit dry and crunchy  The customer service here is awesome! Smart people, nice, quick, you name it. Service is great.  To go orders ate great here to. I love getting orders to go all the time

Pesto's is awesome! pizza is really good. i always ask to please make a little extra crispy:) it's usually a little to doughy if i don't say something. love the atmosphere, it's usually pretty busy. great selection of wines, they have beer too. i like getting a pizza to go usually. but if i have time it's nice to sit down. i recommend.

Our waiter was awesome, the place was comfortable but run down a little. Burgers were huge, tasty, and delicious. The string frys we had were crisp, fresh and hot. The wings were awesome the soft pretzel was really, really good. And everything came out super fast! Good beer selection. A really good all around place. And we are picky people:) it was a little pricey, but well worth the good food and atmosphere

this place is awesome! so much food! a little pricey, but it's quality. food is fresh with normal sized servings. lots of drinks to choose from! you really feel comfy here. it's quiet and lots of family oriented people here. very nice sweet staff, i can't really find anything bad about the place. the menu is huge! i bet they could add alot more to it if they wanted to. place smells fresh. i had the Turkey Club for my first visit, with fries and a drink. 15 bucks! Better be Amazing! i took a picture of it and posted it. it's big, but normal for a club, and overpriced for 10.99 just for the sandwich.... it is scottsdale. and overpriced food is what you usually get in this area, so i'm not to surprised. fries were ok, your normal frozen fried product. Iced Tea is awesome! all in all, place is great and i would probably return to try another item. i like the feel here. i recommend to anyone to atleast try it and see if it's for you

Arrived at prime lunch time 11:54. First time here, not very busy. But it's Wednesday, and it looks more like a night life place anyway. Walked in and it's seat yourself, so I found a spot to sit down at and snap a couple pictures of the menu... I got awesome fast service right away. I have been to a couple zipps sports bars and i like burgers, so that's what I got here. Looks like its a sister to zipps or the same owners. They have 2 levels to the place, and it's very nice. Lots of games to play upstairs like darts, pool, shuffle board. Tv's everywhere. Place is a little loud though. Music blasting. Lots of room, and lots of seating. Looks like the from the reviews that you shouldn't come at night time, to busy and slammed that the food and service begins to turn to crap. Go at lunch! its really accommodating and way better. Food came out 10-15 minutes and hot. Burger was a little dry and lacked seasoning, but after I poured blue cheese and BBQ sauce all over it, it was good. Chips are excellent. I will come back for lunch, very chill place at lunch time. Friendly fast service.

Nice little hole in the wall, family owned and oriented. I walked in at about closing time and the place was packed to the gills! But mostly because it was friday and there was family visiting the family that owned the place. It didn't feel uncomfortable at all, they cleared a spot for me to sit inside and everyone was very nice. I ordered a double club sandwich. Sandwich was delicious, yes it's a sandwich.... But you'd be surprised how many places cannot make a decent sandwich these days. I will come back to this little gem, and i do believe they deliver, go and try this special place out and taste for yourself. I recommend.

Pizza is not cardboard like at all... But I really wouldn't know cause I've never eaten cardboard before. Read reviews of this place and it was really up and down, so I needed to see for myself.   First thing, awesome prices! It's very reasonable, $2.75 by the slice for pepperoni. I brought a drink, so my lunch was cheap, even if I wanted 2 slices, it would have only been about 6 bucks. They have appetizers, pastas, entrees, hot and cold subs, calzones, deserts, and of course pizza! All low priced for this area. I normally spend 10-15 bucks on lunch. But not here!  The cute girl at the front said everything is good here and there is really not a specific popular item, so i ordered my pizza and it was on the table really hot and and ready to eat.   This was my first experience, and I will definitely come back and try the other various menu items.   I'm very satisfied with the service, food, and prices. I don't really think you can beat this place in the area it's in and at lunch time.

so far, not impressed. walked in, place has 1 table full of about 8 people. and  a couple people waiting for food. other then that, all the other tables are vacant, and dirty! it's not busy, why isn't it clean? i sit at a dirty table... dude says it will be 6-7 minutes and if i mind the wait... i said no. 10 minutes go by, and i only ordered 2 slices of pepperoni. you think this would be ready at lunch time, right? maybe not...so it takes longer then what he said... i get it in 15.. and it is just cheese pizza re heated up with whatever topping you want, not fresh.... but hot as hell! sauce is not very tasty, dough is very bland. the cheese was really good though, and the hint of italian herbs seasoning help the taste. The crust was nice and crisp though... i wont be back. food didn't do it for me. even if a place is dirty and unorganized, i'll still come back if the food is awesome!!! but not the case at Pisa Pizza. It's ok food with a dirty atmosphere, 2 tv's and only 1 on playing nothing interesting.... very boring nothing special, not very good service.... i'll say no more.

this place is very unique. it really has great food, i took a picture of the back of the menu that tells the story of this place, it's quite intriguing! i walked in and the lady told me the debit/credit machine is down:( was slightly disappointed because this is where i wanted to eat! so i had to go to quick trip down the road and grab some cash out of the ATM. not to big of a deal, but this would turn most people to another place to eat. i ordered the chorizo plate. the food came with a choice of tortilla's or bread, i got tortillas of course! food was really good and fresh, and you can tell the kitchen is clean cause you can see it! the chorizo unfortunately was not spicy at all, but it was really good so i'm not going to complain to much. i would definately recommend this place because it's really the only decent place around this commercial warehouse area that you can sit down and relax, maybe do some computer work if ya need. it's really perfect for lunch meetings or even breakfast meetings. try it out. you won't be dissapointed.

Don't write this place off. Place is still awesome. They get slammed at breakfast time. So expect to wait a little bit for the food. We had great service, but we knew our server,and she took really good care of us and the people around us. We always consider this place for breakfast if we are not already headed to Yoli's! Had the chorizo and eggs and was super yummy. Wife had a smorgasbord of things and was satisfied! All the regulars here keep coming back, so I wouldn't stop coming here if I had 1 or 2 bad experiences out of the 100.

Best brewery in town and most popular. Parking straight up sucks. I usually park in the back behind the warehouse, but most likely you will be parking far away. All the beers are pretty famous already, but I specifically love the saison they have. They only have it on tap at the brewery. So it's a great treat for me when I go because they don't sell it any other way. Another favorite seasonal beer is the pumpkin porter, it's amazing! If you get the chance to grab one, grab 2 or 3 and a six pack. Food is really awesome here too! Never have been disappointed, and the staff is very accommodating and friendly. I  home brew my own beer so I love the warehouse atmosphere here eating and drinking while watching them make beer and staring at the huge conical fermenters. Everyone that's visits Tempe, must visit this unique brewery.

Arrived as they just opened, super quick service of course. Nobody there! They server was super friendly and nice, she got my order in right away. Booths are a little un comfy to sit in, but at least they have booths! Ordered an iced tea and it is brewed perfectly, and served with a lemon. Music is a little loud... Maybe they forgot to turn it down cause they just opened up. But I like loud music so I'm not complaining, I think others might. They have a nice little bar seating about 10. Looks like they have a decent selection of wine, beer and Pepsi products.  They have 2 crappy flat screen tv's that you can't hear. This is probably my 3rd time here, and I have yet to try something other then the this crust pizza because it's so delicious I don't want to order something I may not like... But next time I will broaden my horizons and test something else out.   I got my pizza in about 10 minutes. Greasy and delicious! I love how they serve the pizza on a rack that sits on the pizza pan, that way it doesn't just soak all of its grease up and get soggy.   I highly recommend this place to pizza lovers.

I used to come here a long time ago when I worked up here on rain tree and the 101.  It's been atleast 5-6 years. Best thing about this place is that it has not changed a bit with the quality of food and service. I really enjoyed this place, atmosphere, friendly service, quick food. We got here when it opened so it was not busy yet, but people started rolling in right away. I ordered my all time favorite teriyaki chicken and some crab puffs. Both were exceptional. I will be coming back regularly since I work in the area again. I recommend trying it out, it might not be your kind of place. But see for yourself, you shouldn't be dissapointed.

This place is delicious, period. Awesome atmosphere, great place to hang out outside. Fresh food from the farm. It's  no little pricey, but it's worth it if you can spend a little more on lunch, very reasonable compared to a lot of places that have really good food. It won't let you down. Go here and try it for yourself

Place is upscale no doubt. nothin much under 10 bucks. and it's nice inside. seat yourself. The hardwood chairs suck, very uncomfortable chairs. i recommend the booths!  I got the Bacon cheddar Burger with fries.   Place filled up really quickly, and since I'm only one person. I was forgotten quickly after i ordered... took awhile but the food finally came out, and the fries were cold. also had to go to the bar twice to get a refill on my iced tea. definitely felt very unimportant and lost all that hope of any decent service  won't recommend this place for it's service or food. the burger was ok, nothing special for the price paid.

Awesome grilled pork tacos, the beef ones are good to, but they can be on the fatty side most times. chicken delicious as well, but to me it doesn't top the pork. great salsa bar at every moreno's and awesome service. food always is hot and come out quickly. i love the horchata as well. i come here for a quick pit stop taco craving all the time!

What a great gem this place is! But cash only?! What a let down.... Had to go to circle k down the road to grab some cash. I love that this place is open earlier then most lunch spots(9:30), it's good for an early lunch in and out! Drive through! I took a look inside the place, and it is super duper clean, very impressive for a hole in the wall place like this. Very nice and sweet staff, fast service. Great fast food! It's too bad they don't have foot longs anymore. Great value for the price, I will be back! Don't forget cash!

Absolutely LOVE this place. Everything is fresh, everything is really awesome. I go here on a regular. Chicken alfredo pasty with a side of alfredo sauce is amazing. Bannoffee pie is out of this world. Garlic oven chips are a perfect snack, and the tomato soup is to die for! The expansion of the chandler store is great! Always happy, even thiugh the service can get a little rediculous when its busy!

Arrived when it opened, but the doors were locked. so i called and dude said they are open right now! and he came outside to meet me, and locked himself out! lol. he opened the door for me, and on i went! very nice remodeled place by restaurant impossible. i have not watched the episode yet, and wanted to come here first before i watch to give it a more raw review. it feels nice and comfy. i ordered a pizza because of all the good reviews. and i have to admit, the pizza is good, yummy sauce, chewy soft yet has a crunch to it. i like the basil leaves on it, and the wood fire taste. but i'm sorry it will never top Grimaldis Pizza... and honestly it was a little to burnt for me, tasted burnt. i'm sure the other dishes are awesome. but they just opened for lunch so i'm sure it will get better. would prob come again. i would like to try some other dishes:) thank you sapori d'italia!

This place is very comfy, laid back vibe, serving only bottled beer and a full bar. The food is not bad. It's not very authentic, but your typical Mexican food. This place is really busy at night and it's a big hang out spot. I don't go here much, but never remember ever being disappointed in service or food.

My local bar within walking distance of my house. I used to come here quite a bit, it's a great watering hole. They have a great selection of beers and full bar. 2 pool tables, video games, jukebox. The only reason I stopped coming here so often is because of the kareoke every night. I get really tired if hearing other people sing every time I come to the place... They don't have it every night, but it's a lot. Outside seating is nice, other nights they have trivia and bingo. The food here though is just your regular bar food. Mostly all fried, some of its good some of it's not, kind of a hit or miss. But hey when your drinking and hungry, it's hits the spot.

Walked into a nice little establishment here, people are very friendly and service is prompt. Gina our server recommended the omelettes, but i decided to get the german baked pancake instead. It was amazing good! A little pricey at 10 dollars for a cake, then I had to get some bacon cause it doesn't come with anything.... Oh well. Solid food, good service. No real complaints, I will come back if I'm in the area. I really enjoyed the baked german pancake

What an awesome hole in the wall mom and pops lookin shop. I work nearby and had to try this little place out. Very small catering business that packs a HUGE punch. Food is excellent! Me and a friend ordered breakfast burritos and it was incredibly fresh and delicious. They have some outside seats, and a couple small tables inside. It's very personable so bring 1 or 2 people. Not good for groups to visit, but bring the catering to your group. Highly recommend. Go here and try it

Worst food I have ever had. Not even edible. Saw some people eating the food and could see the looks of disgust when they had the fist bite. Service was awesome! They make sure your happy and taken care of. I don't know what happened to this place but it used to have great food. Now the menu sucks with a bunch of flatbread tasteless none sense . Not to mention the cook was super pissed off making the food and treating customers with ignorance. Must have not been having a good night, don't let the guy with the Afro make your food(major bummer). We had to go get a pizza down the street and bring it back cause the food was so gross here and we were here to watch some friends play in a couple of the bands. The place has great music and great local shows. Bartenders are awesome. Place is fun. Don't waste your money on the food.

Super Hipster, and awesome healthy yummy eats. great fresh drinks, and a total casual place to be.... only downside, no A/C... so it's super hot, when it's super hot outside, because it's basically outside and inside a warehouse. loved the place though, had a great time!

I wanted to give this place a better review.... But I'm just going to be blunt, short....not to sweet. I ordered the meatloaf sandwich, my brother ordered the prime rib sandwich. They were good. But really dry. We got our first drinks, and food in normal time.... But no service after that, we were forgotten about until she brought us a bill. We really wanted to order more things and tell her how are food was... But she neglected us. Super poor service, dry food..... Make sure you order everything, plus a side of gravy before she puts your order in. Because after you get your food..... No telling when she is coming back.

First thought is where do I park?! I parked out front then realized they had parking out back as well so I pulled around into the alley and parked in the back, came in through the back door. Place was empty, ugly. But very pleasantly surprising. My order was taken by a very nice lady that spoke English and Spanish! I read all the great reviews on the tacos so I had to try some. Got 3 asada tacos and 3 pork tacos. Came out very hot! Aye the pork first, lots of good flavor in there. They give you all kinds of fixins for your tacos! Pork was very good. Then the asada tacos. They were ok, kind of bland so you need to flavor it up with everything. Still everything was very good, you can tell they have good quality meat and products. I will come back.

excellent bartender! nice place. the food is a hit or miss, some is good some is not, most of the specials, stay away from. get the menu food, it's much bettter, but still be choosy. the bagel sandwich is a must have breakfast sandwich! and the chicken parm sandwich special is a must stay away from not good sandwitch at all! but go try this place, it's cool. and go to the bar, you'll usually get excellent service especially if it's Bill!

very interesting:) but thats what i love about Chinese people and the way they run business! i lived in china for a couple years and this place brings me back. awesome service even though the whole family and my server was eating at the same time i was there. you can tell this family has close relationships and they prob eat here 3 times a day when it's not busy. also love how they enjoyed each other's company while laughing and talking with their mouths full! lol. you can tell they love the food they make and they put a lot of love into it.  the place is your normal traditional Chinese decor with lots of red making the place very lucky! each table is equipped with the must have SRIRACHA! you don't need to ask for chopsticks cause every table has a box full of them. these people are smart! everything is great!  i tried the steamed dumplings(pork) 7 dollars for mostly all the items on the menu. it was a good portion, but i could have ate 4 more or so... left kinda still hungry  The Dumplings were amazing, and this place is within walking distance from my house!  i will definitely come back.

I have been coming here since this placed opened. service was great at first, but now that they are getting really busy, you got to wait in line for awhile to get your food at busy times, service is ok. so expect to wait in line if it's busy. food is still great though, so i try and go when it's not busy at all, don't go at noon:)

My prime spot for eggs Benedict. Outstanding staff. Delicious food. Great atmosphere and music. Keep finding myself coming back all the time but never writing a review. I strongly recommend everyone to try this gem out. I'm sure you will find yourself coming back as well.

cool place! it's a gas station/gift shop/restaurant/car wash/bakery! crazy! i will say it is upscale and over priced for the gifts.  but it has a bakery with fresh coffee, and small baked goods! met with my wife here, we grubbed the pulled pork sandwiches. was not impressed at all. there were hard bits and chunks in our sandwiches, and it just wasn't very tasty, meat was over cooked and really chewy. Expected way better pulled pork. I'm sure the other food is great, but if you can't master pulled pork at a BBQ place. i don't think i will be coming back.

Like the Place! has some covered parking with a menu on it so you can decide what you want before you go in, pretty cool. has a drive thru as well. you can place big orders ahead of time and go through the drive thru and pick it up! how convenient. place has 1 register, so when the place is packed and the drive though is packed, they switch back and forth using the same register. A little annoying for customers and prob the register guy too! get another register! Peeps are friendly, service is great, they get people in and out quickly, so it seems ok. ordered the California Club, place was packed! food amazing, the Tea was amazing too! I'll go back for sure!

Loved this place! What a unique place to grab a sandwich, best thing of all i don't have to talk to anyone about what I want on my sandwich.. What I don't want blah blah blah.... Just give them the bag for the sandwich you want, fill out the ingredients, pay. And bam! Sandwich no questions asked. If you are looking for a good sub place and are close by, better stop at wich wich

Fast service, seat yourself. Got drinks right away, and ordered food right away. Place is nice and modern feeling. Smells good. Place has a patio and a bar. Best background oldies music! Not a fan of jalapeño Mac and cheese, but that's just me:) The jalapeño taste is not for me. But I'm sure people love it. The fries were fantastic. I ordered the brisket and it was amazing! Wife had the pulled pork sammy, and she loved it and almost ordered another! Over all good experience, we will be back regularly

Great Fresh Greek Food! alway friendly service, it's my top notch spot for a gyro if i'm in the area. family owned and operated. And you can tell they put love into the food. it's a great hole in the wall place to visit or get it to go.  Newly remodeled, super clean and comfy. I love this place. The food and service has never let me down for a second.   Stop by and support this amazing locally owned business!

Food was ok here. The first round of food I got was really cold, literally cold. First time I have ever sent something back to get the same thing again. It kind of scares me getting food after complaining, but they have an open kitchen. So I really felt ok with doing it this time. The next plate of food was good and hot.  Service is good to average. I sat at the bar with my friend, noticed only female servers and bartenders at the place. It is full of dudes gawking at all of them while ordering breakfast... Almost  creepy. You can tell all the girls here are so used to it they just have these fake smiles and tiring looks on there faces. Anyway they did have baileys and coffee, outside seating, wheat toast.... Which for some reason is rare here in old town Scottsdale. Atmosphere was really nice and modern. They need to work on the food being cold situation, I guess you can't really do anything about all the creeps:) might not come back unless someone else wants to go

Me and my wife used to love this place, it used to have such awesome burgers! i really enjoyed the Rodeo Stuffed Burger. it has bacon and cheese in the meat! Now its sad to say they don't put the love that they used to into the food, and things have been going downhill from our point of view. We do keep going back hoping it's like it was when it started out. But i'm sorry we are done with this place. they used to have a super nice lady that worked there that is gone now:( . we went there one day  and it was really sad to go there and see a sign that read...Closed during the summer. so we went back again for lunch, and it was closed for lunch too! it opens at 5pm now, i wonder how much business has gone down now. well we plan to go another day for dinner.  so finally dinner time! super excited to redeem this place! when i looked through the window,  all the staff is hanging out, sitting down with the owner. all the lights are off except for a select few making it really gloomy and dull. As we walk in, the staff scrambles to their feet and gets to work immediately. a little odd and unprofessional. The place was DEAD, nobody there to eat, drink, or anything. just completely dead. As we walk in, the lady yells "sit wherever you'd like!" we sit down, order drinks. We start looking around to see the changes made and noticed a full bar with about 6 beers on tap, crazy! why? because there's no bar. It's a full bar, without the actual bar. also the decor had a lot of propaganda of alcohol and beer now mixed with nice framed pictures? it just didn't jive. it'e nice, but at the same time its not. it's confusing. i also couldn't help but notice that the server mentioned nothing about the drinks, or if they had any specials, when happy hour is, anything! she failed to sell us or mention to us what looks like now the most important money making item in the place, alcohol! anyway. we ordered burgers. because they were so awesome at one point in time. she mentioned a 15 minute wait instead of the previous 30 minute wait from when we came before. we got the home made potato chips to go with them, and a friend got some fries with his. we also ordered the pretzel with cheese. the regular burger was partially cooked, partially not? the buns for the burgers went way down in quality over toasted and small. did not seem fresh at all. the home made chips were way over done like they just plopped them back into the fryer. my rodeo burger was cooked medium, lots of red meat, it seems as the quality of meat went down, it didn't taste good. or the cook just doesn't know what he's doing. the gorgonzola burger was cooked well done. and they didn't ask us how we wanted our burgers cooked, so when we got them and they were all different, it was concerning. the pretzel and cheese was a horrible loaf like pretzel that was microwaved, with jalapeño cheese. it was hard on the bottom and was just gross. we asked the lady how the pretzels were, and she said "we have had no complaints about them!" thats why we got them. and of course we we're starving! so we gobbled it up and held our noses!  45 dollars later and still kind of hungry we actually went somewhere else for yummy snack. 45 dollars seems like a lot of money for 3 burgers 3 fountain drinks and a pretzel.   all said and done, we won't be back. it's sad to see this business not do good. we really want to like this place, but just can't. if we get a wild hair we might try a pizza to go if this place lasts longer then a year.

Great beer, and super clean place! The only place in arizona that serves true German das dunkel brew. This place has a lot of character and friendly people that hang out here as soon as the place opens at 3pm. Reasonable prices and friendly people. Free popcorn! Lots of great beers to chose from. Clean bathrooms.... Everything is great here. I would like to see them open around lunch time, and maybe see them get some food up in this place, appetizers only would be perfect. Can't wait to come back and get a growler!

Sat at the bar and had a really great experience. Awesome beer, great smell in the air, a couple pigs rotating in the middle, roasting and smoking above a fire. Had awesome food, delicious curly fries. Got some fried Oreos, yum! I will bring the wife next time:)

Not bad, not amazing either. Walked into the dead place on a Friday mid morning for a quick breakfast. Was waited on and ordered quickly. I see lots of bad service comments. In my experience the service was excellent, no up sales. Prompt service. Just order food and get it in 10 min. Perfect! Recommend

Wife Ordered the french toast with Ham, scrambled eggs and a biscuit on the side.... lol. they serve REAL chocolate milk! not milk with chocolate syrup:) even though i like it too. place is nice and has an open ceiling. loved the food! it was super yummy. definitely will come back here again. we got our check without asking for it, and were on our way when we wanted to be. great place.

Wow! Amazing coffee, amazing smoothies, amazing everything! I haven't had the pleasure of trying everything yet, but I'm sure I will... Came to the market for the first time to buy some ambrosia apples for some cider I'm going to make. 59 cents a pound! Then a friend had to buy us drinks here. He created a monster

place is small, new, and needs business. was working in the downtown area and found this place when i tried to go to a closed down quiznos....anyway saw only 2 reviews, i thought i'd try it out for myself. i like finding places that haven't been around for to long. and in need of more review.   i tried the pulled pork sliders, they were only 2.50$ so i grabbed a couple. good sliders, the pork melts in your mouth, and was cooked perfectly. wasn't over flavorful so i doused it with some BBQ sauce, the hot bbq sauce was really yummy, not to spicy, just the right bite.  the place does not have fountain drinks of any kind. so you have to buy a can or bottle of soda or water:( so i bought 2 waters... dude definitely needs a fountain drink machine and some iced tea. nobody wants to buy 2 or 3 drinks when they eat in.  Main thing is that the food is good. maybe not amazing, but it was good. i will have to come back and try something else. ribs looked good, chicken was recommended. i don't like the fact that everything is being kept warm under heat lamps. but i will try it out again if i'm in the area. it's more like a catering kind of place, or take out place. everything is packed up to go wether your eating in or not.   met the owner, he lives upstairs:) said he smokes all his meats fresh every morning when he wakes up. the place just needs some notice. maybe some more specials to get people in. theres a couple pics i posted while i was sitting in the corner. thats the owner in the pic. really nice guy!  give this spot a chance and go try it, get some catered to your office peeps. i think you will enjoy it.

Love this spot! Never over crowded but steadily busy. The server is always the same when I come in and does a great job managing his customers. I'm a sucker for eggs Benedict and I get it every time i come here. It will make your taste buds dance! It's truly delicious. Great background music, always oldies. Place is dim and cozy. I like to come here and do my paperwork for work and relax, they won't kick you out and you never feel like your taking up space.  They have beer here and all types of beverages. Robbyrob recommended.

I really like this place. They always have a good selection of craft brews. I love there boneless chicken wings, specifically the teriyaki. Pretzel board is good except for the cheese, it tastes like meat.... Kind of like a bunch of lil' smokies were cooked in it. ruins the cheese if you'd ask me. I do come here often. The music is good and there are a lot of tv's. Don't get the ribs tips... Or a side of veggies.... But like I said I do like this place and plan on coming back

Amazing awesome beer with lots of beards roaming around. Great vibes, great good,  with exceptional service. I love the saison they have everyone once in awhile, I highly recommend getting it if they have it on tap. First time here I grabbed the az trail burger. Very tasty!  Get the Home made chips or the fries, neither are disappointing. I get growlers on a regular basis. I love the atmosphere here. Loud inside and very peaceful on the patio, I like both! Second time here got the duck fat fries smothered with pulled pork and beer cheese, and the meatloaf sliders. Both were very delicious, but the pulled pork fries(forgetting what they are really called).... Specifically the pork, lacked in flavor and was a bit water logged. Seems like the fries and beer cheese made up for the flavor of the dish. They just need to season it a lot more or marinade it..... I give this place 5 stars anyway. Because I just can't get enough

While visiting the market and other stores around, me and a buddy grabbed a sandwich at this amazing sub shop. We got the special, had some kind of mystery meat in it, all kinds of fresh veggies, and by surprise! it was very tasty. Would like to explore more of the items in the store, I will definitely come back!

Yangste is truly missed. This  new place needs to produce way better food. It does not even compare to the bistro it once was. I'm very sad. The orange chicken used to be amazing, whole white meat chicken with a delicious battered crispy texture. Sad to say it doesn't even compare anymore. This place was a milestone in Chinese food here in chandler.... Now it is just a memory of how awesome it used to be.

35 min early, 8th person in line! Everyone brought there Starbucks today. Bring a friend to talk to while you wait, or look like a phone creep! Like me! Looks like the crowd really shows up at 10:45, so get here atleast 30 minutes early to get a good spot in line and a parking spot in the lot. Never been here, but anxiously waiting to pound down some brisket. Tuesday is supposedly the lightest day for them, so come on Tuesdays!

The place is nice, a little in organized but they were busy for a Sunday morning. As should be expected. Arrived at 11:10, seated at 11:15, ordered food and got our drinks by 11:20. So far, so good. Place has music, mostly oldies. It can be a little noisy when it's busy. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I Always see everyone cleaning. Of course my wife had to point at the cob webs in the corners, haha. The wife ordered the colonel, I ordered the copper queen skillet. Got our food at 11:42... 22 minute wait until we ordered. Not bad. We finished our food at 12:00. Got our check at 12:04. Cashed out and left at 12:06. I will be coming back! I like this place.

Wow is this place poppin! We arrived and the place was packed. There was a 5 to 10 minute wait, and we were super hungry. We sat down in 5 minutes! I didn't want to come here when the place opened and thought I'd give them some time to work out the new business kinks. I'm glad I did, cause looking at all the bad reviews and good ones had me very curious about this place. But anyway the service was really awesome, the girl asked all the right questions and took down our whole order... The only thing was she sold herself short a little bit by not following through with all the awesome questions she had... For instance my wife ordered the chicken Alfredo, she said it came with veggies and my wife said she would like them on the side. well, we never got them at all. The other thing is she asked if we wanted our salads before our food, and said yes! Definitely.... And of course our food came out with our salad, equaling our food to be cold after we ate our salad. Food was not hot! Probably the biggest complaint. It was slightly warm though, and atleast it was good... I warned the staff but I didn't want them to take my food. Was only trying to inform them. The garlic bread served with our food was only 1 little piece, and really soggy with butter, barely toasted, no crunch to it at all! I asked for more bread, and she brought me 1 more slice of sogginess.....oh well, me and my wife are extremely picky, and like lots of bread to go with our New Orleans pasta and chicken Alfredo. Honestly we really liked the food even though the little things didn't add up very nicely. We will come back! They are always super slammed so I could tell the waitress was overwhelmed and the kitchen staff wasn't working with her to really make the customers extremely happy. You can tell this place is going to have a lot of criticism, but I recommend trying it out and see if it's for you, maybe give it another month for things to slow down a little bit, but ultimately the food is good, service is good, decor is nice.... Place is loud, but what do you expect from a new business thats just jam packed with curious Arizonans.

What is all the hype about at this place?! Nothing! I thought this was some sort of fancy burger place, but as soon as you walk in, it's your average fast food burger joint. Place is misleading in my opinion. The fries were soggy and worse then regular fast food places, burgers were not cooked deliciously and dry. Milk shakes are not made with real ice cream and the chocolate one is over loaded with Hershey's syrup. Blah!   The major disappointed was not only the food, but they cannot handle a rush of customers. We walked in when it was moderately busy. No line. The kid at the counter who took our order was super slow and no help at all. No suggestions, no up sales, just super lazy with his customer service skills. We sat down and waited about 20-30 minutes to get our food while hearing people yell at each other in the kitchen, constantly calling out a servers name over and over again. Very annoying and unprofessionally loud. Not good. No love. Don't go here. Wait at least 6 months until they get there staff straightened out.  On another note! The concept of this place is great! It's a nice clean place. Love the ideas of a lot of different burgers and specials. I like the menu.   But you need good cooks, loyal employees. Good service to execute. They are not at all there yet. I'll go back on the next blue moon and review again.

Walked into the Cherry Tree smokehouse today, place was empty except for 1 table at 11:45. not a good sign so far. no real direction on what to do when you enter except to go to the front desk and wait for someone to show up. looks very under staffed. I only see 2 people running around. this is lunch time! any good place for lunch has a lunch rush and prepares for it! i asked for a sample of the brisket and it took 10 minutes just for him to have the other guy slice it and finally give it to me. there was no line behind me when i ordered the sample... and when i finally got the sample i had 10  people behind me. so i ordered my food before i got the sample in hope to help them process these people quicker, but it was just simply understaffed. then sadly i was not impressed by the flavorless chewy brisket. does not even come close to little miss BBQ brisket. finally,  around 12 a lady showed up to help them, just in time for the rush. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a combo. what is the combo you ask? not sure. had to get back in line after my order to figure out what comes with the combo and for goodness sakes give me my drink! i thought that was standard. then dude gives me a can of Dr. Pepper. little disappointed that there is no refills. $11.86 for a combo and i get a tiny little bite sized looking corn bread, some cheap chips, and a can of soda. where is the value? my pulled pork sandwich looked like it got the crap beat out of it, then grilled to warm it up for serving. not saying thats what they do... it just looks like the most haggard pulled pork sandwich I've ever seen. so i finally started eating and the pork was dried out, so i rescue it with a bunch of BBQ sauce and it was decent. not flavorless, but needs a lot more flavor. i did eat it all so it was edible. really wanted to like this place but it lacks flavor and customer service. i saw all the poor reviews for this place and had to see for myself. so i conclude that it's over priced and the value is not there. it has potential, so i'll visit back in about 6 months to see how they are doing. good luck Cherry Tree you have a nice little place.

Love love love this place just as much as the restaurant Welcome Diner. Every donut is unique, delicious, and fresh. The Friendly up beat staff is on point with service and you can tell they love what they do. As soon as you walk in you feel the warmth and inviting atmosphere sucking you deep into a food coma. Highly recommended!
