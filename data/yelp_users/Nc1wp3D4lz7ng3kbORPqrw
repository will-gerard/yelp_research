Best  church ever!  My whole family loves it at CCV. The worship is incredible!! The people are wonderful. For us most importantly the teaching pastors do an amazing job at breaking scripture down, painting a picture, making it relatable to current times, and my favorite helping you understand how to use the Word and actually apply it to our lives.  I always feel refreshed, renewed, and a more prepared to take on the week and all the uncertainties that are a part of life.  I would not be able to cope with life carrying around the greif of losing my sister and cousin so young if it wasnt for #1 Jesus but also my home away from home which is CCV.

This is my favorite VS location. They have the friendliest most helpful staff. The sales girl Alex is fabulous I would want her as an employee if I still had my retail business!  Definitely a lot more fun less stressful and frustrating than shopping at the Arrowhead mall location.

Best Yoga place I have been to by far! Love the incredible teachers.  Love the look of it and the calming relaxing atmosphere.  Wish it had at least one more shower but the fellow yogis are very considerate of each other which is so great so its not a big deal really.  After trying a few places ive learned to never go anywhere else!

Let me start by saying I love Kohls! I love the products, i love the sales, its good quality for the price. This store is also always clean. The rating is for service. I have not once left feeling good about the service i was provided and im there quite a bit. You have to search hard for someone to help you, customer service is always rude no matter who you get. Ive found employees huddles together talking before. I like that they usually have our sizes otherwise it would be worth the further drive to bell where the staff is a lot more helpful and friendly.

Went for a gel manicure and pedicure and polish chipped less than 48 hours later. When I called to tell them about it they would not do anything about it because i didnt call w/in 48 hours. Also when we picked our colors we were never told it was extra for the color we wanted didnt even know until asking after i was given my receipt.   After mentioning it was our first time and that im sure fixing a couple chips in polish would be worth their while if they want a returning customer it still did not matter to them. After giving them the opportunity to make it right they did not so buyer/customer beware.

Great gym!! So comfortable,  people are wonderful and very helpful. There is something for everyone whether you just want to do your thing or even be social and fun during a workout with the classes and events. Tge owner is fabulous!! They really care about helping people and the community which is refreshing and wonderful.  Definitely not your cold corp type gyms. More of a small family business feel which is great!
