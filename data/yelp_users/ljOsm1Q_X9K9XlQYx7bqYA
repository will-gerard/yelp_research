Great lunch! I had the Asian salad and slice of the day. Really beautiful place. I'll be back. My friend had pepperoni pizza and Cesar salad and said it was the best pizza ever. The service is not the greatest but can forgive that.

The worst experience ever! I called about a week before I needed 2 dz cupcakes for my sons 10th birthday party. I didn't even flinch when the girl on the phone told me that it would be over $91 for the order because I assumed that I would be paying for a special and superior product. I told the girl on the phone that I would be picking up the order between 11 am and noon about 7 days later.   I came at 11 am to pick up the order. The place was not open and after waiting a couple of minutes I had to call the store to tell them I was out front. When they finally opened up I was greeted by a store that was not prepped for the day and the employee looked like she just rolled out of bed. I gave the woman my order name and she went to the back to get my order. She returned and told me that my order was not made because a new hire had not completed the order the night before. She requested that I wait and she would make the cupcakes for me...$91 cupcakes made in 15 minutes. I told her that I would be back as I had to pick up something at Frys. That something being cupcakes that I ordered from Fry's for my son's classroom- I thought to order cheaper cupcakes $7.99 dz  and the extra expensive special cupcakes for his actual family birthday party. Guess what, Fry's had my cupcakes ready.   Anyway, I go back to MOB and she hands me 1 dozen cupcakes that are not what I ordered. I explain to her that these are not what I ordered. She goes in the back and finds my actual  order and tells me that she will make the cupcakes and that on the order it states that I would be there between 11 and noon and since it was 11:50 she had 10 minutes to get me my order together. I explained to her that the whole experience had been ruined and that I no longer wanted the cupcakes. She explained that they do not offer refunds and she would have to talk to her manager who was on the phone. I gave her my phone number and told her to have her manager call me. As I was leaving the woman behind me requested her order, which was the order that had been given to me on this second visit. So if I hadn't come in first that lady would have had to wait for MOB to make her order too!!!   The manager called me and apologised. She was really nice and sounded like she felt bad. She said that the owner wouldn't refund my money but would give me a discount, a refund of the custom cupcake fee, which equaled about $10. At this point I didn't have any other options for my son's birthday so I took it, an hour later I picked up the cupcakes. They refunded my $10.   Really the worst part of this whole experience is that by the end of the day I felt like such an idiot for spending so much on some stupid cupcakes. I really expected something great and special. The cupcake packaging was flimsy and cheap. The cupcakes themselves were nothing special. I could have done the custom decoration. I can't even vent to friends and family because I don't want anyone knowing that the more than ordinary, less than extraordinary cupcakes they ate at my son's birthday cost me $91. What an idiot I am. Never again!

I love love love ice cream! Sparky's has a large selection! I got to try a couple of samples before choosing the Nutella Banana Bread! It was so good by itself but I had some strawberries mixed in! Loved every bite. I checked in on foursquare and got a free waffle cone too! My pals and I sat outside at  one of their tables! Love the weather this time of year! Great ice cream, great times and great friends. Can't beat it!!
