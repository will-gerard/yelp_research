My heart is still trying to get back into regular running mode.. The portions from this place are insane.  Food is delicious, decor looks like a dirty truck stop.    The omelets are INSANE, bigger than my head.. speaking of things bigger than my head.. the Sausage patties are in fact that large.    Service is what you'd expect, pretty good for an overworked crew.

I like to admit right on if I got a super cheap deal via Travelocity/Expedia/Etc... and this is another one that I snagged for 50 bucks a night..    At the price mentioned above.. it was great! At another price it'd still be good.  The location is pretty great, walkable area, seemed safe, close to most things downtown, etc... The lobby is cute, it's styled to look a bit  like a patio with outdoorish furniture in very bright colors.   The room was also pretty great!  The beds were comfy, great pillows, nice and spacious.   Overall very modern, clean, and a hotel I'd stay at in the future!

Wow.  That's all I've got to say really.. other than GO!    There isn't anything negative to say about both of my experiences here!  I love the pizza, love the people, the desert is to DIE for, and the service is stellar!   I started off with Sweet Potato Fries, which sadly had some spice on them that I didn't enjoy, as quickly as they saw I wasn't eating them they removed from the bill and offered any other appetizer for me.  I decline and waited for the pizza to arrive..   Wait the 45 minutes, get the deep dish, and be in heaven!  I'm a classic Pep and Cheese guy, but saw a number of others with stuff in them that looked equally delish.    Finally, do not leave without having the cookie desert, it's phenomenal!  I'd fly back to PHX just for this cookie!

Wow.. talk about a mess.  I recently had the ...joy or something like that... to fly in, cart a number of friends around, and fly out of this airport..   When I landed the first thing I noticed was the fact that the airport looked like it hadn't been updated since about 1992.. I was waiting for someone to pull out a huge cell phone to make a call.. it was also about 85 degrees inside.. hello AC?   My next encounter with this lovely place was picking up my friends, as long as you fly United or Continental I've got no complaints, because they are located in Terminal 2 (where the hell is terminal 1?  it goes 2, 3, 4) but if you happen to fly into one of the other 2 getting to and from them is a mess.    One day I had to drop a person off at 3, then go back to 2, and finally end at 4.  I think I looped the airport 18 times to try and find the correct route to do this..   The only positives I've got about this place are the free Wi-Fi, a billion food options, and the ease of security.

Why would I go to the aviary on Easter weekend ?!?!?! thats all I kept thinking as the children ran around my feet... it was still a good time, but i prefer non-holiday weekends.   My favorite part of the entire place is Penguin Point, it's so fun to watch the zany penguins.    In the past I've done the trainer for a day program and got to work alongside the staff for about 8 hours, behind the scenes as well as interacting with visitors.  Very fun thing to do if you have the time/money.  You are able to pet the penguins (they bite) nuzzle with flamingos (they put kelp in your hair) and prepare fruit kabobs for the parrots (i wasn't going close enough to see what they would do to me).

Give it more than a glance... At first you think, ehh!  Gross old man bar.. then you realize it's actually the most awesome place to dance, drag, and enjoy the night in PHX.    Charlies is country, but not all that often, I think they realize that you can't be a full on country bar and expect a ton of customers, but they do have nights tailored towards that.  I went there probably 6 times out of a 10 day trip...   The DJ's do a great job of playing a mix of new, recent, and older dance music.  The drag queens are hilarious. The boys *correction Men* are HOT.  and finally... the Bartenders know how to serve a drink and do it right!

Where to begin... hmmm how about a gay bar in a shopping center?  What the hell is wrong with Scottsdale???   The entire experience with BS West was.. well BS.  I think the easiest way to explain my frustration is just bullet points, otherwise I'll get carried away...  *Parking - A freaking mess.  *Staff - Rude as crap.  *Capacity - I understand wanting to make money off the cover.. but having wayyyy too many people inside there is not fun, and also just not safe, they HAD to be over capacity the night I went.  *Customers - ugh. Suburban Hell.  It was cute annoying little twinks, their very annoying str8 girlfriends, and some awkward housewives who stumbled in on the way home from Applebees.   All in all, I guess this would be an ideal club for someone who's... 18-22.  A twink would love this place, but I've apparently passed over that point in life.. I like my gay bars alittle grittier, the biggest issue was the shopping mall feel for me.

I'd give it 1 star if it wasn't for the headliner who works here...   The building itself is nice enough, the decor is ok, the staff was attentive, but the client√®le made me want to jump out the door and run!  Upon walking in the door I wondered if I was in the right place, all I could see were lesbians and really annoying straight girls celebrating Birthdays/Bachelorette parties.    The one side of the bar is the Show Room, where miss Barbra does her thing, which is awesome, other side was dead.  I imagine maybe it would get better as the night went on.. I hope..   I'd go back, but not the ideal place when there are a number of other great ones to hit in the area.

Really ?!?! People like this place.    I was told to come here because of how similar it is to The Corner Pocket in NOLA... well to be honest. It's NOTHING like the Corner Pocket in my mind.  The Corner Pocket was fun, trashy (in an attractive way), and left a little to the imagination.    Real Luck is gross, trashy (as in the building might fall at any moment), and left NOTHING to your imagination (which to be honest from the ugliness of the dancers is fine... because i'm sure my imagination would have been worse)    Drinks were cheap. Staff was sketch. Dancers looked like they were on a number of hallucinogens

A sad sad place.. makes the Hawk (in CLE) look like a vegas style nightclub.  The 941 has all the potential to be great - ok decor, cute staff, dance floor, but it didn't connect for me.    I went twice in one night hoping that maybe I was just there during the wrong time of night.. but it didn't get any better as it go later, just more empty and more sad than before.    And to top it off.. they have the annoying shot things on their bottles, no overpour there.. so no good tips for the bartender.

I love breakfast/brunch, and I've gotta say I found a place that really fits me! Scramble was everything I was looking for!   The food is great, the people are nice, the location is adorable, and decor is fun/modern.    I also like the way you order, there isn't pressure to wait for a server to come to you, you can get your refills as needed, and enjoy your experience without hoping that you get a good person and not a server having a bad day.

If you want to see, be seen, or just imagine yourself among the stars at a poolside party then this is the place to be!    I came to the W for special event, so the top area was closed off to our guests only, and I didn't explore the rest of the hotel at all, but this part was great.  If you are the type of person who enjoys ambiance, atmosphere, and a party atmosphere this would be the place for you.  Yes the drinks are pricey, but that's to be expected, it's worth it!   I just wish that people would behave better when they are in places like this, it's a very nice, swanky place, and those around me acted like rednecks at the farm.
