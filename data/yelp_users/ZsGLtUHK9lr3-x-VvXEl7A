This place is awesome! The employees are always super friendly and helpful. If you love shopping online for alternative clothing, this place is for you! Honestly it's so hard to find cool things like this in AZ. I love this place since I don't have to buy the things online it's right at my convenience.   I especially love this place because you can order something they don't have and ship it to the store for you. I bought a purse there but it wasn't in stock and the owner got in touch with the whole seller and was able to pull strings and get me my amazing eyeball purse.   This place has everything! From brands like kreepsville666, demonia, tuk creepers, and so many more cool brands. Not only that but they have a band tee wall that stretches across the store and have a awesome sticker wall with every band you can think of. Such a cool place!

If I could give no stars I would. This place is terrible. The staff, the quality, the store itself is just terrible. I've tried bringing clothes in and they just threw my clothes in a bin and set it aside for an hour. I'm not exaggerating, it literally took them an hour to look at THREE items.  The clothes I was going to donate were name branded and only worn one or twice. I thought they would accept seeing all the other junky clothes they had. Nope, my weren't "in style". Yeah okay! Half their clothes are three years outdated. I feel like they don't accept quality clothing. Everything there is old, stained, overly worn, and smelly. Everything about that store just gives off bad energy.   NEVER GO IN!!! Unless you want terrible service and a funky smell up your nose for the rest of the day.

I seriously love this place!   This place has amazing coffee. So much cheaper and tastier than Starbucks. I go to this location because I go to GCU. The staff is always so friendly in the mornings and great vibes. I love going here in the morning because with their good energy it brings me a good morning. Say what you want but that's how I feel. If you're ever on camelback and need some coffee, go there asap!

I love to try new sushi places and let me tell you this place wasn't a mistake! The decor is so cute lol I love the feel of the whole place. The sushi is made in front of you which is nice to see. The restaurant is nice and relaxing. The employees were super nice!   Went there on a girls night and was treated so well! We were given complementary edamame and oranges (don't know if they do that to everyone). My friends and I bought 3 rolls. Shrimp tempura, California roll, and Phoenix roll. Best choice! Not only that the price was reasonable. Usually sushi is a little pricy but at Sushi San the price was right lol  I would recommend this to everyone who likes sushi and I plan on going there again!

This store is AMAZING! Everyone there is so friendly and social. If you're the type of person who starts conversations with people then the staff is for you. They're so helpful and willing to tell you about their products. They know what they're talking about and find joy in it! I like that in a store; where a employee shows interest into their job! I really love their all natural products. I'm not a vegan or anything but they have really good stuff for people with color treated hair. You don't get all those nasty chemicals like normal hair products do. I always feel so clean and refreshed after using their products.   Every time I go I always walk out satisfied and with a smile on my face!
