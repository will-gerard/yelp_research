Yum. Signature Mama all the way. This is a great place, no matter how you slice it.

For the most part, I'm a huge fan of Trader Joes. They have high quality food, at very fair prices. One of my favorite things is that all of their food is non-gmo (impossible to find anywhere else), doesn't have added hormones and as few preservatives as possible. My only wish is that would stop using canola oil in their products. This particular store is pretty good, most of the employees are great.

Really decent food, with good ingredients - which is rare these days. The sandwiches are pretty good, but their soup is amazing. Garlic Tomato or Butternut Squash are my 2 favorites. They have more vegetarian options than most places if you're looking for that. On of my go-to lunch spots, for sure!

Good food, great owner, service and ambiance. After being there once, our server remembered our orders - and we didn't return for our second visit for months. I love that we felt like a regulars almost immediately. They know our kids and are always warm, friendly and inviting. If you're looking for a place to feel like you're noticed, this is the place for you. :)  And I highly recommend the strawberries, banana and nutella crepe - yum!!

My cut is great - and the color and highlights in my hair are unbelievably awesome. I have a hard time finding hairdressers, but Marilo knows what she is doing, is extremely personable and charming and her rates are reasonable. I highly recommend her!!

Gotta love Yoli's. Friendly atmosphere and located in a cute courtyard. Since the first time I went, I felt like a regular and I really like that. If you're impatient and looking for the fastest service, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a warm, pleasant, relaxing place with EXCELLENT french toast. This is definitely the place. :)

I wanted to like this place... but yuck. I could smell the old, nearly rotten oil when we walked in the door and I kept hoping I was maybe imaging it. We ordered to-go and when we got home, I couldn't eat the burger and the fries didn't taste good due to the bad oil. Only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the kids working there were really trying hard to impress and do a good job.

Gabe was quick, professional, upfront and honest. He came out the same day to save us (all of our toilets were clogged!). Oh, and he was EARLY... What more could you ask for in a plumber? I highly recommend him and I would not hesitate to call him again. Thanks Gabe. :)

I visited Sassy's for the first time yesterday. It was the bright spot of my day! I had a wonderful red velvet cupcake with fresh, yummy frosting and a cup of coffee. As soon as we sat down, the attentive staff offered us fresh coffee (twice). Looking around at everyone's salads and sandwiches I almost wish I'd eaten lunch there. I'd say, give Sassy's a shot. I walked away a happier woman.

GGH is my favorite cleaning team on the valley. They are always on time, professional and meticulous. I highly recommend the oven cleaning as a add on, we did one for Thanksgiving this year and they did an amazing job. I am thankful to have a great cleaning service that uses natural products that are safer for my family!
