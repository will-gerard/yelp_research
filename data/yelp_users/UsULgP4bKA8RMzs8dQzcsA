Cool and Creative Names and ingredients how could you not love this place!  I had the "Who's the Turkey" which  was, Grilled turkey breast dressed with cream cheese and cranberry relish with fresh mixed greens, alfalfa sprouts, sliced pickles, and red onion wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla  with no onions(see pics)  You could put cream cheese and cranberry on anything and it would suddenly become the best thing you ever tasted!  I really  liked it although I'm not sure I prefer tortilla over bread......it was a nice change, I Guess I'm just not used to it.    Especially since a certain Yelper We all know and Love got me worrying about Hydrogenated oils......As far as Ive seen most tortillas (flour) contain it......unfortunately I couldn't get the scoop here...they had already thrown out the boxes that list the ingredients, said I could call in on Wednesday  to confirm.  I'm really hoping it's not listed because that would spoil the healthy kick they've got going on.  Would it stop me from eating here though.....probably not, I'd just get a salad or a rice bowl instead.

Perfect Day, Perfect Brunch, Perfect Place.  Yes that would be at the Coronado Cafe.   Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and was pleased to see that they offered brunch as well as lunch.   Every thing sounded so goo it was hard to decide but I ended up getting a brunch item, the Crabby Benedict (see pics) which was two poached eggs over toasted focaccia, topped with blue crab, avocado, & hollandaise, served with caf√© potatoes & fresh fruit.   Our food arrived fresh and on HOT Plates, I Seriously LOVED every bite and my daughter had The Biscuits and Gravy (see pics) and she cleaned her plate as well.   We sat outside and really enjoyed the patio, I'll have to go back to check out the inside on another Perfect Day!

Entertaining out of town guests has never been easier!  My Girlfriend who I'll call the "The green thumb goddess" has a garden almost as impressive as this one.So imaging her her delight when I agreed to her accompany her on this little adventure. (see pics)  I'll have to admit I enjoyed it more that I expected I would.  I won't be redundant with my review as there is so many already, but this is a place everyone should visit at least once before it gets too hot, and if you happen to be there during butterfly season then your in for a real treat!   You should also try to take a trip when it's open at night so you can see the garden all lit up!   *wear comfy shoes; this place is bigger than you think *bring lots to drink; or lots of money to drink *enjoy the gift shop garden center; you can buy your own cacti * take your time to bask in the glory that is the Sonoran Desert

Very Cute and Cozy Place!   The Food was AMAZING!  Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon!   I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics)   Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious!   I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!

After hearing my sister who lives in California tell me about this place for weeks after she saw it on the Food Network, I was finally in the vicinity and able to check it out.   It's a very small place, Very Small. Cozy.   Lots to choose from on their chalkboard menu, we were greeted upon entry and told to come up and order when we were ready.  We ordered a ceaser salad, the Risotto Balls, Delicious balls of risotto with mozzarella cheese inside then lightly rolled in bread crumbs and fried with a side of marinara. Fresh Pasta Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and Gnocchi with Tomato Cream Sauce.  I thought the prices seemed a little high, but honeslty after tasting the food I didnt care.  First of all everything came out piping HOT, including other diners dishes, you could see the steam rising throughout the restaurant!  My husband always orders Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and he said this was his Favorite and best he's ever had!  I had a few bites and  it was truly delicious with the fresh pasta and roasted pulled chicken and just the right amount of sauce, it had great flavor!  My Gnocchi was no exception, those tasty little morsels of cheesy mashed potatos if you will and the Tomato Cream sauce was excellent as well although I wish there had been just a tad more sauce.  Our ceasar salad was large enough to share, fresh greens dressed just right but unfortunately no croutons or parmesean?  The bread and butter was really tasty too!  All in all, we had a great experience and would definitely return!

Everything was Amazing, I'm in LOVE Hard!   Shared a Cheese Course and a Bruschetta Plank.  My choice was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread and Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone (see pics)   Absolutely Heavenly! The Cheese, the Bread, OMG, words don't do it justice , just go!

I have been here a couple of times and just not written a review for this location.   Last time was great everything we ordered was delicious and fresh, this time not so much, at least as my food was concerned.   On a recent rip to California I visited a Cuban bakery and cafe where I had the most amazing potato balls, that's what they call them there, a mashed potato croquet slightly larger than a golf ball, filled with seasoned ground beef and flash fried and Oh SO Amazing and only .80cents each! WHAT! ;-)   So when I saw Christina's review describing these fabulous treats I wondered how I over looked them and decided to make my way over to Havana.   I have to say I was extremely disappointed, 2 golf ball sized, dried out potato balls for $6.50! (see pics) They were not even edible in my opinion.   I asked the waiter to take them away.  I also ordered the calamari (see pics)which I was not happy with either but since someone in my party kept eating it, it was a little hard to send back.  It was very heavy if that makes sense, the crust was so thick and I though it was a tad rubbery but what turned me off the most was the grayish greenish color...........I wasn't going to eat these either.

This is a great place to picnic, bring out of town visitors, bring the dog, even bring some obnoxious children. Just don't bring them all at the same time.  There are so many reviews, I'll just add a few quick things.  The soup and sandwiches are probably the better things on the menu(although the bread can be hard), I agree with the others who said the counter line does not flow well, especially if you need a refill. (bring your own chest of drinks) I've had several of the desserts and they were absolutely gross, especially the Pecan Pie ( I Make the Best) the blueberry pie used canned blueberry goo= Yuck, not impressed by the bread pudding or carrot cake either, the butternut squash creme brule' was quite tasty though.  Basically it's more about the scenery and having your own picnic, Heck you could even bring your own food if you wanted. In fact you should.  I haven't been to the back of the farm but I understand they have a breakfast restaurant with waiter service and a nice dinner place too, along with a few other shops.

Well what can I say, It's a dirty job but somebodys gotta do it! And Jiffy knows how to Lube me the right way~  Aside from the desperate up-selling they do every time I go in,(would you like a new air filter, wiper blades , tire rotation etc.) it really is quick and convenient.Their waiting room is pretty grungy though so thank goodness I don't have to stay long.  Along with the oil change they also top off all the fluids and put air in my tires, But what I really like is that they vacuum my floors and clean my windshield as part of the service and that bumps them up to 4 stars!

OK This is usually where I go for a car wash because it's convenient.  NO matter how many times I tell them not to mess with seat position they always do!  Also they never lock my floor mats back down after vacuuming???  I don't get it ,they know they unlocked them and moved them around ,why don't they have the decency to lock them back into place?  And my car is really never clean enough either, Why do I still waste my money you ask............... Well I'm not gonna wash the damn thing!  2* and half stars

I have been here once before today and thought it was OK.   Knowing that have a huge daily special for only $10 I thought it would be perfect to share with my daughter, I think it comes with 5 pieces of assorted sushi fish, a crunchy California roll, crab tempura and a stuffed shrimp egg roll thing plus soup and salad, definitely a lot of food!   That's what we planned on ordering until we sat down at the sushi bar and saw them pre-making the CA rolls and setting them off to the side on a large tray...UGH you know how I HATE pre made stuff!   I decided on a tuna/avocado roll and Val got a shrimp tempura roll, I also ordered a cucumber salad.   Well I'm much more for quality over quantity and Sakana seems to be the other way around, yeah they give you a lot but it's really not that great.   My tuna roll was OK, the Shrimp tempura roll was filled with an enormous amount of mayonnaisey Krab meat and my cucumber salad was a giant bowl, probably 3 cucumbers worth, of just plain cucumbers WTH?   I tried to explain to the guy making the sushi but he didn't understand my English because he spoke mainly Spanish and I don't think the waitress understood to clearly either when she returned to me with another bowl of less amount and less fresh cucumbers, plain again but with a drizzle of something foul.   There is much much better sushi to be had and I'm more than happy to pay for it elsewhere because Sakana's sushi isn't quality sushi to my standards.   But if your looking to fill up on mediocrity by all means pull up a chair.

I've never had a bad meal at any of the locations/states I've eaten at.  I don't drink beer but I enjoy the food.  I most always order the same thing "Mac and Cheese" no chicken, it comes with a decent house salad for only $7.99 (see pics)   You can't go wrong with this and two people could easily share this meal, it's alot!  They have some pretty good sandwiches like the "Brewers Club" (see pics)  I've also had their Chicken Fried chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes.  Decent Food and relaxed environment make this place easy to enjoy. 3.5 stars

After my earlier mishap at The Coffee Buzz, I decided to give Seattle a shot.   I never even knew this place was here until I came across it on yelp earlier this week.   It's a bit dark inside, thy have a pastry case but it needs a makeover, maybe the darkness is what makes it seem uninviting?   I order the same thing here, an Iced Dirty Chai Soy Latte.   There goes another $5, but at least this time it was worth it!   Damn Delicious, I taste the spicy chai along with the perk of the espresso and it wasn't overpowering either, I appreciated that.   It was a perfect balance that had me zippin' all day ;-)   4 stars for my drink, although I think they could make the place feel more welcoming by brightening it up in there and offering some more food items.

I can only speak for this Locations quality but I LOVE it here they have never disappointed me!   They have delicious homemade soups each day something different. My favorite is the Tomato Bacon soup if you can be lucky enough to get there on a day they have it.   They always have a lunch special and a dinner special to choose from, I Love that!   Best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had,  Best Fish and chips I've ever had juicy white fish crusted with panko crumbs NOT greasy AT ALL.   Their Creme' Brulee is right up there with Fleming's or Ruth's Chris.   Again I'll say this is one of my Favorite places to eat I know it is always consistently good fresh food!   5 Stars for being Delicious Every time, I Love you Keegans Ahwatukee!

I really wanted to have a Birthday cake for Zoey's 4th Birthday and The Bone Appetit Bakery did not disappoint.   With just 24 hour notice I was able to choose a bone shaped cake from one of 2 sizes, I chose the small (see pics) A very tasty Peanut Butter and Honey cake with cream cheese frosting. All natural human grade ingredients, no sugar, salt or additives, Zoey went nuts for it!   I also purchased her a cute little party hat to wear for her birthday (see pics) they even sell invitations if you are planning a big doggy bash! ;-)   Your dog would just Love it if you brought home a Birthday cake for them, or even some of the house made baked treats they sell here.   Go Now!

Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime.   We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds.   The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible.   When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat.   Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki!   Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order.  This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night!  The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night.   My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a  damn big mac. WTF!   The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it.   Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but "have a nice day"!   *vomits*

Holy Sweet Peppers! The most amazing sandwich my little vegan belly has ever had!!   I have NEVER heard of a sandwich shop that has veggie/vegan turkey, its 100% soy and 1000% delicious! The rolls they use are baked fresh daily at a local Tempe bakery and are out of this world! A small sub is literally the size of my forearm!! I like mine with mustard, lettuce, tomato, salt and pepper, oil and vinegar, pickles and of course SWEET PEPPERS!!   I can't get enough of this place, I've been 3x in the last week!   The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is that even if I order my sandwich to go and spend less than 5 minutes inside the shop I leave smelling like the cheese steak grill.  Maybe they could do curbside service? ;-)

VEGANS, BEWARE!   When I first started going here I asked specific questions about the "veggie" meat, Was it Vegan? Did it contain any dairy or egg? etc.  I was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a 100% soy product.   I recently heard that their "veggie" meat contained egg whites.  I called up and asked them to please look at the ingredient list to verify this and sure it enough it contained Egg Whites!!   I am so upset that that the owner/manager of this shop was so ignorant  that he could profess the vegan wonders of this "veggie" meat to me knowing that it was not.   I'm appalled by the false pretense and all the times I ate here unknowingly putting things in my body which are not OK with me.  What if I had been deathly allergic to eggs?

I first found out about this place when my neighbor mentioned he was one of the cooks and so graciously surprised us one day with a couple platters of enchiladas and a giant bag of chips and salsa.   We loved it so much we decided to go to the restaurant and eat.   Just for the record,I'll have you know some of the best Mexican Food Restaurants I've eaten in have had no windows and Rositas is no exception.   Service was prompt and friendly. Chips were hot and crisp. Salsa was good too but not as good as the kind we were given by our neighbor...must have been his special recipe ;-)   I ordered the 2 item Lunch combo for $7.95 and chose a chicken taco and a tostada (see pics)  This is something I typically order everywhere I go and it's usually swimming in grease, but not here! Not even a drop!!  Everything was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!!   My husband ordered their Stacked Enchilada Platter with fried eggs on top (see pics)  Unbelievably good! Again Hot and Fresh and Truly the absolute BEST Enchilada Sauce either one of us has ever had!  This is now the go to place for Enchiladas!  I even had to ask for a side of the sauce for my dish I liked it so much.   I will definitely be back to try more from the expansive menu. They even sell items in bulk to go, great for when you aren't in the mood to make dinner, Rositas to the Rescue!   They are open at 9am for Breakfast too and serve hot cinnamon crisps instead of chips and salsa, now if that's not a reason to go I don't know what is!

Another Delicious Lunch!   This time I went all out and ordered a Carnitas Chimichanga Enchilada Style (see pics)  Wow! The Pork was so juicy, tender and flavorful it wasn't greasy at all this was such an indulgent thing to eat with all the cheese and sour cream and sauce etc. The only thing I didn't like was the guacamole because it was too spicy for me other than that it perfect to the last bite, Yes I ate it all! OINK!!   The Hubs got his usual Stacked Enchiladas with a fried egg on top.(see pics)  This time the enchiladas were served in a little crock which made the edge of the tortilla crisp but other than that he loved them once again.   Rositas will be the perfect place to pick up some food for a "potluck"  I'm going to take advantage of their catering menu since I've got a party to attend next month.  If you're ever in the area don't be scared, just go in and enjoy yourself!

My Favorite Breakfast place without a doubt!  BEST PANCAKES EVER!! Love their Skillets and Huevos Rancheros they have Delicious Benedict's as well! Only ever had an issue once where my food wasn't hot enough , but that's an easy fix.  It's worth the 35 minute drive every Saturday morning :)

Still Loving Crackers after all this time!  They are one of the few places I've been to recently that doesn't seem to be cutting corners and going down hill!   One of my favorite lunches is the "Turkey Avocado Melt" it's called the Roast Beef Avocado Melt on the menu but I always get it with Turkey and a side of fruit!(see pics)  Maybe it's the special sauce or that light and crispy grilled sourdough garlic bread but it's a Damn Good Sandwich I find ,my self craving all too often!  Try it you'll love it!

Just because I'm Vegan doesn't mean I can't enjoy a good pizza, but do you know how hard it is to find a Pizza Place that does not put cheese in the sauce??   Well I need not look any further than my own neighborhood!  Florencia Pizza Bistro Does NOT add cheese to their sauce!!   I rushed right over to cure my pizza craving.   Inside is definitely more bistro, no primary color pizza parlor here.  It was kinda dark, there was some Italian music playing, and it was still casual.   We decided to order a Large pizza half pepperoni for the husband and half no cheese add mushroom, artichoke and basil for me (see pics)  As you can see they did not skimp on my veggie half. The pizza was seriously delicious! The dough was out of this world, it was so light, I can't explain how tasty it was you'll just have to see for yourself.  The sauce was extremely fresh tasting too and I normally don't like a red sauce, but I really liked the flavor of theirs.   They have some pretty creative combinations on their pizzas I highly recommend giving them a try if you are any sort of pizza aficionado.   I give it my Vegan Stamp of approval, there is something for everyone.  Check it out it just might be your new favorite!   *Notes of interest*   *Only open for Lunch Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Monday -Thursday they don't open until 4pm   *Large patio with misters.   *Bar area with 2 Flat screens   *They also have salads, calzones, panini and sandwiches

The Real Million Dollar Baby is My ZOEY!   She had another allergic reaction, I suspect it was from the Mobile Grooming Pet Salon's Products used on her.(see previous review)  She started out with a few hive bumps and it quickly turned into swelling and bumps all over her face and body (see pics)  You can see from the pics it was pretty bad but nothing compared to what she looked like on the way to the ER.  Her eye was completely swollen shut as if she'd just went toe to toe with Rocky Balboa it was so SAD!  Of course being the worrying mother I was afraid she was going to stop breathing, so I'm yelling at my husband to drive faster, he was going 110mph!   First Regional is the nearest 24hour emergency pet clinic to my house. Super Sweet and Caring Staff!  They took her in immediately and gave her some injections of steroids and benadryl while we waited. There was 5 people ahead of me this time so the wait to see the doctor was a little longer, but at least they got the medicines working right away.  Zoey is doing better today nearly all the swelling and hives have gone away!......till next time!

You know where you are,You're in the jungle baby,You gonna die!  In the jungle ,Welcome to the jungle Watch it bring you to your shun, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, knees, knees!  Because You just might Puke after what I'm about to tell you.  I Went to Pita Jungle for my first time, I order a diet coke, I took a couple of sips and then noticed that whole inside of the cup was covered in a thick grimy film. I though that maybe it was just scratched plastic, I scraped it with my fingernail and it came off... uuuugggggghhhhhh!!!  How incredibly nasty!!!!    I'm not talking a little bit of residue here folks I'm talking Scum Build Up from Hell!!   I wish I hadn't ordered already.  I take my glass up to the counter and ask to get a new soda in a  To-Go cup.  Once I sit back down I start looking around at other peoples cups and notice the same Funk caked up inside them as well and they are greedily sipping along without even using a straw..EEEEEEWWWWW So this was not an isolated incident.  How do you not notice that, Please tell me, How do you not feel it touch your lips......(shudders)....  As I sit waiting for my food, Dear God, I can only imaging what kind of filth lies behind the counter where no-one can see if this(cup grime) is the kind of stuff they are serving up right under our noses.  I begin to look around and notice that the cups are not the only thing with the foul gunk build up......the tables too.....Oh God I'm watching a woman let her baby eat right off of the filthy thing!  My Food arrives, The glazed Chicken pizza (see pics) ......do I eat.....it looks good.....smells good....... Well It actually tasted Delicious, Unfortunately I could not eat anymore than a couple bites as I was so disgusted with the filth of this place.  I had to rush right home and shower!  1 star because of the Scuzz factor  Are all Pita Jungles this repulsive?  if not please tell me which one is CLEAN!   I will never return to this location

I need to grab some laminating supplies and Michael's was all out so I stopped here.   First of all they have rearranged the story into a confusing uncoordinated ensemble.  I asked to find the laminating supplies right when I walked in the door , one guys asks another and they send me on a wild goose chase all over the store and between the three of them passing the buck not one of them could tell me where to look.  I wandered around irritated searching every aisle until I finally find what I needed, only to have one guy come up and say "Oh yeah, that's where it was"     Glad I could help!  They need to work on their customer service skills and put the store back in a more user friendly arrangement.

I come her for breakfast once and awhile, I've never eaten any of their lunch or dinner items. Therefore my rating is only for my regularly ordered items.  My favorite breakfast is the Huevos con Tortillas (see pics) it's scrambled eggs surrounded by black beans,tomatoes, cilantro , cheese, sour cream, fresh avocado and two kinds of salsa served with warm flour or corn tortillas and juice of your choice.  They also have a pretty good broccoli cheese quiche even though the crust part isn't the best and I Love their carrot  raisin muffins too!  Don't come here during peak hours it gets quite obnoxious, I like to sit at the bar away from the crowds and get in and get out.

I happen to like Starbucks. no matter what all the haters say.   It's consistent , they make my drink perfect every time and the girls here are always friendly in the morning.   They can get busy, so I don't really like the line, but when I want a drink that I know I'm gonna enjoy I'll definitely stop here knowing it will be worth the wait.   I LOVE their Green Tea and recently found them to make a very tasty Dirty Chai.   It's definitely the spiciest chai I've had, also one of the strongest espresso's too.   I like the spice and when I'm really in need of a super boost it's good to know I can stop in for my crack in a cup! ;-)

I Love The Great Indoors!  You can find something for every room in the house, inside or out!  They have Gorgeous Model Kitchens and Bathrooms set up inside the store.  Whether your looking to do a re-model, just decorate or find a cool housewarming gift this is your one stop shop.  I've gotten everything from my Granite island installed, to my dishes, silverware and cabinet hardware here and that's not all.  Stop in and see for your self, it's just a fun place to browse even if your not going to buy anything.......but I bet you will!

UPDATE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I tried the breakfast, they have some seasonal "Spring" items on the menu.  One of them being the Blueberry Brown Sugar Pancakes, Wildflower signature pancakes, blueberries and brown sugar served with orange sour cream, hot maple syrup and sweet creamy butter. (see pics)  OMG!! Let me just say these were inexplicably Delicious, you have no idea what that Orange sour cream  did for those pancakes! A Match made in heaven!! YOU MUST TRY!  I Also ordered the  Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata: eggs, ham, brie, sauted apples, sage and leeks, served with Wildflower Home Fries and buttered toast (see pics)  This was also pretty good, the toast and potatoes were just OK but I really liked the eggs.  Adding to my list of Good Breakfasts. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  This place has pretty good sandwiches/salads/soups. I haven't tried their breakfast menu or their pasta. It's good for a quick lunch or to grab some to go.  I Love their BLT Plus, it comes with bacon, romaine, tomato, cheddar, avocado and herb mayo on toasted Sourdough, although the sourdough can be a bit tough to chew so I always ask for mine on the Focaccia...mmmmmmm......much better I can chew it and it doesn't cut up your mouth.  Down side: It's in the mall, although not in the food court, its at its own entrance by Dillard's.  It tends to be quite loud and obnoxious when busy.You stand in line to order and then they bring out your food,  if their is no tables available I wont even get in the line.

When I walked in I was impressed, it's Beautiful, it's has this inside outside kinda feel with the courtyard setting.   The menu was extensive and everything sounded delicious. I saw food that looked really good being served to other tables.  Unfortunately the food was not as good as it looked and certainly not as good as the restaurants interior would have you believe.  I got a taco and enchilada combo, the taco shell was a generic hard shell like those found at Taco Bell, the chicken inside ( I Kid you not) was the exact same chicken used at Taco Delmar  and the meaty enchilada sauce well, it must have been by  Hormel.  Everything had a different kind of peppery tasting spice that did not work well competing against each other.  It's like the Rainforest Cafe  of Mexican food.

I don't know why I always thought this place was and Italian style "Chipotle" counter service place.  I was WAY OFF and I was really pleased with what it was instead, A quaint modern space with a jazzy vibe, that was comfortable and appealing with full waiter service.  Delicious sounding menu with very reasonable prices and great lunch specials.  To start we were served some bread with a very fresh basil pesto dipping sauce that was just delicious.  I ordered the Healthy Fish from the Lunch menu which was Linguine with salmon, asparagus,tomato and basil that was low in fat and butter, included was either minestrone soup or mixed green salad for $8.95.  I chose the soup, it was so  so good and when my pasts arrived steaming hot it tasted even better than I thought it would, perfectly cooked pasta, thin and tender baby asparagus pieces and succulent chunks of salmon mixed throughout. It was the perfect amount of food and I loved every bite.(see pics)  My guest ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, lunch portion was only $5.75, it did not come with soup or salad though. It was also very tasty and fresh, another perfect portion size as well. (see pics)  For dessert we ordered the ricotta mascarpone cheesecake with amaretto biscotti crust and pine nuts with whip cream and berries (see pics)  It was good but not as good as It sounded, maybe we didn't get a fresh piece or maybe that's the way  ricotta mascarpone cheesecake is supposed to be....the the taste wasn't bad but the texture was thick and hard and a bit dry.  Overall great place     -1 star for the cheesecake

I really Love this place! I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things.   The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.  I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!  My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!

Eat Good, Feel Good! That's my motto and apparently Keg's too.  Outside: beautiful patio with misters, fireplace and plenty of giant potted foliage.  Inside: Typical, classy dark-wood and stone steakhouse/wine bar decor, very nice.  Staff:  Hostess: was cheery and kind  Waitress: was experienced and efficient, our glasses never emptied our food was served in appropriate succession and we were not rushed from our booth.  Manager: very gracious, came by our table to welcome us on our first visit and offered us a  complimentary sample of their Santa Fe Chicken dip (see pics)  It was really really good, the chips were fabulous too, I think half of them were fried flour tortilla chips, I would definitely order this in its full size.  We started with a caesar salad to share and it was split in the kitchen and served to us on ice cold plates (see pics) Fresh, crisp and just the right amount of dressing it was very refreshing and perfect to share.  I ordered the Halibut and Chips(see pics) Extremely  succulent fish in a light crisp beer batter, it was so delicious it didn't even need to be dipped in tartar sauce,the fries were well seasoned with a tender crunch, perfect.  The Mr. ordered the Keg Clubhouse sandwich (see pics) Giant sandwich,He Loved it, although even his big appetite could only accommodate half.   I was really feeling good by now, everything was just delicious, I cant believe I'd never dined here before.  To top it off I ordered the Cheesecake for dessert and asked for the cherry sauce on the side Mr. doesn't like it. (see pics) WOW! So creamy and light ,the cherry sauce was a winning touch,absolutely the perfect way to end a wonderful Lunch experience.  This is now my new favorite restaurant in the mall area, and just for the record they were well on to 5 stars even if we hadn't gotten the "first timers freebie"  I cant wait to go back and try their dinner menu!!

My 100th Review~   Dear Fleming's,  Thank you for another unforgettable evening of being wined and dined. From the moment I walked in you gave me your undivided attention.In fact I don't think you ever left my side the whole time I was there. My glasses stayed full and the food was splayed out before me in perfect succession.   My compliments to the Chef for the flawless preparation of my Sweet Chile Calamari, Corn Chowder with Lobster, Crab and Shrimp, The Mix Grill (Lemon Pepper Mahi Mahi, Poppy seed and Pepper encrusted seared Ahi and Lemon Pepper Scallops), 12oz Filet perfectly rare, the Chipotle Mac and Cheese,  your signature Fleming's potatoes and the cutest accompaniment of "F" shaped butter served with Hot bread.(see pics)  Just when I though it couldn't get any better you end my feast with a dish of the most  heavenly creme brulee and chantilly cream I've ever put my lips to,complete with a candle to celebrate my Anniversary!   You made me fall in love with you all over again.   S.W.A.K!

After my last review Fleming's manager, Miguel, gave me a phone call expressing his apologies for our less than stellar experience and invited me to come back.  I was a bit shocked by the phone call but also very grateful.  Fleming's obviously takes their customer satisfaction very seriously and it made mew feel good knowing that time was taken to care about how I was feeling.   Words cannot express how amazing our revisit was.  Linda's service was impeccable and I would highly recommend asking for her section next time you go.   I ordered the Mozzarella and Tomato salad, what a vision of loveliness it was (see pics) and it tasted just heavenly, the mozzarella melted in my mouth and the tomato's were so sweet and juicy along with that spicy basil I would have been happy just stopping there.   For my entree I decided to try the Barbecue Scottish salmon Fillet.........WOW!!  Absolutely incredible! This is bar far the best item I've ordered here and is now my new favorite. (see pics) It's sweet and slightly crisp BBQ glaze had me yearning for more.   Now I haven't ordered mashed potatoes from Flemings in years since they took their horseradish mashed potatoes off the menu, but let me tell you after trying their Parmesan peppercorn mashed potatoes I soon forgot my long lost favorite, these ones were to die for!!!  Perfectly creamy, thick , buttery and seasoned to perfection I will be ordering these from now on most definitely!   My husband's usual order of chipotle mac and cheese and a medium rare fillet was no exception to the excellence, he reveled in every bite!   What a total surprise it was when Linda brought him a Creme' Brulee with a candle to re-celebrate his Birthday!  That my dear friends is attention to detail and absolutely made us feel very special and quite frankly made our night!   Our entire evening was flawless from first bite to last.  I can't Thank Miguel and Linda enough for taking such good care of us and we will without a doubt continue dining with you.  You won back my heart and I must say you deserve 5++++++ stars!!

I took my sister and 14 month old nephew here while they were visiting.  This is such a cute place. Lot's of grass and gazebos for picnics and parties. Cute gift shop, snack bar and playground areas.  Train rides for the whole family and a carousel too!  You don't need a kid to come and enjoy this park, pets are welcome too! They'll even let you bring your dog on the train!  5 stars because I'll be back with my dog!

I wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this, yet here I was entertaining the needs of an out of town guest hanging my head in shame.   The crowds age was either 21 or 51 and nobody in between.....ugh except my friend and I.  It was very disturbing watching old people get their freak on out on the dance floor.   The DJ SUCKED!! He did not know how to cohesively mix a song, nothing matched and he would play like half a song before merging into the next song of a completely different genre. It was Awful!   Hows a girl supposed to Shake a Tail Feather without a decent flow of music?   The Drinks.....Oh The Drinks, the sticky ,sticky drinks. I felt like I was holding a lollipop that I found in the gutter.  It was really gross, not to mention the drinks were weak,  and this is coming from a self proclaimed lightweight and anyone who knows me can vouch for this.  I drank 4 martinis and still did not partake actin' a fool like so many others including my Friend!   I can't believe I'm writing this review and admitting to one of the most embarrassing nights in my life!

I came for Lunch, the place was empty.  Cute Cafe loaded bakery case and a pretty decent sized breakfast and lunch menu. Breakfast served all day.  I decided to go with the Zucchini and Mushroom Tart, served with fruit and toast (see pics)  While I was waiting two ladies came in sat down and asked me if I'd ever eaten here before. They whispered amongst themselves wondering why the place was empty and then decided they weren't gonna chance it and got up, wished me luck and left.  Well the Luck was all mine because while it may not have looked like much in the picture I'm telling you that tarts was Absolutely Delicious in Every Way!!  I would definitely come back of I was in the area again........and guess what I will be next week!

I helped my friend decide on this Hotel when she came to visit from Colorado. She was traveling with 3 kids and needed an affordable place that still had a lot to offer and Gainey did not disappoint.   They serve a FREE Breakfast buffet and FREE nightly appetizers and drinks everyday. With her 3 kids this was such a money saver!   The breakfast was actually decent, lots of fresh fruit and pastries to choose from along with cereal, oatmeal, toast even eggs, potatoes, pancakes and bacon! Selections varied each day. Juices and coffee were also included.   At night they had Free Beer on Tap and Wine along with fresh salads, veggies and dips, chips, pretzels , popcorn and hot appetizers like egg rolls.  Not to mention the basket of Paradise Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies they have at the front desk for your complimentary enjoyment!   I'm really happy that this Hotel was so much better than I expected it to be. I ended up staying a couple of nights with them and I was really pleased.   We had the 2 bedroom King/King Suite. Accented with Granite and Stone, Even the Kitchen with nice wood floors. There was a total of 3 flat screen TV's and FREE Wi-Fi as well! Also came with Bath Amenities from Bath and Body Works and a couple of cute teddy bears to take home.  Everything was really new,clean feeling and comfortable and at only $185 it was such a Steal!   The pool was nice and had lots of pretty trees and flowers around it and we basically had the pool to ourselves the whole time we were there!! LOVED THAT!   There is small fitness room on site but if you take advantage of their FREE 5mile shuttle service you can go just up the street to the Gainey Village Spa and Fitness Center and use their equipment.   Although there is no in house restaurant here you are literally walking distance to the shops and restaurant at Gainey Village.   Even though this place is obviously not a 5 star resort I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to have a clean comfortable stay, it has recently been renovated and has so many perks to help you save money!   My friend and I will be staying here again next time she visits for sure!

Even though I don't drink beer, I've been going to Rock Bottom since I lived in San Diego. And have always had a decent experience.  I stopped in for lunch. I got the Mac and cheese with NO chicken , it comes with a salad. Huge portions, Cold plate and chilled fork for the salad was a nice touch. The Mac and cheese was piping hot and really good. (see pics)  Two people could have shared the mac and cheese, I couldn't finish it, even though I wanted to.  Friendly waitress, refilled my drink and brought my check in a timely manner.

I stopped in here for Lunch today and met my girl Andrea K.  It's a cute little Christian themed cafe with an extremely friendly staff.  They offer breakfast all day, sandwiches and soups.  At first I wasn't in the mood for a "sandwich" and just settled for a turkey, I asked what came on it and was told "Anything, we customize them however you like"  SO I was a bit perturbed when I asked for cucumber and avocado and they didn't have any......I ended up with turkey, sprouts, tomato, swiss and deli mustard on wheat (see pics)   It actually was a really good sandwich but for almost $9 including a drink, I think it was a bit much.  Why 4 stars?  ~Service went along way, staff was personable and seemed to really care about the customers and I enjoyed the sandwich even though it was pricey.

If you enjoy incompetent guess work and like being a guinea pig to all sorts of unneeded medication then COME ON DOWN!  Chances are you will not be seen by a certified M.D. they will pawn you off on a Physicians Assistant, and if you happen to see the actual Doctor could really trust the opinion of someone who has a Petrified Creamed Corn Grill?   Once you get into the exam room, you wont even be examined, they walk in , walk out and grab their medical dictionary and come back in and point at the most fitting scenario/picture.  What happened to the good old days where you got into a gown and then had your eyes, ears, nose looked in and had to say aaaaaaahhh while having a Popsicle stick in your mouth? They didn't even break out the stethoscope and listen to my lungs!  I could get better medical advice from a pile of Dog Shit, Thanks for Nothing!!

This was my first play compliments of Yelp and the Arizona Theater Company. Thanks Again!!  I don't even know how to review a play but, I enjoyed it. The theater was awesome we had perfect seats, center balcony (see pics). Very cool mechanical stage and props.  Overall a great performance, although a little long I thought, 2 hours.  We had a Fabulous reception afterwards catered by Wicked Bakery and the Gelato Spot! Boy Oh Boy was that Delicious!!

What can I say that has not been said already.  This place is a Foodie's version of Crack!  I was half way home when I wanted to turn around and go get me some more!  OMG! It was just so delicious!!   Starting with the giant mason jar of the coldest Ice Tea I've ever had and it was perfectly brewed not too strong or bitter. I got the unsweetened.  I ordered a chicken breast with a waffle and a side of mac and cheese  Everything arrived steaming hot, even the syrup! I Love that! My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball, The chicken was so crispy and flavorful, not too spicy or salty but just right, it wasn't even greasy.  My Husband got the same with a side of cheesy eggs, He was lickin' his fingers and bobbin' his head.....so what does that tell ya!  All in all it was the best we've ever had, We Will be Going back!  After the withdrawals wore I off I slipped into a complete food coma and slept the whole way home!

Holy Shit! That was the best brownie I've ever eaten!  The 5 Layer Brownie is 5 layers of Luscious Sinful Heaven! Devils food brownie base with cream cheese filling topped with chocolate chips, marshmallows and fudge OH MY! (see pics)  I also got a Sugar Cookie frosted with cream cheese and a Giant  ginger snap the size of my face, both delicious! (see pics)  Cute little cafe offering soup, Boars-Head sandwiches and a few salads, but it looks like there money  maker here is the baked treats. That's what I had and the other customers were all eating the treats too.  They have about 10 different types of cookies and 7 or 8 bars, all generously sized and reasonably priced. I can't wait to try them all.  5 stars for the brownie at least , maybe I'll try the food some time.  Stop in for your 5 layers of heaven! You'll Thank Me Later~

First time, stopped in for Lunch.  Cute place, Beautiful patio, I sat inside though because it was very windy.  Awesome, hot chips and fresh salsa, very good!  I ordered the Pescado Pescado(see pics) I guess i had overlooked that the fish was fried in a corona beer batter ...........Very Overpowering flavor, I don't like beer at all, so that pretty much ruined the tacos for me. The beans and rice were delicious, though Certainly not worth $14  My Husband got the Cheese Enchiladas(see pics) They were also delicious, the sauce was just right. He said the food could have been hotter temperature wise.  Overall a nice place for ambiance especially on the patio, the food was good except for the beer batter, if you like beer though it might have worked for you, and I think their prices are a bit greedy.  2 stars  3 words Beer Batter Splatter

Well  I don't know what Kind of sex they've been having, but I've never had sex that Bad!  Honestly the worst Carrot Cake I've Ever had!  Served in a big thick square, no layers, no filling, it had the consistency of wet packed sand that was thinly covered with a flavorless white frost and sprinkled with toffee chips and topped with a soggy strawberry.UGH!  I'm so glad I didn't have lunch there, and now I never will.  It was also just a weird vibe walking in there, it's located in the same shabby courtyard as the country cottage, but had no class.  To the right as I walked in was a dimly lit area that looked like a ceremonial orgy room with a shrine to the God awful cake...WTF...  There was about 4 or 5 dark haired wannabe Italian guys running around acting like waiters.........is that supposed to be a turn on to get you ready for the non-climactic cake........I think only Pasta Brioni can pull that one off but barely.  So I took 2 bites and threw it in the trash, said thanks for nothing and called my husband to tell him he had NOTHING to worry about!!  FYI...if your sex is so bad that your are resorting to that cake.....GOD HELP YOU!

Be seen in 30 minutes or less guaranteed?? I would have never believed it but Yes its true, I was in and out within 25 minutes with a thorough evaluation backed by a doctors 100% assurance.  I'm so thankful that Lindsay L. recommended this place.  Dr. Trang was wonderful, the staff and office was much better than any urgent care facility Ive been to, it just had a totally different feel to it.  I felt better immediately just knowing that an actual certified M.D specializing in internal medicine had taken the time to treat and diagnose me properly, and  all in 30 minutes.

Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news ,but I had an awful experience here and it makes me hesitant to EVER go back despite the good reviews for dinner and dessert.  I went for lunch with my husband. I wanted to see the menu first but he wanted to just go for it.  It's very cute inside, I Loved the Mediterranean/Romantic feel with lighted orange trees and faux rock walls, wood beams and rustic chairs.  I HATE paper table cloths, as they are prone to giving paper cuts and always make me think of Macaroni Grille.  I was not feelin' the menu but decided to try one of their Focaccia Panini's with grilled chicken, tomato, avocado and spinach. My husband ordered pasta with Tuscan meat sauce.  First we were served flat diet coke and some day old bread.......sigh.....  Good rustic bread is sometimes chewy and maybe even tough, but never just crumbles the way this bread did...maybe it was more than day old?  My sandwich arrived and looked OK (notice no picture) After one bite I knew it wasn't good, but I took a few more just to make sure.   The spinach looked to be from a can or frozen, it was really mushy and the green color was looking really more of a brownish.  My husband's pasta was piping  hot and he said it was OK also but had a weird taste to the meat..??  SO I didn't eat anymore of mine and when the waitress/manager/hostess came over I told her why (spinach and just overall not good) She insisted it was Fresh..............Honey Please!   Maybe last week when they sauteed it but now it was a soggy mess.  I Love spinach and I assure you there is NO WAY that spinach was fresh at any time during the last week!  My Husband says I need to YELP on my own time!  2 stars for the decor

I didn't set any high expectations after reading through the previous reviews and the name really doesn't do the restaurant and favors either.   However I was pleasantly surprised.  The interior was dark and homey like some kind of hunting lodge with large booths and a Fireplace separating the two side of the restaurant and bar.   The menu had a lot of items to choose from. I decided on the Blackened Salmon Sandwich per the waiters recommendation and the fact that he told me that they fly in fresh seafood daily. (see pics)   My Sandwich was nothing less than Amazing! Really that was the most Delicious Salmon I think I have ever tasted, it was so fresh and juicy and perfectly grilled, WOW!  Not to mention the Sesame encrusted bun from heaven that it lay upon and the most beautifully fresh sliced tomato I have EVER seen on a sandwich ANYWHERE!  I chose pasta salad as my side instead of fries, this pasta salad was really fresh and tasty with sliced carrots, olives and peppers, dressed in a basil vinaigrette.   My daughter chose the Cheeseburger, as usual.(see pics) Even though I don't eat red meat I could see how juicy and flavorful her burger was. It was cooked to a perfect medium and came served on the same heavenly bun that I had, she was oohing and aahing over every bite.   Lucky for me I had a gift card to the VT or I may have never even bothered to try it.   I will be back for sure and if they keep up with this experience they may just get another star!

What can I say ~ I Love Ruth's Chris!  From the moment I walked in I was waited on with the utmost attention.  I made a reservation for some friends and I. I arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamari(see pics)  PJ the bartender took very good care of me, he was funny without being obnoxious, we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers, he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have! I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet) He was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive.  Thanks PJ~  Dinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.  I ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.  My guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.  After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)  I spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~

You might think its just a sandwich but try making it taste that good at home. It never works for me.  I love the Picnic Company, it was the first place I ate at while visiting Phoenix about 6 years ago and still a favorite now that I live here.  Huge menu, sandwiches, salads, soups and yogurt shakes. Fresh ingredients, generous sizes and a comfortable dining area.   My favorite is the Turkey on nine grain with the works(hot honey mustard, mayo,lettuce ,cucumber, tomato and sprouts with your choice of cheese) and a side of their Artichoke Tortellini pasta salad, LOVE that pasta its so Good!!  Nothing but Fresh Food and pleasant experiences here for me!

I've never been climbing before and was excited to try it for the first time.   The facility is huge and colorful which makes it look super fun and inviting.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly as well as very good at making a newbie like me feel safe.   There are many different walls of difficulty, giant climbing ropes like they have in old school gym class, as well as two bouldering rooms where you climb only as high as you are comfortable falling because there is no ropes involved.   I stuck to the beginner wall and scaled it 3 times, not quite to the top though.   Thanks to Lindsay F. for putting together the UYE. I'm so glad PRG was participating in "Yelp Kicks Butt" or I may have never thought of coming here.  I plan on coming back with my husband and trying to get to the top.    **They don't have lockers, just shelves, so leave your valuables at home or locked in the car.

Thank You Erica.O and Praise to Allah that I finally found some Baklava worthy of the sacred journey through my Gullet.  Now onto the rest of my review, I met a friend for lunch, I started by ordering the Hummus and a Spanakopita (see pics)   The hummus was good, although I didn't get the the thick fresh pita I saw everyone else eating? I guess you have to ask for the good stuff,  Newbie mistake #1, the pita I got wasn't too bad though.  The Spanakopita wasn't all that it, tasted too "green" not enough flavor of feta, and by microwaving  it  the flaky crust became unflaky and jut soft and chewy, not good.  I ordered the Vegetarian Combo she ordered the Shawarma plate (see pics) My plate had babaganoush, falafel (hiding under the tomato salad) Tabbouleh and 2 stuffed grape leaves served with a side of yogurt / tatziki sauce.  I thought everything was really good and tasted pretty fresh except the grape leaves, they were atrocious, the rice inside was unrecognizable, it was so overcooked it completely turned to a mushy paste, bummer, grape leaves are my favorite. ( I will make them for us Andrea, I Promise)  I wish I had more of their falafel I pretty much filled up on the tatziki, babaganoush and pita. Now I know what to get next time.  So our waiter come over and says "Since this is your first time, I'll take care of the bill, just take your ticket to the counter"  WOW~ Are you serious, how generous!!  We wait in line, give our ticket to the guy and he keeps asking us to pay???  Well Apparently  there was a confusion of some sort, I don't know what the waiter meant by that, We though our lunch was going to be free.....it wasn't....but that's OK.  That's when I ordered my baklava, one piece.........I go to the car to eat it and went back in for 2 more pieces.....YUM!!  4 stars for the Baklava at least

SO many reviews already I'll try to keep it short and Sweet!  Food~ I've only been for lunch, is Always Delicious, price, quality and quantity wise. Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics)  The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)  Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all.  Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar.  I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.  Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.  *Notes* ~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe ~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters ~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees ~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile  **parking meters have an 80min. time limit, mention this if you are having SLOW service  I  have to give 5 stars for the food

When I first moved to Phoenix I unknowingly wandered into this place.  I love a good bargain, who doesn't, but this place gives new meaning to the term "Dumpster Diver" or perhaps it's where the term originated.  I felt dirty just being in this place.   If you've ever seen the cartoon of Tom and Jerry when Tom is fishing and reels in a dirty old rotten boot............................Same concept applies to this store.  I wouldn't recommend it.

I was enchanted just upon entering this place (see pics)  It only got better once I was inside even though it was a pretty small place , approx. 10 tables.  It was dark for ambiance but brightly decorated, white linen tables, fresh flowers on each table, parrots mirrors etc.etc.  We started with the Guacamole and tostadas with a salsa trio  (see pics) Pico De Gallo, Chipotle and the most Divine Fresh Tomatillo Salsa I have ever tasted, I was literally eating it with a spoon once the chips ran out!  Everything was so fresh and tasty!  We also ordered a Watermelon Agua Fresca which was so refreshingly delicious, even though I'm not sure it was a good mix with Mexican food (we took it to go)  I ordered the Enfrijoladas: Homemade corn tortillas filled with chicken and topped with a black bean sauce (see pics) WOW! This was so Perfect I can even begin to tell you how Much I LOVED it!  My guest ordered the Farolitos Al carbon with Chicken (see pics) The taco came with rice speckled with fresh veggies like corn and chiles along with a bowl of soupy pintos. Another Amazing dish even though the tacos were pretty spicy overall it was all very fresh and flavorful.  Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert , but that's just one more reason to come back.  Did I mention the waitstaff team.......Impeccable service!  My glass never emptied, in fact It never even got half full.  I can't forget the man on guitar ,I mean  who doesn't love being serenaded during Lunch!  A Definite Must Try Folks! You Don't Know What Your Missin'!

WOW~ I just had the best sushi for Lunch that I've ever eaten in AZ.  I ordered the ASU roll, although a bit expensive it was really good, the Tempura Shrimp roll was one of the best I've had, the shrimp was still warm it was so fresh and not only that but you get two pieces of shrimp inside  instead of just one, The Tuna nigiri was also super tasty fresh, the rice was perfect ,not too sticky, (see pics)  After eating all that I asked for a special order (not on the menu) of Tuna , avocado and cucumber rolled in sesame seeds. Sushi chef whipped this up for me no problem and stuffed it generously (see pics) I don't remember the last time I saw rolls as full or as fresh as the ones I've eaten here today.  My only complaints are that the host/cashier station is in the center of the restaurant so there they are staring at your every bite(literally),  the chopsticks are a bit bigger than normal and square shaped so I found them a bit awkward to use,  and although I sat at the sushi bar I had very little interaction with the sushi chef other than him handing me my plates, the waiter took my order to him, there was no piece of paper to mark my choices and hand in like I'm used to. Another thing is most of their rolls are topped with macadamia nuts so I ordered them without, no biggie I guess.  Deliciously Fresh and very well stuffed rolls, I could have easily spent $100 on my lunch by I stopped near $40.

It's been awhile since my last review and I'm still giving 5 stars!   I like to come her for lunch and sit at the sushi bar because I'm usually solo plus It's fun to watch all the sushi being made.  I like that Richard (owner/sushi chef) remembered me even though I hadn't been here in awhile.   My favorite things to order are still the Tempura Shrimp Roll, Tuna, Avocado and Cucumber Roll with Sesame Seeds, Spicy Scallop Roll and on my last visit I ordered a California Roll with Asparagus and it was divine.   By far the freshest, tastiest and most generously sized sushi I have ever had.  I highly recommend checking it our for lunch because they also have some pretty affordable lunch combos.

This was my lunch stop today!   I usually don't sit on the patio at restaurants (especially on a windy day)but the dining room was full and I didn't want to wait.  I was pleasantly surprised, I really enjoyed sitting outside. The building completely blocked the wind from the patio, it was perfect. They also have purse racks at your table! COOL!  It was much quieter outside compared to in and they were playing some Spanish guitar over the speakers, I Love that music.  I decided to order the Grilled Swordfish Tacos,  they were delicious and fresh (see pics) made to order grilled corn tortillas are Amazing! $18  I was still hungry after though..........  I saw some scallops go by to another table and wondered if that was a special because I didn't see it on the menu.  I asked my waitress,and YES they were a special, I decide to order that as well.  OH WOW!!! Absolutely Delicious!!!!!!  3 HUGE pan seared scallops on a bed of sweet corn polenta topped with wild mushrooms and a light gravy/sauce!! (see pics) $17  So ya I spent $50 on lunch for my self! (that's including a $10 tip)  Good food is worth every penny to me, I'll definitely go back but only order one entree next time.  For the record I do think the tacos were a bit over priced but the scallops were totally worth it!  5 stars for my waitress not telling me I'm a Pig!

I went today for lunch. They have an all you can eat Lunch Special, for $9.97 you can graze their very nice salad and seafood bar plus a 4 dish hot section.   I was pleasantly surprised, everything was really fresh and all the things I tried were Delicious.   Some of the things I ate were, Tilapia with pineapple sauce, Potato Lasagna it was kind of like scalloped potatoes very thinly sliced with cheese in between, really tasty. Shrimp ceviche, roasted eggplant salad, fresh blanched broccoli salad, roasted zucchini salad, chicken salad, marinated mushrooms and some other things that are slipping my mind at the moment.   Sorry No pics this time, it would have been an awkward moment to whip out the camera in this setting being I was all by myself.  Hopefully next time I wont have to go alone ;-)  I would surely go back for lunch again and maybe even dinner. Even though I'm not really a meat eater, there was plenty of vegetarian options to fill me up.

Love their Pizzas, The Avocado pizza and the mushroom party are my fave! Love the Caesar salad , yummy California rolls, love the grocery side too.  Downside is no waiter service until after 4pm!  You also can't order pizza during the week until after 4pm!  Parking is a nightmare and they are always very busy.   My biggest complaint would be when my family and I had went there to celebrate mothers day (not on actual mothers day) one year and they did not want us to move a couple of tables together, they expected us to all sit at separate tables...WTF.....I mean they really put up a fight over this  BUT, Of course I was not having that, and moved them anyway....I've noticed since then they have welded the tables to the ground and you CANNOT move them, so if you are going with more than 4 people it really sucks!  I do Love the food so I will suffer serving myself and having to put up with the mobs on the weekend to enjoy a pizza for lunch.  I had to take away a star because it's really inconvenient to go there even if the food is divine.

Awesome and Authentic!  ~I Loved this place just upon entering, beautiful fountain and courtyard, a row of souvenir vendors.   You definitely feel like you've left Phoenix, which can be a good thing!  I didn't realize how huge this place was!   ~Once we got inside, we were greeted and seated. Service was great.  ~Fabulous chips and Yummy Salsa!   I ordered the Gringo Loco Enchiladas(see pics), which were stuffed with chicken,corn , black beans and cheddar cheese and smothered with your choice of red or green chile colorado..................I chose red.........Lucky for me I was served green by mistake, I didn't want to say anything I just figured I'd eat it, and let me tell you I'm so glad I did......That was some of the best green Chile pork I've had and it was sooooo much better than the red sauce the Mr. had on his cheese enchiladas (my preference of course he loved his too)   Everything was perfect, unfortunately I didn't have time to check out the market side but I have a feeling I'll be back very soon!

I stopped here after Lunch for some Baklava.......well........ That was by far the WORST Baklava I've ever eaten.  I was so disappointed, after reading the reviews I was expecting something that would knock my socks off.  I ordered 1 piece of walnut and 1 piece of pistachio. They looked perfect (see pics)   Boy are looks deceiving, I bit into soaking sticky wet Goosh, it was so soggy and stale at the same time, I literally spit it out along with the next bite of the pistachio piece, both not worthy of swallowing, it was that bad!  I guess I'm spoiled, nobody makes Baklava better than my Mom or my Gramps, I need to make a trip home.  1 star for their Baklava, I'll have to go back to rate the food,maybe.

WOW! What else can I say....everyone has pretty much covered it!  I stopped in for a snack the other day, got the soup of the day , the quiche and a luscious lemon cake(see pics)  They won me over with freshness and Delicious flavors. I had already made plans to come back in my head.  So I find myself here again, this time just to try some more of the desserts to go. The only picture I could have taken was of the crumbs on my shirt...sorry the goodies barely made it to the parking lot and I went back in for more!  caramel creme macaroons, cinnamon butter muffins MY GOD!! Pure HEAVEN!!  Cute Counter service cafe, with distinctive French/Mediterranean fare, serving breakfast lunch, dessert and daily specials

I finally made my way into the Wicked Bakery.  I had first tried these heavenly cakes when Slade so graciously catered them to one our UYE's at the Arizona Theater Company.   I had fallen absolutely in love with the Red Velvet.  What else could I possibly add, all these reviews have nailed it! Slade is a Wonderful host and Baker, Cupcakes and other goodies are amazing!  This time I grabbed a Red Velvet of course, a chocolate/chocolate and a caramel pecan swirl pastry(see pics). All of which were just as I expected them to be, Fresh and Fabulous!  Stop in for a treat, and if your lucky the real treat will be getting to meet and talk with Slade in person.

OK OK, so I gave it another try and you know what, I'm convinced that it is actually pretty damn good!   The key is....order your pasty well done or extra hot or whatever you want to say. I even heard another guest sitting behind me ask for theirs cooked extra hot!   So this time I ordered the Pilgrim....Turkey, Stuffing,Sweet Potatoes and grilled onions served with a side of their Bomb-Diggety Red Wine Gravy and cranberry sauce. (see pics) LOVED IT!!!!  I'm craving it!  I ended up splitting with Nathan S. and also got to try his Chicken Tikka Masala (see pics) which tasted very much like real authentic CTM.....although I did feel it was a bit spicy for my taste I liked it and the yogurt sauce helped cut the spice.   So that being said I ordered 2 Pasty's to go to bake at home and let me tell you that is the ticket! The hotter they are the better they taste!!  The Fam agreed they were a hit and once again Super Mom saves the day!   P.S.  Strangely enough there was no mention of our dessert???? NATHAN? I'll let you take care of that. I guess you didn't like it?

I'm almost ashamed to be writing this review, because I DO NOT eat Fast Food Ever!   But twice, OK it was 3 times, I have let my hungry stomach and my teenage daughter do the thinking when it comes to lunch.   I have to say though, if they did not offer the grilled cheese, there would be no way I could be talked into going here.   I actually enjoyed my grilled cheese, basically a cheeseburger with everything but the meat, and those strangely addicting fries I really couldn't stop eating.   For Fast Food it was not bad, it didn't make me feel bad for eating it either, not even the fries, maybe its because they aren't really greasy?  Anyway, as much as I hate to admit it, the next time I'm starving to the point of not thinking and need a  quick meal, I would come back for a grilled cheese and fries for sure!

I was intrigued by all this talk of the salad room. I had to check it for myself.  I thought the interior atmosphere was quite nice, a little dated but nice.  I decided I would try the Salad Room. (see pics) While I was impressed with the Salad Room itself, the contents were mostly things I wouldn't  care to eat, not even sure what some of the stuff was.  I only made one trip and ate only half of that, And the Little Debbie Pinwheel wasn't one of them.  Everything looked and tasted too institutional if you know what I mean.    Maybe you don't.....  OK how about looking around and seeing waiters coming out of the kitchen serving plates with those plastic lids over them(they really did)......I Just got taken back to the convalescent home I used to visit my great grandmother in during dinner hour.......blech......I've never seen those lids used in a restaurant?  I really just got grossed out while eating there, maybe it was the guy next to me me having the all you can eat fish and chips with his little jar and spoon of cocktail sauce that was served to someone else after he left I don't know, but I do know I wont be going back.

Never Judge a Book by its cover! Don't let the decor of a senior resort and hotel in Miami fool you.  This place is HUGE, its FRESH, it's CLEAN and above all else it's DELICIOUS!  I ordered a half and half with tuna and fruit salad, dining partner orders the half and half with tuna and the crab pasta salad (see pics)  Both are served with a crisp pickle wedge and a peppermint patty. The Tuna was Ice Cold and really tasty, the bread was very fresh and soft, the fruit was wonderful, with chunks of oranges, kiwi, strawberry, grapes and melons. I also tasted the crab pasta salad and it was very good as well.  If you don't have time to stay for lunch they have a very cool feature of calling in your order ahead and picking it up at their drive through! They have Daily specials, sandwiches, salads, soups, homemade desserts, a gluten free menu and also offer catering.  I highly recommend trying this place for a fresh lunch and enjoying the courtyard views, you will feel like your on vacation.  **Open from 10 am to 4pm Monday through Friday

Last week I was craving the Tuna Salad Sammy from Pugzies, it's cold and crisp and perfectly refreshing on a hot day especially when paired with the fruit salad!   Check out my Glorious Lunch (see pics) complete with a cream cheese brownie, which was much lighter and fluffier than a brownie, more like cake if you ask me, but still yummy!  This is by far one of the better sandwich shops, check it out!

OK, so I go in thinking I'll have a lite breakfast and a little something to drink.   Cute place.   I see the chalkboard special , it sounds good and was named after me.   I decided to order the special and an Iced Dirty Chai Soy Latte.  I am told they are out of some of the ingredients for the breakfast sandwich I wanted.........REALLY?   Than why the Hell is it still on the chalkboard???   I just stick with the drink then, I watch her make it with a few pumps of the chai syrup? a whole damn lot of vanilla soy milk and a shot of espresso.   I'm glad i passed on the food because after handling my money she proceeded to chop up tomatoes for previous customers order with unwashed bare hands, dirty fingernails and chipped polish to boot!   Quite disgustingly unsanitary if you ask me   As for my drink ..........to be perfectly honest, and you know I am..........I had a few sips and threw it away, $5 down the drain!   There was absolutely no hint of chai to be tasted, it was extremely thick with a weird taste and their crushed/shaved ice does not do iced drinks any favors, unless maybe its water.   I'm sorry, but for a place who copied the Starbucks logo into a spoof to put it down better hope they blow the doors off of them, and they DON'T!

Trying to find a Sushi place that is open for lunch on Saturday was tough but we did find Sushi Ken.   We were served complimentary miso soup and edamame.   Their sushi picture menu had a lot going on so it was hard to decide, we ended up getting an avocado roll, a vegetable roll, a crunchy roll and a tempura fried California roll.   I wasn't really paying attention to the sushi being made because I was busy eating my soup and edamame.   All our rolls looked good but sadly, not tasting all that great.  The seaweed was so chewy, the Crunchy Roll is advertised as using snow crab but it was obviously mixed with Krab as well, not to mention what tasted to me like a gallon of Miracle Whip, it was soooooo gross!!  The Avocado roll was the best one despite the chewy seaweed, the deep fried roll was just gross too, definitely made with a roll that was quite possibly rolled days ago and the vegetable roll was just OK,  it had a strange mix of veggies inside, I don't even know what they were.   Now another couple walk in and sit near us at the sushi bar and I was able to see the sushi being made since I was done eating.   Sure enough, I see the chef grab pre-made rolls from across the counter and top it with fish for a rainbow roll. GROSS!   There is no reason why these rolls could not be made fresh to order.   Now on to an even bigger surprise, you know how they usually grab a piece of seaweed and a hand full or rice and begin to work it onto the seaweed........  I saw the chef grab a piece of seaweed and take it down behind counter for literally 1/4 of a second and come back up with it covered with the pressed rice WTF!!!   Their rice and seaweed it also pre-made not wonder it was so damn chewy!   I would rather wait and wait for freshly made sushi any day than be served soggy chewy old  pre-made Crap!   Seriously I'll never go here again!!

I've had the cookies! Love them! Urban Tropic is my fave!  But my real excitement comes from the fact that they now make Cupcakes actually called Ollie Cakes which are so sweetly and cleverly named after their newborn son.   I stopped in today and got one of each,(see pics) Chocolate with Chocolate Ganache, Carrot with Cream cheese frosting, Brown Velvet , just like a red velvet but without the Dye! and the Seasonal Lemon Ollie cake.   I had to eat a Brown Velvet right there on the spot and WOW!  So Super Delicious Fresh and Fluffy Moist with Tangy Cream Cheese frosting that wasn't too sweet. It was total perfection!   We took 4 more, 1 of each to go. Thinking that wasn't too smart on a hot day we ended up eating them all in the car, you know so they wouldn't melt ;-)   My Favorites were of course the Brown Velvet and the Carrot.  The Lemon was OK, definitely one of the better lemon cakes I've had and the Chocolate Ganache was really good too.   I'm very pleased to announce that after eating 21/2 Ollie Cakes to myself I did not get sick with the sugar high or heartburn that I normally do after eating cupcakes.  Fabulous 5 stars for the Cookies and the Cakes and I just Love the name too!  I can't wait to go back and have them again!

I Love that this is an actual "Park" setting (see Dee's pics) instead of just your typical chain link enclosure.  Kind of hilly ground with lots of trees,grass and gravel. They have a watering area, bag dispensers and even pooper scoopers.  Unfortunately it seems that no-one uses the bags or scoops because there is an over abundance of Dog Shit all over this place, I mean it was bordering on disgusting , every other step I was carefully averting these squishy landmines.   Why are people so Lazy and Foul??  SO needless top say I didn't stay long and have come to the conclusion that my Dog just might not enjoy the dog park after all. Her mouth becomes a dripping slime machine whenever I take her, and she wanders around dazed avoiding the other dogs at all costs.   All this subsides as soon as we leave so maybe she is just a spoiled priss, who doesn't like dirty strange dogs and the filth they play in?  2 stars, until they get a fecal regulator on duty

one Word....EEEEWWWW!!!!  This place is like a nursing home cafeteria. The Food and the customers!  Being called a pancake house I thought that the pancakes would be good....instead I got old dry crumbly and cold cakes...... my omelet was more of a scramble and the eggs were browned and slimy... is that even possible?UGH!  I'll NEVER eat there again!!   If there was a choice for no stars they'd be getting that.  And all I can say is anyone who thinks this place is great needs to quit drinking!

I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I was really looking forward to trying it out after grabbing their menu the last time I walked by.  I Ordered the FIG and PROSCIUTTO PITA (caramelized fig and onions, prosciutto and Oaxaca cheese melted and served with orange rosemary dipping sauce. Side choice I picked was chips and hummus.  OK I didn't even take a picture because it wasn't that pretty The Hummus was green like guacamole, I dared to taste it and ....YUCK!    My pita was wrapped in that deli paper, once I removed that I noticed that the whole pita was split open on the bottom...Shame on them for serving me a broken pita!  After one bite I had to remove the Prosciutto because it was way too thick and pungent, prosciutto should always be PAPER THIN.  So I bite again and my figs and onions are a bit cold......sigh..... Although the pita was warm and soft and the cheese was melted properly.  The highlight of my dish was the Orange Rosemary dipping sauce it was delicious paired with this sandwich minus the prosciutto, had my pita not been broken and cold it would have been perfect.  I did not like the fact that when chef #1 came to see if I was doing OK she went back to report to chef #2 how I had picked off the prosciutto.....  No wonder I was the only customer in the place!  Hardly worth $11 and some change  2 stars for The Orange Rosemary sauce!!   I went to The Urban Tea Loft after and Had myself a Lunch Worth Payin' For!

I really wish they would have had solo diner friendly items on the menu so I wouldn't be forced to eat a whole salad and a whole pizza all by myself.  I've taken to wearing maternity shirts when ever I go out to eat now so that I don't get ghastly looks from other customers wondering why I'm eating so much.  I ordered the spinach salad with pancetta and goat cheese (see pics) It was alot, why couldn't they have made me a half order?? Although I had  no problem eating it, it was just delicious, I loved the pancetta vinaigrette, it was perfect. It came with a sourdough roll and butter.  I would return just to eat this salad.  I also ordered the Wild Mushroom and Truffled Arugula Pizza.  (see pics) Again alot of food, you won't find slices here or personal size pies. Needless to say I did finish it all.  It had a light, thin and crispy crust ,almost cracker like. I thought it was good but really lacking in flavor, I put salt on it...didn't help much...it was just kinda bland, I liked it but I've had Better.  Even though you order at the counter, get your drink and seat your self, There is waiter service to come and refill my drink, which was nice because I sat outside and wouldn't have liked to leave my food alone to go inside and refill my glass.  My waiter was Awesome and refilled my glass about 4 times......Afterall I was really thirsty from eating that saltine crust.  I  moved the stars up to four because the staff was so nice, my glass never emptied, I even got a to go cup full and I was kindly greeted upon arrival and departure.

I happen to have a couple boxes full of old vinyl that a roommate from years ago left in my house when they disappeared without paying rent........Why have I been toting them around all these years I have no idea. I guess I was hoping that someday they would make up for all the money I was owed by said roommate.  After Bookmans had a look and gave me a generous credit line, I still had a whole box full.  I just happen to drive past this Zia Record Exchange so I thought I'd try and get rid of some more of them.  Big store, well kept and smells strongly of Nag Champa. Lot's of inventory, mostly Cd's DVD's and Vinyl. If your looking for a deal and can handle the smell, new or used your likely to find it here.  In the end I was offered 48$ trade or 35$ cash, I took the cash this time. (bookmans cash to trade ratio is not nearly as high)  And I still have a box full of vinyl....pretty cool.  Now to find another place willing to take them off my hands!  4 stars for giving me money for something that was worthless to me! Thanks!!

I LOVE it!!   They've got a great vibe going on, a fabulous menu for a coffee shack, drive thru and a wrap around patio!   Thank You Kyle and Chad for outstanding service and D'lish Drinks and food.   I had a couple of their Berry Green Teas.....YUM... so refreshing!  A breakfast sandwich wich was egg, bacon, avocado, tomato and pesto on a bialy. Mmmm!  A Chai Latte Oh WOW that's tasty too and a sample of their Breakfast Buzz shake....let me tell you I was dreaming about it last night, unfortunately D'lish is a little out of the way to make my dream come true this morning, but, I promise to not be a stranger.

And if your not the type to want to hang around for meaningless small talk after you get it dirty, they have a drive thru for your convenience!

I have to tell you,  being that I am a Licensed Nail Technician I'm extremely picky when it come to getting my nails done. Here is just another reason why I usually do them myself.  I was meeting s friend for dinner and needed to kill some time so I stopped in for a quick french polish on my natural nails.  It doesn't sound difficult but I have yet to meet ANYONE who can paint a French on me better that I can!  So anyways the guy seems to be doing  things right I mean he actually filed, buffed, OH OOPS... then applied bond-aid, which for the record is used to help "bond" acrylic nails to the surface of your natural nail, it does NOT help polish stay on...OK so he doesn't know what he's doing....now he applies "sticky" the base coat that helps adhere polish to the nail.  They do Advertise , even on their business card that they use OPI product.........Yet I get a white paint from a generic bottle used on my nails, my french lines are somewhat straight except that they don't fully meet at the sides, I was willing to let It slide. Then the sheer pink and top coat are applied from another two generic bottles.  My nails looked halfway decent, I was charged $10, and feeling generous gave him a $5 tip.  He was quick to leave, end of shift I guess. I sit and dry and by the time I got to my car every single one of my nails was full of air bubbles!!!!!!  WHY you ask~ well this is what happens when you use OLD product  that has had too much THINNER added to it!!!  I can tell you from my experience I have yet to see one of these types of salons that actually uses the "REAL" high end product (OPI etc.)  They probably at one point had them but they just refill the bottles with CRAP! SO beware!!  They are only getting 2 stars because at least my nails look good from far away.  And for the record even Dolce couldn't compete with my French skills!

Curiosity Killed The Cat?  Your Damn right it did and it wasted my gas!!  I was curious, I'd never heard of Steve and Barry's, I figured it would be a cheap way to get out of buying school clothes for my 8Th grader. Shame on all you who hyped this place up.  It's like the Big Lots-MacFrugals-Pic-N-Save  version of Old Navy.  Not one single thing I would ever buy for myself or anyone else.....EVER!  Complete and total CRAP!!   Boo Sarah Jessica Parker and Amanda Bynes for putting your name on TOTAL  SHIT!  Well it least it wasn't a total loss we headed over to Pac Sun and loaded up on 2 bags full of the cutest new school clothes! Way Cool!

I just happen to drive by, I would have never know about it otherwise.  It's kind of in a funny spot (business/commercial area)  I had planned on getting a sandwich until I walked in and saw the special "Green Chile and Corn Quiche with zucchini and tomato" YUM!!!  I had to get it! To my surprise it was a crustless quiche so I no longer felt guilty for eating it and let me tell you it was Absolutely Delicious!! (see pics)  Even though it was technically a breakfast item The girl told me the quiche could be served all day unlike the rest of the breakfast menu which ends at 11am, and Lunch begins at 10:30.  I would definitely vote for that to go on the permanent menu.  I also ended up getting a Tuna to Go. Simple Tuna here, just mayo salt and pepper, then add toppings you like. Comes with a side, I chose the pasta salad (see pics)  It was a tad fishy but was still really good flavor wise and the soft Challah roll was a great compliment. I also like the pasta salad.  A great menu of breakfast and lunch items, seemed more freshly made than most counter establishments. I will definitely be back to this privately owned single location in the valley!  Check it out you wont be disappointed!! Oh Ya~ They have Free Wi-Fi!!

WOW!  Thank you fellow Yelpers for enlightening me on this Literary Wonderland!  I have to say I was really impressed when I walked in, not only at the vast selection but the fact that everything was so neatly organized and clean looking. (see pics)  I took my daughter and a bag of books, so that she could get some new reading material. She got $24 for her trade and was thrilled to walk out with a stack of new books to keep her busy.  I enjoyed walking around looking at all they had and being taken down memory lane as I saw alot of things I haven't seen since I was a kid.  All the staff were friendly and helpful and they get pretty busy, you wouldn't believe the boxes and boxes of books and things that had accumulated since we first got there. It took them awhile to tally up our credit amount but we didn't mind, we were too bust taking it all in.  We have a ton of books that we've read and will definitely return to trade them when we need something new to read.

Damn Good Pizza!  I Love a pizza without tomato sauce and NYPD's White Pizza does it right!  Check out these slices of Glory (see pics) One with Tomato and Ricotta and the other with Spinach and Ricotta  They had about 6 or 8 different pizzas to choose from for a slice, not to mention a full menu of signature and custom made pizza, calzone, pasta, soups, salad and appetizers.  The pizza had a  crispy crust with a fluffy interior, not too doughy but just like a perfect french bread, I Loved it!  Great spot for lunch to grab a slice or two and maybe a salad. I would love to try out some of their dinner items as well.

Kirkland's is Great!   They have a nice selection of home decor at affordable prices like framed art, mirrors, candles, lamps, picture frames, accent rugs, garden accessories and they also carry some really cool seasonal and Holiday items.   Another perk is there is always a sale going on and they give out alot of coupons too to help you save even more.  I walked away with a few nice gifts and some really cute garden statues for only $25.

I Just noticed this place for the first time about a week ago and put it on my to-do list. I'm thinking this location is fairly new.  So I order a slice and a salad.  Very Pleased, I got the Greek slice with mozzarella, feta, tomato red onion and kalamata olives with the ZBQ Salad which was mixed greens, BBQ chicken,roasted red peppers,red onions,sweet corn and fresh cilantro tossed with a chipotle ranch , Yum!!   The slice was huge and delicious with a soft sourdough tasting crust and the salad was also a generous size. The greens were fresh and the corn was crispy not canned and soggy like some places are, plus all the salad toppings and dressing were evenly distributed throughout the salad not just piled on top. I loved getting a mix of it all in every bite.  They also have some really appetizing and unique combinations for pizza's if your ordering a whole one, I'll definitely be trying one of those in the near future.  Not to mention a small selection of sandwiches and pastas too and the best part is they deliver.  I give five stars for flavor and quality and adding it to my list of must have lunches.

I took my sister who is visiting from California here. Also my first time.  This is a Beautiful place to walk around and people watch. But be warned it's the survival of the snootiest here!  I'll definitely return to try out the rest of the restaurants but the shopping not so much.  The stores were pretty boring to me, I Much more enjoyed the scenery and the atmosphere.  4 stars for the restaurants and the pretty outdoor setting, But wait what about when its 120 degrees? Probably not so fun!

WOW! I don't understand why this place was empty........it was freakin' Amazing!  After looking at their menu on-line I was definitely drooling for my Monday Lunch Date, I Didn't know they had a location in Chandler across from the  library which is where I happen to be so I decided to check it out.  Menu Is Huge! Everything Sounded so good it took awhile to make up my mind.   The one thing I had my heart set on they happen to be out of but I quickly forgot about  it when I ordered the Calypso Chips instead, which are fried green plantains served with a black bean dip (see pics)  I also ordered a side of Avocado dip to go with them.  Fresh and Hot and Oh So Crispy right outta the fryer.........they were fabulous....I've never had them before but am totally addicted now!  I decided for the main entree to get the Emparedado de Pollo (chicken sandwich) and split it with my daughter. It consisted of sliced poached chicken breast on crusty bread with avocado, tomato and cilantro mayo, It came with french fries and Cuban Cabbage salad (see pics)  They split the portions and you can see in my pic how much 1/2 was....HUGE!!  First of all the bread was straight outta heaven, crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside, (they also serve this hot bread as a loaf with  butter to start with) a juicy chilled chicken breast, that's right it was cold and I LOVED IT!!!   That cabbage salad was so crunchy and refreshing, laced with lime and cilantro...I'm already craving it again!  I'm not big on fries but they were also hot crisp and delicious!  I ordered a cup of the Caldo Gallego too, which is a hearty white bean and smoked ham soup with potatoes, turnips and green kale(see pics)...........Absolutely Wonderful....there is nothing like real homemade soup!  They also have a Take Home menu of Family Dinners....what a great idea!! And they cater and have live music on Friday and Saturday nights!  I highly recommend this place there is something for everyone, even Vegetarians.  I didn't have room for dessert but there at least a dozen delectables on the menu that I fully intend on going back to try!

Went back here a couple weeks ago.  Ordered the Yuca Frita (fried cassava root) kind of like a french fry but way better and the Fried Sweet Potato chips both served with Banana Guava Ketchup (see pics)  WOW! That sauce is incredibly tasty and the sweet potatoes were sliced so thin they were the best I've had!  Also decided to share the San Juan Combination Platter to Sample the special flavors of Puerto Rico which was :  Pastele (Puerto Rican tamale), Mofongo (Crushed plantains and pork cracklings),  Alcapurrias (Picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa),  Tostones (Twice fried green plantains),  Arroz con Gandules (Pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers),  Masasde Puerco Fritas (Marinated fresh pork pieces fried to a golden brown). Served with mojo.   I was not crazy about this platter..mostly greasy, and too much meat stuff, go figure the vegetarian would pick this!  The best part was the fried pork pieces which surprisingly were not greasy at all.  Next time Im getting a salad!  You really need to go here with a large group ..hint..hint..YELP EVENT!!  The menu s so big and they give you so much, to really enjoy it all you need plenty of people to share with.

WOW! Gorgeous Store!   I went in today and was just mesmerized by all the beautiful gifts, flower arrangement and designer decor. I was greeted by all the staff inside which was really nice.  Their Dried Floral arrangements are Amazing! It's great place to find a unique gift.  Stop in and see for yourself, it's a real treat!!

So I decided I can't keep taking my daughter (12) to Dolce for 55$ haircuts......That is reserved for me Only!  I thought I'd give Master Cuts in the Chandler Mall a try since we were there. You can't beat a wash and cut for $14.95.  Howie the stylist was GREAT in helping her decide on her new cut, she wanted to go really short, He gave us alot of advice on what would look good on her, which I appreciated because I was afraid she wouldn't like her hair short once it was done.  It came out FABULOUS! She Loves it , I Love it too.  Howie said we could come back at any time if she needed a little touch up or if there was anything she decided she didn't like and he would fix her right up!  I will keep taking her there for her haircuts from now on.  And I almost forgot, she got an Amazing eyebrow wax for only $9.95!!  If you stop in Ask for Howie!!

You can't beat the lunch specials here.  For just about $7 you will get your entree, rice, spring roll, wonton crisps and soup!   I of course got the red curry with tofu. The curry was wonderfully thick and creamy, almost velvety, and even though it only had green beans and bamboo shoots I loved it! I've never experienced that consistency before.   So far marking very high on my list of favorites!  I'll be back!

Awesome Service!  All of their products are human and pet safe!  Friendly technicians that are very knowledgeable and willing to explain every detail.  I can pay as I go, no automatic withdrawals , I just write them a check when they come out every other month. They'll even come out in between sprays for a touch up if you need it at no extra charge.  Bug Free is the Way to Be!

I have always loved Zpizza. I haven't had it in awhile since the location near me closed and then I became a Vegan and pretty much swore off Pizza.   I heard that they now have a VEGAN pizza and are serving it by the slice this weekend! (5/14-5/16) I went in for a slice and left with 4! It was pretty damn Delicious!  I cant wait to go back and order up my own Vegan creation, Like the ZBQ No chicken, sub vegan cheese, I might just die!   All hail Zpizza for making pizza possible for Vegans!

Had my first lunch here yesterday. It was Delicious!   I had the Del Real Sandwich, which was spaghetti squash on 9-grain, cucumber, arugula, sun dried tomatoes and homemade herb ricotta. (see pics) It came with choice of fries or red quinoa, since I eat a lot of quinoa I decided to treat my self to the fries and Oh Boy were they a treat!  Hands down the most Amazing french fries I have had anywhere, served with a seasoned smoky ketchup.  I'm giving only 4 stars since there is very Small choices for veggies/vegans ( at least on the lunch menu, not sure what they have for dinner), but I'd go just for fries and a salad and those fries are definitely 5 stars!

I don't get all the fuss over this store.   To me it's looks and feels like an over priced IKEA!  It's just boring and way too contemporary for my taste. I think I could live forever without ever needing to go back in there.

Despite this restaurants shabby location and exterior it was actually darn good.  It's grouped together in courtyard setting with a few other shops.  I ordered a half sandwich (ham, Havarti, cucumber, mixed greens and honey mustard on whole grain) and the soup of the day (corn chowder) served with a cookie of my choice for dessert $6.95 not bad!  Now this is a small place, cute and cottagy ,hence the name, one waitress and one cook.   I had a view of the kitchen and watched this lady that was not unlike my own mother  prepare each order with loving care. Everything tastes better when Mom makes it right?  My food arrived after a short wait, the sandwich was generously filled and the bread tasted possibly homemade it was thick and tender, the soup was piping hot but just right to eat and was also delicious, just needed some salt and pepper. I thought it a nice touch that my plate was garnished with some pickles, a black olive, a few carrot sticks and a deviled egg. And lastly came the cookie, I chose chocolate chip and walnut, warmed and as big as the saucer it was served on. Yum!  Don't go here if you are in a hurry, Momma doesn't like to be rushed in the kitchen.  Take the time to enjoy this quaint little atmosphere with food like your Mom would make.  I would go again, I saw some salads that looked delish!

This is my first experience with Thai food, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I ordered the Silver Noodle Stir Fry(bean thread noodles,celery, bean sprouts,mushrooms,egg and tofu in a black bean sauce) see pics.  It was actually pretty good, eating these clear jelly like noodles was strange but I enjoyed my meal, everything was fresh looking and tasting, my fellow diners meals also looked to be fresh as well.  Very affordable prices , generous portions and option of meat or tofu in each dish ,so vegetarian friendly.  I just might have to go back and try something else :)

**DISCLAIMER** I rate only on the quality and consistency of the Coconut Shrimp  Chain Schmain! If you know what to order you'll be fine.  They have a pretty extensive Polynesian inspired menu. Stay away from all that and go for the good stuff~   COCONUT SHRIMP ~Quite Possibly the best (see pics)  Their Tempura Salmon roll is pretty good too but can vary, this time it was a little over riced and the rice was on the sticky side, but it was still tasty.  I Only go here to eat those two items and occasionally their mini sundae which is super fab!   A scoop of vanilla ice cream set inside a crispy cinnamon sugar wonton bowl with chocolate sauce and whip cream! Perfection!

I try and do a little stay-cation at least once or twice a month during the summer. So when FireSky had a special "Yelp" rate I decided to take advantage of their offer.   The grounds are Beautiful and the staff is super friendly.  I LOVED that they were able to accommodate my early check in at 11am so I could get into my room and then proceed to enjoy my day by the pool.   The rooms are super cute and modern (see pics) Everything was clean and new feeling, I was even comfortable with the bed (nice and firm) and pillows too, although I wish they would have been triple sheeted.   There is two pools, the main pool is very nice with large water features which helps mask the noise, if any, made by other guests.  The second pool is set up like a beach front complete with sand and graduating sand entrance to the pool.  They should really consider upgrading their lounge chairs though because they are so uncomfortable, nothing some cushions couldn't fix ;-) Only the 3 cabanas and some lounge chairs by the beachy pool have cushions?  PLEASE CUSHION ALL THE LOUNGE CHAIRS!   Other than that I don't really have any complaints, except the fact that their "business" center charges you to use the Internet.  I don't travel with a laptop and being able to pop on the computer for something is really important and most hotels I've stayed at you are able to do this, So I was surprised to see you can't even log on until you pay with a credit card.   All in all I had a great stay and I think it's Awesome that pets are allowed with no fees or restrictions even though I didn't bring mine this time. Next time they have a great deal I will come back and maybe even bring my pup!

This was my first time for Boba! YAY BOBA!!  It was surprisingly good!  I ordered a green tea with milk and sugar syrup with regular boba....I Loved the flavor of the tea and the boba was cool, chewy like a gummy bear but doesn't stick to your teeth.  Cute and comfy atmosphere with a ton of different ways to order your boba. They also have  a small food menu which I didn't look at but saw what people were eating and it looked pretty good.  And if you've gotten a little tipsy after all your Boba drinking they even have a karaoke machine!  I can't wait to go back!

Holy Mary Mother Of God!!!!   I brought home a 6 pack and waited anxiously all day to enjoy the goods with my hubby.  I got a Carrot, Red Velvet, Vanilla Milk Chocolate, Coconut, Cinnamon Sugar and a Lemon.(see pics)  ~True Story............We started slowly ,seducing the cupcakes out of their wrappers one by one, Bite after bite made us squeal with delight, each one more orgasmic than the last, until a big crumb of frosting and cake fell between my breasts, my husband had no choice but to dive into my cleavage to retrieve the luscious morsel. It was all I could do to keep my clothes on, I wanted to roll around in the crumbs and continue with the cupcake orgy........  SERIOUSLY~ They were that Fuckin' Good!

All You HATERS sit the "F" down! I don't see you complaining about your $5^ lattes!!   I went again and I bought six: 2 Red V, 2 Black & White, 1 Vanilla Milk Chocolate and 1 Eggnog Spice. I also bought one of their yogurt covered doggie cupcakes too.!   I have to tell you,they have by far the BEST RED VELVET cupcake in town!!! . Frosting is perfect! Every time this cake has been extremely moist and the freshest of the bunch And it doesn't turn your mouth red either!!!   This was my first time trying the Black and white and I really liked it too, the cake was rich and moist as well.   The Vanilla Milk Chocolate is one of my faves, this cake is pretty dense compared to the others but definitely not dry, and GOD I Love that chocolate cream cheese frosting on top!   Haven't eaten the Eggnog one yet but I did taste the frosting (eggnog cream cheese) Hell yeah it's good!   The PupCake smelled good enough for me to eat but I gave it to the pooch and she thought it was amazing!

After reading a few reviews, I'm beginning to wonder if I even dined in the same  place as some of you?  Upon entering I got a strangely reminiscent feeling that I'd been here before........Aaahhh Yes I've got it .........Palatte is the reincarnation of the Hippie Commune called the "Brotherhood" that I was born in/at. Seriously! My Dad delivered me in a room full of Hippies.  I can't believe no one has mentioned this kind of correlation.  I'm really surprised that everyone wasn't barefoot. The staff scuttled around like drones, I saw flowers, feathers and grizzly beards. This is definitely not what I expected.  You order at the counter, take a number, sit on chairs that might fall apart, at tables older than your great grandma. Food is dropped off, that's it. There is no "SERVICE" here. You get?   If your into the whole hippie dippie, artsy fartsy, grandmas yard sale garden type of feel then you will most likely enjoy it here, not to say that I didn't enjoy it , I was just picturing something completely different and felt mildly out of place, so there for I was disappointed in that aspect.   The Food, it was good not spectacular, no oooing and aaaahing over every bite.   I got the Potato Mish Mash (scrambled eggs with potato, bacon,spinach,caramelized sweet onion, Gouda and Monterrey Jack) with the raisin,cranberry walnut toast and fresh fruit. (see pics) The eggs were a little wet, but over all had a good flavor, toast was good, fruit was soggy browned apple slices, not so good!  My Ice tea was cinnamon apple flavor?..........I wish I would have known........not very good for ice tea.  My husband got The Dolores(with no salsa) two fried eggs, corn tortillas,black beans, queso fresco and avocado. It was also just OK,  The eggs were cooked over hard , the beans were dry and the cheese was in unmelted chunks. His OJ was fresh squeezed and sweet that was nice, too bad it was served in a very small child's glass.  OK food, needs to work on a better system, should have waiter service, if you eat outside most tables are coffee table height so you will be hunching over, other than that I guess it's all about the Charm.  Peace and Love!

**PLEASE NOTE**  I have received a formal apology from Juan Jaime Himself in regards to my bad experience. I think that was the right thing to do, he is looking out for his business and cares what his customers think. I also appreciate his offer to come back and try again at his expense. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although I cant change my first experience Juan has gone above and beyond to make me a happy customer, that's gotta count for something. +1 star ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, where should I start!  *Note to self, if  a place is empty at lunch time does it mean only drunks eat here at night?  That would be a pretty good guess!  My daughter and I were running errands all day and saw this place on our way home and decided to stop.  We ordered a couple sodas, some chips and salsa, which by the way they charge you for, even though they serve chips with your entree and have an open salsa bar??? Salsa was OK but the chips were stale and had been sitting in their own grease too long.  I got the 2 tacos, one carnitas and one mahi mahi.(see pics) Greasy and Bland with Mushy Meat and just plain not good! Although I could see where someone full of tequila might think these were the best things they ever tasted, if that even counts, I Think not!  My daughter ordered the small burrito, which we thought was just a smaller version of the regular burrito. She asked for just beans and steak inside.  Well no need to waste a flash on that one, it arrived just as plain and boring as the tacos and if there was ANY steak in that burrito it must have been pre-chewed.....cause I've never seen any steak like that before and been charged and extra $2.50 for it,  where's the Beef Juan?  What a Total waste of money!  I agree with Eugene.T  I No Likey!!!

This place seemed like it would be in an airport except that the food was actually good here.  Counter service, great selection of salads, sandwiches,soup and breakfast items along with daily specials.  The staff was very friendly and helpful explaining every item I asked about and even gave us samples to taste.  You can see salads and other stuff on display in the cold case, but they actually make your salad to order.  I got the Cobb (see pics) with Dijon Vinaigrette. It was really really good! I LOVED that dressing and everything was crisp cold and fresh.  I also ordered a small size of the White bean soup (see pics) As you can see it was HUGE, I ended up taking it home and had it for dinner.  There is a draw back to this place though.......seating sucks! Only a few small tables and some counter seating. I would suggest coming here solo or only with 1 person, Unless you sit outside, they do have a large patio with alot of tables!! WTH....This is AZ the main dining area should be inside!  Aside from that I thought the food was great and I would definitely eat here again.

Another Great Find! Very Friendly and helpful staff, Fabulous Recommendations.  This shop has it all, walk in humidor, checkers, chess, dominoes and billiards, the entire shop is a dedicated smoking lounge with pub tables and chairs , leather couches and arm chairs and of course a game playing on the wide-screen.  (see pics)  They also host Special Cigar events, check the website for more details. While your there check out their thief section of the website where they have posted pictures and a full story of a Thief caught shoplifting in their store.  *Notes: They are closed on Mondays There is NO Non-Smoking section No One Under 18 allowed to enter

Another Thai Tryst! Thanks To Gabi and Stevey I decided to try this place since you both gave a great review.  I've got the Fever..........I'm craving Red Curry Like a Maniac.......  That's what I ordered, it's actually called Kang Ped Veggie on their menu, I added Tofu. (see pics)  It came with a small salad served with a spicy sweet peanut dressing that was actually quite good.  The Kang Ped arrives steaming hot! Loaded with fresh Veggies like Japanese eggplant, mushroom, zucchini, carrots, peas and bamboo shoots. The Tofu was perfect too!  While very delicious the sweet flavor of the coconut was missing, I tasted alot of butter form the veggies being sauteed perhaps and plenty of spice, I just missed the sweetness I'm familiar with.  Again Generous portions and easy prices with a Tiki Lounge Ambiance and Friendly staff.  I would come back here again, they have a pretty large menu and it's very descriptive to help out Thai Newbies like myself.  Judging from the sounds coming from the surrounding tables I'd guess they were enjoying there meals as well.

I decided to give Golden Spoon another shot.   And you know what...It was pretty damn good!!  I love that they have the "mini" size, it's perfect.  I ordered a mini cafe latte with almond roca (see pics) YUMMY!!  They also put the toppings in the bottom of the cup along with on top of the yogurt!  They have actually jumped on the Tart Train Woo Woo! Mango Tart anyone???  Different than most tarts your used to but really good nonetheless, it's taste reminded me of something I just can put my finger on??  I still can't give 5 stars until they start using fresh fruit instead of that fruit glop though.

So Back down to 1 star....THIS LOCATION anyway!  I've been here about 6 or seven times since my last update. I just couldn't get enough of the chocolate malt with almond roca!!  The problem is they are obviously in denial about the broken yogurt machine............ITS NOT FREEZING THE YOGURT!!!!!  I've questioned this many times as my yogurt is a dripping puddle by the time they fill the cup and bring it to the counter. (see pics)  I've also sampled other flavors and none of them seem to be freezing properly!  "Oh the machine is fine, it's just this flavor" "Yes it's at proper temperature we check it all the time"  That's funny I thought proper temperature would require frozen Yogurt to be Frozen???  I found another location and got the same flavor I always get and it was perfectly peaked and frozen the whole time I was eating it!   Soooooo COURTNEY.......BUY A NEW YOGURT MACHINE OR HAVE THAT ONE PROPERLY REPAIRED!!!  It's Supposed To BE FROZEN REMEMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When I first started buying BB I thought it was the greatest thing EVER!!  I got tons of beautiful produce and I loved going early to help distribute the Baskets.   Little by little my basket became more and more unusable. The quality went down hill.  I would be getting the same things week after week, things that were next to rotten upon receiving, everything was sooo dirty and some things that I would just never use, like 6 onions and 6 bell peppers.   I recently switched to all organic and I thought I would order one of the organic baskets this week for a change.   I've got to tell you I feel robbed. Honestly this basket sucks! Most of the items weren't even labeled as organic and I wasn't able to volunteer this morning so I don't know for sure if they even are.   I don't know about you but I don't need 3 bundles of celery. Again the filth that these veggies are covered in is inexcusable.   I spent $18 last week at the OTFM and got so much more CLEAN organic produce. BB charges $25 for their organic basket of junk.   I will not be ordering these again. You really could do better at the grocery store or farmers market if you want produce and then you can choose to buy locally or U.S. grown veggies.

I was lucky enough to be able to attend the Yelp Event here.   I Loved the classy but comfortable feel of the restaurant, definitely the kind of place I like to hang out, not to say that I don't like to hang out at place unlike this, but I really enjoyed the vibe going on here. Maybe it was just the Yelpers, maybe not, I'll have to go back on my own to know for sure.  We had Ace Service from the Bar Chief Carson. He makes a mean batch of Shochu! Try it you'll Love it!  The Food we ate was Delicious,The items we tried were not necessarily something I would have ordered on my own but with our pre-fixe Yelp menu we were served a generous assortment of appetizers,my favorite was the butter-fish tataki and calamari.  (see pics)  I didn't get a chance to look at a full menu to see what else they offer, but I thoroughly enjoyed the selections we were gifted.  I would likely return to sit at the bar or lounge and enjoy those appetizers again.  Where did that star go?  I'll tell ya, The bathrooms(I'm talking stalls here), although very clean and modern, were a little frightening.   Picture if you will a prisonesque airplane bathroom enclosing you in stainless steel , with no escape and no one will hear you scream.  OK so just make sure you don't go by yourself and you'll be fine!

Whole Foods, How do I Love thee? Let me count the ways:   -Vegan Cheese Cake by Earth Cafe (To Die For!!)  -Vegan Deli items like:  -Vegan Sheperds Pie (Amazing)  -Vegan Margherita Tofu Lasagna (Ridiculously Good)  -Endless Salad Bar Creations (Love the stuffed Grape leaves)  -Vegan Soups,  -Vegan Pizzas,  -Vegan Made to order Sandwiches (Love that Olive Spread)  -Vegan Sushi (Avocado Cucumber Rolls, better than most restaurants)   -Beautiful Organic Produce (Local Choices too)  -Organic Almond Milk  -Hemp Seeds in Bulk  -Mrs. Gooch's Pasta Sauce (My Favorite, try it!)   -Much more Spacious than other Whole Foods I've been to.   Listen, I could go on all day, I think you get the idea. It's my Vegan Paradise and, even though it's a little pricey, it's worth it!   I do miss the mini shopping carts though, what ever happened to those?

I've been twice. First time I had very SLOW service, but the chips and salsa were so delicious I didn't  care.  They serve two kinds of salsa with their chips both are fresh and fire roasted, one is your basic (red) salsa but Oh So Good, the other is a really unique ,tomatillo blend I think, and it is served warm...WOW. Both are spicy enough without being too hot.   I'd go there just to eat the chips and salsa!!  I also tried their table side Guacamole which I confess , I ate the whole bowl myself, it is SO GOOD!!!  I haven't ventured the menu too much because I was full from chips and guac, but I Loved the chicken enchilada, generously stuffed with juicy white chicken and covered in a scrumptious sour cream sauce. Tasty beans and rice too.  I'm only giving 4 stars because I thought their tortilla soup was gross. I'm a huge soup fan, I Love it and eat it all year round, but theirs just wasn't  good.  I need to make a visit soon, I must have their chips and salsa!!

So I have been lured back several times......  It's such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa, trust me after eating those you'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good, but NO ,to Quote Jenn H.  it is  "Blech. Die."  If and when I come back I'll stick to the chips and salsa, I also would usually order the table side gauc , but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from it.......take your time chef and finely chop that shit!!  I'll give 5 stars for the chips and salsa and 1.5 for the food, but you can't have both!

I drove 50 miles to check this place out and had a hard time finding it!  It's definitely not your typical frozen yogurt bar.  I tried a few of the flavors as well as the vanilla custard.  The best (and only reason I would come here) is the Twangy Tart! It's sour just like plain yogurt but with a hint of sweetness to cut the bite and a refreshing icy texture. It's insanely Delicious on it's own or paired with some fresh fruit.  They have a beautiful assortment of Fresh Fruit toppings but I felt their other toppings were lacking.  I decided on the Twangy Tart with strawberries (see picture)  I'm giving 5 stars  based on the unique plain yogurt flavor "Twangy Tart" and their Beautiful "Fresh Fruit" selection, I wish they were closer to me.  ETA: My Slogan  Once you try the Twang you'll be like Daaaaaang!  And Nothing else will ever be the same!

I  have tell you I am just Enchanted every time I go back!  Thank You Glynis you are such a Gracious Host!  **UPDATED**  I went back for lunch today and all I can say is WOW and WOW!!! So Wonderfully Delicious!! I'm home now and want to go back and eat again!  This is now my New Favorite place, I want to try everything they have! Have a look at my pics from lunch :)  I Got the special=Turkey chowder in a bread bowl, mixed salad and dessert for $10. And Trust that it tasted even better than it looks, I wish it would have never ended! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  As I was strolling along in downtown chandler enjoying the weather I had stopped at each restaurant to look at the menus they had posted outside hoping to scope out my next lunch spot.  I stopped to read the menu here and a friendly girl approached and asked if I would like to be seated, unfortunately I had already ate but went instead to grab and iced tea anyway.  I was greeted with a friendly face from behind the bar who offered to whip me up some suga! Sounds good to me.  As she whipped, I browsed the wall of tea ,two of the most helpful girls were telling me all I need to know about loose leaf tea and so on.  Suga's ready, Jasmine citrus tea with pureed strawberries shaken up with club soda on the rocks and on the house!....I'm in Tea Heaven!   Then I'm offered a sample of tea leaves in bag to take home and make myself.  I'm gonna have lunch there tomorrow!  5 Stars for Amazing customer service and Hospitality and the Most Delicious Food Ever! And I do Believe the Sweetest Owner/Manager I've ever met!

I went here for the first time after reading the other reviews and I was pleasantly surprised that they were all telling the truth!   If you know me you know how picky I am about getting my nails done and I would absolutely return here.   I had made an appointment the night before thankfully because this place filled right up when they opened at 10 am.   My daughter and I both got an express pedicure (standard pedicure with no massage) only $18. Great Deal!  All their instruments are autoclaved for sterility and then individually sealed, I liked that.   We were offered bottled water. That was greatly appreciated!  The girls that worked there were all so friendly.  The decor and atmosphere were super cute ,definitely more of an upscale feel.   The only thing I didn't like was the foot paddle that they scrubbed my feet with, it was a flat metal one with a rough sandpaper texture.  I don't have any callouses at all and my feet are pretty soft but after getting a scrub with that metal paddle they are kinda roughened up.  Next time I will bring in my own foot paddle or just skip that part.   Give this place a try and don't forget to make and appointment!

Well I have to reduce the stars, it could maybe be 2 1/2.   I went in the other day for a manicure. I had made an appointment the night before to come in at 10am.  People including myself and some employees are standing outside waiting for the shop to open because apparently the "owners" don't like to show up till a quarter past ten! (this happened the first time I came her as well)   I'm sorry but "owners" should be inside and ready to open the doors well before 10am rolls around!  I really couldn't decide on a color, their nail polish wall is really uninspiring. I thought what the heck I'll give "french Polish" a try this time.   The manicure station is very awkward and uncomfortable to sit at for one, as far as the actual manicure went it wasn't too bad until it was time for the massage which was completely sloppy and half assed.   Polish, I should have known better than to go with a french, I just wasn't happy with it, it looked a little yellowish with way to thick of white and a few bubbles. To top it all off it didn't even last for one day, it was already chipping off that night!!   I think that really sucks considering they charge $5 more for "French" and it did not even last!!   I may come in again for a pedicure sometime but it will take me awhile to get over that manicure robbery!

Once upon a time I used to think Ruby Tuesdays was kinda OK for a quick lunch, the one at PV mall that is.  This Location in Gilbert is another story.   When you walk inside it's so generic, almost McDonald-ish,  you'd really expect to see a play area in the middle of the restaurant. I don't even think the booths were secured to the ground.  I could never enjoy eating in there when I compare it's decor to the original Ruby Tuesdays decor; dark wood ,stained glass etc.  The food went downhill along with the decor. They don't even have the Strawberry Tallcake anymore...WTF...?!

Hidden Gem? For Sure!   Maybe it's not that hidden to people who live around here....   It's been open for a year and a half.   They are a full service salon and spa offering hair, nail and skin care including makeup , brow and lash tinting, permanent cosmetics, waxing, and massage with customized spa packages available.   My long time stylist made a move to this salon so of course I followed her.   Sleek and simple decor. Reasonable Pricing.   Clean and spacious, carries all your favorite Bumble and Bumble products.   The Staff is Super Sweet and Friendly, not fake or snooty AT ALL!  You have to love that , I know I do!   Ask for BETH, she's been beautifying my hair for nearly 3 years now and I've never had a complaint!   Thanks Beth! ;-) XO

OK ,if you have never had a Custom Airbrushed Tan......  What are you waiting for!??   In about 20 minutes start to finish, including dry time, I look like I just got back from weeks on a Tropical Island with none of the Sun Damage!   I'm totally Hooked, this new faux tan looks better than anything I've gotten from the sun or a bed.   My piece of advice to you,which is completely avoidable and only learned through experience, so I will definitely be doing it next time,  is make sure to bend over and spread'em, that way your ass crack can be nice and golden too ;-)   How's that for a visual?

I just happened to drive by here today when I was in need of some sustenance.  I was figuring I would walk in to a heavenly  bakery full of pastries galore.  Not really.  I saw a half naked bakery case scattered with random desserts, no pastry, and honestly none of them looked appealing to me.  But that's OK, I was happy to see that they had some regular food items like sandwiches and quiche on the menu.  I'm a Quiche Lover~ I did not Love their quiche.(see pics) It looks quite pretty but unfortunately it was lacking any and all flavor and the crust was really hard and tasted like cardboard. Boo.  I did not care for their version of a  vinaigrette either it was very thick and sticky. I also ordered an ice tea, and got a choice of fruity or minty,  I chose fruity. Strangely enough it tasted like a mix of the two and I didn't care for it much.  Sadly I have to give only 2 stars based on the quiche maybe their desserts are better?

In my endless pursuit for the sought after "TART" yogurt I have found another winner!  This place serves mostly gelato I think but has 2 flavors of Yogurt Original (the tart yogurt) and Original soy, which I did not taste but might be tart as well.  This Yogurt was much creamier in texture than the icier textured "Ice Tango" but still had the familiar sweet tangy flavor that I LOVE so very much.  Small selection of toppings, beautiful fresh fruit well chilled and covered.(see pics)  At only $2.25 for the small it's a great deal, plus you get a punch card, it wont take long to fill up that baby!  Only problem~ the parking lot is small so I had to circle around for a few minutes and luckily someone left, so I could park.

Great Place for a Vegan treat!   Vanilla soy frozen yogurt, soy based gelatos and vegan crepes!   Everything is made on site and they don't use Corn Syrup in any of their products!! That alone is a reason for 5 stars!   My only complaint is that they don't have much for toppings and are really scarce on the fresh fruit.  From now on this is my go to place for a frozen treat!

Stopped in here yesterday to grab my Husband a cigar.  The guy inside was very helpful and knew what he was talking about.  After his suggestion I decided on a $20 triple infused Cognac cigar, and another little Java flavored one.  My Husband Loved it!  I Even took and few puffs, and it was sweet and smooth just like my Hunny!!

The waiter was placing a "They Love us On Yelp" sticker on the door when we walked up....COOL!  I've never been a fan of that typical chopped tomato bruschetta.  The Bruschetta here Was AAAMMMAAAAAZZIIIING!!! (see pics) They have 6 toppings and you get to choose 4.  I chose the Roasted Artichoke, Caprese, Salami  Pesto and the Prosciutto, Fig & Truffled Marscapone...........Let me tell you the salami one I didn't care for the other were very good But Next Time I will Order ALL Prosciutto...UNBELIEVABLE right down to the Chewy toasted bread.  I will be dreaming about it from now on I guarantee it!  I also couldn't not resist anything with Mushroom and ordered the Truffled Harvest Mushroom Pizza (see pics) It had harvest mushrooms, melted tomatoes, goat cheese, baby spinach, white truffle oil.......WHOA! Scrumdiddlyumptious!  I could have easily eaten the whole damn thing, but was nice enough to share a couple slices with my friend who only ordered ...."a salad"  One more thing that sounded really good was the Turkey & Brie sandwich (see pics) it had oven roasted organic turkey, brie, fig, apple, lettuce, tomato, ciabatta. Accompanied by your choice of seasonal couscous, house-made coleslaw or seasoned potato chips. I chose the cous cous.  Compared to the other mouthwatering delights this sandwich really fell short ,neither my daughter or I really cared for it ......the bread was not even up to par with the other breads we tasted and the turkey was a bit dry.  However the Cous Cous Was Fantastic!!! I would love to have ordered just some of that.  I will go back for sure.  I've never been to Postino so I cant make the comparison like some of the others and I thoroughly enjoyed it so who cares anyway!

Eat lunch and chill out, perfect!   I'd never heard of Rumbi until I got some coupons in the mail (yeah, I said coupons, I'm not ashamed to use them) So I figured we would give it a shot since we were burnt out on all the other local convenient eateries.   It was cool and calm (as in not bustling with people making your lunch suck) inside, I liked the island decor for a change, it was hip, but the best part was the reggae beats pumping through the speakers, LOVED it!   They have several bowls, salads, wraps, sandwiches and burgers to choose from.  But what do they have for vegans you ask?   Well this Vegan got the Organic Tofu bowl (see pics), with teriyaki sauce and the Rumbi rice which is rice and red beans simmered in coconut milk, so delicious! I got the half size and it was still two portions for me.  A lot of food lightly dressed in the sauce with zucchini, carrots, celery and broccoli that was not overcooked.   It was much fresher, much tastier and not greasy compared to a Pei Wei bowl.   We shared some Rumbi fries too(see pics), half sweet potato and half regular, solid choice, nice and crisp.   The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was very clean.  It's nice to know I have another accidentally vegan option out there, I will go back.

What a nice surprise! My car was actually washed at a car wash!  So I drove up , a nice man help me choose which wash to get on the drive up teller like screen. I drive around the corner and am stopped just before entry to the drive through wash, where a guy sprays my windshield with some pretty potent bug dissolver and pre-soaks the rest of the car and tires as well, I then drive through the tunnel of wash and when I exit, I get hand dried and armour-all jet sprayed on my tires.   Very Fast and Very Clean! .........Very Impressed!   Minus one star because they don't do inside, but that's OK I keep it pretty clean!

Thanks to Amy D. for also introducing me to this quaint joint.  The smell of home cooking lured me in, Great menu selections with sandwiches salads and hot dishes too, along with the daily specials which I think is one of each (sandwich , salad, hot meal).  Sandwiches come with fresh potato chips and a pickle spear, I decided to try the Tuna since they don't put onions in it ,Hallelujah!(see pics)  You know what it was pretty tasty, I even ate all my chips and the pickle! My only complaint was the bread was a tad dry, but hey it happens.  Tucked into a commercial business park I never would have found this on my own, but I have fantasized about going back next time I'm in the area, Maybe Amy D. will take me out to lunch again :)

I'm so disappointed with this Location!  I have been here more than 5 times now,and each and every time the cookies have not been properly baked!  Underdone and or old! I can tell just by looking at them,I don't know why I continue to waste my money here.  I gave them a chance being that they were new, but their cooks really need to get a clue, none of the other locations I have been to have a problem with their cookies only this one!  I will not go back here for cookies or anything else!

*UPDATE*  I went in to grab a red velvet cupcake, same as before, DRY, think about biting into a brand new dry sponge, that's exactly the way the cake felt in my mouth and not only that but I looked in the mirror and my mouth and teeth were all red....eeeewwww......No I did not eat the flower on top, this was from the dye added to the cake...somebody doesn't know how to make TRUE Red Velvet.  I'll never go back here! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I Just noticed this tiny place peeking out of the strip mall today.  It's a really cute little Cake Cafe, my first clue was the name. Upon entering it smelled sweet, inviting comfy chairs, a few bistro tables a wall of gift items and A smiling host.  I asked about the cupcakes in the display case, there were so many to choose from. Every fruit flavor and chocolate combo you can think of, only butter-cream frosting here though, No Whip Cream which is my Favorite.   I decided on a Red Velvet and a Carrot Cake both with the cream cheese frosting. (see pics)  They were good. Nothing spectacular or out of this world, more ordinary and bit dry. I definitely blow her carrot cake outta the water, outta the desert for that matter.  But for $2 each it was a nice end to my earlier lunch.  I don't know that I'll be rushing back, but if I'm desperate for dessert and am low on cash I can stop here and get my needs met.

I'm always on the Lookout for Nice Cigar shops, as my Husband has become quite fond of them and I like to bring them home and surprise him.  This shoppe was particularly nice because not only did it have a large walk in with tons of cigars (see pics)  They also had a nice selection of table top Humidor boxes, a couple large standing Humidor cases, a variety of other accessories and the best part, A dedicated Smoking Lounge in the  back complete with Plasma TV and several leather chairs and  a couch.  If you are in need they also rent Humidor Lockers.

I stopped in today, Loving the cute decor and bright colors!!(see pics)  Like Halley said they only have the two flavors, original (tart) and Green tea which is also tart, I didn't like the green tea though. Typical assortment of dried and fresh fruit toppings.  They also offer smoothies and Bingsoo which is shaved ice with frozen yogurt on top.  You can use Free Internet  when you buy a yogurt and we were  offered  complimentary toast as well .............Hmmm toast and fro yo  I'm not sure I'm on that train but who knows it might be a match made in heaven.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed though, while the icy texture was there it really was not as tart as I would have liked it to be.  3.5 stars

YAY! I Found another Tart Treat!  This place is located in the shops of San Tan Village it's well hidden on a back corner behind Fossil, no wonder I have missed it every time I've been there. I just happened to see the name on the map and decided to give it a try.  Refreshing Real Yogurt Flavors, Plain (tart), peach, strawberry, raspberry and green tea. Fresh fruit and dry toppings. You can also get your yogurt blended into a drink.  I got the plain with strawberries of course(see pics) and it was perfectly creamy and icy with just the right amount of tart. I also tasted the peach and it was equally good with the subtlety of fresh peaches in a tart yogurt base.  I was told they have plans for 5 more location around the Valley I can't wait.

My first trip was for lunch.   My waiter sold me on the Lunch Special (fried shrimp and crab cakes with pineapple salsa, (see pics)$ 15   But I Love quiche so I had to order that too (see pics) $10   Thank God I ordered both, these were smaller than appetizers, I was told that Lunch had full size portions? O well I guess~ at least it was really good.~ Although I did have a problem with the shrimp, it tasted like cleaner, they brought me a couple more crab-cakes instead.   side note*= tables have no salt, pepper or sweeteners, I ordered an ice tea and still was not offered any sugar.    Second trip Brunch= I had already made reservations for brunch prior to my first visit.   So here we are again no salt and pepper or sweeteners, there was 3 of us and only two table setting up until right before our food came out.   Ordered Ice tea and still had to ask for sweeteners.   What we ordered:   Ham and biscuits=Fresh Baked Biscuits, Virginia Ham, Poached Eggs, Champagne Hollandaise (see pics) $12  The "ham" was not ham but extremely cheap and salty prosciutto, I put it aside, the rest was quite good although rather tiny.  I informed the waiter , he comes back with the chefs apologies and some lame excuse saying "well its American prosciutto that's why we call it ham" WTH the menu says Virginia ham?   Virginia Ham Monte Cristo=Edwards and Sons Ham, Sourdough French Toast, Swiss Cheese (see pics) $11.  Very Good, probably the best thing between us all and it had the ham that it described.   Sunny Side Up Eggs=Organic Eggs, Smoked Bacon, Hash Browns (see pics) $9 This was not on the kids menu by the way and very sadly it was served with Denny's hash-browns, this is a fancier restaurant shouldn't those be taboo??   Buttermilk Pancakes=House-made Butter, Fig and Peach Syrup (see pics) $10  They tasted good but that does not make up for the fact that they were served with NO BUTTER and COLD SYRUP and a little burnt as you can see!!!   Let me sum it all up for you:     Ham and biscuits................. $12  Virginia Ham Monte Cristo.....$11  Sunny Side Up Eggs............$9  Buttermilk Pancakes...........$10     Having to go somewhere else for breakfast after brunch..........PRICELESS!!!   I really have mixed feelings about this place, because the food is quite good but really overpriced for the portion size. I mean I do go to a restaurant to EAT for God's Sake!  It might be cheaper to invest in a Lap Band Surgery than to try and go here and get full.  I have to go with 2.5 stars

Located in Fulton Ranch, a fairly new upscale shopping center including an AJ's, Sautee seemed to be trying too hard and in some cases not hard enough.  I stopped in for an impromptu lunch, even though I was still slightly full from breakfast. Oh I hate it when i go somewhere new and everything sounds good and I don't know what to order, so I thought I'd try a few different things.  Pretty expensive entrees, up to $29.95! Moderately priced salads and sandwiches around the $10 range.  I decided to start with the Fried Calamari, soaked in buttermilk for maximum tenderness these thick and juicy strips were melt in your mouth bliss.(see pics)  The accompaniment sauces however were not a good match, chipotle chile, tasted like spicy BBQ and the key lime red pepper was like a sweetened thinned out mayo, I didn't detect any lime flavor in there at all, I ended up asking for lemon wedges which were just what those babies needed, YUM!  I also ordered the Chicken Satay skewers served with spicy tangerine sauce, these were tasty and the sauce was perfect match(see pics)  The last thing I tried was one of their Fire Grilled Flat-breads, I chose the "of the day" flavor which was urban chicken, with spinach, mushroom and smoked gouda (see pics)  Not impressed at all, I can guarantee this was not made to order, my toppings slid around under a thick blanket of dried cheese, meaning it was melted sometime before I ever ordered it. I only took two bites.  My waiter service was good, I was visited in total by 3 different waiters(?) all who asked how everything was and I expressed to each of them my dislike of the pizza.   Unfortunately none of them offered to get me something else or remove it from my bill~which is the courteous standard at most restaurants~especially NEW ones.  The pizza was even boxed  up for me, why would I want to take home something I didn't like? I told him to toss it.  I'm not sure if I would come back here or not, maybe to try a salad, but I'm not going to chance spending $30 on entree that I might not like.

I have really been craving Greek food and I was in the area so I thought I'd give this new place a try.  I decided on getting their variety platter which consisted of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Dolmades, Spanakopita and Falafel served with pita bread.(see pics)  Oh how disappointing!  *Strike 1~ The baba ganoush was over pureed into a thin slimy goo, it didn't taste very good either. All the baba ganoush I have ever eaten has been thick and had some texture left to it with a very distinct flavoring. This was the worst I've ever had.  *Strike 2~ The Hummus was gritty and bland. I was really looking forward to the strong garlicky lemon taste, none of that here though. Again another worst ever.  *Strike 3~ The Dolmades(grape leaves) smothered in a thick tomato and lemon slime, had the mushiest, yet sticky and pasty rice inside, it was awful. I grew up on these and actually make them quite often(grandmas secret recipe), so I think I know what I'm talking about.  I've had bad grape leaves but these take the cake.  *Your OUT!~ The Falafel, well you can see from the picture they look more like cookies, but nowhere near as good. They were more like fried wet sand , dry with no flavor at all. I wouldn't feed these to my dog.  The Spanakopita might have been the most edible part of this platter but by then it was too late, They had already been way past striking out in my book.  I tell the waitress and she sends over the manager, to whom I explained why I was unhappy with my meal. She apologizes but the has the nerve to ask me: "WELL, ARE YOU GREEK?!!!"  As a matter of fact YES I AM, I should be asking her that!  I know good Greek when I eat it and especially when I make it myself with recipes taught to me by own Grandmother, and sorry honey but that wasn't it!  I gave 2 stars only because she took it off my bill. OPA!

Revolving Sushi bar and Fine Japanese dining~ That's what the sign says.  Cool little color coded plates of sushi ride around on a moving belt before your eyes. Small portions make it easy to keep grabbing plates, then they add up the colors at the end and bring your check.  White= $1.25 Yellow=$ 1.75 Green=$ 2.25 Brown=$ 2.75 Black=$ 3.25  There is everything from Egg to shrimp and tuna etc. in 2 pieces and all kinds of rolls in 4 pieces, even little desserts go by. Also a small menu with tempura ,teriyaki, salads etc.  Don't see what you want? Just ask and they will make it appear!  I had a crunch roll and tuna avocado roll and an order of tuna (see pics) + drink and a tip was only $10.  Was the sushi Good? ~ it was OK (for $2 I can't complain), I liked the crunch roll, the tuna wasn't cut properly with the grain so you couldn't easily bite a piece off.  I don't know that they should be calling themselves  "Fine Dining" it's about as FINE as McDonald's if you know what I mean.  Don't go here here for quality sushi or atmosphere, go because you want sushi and only have $5 bucks to your name.  2.5 stars

I haven't been to A Good Egg in years.  This is a new Location in the Fulton Ranch/Sun Lakes area.  Went early for breakfast,  I ordered the Nurse's Bialy Breakfast which is 3 egg whites scrambled with turkey , spinach and tomatoes served with a toasted Bialy, low fat cream cheese and a cup of fruit. I also ordered one pancake with bananas and blueberry's (see pics)  I Like that you can customize your pancakes, they have a bout 25 different fruit, nut and chip choices to choose from  It was all deliciously, hot and fresh! Great way to start my Mothers day morning.  The Mr. ordered the Eye Opener Combo which he got with 2 pancakes 4 strips of bacon and 2 scrambled eggs(see pics)  I forgot how much I liked this place ,well when its not filled with screaming kids banging spoons, flinging jelly and slurping chocolate milk.   I'll be adding this to my favorite breakfast places and I'll have to try their lunches sometime too.

I went back for Lunch Today and it was Delicious! I ordered the Tuna sandwich with soup, Guest had the Turkey Bialy with fruit (see pics)   All of their sandwiches come with your choice of home-fried potatoes, soup,salad, black beans, fruit or coleslaw and are also generously garnished with and orange slice, a watermelon triangle and a pickle spear.  They also have a punch card so every 6Th meal is FREE....I got FREE Lunch Today!

If you want to go somewhere that you will be welcomed like family, remembered as a friend and valued as a customer then 24 Carrots should be your next stop.  The Cafe is cozy and comfortable, I feel like I'm going over to a good friends house every time I stop by.  You can sit and relax and share wonderful conversations, ideas and recipes with Sasha. If there is anything she can do for you she probably will, Sasha has the sweetest kindest spirit and it really reflects into her food.   There couldn't be more love and passion put into her food if your grandmother made it.   I've simply Loved everything I've ever ordered here. The menu has some solid choices but for me the magic lies in the daily specials.  Everyday Sasha creates something new and exciting to tantalize your taste buds using fresh locally grown organic produce.   You can follow 24 Carrots on twitter and facebook to hear what she's cooking up next.

I'll start off with the old saying "You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression" Please read on.  I dove and hour to get here! I was so excited to find another tart yogurt shop! Decor is minimal but tends to follow the same theme as far as these types of places go.  I order a small tart with strawberry and kiwi (see pics)  It had a nice creamy texture but not quite tart enough , I though the first couple of bites were tarty but then it just died off.   Low and behold tell tale sign of cheapskateyness and robbing the customer was the hollow center of my yogurt (see pics) I really hate that and this is the biggest hole so far.  My daughter got a small tart no toppings or so she thought, mid way through eating she uncovered ..............a pickle hair, pube, short and curly, whatever you want to call it. What a monumental Vomit Factor came into play here, did this have anything to do with the creaminess?   UGH!  He apologized and refunded our money and assured us it was too short to be his hair.  But when you think about How does a pube accidentally make it way into a frozen yogurt batch? A bug maybe , but a Pube No Way!!  I don't think I'll be driving outta my way to go here again.

You know me and my spontaneous pullovers when I see a bakery sign.  Today I was pleasantly surprised, I have never been to an authentic Mexican Bakery.  I felt a little intimidated not knowing what things were even though everything looked amazing.The names were in Spanish but not the prices. I'm telling you, what a steal they were! I have never seen such delicacies at prices that even a child could afford.  I Mean look at this Gorgeous not to mention Scrumptious "Encocado" (see pics)........brace your self...... it was .75 cents!!!!!!!   Layers of flaky pastry topped with toasted coconut and sugar, finished of with a dollop of Bavarian cream. DO you even know what Heaven tastes like, I do now.   I also got and equally scrumptious "Riel de Queso" only $1.25 and OMG insanely good, crispy and tender pastry filled with cream cheese has got to be one of my favorites and this was out of this world! (see pics)  Miguel the owner has been in the family business since he was 10 years old, this location, open for 7 months, is a branch off from the original location in Glendale that has been opened for 25 years.  Miguel was extremely friendly and explained what all the  tempting treats were, they do custom orders, platters and cakes along with homemade tortillas and red and green chile.   Stop in help support a true local gem. You will be hooked I guarantee it!  Located in the same strip mall as The French Bee ** Hours are Tuesday -Saturday 7am to 7pm     Sunday 7am to 1pm      CLOSED on Mondays

I've had my eye on this place before it even opened and finally got the chance to check it out!   Inside is just BEAUTIFUL (see pics) An upscale but casual feel. They also have a spacious patio area.  All the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly and informative.   I ordered an Ice Tea........it was good.  They served me hot crusty bread with these Fabulous Rosemary Cheese Crisps.......I asked for more they were so good!! ;-) (see pics)   The waitress told me I could modify any item on the menu if I needed to or special order anything I didn't see....   ..that is a HUGE plus when a place is willing to go above and beyond to accommodate you and also means they obviously are preparing these items fresh if they can change any item. I definitely appreciate that.   I decided on ordering the Roasted Chicken and Butternut squash risotto, Lunch portion comes with salad. (see pics)   OMG.....SO Delicious and piping HOT, it had such amazing flavor depth, topped with crisp prosciutto and fresh basil chiffonade.   I was in heaven, I'm gonna dream about that dish for sure!   Now for dessert, they offer about ten different things in a mini teacup size...........WOW! That is so cool, you can try more than one thing without being a total pig or spending a fortune! LOVE IT!!   I decided on one of the many creme brulee' flavors, I got the brown sugar (see pics) Perfect size Perfect Flavor, truly!  I noticed on their website that they serve a Brunch menu on the weekends until 3pm. I'd like to try that as well.  http://www.brioitalian.com/  I honestly can't wait to go back!!

I never would have thought I'd have so much fun!  You choose from a wall of blank pottery, from cups to dishes ,jewelry boxes to dog bowls, frames, statues, lamps and clocks, and they have all the tools you need to paint and decorate till your hearts content.  Leave your piece to be glazed and fired and you can pick it up in a few days!  The staff are great, super friendly and helpful!  You can even order pieces to be custom painted and you wont even have to get your hands dirty.   Any of the pieces would make a great gift, made from the heart!  This is great for kids and adults and even more fun with groups, (small UYE anyone??) Take your out of town guests to make a souvenir of their time spent with you!  Make a reservation because they can fill up quick.  I don't know what else to say except, TRY IT YOU'LL LOVE IT! I can't wait to go back again and again!!   **I will post pics when I get my pieces back!

OK so after reading the obviously fake "first review" I thought I'd check it out, I mean Heck who doesn't Love a cupcake!  I walk in, wasn't greeted, The counter girl had the personality and social skills of a Sloth. I asked a few questions about the store and the cupcakes and all I got was a "yeah" and a blank stare.  I decided on a Lemon and a Red Velvet.  I wasn't even asked if I would like to eat in their rather large and empty seating area, instead I was handed a paper bag with my two cupcakes snuggled inside(not even a box)............WTH.................. I would have liked to been able to sit down and eat these  with a fork. She didn't even give me a napkin or direct me to silverware and there were none around that I could see, so I just left.  In the car I eagerly took out my cakes,   Red Velvet= if this cake was any drier it would be Phoenix and the supposed cream cheese frosting was all powder sugar and nasty sweet.  Lemon= just as unappealing as the RedV, Maybe I should open my own Cupcake shop??? Or a cupcake Workshop even, and teach these posers a thing or 10!  I'll give an A for effort because the place is really cute but it stops there.  In the style of the Soup Nazi, I declare  "No Stars For You!"

Not Impressed at all!  Had it not been for the gift card I had I probably would have never went here and after this visit I doubt I'll return.   I'll just cut to the chase, they say they have fresh fish and seafood,  well if those coconut shrimp I ordered were "Fresh" Then I'm the Gorton's Fisherman!  I'm sorry but those were sadly frozen Sea-Pak (see pics) the sauce and mango salsa were atrocious.   My Salmon Club sandwich was OK (see pics) but the gunk in the center of the plate was a very poor excuse for some sort of salad, think cafeteria salad bar.  The Cheeseburger my daughter ordered arrived well done even though she ordered it medium. She says it was ok but far from the best she's had.  From the looks of the restaurant I expected Much Better quality of food. Oh Well, at least I know where not to spend my money.

I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.   I LOVE it!   I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there.   The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!   My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!  Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)  Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!!   I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!!  2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes!   Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!

It was my first time at the market, I spent the day there at Kids Korner Hanging out with Gabi decorating Yelp Bags. The kids booth is just as busy as any of the other vendors it was a lot of fun!   I made a few laps and was really happy to see all the fresh produce and food items. I bought organic golden beets, tri-colored carrots, broccoli, butternut squash, meyer lemons, sweet potatoes, romaine and something that I don't even remember what it is ;-) at McClendons.   I tried some amazing vegan tamales....SOLD! I'm not even vegan but they were delicious with corn, spinach and mushrooms.   I had an equally delicious Raw Organic Vegan wrap from Chef Sarah's booth (not me) (see pics) It had Almond Hummus, Tapenade, and a bunch of veggies and greens all wrapped up in a collard green leaf.   I also bought 3 loaves of bread from the Phoenicians IL Terrazzo.  A Rosemary, A Pecan, Raisin and Currant and Ridiculously tasty Chocolate Cherry Sourdough which didn't even make it through the night!   I topped it all off with a scoop of Love in the form of Basil Lime Sorbet from Sweet Republic.   It was a great day and I will be back!

I came in to the Joya Salon and made an appointment for a Polish Change since the manicure I had gotten the day before did not last and my polish was already coming off.   Rebbecca (Becky) was my Nail Technician, she was really nice, offered me Ice Tea which was Delicious Hibiscus Raspberry (China Mist).   The Salon was very nice and relaxing. Once I decided on a color she took care of my nails, did an excellent job and they are still looking pretty after 3 days.   The spa/salon offers a 15% discount on all services to local residences.   Upon checkout I realized I was charged for a Petite Manicure, no wonder I got a little massage and the whole works.   My service was excellent, however, when I made the appointment for a polish change I feel I should have been told "we do not offer only polish change, however we do a petite manicure...."  Like I said I had a manicure the day before I didn't need another one I just wanted my nails painted and that would have been nice to know.   I enjoyed my visit though and can't wait to return to try some other services.

LUNCH:   Came here for a late lunch pre-dinner snack. Even though it was prior to Happy Hour we were still offered to order from the Tapas menu.   We decided to share the Blue Prawn BLT sandwich from the Lunch menu and the Fried Calamari from the Tapas menu (see pics)   The Sandwich was just Delicious I loved every bite of the chewy ciabatta, the butter lettuce, pimento spread, the tender grilled prawns and the flavorful bacon! The accompanying fries were Hot, Fresh and Tasty Crisp too!   The Calamari was Very Fresh and Tender, loved that as well!   The waiter was oblivious and had to be waved down just so we could pay and get out of there.  We were one of 2 or 3 couples in the restaurant at this time and service was painfully slow, Thank God for the generous bread basket, which by the way had several varieties of fresh bread with olive oil for dipping.   DINNER:   The Bar was packed with obvious locals dining on HH Tapas and drinks. The restaurant itself was pretty full as well.   We were seated right away and greeted by our server Ashley who despite being very busy took very good care of us and was very knowledgeable about the menu.   We started with a Wild Arugula Salad and Fried Zucchini Blossoms. (see pics)  Both were Absolutely Divine. The salad was lightly dressed and served atop this thin crisp bread/cracker then topped with tomato and Spanish cheese I would liken to a more pungent Parmesan. Delicious!   The Squash Blossom were filled with Ricotta, Mozzarella and Salami....WOW! These were Amazingly Tasty I wish there were more of them!   For our Entrees My Husband chose the Rigatoni with Bacon and I chose the Pork Chop (see pics)   Ashley our server explained that this was Carabuda Pork, the finest Pig in the world and let me tell you it did not disappoint!   Served on top of brown rice with toasted pine nuts and figs drizzled with grape must, it was just unbelievably good, better than a steak. I highly recommend it, my husband loved it as well, I shared with him and he was just in awe of how good it was.   His pasta was delicious as well with fresh tomato sauce, basil and bacon! Yum!   For we ordered the Churros and a Peach Tart (see pics)   If you've never had a fresh churro you don't know what your missing! OMG! They were Fabulous! The Peach tart was quite yummy too though I though it could have used more peaches!    BREAKFAST BUFFET:   On the weekend they serve the buffet with a couple menu items.  It was just OK, their fresh fruit was good, the omelet bar was so-so, service again was slow, waiting for drink and salt and pepper, they were missing bowls for the oatmeal.  Not much to say here.   WRAP UP:   I would absolutely eat here again just not for breakfast. Dinner was Amazing and our lunch was Delicious too despite waiting a bit too ling.  I must give 5 stars for our food during dinner though!

What's that you say? A VEGAN going to a Brazilian Steakhouse? How can this be?   Two Words: SALAD BAR!   Set in a Fine Dining Atmosphere Fogo De Chao offers a Pristine Salad Bar fit for a Vegan Queen. Choices like Brazilian Hearts of Palm, Whole Shitake Mushrooms, Jumbo Asparagus, Whole Artichoke Hearts, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Butter Lettuce and the list goes on and on.   Some of the traditional side dishes are also vegan safe like the fried bananas and also the fried polenta with no cheese. Both are very delicious!   Trust me you wont leave hungry. I've been twice now and would gladly dine here again anytime!  P.S.  The staff was incredible, our service was flawless and, we were completely taken care of every second of our visit.

Still one of my favorite places for breakfast.   The new location is OK, I've had some minor issues during lunch time but our breakfast the other day was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!  I Love the California Benny, An English muffin layered with spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes and two large poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce, Served with Crackers Country Potatoes(see pics)   The Husband always gets the Vatican Skillet which is A layer of Crackers Country Potatoes mixed with breakfast sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, topped with cheddar cheese and two eggs any style (see pics) with a side of pancakes instead of toast, I think it's .99 cents more.  Crackers is just a great place for home cooking with a huge menu and tons of dessert, I have several favorites! Check it out I think you'll agree.  Open 7am -2:30pm.

I can't believe I haven't tried this yet, I've walked by it so many times!   Today I was hoping to grab a tea from tea infusion and they were closed (as usual) I decided to get yogurt instead.   There were some weird bars in the middle of the place?   Serve your self, one size cups (huge ones), beautiful fresh fruit and a ton of dry toppings.   I wish they would make smaller cups, I guess they want you to "Fill UP"   I took care not to put too much in my cup and did  half tart half pistachio, sprinkled a few black berries, strawberries and the crunchiest pop in your mouth blueberries. it was $4.27. I guess I put more than I thought.   It was an amazing flavor combination and the fruit was really fresh, I LOVED it.   The tart was not very tart though, but that's OK.   I will be back for more ;-)

I was in the area yesterday wondering what to have for lunch when I remembered that I wanted to try Chestnut Lane, my first trip here they were closed for vacation, so now was my chance.   The parking lot is home to many businesses so you will be lucky if you can find a spot, I had to park in the back alley.   I couldn't even enter when I walked up to the door due to the large crowed of people who arrived before me.  This place is TINY but in the cutest homey kind of way.  Finally being able to creep into the doorway I eyed their salad case, which I have to say was the most visually stunning salad case I've ever laid my eyes on. Everything was so beautifully displayed and fresh looking. I knew I would have a hard time making up my mind.   The girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful, she even offered me a tasting of one of the new salads they just brought out to see if I liked it.  In the end I decided on the Chestnut Lane Chopped Salad (see pics) which was grilled natural chicken breast, corn, local tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, feta cheese, pumpkin seeds  and chopped greens tossed with a balsamic vinaigrette.   My initial thought was how small it seemed for $12 but once I started eating it I was really pleased, it was just Delicious!  Every bite was full of flavor without being too heavily dressed and it even filled me up, although my inner pig would have liked to eat twice as much!   If I ever had my own little cafe it would be a lot like this, I cant wait to return to try more!

I have to start by saying I give an "A" for effort in being an independent business.  BUT and there' s a big BUT and no it's not mine, the ice cream is not good.   I stopped in today after looking all over Hell and having to call for an exact location, which by the way is near an Auto Zone not Discount Tires like I was told.   Big sign out front says $1 scoops today! Cool!  Inside is a decent looking, average place with all kinds of random things that are sold here.   I'm told they make all their own ice cream right in the store with their own recipes along with their own cheeses and butters.   They have a lot of flavors, set up like cold stone. Pistachio was an ungodly hue of turquoise that I didn't even want to taste because of the color and normally that is my favorite.   I tried three flavors, Key Lime Pie, Blueberry and Chocolate Cake Batter. All three had the same chalky taste and after taste, very unappealing and just plain weird.   When I asked about the $1 scoops I was told they were in the self serve freezer and were prepacked scoops. I took a look to find that these were hard as a rock and mentioned how was I supposed to eat something like that?? I was told to let it thaw.....OK when I go in for Ice Cream I kinda want to eat it right away. Whose with me?   Anyway I ended up leaving without getting anything.   I love to support the locals but not if I can go buy something better at the grocery store or any other chain for that matter.   Sorry Udder delights, You left me Utterly Disappointed.

After trying their Salsa, Guacamole and Ceviche at the Yelp Event, I couldn't get it out of my mind, it was so good, so I went to have lunch here today!   Let me tell you How Amazing our food was!!!   To start I ordered the custom Guacamole, they give you a list of ingredients and you check which ones you would like, I chose everything except onions and word to the wise, do yourself a favor and make sure you get the pomegranates (see pics)  WOW OH WOW, that was the Best Guacamole I've ever had, seriously!!!   For my entree I decided to order the Acapulco Shrimp Ceviche (see pics)  It was Delicious just like it was at the event.   I also ordered the Chicken Taquitos (see pics) OMGosh! These were absolutely the highlight of the meal, definitely not what I was expecting and I mean that in the best way possible!  Freshly stuffed with shredded chicken and bacon and then rolled and fried to a golden crisp, yet they were so delicate and flavorful.  I would go here again and again just to order these babies!   My hubby ordered their cheese enchiladas with two fried eggs on top, which they were more than willing to accommodate him with even though it was not on the menu. (Sorry No pics), but he LOVED every bite, only problem was he wished they had been served with a bit more of their tasty charro beans.   And despite getting the generous discount card from the event last night (get $15 off $40) We didn't even hit $40 dollars ordering all that! I think their prices are very fair, especially for the quality and amount of food.   My only complaint was, the place was still Bombay Spice-ish, decor and music wise. -1 star    Please go get some decorations to liven up the place and give it some character along with playing some more fitting music, I'm not talking mariachi or anything but some Island beats would have been better suited than Loungey dance music.   **The Food was a definite 5 stars for me though**

With a name like BACON it better be good!   I saw this place a couple weeks ago and thought I'd go give it a try.   I liked the inside, it was pretty casual with big comfy denim booths and red checker table cloths.   They serve breakfast and lunch, the menu looked good (not that actual menu mind you, it was just a sloppily thrown together piece of photocopied paper). I was hoping for the best.   So they don't have diet coke.........   I order the BLT+2 fried eggs breakfast sandwich, (see pics)  The menu says its served with home fries and baked beans..............  I got no beans.   Everything looked wonderful as you can see.....  The potatoes were awful and I was bummed, they tasted very very old.   Seriously what's your name again BACON?   I should be biting into the tastiest most succulent bacon to ever grace the lips of anyone but unfortunately this BACON was the most flavorless lackluster BACON on the planet.  The whole sandwich was just so bland, I found myself reaching for the salt shaker and I NEVER put salt on my food.  Oh and Please don't put old soggy tomatoes on my sandwich again, Thanks.   I hadn't eaten after my workout and a few errands I had to run so I obviously ate the sandwich, not the potatoes though, but I Still cant get over the fact of how it had no flavor.  For now I'll have to say 2.5 stars,  like the old saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  But to be fair I would possibly go again and try something from the lunch menu because honestly this place has tons of potential and room for improvement, I hope they succeed

The Original Twangy Tart that made my heart go Buck Wild ...............   Yeah, that was the Original Location also.......   This new one, not so much as a pitter patter.   They were having a Grand Opening special, all orders 50% off so that was cool.   It's Very Small and you Serve Yourself now, too bad the fruit wasn't looking very fresh.   The Twangy Tart was anything but.   Seriously it just tasted like plain milk, no twang.   The Creamy Blueberry, not so creamy but very tarty, almost in a pixie stix kinda away, actually that's exactly what it tasted like.   Sadly I don't think I'd come here again given the other options I have for frozen yogurt.   Sorry Ice Tango.

By far one of my Favorite Restaurants to eat Vegan at.  I can't believe I haven't updated my review, the first time I reviewed Gallo I was not even Vegan, it's been a long time.   The Veggie Tacos are out of this world, I usually order 5 or 6.  They are pretty small in size but not in flavor. Fresh tiny corn tortillas stuffed with a varying mixture of grilled veggies like, onion, red pepper, green beans, mushroom, corn and spinach topped with guacamole and the best part is they are only $2 each WHAT!! That's right only $2 each.   It gets better, during Happy Hour which is now 7days a week from  3pm-6pm, My beloved Veggie Tacos are only.......wait for it.........$1 each!!   Not to mention the $5 (HH price) made to order Guacamole, loaded with roasted tomatoes, chunks of citrus and spices, (be sure to say No Cheese if you are a Vegan.) It's my professional opinion that this is some of the best Guacamole I've had, try it f you don't believe me.  All this talking has got me craving it, I gotta go, See you at Gallo!

I enjoyed meeting Gabi and some other Yelpers for  "Office Hours" here today.   I liked the space, the bathroom was clean and cool, the staff was friendly and both my hot beverages were great.   I enjoyed a Hot Chocolate and then a cup of the "peace on earth" tea which I preferred over the HC.   The tea was perfect and decaffeinated, I didn't even need to add anything to it. I don't remember what exactly the tea was made up with but I'm sure I will be back just to enjoy another cup.   Only drawbacks for me are, parking is limited and they don't serve any lunch items but other than that its a great spot!

I Loved everything about this place from the moment I walked through the garden/patio entrance.  They actually grow an assortment of their own vegetables right on their own patio, how cool is that! Not to mention it's a very inviting space.   Inside was no different, it was modern and hip but comfortable too.   I was pleased with the menu, descriptive offerings reasonably priced.   My friend and I ordered the Arancini which is Fried Risotto Balls with cheese snuggled on a bed of pomodoro sauce (see pics) These are just Delicious!! You could make a meal of these I wish the serving was larger.   I also ordered the Funghi Pizza that had Wild Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Truffle Oil and Chives. Yum Yum! (see pics) At 8in. it was easy to eat by myself, but would have been plenty to share as well.  The goat Cheese gave it just the flavor it needed to be great, some fresh herbs would have only improved it's greatness.   My friend did the build your own pizza and got Spinach, Tomato and Basil, my battery died so no pics, sorry. We swapped slices and I really liked hers as well.   I had other plans for dessert so we didn't order here but I know I will be back, they have so many fabulous items I want to try and I just love the space too.   They said they were working on updating the website to include the menu so hopefully soon you will be able to click and drool, but for now read these reviews and look at the pics, then head immediately over to The Parlor!   Just a Tip: It's located directly across the street from Best Buy on Camelback and 20thST, it's easy to miss, but that should help you find it!

I too was lured in by the tasty sample, however I was never told that I could buy single cup of tea to go and drink, I would have liked to do that at least.  I was instead told that minimum tea purchase was 2.oz. and the tea that I was interested in would have cost me around $20!  NO THANKS.   I don't need that much tea and seriously am not going to save soggy leaves to re-steep another time.   I would have liked to buy just enough for a few glasses of tea.   Sorry Teavana I will be going elsewhere.

Another Frozen Yogurt Joint..........   They have similar setup as most places now days, serve your self, $.39 cents per oz .   Original Tart and a handful of other flavors.  I tried a sample of the Taro flavor, it was interesting.   Then decided on the Original Tart and Blueberry.  The Tart was not tart at all and the blueberry which wasn't sugar free and all natural was way too sweet, go figure.   I did not enjoy it and I was bummed.  They did have fresh fruit though :-)   They are brand new maybe things will change.   I'm sure there will be people who will enjoy this yogurt but it's not one of my favorites.

I'm all about getting my rear in gear! I just love a good work out and The Dailey Method definitely delivers!  Thank You Gabi K. for introducing me to a Kick Ass work out!  This routine is like nothing I've ever done before and I won't lie, it was tough at times, but in a good way of course.  You will be proud of yourself and feel good leaving here.  Linda the owner is just as sweet as can be, she made me feel really welcome and Dawn the instructor that taught the class I was in  was just a sweetheart as well.  I loved the space, it was bright and clean.  They have two large bathrooms with lockers, showers and all the toiletries, towels and blow dryers etc. that you will be needing after a hard core work out!   Just a few notes: *You will need non slip socks for this workout, you can buy a pair here for $10! *No excuses Ladies, they have child care!! Only $6! *Great rates for new clients, you can't pass up a good deal! * Your body will thank you, what are you waiting for?!!!  If you are looking for a fun new way to get your body into shape I highly recommend you try TDM.

If you've seen one you've seen them all. Here is another do it yourself yogurt station.   Grand Opening was Yesterday July 21st, spend $10 and get a Free T-shirt while supplies last!   They had a ton of toppings to choose from ,some I've not seen done yet like those pink and white sprinkled animal cookies, vanilla wafers and ginger snaps to name a few, Yum!  I liked it! I got pistachio and tart strawberry, no toppings.  The pistachio was one of the best pistachio yogurts I've had.  When I'm in this area Yogurtland will be my go to place.

The Mr. wanted enchiladas, we were in the area, I agreed to try this place out, neither of us had ever been.  He proceeds to order cheese enchiladas with no onions and is told, everything is pre-made with onions!...WTF!!  I wanted to leave but he decided to try the Fajitas, I got a tostada and tortilla soup. Not even picture worthy. Tasted like premade crap, and La Victoria canned beans!  SO let's just play a fun game with the name here:  Sounds Like: Garcia's  BARFcia's GROSScia's Diarrhea's  I think you get the picture.......I would not recommend going here...

I was in the area and craving some Mexican food since it's getting cooler outside.   I will admit I went in here totally skeptical and ready to be disappointed ...........but you know what......I wasn't!!!   It was very clean, friendly and attentive staff, a window opened to the kitchen area to see the cooks in action.   I was served chips with a salsa trio, there was chunky pico de gallo, smooth red and the tomatillo green. (see pics)   All tasted OK, none were very spicy at all but that was fine with me.  My favorite was the green, although I added some salt and lemon juice to it to make more flavorful it still was a great fresh sauce, I could have eaten it with a spoon!  I ordered from the lunch menu, where all items were $6.99.  I chose the chicken melt it was a grilled tortilla topped with melted cheese ,grilled chicken, tomato and avocado, served with rice and beans (see pics)   Wow! A perfect light lunch that I didn't feel guilty eating, it was so good!   I have to give 4 stars based on my experience today, I will go back and hopefully thing will be as good next time too.

So glad Gabi chose this place for Lunch, but damn the rain for ruining our chance at the lovely patio dining.   Such cozy cuteness, I was beside myself. I just adored the pretty patio with all it's flowers, umbrellaed tables, heaters and even a roaring fireplace.  Inside was more CC, chandeliers over each table, dark wood, and my favorite part was the beautifully framed window, literally framed, but instead of a picture you look out the window to the lattice and creeping vines, so cool! Wish I would have taken a pic of that.   Several things on the menu wanted me to order them but I went with the Salmon Nicoise (see pics) It was not only beautiful but also delicious. Other guests ordered the Quiche and the Onion Soup (see pics) Both looked wonderful and I was told they were.   I have only one complaint and it's really just more of a disappointment than anything. On such a rainy cold day I was hoping they would have some decadent hot chocolate to warm me up but they did not......Maybe soon?  I went with hot tea instead and was pleasantly satisfied.   I will definitely return to try some more of the very reasonably priced French Fare.

I Love any place that I can get Lunch at 10:30am.   Vincents has a ton of different pizza by the slice all day everyday, plus a full menu of appetizers, entrees, salads and dessert, not to mention some family meal deals and they even deliver!!   I took advantage of their lunch menu several times already even though they just opened on August 19th.   I've tried 4 different kinds of pizza, the garlic knots, which by the way I saw them making and actually hand knotting the dough right there, and one of their chicken Parmesan rolls which is the chicken, sauce and cheese with dough wrapped around it than baked, really really tasty!   They have a lot to offer and I will probably gain 50 pounds if I keep going there but there is still so much more I want to try!  Check them out, they are right next to the AMC Theater on Ray Rd. and the I-10.

Click your heels three times and say,   "There's no place like this S P A C E",  and magically be transported into a place of peace, serenity and relaxation.  Instead of a busy Spa or Resort that makes the time about them why not escape to S P A C E and make the time about YOU.    You will be swept away by the very Cozy, Intimate and nothing less than Luxurious Massage Studio. John is a Master of his craft and is very attuned to delivering a treatment that is customized to you and your energy.  John genuinely cares about your experience and that is why there is no where else I'd rather go to escape for and hour of sheer bliss.

I never made it to Lisa G's but my visit to The Main Ingredient made me forget that.   Simple Menu, some apps, salads and sammies.   I ordered Sophie's Salad, easily made vegan with no cheese and no onion,......field greens, local tomatoes, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, red onion, toasted pine nuts & fresh basil tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.   I don't often get excited about salads but I was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion. It was dressed better than me and LOADED with artichokes, tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and basil.  There was no skimping on toppings or fishing through the greens for the goods, every bite was magic in my mouth.   I will be craving that salad in the near future and they've got a Veggie sandwich that I'd like to try as well. Can't wait to go back!

WOW! They have so many pizza's to choose from!  I LOVE the feature of just slices, there have been way too many times I was forced to eat a whole pizza.  The Slices are Huge too!  I immediately spotted potatoes on one pizza and knew I had to have it! VERY Yummy Indeed! Especially since they toss them back in the oven to crisp and the crust is so thin and delicious!!  So my Slice had potatoes, bacon and cheese, green onion!! (see pics)  I have to say it's my new favorite! This would be a great pizza to take home and put some scrambled eggs on top of the big foldable slices!  I didn't notice if the place was messy or not , but it sure was small, I chose to eat outside.  My only complaint would be, the plates. You are served a giant slice of pizza on the cheapest paper plate EVER!!  It might as well have been served on a paper towel, it was that flimsy!  If you love variety you'll love this place!

I have to upgrade a star, because for a SLICE place this is it!  I devoured 3 Slices of the Chicken Pesto, OMG that tang from the feta cheese was so damn good, it needed more if you asked me, I also picked off the chicken not that it was bad I just preferred it without (see pics)  Yum Yum!  Also a tip= I like to ask for my slice extra crisp!

Had lunch here for the first time and was pleased to know that everything is organic and vegan unless you choose to add dairy or eggs to the meal.   I ordered the Smokey Tempeh B.L. T. (see pics)   First of all the portion was HUGE! Generous helping of Exotic Veggie Chips and a side salad along with a sprinkling of cherries Plus this Amazing Sandwich. I do mean it was AAAMMAZIIIING!!  Seriously, the Tempeh Bacon was practically like tender BBQ Beef Brisket, it was quite a magical moment for my taste buds.   My salad came with a side of Living Caesar dressing, which is all raw vegan ingredients, it was a little spicy for my taste so I asked for the Pomegranate vinaigrette, YUM! Sweet, Tangy and a little zing from some fresh mint it was much more to my liking.   I'm just ecstatic that there is something so Veganly Delicious ( it's my review so I will make up words if I want to)) so close to home.   4 stars for now, until I try more items, but that sandwich was so 5 stars!

While the giant fish tank in the middle of the bar might blow you away, the sushi will NOT.   The HH menu is pretty limited compared to other places I've been. There is a bigger selection of drinks than their is food. There isn't even any veggie rolls on the HH menu!   I decided to try the Kimodo Dragon Cocktail. It was Bacardi Dragon Berry, muddled with strawberries grapes and basil, sounds good No?  NO is right, it was sickening sweet with artificial strawberry flavor( think Strawberry Lip-smacker) and NO and I mean NO hint of the Basil whatsoever.   Our waiter was a total Tool. He didn't bring us any water, He didn't bring us any Wasabi or Ginger, We had to flag him down for all of these things.  He Never even asked us how we were doing.   The Sushi was Cheap, price and quality. The rolls were loose and fell apart as soon as you picked them up. I mean it wasn't the worst sushi I've ever had but it was very generic and underwhelming.  One of the rolls we ordered that was not on the HH menu was the Stingray roll, it was spicy crab with cucumber topped with cilantro and jalapeno and some sauce on the side.  We were expecting something spicy. It was NOT. The sweet and sour sauce on the side did not help things, what was supposed to be cilantro and jalapeno looked and tasted like nothing more than chopped parsley and the "Crab" was actually "Krab" and they had the nerve to charge $11 for this. FAIL!

After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday.  Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs.   I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day.   I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway.   WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG!   This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric.   Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too!   P.S.  For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you.

Lets start with the drinks, shall we. After all, it was "miss katie's pimms cup" that lured me here, being vegan, food choice has become an after thought.  My drink, miss katie's pimms cup (pimm's #1, ketel one vodka,  muddled cucumber, ginger and sprite) was amazing. So refreshing, not too sweet, subtlety of cucumber and ginger, I could have drank these all night and it would have been worthy of 5 stars, but a girls gotta eat!  After I read the menu, and not only saw but smelled the delicious food coming out of the kitchen, I actually felt guilty for being Vegan. I too wanted to enjoy one of those mouthwatering meals.   However, Chef Justin had no qualms about catering to my needs. I was informed he was preparing something special for me. I do Love surprises.   It was quite a treat to have something so artfully presented to me. (see pics)  Not only was my dish Beautiful it was Delicious! It tasted of the same care that the signature dishes on the menu were made of.  It really says a lot about Chef Justins level of customer care that he went out of his way to prepare me something that was not just a bunch of sides thrown together on a plate. It was a well thought out dish from presentation to flavors. It was my pleasure to meet Chef Justin last night  and I can't thank him enough.   My husband had the Short Ribs (see pics), which he'll attest, were amazing, as well as the Fig and Pecan Pie (darn, no pic) that blew him away.  All put together with stellar service form Cort our server, it was a Wonderful evening that we will look forward to enjoying again and again.  P.S. I hear they will be adding  daily Vegan/Vegetarian/GF options to their menu by the new year. I cannot wait!

Sophie you were right!  OH! MY! GOD!  That doesn't even begin to cover it!   Very cute place, I sat in the center patio corridor with the market to the left and the dining room to the right.  Everything sounded so delicious! I decided on the Artichoke and White Bean Hummus and the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas which came with a wonderful salad (see pictures)  Every bite was delectable, I couldn't bear the thought of wasting so of course I finished every last bite of it all!  I know I must sound like a cow but unfortunately I'm lacking the 3 extra stomachs to take advantage of the rest of the menu.......those would have come in really handy because I didn't want to leave, I Was in Food Heaven!  Deliciously Fresh and Gourmet!  My 5 stars are for the food experience  The service was actually awful, as I had to get up to retrieve my own silverware and even help my self to the Ice tea pitcher because some one never refilled my glass!  They say Love is Blind right ,and I LOVED the Food so I'll over look the lazy service.

One of my Favorite things to do is go out to eat.  I had been eyeing this place's menu online for sometime. It sounded delicious and gourmet and I couldn't wait to try it.   The restaurant it self is totally cute and cozy like a place you'd take your Mom.  However it did not live up to my expectations whatsoever.   First we were served some cold eggbread rolls with rock hard butter, not worth eating at all!  You can tell alot about a place by the bread and butter they serve.   Next she brings out our meals, she gives me the strawberry salad, it was not what I ordered but it did look good, so after waiting awhile she brings me what I did order, the WILD MUSHROOM, SPINACH AND GOAT CHEESE TART ....all I can say is blah! not very good or gourmet so I was looking forward to the sandwich my daughter ordered: CALIFORNIA CLUB it said it came on rosemary focaccia which I love, but this bread was so thick, dry and flavorless,just plain gross and very skimpy on the filling for the sandwich too.   We had been drooling over their pastry platter the whole time thinking a LEMON CAKE COOKIE would end the meal on a good note...it tasted like a week old pancake with a little lemon icing on it.  I was very disappointed, I will not go back and waste my money.  This place is perfect for old drunk loud women, cause that's what it was full of while we were there.  The one star is for the being a cute place to look at, but I wouldn't eat there again.

My original review was written just over a year ago, so when I was invited to a baby shower here today I was hoping I would have a better experience.   I'll start by saying I added one star because it really is just a lovely place, it's too bad the food is so average, and that's being generous.   I got an iced tea............So over brewed and way too strong, almost bitter.   I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad (see pics) marinated and grilled shrimp, baby lettuces, diced avocado, baby tomatoes, goat cheese, grilled corn and lime vinaigrette topped with frizzled tortillas, sounds delicious no?   No is right! Seriously the vinaigrette was all oil, no lime or acidity at all, there wasn't enough of anything on the salad to get a good bite of all the flavors bland as they were, and the fried tortilla strips were old and very greasy, really a $14 salad should be nothing less than divine.   My daughter got the Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich (see pics) $12  albacore tuna, pecans, jicama, scallions, cucumbers and purple cabbage on sunflower , whole wheat bread with potato salad.   Again sounds Delicious but was less than stellar.   The Tuna mixture had a decent flavor but the tuna wasn't even mixed thoroughly, it was in large chunks straight from the can.   The potato salads potatoes were barley done, almost crunchy and lacking any flavor that would make me want to continue eating nearly raw potatoes.   The atmosphere isn't enough to intoxicate my senses into believing I'm eating something amazing. How unfortunate that so many can be blinded by a "trend" because the food is just not all that.

I want this pizza to be better than it is, if they could change a few things it probably would be as good as they claim.   I gave them a fair shake and waited to write this review after ordering from them 4 times.   Thin crust Pizza should be CRISP, mine was a soggy undercooked mess drowning in sauce, and skimping on toppings.   Original crust Pizza was also undercooked and drowning in sauce with a lack of toppings, some of which they even forgot.   -PLEASE use a light hand when saucing the pizzas and don't just squirt a pile of BBQ sauce on from the bottle, it should be evenly applied with a ladle and a swirl too.    How does the pizza have time to cook when it arrives literally 15 minutes after I hang up the phone?  I'm more concerned about quality than I am about your speedy delivery.   -PLEASE take the time to thoroughly cook those pizzas!   It seems when I order a pizza with meat for my man it's loaded with meat but when I order a veggie one for myself they tend to be stingy, especially with mushrooms for some reason.   -PLEASE be generous with the veggies if I order a pizza with no cheese or meat!   Fresh Herbs mean just that, FRESH, but when they are put on the pizza before baking they shrivel up and dry out and lose all flavor.   -PLEASE Put Herbs on the Pizza once it has come out of the oven!!    One more thing, PLEASE have your phone staff go through some more training.   I'm not giving up on you NAKED, but next time I order it will have to be in person so things are done right.   Let's get those stars up!

This very well could be Pita Heaven but instead it was Dolma Hell! They were canned and dreadful. That is all.  1 star based solely on the Dolma.

Congratulations!  You had the absolute best vegan sandwich in town and then you went and ruined it by changing the type of vegan cheese you use.   Why? Because your chef thinks it's better?  Last time I checked the chef wasn't the one supporting your business, and he's probably not vegan anyway.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  I have nothing against Daiya , but it does not work on "You're so keen" AT ALL.   In fact, "You're so mean" for not listening to your customers requests.  Please go back to using Follow Your Heart. So I can go back to following mine and continue dining with you.

His technique is as flawless as his smile and he's a blowdrying magician. Trust me, you will be amazed.  And as if Chad wasn't fabulous enough, they also have the most comfortable shampoo bowls you've ever laid in and they carry UNITE hair care products which make your hair smell amazing and are cruelty free.
