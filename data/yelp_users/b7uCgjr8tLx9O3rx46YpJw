Not open on Sunday..how about posting your hours on Yelp, that would be a big help!  I also wish they had a smaller size, I can't seem to even finish a small.

Just as we walked in we knew it would be great!  The scent of homey broth, cilantro and lemongrass tickled our olfactory glands into hyperdrive!  We had an array of condiments on the table to choose from but the spicy chile sauce was the best, not overly hot but pungent and satisfying.  The pineapple biba was ridiculous!  The tapioca was still warm, the pineapple icy and frothy and it was just the tastiest ever!!!! I generally dont go for boba.  Most have gelatinous balls of goo that are chewy and gross.  These were soft and perfect.  Our Pho was fantastic!  Just the right amount of coriander, cilantro and lime.  We will definitely be coming back!!

Loved the trainers but unfortunately I had to move and they made me pay 25% of my remaining contract to get out of it.  If I were just being lazy and not going that would be one thing but I'm moving out of state and feel penalized.  Nothing personal against the gym but this contract thing is ridiculous!!!

Hungry for carnivorous creations, we decided we should check out what Meat & Potatoes had to offer our gastrointestinal system.  Since I am a follower of the Paleo way of eating, anything with Meat in the name is A-okay with me!  My friends will tell you that they automatically know and should always assume that if my carnivorous cravings are not quelled they and fellow tablemates will not be appeased with my behavior.    Sooo..here we go!  We asked for options from our foodie friend aka hotel concierge and he also suggested Meat & Potatoes.  Ok, so now that are minds and GI systems are in sync we head out into the blustery Pittsburgh evening.  Our driver told us mid-drive that he heard they turn people away all the time and reservations were definitely suggested.  Since this was a grim possibility, eeek on a Monday in downtown Pittsburgh, who would've thought.  So, we called, and low and behold a 2 hour wait for a table.  We decided to show up and no space at the bar to gussy up to either, fail.  We asked about bar options from the young hostesses, I mean, they're young, they should know what bars are good around their place of business.  They suggested a place a block away, it was closed.  Seriously?   Apparently, after checking further with my handy dandy Yelp app, I came to the conclusion that Pittsburgh is a ghost town on Monday, does no one eat on Mondays??  Is there some secret cult thing here where everyone starves on Monday nights and businesses decided to give all their much needed restaurant business to one restaurant?!  We remembered there was a bar right beyond the entrance to the illustrious M&P's so we decided to check out the show selection and bar.  Much to our fancy they had a FREE show of cabaret singers and a bar!!!  SCORE!!! or GOAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL whichever suits your desires.    We got our free tixs, a few drinks and got a front row table of a packed house and enjoyed the libations until our table opened up.  The service was great until we waited over 45 minutes for 1 plate, yes 1 plate, to come out of the kitchen.  Every table was full, but these weren't plates that anyone slaved over all day.  These meals definitely didn't take 45 minutes to prepare.  We had a hanger steak (7 slices) over german potato salad and a few brussel sprout leaves.  Honestly, I've prepared meals more indepth in less time.  The waiter noticed the concerned, I'm about to go all King Kong in here if I don't eat something soon look on my face the 14th time he passed our table.  He came over and chimed in with "Oh, we overcooked your steak so it's being redone"...ummm ok, could you maybe have told me that 30 minutes ago and 2 liters of water ago?!  Our dinner was delish when it finally arrived and $32 later we paid the check and vacated our table.    The hanger steak was tender, juicy and seasoned appropriately.  Most places tend to under season steak and the chef's had a great handle on this.  The german potato salad 'dressing' was tangy, sour, creamy and touched every inch of my palate sending RED ALERT morse code signals to my synapses.  The crispness of the brussel sprouts leaves interspersed throughout the dish were appropriate and provided not only color but another texture to round out the dish.  Presentation was clean and crisp and visually appealing on a long rectangular plate with the slices of hanger steak displayed proudly atop the creamy fingerling potatoes like Tiffany diamonds on display in a sparkly glass case.  I whole heartedly believe in my dining experience starting with a beautiful and aritistic visual display of what is about to happen gastronomically.  It's like porn but better, satiated for a lot longer!  M & P hits all of your senses with muted overall lighting with hints of beautiful dim white twinkles here and there.  The 2 tops are a little strange, cramped if you decided to hang onto your app and start on your entree.  I kept kicking my companion under the table, honestly, I wasn't doing it on purpose this time!    M & P is definitely worth a reservation, make sure you follow this simple step people or you may find yourself out in the cold bitter Pittsburgh evening without a full tummy and cold nose!

I had one of their numerous specials.  Very reasonably priced for the midwest portions that arrive piping hot to my table.  I chose one of the dishesthey are known for, biscuits and gravy.  For $3.99 I chowed down on one over easy egg and a single biscuit with scrumptious gravy.  By no means was it visually appealing but was it good!!! The bisciut was buttery and the gravy had just the perfect ratio of pepper to sausage.  The clientele was mostly of the older generation, great place to read the paper and shoot the bull with strong coffee in hand.  The waitresses were what I expected, like talking to an old friend.  I took a piece of their bread pudding home, something else they're known for.  Great place!! Wish I lived closer to this little gem, perfect place for a stop when we're out on our motorcycles!

Hostess station seemed a bit overwhelmed this morning, but we were seated within a few minutes.  The young girl that took us to our table never muttered a word or made eye contact with either of us. A tad strange for a hostess and first person of contact in an establishment.  Our server came over after a few minutes and took our drink order.   We decided on the Wet Burrito and the Chilaquiles.  The pork green chile on my Chilaquiles was so hot I couldn't enjoy it and my over easy eggs were clear around the edges.  I've never had a bad meal here, today I was a little disappointed.  Our guests had the blueberry and bacon and lemon ricotta pancakes, always delicious and favorites of everyone.  The coffee rocks!  For anyone that likes their coffee leaded, this is the coffee for you!  Even though I had only a few bites of my meal I am definitely going to continue being a regular here, the vibe is chill and the food is awesome!

I read empanadas and knew I had to try this place out.  Corn Flower is a quaint little spot with inside and outside seating.  Very clean, well lit and inviting.  A cold case holds numerous tasty morsels that come in the forms of burritos and empanadas.  We were greeted by the chef this evening with a gigantic smile, 3 frosted shot glasses and a pitcher full of beautifully creamy and smooth Horchata.  Ohhhhh, it was good!  We ordered a myriad of food so that we could share and experience all the Corn Flower has to offer.  The tamales were fresh and flavorful but the spotlight of the table was definitely the green chile enchilada.  It's not the typical shaped log of boring shredded dry meat with mounds of melted plastic cheese and lackluster sauce.  This was terrific!  It was slightly spicy, moist, fork tender...we will definitely be back for more of that dish! The chips and salsa were pretty typical, a bit more crunchy and 'corny' than most.  The sweet empanadas were a highlight as well, a great ending to our meal.  We ordered the pineapple with French vanilla sauce, Nutella and lemon.  The pineapple one was my favorite, with the lemon a very close second.  No disrespect to the Nutella but it lacked a but of zip..maybe adding a little chile would liven it up!   We bought the $10 for $15 deal, even with that our meal was relatively inexpensive, $32 total for 3 adults.  The soups sounded amazing, that is definitely on my to order list next go round.  I believe it was the owner, or manager that came and talked with us, very friendly and asked if we 'Yelped' very often.  Of course we do!  Good job Corn Flower, we will be back to try out some more of your tasty offerings, you did not disappoint!,,

YUMMY!  We had the filet and chicken tepanyaki, it was outstanding!  Our server was very attentive, I appreciate that.  We started out with onion shoyu soup, very tasty.  I always have this vision of dirty dishwater when I think of Asian soups, this was far from it.  Simple flavors but delicious and warming.  Our chef was gracious enough to allow me to take photos while he prepared our meal, it was a show for sure!  The veggies were tender and grilled to perfection.  The filet was tender, flavorful and prepared just how we asked.  The chicken had a glazed exterior and juicy interior, just how it should be.  We chose the fried lobster Cali roll.  I am not a fan of sushi but I would've consumed the entire plate had I not been sitting next to my boyfriend who is just as big a foodie as I am!  The spicy mayo and eel sauce complimented each other drizzled over the succulent lobster.  The presentation was beautiful, very important since we eat with our eyes first.  Next time I think we could share the combo filet/chicken along with the sushi, we certainly had leftovers.  The foliage inside is a little strange but it's clean, quiet and not bustling with loud teenagers or screaming little ones.  No offense I have 3 of my own but it was nice to eat in a peaceful soothing environment.  We will visit again to try out other menu items, that's a given.  Sakura is certainly worth a try!

I had the BLT burger, it was tasty!  The burgers are served alacarte, which was just fine due to the ginormous size of the burger.  It was so large that I had to ditch the bun, which was a beautiful buttery masterpiece.  The grilled onions were perfect, sweet and delicious.  The patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare but was a little to dense for my liking.  They charged me $3 for a coke, a little steep for soda.  The bill came to $14.25 with just a soda and burger, little to much for a burger and soda with no sides.  The room was a bit to dark and the music was blaring, I hurried to finish my burger.  The wait staff was very attentive and not over bearing.  The burger was great but I don't think I'll return just because of the price.  I realize it's North Scottsdale but it's a little ridiculous.

As always I checked the Yelp reviews prior to driving across town to visit this interesting take on a restaurant.  The reviews weren't stellar, just a mere 3.5 out of 5 so I threw caution to the wind and decided to make the trek with my Mom and one of her friends.  Parking is a bit atrocious, most spots are labeled with a one hour max, I'm thinking because there are a lot of businesses downtown and they all pay for parking.    Don't get me wrong, I love the sound of birdies singing and carrying on but it seems a bit odd to sit and wonder whether we will have any 'poopings' occur.  The menu looked to be rather amazing, lots of local representation from beers to ingredients.  I chose the Pork Green Chile Pizza...it sounded like a good palate pleaser with Cotija cheese, seared green chiles, braised pork shoulder and a wood fired crust.  Yah, no :( When it arrived it looked like a giant white poop of mozzarella with a smattering of shredded pork and green chiles peeping out from under their white blanket.  My Mom's beautiful citrus and shrimp salad was yummy, it had 8 huge shrimp laced through the crisp layers of salad.    We heard that Brunch is super busy so maybe the food offerings are a bit different.  I would never order that pizza again.  Also, take note that there are birds everywhere..in cages, flying around, singing, chirping.  There was a huge Macau that two women started irritating and it screeched and screeched, not what I want to hear while I'm eating.    Anywho...I may try this place again if I happen to be driving by and don't have other options available.

If anyone knows me I typically don't show face in sushi joints.  I have texture issues with anything slimy, mushy or fishy smelling near my mouth or olfactory buds.  Joann and I were craving something new and exciting..and guess what Yelp just happens to have a Hot and New category to explore!  Yelp is always my go to, embarrassingly I admit even in my hometown of Phoenix.  I lived in North Scottsdale for a couple of years and it is still foreign to me when it comes to food, which is a cross I'll bear, there I said it!    So, sushi...let's get to it.  I found Nori under the Hot and New category and wowzers we enjoyed ourselves!  It's a little hidden gem with a fabulously relaxing and quaint patio complete with bamboo stalks, water feature and breathtaking mountain views (I know, people don't know we are surrounded by mountains in the Valley).  Joann and I gussied up to the perfectly set sushi bar next to a Canadian family that was consuming mass amounts of the raw rolled stuff.  I am a connoisseur of just sitting in awe at the knife skills of these clearly talented sushi chefs.  I applaud those that can wield a sharp object like a surgeon without the anger management issues and produce artful masterpieces that I'm supposed to consume.    The GM Brett talked to us the entire time we were there.  He was delightfully engaging, even spilling the ancient Japanese secret to their green tea waffles...nope, I'm not telling you, that's for me and me alone peeps!  He told us that there were 3 locations of Nori (Desert Ridge, Hollywood and this is the newest location).  He also told us that their green tea waffles were 'Valley renowned', that people would trek near and far for these palate pleasing mind blowing desserts.    So after chitchatting for a bit are hunger pains took over and after perusing the menu, which was not overloaded with run of the mill crap, I decided on Golbi (Korean short ribs) and Joann did not disappoint with her choice of Chilean Sea Bass.  It's always a gamble at a new place to go hungry and expect to be satiated when you are done...this was definitely the case!   Presentation of our plates was spot on; from the pedestal of beautifully dark and savory forbidden rice that the Chilean Sea Bass was strutting itself on like a new pair of red soled Loubitans to my personal cast iron cauldron full of short ribs that saturated my palate with a dark and stormy sweetness that urged me to gobble them up.  Dessert...wow...Brett didn't lie.  If it were possible for me to have more kids (which are all Ginger's for those that don't know me well) I would name them Nori after the dessert experience we had.  I felt apprehensive about anything green tea flavored, I love actual green tea but gelato and waffles?!  Let's start with the delicious aroma that came wafting out of the kitchen when the batter hit the waffle iron.  Joann and I looked at each other and we knew that it was gonna satiate our inner fat girl cravings for anything sweet.  When they presented our dessert it was masterfully upgraded like Beyonce with her weave...lattice work of some sugary concoctiion under the waffle, green tea macha powder dusted around the Picasso of a waffle and for the ultimate diabetic ending, the green tea gelato on top.  It was not overly sweet but the crunch is what had us..yes, I said crunch.  Brett just stood there watching us eat it and finally fessed up to the ancient Japanese secret..again, nope, not telling' ya.   It had hints of vanilla, and the green tea was most apparent in color but subtle in flavor, it was amazing!  I won't lie, I dreamt about that damn thing for several nights..it was that good!     To top off the great conversation, service, and food was the prices.  Nori isn't some overpriced place that you can only afford at happy hour (even though that is pretty spectacular as well).  This is someplace that you can take the family and enjoy yourselves and not worry about having to send your kids to wash dishes at the end of the service.  Relaxed atmosphere, beautiful surroundings...count me in again and again (well when I'm home).  Excellent job Nori..thanks Brett for welcoming us and educating us!

AMAZING!!! We were driving to another Yelp find and saw the food truck.   We immediately flipped a 'b$tch' and parked.  The menu was short and sweet, just the way they should be.  I don't get when food establishments have a million items on their menus, how can you possibly prepare those perfectly every time?  It's not happening!! Every taco we ordered was made to perfection!    I'm on the move so I'll finish this review up in a bit..my pics tell the story of what my mouth and belly so lovingly devoured!
