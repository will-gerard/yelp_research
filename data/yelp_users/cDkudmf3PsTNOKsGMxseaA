This will make me the most unpopular man in Phoenix, but I just don't get why such a big deal is made about this place.  Is it good? Sure.  Is it worth waiting in line for? Not really.

Delicious food, but not cheap.  Still, I think we will be back.

Marty is incredibly nice. He spent time talking with my girlfriend and I and allowed us to pick fruit from his trees. Oh yeah, the beer is very good, too.

At lunch today: Kids both order chicken strips. Server offers fries or fruit instead of veggies. Kids of course say yes. $2.95 upcharge per kids meal...never disclosed by the server and not printed on the menu (kids burger comes with fries after all). Server got our fries order wrong...told us that when we asked for "S&P" (as it is described ON THE MENU) she thought we meant sweet potato. Huh? Both adult salads were filled with limp, wilted, brown lettuce. At the end of the meal the server offered to get the manager, then came back with no manager and a list of excuses. Never coming here again.
