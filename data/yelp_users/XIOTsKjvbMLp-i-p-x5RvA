Highly recommended Avanti was my choice for dinner while visiting Phoenix. Avanti is located in suburban Phoenix so it would definitely have to be a recommend. I don't know how else you would find this place.   In any case, parking is plentiful. You walk into a "mid 50-60" decor with red walls and dim lighting. Servers are dressed in suits. White table cloth, complete table setting, sexy in its own way.  Short menu (that is a plus) Short wine list (another plus) and a good selection of wines by the glass.   The food wash acceptable. The osso bucco was tasty but could have been done a tinge more. I like it when the marrow is like a gel...  Truthfully, went there for the gnocchi which was okay.there were several sauces you could choose from to lather the gnocchi. I chose a cream sauce... Sauce was too thick for my liking, which IMHO took away from the texture of the gnocchi itself.  I would go back though...atmosphere nice, servers nice...  Repeat performance do-able

Close to the airport, airport shuttle, clean, comfortable but WAIT!!! What? No free wi-fi? Ethernet Cable????  $9.95 per day for internet assess?  Here's the secret. The lounge offers free wi-fi and they have several big screen televisions for the daily news, sports, etc.  Hey- for the price and the convenience. I'd stay there again.

Yelp Challenge 365 # 177/365  Seafood at its best!!!! I would never have found this place if not for Rod U who kindly directed me to several places in the great city of Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, there were no spot prawns when we dined but chose crab and shrimp in a basket with garlic and vegetables... we were there for lunch so it was just the right amount= not to heavy and enough to satisfy our appetite. Noodle dish? Cake noodle topped with more seafood and a side dish of green beans (lots of chili pepper with it too !)  The food was excellent by taste and the service as excellent. Oh, parking was plentiful compared to other restaurants and shops in the Vegas Chinatown district.   A definite stop if you're into seafood, chinese style!

This is probably the 4th time I've rented a car from Avis at PHX. A rental car is a rental car. How can that get screwed up? Well, I picked up my car at 12:30 am or so. Went to Avis counter at Sky Harbor. 1 person on counter helping someone with directions. Another person walking around straightening furniture... Stood there in line (I was the only one in line) for at least 15 min only to be told I should go downstairs to the preferrred customers and someone can help me there. Same BS. waited, finally got my car. My mistake was I asked for directions to a hotel close by. I was given directions that took me around the city and back before reaching the hotel. (hotel is 5 minutes away from airport exit). My fault of course, should have relied on my gps. When returning the car, no attendant in site. left my car.... went to counter...they said, "oh, we can email you the receipt...." I'd pay a few dollars more next time to receive service than to pay less and get little service.. Old Saying YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR and boy did I learn

One can say an "ariline" is "an airline"...this may be true however Southwest gets my attention everytime  And here's why  1) they are people movers. They have attendants walking the checkin areas to make sure you are on time and if not, they will move you up the line so you don't miss your flight. Now then, moving you up the ladder and not intefering with other passengers? Unbelieveable. They have a separate counter to deal with the late ones.  2) 2 bags checked in free. What ariline does that these days  3) At the gate, your boarding pass is coded to board by zones. Prevents the unorderly stampede of folks trying to get a good seat on the plane  4) In flight? Attendants with humor. I've always had chuckles listening to the attendants as they annouce the comings and goings  These are just a few of their good points; solid though. Now if they upgrade their fleet, I might give them an extra star!

Yelp Challenge 365 # 173/365  This review is about the beauty, class and convenience of The Wynn. I was not a guest of the hotel but did spend quite a bit of time enjoying the beauty of this property.  You walk into a bright lobby which permits you wander into the casino which is surrounded by shops and eateries.   There are cocktail waiteresses passing you in the casinos regularly to see if they can offer you a beverage including bottled water which is readily available on their tray (Imagine toting 6-8 bottles of water on your tray! Yikes)  They have cleaners around, straightening chairs, emptying ash trays, removing used glasses and cups.   They have staffing on the floors asking if they can be of any service whatsoever....  Their valet service is by far superior and very organized compared to other casinos along the famous Las Vegas Blvd (aka the Strip)  The eateries are AMAZING.... I will review the eateries separate of this review as this review is strictly for The Wynn...   Oh, the convenience?  Across the street from the Fashion Show Mall.... Perfect!  I look forward to my next visit

Ended up dining here by default. But what a good thing. Food was excellent for brunch/lunch....with champagne or mimosas or belinis  Their portions are huge and loved the patio except no ocean view like my  favorite brunch/lunch place in Malibu. Other than the lack of ocean view- it was great. Bungalow is now on my list of favorite brunch places'

Recent upgrades evident. Restaurant and lobby area okay, rooms were clean and kept to the "Crowne Plaza" standards. Shuttle service while drivers could use some customer service lessons were okay.   Truthfully, I would give them a 4 because of the room conditions which is the main thrust at hotels right?  Well, I give them a 3 because the front desk service was horrible. Front desk clerk never smiled, which I can live without a smile sometimes BUT she did NOT HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE...   AND the manager of the hotel, sitting in the lobby talking loudly with his friends..... ok, maybe he was off duty.... he should have removed his uniform....  With all the hotel properties around the airport area: they really should do better or patrons will go elsewhere.  Would I go back there again?  Highly doubt it.

Definitely not your "typical" Vegas hotel... More like the grand vacation clubs I'd say, if I had to make a comparison.  Large rooms fit for a King (or queen), suites concept with a full furnished little kitchen. Gorgeous bathroom, great view, free valet park, close to the monorail, and let's see the list goes on.   Oh, there is no casino on the property. This place is similar to the Hilton grand Vacations complex with the difference that Signature is more central to the happenings of Las Vegas.

I travel monthly and rent cars as frequent as my travel. I should have known better and stuck to my plan of Enterprise or Hertz. But I learned one more important lesson and that lesson pertains to Hotwire  I will preface by saying I landed in PHX at midnight, by the time I get the rental center it's 12:45 am.  I reserved my car through Hotwire (this is normally how I reserve my cars) and they simply send you to whoever has the cars. I ordered a standard size car (their description: Nissan Altima, Mazda 6, etc). I end up with some silly small car because that's all they had. Okay, take it because I am tired   Return the car with 3/4 tank full. they charged me for 4 "units" as they say which equal $60.   Car was rented for 2 days, exactly 48 hours from the time I picked up the car to the time of return. They charge me for 2 days and 1 hour. Okay I can live with that hour but then comes the other tax assessments etc and they hit me up for 3 days.  In the end my bill was $160 for a 2 day rental of $45 dollars. UNBELIEVABLE.   Now then, did I complain then? No because it was again midnight and I needed to get to the shuttle.....  Be careful with Hotwire's deals and confirm the bottom line before checking out. Hey, I like Hotwire but $45 quote to $160?  what's wrong with this picture

I surrender to the Carnivore Food Gods!  Made sure I was not late for my reservation. Got there and suddenly felt under attired! Asked the valet what he thought and he said "oh! very casual...no need to worry..." And so begins my story. Decided to dine at the bar (my favorite place most of the time) rather than at a table already reserved for us. Dining at the bar in itself was a great decision.   Ambiance? outdoor fire place for the wintery days and the patio dining. Main Dining Room sexy and well laid out (for those of you from Hawaii, the dining room is similar to Morton's and how Morton's is laid out) and the bar is huge! a rectangle surrounding the bar with at least 40 seats and high tops surrounding the bar area (nice touch). Regardless of where you sit; the table is set for a perfect 5 star meal!    Mastro's house salad- iceberg lettuce and freshly chopped tomatoes with shrimp floating around the salad chased my Bone In Ribeye OMG!  The King Crab and Truffle Gnocchi was absolutely amazing which was broiled but still creamy and the hint of truffle JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT...  Cr√®me brulee for desert and it was served with a scoop of fresh tossed fruits laced in some sweet liquor and a bowl of FRESH WHIPPED CREAM.....   Oh! they did give us a basket of breads to chase our bottle of champagne  A perfectly prepared meal and the service? 6 stars! from the valet, to the hostess, to the bartender (our server) and the ladie's room attendant! Who could ask for more service!  My plan is to try the other Mastro's locations in the PHX area.... If I had to rate the PHX City Hall location to the other Mastro's in OC, CA, I'd have to give the thumb's up to PHX City Hall.  Oh! One more thing! Live entertainment; pianist and singer with perfect selection of music to fit the fare!

sunday after a long drive back to Phoenix what better than SUNDAY SUPPER at NOCA  Get the set menu....they have amuse bouche you must never pass over and their desert of course the cotton candy.  Great atmosphere....great service (never had to ask for anything!!!)... great everything...   The best part was the Groupon. I am not a PHX native and when I saw the groupon, I thought to try it..... I don't know if I would have found NOCA this go around without the groupon....

With all of the eateries in the Pheonix/Scottdale area, NOCA by far, stands up above the crowd.    It's a good thing I made reservations (Sunday night dinner) because without it, we may have ended up somewhere less desirable. I had reserved a table for 4 and at the last minute my travel partner invited his son who is a PHX resident.  Oh oh! :( they may not be able to accomodate us I say... Let me call....   NOCA: well, I don't have a table for 5 unless you want to wait about 40 minutes or so.... come in anyway...let me see what can be done....  Well, leave it to NOCA who let us squeeze the 5th person to our table; a little tight but hey! sacrifce for a good meal I'd say.  The amuse bouche of the day is always a welcomed surprise. We got strawberries, creme fraiche and get this! Peppers! what a great combination and way to start the meal.  We had an assortment of main courses. This time, we decided against the pre fixe 4 course and had:   Wild King Salmon, seasoned and grilled to perfection sitting on a bed of polenta.  baby veggies colored the plate.  Steak: perfectly grilled and seasoned with fingerling potato  Veal Chop: MY FAVORITE for the night; also grilled to perfection with some mustard greens.  Yes, the cotton candy... but we tried their pistacio icecream and crackers.   They had a guest bartender who could mix anything you could imagine; even if it wasn't on their cocktail menu. Got to hand it to NOCA for such innovation.  They were crowed but accomodated us with great service and great food! What more could we possibly ask for?

Looking for comfort food.... Away from home.....  Where to go? Well. First, check out yelp reviews in the area, and you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you will find. I'm trying to find a place to eat outside of the infamous LV strip and I see Mike O's review which solved my quandry.  Located on Decatur, tucked away in the many warehouse and strip mall type buildings is Mr. Mama's. Simple menu, simple interior, open kitchen, friendly service, most times a wait for your table, good food! Good prices! And great and friendly Mr. Mama!    Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal! and the tuna melt! Whole chunks (not flakes) of albacore... Choice of cheese and a choice of soup or salad, and the clam chowder ? chowder flavored with oregano... Filled our table and tummies!  Yelp deal?  Get your deal before you go!

Pavle; he's done it again. Food and service was great. Took my travel partner and she loved it! Thanks Phoenix for the great recommend!  The only thing was by the time I got there; they had run out of a couple entrees and one of their salads. I had a salad with a very light vinegarette dressing and the duck. Absolutely delicous

Actually wanted to get to Talking Sticks. Parked on the opposite side and ended up at Casino Arizona. Tried their buffet.... meh! Talking Sticks Buffet is better. BUT the casino:  Clean, lots of machines, quite a few blackjack tables and a poker section.   Sat on the bar playing those bar machines.....now, soon after I commented about how "mindless" this game is, the machine took on a life of its own and gave me these free spins I guess is what it's called. Just kept going and going and when it finally stopped it gave me 6x more money than what my original ante was. So, was I happy? Of course, I had fun watching the mindless machine take control of my life and I had a couple beers with my road warrior partners.

Yelp Challenge 365 # 175/365  there are several Hash A Go Go's and as a matter of convenience, I tried the one at M Casino. By the way, it's just as easy to get to M's Hash A Go Go than to stress with the traffic; park or valet your car, then walk to the restaurant....   Mihcael C is correct on the size. I don't know if any ONE person can finish the entire entree......  Rod U is correct that it may appear to look like / act like a "chain" restaurant and in a way, it is....  Here's my take: food was good. The portions were a little too large (very large for my appetite), service was excellent and there was no wait for seating (at least when I was there). As Rod says, you can't go wrong with the price. Averaging $15 per entree and enough to feed 2 or 3 people, really can't complain.  I had the Chicken Pot Pie. By taste, it was a "chicken pot pie". By design, it was a "work of art" you may just want to look at.  My friend had the chicken and waffles. It was okay= like southern fried chicken and maple syrup I guess...  I think I would go back if, and only IF, I was in a large group knowing we could have several entrees and share it for tasing purposes....  One last thing! They have the best bloody marys by taste and price south of the Strip.

Yelp Challenge 365 # 174/365  On the reviews of Dave F, Michael C, Chau V and last but not least Kevin P, I decided to give this place a try. Let me preface my review by saying I am not much of a buffet person... okay, call me a buffet snob and based on my being a buffet snob, I am compelled to write a review of what I found to be  1) a new concept of buffet. Why? because each course is served in its individual dishes; portioned just right for the tasting  2) a beautiful place in a sassy hotel and casino  3) easy to get to meaning you don't have to search for it. The 2nd floor is designed such that you can simply follow the signs and you will find it.  4) reasonable in cost; the dinner buffet is $35  5) a great place to taste wines you can pair with your selections of food. You would have to purhcase a wine card for $25. Take the card to the wine chill, select your variety of wine with a 1 ounce minimum.... and you're good to go. You will be able to pair your food with the wine  And the list goes on. For the most part, if I had to do a buffet in Las Vegas, I would definitely go back to the Wicked Spoon.  By the way, my favorite course was the lobster mac n cheese, veal sliders, followed by their fresh seafood bar and then.... deserts!

Yelp Challenge 365 # 178/365  I can't believe there is only 1 other review of Hawaiian's Las Vegas location. Do I have the wrong address?????   Well, and for not much longer, you would arrive and depart out of Terminal 2 at McCarran International Airport. To a large degree Terminal 2 is a good thing because Hawaiian is one of a few airlines who fly out of Terminal 2 so foot traffic is less, security checkpoints are easier and shuttle bus service is available as well.   IF you are flying the pineapple express which leaves Las Vegas at 1:55 am the downside is the terminal and counter does NOT open until 11:30 pm so if you're at the airport before then- you jus have to sit and wait. Also, the vendors up at gate are closed.   This may not be an issue once the relocate to the new terminal

My roots have ramen (or saimin) listed as my Number 1 comfort food. On cold wintry days, on days when you're not feeling well, on days when your night turned into day, on simply any day! I can enjoy a great bowl of ramen.  So here is my story. Enjoying Las Vegas waiting for the imfamous Super Bowl Sunday, I somehow forgot that word "rest" or "sleep"... and my night turned into day.... Not wanting to wait in line for any restaurant in the casino, I get in my car and head OUT....    Onto Spring Mountain Blvd I head into the Las Vegas Chinatown.  HUGE GIGANTIC sign! RAMEN SORA  RED AND BLUE NEON SIGN  "open"  open OPEN.  All I want is a regular bowl of ramen please, miso broth, extra nori, no egg, green onions please.... OH WAIT. and I'd like a Kirin please!  Oh! A small order of gyoza (small order = 6 pieces)  Broth tasty! HOT! Steamy Hot! The way all ramen bowls should be served. And the noodles? OMG... if there is such a thing as al dente chewy! (exactly as I like it) is what I got.    Of all the ramen shops on Spring Mountain  Blvd.? This is a definite must try.   Note: depending on the time and day you try to dine - you might have a wait period... I assume that because of the sign in sheet as well as the chairs in the waiting area....

Thank you Yelp for directing me to Cuttlefish!  1) Sunday bar pricing 50% off from 3-7 pm 2) location perfect in a shopping mall; lots of parking 3) HUGE restaurant; cute d√©cor (moped seats at the fresh seafood bar) 4) nice wine selection and craft cocktails to perfection 5) friendly waiters, waitresses, bartenders 6) family owned, not part of any chain (but owner has at least 3 other restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale vicinity) 7) great food  We had to stop at appetizers!  Oysters on a half shell (3 from CA and 3 from NY- forgot the names) were FRESH FRESH FRESH  served with horseradish, cocktail sauce and some sweet chili sauce. I kept it simple with the horseradish...   Salmon Board- smoked in house to a nice medium perfection; a dill marscapone spread for layering and pickled red onion to top it DELICIOUS  Blackened Shrimp Bruschetta sitting on some sort of chickpea spread... DELICIOUS  Blackened Shrimp Wedge Salad with a aioli dressing  DELICIOUS  Now- up to this point with the 4 appetizers, our bill was $27 UNBELIEVABLE  Craft cocktail on happy hour $6  Bottle of Meiomi Pinot Noir $49  (I thought it was a bit pricey as I know what I can buy it for BUT worth every dollar) as this wine complimented our appetizers with PERFECTION  I will return to this restaurant; I want to try their cioppino which I understand is GREAT.. See you next time Cuttlefish!
