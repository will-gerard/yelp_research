I'm out $200, had Dino's come out to my house 3 different times and my dishwasher still does not work. Not good customer service and would not use them again!

This Culver's is always clean and the staff is very friendly & attentive. The custard is to die for, you won't be disappointed! My favorites flavors of the day are the Bonfire Smores, Mint Explosion, Salted Carmel Banana Nut and Double Marshmallow Oreo. Now I'm hungry!
