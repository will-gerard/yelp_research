Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!

Just left this place after ordering sushi and waiting 1hr20min and left hungry. Food never came with Slow Hand Jack at the sushi bar...tho orders put in after ours were filled. We were given a table meant for 2 and squeezed our threesome in. And to top it off, we were still charged full price for our drinks and soup. LAME! Hana's on 7th Ave is the place to be! Take heed!!!

Went here today on the fly after engine light came on while in my way to work.. They did a quick diagnostic and quoted the damage. I got my mechanic friend on the phone who agreed "this guy knows what he's talking about, and that is a good price. Do it!" I decided to rub elbows with the small crew, asking questions and observing the actual labor after they  put my car in the garage. I arrived at work within two hours having seen what was done, exactly like they explained, for a good price. I even felt like I found my neighborhood shop, with a couple if friends behind the wrench. Jesus is "good people!"

VEGAN PIZZA SUCCESS! Absolutely stoked on the availability of alternative options. I'm writing this review on behalf of my vegan husband...we were guests at a catered wedding next door. My husband couldn't eat the meat and cheese loaded dinner served, so we slipped out and walked the block looking for an alternative. A sign in the window offering Vegan choices caught our eye. Placed an order, returned to the shindig and came back a few minutes later to grab the order. He scarfed some in the parking lot to tie him over, and was anxious to leave after the event to really dig in. He's eaten many-a-vegan pies, and concluded that it was the most flavorful version he's had yet! He's a great cook himself, and knows what he's talking about...keep up the good work. Maybe offer more selections, because you're sitting on a gold mine since you pull it off so well! I would have given 5 stars, but I think the atmosphere could be spruced up a bit. Some paint and disinfectant can go a long way.

Love this place!! Best bowl of Pho in the city, if you ask me. The service is always quick and price is a great value. The interior is a little institutional in nature, for a churn and burn pace, but delicious food, quick service and a huge menu give it the edge that the ambiance lacks. When food is stellar, a hole in the wall spot can slide on the less important details.

I've eaten at Braggs about a dozen times, have always been greeted with an enthusiastic smile and the feeling of hanging with friends. My hands down favorite is their French Toast...so fresh and delicious, every time. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but love having the options when dining with friends and family who are. The small space is quite cozy-a couple of times I've even joined a table of strangers just because they were so busy with limited seating. Met some cool people that way-they seem to attract interesting, open minded types, probably because they are that way, themselves. Eat whatever strikes your fancy-there really are no bad choices. Every plate is a winner! Go-and be a winner too!
