I have been to Cindy's about a dozen times now after a friend invited me to meet her for Sunday breakfast there. It's worth the 12 mile drive for me. I can always expect good hot decent food with a reasonable price tag.   This is not a chain, so it's difficult for the Mom & Pop places to compete with the huge discounted food orders from Sysco, so I can appreciate the quality of food they serve, what they have on special and the love shared making the delicious cinnamon buns.  While the place is quirky in terms of decor, the backs of the chairs (where most people grab) are clean. This is a huge issue to me, and tells me how often somebody takes time to scrub down the tables and chairs. (The Gilbert IHOP failed recently in this rating.)  I did not know who "Cindy" (the owner) was until my 3rd of 4th visit, but I see her now every time we have gone in, to check on the order, introduce herself to us, and get our feedback. This is good business for the owner to know all aspects of their service.   I would recommend Cindy's for food, service and price!   (The only reason this did not get five stars, is that I have been to 5 star restaurants all over the country. As such, the 5 stars are saved for those only.)

I had to go inside the Chandler Mall to get some candy for my trip to the East Coast, where one lady I am going to see told me she loves See's Candy. I remember when we used to get this stuff for around $5 per pound...now, $33 for a 2 pound box!  It's still worth it! And the friendly staff inside the store is willing to offer a taste test!.  I hope all those people in line behind me were not just there for the free sample, but actually bought some chocolate!

I enjoyed the massage, and tranquil environment. While I have been to much more upscale salons, the care I received here was still very good.    Not only that, they run specials, so get on their e-mail list or sign up for the monthly membership. It is an investment in yourself!

If you like custom salads (you get to pick what goes on it) then this place is for you! The salads seem fresh, and other ingredients are plenty. The soups are pretty good, hot, and there are plenty of choices, so I like to mix and create my own.  Some comfort food pastas are ready to go, and the standard baked potato can be doctored to however you like it, including with bacon (the magic ingredient) chives, and more. Then add the muffins (blueberry, corn, chocolate, more) plus bread and pizza squares, if you leave hungry, it's your own fault! Finally, the ice cream or yogurt bar is just the final topping to having a sweet treat.

Too many people associated with business gathering places have a WIIFM attitude, but that is not the case at Gangplank. They openly share workspace, bandwidth, and collaborative information.    In addition, if it's not a school backpack-supplies drive they are having, then it's Toys for Tots or a canned food drive, so they are always giving back to the community.    Good energy, good people, good attitudes and great innovations.  What a collaboration and a model for many others to copy!

The $3.17 lemon bar was pricey for what I got! It was okay...not anything special, especially since there were larger treats that were only $2.00 and $2.50.     Okay, I agree with supporting the local economy, local farmers and all that encompasses it, but does that mean it should cost MORE when stuff doesn't have to be shipped in?!  The kitchyness of this place is kewl, but the prices are over the top and from what I saw, there is no chef working the kitchen.   One lady from the back kitchen asked for my newspaper so she could spread it out and clean up a mess on the floor? What was that about?!   Let's cheer this experiment on, but they would more likely be better supported if their prices were reduced by 20-25%.  "Organic" should be competitive too!  This reminds me of a little country ma & pop grocery struggling to keep make it....without the personality.

I have been buying from TJ Maxx for years, but mostly in Scottsdale. The crew at this store could use some training on customer interaction. I can appreciate friendly service, so when they ask "did you find everything you were looking for?" That's when I start the interaction.  They don't ask because they really care, they just have to. When I asked the manager for something, it was too much trouble for her to do her job, and she just said to the new clerk, "you can take care of this, I am going on break."  This manager has no business with customer service. (Is anybody paying attention to this?)
