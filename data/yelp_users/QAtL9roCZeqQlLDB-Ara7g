People bring in their stupid (non service) dogs all the time. They don't seem to give a crap about anyone else. I saw this guy with his Doberman just sitting there. A family of 4 with their infant child came in and sat at the table next to him and he didn't even try to move the dog. The lady had to step OVER the dog with child in hand. Upon asking the staff about policy they said they didn't care that the dog was there. Law definitely needs to change to certify service dogs. It's disrespectful to those who actually need them. In the meantime, avoid this store, unless you are a dog nutter.

People bring in their stupid dogs all the time. They don't seem to give a crap about anyone else. Morons. When speaking to the staff, they don't seem to care. I saw a lady with an infant step over the dog. So she can sit. The owner of the dog didn't look the least bit concerned.

A place that discourages bringing children in, but welcomes dogs?! I guess there are humans that are dumber than dogs.

I feel bad as I am sure the owners are just trying to make a buck, but the food has really went downhill. I think this will be my last visit here as it is overpriced for what you get.

Great location and selection. Libraries are the best thing our taxes actually go to. The security guard here is awesome and is quick to tell idiots at the library to get off their phone or to stop talking.

Waste of money and time. Their products are way overpriced for the quality and they still charge shipping no matter how much you spend. Calling customer service was a nightmare as I was on hold for 45 min. This is my first and last time I ever order anything from this company.  Sticking to Amazon from here on out.

Went through the car wash and asked the guy to take care of a one detail (behind the rearview glass) and he declined to do so. Note that I was also standing there asking him with a "tip" in hand.   I can now see why this place has a plethora or 1 or 2 stars.

Had the machaca plate. Excellent. My date had the Mexican pizza and loved it. The chips come out warm and the customer service is very attentive. The live music is perfect volume to where you can still talk.   Props to the staff and the manager for creating such a good atmosphere.

Received a note that my package as at this location. I Stood in line for 15 min to pick up my package only to find out that I had to walk next door to pick up my package at the access point. I go next door and they told me the package is on the truck and won't be there till after 4pm. In all I wasted over 30 min plus drive time.   Only redeeming quality was that the customer service at the access point was very nice and helpful in every way they could be.

Perfect example of why this countries judicial system is a joke. These lawyers are a fine example of corruption as they make their money off of honest home owners and crooked HOA's. I suggest an honest lawyer look into their records and sue them.

Some stuff is cheaper. Other stuff is more expensive. I do like the deals at the deli. They have really good turkey and roast beef. They also give a 10% discount on cardinals home game day if you are wearing a jersey. Love that they support the local team. Go cardinals!

Upon the completion of my invisilign I was more then happy with my results. I highly recommend him for any dental work that you m

Excellent customer service. Was even able to get next day service. Preferred method of payment is cash/debit as they charge a credit card fee. However, they aim to keep their prices low so I am okay with that.  They also do alterations and all kinds of other good stuff!

Just wanted 2 dozen bagels. Usually they have the grab and go. They told me to wait off to the side while they prepare the boxes. While waiting, I noticed they helped the 3 people behind me before I finally said something and received my order. Service was good, just note that it may take you some extra time.

Whole foods = whole paycheck. Another overpriced trendy, gluten free, pesticides  free, gmo free, lactose intolerant, allergy free, dye free, organic, wanna be hipster, supermarket. If you want similar type food and a great price I recommend sprouts. Similar atmosphere, similar prices, without ripping you off.

If you are looking to do grocery shopping steer clear of this place as it is an absolute rip off. The parking lot is full of Escalades and oversized SUVs whose owners don't know how to park. Therefore, parking is limited and crowd appears to be those most would consider "entitled." Some of the items they make are good, but overall the place is way way overpriced.

Kc and his crew were awesome. They were on time and did a great job. I had them move a huge fridge and they did so with not a single scratch. They wrapped it with plastic and securely placed it in against the wall truck so it did not slide around. I will definitely be using them again in the future and will happily recommend them.

When did the library become a place where people come to hang out and chit chat? The library is supposed to be a quiet place, yet you see grown adults talking to each other with no respect for others. People also seem to have no problem chatting on their phone in the library.  I know there is a quiet area, where no cell phones are allowed, yet people STILL don't understand. If you can't read the QUIET signs GTFO and go to Starbucks or something!

I had called lowes to confirm a service they provide, but upon arrival they told me they couldn't help me. If you can imagine I was pretty upset as I took time out of my day and made to the trip to get they service I had called about only to find out that they wouldn't honor it. After discussion with several members of the staff and the management we were able to come to a compromise and they took care of me. I am giving this lowes 4 stars, because of the high level of customer service they provided even though I was visibly upset. They were patient and understanding and worked with me to resolve the problem. I will continue to give lowes my business as I appreciate them for taking the time to understand the situation and come up with a solution.

This place gets worse and worse. I came into put a catering order in. I told them at the store if they could change my pick up time from 2 to 1:30. I also waited for 10 min (they even saw me standing there) while someone actually said, "is there something else I can help you with" so I could change the time of the pick up. I even called a few hours later to confirm and they said no problem.  Arrived at 1:35 and they didn't change the pickup time as asked and they had not even started working on my order. This place is the worst. As someone who uses catering several times a week I will be sure to spread the word NOT to use them.  In the end I had to ASK if they would take care of the mistake and they said, I can call and they if I want to come back they will.  Just terrible!

Hands down the worst airline in the world. I feel bad for their employees, as this airline is terrible from start to finish. Their website is awful, planes are awful, and price for flights are awful. Charging a premium for 80% of their seat is an absolute joke. I wish American would move out of AZ and bring in another carrier.

I had the Diablo burger and it was okay. The size of the burger was decent and it the presentation was good. The reason I give it 2 stars is because the cost for what you get is not even close to worth it. The burgers are way overpriced and it doesn't even come with a side. The layout is odd as well. You order at the stand and then they bring the food to you. You get your own drinks and refills. I did tip after, but wasn't sure what I should be tipping for. If I go back it will just be for drinks.
