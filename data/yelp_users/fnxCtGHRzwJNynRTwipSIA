Wow!  After years of down economy, the Golden Nugget has decided to start a $5 fee for it's guests to help pay it's share of the Fremont Street Experience show.  Citing what many of the Strip properties get away with, they justify the fee to it's guests.  Without any question, the GN is the nicest property Downtown, and thus the issue.  It's Downtown guys, not the strip....The Fremont Expereince has probably saved many of the properties by getting people to come take in the free show.  What percentage of those guests park, see the show and then immediately leave?  Probably not too many.  Most will drink, shop, oh and maybe gamble while there, dontcha think?  Let me give you my two cents: You feel you need to be the first to put in a fee?  Think the others will follow?  Do yourself a favor if you are not bringing in enough revenue, just build it into your room rates, not as an additional fee.  Which will be better received?  Hellllloooo?  Duh.  Start with the fee?  You just lost a fan and a guest, out of principle I will never stay, shop, eat or gamble in your house.  Why bother?  Lots of other casinos in the area that are less stuffy, a little more roomy,  and are more affordable in the drinks area.  Whoever thought of this one should be canned.  Be smarter.

Not bad.  Living in LA and having this place suggested for dinner, I thought 'meh', but it was pretty good.  Very good service, an old building but clean - food was excellent, with homemade tortillas as a big plus!  Nice to get away from the casinos, thanks Yelpers for the suggestion.

Made a reservation and ate as a group of five on Tuesday night.  Had originally gone over to Japonais next door but their dining room was closed, we chose not to eat in the lounge.    Upon being seated, we were immediately addressed and offered water.  That came quickly but after that it clllllll sloooooowed dowwwwnn.  Don't come here if you are in a rush.  Server came back after a while to see if we were ready, it had been a fair amount of time.  Upon ordering it took even longer.  About 40 minutes.  The waiter never came back after being served to see how things were.....We all were done for a bit before our table was cleared.  If this was Outback I would have no issue, but for the prices they charge, I would expect much much better.  I will give the fact with the Rodeo in town they were busy, but they had all day to prepare and make are they had enough wait help and they failed.  The steaks were $55+, you expect to be served properly and this place did not do it.

Great local breakfast restaurant. Fantastic service, selection and prices.  Anything from basic steak and eggs to a selection of benedicts to loco moco.  All filling and oh so good.  Next time you are visiting Vegas, take a little drive and get out of the overpriced resort restaurants.

Vistied for the second time and was not disappointed.  It's a solid 4* restaurant.  It's right next to the new Mob Bar - just down the street from the pretty cool Mob Museum.  Started off with a chopped salad, large enough for two to share with a tangy vinaigrette that drenched the salad.  Take it easy on the sourdough or you'll be sorry by being full.  I had their special, which was a surf (two jumbo shrimp) and turf (flat iron steak) - both very tasty and well worth the price.  Two friends had the ribeye and it was cooked to perfection, pretty good sized and very tasty.  Overall a cool experience, nice to get away and out of the same ol, same ol in the casinos.

Had dinner last night here. Was very disappointed that our 745pm rez became 820pm. Surprised that a place that has been around for a few years can get so backed up.   It was cold last night and there really isn't an area inside to wait without getting in the way.   A member of our group spoke to the manager about the delay and he enemies up comping us dessert. Nice touch.   The food here is excellent. Good sizes portions for the costs. There is a vegetarian limited menu available. Beware the bread. So good.   Other than the delay, it all was pretty good.

Came here after the Kings game and were disappointed.  Upon being quickly seated we waited.   And waited and then waited, waited some more and after listening to four songs, I sarcastically asking the hostess that seated us is if there was wait service or whether something had changed.    She didn't apologize, just questioned that no one had come to even drop off water and went towards the back muttering.   Two songs later, we admitted defeat and just left.   This was at 11pm. The place was barely 1/3 full. Could it of been that we were Asian and none of the staff was?  At a hotel that caters to Hawaii?  We didn't get a chance to be asses since we never were approached with any type of service other than being seated.   I personally have eaten here 25+ times before with no issues like this. It'll be a while before I think about going back. There is nothing that special about the food here, then there's the service.   Meh.

Had high hopes in dining here last night and was overall, disappointed.  Making the rez on Open Table and getting in was not problem.    I ordered a pizza and was served a good looking, luke warm at best, limp one.  I showed the server it's lack of warmth and it's lack of crispiness - he apologied and took it away, only to bring the same pizza back it's now too-hot-to-touch plate.  They did not redo it, but warmed it, making it more limp.  Tried to eat a few pieces with knife and fork.  Not too bueno.

Had the pleasure/mispleasure of eating here a few weeks ago.  The good: The rib eye - sous vide prepared, excellent but  pricey at $49 The view - the fountain show is spectacular  The not so good: The service:  For the pricing of the food, the service is meh at best.  I expect better, this ain't a coffee shop, we shouldn't have to ask for  refills of soda or water.  The appitizers....not served at the same time - spread out over 10 minutes, and althogh the King Crab tempura was tasty, they drown it in sauce so if not eaten immediately, it becomes a soggy dough piece of crab.  The Kobe beef - BEWARE - they told us that they had Kobe beef as a special that night, in two, five or ten ounce portions.  They don't mention the prices and beware it's in the $35-40 range per ounce.  It's heavenly but way too expensive.  They have a Kobe-like flat iron steak for $42 on their everyday menu so it gives the impression the special Kobe will be prices in the same range - NOT.    Lastly, check the bill carefully.  They will offer to room charge it, but be sure to take a look - in error on our bill was three orders of some lobster roll that no on ordered - plus the surprise of the outrageous Kobe - even the waitress and the manager did not know agree on the price per ounce ($35-$42).    Beware!

Had the pleasure of dinner here the other night.  Adam was our server and he was the best.  From explaining how it works for the three newcomers, to keeping the plates rotating, and a fun banter with each of us.  Prefer your lamp chops on the rarer side, just let him know and he'll make it happen  The sixty item plus salad bar is something to see.  Hearts of palms, fantastic smoked salmon, a wonderful onion and cilantro salsa, it's all fab.  Don't miss the lobster bisque and the best bacon bits every in a restaurant.  Now, to discuss the meats....parmasian chicken, bacon wrapped pork, bacon wrapped filet, their special sirloin, lamb chops, rack of lamb, beef ribs, pork ribs, flank steak - bring it all on!  If you can stand a heavy lunch, the price is better and basically the same service as dinner.   Love meat?  This is the place.

Frozen fury 15.   Two games this year since last year was lost to the lockout. Friday night was against the Rangers and Saturday was against the Avs.   Great time!  About 11,500 fans. 99% Kings fans I may add. Nice to see them play somewhere smaller than Staples Center.   Unlike preseason NFL or MLB, these guys want to win the game, with the regulars in, all game. The intensity level is of a regular season game.   If you are a fan if the Kings. Check this event out. Stay at the MGM to get the full experience. Celeb poker tourney too.

Went to the counter here at the cafe for the first time in years and realized how it was missed.  The wait staff were energetic, pleasant and actually seemed to be happy to be there.  It's a greasy spoon diner - had the burger and it was excellent - with a ton of fries for $5.  Deal.  It's been there at Binions for 2,000 years - give it a try - you'll have a good time!

Picked up my Uncle and got him checked in.  Lugged his stuff up to his room and then made arrangements to meet downstairs after he unpacked and relaxed a bit.  Went to the Long Bar, only a few patrons on the bar.  Contemplated whether I would play a little video poker when I was approached by the bartender Antwon - I simply asked for a glass of water to start.  He asked if I were staying at the D or planning on playing.  I replied that I was not staying, and not sure if I was going to play.  He informed me in a curt tone that since I was not a guest nor was I playing that he could not serve me a glass of water.  He then just walked away.  I was shocked to say the least.  I was in a newer tee shirt and shorts, I did not smell, but felt I was treated like a vagrant.  I did not ask for a free beer, or liquor - simply a glass of water and was treated like shit.  I come to Vegas on a regular basis and am usually downtown.  I thought the D had done a fabulous job on the rooms, casino and atmosphere of the facilities, but I guess I had it wrong.    I will NEVER set foot in this property again, not to play a penny or to eat.  I will be sure to let my friends know how i was treated.

DDD  Had another great meal at Bachi Burger.  Eight of us went last Sunday night.  Was not too busy and got seated within a few minutes.  Started with both the Duck and Pork Belly buns (divine) and the homemade Japanese pickles, six varieties and always great.  Our party had a variety of the burgers, and everyone enjoyed.  If you really want a well constructed, delicious burger, this is the place!  Enjoy!!

Meh.   This hotel was acquired and redone a few years ago. The rooms are pretty good sized with many amenities and a surprisingly good bed. Central air.   I personally will NEVER stay here again for two reasons. $11 valet on the weekends/ $7 during the week. No big deal you say?  Name me another hotel that charges for parking in this town. There ain't.  You can get one night fee waived if you provide a receipt from Triple George Grill across the street.  The self parking is across the street in the smelliest, dark and dirty structure. Narrow spaces and smells like pee.   Second thing is the $19.95 resort fee. C'mon, this ain't the Mirage. The wireless works when it wants. Two 12 oz bottles of water?  Please.   It's location is close to the hip container area just up the street. The Mob Museum is also nearby.   Don't bid on a 3.5* on Hotwire. You'll get this property.

Don't get the other negative reviews. Found my three-night stay was great. The room is modern enough with free wifi, great bed and bedding.   Asked for a fridge and got one within 10 minutes. Starbucks coffee in lobby, two pools, restaurant on site,decent towels and bathroom, free parking.   Again. If I paid $200 a night, it's subpar. We got it on Priceline Express for $65 per night (taxes and fees were 20%). Spring training is going on for MLB and its Spring break.   Don't overpay and complain. Get a deal and enjoy
