I just wanted to write and say what a help Mark Summers was there. I replaced a battery on my bike, and even though it didn't show up in the computer, Mark was able to find a suitable replacement for me and provided me with free reign to the tools I needed to replace it. He even was patient and nice while I pulled up a price match, and complimented my bike. Now it starts better than it ever has. Thanks Mark!

Tried to schedule an appointment today as a new patient because I broke my hand in a motorcycle accident, and was turned down. Receptionist said they take one new patient a day and as of 6/14 they are already booked until July. What? No sense of urgency.
