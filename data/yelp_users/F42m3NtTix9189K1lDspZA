Stopped in for my post-workout bowl of Chili and pitcher of beer and was IMPRESSED! Didn't want fancy- I was in my gym clothes. If you love a dark dive with really good food and prices this place is for you... The cook was visible and very friendly as well and the bartender was cool. The ladies was acceptable. The only thing missing was a smoking patio. I'll be back!

After taking my car to another shop and being told I had to pay $500 to get my car fixed AND that it wouldn't be ready till the following day I took it to Tom Bishop for a second opinion. He told me the part I needed had been recalled and even phoned the dealership for me to confirm it and make sure they knew I was coming... My car was fixed for free that same day! In an industry where it is so easy to take advantage of people Tom Bishop proved that he is trustworthy and really took care of me. I'll be back!

I dropped off my Rx at 4:45, was told an hour. At 5:45 I was told it was delayed and they needed another hour. At 7:15 it's still not ready and I am taking it somewhere else. Meanwhile I'm in hideous pain and need my prescription and Walgreens pharmacy doesn't care at all- about my health or my time. Won't ever come back.

This place is awesome! I'm a runner and wanted to add some strength training and variety to my routine and this is definitely it. Sharla is a great instructor -when I called and told her I was a Pilates newbie she suggested a private session to start so I would know the basics before I did group classes and man she worked me out! I felt like I was in physical therapy! Now the day after I am super sore in that good way. She never made me feel dumb even though she had to explain everything to me twice ha ha.   The studio is super cute and clean and totally reminds me of San Francisco :) Cool and laid back. The pricing is totally reasonable too! I will definitely be back to try all the different classes. It really is a hidden gem!
