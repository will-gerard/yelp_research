This place is really our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far. The corn fritter appetizer is so yummy and I love their pad thai, which I usually get vegetarian with tofu. I have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else!  Wish it were closer to us, we'd go a lot more often if it was.

I would say this is the best Chinese food I've had so far in Phoenix area. Have eaten twice, though both times take out, when having dinner with friends who live close to the restaurant.   The honey walnut prawns are really tasty, and my other favorite was their eggplant. So delicious!  I wish they were not so far from where we live or I'd go back more often.

The mushroom pizza is amazing.  I also REALLY like that you can order a bottle of wine from the grocery with no corkage. Their wine prices aren't bad for bottles that way,  much better than the cost of a glass!  Just don't go on a busy night and you won't have to deal with the parking nightmare or the waiting.  Go on Monday.  It was super good!

We have used Jim and staff for several years and they do a GREAT job and always save us a lot of money.  We paid so much more in taxes using another firm in the past who did not work as hard at saving us money. They are amazing, truly, couldn't be happier.

This place surprised both my husband and I with how good the food was and how fun the experience was as a whole. It reminded me of Italian restaurants on the east coast, where I am from. The decor and vibe as well as the food really reminded me of what I might find back east.   The best part was the homemade ravioli that they told us is made fresh each day. It really was amazing, better than anything I've ever tasted. It was super thin and delicate.  I would order that again for sure. The bread with the whipped herbed butter was also very good. We enjoyed our dinner and the atmosphere also was great for an intimate conversation and having a good time. We used a restaurant.com certificate and that helped the cost a bit, as they are pricey, but I'd say it's worth it!

What a pleasant surprise this place was!  Great wine list, terrific food and a totally awesome contemporary decor. The ambiance and lighting were perfect, and the space created a very relaxed, modern vibe, which was not at all what I was expecting from the outside. It's in a strip mall in a Fry's lot and looks from the outside like an average mom and pop pizza joint, but it's totally chic and cool inside!!    My husband and I are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered. I especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub I had, it was one of the best I've ever had.   The wine flights are really great, you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes. The pours are generous, you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight.   We will definitely be going back!

This place is sneaky!!  They do not tell you that they include a 15% tip on your total for the check already. No mention of that.  Our bill was $20 and some change, so my husband left a 4 dollar tip on the tip line and paid with a credit card. So I notice on our statement that it charged the $25 something and then a few days later, ran another $5 charge. So not only do they add on 15%, but they added it on to the total of what the bill was AFTER the tip he wrote in....so we paid another 15% of the bill plus the tip he wrote in.  WHAT?   I thought, what the hell is that????  And then I scanned some other reviews and saw that someone mentioned an automatic 15% tip added on. So beware of that and don't tip!!  Your bill already has it in there.  Other than that I did enjoy the place and the Dim Sum is decent, though I have not experienced much to compare with. The decor is dark, dingy and sort of run down looking. The place is huge.  It's an adventure, and honestly, that part was fun, but the sneaky charges really left a bad taste in our mouths.

I've been coming here pretty regularly for over 6 months now and I love it. The therapists are all very good and very professional, always making me feel comfortable and relaxed. I would highly recommend this place!  My favorite therapists are Sari, Kristina and Rebecca. They're all awesome!  When I had severe neck soreness the deep tissue massages I received really helped a lot and I've tried to keep going back regularly because I feel so much better and have less pain and soreness when I go regularly.

So happy to have found this place, which is pretty close to home. I went to a different grooming shop closer but wasn't impressed. The staff at Fancy Pets are very very friendly and nice and I felt totally comfortable leaving my pet there. They did an awesome job shaving down and grooming my large dog and it was at an amazing rate. They are affordable and do not charge for extras like nail clipping, ears, etc. It's all included. I really was amazed by that. My dog is very large and other places charged me nearly double what they did, so I was truly impressed!  I will definitely come back again and again!!    The nice thing too was to see that everyone there seemed happy with their jobs and were laughing and talking, having fun. It was refreshing to see that. You can tell they really like animals and were responsive and very kind to my dogs.

I was really craving a tuna melt, hadn't had one in a long time, and we found this place recommended for that. WOW, it was awesome!  It was by far the best tuna melt I've ever had.  Great little place that is off the beaten path in an industrial area, not easy to find, but well worth the trip.  I can't stop thinking about how good that sandwich was!  It's like going to your grandma's house and having her make you a really really good sandwich using Texas toast style sourdough, buttery toasted, and fresh tuna salad. Nothing like anything I've had before at a restaurant!  Loved it that much!  We will go back soon for sure to try their breakfast and infamous coffee.

I would not go back to this place, even though it is close. It looks run down and dirty inside, both in the waiting areas and exam rooms. I did not feel very confident in the skills or assessment done by the doctor or the staff. It seemed quick and not very thorough.

We went here after my dog was bit my another one of our dogs and we were hoping to not have to go to an emergency vet...having not been established with a vet yet in the area of our new house, we called around....and Countryside was able to get us in right away after hearing about our urgent situation. Everyone from the receptionist to the vet tech to the vet (Dr Dunning) was so friendly and kind. It was a refreshing experience. Our dog needed sutures and had to be put under a short acting anesthesia.  Everyone here was exceptionally nice and genuinely concerned about our dog. They didn't rush us and spent time bonding with our pet too. It was really a surprisingly good experience, having been to many other vets in the past. I would highly recommend them.

I don't even know where to begin.... When walking in, there was this god awful moth ball-ish smell that my husband later mentioned reminded him of urinal cakes. Nice.  Well, I could get over that, I thought....it was just some really cheap, bad incense, from what I could assess. All three in our party got the dinner buffet.  The food tasted good but it was luke warm at best, sometimes even cold. The service was poor and the family was sitting around cabitzing at a nearby table, ignoring our needs at times. That was annoying. The decor was awful, dirty looking room and absolutely FILTHY stained chairs that sunk in the middle like they bought them from a yard sale 15 years ago.  Horrible.    This was by far one of the worst places I've ever been to, all in all, and will absolutely never go back.

I really wanted to like this place, as it just would be so nice to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area, and it's close to home. But I was overall very disappointed in the food. The only thing I liked, honestly, was the bread and the wine.   We had the prosciutto fresh mozzarella dish and it was greasy, bland, salty and just bad. Our main dishes were the spaghetti carbonara, and it was such an Americanized "past with alfredo sauce" version of it. Very cheesey and creamy and way overpowering smoked pancetta. It was truly awful.  And at $16 or $18 a plate, hardly worth it and far from what traditional pasta carbonara should be. I'm not sure why restaurants use a cheesy alfredo sauce for carbonara, when it should be egg used for the consistency, not gobs of cheesy sauce. Bleh!  The atmosphere, wine and bread were good, but I can get that at home. Was sorely disappointed and felt the regret of spending $80 on a totally mediocre to bad experience with the food.  I have yet to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area. The closest thing is the new Italian Restaurant by Chris Bianco. Meatballs to die for!

Great family owned business where the owner and employees truly love dogs. They are in a new facility now with a wonderful, shaded play yard and grassy area for play times. My dogs always seem happy and content whenever I pick up and the pricing is reasonable. Also have used the groomer and she's awesome too!

We come here a lot for lunch. Such reasonable prices (usually around $16 total with drinks) and delicious healthy vegetarian choices!  Love the injira bread and all the choices. We haven't tried the raw food menu much, but hope to in the future. Their falafel salad is great.

Scary place.  You are greeted by a giant stuffed bear in a glass case.   Their prices were probably good, but I couldn't fully appreciate that and shake the feeling that I was wandering around a haunted, freaky warehouse with bad vibes. Granted, their prices are good because of the fact that it's a creepy, crowded, poorly lit and barely air conditioned rickety warehouse.   Honestly, I would rather pay a few extra hundred bucks to not have to drive to that part of town or go into that place ever again. If you can withstand entering the wasteland of that area and the hauntedness of that weird warehouse, then you might find something good for a great price. But definitely sage your house and have a priest bless your new couch when it arrives.

Ok, this place is a SERIOUS dump.  And I mean DUMP.  Don't for a second think that it's a four star hotel...not even close. I think Motel 6 would have been cleaner.  But let me start from the beginning....I hemmed and hawed for nearly a week online searching for the best place to stay on our honeymoon.  Based on the 4 star status and good reviews I saw online, it sounded like the best place for a suite with a jacuzzi, which was specifically what we were looking for.  I was ready to book a room with MGM or Bellagio, but became convinced after reading good reviews that we'd get more from our money with a Celebrity Suite at Luxor, which sounded really cool and looked amazing from the pictures....so we booked the room.   We get there and immediately get accosted by time share people in the lobby, which was really tacky and obnoxious. And they made it sound like they wanted to give us comps and gifts because we were getting married, never mentioning until the very end of the whole schtick that it was a time share thing. I was pissed. Then we check in. We are on the 15th floor in the Celebrity Suite. Get into the elevator and it's my fiance and another lady. Immediately the elevator sounded and felt like it wasn't working right, really rickity and scary. No big deal, I tell myself, it has to go up on an angle. Okay.  Then as it's going toward the 15th floor we hear a big crash sound and it stops abruptly and drops down at least a floor and bounces, getting stuck. It scared the living CRAP out of us. The lady grabs my fiance and screams. We all think we're going to DIE.  The elevator is stuck and we sit there bouncing back and forth with it feeling like it's about to crash any second.  My fiance hits a button and we drop down to 7th floor and the door opens. We get the hell out of that thing fast!  We're all seeing our lives pass before us...I'm thinking we're going to die before we ever have a chance to get married.  My fiance, who is a very tough guy compared to most, said it was the scariest thing he has ever experienced in his life. He thought he would die.  So.....after that, we are ready to run from the place but decide just for curiosity sake to check out our room. We go in and WOW, what a shock. It was smaller than the pictures and description made it look and the most dramatic issues were the SMELL and the horrific stains on the carpeting, along with areas of the carpet that were pulled up. Totally disgusting. I mean seriously.....I've stayed at Motel 6 that was cleaner and nicer.  At that point we just laughed and thought we must be on a show like Punk'd or something. It must be some kind of a joke.    We went down to the front desk to tell our story to the manager.  I explain to him about the scary incident on the elevator as our number one issue....his response?  "We haven't had any other complaints".  Oh, okay, then it must be our imagination....  I tell him he needs to have someone check out that elevator as something is WRONG with it and please address it. I could tell he wasn't interested in doing that. Nice.  Then I explain my dissatisfaction with the room and all he can say is...."what would you like me to do?".  Um..........  At that point, I told him we just wanted to get the hell out of there and give our money back!  He did so without ANY attempt to fix things or give good customer service.  Unbelievable.  The attitude was almost as if he's hear this so many times he's tired of dealing with it and just immediately refunds people and gets them out.  Which is probably the case.  We quickly took a cab over to Bellagio, which is where we should have stayed in the first place, and had a wonderful time there.  It was like going from hell to heaven.

We used to come here a lot and liked it, but after a couple of so-so experiences with the food (nothing special, lots of oil, pasta drowning in too much oily sauce) we stayed away for several months. Tried it again recently and it was just as bad, if not worse. Disappointing because it's a neighborhood place and we like to support family businesses, but I think a little more effort needs to be placed on the quality of the dishes. It seems like no matter what I get it's just overly rich, too oily and bleh.   Also, the price on the dishes when you get a simple pasta with pesto adds up in a hurry. With wine and stuff, spending $100 for two?  Hardly felt worth it at all for that money we could get a much better meal elsewhere. I sincerely do hope it gets better because the people are nice and the atmosphere is great!!  And they do have a terrific wine selection. I think maybe the only way I'd go back is to try the fun looking wine bar.

I really wanted to like this place since it's right around the corner and we're huge fans of Italian food.  But our waiter had a bad attitude right from the start. He made us feel unwelcome,  like we were a nuisance to him.  I can deal with that if the food and everything else makes up for it, but honestly, it didn't.    I didn't think the pizza was very good.  Maybe it is just not fitting for how I like my pizza, so just my opinion.  If you stick to ordering pasta and appetizers it will likely be a better outcome.  The bread, wine, caprese salad and tortellini were all pretty good.   My mother-in-law asked the waiter if he could dim the lights because they were too bright for a nice dining ambiance, and he said he would. However, it didn't happen. So my mother-in-law asked the waiter again and he said he told someone. Finally, after it still didn't happen, she got up and went out to the patio to ask the owner herself if he would dim the lights...voila, it happened instantly.  It just shouldn't be that hard. I really have no idea why the waiter had such a weird attitude, but right from the start it made us uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the overall experience did not leave me feeling like going back.

Great place, totally didn't mind that it was a $40 breakfast for two (we had a mimosa, coffee and oj, which added a lot to the bill). If you dont' load up on drinks your bill won't be so bad. The food was exceptional and the atmosphere cannot be beat. So nice on a beautiful sunny day with 74 degree temps. Really gorgeous.  Go before 10 am on a Sunday or it will be totally crazy busy.  Overall a great place and we'd go back.

This place was a pleasant surprise!  We are vegetarian and found a lot of choices on the menu. The veggie spring rolls are awesome, vegetable tempura also very good. Everything we ate was exceptional, including the veggie roll sushi. I was also impressed that their house sake, on happy hour, was actually good tasting. I was used to places using cheap tasting sake. Again, another pleasant surprise. We are happy to have found this place and will be back!

Wow, this place is just not good.  Went there for lunch and first off the chips and salsa were terrible. The salsa tasted worse than pace from a grocery store jar. Then came my "taco salad".  I asked if instead of meat I could have refried beans. Okay, so my $13 "taco salad" consisted of a shell with iceburg lettuce and a ladel full of refried beans on the top. That's it. Yeah. That's it.  Oh, I did get some sour cream and guac on the side of the plate, but no tomtatoes in the salad, not even a little onion or garnish or anything. Just iceberg lettuce and refried beans poured on top. It was gross!!  And it was $13 dollars!!  Give me a break.  My husband ordered a black bean chimichanga. The beans were soggy and refried style black beans, no flavor or spice, totally boring. The food was seriously terrible and ridiculously expensive. We spent over $30 on that crappy crap of a terrible lunch and will never go back there.

The food is really nothing special.  We've been to many pizza and wine restaurants and this is one I wouldn't go back to for a few reasons. Mainly because the food was just average at best. The artichoke dip was not great, the bread was hard as a rock and the chips were stale. The pizza was just kind of blah. The service also was not so great, the waiter forgot our salad and completely spaced out ordering one of our pizzas, which actually, we were glad to see because we didn't really want it after trying the first one.  There are better places to go for sure.

The food, especially the bruchetta, is very very good. The pizza crust is perfect and the toppings fresh and yummy.  Their wine specials and happy hour drink specials are awesome too!  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because both times we went (twice in the past couple weeks) the hostesses were so ridiculously scantily clad that it was not only distracting, but rather stripper-like offensive.  It's clear that they must intentionally look for eye candy hostesses, which is fine,  but seriously, have a dress code so that their tight mini skirts aren't about to show underwear and ass cheeks and their boobs aren't falling out like Hooters down the road.  It was a bit too much.  After seeing this twice, on two different visits with two different  hostesses, I came to the conclusion that it must be part of their idea of  chic and hip, or maybe because Mill Ave has Cuties hot dog stand around the corner and Hooters down the road, so they want to show they can also have some young eye candy too to lure in the college crowd?  I don't know, but I thought it was over the top.  But hey, if you like that kinda thing, you'll really love this place!!  :-)

This place is really amazing.  I've been to a lot of vegetarian restaurants over the years and this is one of the best by far.  I just wish they were closer to Tempe where I live!  It's totally worth the drive though. We had the cucumber rolls (incredible!) and I had Pad Thai and my husband had the Kung Pao. Both were awesome.  Everything we got had amazing flavor and freshness. We had been going to Green and I have to say, this is better and worth the extra money. I didn't mind their prices because the food was really outstanding.

Man, it's hard to find good Chinese in Phoenix area.  I used to like Wongs in Tempe, but since they changed ownership it has really gone down him and is terribly greasy now.  But this place is surprisingly good!  And definitely reminds me of east coast Chinese food.  When I lived in Boston I would get scallion pancakes at a chinese place there and they were my fave from over 20 years ago!  This place reminds me of that food. It is pretty darned good. And if you haven't tried scallion pancakes before, give it a try-- really awesome!  We get delivery and pickup from here. The place is a hole in the wall with plastic tables, definitely not fancy, but truly the food is a cut above any other Chinese I've had so far in the valley.

Wow, this place is great.  I've lived here since 1997 and have been searching for good Chinese food ever since, and seriously, this little hole in the wall place is the best!  We order delivery or pick up at least once a week and are always happy with the food. The scallion pancakes are THE BEST!  You have to try them.

Wow, this place was beyond a disappointment-- it really was horrible. The kind of horrible where all you can really focus on is getting out because you KNOW it's just so bad that there is nothing they can do to rectify it if you were to complain.  It was that bad. Someone else on here commented that the chef should cook for a school cafeteria, and I think that was being too kind and generous!  We ordered a few appetizers and split an entree.  All three apps came with the same disgusting sauce which was obviously a bizarre mixture of ketchup and duck sauce. Totally gross.  They served this same sauce with the egg rolls, tempura vegetables (so terrible) and the tempura tofu, which on the menu said came with peanut sauce. Things were so bad that at one point we joked that maybe we were on candid camera, being pranked or something.    The entree was awful too, veggies were overcooked and soggy and even the darned white rice was overcooked and pasty. Unbelievable.  I thought at least I wasn't paying full price because i was using a restaurant.com certificate, but this horrific lunch still cost us $25 after taking $10 off!!  What they don't put in the fine print is that you cannot order off the lunch menu for your certificate, even though it says can only be used at lunch, you have to order off their regular more expensive dinner menu. Great.  So then they also work in an 18% gratuity charge onto your total before computing the tax. So they include the tip in the taxable amount????    Crimity!  Yes, they did.  Take my word for it, my husband and I have been to many, many Thai restaurants and this takes the prize for the absolute worst one ever.  Anywhere else would be better.  Our fave still remains Yupha's or Wild Thaiger.  We should have run the other direction when we arrived at 1pm to a totally empty place. I always try not to think that's a bad sign, but it always is....always!

Wow, this place really exceeded my expectations. Excellent, amazing, wonderful pizza!!!!  I would say it is right up there with Pizzeria Bianco, but without the wait.

This is a great place with a fun, relaxing atmosphere. We stopped in for an after dinner snack/drink and just had onion rings, sweet potato fries and drinks.  We are looking forward to going back to try their veggie burgers. For a gourmet burger kind of place, we were happy to see lots of vegetarian options as well. The root beer float was awesome too!

I thought this place was fantastic!!  Food is very fresh and tasty, not greasy at all, which made for NO indigestion afterward. That is so rare with Indian food, I usually feel weird afterward from the grease and spice. Their lunch buffet is very very good. We want to come back for dinner and try mutter paneer, my fave!

What a great job done, and an excellent deal for $119.  We did both our home and office and between both places, it was a big job, so I thought it was a super great price for the amount of carpeting it covered.   Plus, James did an amazing job of getting stains out and thoroughly cleaning the carpets. Really impressed and happy with it.  Nice thing too was no upselling, he honored the price quote given and showed up on time too. Will definitely use again!

This place is really as good as it gets.  Amazing atmosphere (if you sit at the bar you can watch all the chefs make magic), very cozy and fun, and the food is fantastic. Oh, and the wine list totally rocks.   We also really appreciate that there are lots of vegetarian options that are delicious. We had a great time sitting at the bar drinking our wine and sampling the food. Everyone who works there is very friendly and very very efficient with the service. I would say this place is on the top of my list of favorite restaurants in Arizona.

I love that their menu is changing with what's seasonally available, it's always fun to try the new items.  We enjoy going here SO much and try to go at least once a month if not weekly!!  Love love love FnB!!!

Wow, I was surprised at how much I liked this place and the veggie sandwich we had. Fresh yummy bread, very good tasting sandwich, just the right size, very fast service and CHEAP for what you get. The sandwich was enough to fill me up and it was only $4.25. You can't beat that! Much better than subway. I'm a new fan, it's across from where I work and I will be back!

So glad I found this place right by my house. Dr Capwell is very nice and it's a small practice, which I like. She is very reasonable in the charges and doesn't suggesting things that are unnecessary. She shows a lot of genuine caring for the animals and we have switched over to using her for all of our pets.

Did an okay job on basic wash but I wouldn't go back because of their extremely uncomfortable waiting area.  There are very few places to sit and it looks pretty run down. I sat outside in the heat and was very uncomfortable. If they had a nicer place to wait I'd go back.

Great place and it keeps getting better. Their coffee is totally awesome (comes from coffee cartel, how could it not be?) and the menu/food choices keep getting better and better. We love to go for breakfast and get tofu scrambles.  Their vegan desserts are really incredible too. We love this place!  So great to find a vegetarian restaurant of this quality.

Great place, food was fresh, reasonably priced and tasty!  Simple recipe for success. They gyro is amazing, the falafel and salads are good too. It appears to be a family owned "mom and pop" place and the kids were helping, which I thought was really cute. I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner since it is right around the corner from work, but so glad we did today. Will definitely be back.

I came here with high expectations after reading all the great reviews. The place itself is very clean, spacious, modern and awesome looking. The vegetarian springs rolls were very good for an appetizer. However, our entrees were extremely tasteless and bland.  And I mean extremely...shockingly so. My husband had the yellow curry and I had the pad thai. There just was no flavor in either dish.   The ingredients were fresh and had potential, but I had to ask for a side of peanut sauce to try and add some flavor....and even the peanut sauce was pretty bland. I seriously thought they forgot to finish the spicing of the dishes or something. Oh well, I would say there are much better places for Thai food, like Yupha's or Wild Thaiger!  They need to spice it up and add more flavor to their dishes and then I'll come back!

This is an amazing place, I don't get why the reviews don't reflect it. For the views and atmosphere ALONE I would give it five stars. We went for a late night dinner at the bar area in the back, but got to see all the really cool private dining areas they have with views. It felt like Vegas!  Really amazing.  We are vegetarian and not a lot on the menu as far as dinner entrees we could eat (in fact, none) but we did a la carte sides and they were really yummy. The broccolini, caesar salad, steak fries and bread were great. I really enjoyed the modern design and sleek atmosphere. When you see all the little private dining areas (reservations needed for those I'm sure) that also have super incredible views, you will be sold. I truly forgot that I was in Arizona. I felt like we were in a big city or in Vegas. Cool place.

I used to like this place years ago. But last two times we went for breakfast and the food was awful, service slow and just nothing to like about it. The skillet breakfast (I got the Cabo) was so bland and greasy and gross. Even the egg wasn't cooked right and was super crispy and greasy on sides. Super disappointed. Won't be back!

I really wanted to like this place because it's so close to home.  And honestly, it's not bad, and it probably depends on what you order.  However, I wasn't really impressed overall with the food or the prices. The atmosphere however, is really nice and relaxing. I would go for a drink at the bar (beer only, wine is too expensive).  The "bread" is crunchy flat bread and bread sticks with a smokey hummus that they bring out right away. I didn't like it, but maybe it's just my palate.  The onion rings are good, very oversized and with tasty dips.  The flat bread pizza was weak, not really anything to write home about at all. I didn't like it, honestly.  The arugula salad was good.   So it was hit or miss, but for one app, a salad and one small pizza we felt a bit cheated with a bill at nearly $60.  That's with two glasses of wine and one beer.  Next time I would drive further and go elsewhere, especially for that kind of money.

I almost didn't want to review this place because it feels like the best kept secret...no one seems to know about it and it is AMAZING!  The wine flights are awesome, the view is to die for (go at sunset) and the decor is right up our alley...super mod, contemporary design. Very chic and interesting decor. In fact, it was so incredible that I made my husband and his friend to check out the ladies room...black subway tile, super cool sinks and an incredible view. (OK, that sounded a little strange that I made my husband take his friend into the ladies room....but really, it was that interesting!).  I also ventured into the men's room just to see the decor myself.   We went at 5pm on a Friday and it was dead. We were shocked...how could such an amazing,cool place not be busy?  It's our new fave wine bar, really truly.  Try the Laetitia Pinot Noir (if they still have it).

Joy to the Pets is a great pet sitting service. We have used them a few times now and are always impressed with their reliability and how well they treat the animals. The dogs always seem content and happy when we return and our house is always as clean or cleaner than when we left!  We have used them for both overnights and visits and they are stellar.

Very prompt, reliable and friendly!  And the cars/limos are nice and clean. We bought a living social deal to try them out and used it for drop off and pick up from the airport. Couldn't ask for better communication or service, they called the day before our flight to confirm and check in on the time, etc, and were there at the airport when we landed. We would definitely use them again.

I had given up on ever finding great Chinese food in Arizona. Chous is not only the greatest in the state, but I would venture to say the best I've ever had anywhere!  Seriously!  Their beef pies are the best, every time we go (which is pretty often now) we get beef pies and some kind of eggplant dish-- either the eggplant, potato and jalapeno or eggplant in brown sauce.   Other favorites on the menu are beef friend rice, any of the pies or dumplings, and beef noodles. You can't go wrong with ANYTHING you order, even the fish is great. This place has become our new favorite, not just favorite Chinese but one of our all time favorite restaurants.

Kelsa is a pleasure to work with, very genuine and caring, and the money you spend on her services is truly an investment that will pay you back tenfold and more!  I gained a lot of insight and skills from working one on one with her on my business and personal spending. She thinks outside the box and meets you where you are judgement free, with sincerity in wanting to help you better your situation. Highly recommend her!  Like others have said, it is a LIFE CHANGER.

Food is terrible. No joke, just bad.  Beer selection is good. The only reason to come would be for the beer selection but that is just not enough. The pizza was by far the most disappointing thing I've eaten in a long while. DONT get the pizza.

Very happy to have found a restaurant in this area that I'd go back to more than once, and have it become a regular stop for lunch or dinner in our neighborhood! In fact, i'm ecstatic as there are so few good restaurants in general in south Tempe.   I really liked the tempura...light, fresh, not greasy and the miso soup and california roll was excellent. Looking forward to going back to try the ramen dishes and more of the sushi rolls.  Everyone working there was super friendly and attentive. They also have a good selection of beer, sake and wine. We will for sure be coming here again!  We had a huge lunch with a large Kirin and the bill was only $36. They also have a nice, large patio which is great because the indoor seating is small, but cozy.

This place is top notch. Great staff, wonderful caring very, always professional and thorough in their care. And all of that for such a reasonable amount. Stellar, truly amazing.  It seriously blows away EVERY other low-cost spay-neuter place I've been to and I've been to them all, trust me. I've been doing rescue for 10 years so I have been to EVERY one in the valley. This place is a major standout.

Unbelievably good, totally blew our minds.  Excellent ramen, homemade noodles and buns really make it outstanding.  Gyozo was fantastic too. So far every single dish has been totally delicious. We have been there twice in one week!!!

I am hesitant to leave this review because I really don't like to leave negative reviews. However, I can't get over how rudely I was treated and just have to speak up.  We arrived at 5:40 last night and walked up to the hostess station, no other patrons around us, and asked for a table of 2. The host, a man with a shaved head, said it would be around 20 mins. I responded and said  "Oh....we are hoping to catch Happy Hour" (which ended at 6pm). I expected he might then offer a suggestion, like "you can go sit at the bar" or "let me put your name on our list and hopefully get you a table asap".  Instead of that kind of response, or even any response at all to me,  he literally turned away, completely ignored what I just said, and started talking to another patron who had just walked up after us and asked them "Do you want to get on the list for a table?"  Errrrrr....what just happened?  I was taken aback and in shock. We were just having a conversation and now you've turned away and started ignoring me. We wanted to get on the list for a table. It was extremely odd and outrageously rude. I basically got brushed off and he went on to the person behind us who had obviously walked up after us. I looked at my husband and said "Lets get out of here" and we walked out.   My husband was super pissed and gave the guy the finger as we walked out. I realize that was a bit harsh but he was mad as a hornet that I was treated so rudely.  Of course, that got the manager's attention and suddenly he freed himself from prioritizing the other patron and ran out after my husband asking in a rather hostile tone  "What is the problem????"  My husband told him about how rude he was and why we were pissed, and his response was simply, "They were first".  No apology. No offer of a solution.   When we walked up, no one else was there. The other people obviously came in after us, I saw them walk up behind us.    My sense of what happened is that the "host"/manager determined that we were not worth his time since we were dressed very casual and disheveled after a long day, my husband tatooed in a baseball cap and shorts, me with no makeup, and that the clean cut guy in a polo shirt who came in after us with a girl in a dress were more important and worth attention and priority. We felt judged and dismissed like we were trying to get into an exclusive club that has a dress code or something.  We are foodies and we know a lot of people in the industry and my husband has worked in nice restaurants throughout the valley himself. We live in close by affluent Warner Ranch, and we spend a lot of money on food and wine. They lost a very good potential repeat customer by treating us that way. I'm still in shock that it even happened.   I really tried every which way to see it as some kind of misunderstanding because I didn't want to believe that we were intentionally treated that rudely. But I can't come up with a good reason or excuse for that behavior.   Instead of chasing us down to diffuse the obviously escalated situation, he was instead confrontational and adversarial toward us, asserting that the other couple was there first and really just being a dick. Had he approached us and said, "Hey, there must be some misunderstanding, I'm not sure what happened, what can I do to rectify it?" the whole situation could have played out differently and we would have been forgiving, because maybe he really didn't realize he was being a dick and now wants to not be a dick. But he basically added fuel to the fire and was argumentative.   The guy's attitude and responses to us felt more like a fight with a strip club bouncer and not a manager of wine bar.    As a host/manager I expect friendlier customer service and better problem solving skills, so that if a patron feels like they were just treated rudely, the situation can be positively worked out so that everyone is happy again. As a human being, I expect common courtesy. The rudeness was truly shocking. I'm sad that this person's behavior reflects poorly on this restaurant as a whole  because i'm sure there are many positive things about it as well, minus THAT guy.
