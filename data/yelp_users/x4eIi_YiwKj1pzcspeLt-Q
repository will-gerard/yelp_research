I am a parent of a student entering 6th Grade at Arizona School for the Arts. I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.  I will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?    My son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.    We were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.  And, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.    He loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.  Then the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.  The school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.  This school is really a dream.  It's an educational opportunity I would recommend to any parent.  I think my son would write a similiar recommendation!

This used to be on my very short list of "favorite" restaurants. Everything was perfect - except the Pad Thai (I am a traditionalist when it comes to Pad Thai and it's not realy Pad Thai at fate, the noodles and the sauce are wholly different).    The crab puffs were amazing, the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm.  I even enjoyed the loud music next door, the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty.,  Loved it.    I am sad to see this place die out. I have NOT visited FATE since SENS opened up - I was hoping SENS and FATE would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas, FATE moved on without Jonny and that was a huge mistake.  See my review of SENS.  That place just keeps getting better and better.  I am addicted.  We go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food.

Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.    My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!  Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!

This is a very odd, disgusting, wonderful, enchanting, engaging, and dark neighborhood bar experience.  It's a hole, and a hole I love.  I go there a lot, with my firends and family - and now my son (since the smoke is no longer inside).  The food is remarkable. I don't know how they do it, they have the BEST food - with roast beef cut right off the roast and the GREEK salad is awesome.  It's great food at a great price, with the neighborhood clientele, a juke box, darts and pool - that my son can hang out and play with us.  I am not exactly hot and I get great service - tableside even!  I think it helps if you are nice...so be nice to the people who work there, and they will be nice back to you.  Funny how that works!

I have to say that this office is amazing.  I went there for my eye exam and got my glasses at this very hip, sexy awesome place.  I had my boyfriend go there and he got these amazing glasses from Central Phoenix Eye Care and WOW, he is happy with the glasses and their service.  He wears his glasses all the time, but I don't...and they broke twice and the Central Phoenix folks found new stems and replaced them immediately - at no charge.  They were super warm, supportive and friendly. I am 100% delighted to report that I will be getting my new glasses there!

I am not sure I can say more than has already been said. I loved Dr. Heather, and when she left I was saddened beyond words. But then I met Dr. Mastores and realized there was life after Heather.  The thing is, EVERYONE here is nice! My husband and son go here as well, I converted him over soon after we started dating. It was so easy...the service and the one stop shopping.  Just stop in and say Hello and you won't want to leave.

I don't want to sound like I am repeating what everyone else said, but I agree! I had my nails done by Marie and they turned out FAB. It was my first time with the Shellac and I used it on my nails and toes and it lasted through the holiday and into January. I am going to get my nails re-done tomorrow, but my toes might last me another 2 months since it's winter and they aren't even allowed to see the light of day!  Marie is efficient and kind. My son didn't want to be away from me that morning, so she welcomed him in her tiny room and we made it work. She's so patient and wonderful with all my questions and eager to share her knowledge and her craft. I highly recommend Marie.  One note!  She only takes cash/checks, so don't leave home without them! :-)

This Jewelry Store GAVE me money back...yes, they paid me!!   In today's economy, you try and work to do everything right so you can save a little money here and there.  I took in all my old gold, my new engagement ring, and my demands for the perfect wedding band.  After a 1/2 hour, we had picked out a wedding band for my fiance with one helpful employee and I had resized and sold my old gold with the help of another employee.   Within hours they called to tell me my money was ready as was my diamond ring!  Really?  The SAME DAY?  Then, less than a week later, my fiance's ring arrived.  We picked everything up and they gave me cash and we walked out the door.  I didn't pay them a cent.    I have worked with other Jewelers and even sold other gold pieces at a party I held - but this was the BEST experience I have had with a Jeweler yet.  My ring looked BRAND new and fits perfectly, and my gold received the BEST and the most HONEST pricing EVER!  Bring everything to these folks - they are eager to assist you and offer honest, reliable service.

This is a favorite GEM of ours in the middle of north central phoenis.  We ALWAYS take the stairs down to hide out in the basement with the BEST bartender in the world - STEVE (aka Jared) we love you.   The scallops are my favorite, as are the brussel sprouts, the BEEF, and the desserts.  The vodka and soda gives you a shot of vodka in a glass with ice and you pour the soda...watch out! :-)  I DO recommend it, and don't worry about the crowds...just call ahead and reserve a table in the basement and you'll enjoy your relaxing evening.

This remains one of our favorite restaurants. We try and go late-night on Fridays and head to the basement so we can see our favorite bartender Steve.  The food is even better now that we can get the Richardsons menu!  I can't wait until the Richardsons restaurant opens up next door...and I hope there is a patio in our future.

I feel horrble to have to say this to my fellow yelpers, but working with Checker Pool and Pump Supply was a horrible experience.  The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.  First the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his "technicians."  Okay.  A couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.  He came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, "either I come in an hour or on Monday."  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.  Then he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.  When he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.  He then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.  The new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.  This particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and

Can I give these company a worse score?  Less than 2 years later, the pump I purchased is broken. My regular pool guy (who was out of town in August of 2011 when I wrote the 1st review) took the pump apart and found out that it was never grounded.  Buyer BEWARE!! I am not the only person this happened to. No apologies. No warranty. Nothing.

My mother received a Williams-Sonoma Le Creuset stock pot in the color OCEAN which is exclusive to this company.  There was a lovely display for this in the Biltmore store, so I purchased it for her in November for her birthday.  In December, my father called from Scottsdale to ask me about the color and the company that produced the Stock Pot. My mom apparently loves it a lot and wanted more pieces.  He drove to Williams and Sonoma in Scottsdale Fashion Square and it was an unproductive trip. The store staff was not familiar with the color, and didn't have anything to offer him - they told him to purchase it online.    Upon hearing this, I called the Scottsdale and the Biltmore Stores.  The Scottsdale store person had never heard of this color, but he indeed had some pieces in stock. He actually made me to go the website and give him model numbers of things I was hoping to find. It was really crazy.  I called Cindy in the Biltmore Store and she was quick to respond that she knew EXACTLY what the color was, she knew they had a floor display of the color and the pots and various other pieces (frying pans, tea kettle, etc.)  She also agreed to put a few pieces aside on hold for my Dad so he could look at them quickly and easily without any confusion.  My Dad drove down this week and found all the items he wanted to purchase super quickly and he said he did not deal with Cindy, but that the experience he had was very good.  He also loved the Biltmore mall and found the parking easy and meandered over to Macy's to get her some Estee Lauder perfume as well.  Thank you Williams-Sonoma!!!  My mother is going to have a great Christmas.  And yes, this is a spoiler, but my parents are not likely to check yelp reviews...but if you run into my Mom, keep this a secret for a couple more days!

My son and I have been seeing Dr. Simpson since about 2003...and I must say that this is the BEST relationship I have been in with a healthcare provider in years.  What a terrific OFFICE!  The people there are always kind, especially Pamela who mans that front desk with such incredible skill.  She is savvy with insurance, warm with patients, funny and so very kind!    I can cite lists and lists of reasons why you should visit this Dentist... --My son fell off the jungle gym (or something like that) at school and dislodged a tooth - and Dr. Simpson checked his tooth immediately upon arrival, explaining what had happened and giving us our options.  It was a baby tooth, but my son was pretty shaken up and we wanted to make sure it could stay in his mouth for the balance of it's short life (it did!) --My husband (then fiance) hadn't had his teeth cleaned in a while and wanted to have then cleaned and x-ray'd....only to find out he had periodontal disease!  Dr. Simpson was on it immediately and I am told he enjoyed a thorough cleaning with some relaxing gas and tunes from his iPod - reportedly the most comfortable cleaning of his life (seriously?  I think they scraped his teeth down to the roots!) --And ME!  I have pretty good teeth but Dr. Simpson reminds me of how to keep them that way, and he's saved me from a couple exposed roots and some tricky plaque deposits!  Whew!  What makes this more impressive is that we tried to LEAVE Dr. Simpson when insurance issues made it tough for us to stay...and we tried another dentist and everyone BEGGED me to let them go back to Dr. Simpson.  So..humbly and politely I rescheduled with Pamela who welcomed us with open arms...  Don't bother looking...there isn't another Dentist like this!

I am always skeptical of YELP scores that are perfect 5's.  Really?  No one has EVER complained about this vendor?  So, I waited and waited, for months, to come up with some reason to give Dr. Nemanic something less than a 5 star rating.  I can't do it.  He's truly exceptional and terribly pain relieving!  (Although I guess he could get a lower rating for being too far from my house, but really, that's not fair and he's overcome that objection by being so awesome.)  A few months ago I was in a lot of pain. I called 2 other Chiropractors near to my home and explained the pain and my severe, nearly immobilizing, discomfort.  Much to my chagrin, they mentioned that they could schedule time for me 2-3 days, even a few weeks, out in their schedule. I couldn't believe it. I was nearly crying on the phone.  That led me to YELP and to Dr. Nemanic.  What happened on the phone with him was as remarkable as what happened in the office.  "Can I see you in 45 minutes?"  he said!  Yes, in less than an hour I was experiencing less pain that I had experienced in months...and just weeks before my summer tour of Utah and Iowa and Wisconsin, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up in tears.    Dr. Nemanic not only adjusted my back and neck to ensure a predictable and continued recovery, but he offered additional advice on other areas of intrigue (my legs not pointing forward, my lower back pain, my workout efforts, etc.) and encouraged me to move forward slowly but surely into a healthier status that I was before the fateful "fall" that brought me to his doorstep in the first place.    I highly recommend this Dr. no matter where you live in the valley...drive there, enjoy the experience, and don't forget to thank me and the other YELPers who have led you to this place of blissful painlessness.

I love going to Lo-Lo's.  It's unique and clever, the food is terrific, and the wait is reasonable - standard breakfast waiting.  The whole concept of Chicken with Waffles appeals to me on so many levels. It's a great place to take visitors and family members who have never been there.  It leaves a smile on your face for the whole day!

This is a GREAT bike shop.  My son has decided he loves to bike and so we went to 3 bike shops before finding this gem.  Nice prices for an entry level biker (or a bike collector, great vitage bikes, or a serious biker might find something, but since we are new at this, well...that's all I can review).   The guy that worked there (not the owner) was sooo nice! He worked with my son on how to change gears and he hooked us up with a new seat.  After a weekend of more biking than I have done in 10 years, I am going to head back and get my son's bike fixed (he crashed), look into a bike helmut and a new bike for the hubby! :-)  I really liked this place!

I had a wonderful romantic weekend here at Camelback last weekend, and this place NEARLY has a 5 star rating in my opinion. The staff is incredible, the food is scrumptious (might I recommend that you eat at the bar and get sangria and enchiladas!?), the rooms are clean and very unique, and the parking was convenient and easy to carry in and out.    The pool was nice, but not great. That's the missing star. No fountain to swim under, and not curved enough for little sanctuaries of privacy. I might be picky, but the Kierland is one of my favorite pools - and I have been to some classy pools in Tucson for a "staycation" or two - and this was just average.  At the end of the day, it was miraculously cool (110 degree day) and we took a walk around and it was so pretty, and we sat outside and had a drink and enjoyed the patio outside the bar and the live music - such a nice vibe.    The other reviews are all accurate - even the local fued and the crowded pool!  I must say that we did NOT use the spa last weekend, but I did use it last year for a day trip with some girlfriends and it's a HUGE 5 star spa.  The pool is GREAT!

I just wrote my review for Rokerij, so it seems only right that I praise the originator of all my love and affection - Richardson's.  I love this place. When I was single, it was my SECOND date place, where I asked to be taken when I wanted to cuddle up with the perfect cutie pie.  There are booths that are like caves with pilows and relaxing sofa like seating,.  The food is out of control good - unique and very interesting - always!  They have scallops and bacon here as well....and BRUNCH is fun and tasty.  ....  I love DICK's too, but I can't do three reviews for the same owner...just trust us all - go there!

This Student Union is like no other. It is amazing and the setting is beyond beautiful. I recommend going in the summer when you can have your own table and you don't have to fight for chairs...  Babcock Dairy sells ice cream here, too.  I posted photos of my son eating the Blue Moon Ice cream. Totally delicious no matter what flavor!  The cafeteria is pretty good, the prices are reasonable (although I am not a student on a student budget) and there are movie nights and live music as well.  This is just the heart of the summer when it comes to living or visiting Madison, WI.

This is a beautiful resort with amazing customer service. Our room was lovely and the poolside food was delicious. We had an issue with our room that was quickly resolved.  I was a little dismayed in that the pool security left at 5 and then folks came to movie night (dive in) to drink and smoke. We had to move seats 3x to get away from the smoke. Folks were ashing out right by the pool. A little frustrating for my son who came to watch the kid friendly (Igor) PG rated movie. I like smoking myself but when little kids are running around it isn't appropriate, and so close to the pool is really kinda filthy (I don't want my son swimming in ash soup, pretty please!)  The fireworks are worth noting, they were great!! ...and we lived the kids club and meeting the turtles!!  The young men and women in the kids club are great!!!  My son is 13 and he still found a way to meander into the kids club and hang out.  Most other resorts have these kids clubs that target the little guys and that no longer appeals to him (we are locals, so this was a 'staycation' which we have done at other resorts.)  The pools are so big and there was space, even on a crowded weekend. The security was a little stiffing, but without it, we might have to deal with more crowds and coolers of beer.  I appreciated that they let us bring in water, etc so mostly it was crowd control.  Finally, the kids pool (there wasn't an adult only pool, but one was significantly quieter) was really fun at night, with neon glow sticks and a DJ and slides with fog.  At first the kid thought it was too "radio Disney" but eventually even he thought it looked too tempting and we both had so much fun hanging out there at night after the movie.  Oh yeah, finally finally finally...we liked the zip line. Hope it stays! It was so fun..and my son is heavy enough his feet got wet zipping over the fountain in the pond! Super neat!  My husband wants me to mention that he was working there that night and his band was playing for a wedding.  The band was treated as well as the wedding guests. Whether this was a standard of the resort or the hosts, we don't know, but the food was excellent at the convention center as well and the service was really outstanding.    Nearly a 5 star!!  If they could fix the smoking issue and maybe remove the dead fish beached out  in the pond by the zip line..it would have been a 5 star - and those are both easy fixes :-).  We would go again...maybe when my husband doesn't have to work!

This place rocks...it's simply the best neighborhood bar, with the greatest old timers hanging out there. I always enjoy my food, my drinks and the company - no one drinks alone here.  Where else can you find a salad bar from the 70's still up and functioning with bacon bits...  There is a great burger deal on Tuesdays (I think) and they ahve a neat little patio with a TV.

The ONLY bad thing about this place is the location - it's hidden in a gem of a patio locale in the middle of north central phoenix.  You won't find it if you don't know where to go...so call ahead and ask for specific directions.  That being said, I was STUNNED at how goo this place was.  I love the Sangria, and the shrip cocktail is so unique I hate that I just called it a cocktail.  I want my VIP card...how does that work?  I would go all the time...if it was open later and on Monday (divorced single mom who goes on dates on Monday nights.)

I love the Lost Leaf for not ony becuase it's cool and hip, but because I am always made to feel welcome and relaxed - as I am not that cool or hip.  The crowd varies, but I like to go on Sunday night and listen to Jazz.  They have had some great bands there and I like how they prefer the local talent - the artists, the musicians, and the bevies.  There is no food, which is really sad.  I wish they had packaged food to nosh on, or took the approach that SideBar did wtih the package nosh (hummus and chips, etc.) Too bad.

I really liked the flooring choices and the prices. They were great to work with. Dale Marshall was our sales rep and our installation crew was delightful to share a home with.  We had them come back and do our bathroom as well.  Neat folks!    The only setback was that the follow up was less than I had hoped.  We had a couple issues with the flooring and Dale gave us some immediate help, but the installation specialists all seemed rushed and ready to move on to other projects.

I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!   When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint "ornament" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.    We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!

This is one of our favorite sushi places - the people are warm and very open, and the food is incredible!  We feel the portions are generous, the treatment authentic enough, and the options for feasting are endless.  I am not sure why they got only 4 stars - maybe I am just in love with the fact that we can walk there!

I really enjoyed this dining experience. It's a walk up and order place, but the service is so good. They bring everything to you and it's really amazing - the BREAD in particular was incredible.  I also recommend the pastries and desserts.  The wine was delicious and the pizzas looked amazing. Check it out!

I don't have a dog, but I do have a 10 year old and this park is wonderful.  We have held birthday parties here, I have had 1st dates here, we have flown kites here, we have seen concerts and movies here, and we have gone here for no reason at all - just to run around.    The park is ideal for groups of kids wanting to run around.  Hills and large open grassy spaces make it perfect for picnics and rolling around.  The park and the bathrooms are clean, and I always feel very safe here and have met some really nice people.  I feel bad for the folks who have Dogs and are disappointed.  The rest of the park and it's purpose are well above expectations.

I love this place so much I am anxious about writing a review!  It's just a delightful slice of heaven.  The food it delicious - especially the salads!  They are so generous and very unique and yummy.      I like the breakfasts -- my son even likes the food there!  The meat plate is fun to eat with wine.  I love being outside - the fire pit, the trees, and the music!  I love being inside, the big garage doors, the mirror, the scooter!  They support local the local school and they are so nice!! Go there...bring your family.  My parents like it, my son likes it - my fiance likes it.  GO!

I can't really review the Rum Bar without reviewing Breadfruit.  They are really one in the same, and Breadfruit's food stole the day. But, to be honest, we have never physically be IN to Breadfruit.  We only go to the Rum Bar and we LOVE this place.  I have been there 3 times. Once when I was a sardine and packed into the place without room to even breathe, once with my parents in the comfy window seating are and once with my husband on a romantic date for 2.  I loved it every time...and by the third time, I was told by my husband "YOU HAVE TO YELP THIS PLACE NOW!" and he then exclaimed "I think this is my favorite food in the entire city."    My husband is not one to stake claim on anything less than spectacular (he is married to ME!)  so here I am giving them the highest rating and review I can muster...  The drinks are extremely tasty, unique, clever and strong. I love the rums and the free tastings we have had of the various types of rum.  This place has really opened my mind and expanded my knowledge. I like that the bartenders and staff always ask our names and take an interest in what we are eating, drinking, talking about and liking about life.  They are so kind!  But...and yes, there's a but...the Rum Bar experience won't be bringing us back.  It's the FOOD that is the big draw. What a great culinary experience. Every bite is a wonderful adventure. The spices, the mixture of fruits with the savory dishes, the fish...oh the fish!  We plan on going back again...and again!  The location is a little tricky to find, but if you found SENS/Turf, it's in the same block (nearly the same building), but just around the corner. Don't despair, just walk south and take a left (east) and you'll see Breadfruit on the left.

This place was really not that good. I was sad...I was hoping for something delicious and spicy and authentic - being that the decor was hip and the location convenient.  The price was good.

Johnny did it again - the food is amazing, the atmosphere is surreal, and the sake is unique and varied.  It's very fun - and the only bad thing I can say about this place is that because of SENS I am worried about the fate of FATE.    Open on Mondays, which is key - and open late...just be careful, Johnny will kick you out if you don't respect the artists (DJ or musicians) - don't even THINK of playhing drums with your chopsticks or saying something snide.

Sens continues to improve.  We have begun going regularily and even got engaged and celebrated at SENS.  It's fabulous on Mondays, the staff is wonderful and there is no wait.

This is a really delightful restaurant.  It's cozy, warm and inviting.  Reminds you of someone's private home. We sat at the bar, and were really overwhelmed - immediately- and the warmth of the folks who work there and all the attention we received.  Had we chosen a table, I am not sure what it would have been like, but I could hear the servers talking to the tables behind us about their food options, the recommendations (based always on input from the customer) and the lovely specials.  Ohh the food!  It was unique, very tasty and fun! I loved the brussel sprouts, alway a favorite, and the fried chicken was the best EVER!  I don't order fried chicke, but it was tender, lightly breaded and succulunt beyond my imagination.  The best thing was that the wine and beer were on special so that we could enjoy a reasonably price night out, without breaking the bank or getting frustrated over feeling like we didn't get the value for the price.  It was ON the mark!!  We will be back...

I am sad to write this review.  We tried this restaurant twice - it's right down the street from one of my favorite dining spots, so we thought we should give it a shot.    We sat at the bar.  It was nice, but the folks at the bar don't take your order, only the wait staff does.  That's too bad because they were terribly kind but somewhat slow and really didn't seem to care that I didn't have a drink (I was late, so my companion had one) or that our plates were piling up while we were eating, or that we didn't get water....the service is one of the reasons we sit at the bar!    The bar was comfortable enough, but the chairs aren't really easy to "nudge" when you need to scoot in - and I am 6' tall and I can't reach the floor to pull myself in the right way - the chairs just stick in place and it's an odd complaint, but it's mine! :-)  I like to cross my legs, so I need to be able to pull the chair out to drink, in to eat, and back out to drink, and in to eat if we are eating in phases - like we do at a sushi bar.  The first visit we were delighted with most of the dishes - especially the hot dishes - they were delicious.  The second time we were disappointed in more dishes than we were happy with.  The rice was dry and fell apart, the seaweed was dry and super chewy!    I promise to go back one more time in a few months ...

Wow, I can't believe our complete delight at finding this wonderful little bar/restaurant. The food was fabulous and the drinks were amazing!  We had the chicken, the small homemade tacos, the corn on the cob (outstanding and unbelievalbe) and again- the CREATIVE, yummy drinks!  For desert I got the french fries so I could indulge on more of the sauce.  So terrific and so relaxing.    The only downside was the price and the service.  It's swamped on a Friday and the service was outstandingly kind, eager to please, warm and inviting...just busy.  And the prices were great for the food, but a tad on the high side for drinks. Of course, we had the house specialties! :-)

I really enjoy this location for music. The venue is warm and well appointed, with an actual stage and nice sound coming from a Jazz Combo every weekend. There are snacks, warm drinks, and some smoothies if you wish.  There is a couch and two comfy chairs, along with tables and bar seating int he back.  The venue is really inviting and the church members who volunteer are very supportive. Try this out, you won't regret hearing some of the Valley's best musicians.

This is one of the best ways to get into shape!   Let me take a step back and clarify that I am not thin, I am not at all that athletic, and I am typically not recognized as being "in shape" at all.  It's just that I am not one who likes to work out, and I have little patience with routines and typically try to avoid everything that requires me to break a sweat - yardwork, housework, jogging, working out, presentations, performance reviews, etc.  It's hard to avoid Boot Camp.  First, it's fun.  I credit Tammy and crew for that fun. The ladies are all professionals who have families, jobs and anxieties similiar to mine (see above) and find that waking up at 5:30 and meeting at a beautiful park and getting told what to do...well it WORKS!  We laugh at ourselves, we push ourselves and, more often than not, we continue coming back for more!  Tammy is a kind, warm, motivating and skilled professional.  She knows what she is doing and she makes every minute of the hour productive, engaging, challenging, and motivating.  It never ceases to amaze me that she knows EXACTLY when to push me and exactly when to let me notch it down a tad.  I have indeed fought back negative messages many times, but I have achieved more success with Boot Camp than I have ever achieved in any other work out program since playing on a sports team in high school.  Maybe I just hate sweating alone...so come on down and join us!

We were toally delighted with our brunch at Local Breeze today...honeslty, it was so wonderful I was really caught off guard.  We sat on the patio in the light rain, and enjoyed the heater and the wonderful service of more than one server and multiple visits to check on our meal and our comfort level.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Omelet (Chicken sautéed with White Wine, Chilies, Horseradish and Tabasco smothered in Cream Cheese Sauce) and my fiance ordered the Atomic Burger (Pepper Jack Cheese with Atomic Horseradish) and we both had a side of spicy cottage cheese.  The cottage cheese was my FAVORITE...but the Omelet and the Burger were both DELISH.  Niether were too spicy, which was a tad dissappointing, but both were filling and done quite well.    We also enjoyed a Bloody Mary that was made very well by Preston at the lovely outdoor bar.  I highly recommend this restaurant and have always loved the location and the space (which was a nursery at one time, I am told, and has a wonderful patio).  The best thing about this place is NO WAIT!  Why (oh why) do people stand in line at Matt's Big Breakfast (which has a basic menu and a simple taste experience) when they can get the BEST 2 eggs, bacon and toast around town on a patio with an AWESOME restroom (yes, it's the most adorable restroom ever!) here at Local Breeze?  It just baffles me why folks stand in line for that experience when they can hang out with a cocktail and play bean bag toss while enjoying good music and comfortable seating - even a fire pit!   I regret being so honest and delighted by this place - I know it will come back to haunt me when I have to wait in line next weekend.

I am getting much pickier in my old age, but I really like this place. We have gone there three times, and the service varies depending on the server, but it is usually always pretty good. Tonight it was exceptional. Three people milled around our table helping out with drinks, dishes, etc.  It was just amazing how nice everyone was and how well we were taken care of.  The drinks are delicious.  We both had martinis and they don't have top shelf alcohol, but they were quite tasty and really well done.  The prices were pretty good, too...I think martinis are expensive normally, but these were big and quite nicely priced.    I love the food here. I had a Steak Salad, shared some wings and enjoyed some tasty chips and salsa.  My mom and son joined us and she loved her salad and my son devoured the tater tots. The burger, however, was grilled and he doesn't like the "black stuff", so I got to enjoy a bit there too...totally yummy!!  I know we'll be back. The band "Sugahbeat" is awesome and they play there on Fridays (most often) and we love hearing them and enjoying the warm, family friendly, atmosphere...where can you drink beer with friends and let your kids get up and walk around and play Wii?  At home and at Arcadia Tav! Love it!

I can't believe my luck at finding Bryan Selberg.  What an amazing electrician and outstanding person.  I am not sure I can enough about this fellow.  One cool afternoon we tried turning on our tv and had some surge take place that fried our surge protector and caused power to go out in three of our rooms.  Nothing we could do would fix it....so let the calling began!  Bryan spent about 5 hours in my attic - over two days - scouring around a bunch of old insulation (cough cough) and a maze of wires that made NO sense to the handyman who had also spent a couple hours up in the same attic and ---- much to our surprise ---- he found the problem with wiring and our home was fully operational.  Then I drug him around and bet him a quarter he couldn't fix a problem we had with a shakey outlet and had him look at some open wires in the backyard (safety hazzard galore!)  He fixed both those things and with a bit of troubleshooting he found a dead fuse in a third unrelated problem that caused us not to be able to take bubbly warm soaks in our old, but cozy, spa.  Then...well...I can't tell you what he charged us because he would become so crazy busy ...we would never be able to have him come back again - but it was ...less...much less...than I thought he would charge us.  And, he never collected the quarter I owed him!!  When I am drinking wine by the spa and relaxing under the stars, it's Bryan's name I will be muttering under my breath...okay, his wife might read this...scratch that. :-)  CALL BRYAN NOW.

I am a Costco fan...for many reasons:  The Meat - couldn't be better, and what a great price The Cakes - Haven't had a better 'office cake'  The online resources - believe it or not, I received the best insurance rates from costco (car and home), I got a great deal on a rental car, I have a fabulous closet and well  The gas and the tires! - need I say more? Mattresses are top of the line -  Televisions - I love my Visio   Then there is the returns policy, the exec membership with special benefits, the zip lock bags, the samples, the discounted booze, the horrible crowds, the neat holiday gifts, furniture, meds, vitamins, and the parking nightmare.  Where did the salt and pepper cashews go? HELP ME ON THIS ONE!!

Why haven't I come here sooner? I decided on Hawaii for our last evening of a three- day weekend ...and it was so worth it.  My fiance, my 10 year old son and I all sat at the bar, played cards, watched Gilligan's Island and laughed a lot.  The drinks were delicious - I had a Pink Bikini and a Dark and Stormy.  My fiance had a beer and my son had a soda...no complaints, and the service was great and the happy hour prices were excellent...  Immediately we got our basket of super hot and delicious fries, which my son loved.  We then ordered some Tuna, Seaweed Salad and Thai Fish Cakes.  YUMMY all of them.  Especially the TUNA!  My son loves steak, so we shared his steak, the wasabi mashed potatoes and the amazing spinich side veggie.  The steak was huge and very juicy.  Excellent sized meal for a 10 year old to share!  We finished everything off with an amazing slice of Key Lime Pie and wonderful zest of LIME!  Loved it all...and I am so happy we finally got around to eating here.    John was our bartender and he was fabulous and very informative - encouraging us to try brunch and other food items on our next visit.  I am certain we will be back...

This is still one of our favorite restaurants.  Thus far I have taken my parents, friends from out of town, book club, my husband/son and just last night I took my brother and his friend from out of town who was able to just pop up to our neck of the woods by taking light rail!  I am always impressed with the professional way this bar is run and the fabulous food and the open air environment.  I love the poke, the fish cakes, the french fries, and I nearly always get the spicy shrimp caesar.  I highly recommend this restaurant STILL and I am delighted to say they are still open and doing a brisk business every time we go in.

This is a nice place, with a great ambience and wonderful stage.  The music sounded terrific all across the restaurant and the food was very good.  I liked the fresh nature of the food and the service was quick and delightful.    My fiance has had a couple gigs and he also enjoyed the venue as a musician - it's comfortable and the stage is nice.    This is going to be a very popular place very soon!

I really was impressed with this place, I thought the service was fine (but we sat at the bar) and the food we had was delicious!  We split a cup of olives and a salad - and the sizes were terrific, the pours were generous and the beer was realy yummy (according to my fiance, as I don't drink that stuff!)  The atmosphere was classy, but very relaxed - he was in tie dye, jeans and a nice leather jacket, and I was in a skort and a t-shirt with a vest (straight from my son's field trip to Tucson.)  We felt "right at home" and it was nice to be able to have a quick, somewhat romantic, drink before parting for our Friday evening.   I am not sure what would have given it a 5...maybe just worried still about the newness, the lack of organization, the who ambience wasn't quite up to par with my favorite haunts (SENS, Rokerij, Hana, 4Peaks, Roosevelt, etc.)  - but it's something I am going to keep trying because this place has so much potential - and we just weren't HUGE LisaG fans...so we are excited to see the patio and the new vibe.  Good LUCK!

We have gone here three times now and we all adore this place...which is a huge thing because my 10-year old is very picky about what he eats, but he loves the chicken and we all like the atomosphere.  My husband loves spicy food and is a particular fan of the pork. I love the chicken and adore the side dishes of rice and beans, which are seasoned in a unique way and accompanied with the most delicious (and fattening) hand made tortillas!  We recommend ths place and hope to try more items on the menu.  It was fun the first time we were there because we were able to see our torillas being made right in front of us! :-)  The only thing missing is the ability to make changes...which another diner identified as very frustrating.  It's very hard to get them to accomodate your individual needs.  For the price and the fact that there isn't tableside service, I think it's okay to sub out more beans for no rice.  Don't you?

I am completely floored by how amazing Paul's service is. I have never met anyone so giving of his time, his knowledge and his kindness.  He showed us how to take care of our water filtration system all by ourselves, spending more than 30 minutes explaining how to fix the problem we were having, how to troubleshoot another problem we may have in the future and what to do for regular maintenance of our system.  He didn't recommend we replace ANYTHING to fix our system, and he didn't charge us anything?  It was crazy.  He said he didn't have to repair anything, so he wasn't going to charge us.  I am never going to call another company.

I have never known exactly what makes a good pet sitter GREAT, but I can tell you that I have had only a couple GREAT pet sitters in my time - and JEN is one of them.  She's outstanding! My husband and I were leaving town for nearly 2 weeks, and we have a few cats, some fish, plants, mail, a security system, an old house with odd configured keys/doors, etc. and I doubted anyone in their right mind would want to take on the responsiblity of keeping our cats from pee'ing all over our house and keeping our home safe. But Jen said she was up for it...she seemed to think we were NORMAL?!   I wasn't concerned much about the fish or the plants, but Jen was, and before we agreed on a price or anything, Jen asked if she could take a tour of our home, meet our cats, meet us and discuss the quirks that we have come to love about our home.  She was thorough, taking notes the entire time, and certain with her questions and thoughtful about her recommendations for our pets and the safety of our home.  She was definately a professional!  This wasn't like hiring a friend or relative - this was her business! Whew...off we go!  Just hours into our trip, we got our first note from Jen.  The cats were doing well and even our shy kitty had been seduced out to play by a treat and a toy.  WOW!  Only a few rare folks even know we have that cat, she hides behind the couch for 98% of our visitors.   The next day Jen left a text message for us with photos of all three of our cats, and she indicated what each cat was doing that day and appeared to be aware of them not just on a "the cat was sitting on the couch" level, but on the "when I don't pet the cat right when he wants me to, he grabs my hand and bites it" level. This was amazing...she was actually getting to know our cats and caring for them JUST like we do!  Needless to say, our vacation was relaxing and worry free.  Our cats were happy when we arrived back home. Our house was organized and mail piled up and sorted by "type" with our bills and personal letters on the top for immediate attention.  Our security company never called us and our plants were more hydrated than they had ever been!  I highly recommend Jen's Pet Sitting. She's wonderful, professional, thorough and terrific with PETS!

This is a very wonderful theatre and an awesome experience. I love this place and it definately is worth the extra $$.    I do really wish it was a tad less expensive.  And I wish they served more of the yummy popcorn! It's very good!  The facility is super nice, but someone said there aren't kids allowed and I saw a ton of kids coming out of an age appropriate movie with their parents. No complaints, with the appropriate supervision I actually enjoy kids!  There are some mixed reviews here, and I have my own...but the overall experience has been 5 star worth.  It's probably really a 4, but it seems like the folks who own these theatres are really working hard for their clients and want this to be a great experience.    Some things still need to be worked out:  --The bar is silly, but very gorgeous and comfortable.  We just had horrible service, for no reason - we were 2 of 4 folks at the bar!  One bartender was wonderful, but he just disappeared and never said good-bye. The new bartender never asked us for a refill (their loss) but then the waitress from the theatre came and sat with us and she was so helpful and got our glasses refilled - so we tipped her later, not the  barkeeper!  --The birthday policy is odd. It is written down as the week of your birthdya, but actually the free tickets are only AFTER the birthday, not before it?  Not even one night before the birthday. So I am a single mom, married to a professional musician and well...Tuesday is the ONLY day we both have our evenings free this week for our romantic birthday celebration!  So, I begged this awesomely nice person in customer service (Frank Donnelly) and get them to approve free tickets. The managers, Phil Miglino & Valerie Irizarry are on board and giving me a free ticket, so we are going again tonight.  Thanks Phil and Val! :-)  -- The chairs are entirely tooo comfortable and we might fall asleep.  It's better than being at home!  The best things are: ---The chairs - go for it and get the reclining ones if you are going! ---The FRESH popcorn (who said it wasn't fresh, total liars...ours was awesome!) ---The servers who care! They are so awesome!!!!  I think our server's name was Candace and she was AMAZING.  ---The bathrooms are luxurious  ---The food is decent and the Tuesday pricing is reasonable for food as well as GREAT for beer and wine!

I am really, really loving this new restaurant and must admit I am kinda addicted.  That being said, this review is probably a little altered.    Honestly, I am not sure what I love the most. I have been there three times now, from a weekday to a Happy Hour and I haven't had any issue with parking.  The wait for a seat was minimal, and the patio was inviting as the bar was fun, and the tables are sooo cozy.    The cocktails are GREAT. I am addicted to the one with Ginger, but I can't remember the name of it.  I love the wine being on tap, it's eco-delicious.  I enjoy the company of everyone at the restaurant and I seem to see people I know there most often. The bartenders are a delight, they introduce themselves and talk a lot about the menu and choices, etc.  Even the owner/manager person (whoever she was) came by and asked what we thought of the meals, drinks, atmosphere, etc.    I also love the wall of tapes, and watching families bike in and get ice cream and sit in the floral decor of the comfortable patio with cute kids...very inviting. I could see bringing a date here (alas I am married now, so my date is my hubby), but I would also bring my parents and my son here.    I loved the Halibut, the Kale Salad, the snacks, the Sausage Sandwich and I can't wait to go again and try more.  With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist, the burning of Richardsons,  the crowds at Postino, the valet only at the Vig, the lack of fresh salads at the Garage, cold (warm) food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks.  Move over Hula's, SENS, Hanny's, TMI, Rokerij and CIBO! :-)

I can't believe how awesome this company is.  I live in Phoenix, Arizona and some really nice salesperson knocked on my door. I am very eager to slam the door on salespeople, but this guy led with such a compelling introduction about how he had been working in the area with my neighbors and would I care to know what he was doing with their roofs, etc.  I thought he was pleasant and not pushy at all, so we chatted for a while and agreed to a free assessment and potentially processing insurance claim if the roof qualified for replacement due to a severe thunderstorm that had taken place about 6 months prior.  As planned, the various steps for assessing the damage and qualifying for the insurance coverage were timely, well done and very professional. Every Jasper employee we met was so personable, easy to communicate with and terribly eager to assist us as necessary to ensure we were receiving the highest level of roofing replacement possible.  The roof came with a 30 Year Warranty on the Owens Corning Shingles and a 2 year Labor Warranty from Jasper.  The really amazing thing is that Jasper totally stands behind their warranty! We have these pesky skylights that are terribly leak prone, and they always have been.  Jasper has had to come out and fix the roof and test the flashing and repair the sealant for the area around these skylights, and then when Jasper broke part of the skylight, they replaced BOTH SKYLIGHTS free of charge.  All cracks and wear and tear are gone, and we have these gorgeous new skylights along with an amazing new roof!  I have worked with quite a few folks, but Brad, the area manager, had to come on the line to hear my woes about the broken skylight and he was immediately out to our site and had already pre-purchased the skylight domes himself.  What a GREAT company Jasper Contracting is. I highly recommend them to anyone who needs a new roof.

DO NOT CALL THESE FOLKS They do not stand behind their work since we have had "catastrophic events" since the roof repair in 2010.  In addition, they will not repair the roof that they replaced since they have "pulled out of the Phoenix Market" Ralph is the primary contact and while he's nice, he won't be able to do anything to help you at all.

My friend recommend these guys.  She loves her system.  I have to agree, this is a great system -- we love the technology. The installation service technician was amazing, super experience right up until AFTER they have your money. They refuse to help. I don't have any way of getting online, they are saying that they can not help me and they hang up on me. It's horrible. I can't believe I fell for this...and now we are stuck.  All I want is to add a couple doors to the system and it's taken over 90 minutes on hold over two different days (I was hung up on yesterday and so I tried again today).

There are actually GAMES on the TRUCK!!  It's amazing. This big truck pulls up to your door and opens up and there is a living room on the truck for all your teenagers! PERFECT!  I worked with Josh, who was really nice.  He was really accomodating and worked very hard to meet our schedule.  There was an issue on the actual date of the party nand he said he would send out another truck, which he did, and he was only a few minutes later than anticipated. The event went over well.  I have attached photos. The games were well liked, I don't think the kids really played any 3D games. They danced and used the outdoor game deck quite a bit and everything really was excellent.  I took a star off becuase I was promised a call back on Sunday to review the issue with the truck - which really wasn't an issue - and I never got a call. Other than that, this is a 4.5 star experience which I highly recommend for your next event!  See my photos!

This is a brand new music venue in Downtown Phoenix. It's very well done, with a nice ambiance and a section of the room set aside as a stage. Everyone who works there is terrific and very helpful, nice, etc.  The room is simple, the acoustics are well done, and the restrooms and such are clean.  But, that's it. There isn't a patio or really any food (except the costco type snacks for 1.00, etc.), beverage service, etc.    I would have given it a 3 star, but the venue is so promising I want others to visit it. The BEST music is here, and it will only get better!

I don't like pizza.  I have no idea why I thought it was a good idea to go to this place, but it was new and we LOVE Windsor and Churn and Postino, so...here we go...  Holy COW was I in heaven.  I LOVED this place. The architecture and the nice touches with decor and charm. I was so comfortable.  The server was awesome, and the wine was really good. GREAT choices and you can carry out wine too!  The food was simply amazing. Hands down better than any other place I have eaten in a while. I couldn't believe the Pizza!  Amazing. My salad was awesome, and the brussel sprouts are outstanding.  My son had the dessert and it was so cool...they made a pudding type s'more thing...I am not going to be able to do it justice!!  I can't wait to go back again. I am dreaming about the clever pizza toppings and eager to try something new.  Thank you for changing my life. I love Federal Pizza!  P.S. My birthday was two weeks ago and I didn't get a birthday e-mail.  So sad.

I thought long and hard about writing this review.  My favorite bartender (John) worked here for a while, so I came here two times before I wrote this.  I am so unhappy with how this experience turned out.  Let's get to the food. It was amazing. No complaints on either visit. The atmosphere and the food are top notch and you couldn't ask for a better concept (except maybe not a Starbucks on the corner, but I digress...)  It's the service I am reviewing so poorly I would give them negative stars.  We arrived one afternoon to an empty bar. It was a Sunday afternoon and there was one other couple there. Three servers behind the bar milling around between what looked like bookkeeping, cashiering and supporting the wait staff for tables.  There was one very busy wait person in the dining area who we thought appeared to care (woman, tattoos, short hair, super responsive to her tables.)  That's it.  We were at the bar and it was stupid. We were ignored for nearly 10 minutes. Ignored.  No one even said Hi. Then we got a hello and ordered drinks. They came up, but we never got chips, salsa or menus.  Another 3-4 minutes we asked for menus and water.  The menus came. No water.  Then 10 minutes later (literally an entire quarter of the football game) we asked if we could order dinner...that took some considering but they agreed we could.  We ordered and then waited. Everyone around us started streaming in and got water, chips, salsa, even napkins!  I was getting jealous so I asked for chips and napkins. Eventually I got chips and then the folks next to us got food and we hadn't even been asked if we would like to place an order.  Honestly it got more stupid after that.  I got my food, my husband never got his food. We shared my tacos and then his food came up, but not his sides. Then later his sides came.  Literally 5 different people brought us 5 different plates of something and then we got water  - finally.   I have no idea why we had no bartender and I asked for John and apparently he is gone. Well, so are we now. I am sorry.  I love your corn and tacos. Hugs.

It really happened!  It was amazing!  Okay, the review I recently left was not positive. No doubt about that. But the response to the review was amazing.  The GM contacted me and apologized and asked if we would return and see the changes they have made as a result of the reviews here on Facebook.  That is amazing! Our reviews make a difference.    Well, of course I would go back. I love everything about the food at Taco Guild.  So back we went. We sat at the bar...and within minutes we were welcomed and invited to review Happy Hour pricing. We talked about various drinks and met "Michael" - the bartender.  PERFECT!  Honestly.  I barely got my order in with Michael and the chips and salsa - warm and oh so yummy - were placed in front of us. Waters delivered promptly and dishes, napkins and utensils arrived immediately...it was magical.  Did we want to eat?  Yes, yes we do! We ordered tacos and a salad and then more chips arrived and drinks were filled and we were just settling in and our food arrive.  IMMEDIATELY.  Or well, my hubby's food arrived...my steak took longer than the expected so my salad was a tad longer to arrive.  Still unsure how that happened but...it eventually arrived and I had more time to monopolize the warm and tasty chips.  The salad was new to me. I liked it a lot. I would have liked a tad more cheese and nuts, but the fruit and streak was perfect.  The Kale was substantial and very crunchy.  I even took some home for lunch :-).  Kale is the best!  I wasn't offered dessert so I don't know if they have any.  I was offered another drink, and I gladly ordered one and left with quite a warm and happy feeling. For the record, that was three drinks and I was not driving :-).    I highly recommend Michael at the bar. He's delightful and very engaging.  He is thoughtful and attentive.  He works most evenings.  I observed him with the other patrons and he was equally efficient with everyone. Thank you Michael.

These 'gals' are amazing! We have really been pleased with the attention they give our three cats. One Kitty is diabetic so it's wonderful that they are well educated on caring for him and always update us with photos and quick text messages.!

My husband and I were looking to go out to eat downtown after his gig and thought we would check out the new restaurant next to the Turf...Pomo.  Well.  Guess not.  They were closing at 11 and we were ready to eat and drinka nd hang out on the patio.  SENS, why did you MOVE? I don't like the new patio you have...sorry...  I digress.  Anyhow, as the story goes, we were standing around thinking maybe we would have an amazing rum drink at Breadfruit and then we heard music.  Did I mention my hubby is a musician?  LIve music?  In this  building?  Wow...let's check it out.  We head towards the back to what is now called "Squash Blossom" and wondering to ourselves "didn't the big sign outside say Breakfast and Lunch only?"  Hmm...this is promising...  And it was amazing. It was like walking into another world. The seemingly boring back space that was impossible to fill when it was the PastaBAR is now hopping and I mean - HOPPING with people listening to latin music and dancing and drinking and loving life.  We had to be part of it...so we waited for a table to open up and snagged it and ordered late night eats and drank fun drinks that we had NO IDEA was in them and listened to live music and had a BLAST.   Everything is in Spanish, even the name...which we quickly realized was a Spanish version of Squash Blossom (who they share the space with). Brilliant (I love stuff like that). We were served by no less than 4 folks (primarily a fellow named David who was so charming!) who hovered over the tables like bees on flowers.  It was skillful and terribly flattering.  I loved that they cared. They asked for feedback on the amazing guacamole and offered suggestions on some fun drinks.  They asked us to come back again.  Who does that?  REALLY who does that?  They came by, shook our hands and looked me in the eyes and said "we would love it if you came by again and joined us for dinner, thank you for coming."  Honestly, ithis was one of the most remarkable experiences I have had in Phoenix.  The unique food and drinks as well as the lovely service and amazing patrons of this "Latin Lounge" made us feel perfectly at home - even though we don't know how to salsa or speak spanish.  The music was wonderful, the band was fun and upbeat.  And for you single folks, there were plenty of tables of ladies and some swarthy good-looking men to meet as well.    I would definately check this place out...we plan to go back for dinner very soon! What a find....

We really had a great time here this week. Mo was so very wonderful and that helped...my husband and I were out without our son on a date...and that helps... BUT, let's start with DRINKS! So yummy!  I had this amazing cocktail with IPA beer in it and it was GREAT. The prices were reasonable (all less than 10.00) and the drink was strong enough to make me smile all through the most amazing food!  We didn't get a side, and I am not sure if we would have...the tapa plates were a tad more expensive than I had hoped for, but they were yummy.    I highly suggest this...in an area where there is a lot of competition this will definitely stand out.

Ready, set, go...it's another new bar and grill in the cenpho area.  It's a new concept, too. Somewhat 'rustic, outdoors loving dudes bringing beer and sports to you?'  First impression was meh.  I was not overwhelmed by the decor and the low end cabinets / bar atmosphere.  In fact, it seemed a little plain and somewhat off putting in comparison to the fancier / hip bars in the area.  It was late, and we didn't have a lot of time left before closing, so we determine to push through the bland decor.    Then we met Ryan. The second impression on this place far exceeded my expectations - it actually blew me away.  Ryan (I think that was his name) was super helpful, nice and very attentive. He learned our names, used them often, and made recommendations for late night snacks and drinks.  He was very thoughtful and super attentive to the bar and the restaurant. He made it his business to know EVERYONE by first name - yes - EVERY single person who sat at the bar...even us newbies.  For that reason I now know the first name of the very drunk fellow who sat by me at the bar.  He tried to pay his tab with fake money ('Bourbon Bucks'), which the bartender politely gave back. Then he didn't sort his own money and shoved it across the bar towards Ryan somewhat indiscriminately.  Ryan slowly straightened each bill and only took the amount necessary (rounded down to the nearest paper dollar) for his tab.  It was so kind I wanted to hug the bartender for being such a sweet soul.  What happened next really made my day...the bartender called my friend a cab.  He refused to let him drive home and he even confirmed that the fellow had been safely stowed away in the cab with fare and addresses exchanged.    Now for the food.  It was darn good for late night bar food.  Smoked wings, with a dry rub! My favorite.  General helpings too! Chips and Artichoke Dip.  Yummy and homemade as well. Everything tasted fresh. It was really a nice experience to eat there and I hope we can come back for the food during the day! :-)  We will definitely be back..  So this was originally a 4 Star, but the bartenders service was so remarkable and unique, I am going with a 5 star.

This is a bike shop like no other. You will be amazed. Classy, fun, and very comfortable. Honestly, I did not want to leave! And the kicker...I am not an avid biker!!   First ...the bikes! The obvious draw. This is run by some SERIOUS bike dudes...they know their spokes and wheels and chains stuff. They will dig as deep as you need to go...road, dirt, grandmas and back. Whatever you need! Ask to see the secret room with the very, very serious bikes! Shhh!   Second...the hang! I am all about buying local and living the Phoenix artsy, edgy downtown vibe (think art studio, coffee house, spa, modern!) and this EXCEEDS that expectation. A cup of coffee, a snack and a new cruiser...visions of becoming a biker dance in my head!  Third...a massage! Yes, invite me! Coming to your bike house cafe soon!   Finally, the owner. Such a doll!! Ask to meet Jason if you are there. He is the consummate host with the knowledge to ensure you will be comfortable with ANY purchase...he thought of everything from bikes to coffee to the towels and the lighting.  He has the most infectious smile!  Go there soon and get your private tour now! It's bound to be super crowded before long...enjoy!!

I want to like this place. Great patio, clever concept, amazing server, etc, but I am a little outraged that they charged us for an ice cube. Am I missing something? I have never been charged for one before. Check out the bill --but I believe we paid 1.50 for an ice cube.   I am pretty are we won't be back. There are other choices.

We grabbed salads for lunch and they were delicious! Everyone loved the fresh taste and creative dressings. I was delighted that the prices were reasonable. The salads are generous in size! The only downside was the chaotic way you place your order and they try and pack your to go bag. It was really silly and tithe guy behind us had to grab his salad out of our bag. I hope they sort this out ....delicious!

I did it! Same day different location ...at work and home with hubby. I love the Don Quixote and we tried the hummus and pita. My honey had the Cuban with the soup and curry salad ... Awesome sides and big! I guess we will have leftovers. I was a little sad to find that the online choices are different and we had to order soup after the online order. Everything was ready. We want the green chili to rotate through!!
