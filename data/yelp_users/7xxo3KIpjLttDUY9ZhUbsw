We had dinner there and it did not disappoint.  My girlfriend is from the east coast and loves seafood and she really enjoys it.  The shrimp San Remo is a must if you enjoy shrimp, portabello mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  Halibut cheeks and scallops were very good.  I'd give it 5 stars but I get a little claustrophobic in the dining room as it is a cellar but I know that going into it.

I brought my BMW 750 LI in after an accident on the highway.  They were informative and did an excellent job repairing my car.  It was completed on time and I can't even tell is was in a wreck.  Thanks!

Ate at Shulas last night and it was disappointing right away.  There were 4 of us and the server addressed the men and not the women... not a good start.  We had 2 kc steaks, 1 filet and 1 shula cut porterhouse $45.  All the steaks were good except for my porterhorse and I do mean horse.  I don't know if I've ever had a piece of meet so tough.  The problem is the chef or manager never came over to look at and or to discuss the problem.  The server acknowledged how tough it was apologized and offered a free piece of cake.  If I wanted cake I would have ordered cake.  Anyway... they bring us our bill and it was $464.  They overcharged us $130.00.  They added another filet, another baked potato, an asparagus and they thought they would charge me for 2 porterhouse steaks since I didn't like the one I was served.  After about 30 minutes of trying to figure out our bill and the manager still not showing up, I demanded they remove the porterhouse which they finally did.  Very disappointing night for an expensive restaurant.  We won't be back.  Aside from our disappointing dinner the ambience is not very good.  We've been to Ditkas which is a sports themed steakhouse and it was great.  Shulas not so much.  Bypass this spot as you won't miss much.  Go to Flemings or Mastros instead.
