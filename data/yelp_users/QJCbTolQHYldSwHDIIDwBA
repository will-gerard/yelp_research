Love their Turkey Chopped Salad, Pizza, Wings, and Iced Tea... Very good food but the no servers or full service restaurant before 4pm kind of bugs me

What can I say about this place other than I started a Yelp account strictly to warn everyone about how horrible this place is. I purchased 2 $55 tickets for NYE which I was told included drinks all night and a champagne toast at midnight... What I was not told was there would be 2 bartenders at each bar serving 100 annoyed patrons and champagne at midnight... not a chance.   I completely understand being busy on NYE but this place has been open for years and should understand the demand in Old Town on a Friday night NYE when selling "all inclusive" tickets. After waiting approximately  25 minutes for my first drink I ordered shots as well because who knew how long it could take to get another drink. The bartender told me there was nothing he could do because he had no glasses. After waiting another 10 minutes I pointed to the champagne glasses hanging from the ceiling and informed him they were sufficient drinking apparatus's for the shots and the martini glasses had the ability to hold my vodka tonic. At this point I wasn't even upset yet. I was just happy to actually have a drink so I tipped the bartender $20 in hopes of him improving my individual customer service. Long story short that sure didn't work.   As for the "complimentary" midnight champagne toast I requested  2 glasses of champagne at 11:35 for me and my boyfriend. I was told it was too early which is where I really started to become annoyed considering it took a half hour to order drinks and I just gave the guy a $20. So I hang out by the bar for 20 mins and request 2 glasses again which is when I was told they were all out. I stood there the whole time and I assure you, I didn't miss them handing out hundreds of glasses to everyone but me. THEY NEVER HAD ANY.   I'm going to cut this short because I browse over reviews that are too long but I will say the night didnt get better. They never had clean glasses (or the right ones). The customer service was horrible. The drinks were poorly made and the people pouring them were rude. I was actually told when ordering my groups drinks who were all standing around me I could not order more than 2. THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE AND WHEN 2012 COMES AROUND MY MAIN REGRET 363 DAYS FROM NOW WILL BE WHERE I WAS WHEN THE YEAR STARTED.

My favorite place. I love the 3 cheese ravioli. Sometimes they can find you a bottle of Sparkling cider too.

We eat here often and it's always great food. Always great service. I would recommend eating at Charleston's to anyone looking for a great dinner.

We went last Thursday for my boyfriend's mother's birthday. The decor was fun and so were the staff's uniforms. The had live music and dancing, which was fun. The service was pretty good but the iced tea didnt need to take 40 mins. The food was great, the sangria was so so but overall I think its a great place for Tapas. I recommend it
