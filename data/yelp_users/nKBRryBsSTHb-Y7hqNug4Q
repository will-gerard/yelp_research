My first time here! Great music! Felt like dancing to every song. Happy hour was awesome! The crab dip was to die for and the hurricane drinks on happy hour were to good! Bucket of Queen crab was amazing!! Staff was super friendly and knowledgable. Definately will be going back!

If you can get past the wait time (which can be long especially on the weekends) and the loudness, the food is fantastic!! Best pancakes, omlettes and potatoes! Baked potato omelet is my favorite! Recommended when people come to visit, I've never heard a complaint about the food!

I can't believe all the negative comments. I must have went on a great night then! Our service was excellent! Lobster bisque was amazing and my 6oz steak was cook perfectly at medium well and melted in my mouth. Twice baked potato with white cheddar was fantastic! It is definately big enough to share between two people. Great wine as well. A little pricey but worth every penny!

Very disappointed!   Decided to try it for my birthday dinner. Went on a Thursday night. It was not busy at all but we were there for 3 hours just waiting.... For apps, drinks and dinner. Service was horrible but I think we just got a bad waitress. I ordered a martini and it was served in a lo-ball glass. Then my moms hamburger was almost raw. She had to send it back and it took forever for them to bring it back to her and when they did they didn't had any of the onions or cheese that originally came with it. They did remove it from our bill thankfully. Everyone else's food, Chopped Salad, Hot Mess, Green chili, Bone in pork chop,was ok. Nothing special.   Positives, restaurant is beautiful! And the pretzels are amazing! Also, the Octopus was really good but not near enough of it for $13.   I will be crossing this restaurant of my list which is disappointing.

First time here. Happy hour with a friend. Super cute place! Intimate date place for couples or a core group of friends. Good wine selection and great selection of different grilled cheese sandwiches! Acoustic guitar player set the mood! First time check in on Yelp gave a 15% discount.
