Such a bad experience....I purchased a ring on line for my daughter's 16th birthday only to have it fall apart after barely a month of wear.  I took it to the store where I was abruptly told that it would have to be shipped out for repair as they don't offer the ring in the store..it is only available on line.  On Christmas Eve I received an email stating the ring was ready.  Thinking how great it would be for my daughter to have her ring back for Christmas, we braved the mall only to find out the ring was still broken in half and they would have to order a new one for me.  Needless to say, my daughter was so sad as this ring means so much to her.  A few weeks later, I get another "reminder email" that my ring is ready to be picked up.  This time, I call the store first only to find out that the email is an error and the ring is still not in.  Finally, on January 10th, the ring finally arrived.  I thought I was done.  Then the Store Manager calls me to tell me I need to return the broken ring, which I never took possession of...he tells me if he doesn't find it that his inventory is going to be short.  Since I never took the broken ring back, I remind him I cannot help him with that.  Needless to say, I will not be returning to Kay Jewelers nor recommending them to any of my friends looking to purchase jewelry.

Tom was absolutely a joy to work with!  He was thoughtful, creative and captured our homecoming in such a beautiful way.  My son-in-law was deployed and his homecoming on Christmas Eve was the first time meeting his 8 month old daughter.  Tom was completely flexible, captured wonderful pictures and  went above and beyond and put them together for us in a short video set to music.  Tom is a true artist and professional and I highly recommend his work!
