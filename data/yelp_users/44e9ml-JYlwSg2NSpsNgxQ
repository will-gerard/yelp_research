While in Tempe with the family and the mother in law, we stopped in for some Pho for lunch We all had the Pho, My mother-in law who is Vietnamese, said the pho reminded her of Pho back home. Nuff said pho for lunch was great.  Service was great, though it was lunch time and we were 4 of the 8 in their at that time.  Really enjoyed the fried spring roll and the pineapple ice tea too.

Great Happy Hour Menu and wonderful staff and service.  The Happy Hour Menu now takes place from 4pm to 6pm.  Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks.  The La Hacienda and Prickley pear margaritas are really good.  If you are willing to try something new other than your normal Tequila ask for Danielle, the Tequila Goddess, she is a wealth of knowledge and she will definitely guide you in the right direction.  Try the Don Julio 1942 tequila, its a sipper not straight shot so enjoy yourself.

5 Guys is great.  Love the burgers and fries, though every time we eat there we have a lot of fries leftover.  Usually get the double Bacon cheeseburger with everything and A1 sauce, fries and a drink and always leave full and happy.  Finally tried a hot dog which was Great.  You can choose the same topping for your hamburger for your hot dog. Much better than IN&OUT and your burger fast food chains.  Yes a little pricer but willing to pay more to have my food cook to order than a reheated burger.  Very friendly and happy staff. The noisy atmosphere works for me and JR, he can be a little more vocal and not bother anyone.  Mellow Yellow is good but also good to see Coke Zero on tap too.

We always have a great experience when we come to Oregano's. Lately though I have been making my trips to Oregano's even more special by making it a Father and son trips. We would grab these two seats at the the bar right behind the hostess stand that are lower than the rest. Plus it makes it feel like they are "reserved" just for us. But it is Richard behind the bar that gives us that VIP experience. He is great with the customer service even when bar is full he always makes sure that we are are all good. It is because of Richard that makes us to continue to have these weekly father and son outings at Oregano's and sometimes we even bring the mrs.
