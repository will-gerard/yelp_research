They only care about making money and not the well being of the pets. They always try to up sell extra services that are unnecessary. Recently, I took my dog for a rabies vaccination because they sent me a reminder in the mail that he was due for his shot. After the shot, we received a receipt and no further information. The vet never asked me about my dogs past shot records. It turns out your dog only needs rabies shot every three years. When we asked them about it... They said they gave us paperwork and told us it was every 3 years but they didnt. They were just giving him the shot and collecting money.. No questions asked. How unprofessional! I will never take my 5 year old chihuahua back again.

Just don't do it.   Arrived early for cosmic bowling on a Saturday. The lady at the counter took down our name and told us that we could go for a drink at the bar until 10pm when cosmic bowling started. We grab a drink at their bar, then before 10 pm we headed back to the counter. The guy tells us that we have to wait in the long line like everyone else. We tell him that we arrived early and our name is on list. He fights with us and then decides to give in and assign us a lane and let us pay.   We got lane 16 ... If you get this lane... run! Our ball got stuck SEVERAL times and it randomly gave people strikes without the ball even being thrown at least 5 times. We had to go to the counter several times and stayed patient.   Towards 1 am I told the employee that we had a pretty bad experience and again our ball was stuck. I asked if there was anything he could do. He said: I will let you finish your game. (We only had 2 frames left.) I was not happy with this response but it was better than nothing so I took it. I turn around and the other guy Averill turned our lane off. I ran up to him to let him know that the other guy said we could finish. He didn't care.   We returned our shoes and I told him that we were very unhappy with our bowling experience. He tells me: well you only complained a couple times. He then said: you obviously haven't been here on a Friday or Saturday night.   This was not the response I was expecting from a team lead. I gave him my shoes and we left. There was no point saying anything to the employees. They don't care. They hate working on Friday and Saturday nights obviously.  They are unwilling to offer anything to disgruntled customers. I will never return here again! And No this is not my first time attending a cosmic bowl on a Saturday night. What an insult! Averill and the staff were horrible with customer service. They deserve 0 stars. I don't recommend this bowling alley to anyone!!

Dr Babarinde from Palm Tree Pediatrics performed a circumcision at Banner Del Webb hospital on my newborn on 12/12/2014. Just a couple days ago, (7/13/2016) I receive a call from a collections company stating that I have a bill that was never paid that they are working to collect on. 19 months later and this is the first I have heard anything! I do not pay my bills late and I have an excellent credit standing. All of the bills I received from the hospital for the birth of my baby have been paid in full. I never received a bill from Palm Tree Pediatrics because if I had it would have been paid. So I ask the collections agent why I never received a bill and she states that they had a bad address and the bills were undelivered. The address Palm Tree Pediatrics had was an address that the hospital had on file from 31 years ago when my mother had me at Thunderbird Samaritan (now Banner Thunderbird). I actually never lived at that address. I gave the hospital my new address SEVERAL times and all my other hospital bills made it to my home and were paid. Palm Tree Pediatrics wants to charge me a collection fee because they sent this bill to collections without verifying my address or calling to confirm it afterwards. They have another complaint on Yelp.com regarding a bill being sent to collections and it seems they have too many clients and just send everything to collections without following proper procedures to verify addresses. I should not be held responsible for a collections fee as I provided Banner Del Webb with the correct address and had Dr. Babarinde asked for my address, this would not have been an issue. Banner Del Webb sent me all the hospital bills to the correct address with no problem. Her staff (Athena and Tabitha in billing) are unreasonable and would rather charge me a collection fee than to have a happy client. I actually heard Athena in billing tell someone else in the office "she won't shut up" (referring to me) while I was on the phone with her! I have informed BBB and will be informing the hospital staff, my doula, Facebook, as well as other moms who plan to use this company if this isn't resolved.

My fiance and I came here on our day trip to Fountain Hills after reading reviews on Yelp. I am rating this place a 5 because of their extraordinary guacamole, pollo fundido, and green corn tamale. We ordered the sampler plate.  It was the perfect size for a couple to split for lunch and gives you a taste of everything.  Their chips were really good - no grease or stale taste. The salsa came with three types: spicy, regular, and green. The green one tasted really fresh. The regular reminded me of a half italian/half mexican sauce - it was very addicting and unique. The spicy was fun because it wasn't too spicy and had texture to it.   The food is great portion. The fundido is packed full of chicken with an amazing sauce. The tamales were moist and packed full. The guacamole was fresh and had great flavor. My fiance really liked the black beans. The one thing we didn't really eat were the fried jalapenos.   We plan on coming back and bringing friends. I know I will have cravings for that green corn tamale.

Wow, I am so excited this service is available. It is such a great concept. Joe Filter came to my home replaced my fridge filter, cleaned my vacuum, changed my air filter and even offered to clean the door that holds in the air filter.   The staff was friendly and professional. It was such a pleasure booking my appointment with Robin. She explained everything in such detail and really listened and cared about my needs. The service professional arrived on time, was bright and cheery, and seemed to love his work. He took special care for my home as if it was his own.  As a Realtor, I will definitely be recommending this service to my clients. I couldn't buy the materials (fridge and a/c filter) at a home repair store for less than it cost Joe Filter to come to my home and do it all for me. Plus, who wouldn't love someone coming and cleaning out their vacuum? I am booking with them to get my BBQ cleaned on my next appointment. Can't wait!

The food is delicious. We ordered the arancini and it was divine - crispy on the outside and warm/ gooey cheese on the inside. The pizza has delicious. The sauce had a hint of sweet which I love and was packed with toppings. Friends ordered halibut tacos and linguini and clams - both loved their meal.   We split the strawberry basil shortcake and the snicker doodle dessert. The strawberry dessert was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was such an amazing combination of flavors. Very unique and the plating was beautiful.  The snicker doodle was our fave.  The server was attentive and helpful for first timers. He was patient with us gabbing gals.   The atmosphere was intimate and comfortable. The exposed brick, wall made of wood with candles,  beautiful lighting, and rolled silverware in fancy fabric napkins set the ambience.  Really a great restaurant for a date night or just a dinner with some close friends. Highly recommended!
