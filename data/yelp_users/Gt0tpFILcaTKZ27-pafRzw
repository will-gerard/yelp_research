I enjoyed the intimate atmosphere, dim lighting, and yummy bruschetta. It was a perfect spot for my birthday dinner last year, cool & romantic.

I've had great experiences taking my Infiniti to USA Collision. Although my repairs were minor, I experienced great customer service, attention to detail and timely repairs. I'd definitely use them again!

The staff are extremely knowledgeable, each with their own experiences as hikers, climbers, backpackers, etc. If you want some very interesting stories from them, just ask!! They are truly experts. You could order whatever you want from the internet, but the expert advice, fitting, and service that you get from shopping at this store is priceless in an area where safety, functionality, & comfort are key.  They always recommend the best gear for my body type, trip, etc. The selection is excellent, every piece of hiking/climbing/backpacking gear I own is from this shop, and my family have been customers here for 15+ years.

I've been going to Cornerstone Women's Care for the past 13 years and have NOT had the experiences mentioned in the bad reviews.  When I was 17, my NP was able to detect a sizable mass in my breast and referred me to an amazing Breast Specialist who took care of me. After that it was normal Well Woman exams & a positive experience.   Two years ago I had all my Prenatal Care for my first pregnancy & delivered with Dr. Misti Bartel. She was extremely professional, I trusted her completely with my prenatal care. She's not going to sit & braid your hair & giggle with you, that's not her job. Her priority is you & your baby's health. Day of delivery she was a pro & I felt like I was in such good hands at Scottsdale Shea.   The ultrasound tech there has specialized in high risk pregnancies for a long time & is so kind & knowledgeable. I am now starting my prenatal care with Dr. Bartel again & their staff is seriously on point, organized & kind. Guess what...the receptionist is not the one in charge of delivering your baby anyway...the doctors here truly are wonderful.   Every doctor's office is going to have wait times, because the PATIENTS before you were late. Try to get a morning or right after lunch appointment if you want to reduce your wait time! Be patient & kind to them, and they'll be patient and kind with you, I promise.

My family & I have been taking our cars to Kelly Clark Automotive for at least the past 8 years, and have had amazing service from Jim, Mitchell and their team.   As a young woman, taking my car to a repair shop can be nerve-wracking because I'm afraid I will be taken advantage of. Kelly Clark is run like a family business, and they always take care of me and are very knowledgable.   They handle all makes, models & brands of cars and have helped out my friends as well. I highly recommend Kelly Clark Automotive Specialists.

My family had mine & my brother's birthday parties here when we were little. Such a great place for kids! There is a wide open field perfect for playing catch, flying kites, etc. There is a water play area that has a playground in sand & tons of water spouts for kids to spray each other with.   The small train ride is so fun & kids love it. I take my cousins here when they come in town, it's great!

I blame my mother for my love for Holland Boone. So does my husband. Their pewter serving pieces are magnificent and to die for. Now that I have my own kitchen, I have started my pewter collection, as well as other goodies from their store.   Which include:  Holiday decor & ornaments Candles Manzanita Trees (stunning!) Furniture Home Accessories  Price Range: Moderate to Pricey  (the larger the piece, the higher the price)

The Greene House is very good. Their atmosphere and outdoor patio is one of the best things about this restaurant. I took my husband there for his birthday & had the Fresh Pasta & Shrimp - soo good! The only thing my husband didn't like so much was his entree was a somewhat small to medium sized portion for a grown man.

My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here last weekend, the food & views were amazing.   As locals we've each been at this resort on multiple occasions over the years for a prom, weddings, brunches, staycations with friends, and we've always enjoyed coming to this resort.

I visited Prestige Nails & Spa on my birthday, excited for a Mani-Pedi treat for myself. I was not ready for my negative experience....   During my pedicure, my nail technician kept rubbing her boobs on my feet each time she had to lean over. Weird. I've gotten plenty of pedicures at different places & this has NEVER happened before.  I agreed to get callous removal removal, and she pulls out a cheese-grater like device, also never seen this before. When she was finished, all she did to clean the instrument was rinse it in the same water my feet were soaking in...GROSS. I began to picture all the other feet it had touched without being properly sanitized.   I was hounded to get a flower on my toes, by three people including my technician. I politely said "No thank you" each time but I should have said "No...I'm not 12."  When it was time for my manicure, there were plenty of manicure stations open, but instead my technician decided to do my mani in the pedicure chair. I had to balance the bowl on the armrest that I was soaking my hands in. Not to mention having to be awkwardly twisted to one side the whole time.  When she was finished, the paint was SO FAR from my cuticle it was embarrassing. Within two days 60% of my manicure was gone...also has never happened before.I considered to not tip her at all. When I went to pay, she saw cash in my wallet and said "You pay me in cash!" How presumptuous!! I said, "I wasn't planning to, can I just tip you on my card?" I feel that she pretended not to understand what I was saying and replied "I can get you change." The woman whom I asked for change from asked if I wanted two 10's. Yeah right. You're geting a $5 tip if you're lucky. She scoffed at my $5...I now wish I had not handed it to her.   I WILL NOT be a returning customer.

Dr. Reed has been the dentist for myself, my dad, and multiple people in my office for 4+ years, and there's a reason we keep referring his practice to our friends and family.  I had a lot of dental work as a teenager and have seen a lot of dentists, and I am very impressed by Dr. Reed & his staff.  His staff is organized and they are on time for my appointments. They even allowed my newborn in her carrier to stay up at the front desk with them while I got my cleaning. I've always been met with kindness and professionalism, on top of excellent dental care. I highly recommend!

I love Sauce, oh so much. Their food is always fresh and everything I have had there is AMAZING. They have great salads with large portions, their pasta dishes are to die for, and I always ask for an extra bread because its just really good.   Great place for a casual date night, girls night or just want to eat some good food!

I met my husband and some friends for dinner here & we had a good experience. The food came out quickly, & while I always order the same thing at sushi places, I was very pleased with my meal. We were the only ones in there on a Tuesday night, but we weren't complaining! I'd go there again.

I have had nails services done 3 or 4 times at this salon and I think it is over priced for the quality of work, and they dont take walk-ins on Sundays.   The last time I was there, the lady who did my nails spilled callous remover gel on the towel that my legs were resting on, causing the gel to eat away at my skin. It started as an itchy irritation that I had no idea what is was from, but by the time I showered in the morning I had a baseball-sized WOUND on the back of my leg. I called the salon, and was offered NOTHING to make up for this, with the lady that did my nails saying that I just had sensitive skin. I WILL NEVER RETURN.

I loved my first experience at 5th and Wine! After multiple girlfriends have raved about this place, I was able to experience it for myself last night. I loved the Portobello Burger with Goat Cheese and Carmelized onions, & the sweet potato fries were awesome.  Its a nice, quiet place with dim lighting and intimate seating. It's perfect for a date night or girls night :) Ours was the latter.

Family friendly atmosphere with a sport bar area that is off to the side of the restaurant. All the staff we encountered were friendly & helpful in getting a high chair set up.  The pizzas my husband has orders look amazing, I've snuck a few bites and they are tasty. I ordered the mushroom club, & it was a good warm sandwich. Next time I'm going to try one of their salads :)

My husband LOVES this place! He is there all the time to hang out & smoke cigars with his dad and friends. Its a great "guys" hang out place, plus they have rows of built in humadors built into the walls to 'rent' for a monthly fee. Pretty cool concept.

For the person who knows what they are looking for & where to find it, this place will be your living hell.   As you walk down the aisle, Sales Associates will pop out at you every 3 feet to ask if you need help. I seriously feel like I need a fly swatter in this store to bat off all the bored employees who are stalking me. Two words: over staffed. I want to yell at them, "Leave me alone!" My stress level highly increases whenever I walk into Buy Buy Baby. Then, once you go to the "Self-Serve" wrapping station, there will always be a middle-aged woman hovering over you trying to hand you ribbons, no thank you, I've got it.  The only good thing about this store is the selection, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would never register here in a million years!

I have been going to Candy for 10 years and she is amazing! She listens to the changes that I want to make to my "usual" and is so great. Whenever my friends got a botched highlighting job or haircut, they always go back to Candy to fix it.  Vita Bella is clean & beautifully decorated with a warm atmosphere. It is bizarre how many people I know that go to Vita Bella! My sister-in-law goes to Lisa Stinelli to get her nails done, and they always look fantastic. Everyone I've come in contact with is so talented at this salon!

My husband liked this place, & it wasn't for me.  The restaurant was really tiny,  The service was fast & the food came out quickly, but the pork was really weird that came in the ramen. The noodles were good, & so was the fried rice. But the pork made me gag, and I normally like pork.  Not what I was expecting. Neither of us would go back.

This is a great coffee shop for anytime of any day. During the evenings they have live artists come in and play, and it just has a really positive atmosphere.  There are tons of comfy chairs to sit and relax in, AND it's close to the parking lot, so its so easy to get to if you're in a hurry & just need coffee or if you want to stay and hang out.

Yes, the tea is good. Great even.  But as I explained to my husband after trying a sample from a Teavana employee, "Tea is inexpensive, let's just check it out." The tea I tried was $12 for 2 oz...which I found out after I asked for 4 oz. I changed my order to 2 and the female employee seemed put off. I mentioned I brewed my loose-leaf tea in my coffee maker and she was appalled, and then tried to sell me every loose-leaf tea pot in the store. When I said no to one she whipped out another one, all the while my husband was sitting back and laughing.  The sales associate was telling me how to do this, that and the other like I've never prepared tea before in my life. Hello! If I'm in a tea store, then I drink tea often.  $34 and 4 oz of tea later, I will not be returning.

I enjoyed True Food's organic and healthy menu, and with a daiy-free diet it was easy to substitute goat cheese into my meal. It is easy for your bill to add up quickly, but if you & your date just order an entree, salad & water, it's not bad at all.

We stayed at the Westin for a stay-cation and had a great experience! The room was large, classy & luxurious. Besides thy every nice room, our next favorite thing was being walking distance to so much to do.  The rooftop pool was small, but nice to lay out at. We couldn't find street parking on a weekend, so unfortunately we had to pay the pricey fee to valet our car there.  The restaurant downstairs was pricey for mediocre food & small portions. The patio outside was very nice, with a water feature and live music on certain nights.

Once you try to cancel your membership GOOD LUCK TO YOU. I tried to cancel over the phone, but it is their "policy" for YOU to drive to their store to cancel. Since it was ONE day past th day that they charge, I had to pay $22 even though I would not use that month since I was cancelling... I tried not to chew out the girl behind the counter, & I paid the money so I could leave. NOW they have overdrafted my old bank account for THIS month, even though I went in store and have it in writing that my membership is cancelled. Not only am I writing this review, but I am going to report them to the Better Business Bureau because they have now TAKEN $42 of my money & I refuse to let them get away with this.  RESOLUTION:  This issue happened a few months ago, and one of the managers helped me in getting the amount refunded to my account. There is no doubt that their policies & account system needs to be updated, but I am glad that the managerial staff stepped in and took care of me once I informed them of this issue. However, I will not return as a customer.

The Cupcake Cafe is so wonderful! The owner, Nicki created the most amazing cupcakes for the 250 guests at my Wedding in October 2011. We had an equal amount of the flavors Wedding Cake, Red Velvet, & Chocolate, all with edible glitter!  People were literally sneaking them from the cupcake table, which was hilarious. I'm so happy everyone loved them! Not only that, I still get continuously asked by friends & family 3 months later where I got our cupcakes from, & always send them to Nicki at The Cupcake Cafe :)  You can see pictures of our cupcakes & cupcake stand Nicki brought for us here:  http://theolsenadventures.blogspot.com/2012/01/our-wedding-details.html

I came here with 5 coworkers and we had a blast! It was a great activity to do with a group of people, or on a date night.   They had a specific painting that everyone was painting, as the instructor gave direction. I was happy that they encouraged me to do my own piece if I wanted, I'm glad there weren't too many rules. I'd absolutely go again!

I love Pita Jungle and I am so happy there is one near me. It is pretty packed most nights and especially weekends. It is a great place for a fresh dinner that's not fried in grease!  The service is sometimes great, sometimes average. Last time our waitress showed us the wine specials, then suggested one of the only wines that wasn't on special. We didn't notice until we got our bill, it wasn't a huge price difference but felt kind of shady of her to not mention it.

I have tried every nail salon in a 10 mile radius of Norterra, and this one is the best! It is comparable to a nail salon in Scottsdale without the jacked up prices. Every time I have gotten my nails done here I am very happy with the result. Definitely recommend!  Cash tips only!

This event happens twice a year (Spring & Fall) at West World , and has become one of my favorite outings for a girl's day! Early admission Sat. at 8am is $10, all day admission at 10am is $5 and worth it!   Live acoustic music and dozens of vendors fill West World's indoor venue with so many goodies that you will want to take home with you including vintage & hand painted furniture, jewelry, accessories, home décor, clothing, children's items, and more.  Vendors are trying to be more stroller friendly in their space, but I recommend taking the Ergo or getting a sitter while you shop because there is so much to see. There is one coffee vendor and a food truck once you are inside. Enjoy!
