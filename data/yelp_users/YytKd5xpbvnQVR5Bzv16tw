I have had two surprises recently, how AWESOME El Zocalo's is and how low some people have reviewed this restaurant, but everyone has their own experiences.    My GF and I went based off of a recommendation from a friend.    The place was packed due to rain and not being able to sit anyone outside.  The host told my GF and I 45 min and we waited about 20-25 min.  We were seated at a small table, but had no issues switching to one more spacious.    Now, for the food, first the chips and salsa were really good, kind of addicting.  We ordered a margarita which was pretty tasty, and definitely had an adequate amount of alcohol.  I ordered the ahi tuna tacos and my gf ordered chicken hard tacos.  We both thought the food was great, especially the beans and rice.  For both my GF and I, growing up in Mexican families we are both pretty picky about the quality of the beans and rice and have judged mexican restaurants on them alone.  I would go back just to eat the beans and rice by themselves.    Lastly, our waiter, Chris, was on point.  Very attentive and good attitude.  The place is a little pricey, but you get your money's worth in the food.

I came here because of the reviews off of Yelp, but the hype for this place is excessive.   First, this place is overpriced.  I don't mind paying extra for something that is worth the price, but the Pho here is mediocre.  I should not have to add a large amount of "Cock" sauce just to flavor the dish.    Second they have a small selection of Pho dishes and the wait staff is slow as hell.  This could have been resolved by having additional wait staff on the clock, but I guess the management was trying to save money.    Lastly,  the portions are small in comparison to most Pho restaurants.  I had finished my meal in about five bites.    I am guessing the ownership is probably  business oriented and not food oriented.  "Make everything seem special, and the rest will fall in place."  That kind of idea does not work in a restaurant setting.    The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the restaurant looked nice, but I know now if I want good Pho at a good price the restaurant should not look like an art gallery.  I am also guessing most who have wrote reviews for this place gave it such a high rating because of what the restaurant looked like.  There is definitely better Pho restaurant choices in Mesa/Tempe/Chandler.

This is my new favorite place to eat breakfast!  My fiance' and I were on our way to get some breakfast burritos.  We zigged instead of zagged, saw a sign and turned in to try it.    Yoli's is cozy, with a great group of employees.  I had the hamsteak, country potatoes, and two eggs over medium.  The fiance' had a chorizo and egg burrito, and we both had coffee.  Both dishes were simple, but very good, to include the coffee. The fiance' let me have a bite of her burrito and it is definitely one of the best chorizo and egg burritos that I have ever had, and I have ate a lot of them.  The best part of all are their prices.  Super cheap for the quality and quantity of food that you get.   Before this morning, if my fiance' and I wanted a light breakfast to start our Sundays it would usually be either breakfast burritos from a taco shop or we would go to The Coffee Shop in Gilbert.  Now we have the quality of The Coffee Shop (if not better), but without the high prices of The Coffee Shop.    I look forward to trying their skillets and biscuits  and gravy.  If you are just now hearing about this place go a try it for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.

One word to describe this place.. HORRIBLE!  I do not write reviews unless I have experienced the place at least twice.  The first time was a year ago, based off reviews that gave this place four and half stars.  My first experience, horrible food and horrible service (a server passing by the back of the chair my Dad was sitting in  pushed it in with his hip in order to squeeze between my Dad's chair and another's chair, instead of saying "excuse me" or "I apologize"  he just ignored my Dad's negative reaction).  Not to mention it seemed they had not dusted the place since the built the building.  Nasty!  My second experience came as part of a dinner with friends who invited me.  Again, food horrible and service has not improved.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all.

When it comes to tailoring or altering the tailor has to know what they are doing and do it well.  For me, getting a $150 pair of military trousers altered, I wanted to know that the person doing the alterations was going to listen to what I needed done.  Susan, does know what she is doing and she believes that her customers are the boss.  She will listen and offer great customer service with that.  I called multiple alterations shops in the valley that had been recommended to me by my military buddies and all of them were either in Phoenix or Scottsdale.  I did not have to drive 30 min to get my alterations done and that is a big plus.  Lastly, she only charged me $12 and it took her only 15 min to get my trousers altered and looking good.  I am recommending her to all of my military   buddies that live in the East Valley.
