Ok these guys are awesome!  Had one vehicle where I thought I was going to be a grand out of pocket on repairs... The team diagnosed the issue and replaced some pressure fittings, pressure washed the engine and got me back on the road!  Problem solved and it was 1/5 of the anticipated price because they took the time to diagnose the vehicle and do it right.  Other places would have replaced the rack and pinion without even thinking to check the pressure fittings.  Then they fixed my jeep with a simple fix.  Again costing way less then I anticipated because they diagnosed the actual problem.  If you are looking for HONEST, Quality auto services this is the place.  Plus Chris's service was great.  He called me every step of the way and kept me informed.  Great job Serious!

This place was empty and it took almost an hour to get our food and the manager wanted to argue with us about how long we have been here... Fairly apparent the waitress didn't put our order in and he was trying to cover.  Worst part two of the items were salads... Skip it not worth the wait! Manager didn't do anything about the service and the waitress was unapologetic.  People who came in 30 minutes after us got their food in under 20 minutes!

Awesome!  Steak was cooked perfectly and the potato hash was amazing!  The selection of micro brews on tap is downright impressive.

Very good quality!  Friendly staff.  Really good dining experience.  I was depressed not having go-round places after moving from Portland, OR where there are more go-round places than McDonalds.  Great price for the food!  I would definitely come back!   I had some unique rolls that I have never seen at go-round type places.  The young lady who was waiting my table was very pleasant and never let me drink go dry...

Not sure the negative reviews on the Gyros mine was huge and fresh!  The pizza was tasty and had a good sauce to it and the hummus was made fresh in house.

One Word Awesome!  I had the fried pollock and the breading was light and not overbearing.  It highlighted the wonderfully flaky fish that was fresh and delicious.  I had a side of French fries which are really delicious.  They are made fresh and covered in parmigiana cheese with some herbs.    The Mac N Cheese was nothing short of amazing.  You must order it! There was at least 5 cheeses and they melted together perfectly to form an addictive form of this classic.  I also had a side of collars which were also very tasty.   The portion sizes are ample and all the food fresh and delicious.   The only thing I would have liked to see is something for dessert to finish off the meal.   I would recommend this place.  Can't wait to go back and try the BBQ on the weekend.

My wife vetoed one of my old standbys and we tried the Pita Pit for the first time.   I tried the Dagwood with Ham, Turkey and Prime Rib on a wheat pita.  Similar to Subway you can then chose your veggies and sauces.  I loaded it up and put some Boom Boom sauce on it.  Unlike Subway they actually cook the meat on a flattop.  Also the quality of the ingredients are a lot higher.  The meat has real flavor and the veggies are super fresh.  I received my order promptly and it was devoured in a matter of minutes.  The combinations of what you can make are limitless.  Also they will make anything into a salad for an even healthier option.    They also have a Coke Freestyle Machine which is a major plus!

Horrible... I am still been dealing with a gastrointestinal nightmare for 2 days after eating at this place.  The food quality is mediocre at best.  I tried the Chorizo Torta and it was flavorless.  The fish tacos were still slightly greasy and also lacked flavor.  I think I would rather eat a can of Alpo than at this place again.  There are much better choices for Mexican in the area.  Heck even Taco Bell is better.  I hope this place close up as soon as it opened and something more respectable opens in its place.  Update:  Man reported on ground in agonizing pain after ingesting just one bite!  Do your intestines a favor and go savor the Mexican flavor some place else!

Clearly the other five star reviews are from the owners of this place because it is disgusting

Can't say enough good things about BBD!  The food is always fresh and delicious!  They use high quality ingredients and the coffee is always fresh.  On top of that I have always relieved excellent service!
