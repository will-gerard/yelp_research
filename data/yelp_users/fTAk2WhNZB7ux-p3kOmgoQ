Other reviewers have noted that this place is "hit or miss", which is 100% true. I've lived nearby for 10+ years, and have patronized this location dozens of time-out of convenience, and definitely not for the consistency or quality of service. Very rarely have I left a "happy customer." Today I brought my car in for the Ultimate+ wash, which is the second most expensive wash at almost $40.   The positive: For the first time EVER, I was not pressured into purchasing another service by the men at the drop-off spot. The gentleman simply asked what service I wanted, wrote it down, and gave me my ticket.   That's pretty much where the positives ended....  I took a seat in the inside waiting area (like every other patron, because it was 110 degrees out), and waited for my name to be called. I noticed that the wash attendants were coming inside to call names as the cars were finished because no one was sitting outside due to the heat. I waited a good 20 minutes or so, without my name being called, so I decided to brave the heat and venture outside, figuring that my car had to be almost done. Get outside, no sign of my car. So I took a seat outside in the shade and waited some more. After another 20 minutes (so 40 total at this point), and still no sign of my car, I decided to literally go looking for it to see where it was in the wash line. I walked back near the entrance and that's when I noticed a car, suspiciously similar to mine, parked on the far end of the lot. I figured it couldn't be mine based on the fact that I remained in the waiting area the entire time without ever hearing my name, and that it was parked so far away from the pickup area. At this point, I was hot and frustrated and ready to get on with my day, so I got the attention of a wash attendant, pointed to the car across the lot and asked, "that's not my Mazda, right?" He replies, "Oh no, I don't think so, I'll check and see where it is." Sure enough, he returns a few minutes later with my keys and a very embarrassed look on his face, and confirms that indeed that was my car, and indeed, they "forgot" to call my name when it was done. He apologized and offered me a COUPON to use in a future wash. A COUPON. He also did not not take the time to walk with me to my car to make sure I was satisfied with the service. Spoiler alert: I wasn't. The back and trunk were NOT vacuumed, and the interior looked as though it had barely been touched. To add insult to injury, they also forgot to use the air freshener I had requested. This experience was doubly frustrating  because I had taken the time to "pre-clean" my car that morning before I brought It in! I had already vacuumed and wiped down the interior, so there is really no excuse as to why my car is STILL dirty after paying almost $40 for a "premium" wash service. If you take your car here I would advise you to absolutely NOT pay for anything other than a basic wash, as it appears that all cars receive the same treatment no matter which option you purchase. Bottom line: Don't go here unless you have both time and money to waste. I certainly don't, and won't be back.

I usually love maggianos and visit at least once a month but my lunch experience today has made me hesitant to visit again. My boyfriend and I made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work. We arrived and noticed the reservation wasn't necessary in the less than half full restaurant. Still, we were seated in a terrible table situated next to the kitchen doors and a server station and next to a large party. Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for. It was all downhill from there. Our server was pushy and unattentive. Whenever myself or my boyfriend would order any item (and we ordered a lot-cocktails, appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert) our server would suggest a more expensive item and act agitated when we politely refused. At one point she simply refused to leave the table until we ordered the dessert she suggested even though we explained that we would really prefer to order our favorite. It was ridiculous! I understand that part of a servers job is to upsell but it was taken way too far this time. The food was good as usual but took far too long to come out and we did not receive bread until after our entrees were served. I asked for a refill of my soda when the entrees were served but didnt receive it until after we got our bill and I had to ask several times. My boyfriend and I have loved Maggianos for years but there are several other restaurants in Scottsdale with better food and better service.

This place is my go-to whenever I'm downtown. The service and food are always excellent AND they take reservations. Weekend brunch is a MUST-mimosa carafe anyone? The diversity of the menu is impressive and the price is very good  considering the quality of the food and portion size. LOVE that many of their appetizers are available in a smaller portion!

My dog, Kasey, loves coming to Villa la Paws for daycare! Whenever I drop her off, she is always super excited to see the staff and other dogs. I've also used Villa la Paws for boarding and grooming and are equally pleased with those services. Kasey has tried several other daycares around Scottsdale but this one is definitely the best! The biggest pluses for me as a pet parent is the totally cage-free environment, webcams that I can access 24/7 on my computer or smartphone, great hours, and the fact that my dog gets to spend time in both outside and inside play yards. On yeah, and the pricing is very competitive as well! Additionally, I've noticed a positive difference in her behavior-she used to be very shy around strangers and other dogs but now she is way more trusting and outgoing! If you're looking for a unique, quality, safe, fun facility with a very knowledgable staff then this is the place for you and your pup!

Terrible service! Consistently slow and rude. It's a shame because it is one of the only places in the area open late on weekdays, but would rather make the drive to desert ridge for better service and food!

Lori is the absolute best! My skin has never looked better! When I first came to Lori I was having a few different issues with my skin and felt like I had run out of options to help fix my problem areas. Lori took the time to get to know me and my skin, and customized my service based on my particular needs. She also recommended some products I could incorporate into my skin care regime to help with my skin concerns. I'm always skeptical when someone recommends products, because many times its motivated by sales rather than what's best for the client. Totally not the case with Lori!! Once I started incorporating the products she recommended, my skin improved drastically. I couldn't be happier! Also, the prices of the services are very reasonable-especially considering the excellent quality!
