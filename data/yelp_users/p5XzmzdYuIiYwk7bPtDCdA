We don't have In-N-Out in Oregon so every time I'm in CA I go. I was thrilled to find they had one near our hotel and would've eaten it for every meal if I could but self-control kicked in. This place was speedy considering the lunch rush, the staff friendly and the food AMAZING! I can't believe how inexpensive it is and appreciate the quality coming out of a fast food joint which I normally avoid. Still drooling thinking of my burger...

Okay so I worked at Starbucks for 7 years so I know how it should go and this one was not good. It's DT only which sucks as I was from out of town and wanted a second to see all they had (selection varies from market to market). We drove through and speed was okay but my drink was not. My shots were clearly bad and the milk wasn't steamed correctly. I brought it back to be re-made and they didn't really apologize or acknowledge the problem. At the time I was a partner so I was really surprised. I'd try Coffee Bean over this place any day.

I'm a French fanatic so I was stoked to find this place on a recent trip to Scottsdale. The place is adorable and the staff speak French!! I'm so glad my husband doesn't mind me translating the conversations I hear around me :) After being twitterpated we ordered food which was amazing-authentic and delicious. I can say authentic having been to France several times at length now. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to getting us out on time for our flight home. I even ordered a croissant to go so I could have a little taste of France on the plane although it didn't make it that far...
