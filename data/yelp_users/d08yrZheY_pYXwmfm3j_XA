First time I have ever been to a Starbucks where the service was not friendly. No one made eye contact or even said thank you. I grabbed a snack box that was already opened and realized as I was paying. I informed the cashier and she just grabbed it and threw it and stated "anything else?" Then the barista added syrup to my iced coffee after I stated please no sweetener. There was no line and it still took 10 minutes to get a plain grande iced coffee.

What an amazing surgeon and office staff!   I called this office after an unfortunate experience at another practice. A week after having 4 wisdom teeth pulled and some bone grafting I was still in a lot of pain and just didn't feel confident in the work that had been done. This office got me in the same day. They were caring, listened to my concerns, and carefully explained what I should have known in the first place pre-surgery.  After my initial appointment they even offered follow up appointments if I was still having pain and concerns. When returning to the office, the staff even asked how I was doing since the last visit and you could tell they were genuine in doing so.  I would recommend them to anyone in the valley in need of an oral surgeon.

Monster pie Sicilian style, every time! The best ingredients and sauce for take out pizza in the valley!

Going to a new salon can be nerve wrecking! I did a full weave, trimmed off 3-4 inches and I love it! Rachel did an awesome job!

The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was on point. I was happy to support a local business and the girls working were friendly.  The second time I came in I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scratching her butt through her yoga pants as she walked to the back to make it. Thankfully she washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it at this point. I didn't plan on eating anything but politely waited...and waited...and waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into a parfait.  It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait... Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top.  Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley.

I made the mistake of going somewhere else after my regular spot had a long wait...  $5 extra for the color I chose... Purple?  The lady that did my nails had such an attitude that I would have walked out of the manager didn't happen to stop and say hello at that moment.  After applying the top coat she put my shoes and and said have a nice day... I guess ill wait for my nails to dry in the car?  There were 6 pedicure chairs sitting empty. I didn't realize my presence was such an inconvenience. Sorry to burden you with my cash flow. I had asked for a mani too, but no thanks! I won't be back.

The Mecca of all Whole Foods locations in the valley! We love the pre-marinated frozen fish selection... Tequila-lime catfish and any of the salmon selections are great! Produce is higher priced than the organic section at other grocery stores, but they also have a much larger selection. You will never find bruised or already molding produce... Like at a few of the Sprouts around the valley.  The 365 brand is extremely affordable for people who say organics cost too much (however doctor bills cost much more). And then when you feel like you've had enough of a health kick... OMG their bakery... Macaroons, fancy cakes and pies. If you aren't much a cook/baker and you want to bring something to a dinner party to impress, go to the bakery here! Baba organic black lager is tasty. Thick premium cut organic/grassfed NY Strip or Ribeye is worth the splurge if you can. They also carry Desert Smoke steak rub that is made locally but I haven't found anywhere else. The cheese selections... Goat topped with fig and Marcona almonds... Okay I'll stop now!

I work in the restaurant industry, so when I go out to eat my expectations are a little different than the average diner. My husband had been seeing a acupuncturist next door, so I finally got to try out this place. When we walked in and I immediately saw you have to order at the counter then sit down I put my nose up in the air.....   Only to be brought back down to reality with an awesome breakfast. My husband got the burrito and kept exclaiming how great it was. I had the Santa Fe Benedict that had my mouth burning, yet I couldn't stop eating it. Our 15 month old had eggs, multigrain pancakes and sausage patties. The pancakes were so good, that we ended up stealing two from her. The kids portion was huge!  Oh and the coffee... I haven't had a bold Italian roast this smooth anywhere! I have to find out where they get their coffee from... And then limit myself because I definitely had a buzz when we left!

Let's just say I'm going to have to up my gym routine if this addiction continues. We have been here 3 times in 2 weeks!  I can't believe all of the money that is wasted across the street on bland food and bad service! This place is Peoria's best kept secret!

They are kind of weird about when they will deliver to our area and when they won't, but the pizza is good enough to make the drive ourselves. We like supporting family owned businesses and this family has been serving up delicious pies on the westside since I was a kid.

Our first visit was amazing! We ate at the restaurant. The pulled pork was tender and juicy. We tried all of the barbecue sauces and like each one for its own unique taste. The Mac n cheese was unbeatable! The corn bread was moist. The waffle fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.  Our second visit we ordered take out and ordered the exact same thing as our first visit since it had been so outrageously delicious. When my husband got home they hadn't packed any of the sides. Just our sandwiches. It was too far of a drive to go all of the way back to complete our order. It took 20 minutes on the phone for the girl to figure out a partial refund for the sides, so she ended up doing a full refund which was nice of her.  Our third trip we also did take out. The pulled pork was so dried out that it almost had a cotton like texture. The Mac n cheese tasted like it was a few days old and scraped from the bottom of the pan. The waffle fries were soggy. Maybe they just didn't handle the 15minute trip inside a styrofoam box well. They were out of corn bread and a few other things as well.  So, I'm not sure if this place lacks consistency or the quality had just gone down hill all together. Such a shame, because the first trip had our mouths watering!

Purchased a living social deal.. What better way to find a new salon without spending a bunch of cash and possibly end up unhappy?  I was also curious about how organic hair color would work on my hair that has been abused with Redken for years.  I work in an industry where we survive on tips, so I get it, its annoying when someone uses a coupon...but it also brings in a new customer base.  I bought my living social deal for $69 today (7/21/2014) and called to make an appointment.  I was hoping for sometime next week and the chick on the phone goes "uhhhh we don't have anything available for that until October 5th."  Coupon returned.

Food beat our expectations, which were high since this is a FRC. Freshly shucked oysters, so good! Definitely try the cilantro sauce they are served with. We also had the pretzels and cheese. So good you have to consciously avoid filling up on them! Filet mignon melted in our mouths. The special was prime rib served with scalloped potatoes. We didn't save room for desert. Our server was Mark. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick. He definitely completed the great experience for us!

Consistent food and consistent service. We always get treated like it's lunch at a 5 star resort, even when we bring the baby.  We love both ceviches, vampiro tacos, and I personally love the mango con chile margarita. And I honestly think they have the best Spanish rice in the valley. The tropical ceviche comes with sweet potato and beet chips that were amazing. I could have just eaten that they were so good!  Beautiful location and a great place to stop for lunch when you are walking around the Quarter.

I love this place! Clean location and friendly staff. The prices are average, so no complaints there either. I'm glad I finally tried a gel manicure. I work in the restaurant industry and have a new baby at home, so I'm constantly washing my hands, cleaning, dishes at home, etc. The gel mani held up for almost 3 weeks!

Two stars because they fixed my car in a timely manner and it seems fine. Lack of stars because they had a bunch of small charges that didn't add up. I had a crack in my front bumper on the lower right side. Somehow that required them removing my pin stripes and door guards and replacing all of them. When I brought this up with my insurance company that paid for the job the shops excuse was "it's standard procedure for any job we do." It's standard procedure to charge for parts not needed and 2 hours of labor for work they didn't really do? No wonder insurance costs are on the rise every year...

They finally followed up on this issue and my insurance company and myself were satisfied with the results.

Wow second update... That's a first for me. Anyway, my new bumper popped out of place from AZ heat (my best guess) and the pearl white paint from my bumper to my fenders does not match only a month later. So much for all those additional charges the shop justified as needing to blend the paint to match!   We will be taking it to a new shop to have the mistakes fixed.

I love local owned and I love BBQ. How can you not try out a place called Hek Yeah?! I ordered online and my husband went to pick it up. We did the meat platter to try a little bit of everything. Plus added a large side of green chili Mac and Cheese and baked beans. Both sides were delicious. Honestly I can't remember the last time I've had baked beans that were that good. Not watery, not too thick, just right. The Mac n cheese was creamy. The smoked sausage and pulled pork were our favorites for the meats. Super nice family that owns the place as well!

I wanted to love this place with it's cute decor and giant coffee mugs. We went in on a weekday morning where there was enough staff on for every table to have their own server. After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well.

I've been avoiding Chinese food in AZ for awhile now, because every time I get the craving I end up with a little bit of everything that somehow all tastes like the same thing.  I got a recommendation from someone in the area and decided to give this place a shot. I ordered for takeout and everything came nicely vented as to not sog on the drive home and it smelled amazing!  Crab wontons, spring rolls, orange chicken and the Dragon & Phoenix... No leftovers in this household. Giant plump shrimp that were magically not rubber by the time I got it home to the family. The orange chicken was actually chicken, not bits and pieces coated in thick breading. The sweet and sour sauce wasn't just pink gelatin, but a flavorful and visibly seasoned sauce.  We will be back soon!  Oh and if you think you know about beers... They carry Gulden Draak. The wine menu was nice as well... They even had Prisoner.

We've eaten here numerous times, but more often than not get take out. They have a fairly large selection of sushi rolls. My favorite is the Sunset Roll, but we also haven't tried anything we haven't liked.  Everything is always fresh and packed full of all the good stuff, not just rice with a spec of fish.   If you are tired of all the sushi places on this side of town that have menus full of California Rolls topped with various sauces, then you need to stop in to Doraku!

We had recently purchased a mattress that was just under $4k to help both my husband and I sleep better, as we both suffer from back injuries. We purchased from the biggest name on the market that claims 30 days guaranteed with a 99% customer satisfaction rating.... Not in our case. It actually took 2 months to send the bed back!  In the meantime, we heard about T&N from a friend and went downtown to check them out. I was most excited that this was a local company, but obviously leary that a good mattress could cost less than a 1/4 of what we had just shelled out.    The store is a large open/modern loft vibe. The sales guy was calm, cool, collected and not at all pushy. He answered all of our questions without hesitation, including information about VOC's emitted from the material. We were sold!  I came back a few weeks later to snatch one up and I've been averaging an extra 2 hours of sleep per night. When we unrolled the mattress from the packaging, it literally left no smell in our room. I expected to air it out for a week, but we were able to sleep on it the same night... And we had money to spare to buy a new bedroom set!  This is a worthy purchase!

We came in for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and were the only patrons... This worried me a bit since I had not been to this place since it was Satori Sushi. We sat on the awesome patio.. Actually ordered something other than our usual rolls that we get everywhere. Seriously the freshest sushi I have ever had anywhere. If we still lived in the neighborhood we would probably eat here once a week at minimum. Our server was fast and friendly as well.
