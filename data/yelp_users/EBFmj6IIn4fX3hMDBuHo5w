I just got my ears re-pierced at a 10 gauge by Jeremiah, it was a very pleasant experience, I'd definitely go back again... Amazing jewelry selection, a bit pricey but you get what you pay for, so whatever, right? I used to go to the one in Tucson, so it was no shock that they are probably the most professional at what they do, no dis-respect to any other shop of course, but it is what it is.  The Staff seemed really friendly also, I didn't sense any condescending attitudes toward my questions or anything. And I would feel very comfortable getting anything pierced here, they've earned their reputation as the best...  Looking forward to going back in a few months and getting some 6 gauge plugs, maybe something else too...

Ever since I've been in this city and ran into a few friends from college and joined into their circle, this place has been a ritual... I don't drink anymore but back in the day I got really tore up at Shady's, strong drinks, good conversation, a good place to hang out, especially on a Sunday. Friday and Saturday get crazy and you feel claustrophobic, but the regulars are cool save for a couple of prime examples of jackasses... The bartenders are cool, though they can be a bit abrasive at times, but try doing their job on a busy weekend and see how jaded you can become, right?

I love this place- It's not pretentious what-so-ever, the Ice Tea is good and has free re-fills, the Coffee is nice, the people that work there are cool/ friendly/ cute... and the bathroom sink is really cool also, if that helps anyone... You actually don't mind washing your hands, what a concept. The pastries are really good, but I wish they had more of a selection of Apple filled croissants in the afternoon, although the cupcakes look good, but as Frank Zappa said- "Some people prefer cupcakes. I, for one, care less for them."   Yeah, it's also a converted gas station, but aesthetics aside, this place is a great chill out spot for my Sunday ritual of actually relaxing from the work week. Check out the community board as well, it's nice to see what's going on around the Melrose/ Coronado/ Downtown community.  Enjoy

Paul B misspoke of his Baristas as "Batistas", I'm surprised nobody noticed. Funny, you know what Castro and El Che did to the Batista regime in 1959, I give this place 6 months.

Can you make me a venti skinny soy splenda no sweetener half caff cappucino with no foam in a grande cup while I explore plebian society while visiting from Mesa? The Willo is so edgy isn't it?
