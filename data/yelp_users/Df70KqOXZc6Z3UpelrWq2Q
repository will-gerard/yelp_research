I used this company when my upstairs bathroom flooded. My house was a mess!!!  I called the emergency line at 1am and they had someone out at my house within a couple of hours.  They were professional, timely and extremely helpful.  Thank you RF&F for saving my sanity and my house!

I took my car to this location to get an alignment. I was told they could not do it because I needed new shocks, struts and tie rods, a well as a new radiator and some other work. I asked for a quote on the suspension work only and they quoted me $1280. I was already suspicious because l had just had work done by my mechanic and he said nothing about any of this. I declined having the work done and tried to take the list of what they said needed to be done. They would not give it to me. I did, however, get the quote because I had that in my hand already.  I then called MY mechanic and told him what they said. He said nothing needed to be done with the other things but that he would do the suspension work for a total of $500. I took it to him and after he got under the car, he called me saying that the work didn't need to be done.  There were no leaks, everything was tight, true and looked relatively new. It just needed a alignment.  I am so disgusted that these men thought they could take advantage of me because I'm a woman. I'm so thankful, as is my wallet, that I'm mechanically aware enough to know something didn't add up. Be aware ladies, these guys are NOT honest and will try to take you on a ride that is completely unnecessary.
