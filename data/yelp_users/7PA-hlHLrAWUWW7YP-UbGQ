I love, love, love the Picado salad at Crazy Jim's, but today I ordered one for takeout and will never do so again. When they handed me my order, I jokingly asked why it was so small. She just laughed.   Now, when you dine in, the salad is large and you have enough leftovers for a snack later. And at $10 it's worth it. The flavors are amazing. The take out portion is half the size. Not worth $10.   I always add some feta to my salad when I dine in...and I don't mind--so much--paying an extra $2. But today, adding feta to my to-go salad cost me nearly $4 and it was sparse.   Oh Crazy Jim's, I'll be back. I just won't ever call anything in.

What a disappointment. My friend was excited to celebrate her birthday at this joint with loud music, tons of background noise, and what seemed to be a good vibe. All was good until the bartenders decided  "hush" the birthday girl. If you want to have a good time, this isn't the place. Oh, and did I mention the loud music and conversation going on with EVERY OTHER patron? Bye Becketts. I'm out.

So, I finally gave in and came to the "enchilada" restaurant. Yeah, no. These aren't enchiladas. And whatever these are, they're not good.

Delicious donuts. Period.   A few donuts to-go, including the chipotle limon, ginger coconut, and the horchata. I'll be back!  *the chipotle limon didn't make it home for the picture*
