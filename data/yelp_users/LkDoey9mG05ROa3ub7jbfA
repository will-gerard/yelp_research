Unfortunately this restaurant is closest to our office so am often dragged here by fellow workers and visitors.  Atmosphere is good, its generally always busy and service is very friendly and quick. patio is fun to eat out on when weather is cooler. Bathrooms are clean and overall the place has a good atmosphere. There appears a large selection on the menu - I find most of the items rather un-inspiring. There is the tendancy to go with large portions rather than quality food. maybe I'm expecting too much, but I'd hope for a few dishes that were a bit more inspired. My test of a restaurant is what they offer for vegetarians and they fall flat on their face for that.  Salad dressings are poor, soups are generally too salty and many dishes very heavy. Have to say most of the folks I go with seem to like the restaurant. The breakfasts are not bad, but again its volume rather than quality. Perhaps I'm wishing for too much and should consider it more in terms of a diner style food...

I have been using Fatima for many years to cut my hair. She always does an excellent job. Reasonable prices and great work.

This is not a super fancy place, but considering the reasonable cost, friendly and efficient service, great food and low key ambiance I have to give this place 5 stars. The lady serving us told me that this restauarnt had been around for 25 years - so it seems to have done well in a very competitive market. Strange that this was my first time despite having lived in Tempe for nearly 20 years. What was really nice was that they had several good choices for vegetarians. One of us had the Yellow curry in coconut milk with tofu, cabbage, water chestnuts, potato, carrots and onions vegetables in a light yellow curry sauce - boy was that very tasty. The price was very reasonable ($21 +tip) for a shared starter and 2 x entrees. We chatted to the lady and she was kind enough to give us a discount for our next visit.. The restaurant was fairly busy on a Friday night with a typical cosmopolitan Tempe crowd, but we were able to get a seat right away. The folks at the next table were trying the various deserts, but unfortunately I'm trying to lose weight - maybe next time....The Sangkhaya Coconut custard - a Thai custard made with coconut cream) looks good. We will definately add this to our list of great local restaurants. Give it 5 stars considering the very reasonable price..

These guys really work hard on their quality of service.   I bought an Azera in 2006 - it's a great car, but has had a couple of issues. Anyways Hyundai of Tempe have always backed me up and cleared up all the issues.  We had a couple of Nissan Altimas  which we used to have serviced at the Nissan dealership. However the comparison in service between the Nissan dealership and Hyundai of Tempe is like night and day. The Hyundai folks are great and work really hard to please.  The Nissan service dropped off very badly and we stopped going there ~ 4 years ago.  My son has a Nissan truck and also used to have Hyundai Tiberon. He found the same thing great Hyundai dealership and lousy Nissan service.  Not much else to say - comments in the other reviews cover it all.

Generally very poor and rude service. Have been in several times with same result. I get the impression that unless you are an elite athlete with a super-bike, they aren't interested in talking to you. Pity since it's my local store and I would prefer to be able to support them... I mentioned this to my son and he said the same thing - he'd received rude and off-hand service. Curious cos if a store wants to survive - friendly service should be a top priority.

These guys give awesome customer support and they know their stuff. We had quite a high level of scorpions and I had been spraying around the house with limited success. With a new grandchild now arrived who regularly comes over, I was "directed" to come up with a solution. Coincidentally I was given this company as a reference by a co-worker who has a rental in Chandler (with a large number of scorpions) and the renters had been freaking out, also my next door neighbors had two young kids and had gone to this company to resolve their issues.  Both are very happy with this company Anyways they have a very sophisticated package / program which takes several months to implement. This involves a mix of education, inside sealing, external sealing, and chemical spraying etc. etc.  They also have a calendar which tells you when to spray etc. . Did you know that scorpion levels are highly correlated to moon phases? Anyways - the program costs a bit of money, but in this case you certainly get what you pay for and as I said the service is outstanding. An example is they sealed the trap doors during the internal house seal (which took ~ 6 hours for my house), but they were very happy to come back around and do some re-sealing after we had some other workers do work on our roof space. As Georgia will tell you it's not an over night fix to get rid of the scorpions - the program can take several weeks or months depending upon what time of the year it is. Having said that since these guys did their work we have only seen one scorpion in the last 4 - 6 months and I must admit the program created a little complacency on my part since there have been so few scorpions around I am not spraying as frequently as I am supposed to.   These guys seem to be pretty busy - so it may take a week or so to schedule you in. However getting rid of scorpions is not something you can do in a week - it's a many months long program; so if your going to do it correctly - go with this company. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

There are a lot of good reviews here so not much to be said except that it's probably our favorite store. My wife is very picky about food quality and always looking for the organic option (or at least pesticide free).   to quote Sue C  "The quality of products is excellent. The prices are fair. The store is clean and the employees are friendly and helpful. The store is compact which makes it easy to navigate, but also causes it to become overly crowded at peak shopping times."   - is a good summary.  We did notice that on our trips to California - the stores there seem to have a better selection of items. e.g. They have a better selection of hard ciders (Strongbow or Mangers). Never seen them in the Tempe store. We talked to one of the guys who works there about it and he mentioned the same thing - he would see certain products only available for Ca or Tucson stores...  Anyways - still a great store

I had read several good reviews on this restaurant so we went along the other night.   The San Diego  Bay restaurant  is located in  Guadalupe,  the Yaqui Native American and Hispanic community right next to Tempe.  There was a steady stream of people, but not overly busy.  Restaurant appearance was  clean  and bright.  Don't expect top high flying ambience, just a typical local family restaurant.  Exactly the relaxed style we like. The young lady who served us very helpful, friendly and attentive, She recommended  the ceviche tostada for a starter which was  good and also the  Molcajete de Camaron (shrimp Molcajete) -  a shrimp dish cooked in a very hot  lava bowl with a light spicey cheesy sauce which was excellent - highly recommended.   Cost was $32 plus tip for a starter, 2 entrees and beer. My wife prefers less spice and went with fish and garlic dish - very nice too.  Excellent service, great food  - and the  wonderful  Molcajate de Camaron make this a place we'll take our friends to for something different. - highly recommended.

I liked the idea of using locally produced products, unfortunately value for money was not there. With a food and wine bill at over $100/person the food quality should be extra special. Our overall opinion was that the food was either a little too salty and or a little bland (most dishes). The fish (marlin) cooked to perfection, the butter nut squash great flavor and mushroom soup tasted like a packet soup - so some dishes really nice, but others either bland or over salted.  The young lady serving us, although very attentive tended to be a little too serious. A little smile or joke might have been in order.  We were never rushed and spent 2- 3 hours just chatting - setting was wonderful so high marks for the ambiance.   Just a pity the food did not match ambiance etc. I guess I'm spoiled by my wife's cooking.  8/18 update - perhaps I was a little harsh the first time-around. Second visit to the restaurant - food and ambiance excellent. Great way to spend several hours with friends

This is our favorite Italian restaurant in the area. Great ambiance - it's always busy. If you don't reserve ahead - can be a bit of a wait on Fridays or Saturday nights. We usually go along a little later to miss the rush and can get seated right away after 8:30pm  They have recently expanded to include the shop that used to be next door. Bar has been moved over and now more entrance space in the lobby.  The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and there seems to be very little turn-over since it's often the same folks we see serving in the restaurant year after year. My wife loves the Ravioli di Zucca (butter nut squash) dish - slight hint of nutmeg and goof for vegetarians. I usually go with the Seafood Fradiavolo (mussels, shrimps, calamari etc. with linguine pasta). We should experiment more, but love these dishes so always go with them. The house Chianti is very nice - can never remember the name.  Dishes come with a salad or soup. Salad ingredients always fresh , but perhaps they could change it up a little.  We have had the odd hiccup  over the years, but forgive them the odd lapse since on average the service and food are great.

Must admit we still love coming here with the family. Overall it's a little more pricey than some of the other Italian restaurants around here,  Service has always been good with many of the same  face servers around which is always a good sign.  Also like the ambiance of the new extension / wine bar. Because it is so popular it does fill up quickly esp. on the Friday / Sat evening rush after 5:30 pm. We find it's better to reserve ahead and go early or go later say after 8 pm. The only disappointment is the lack of variety for vegetarians. my wife gets a little fed up with the lack of variety.  Marked them down a half star for that plus a serious mis-cue on the seating last New Year (or was it Christmas?)  - we had reserved a table, but still had to wait an additional 45 mins (because of  the apparent complication of seating a young child). Anyways forgave them that - just hope they have more vegetarian options in the future.

This place can get very busy. A sign of good food and service. Despite this they do their best to get you in a reasonable time. Food is excellent. My wife is very sensitive to MSG, preservatives etc, so she avoids quite a few restaurants because of this. However she loves coming here since she never has any problems with the food. Service is excellent and food super. Love this place.

Unfortunately the store is a little out of the way for me since I don't often go through Guadalupe. Stopped off and did a little browsing and chatted with Loyola? the new owner. Very friendly lady who gave me a run down on the various local products she stocked.  Ended up with some great cherry butter - tasty salsa from O'doyles and locally made cheese from Gilbert. Also appeared to have a good selection of vegetables and friut and chilis etc. Just a pity they are located a little bit out of the way

Large sports bar with lots of large screen TV's spread around the bar. Has outside patios with misters,  several  pool tables,  long bar and plenty of seating.  I like this place because of the good selection of beers on tap. They even have two of my favorites Boddingtons Ale which is unusual for an American bar and Samuel Adams.  The selection of food is good - plenty of different types of burgers, fish and chips, wings etc. etc.  These guys seem to focus on service always trying to smile, say hi, shake hands etc.  Also has usual happy hour and specials.

Previously the service was pretty good and as I mentioned a good selection of beers, but recently service has dropped off. The guys serving behind the bar are pretty good and attentive, but recently they have hired a few girls who are rather inattentive and don't seem to care. More interested in chatting with the guys behind the bar....  12/1/13  - service is still atrocious, but funny how one gets used to it.    So I walked in last week and thought I would see if it's as bad as ever.  Sat at the counter across from the bar as usual for approx 10 mins with the odd server walking past me without asking if I needed anything. So I do my usual and walk over and ask the bar man for a pint. Oh oh well they are not selling Boddingtons anymore - so that's a real downer. Never mind I ask for a Sam Adams and take it back to my seat, The barman says he will send a waiter over to take my food order. No one comes over of course so after another approx 10 mins I walk over and ask one of the waitresses for some fish and chips. Well I finish up my pint and fish and chips and ask for the bill. So the bill comes, but it's approx 2 x what it should be. I must say the server was very sweet, but very new and had obviously been doing this only for a few days. I wouldn't blame the server, but the totally useless management. How difficult can it be to ensure that you assign servers to each set of seats ; so that customers aren't having to hunt down waitresses?  That reminds me - I better check my credit card to see if they backed out the double charge....

I use La Fitness esp. for the various Aerobics / Yoga / Zumba classes.  1st thing. -  If you take the time to find out who the best teachers are this turns out to be tremendous value.  I use Trena / Teresa for yoga, Scheyla for Zumba, Melanie / Nancey fro Step, Trena for bodyworks, Jenna for club boxing and there are many more good teachers out there. There are also some poor teachers - like I said just takes a little time to figure it out.   The second thing is that there are so many LaFitness clubs around - it doesn't take much time to get a summary of of the schedules on line for all the clubs and figure out a good routine e.g.  Melanie Sat morning step tempe, Scheyla Monday / Friday Zumba Stapley and dobson, Trena sat morn Yoga Dobson, Teresa Sunday morning Yoga, etc. etc.  The third thing is to wait and execute on the special deals. e.g. sometimes at Xmas or New Year they have the buy 2 years get the third free plus keep the same rate...  Some of the gyms have gotten a little scruffy, but over time they upgrade all the gyms - and generally kept reasonably clean despite the heavy traffic..  When you consider you can pay over $10 for one yoga class on the outside - works out at great value in my mind...

I have to give this 5 stars.  This is a great little place - the service is always excellent, (friendly, quick and helpful). The owner is often to be seen walking around and chatting to his clients and can explain a lot about the dishes. The ambiance is very nice with a good "fung shui" about it. The fish in the waterfall and pool at the entrance are gettingquite big now.  Tonite we had a starter veggie garden rolls,  1 x veggie noodle soup, 1 x spicey shrimp dish with rice and 2 x tiger beers for approx  $29. The owner threw in a free Tiger beer since we told him we hadn't seen the coupons in the Az Republic.... I took the shrimp dish with a level 5 spice - so it had me sweating a bit. My wife on the other hand likes her dishes very mild - and they are always able to suit her taste.  My wife has a sensitive tum to msg and such things and so has difficuly eating at some chinese or asian  restaurants without getting stomach-aches. However she never has a problem here and she loves the veggie noodle soup. The bowl is rather large so she never gets thru it all.  The veggies they use are all very fresh and the flavors are great.   We have been to this place at least once a month for the last 6 - 9 months and the service and food quality have remained excellent.  highly recommended

Realy was quite disappointed, Had travelled up from Tempe to watch a movie with my wife at camelview 5 and so looked up the reviews and chose this place. Business must be slow - since we were the only customers on a Friday night other than a couple of pickups.  The 3 folks behind the counter begged us to come in with their eyes.  Large slices of pizza which had been pre-cooked were on display. Chose one each and they were rerun though their reheat oven.  We took our seats outside on the sidewalk at a large and very unstable plastic table. I have to give these guys a star cos it didnt take long for them to run through the reheat oven.  They shouted at us to come and pickup the pizzas after they had been reheated, In my stupidity I had assumed they might bring the slices out to us - esp. with 3 idle folks behind the counter. They had asked me if I wanted a drink, but unfortunately they didnt have a beer or wine license and didnt feel like paying several dollars for bottles of water.  Pizza was rather heavy, greasy and kinda soggy. Initially my wife had wondered if hers had been deep fried cos it was so soggy and greasy. I told her not to be silly - that happens only in the UK. Finally we finished up our pizzas and I stuffed the used plates and plastic ware into the overflowing garbage can outside.  Nostaligia is the word - I was taken back to the world of my youth spent in the UK eating greasy deep fried pizzas served by grumpy old Italians.... :-) I really could have kicked myself for having chosen such a lousy establishment when there are so many other good places to eat in down-town Scottsdale.  We wandered off down the street peering into shop after shop that were filled with cowboy hats and indian jewellery. You have to wonder how they all survive.

04/29/1  Updated review 5 stars Well we have had the doors for well over year and I must say it's been one of our better investments. Other than the initial problems with the locks, they have held up well and look great. It's a pity we didn't have them installed years earlier. We can safely lock the 2 outside doors and leave our main front and back doors open all night to let a through breeze. It's great.    12/1/13 update review (4 x star) Locks seem to be holding up well and very happy with the doors otherwise.  11/7/13 updated review (3 x star): First Impressions finally did the right thing and sent out a more experienced technician. Both locks repaired without fuss. I guess the first technician they sent was very weak and gave me the run around with some ridiculous stories. I must admit I do like the quality of the doors and install was good. So not sure whether or not I should over-look this hiccup in service. upgraded from 1 x star to 3 stars. If the locks hold up i will move up to 4 stars   Initial Review: (1 x star): Nice doors and good initial install. However, we have had a lot of problems with the locks. Key wouldn't come out when fully turned. We had the service guy come out and he said he couldn't replace the lock until it fully fails!!!  We have to go through all kinds of contortions to get the keys out - it seems it has to be aligned up and down correctly before you withdraw the key. Now the front door is doing the same thing.  That's just totally ridiculous... and incredibly frustrating. The doors are only approx less than a year old.  If I had read all the bad reviews I see on Yelp about this company  - I should have gone elsewhere - stupid me for not looking first.....

Had them detail my sons truck. Was in very bad shape plus previous owner had been a smoker. 2 guys came around on time and worked for several hours to clean up the truck. They were very upfront about several large black stains they thought they might not be able to remove. As it turned out they were able  remove most of the dirt and stains and trucks looks much much better.   Very friendly, hard working guys and great communications.  All around great job.  I will have them around to work on our other vehicles as they need it.

Well I have been looking through all my reviews and thinking to my self I need to be more critical and give more 2,3 or 4 star reviews and give less 5 star reviews. Of course I could counter that by saying that I usually only write a Yelp review if I have been really happy with a place or really unhappy.   Well to cut a long story short I will have to award this place 5 stars for exceptional service and support both to the customers and community despite my desire to be more critical.          It's interesting that this shop has been kitty corner / 5 mins from my house for many years, but I had never ventured in and I wondered why anyone would want to visit a specialist running store. However I finally ventured in and realize what great service they provide and excellent technical knowledge. They can check your running gait on their special machine, provide insight on to how the various makes of shoe "feel" and work etc. etc. Plus they provide great support to the local runners. I notice them doing presentations to the local running group outside the store with reps from Nike etc. The Reps who come along even let you try out their shoes on the group runs. All organized by the Sole Spots shop. I doubt you would find that at one of the bigger sports stores. i will have to give Kudos to Sean who spent a lot of time going over the technical details of the various shoes and other items I bought.  I compared the price I paid for the Trail shoes I finally selected (Brooks Cascadias) and they compare very favorably (basically he same) with what I found on Amazon. The guys in the store know their stuff ( most of them are runners as well) and give honest information. Overall a super shopping experience.

Excellent dental care.  Great bed-side manner and dental treatment by both the dentist and the technicians, explains treatment well, up-to-date equipment etc. Also billing / front office do a great job in following up and getting correct info. Keep me on my toes by checking the amount of gum recession on each visit and can tell if I'm not flossing regularly...  Light years better than my previous dentists...

Scale of 1-10 Food 9 - good authentic vegetarian fare plus some unusual breads. Service 6 - very friendly but rather slow Atmosphere 8 - clean, but I always prefer  indian restaurants a little dimmer Value 9  They are still a little new and hopefully trying to improve the speed of the service. The quality of the food makes for somewhat haphazard service.  If you go in expecting somewhat slightly slow service and are not in a rush - you will certainly enjoy this restaurant.  8/6/10 update - have been going to this restaurant regularly  for at least the last 8 months. overall have become even more impressed by the variety and selection of dishes. also service has improved with time. I think I have to place this at the top of my favorite restaurants (even above the Delhi Palace which has been our favorite for the last 20 years). Highly recommended

Had quotes from 2 of the better companies on Yelp. Went with these guys since they were a little cheaper.  Overall excellent service, knowledgeable sales,  super install, system running great. I don't think you can go far wrong with these guys. I had previously used Home Depot for my kitchen install which ended up a bit of a disaster. So this time avoided the Costco, Home Depot type solutions.

Meets all the criteria for a great laundry. Clean building inside and out (recently re-modeled I think), friendly and helpful staff, machines all working and not too expensive. $3.50 / wash for the larger 3 load machines. Lots of TV's spread around plus seats.  While I was there the young lady went all around sweeping and cleaning the floor and wiping down surfaces. It's a lot cleaner than my house for sure :-)  Parking seems a little limited for such a big laundromat.  Switched the cable TV channel  in time to catch the Coyotes - Red wings game. Unfortunately the coyotes lost...  11/23/12 Update  Washing machine died last week and it took LG  over a week and 2 visits to get it fixed. So I had to go back and use ECO laundry again for the week. All the same comments still apply - clean and friendly operation - lots of machines. Parking still a little limited.  They do have free WiFi.

my wife was excited to read about this place. surprisingly the place had been open since February, but we had hand't heard of it until this last week. awesome little vegan, raw, healthy food cafe. chatted to the owner for some time - discussed vegan cheese cake recipes  and swooped notes. very knowledgeable lady owner and very friendly staff, nice selection of drinks, snacks and main courses. the salad my wife ordered was rather large and very tasty, but couldn't be finished. I had the rice, black beans, guacamole and mixed veggies bowl - yummy.

Friendly service, very helpful and reliable.  I had a problem with roof rats. They came around blocked all the holes they could find with wire mesh and set bait traps around the house - plus they gave me plenty of advice.  Roof rats have gone from the house and they have been very reliable on their monthly visits.  Highly recommended

super value, great food. Great to be able to do the buffet dinner in the evenings. This has become our new go to Indian Restaurant even though it's a bit of a hike from Tempe over to Gilbert Drive in Mesa.  Friendly service, very consistent food. The layout is a little drab - It looks like they took over some older style western restaurant, but who cares about that - friendly service, a good variety of tasty dishes, great price.  The kolfi is highly addictive. Menu is great for Vegetarian like me.

I have had several massages here now. Not to much to say other than a great reflexology massage - 90 mins for $45. First few times I had a guy give me the massage (can't remember his name). More recently had some massages from Amy. Well she worked very hard and managed to get me to sleep.  They can usually fit me in a fairly short notice so that's good.

The headliner on my 83 280 ZX Datsun  T top was in bad shape. I had looked online for a custom headliner, but they were all kinda pricey and then i would have had to try to figure out how to install. Eventually someone suggested I look on Craigslist and I came across Coversplus based in Chandler.  Took it across and met up with Rex (very friendly and helpful guy). He took the measurements gave me a quote ordered the materials and set me up for the following week. Job was complete withing a day and with excellent  works-manship. Wish I had thought to check on-line at Craigslist earlier rather than  waste 12 months thinking about how I was going to do it myself.  To be honest I felt a little guilty cos he charged me much less than I was expecting.  An honest guy, with honest pricing and great workmanship.

awful service - just plain rude on the two occasions we had to go in. On the first visit they couldn't be bothered to help with a software up-date even though there was over half an hour before closing time. They sent us down to the Chandler mall for the up-date. On the second visit a lot of hassle over a warranty replacement.  I was dead against the ATT and take over, but I'm wondering now...  They should fire the manager of the store for such poor service.  The service at the Chandler Mall center is much better. Any dealings we have had there have been very good.

I guess they must have changed the manager since the service has improved significantly. Went in to add an extra phone to our plan. They couldn'y have been more friendly or attentive.  My wife and son still on the T-Mobile plan.  T-mobile reception is overall seems to be very good. My sons Samsung Note 2 is awesome.

friendly service, but very disorganized. Took them over an hour to serve us our dinner even though they weren't that business. I don't think they had any designated server to look after our table - so it all depended upon one very harried guy remembering to come by every half hour to check if were doing ok. Chili Rellenos was subpar and the special that my wife had (mahi tacos) was over done. The staff were really trying and seemed to care , but totally mis-managed and dis-organized or perhaps understaffed. That was kinda disappointing since the food and service at the Los Dos in mesa used to be pretty good.....

I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap renting 20 chairs would be. Also like to mention that the folks were all very friendly and helpful.  I had a long fun  chat with the ladies in the front office. What a bunch of friendly people. Also the guy in the back was most helpful in loading and loading the chairs. I wondered if my car could fit all the chairs, but it turns out they are all very stack able.  I will definitely be back when I need to rent some party stuff.

Have been there several times now for questions and help both on my road bike and mountain bike. Very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful guys. (a  refreshing change to the other bike store close by me). I would have to give them 4 stars out of 5 since they were a little dis-organized  and forgot to contact me when the bike was ready and also some confusion over finding the bill and paper-work. However the work done on my road bike was well done and again - super friendly.  Also their folks also put on free clinics (check out meetup)  Update 9/7/12  Have upgraded them to 5 stars - despite them being occasionally a little disorganized  they have been super helpful and friendly every-time I have been in.   I live right next door to Landis, but never go there anymore due to the rude arrogant service there.  Global bikes have the right attitude and I enjoy going there.  Update  11/23/2012  Well my son ordered up a ton of parts for a road bike which he was going to build during his 3 week visit and then take it back to Thailand. It was one of these special bikes that can be disassembled, folded and taken on a flight (has special couplings).  Anyways  to cut a long story short - I realized he was never going to get it put together in time and sprung for the dollars for Global to assemble for him. They got it done at short notice with a couple of days to spare. Usual friendly, but slightly dis-organized service.    Also have to give them high marks for the weekly Meetup MTB tour Cale does plus the regular Meetup workshops

I really like these folks. I sent them an email with my problem. The young lady melanie  responded that night and had had the Technician call me the next day to discuss the problem and we setup a window of time for them to visit.. The guy (Jay) who came to visit was very friendly and polite, He even spent some time trying to see if he could get my old Toro sprinkler timer to work, but he ended up with the same symptoms I had seen.  However kudos to them for checking it out to see if the replacement was necessary. Also the guy was very careful not to wake up some sleeping grandkids.. :-) Good price, very friendly and helpful service. will definitely use these folks again. Out of curiosity I checked the Amazon reviews on the Irrigation Timer they had recommended (Raindial-R external) and it gets excellent reviews. Melanie was super friendly the couple of times we chatted.

I went with the $40 express detail.  They ran it through the car-wash - then took it round to the special express detail area. Took them about 35 mins with at one point 3-4 young folks cleaning and polishing throughout my 280ZX. Anyways they did a very thorough job in-side and out and overall  it seemed like very good value. plus the guy there was very friendly.

I had finally decide to get Solar panels installed on my roof.  Since my house was ~ 25 years old, I decided to bite the bullet and have my under felt replaced rather than have to have it repaired and also incur the cost of removing the panel during the work. Received several quotes for my 2800 sq ft single story house and decide to go with VIP services for a couple of reasons. - Good reviews on Angies list plus I had met the owner and Zona at one of trade shows at Maricopa County Fair grounds.  - Very friendly and they also mentioned that they might be able to get some off cut material at a lower rate from their supplier. Anyways went with 90lbs felt and whole house re-felt plus repair of any rotten timbers and repaint.  They also gave me a couple of quote options for thinner felt (significantly cheaper), but wanted to go with something that should out last me....  Job took approx 3-4 days with the odd break for some heavy rain.  They did a very thorough job and left the site very clean. Final cement work was good and any broken tiles were replaced.   Couldn't find any fault and their customer service is excellent - they seem to want to go out of their way to please

This is a big improvement on the Pasand. Decor much improved and tastefully done. plus clean bathrooms.  Have had the buffet lunch several times over the last 6 months. Food has been been consistently very good on our visits with a great selection for vegetarians.  I'd say they are a little on the expensive side for the buffet - so marked them down for that  - otherwise a good choice.  Get's pretty busy after 12 - with a ton of Indian folks coming in for lunch, but they seem to be able to cope ok.  Have not had a chance to try the Dinner menu yet.  11/23/12 Update  Overall the lunch buffet food selection is great. Very tasty - good section of meat and vegetarian options. Probably one of the best Indian buffets around.  Best if you can get there at say 11:30 since buffet can get pretty busy at 12 - though they do seem to handle the people pretty efficiently. I guess it's a good sign that there are so many Indian folks going there for lunch.

Classic "whole in the wall" Filibertos style restaurant.  Very unpretentious and basic style. Located in Guadalupe. Ordered the Chili Rellenos special for lunch. Reasonably priced at ~ $7. I usually only buy the Chili Rellenos dinners -so I can compare all the Mexican restaurants an also because I love this dish. Anyways - rice nice and fluffy,beans tasty and Chili Rellenos very tasty. Also came with a side of salsa and another spicy sauce. I talked to some of the locals who were  eating there and they all seemed very happy with the food. One guy pointed out that he always came on a Wednesdays for the $1 Tacos. Unfortunately I missed the specials signs.  Nice covered area out front plus eating in-side if required.  As Arni said - "I'll be back"

There are quite a few good Italian Restaurants around this area, but often they often have a limited  number dishes for a vegetarians.  I have to give these guys high marks for the variety of creative and  vegetarian dishes. We split a the beet and brussel sprout salad and a pasta prima vera dish both of which were very good. The Tiramisu was very good, but not quite as good as Vincitorios along the road. I have been twice now in the last 2 weeks and on both occasions I was curious to see how organized they were and if there would be any service hiccups in the first week of opening.  Despite being pretty busy on both occasions - the service held up well. Decor is good and eating out on the patio is great, but i would recommend they invest in a misting system for patio before the temps rise any more.  Overall high marks for friendly efficient service, great selection of good food and nice decor. lets hope they keep the high standards up.  11/23/12 Update  Overall still enjoy coming here - wife especially loves the vegetarian options. She usually goes with the beet salad.  Must admit the last 2 times we have been they had got the order wrong  and meals had to be returned and done over again.  Marked them down a little for that. Service is always friendly, food tasty and ambiance good. Let's hope they get the next order correct?  12/1/13 - Quality of the food and service  has definitely gone downhill over the last year. Pity cos it seemed very promising at first.

Friendly helpful folks in the store. Had my mower repaired, serviced cleaned up and completed in a couple of days. All at a very reasonable cost. Old parts kept aside in a bag for me to check out.

Great value and very relaxing. I have been half a dozen times over the last month and had the hour reflexology massage each time. Has always been one of 2 lady therapists (Ivy and a younger lady) - they are very thorough, hard working and seem to know what they are doing.  This is a slightly different style of massage from say Massage Envy -  you start off reclining in a chair / bed and you are massaged with your clothes on (I go along in a loose t-shirt and shorts - which makes it all a little easier). They dip your feet in some colored liquid (herbal tea?) to start with legs arms etc, are massaged while you are reclining in the chair - then you are turned over and receive more traditional massage while you lay on your tum. Most times I have been able to turn up without an appointment, but now I'm callling ahead incase they get too busy.

Called around a few places and eventually narrowed down to a couple of options. Pete from Pacific Mist gave me a rough quote over the phone and then came around a few days later and discussed a few options on layout, pipe color, where the power and water should come from etc.etc.  The rough quote over the phone from Pacific Mist was very similar to that of the other company, but since Pete was based close to where I live and  had an Australian accent - went with him. We went with a powder coated caramel color stainless line (~ 70 feet) to match the house color with ~ 28 nozzles at 24" spacing, a 1000psi enclosed pump plus additional piping. Pete came around the following week with his helper and installed the system. Very friendly and knowledgeable and clean install. The misting system is working fine and cooling down the patio just great.  I,m wondering why i didn't install a high pressure system years ago. I had discussed whether a remote could be used to start the pump, but forgot to request it in the quote. Pete must have remembered my question and included it in the install for free. - so Kudos there Will give another up-date at the end of the summer.

This place is not the closest coffee shop to me, but when I'm near to downtown Chandler we always stop by.  I always go with the Decaf latte - with the special brazilian beans. Really nice - plus pleasant shop and friendly staff.

This veterinary office is clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They offer discounted services and they seem honest with their recommendations.  Another bonus is Dr. Askew is awesome with our pets and has over 20 years of experience.  Other low costs clinics do not compare to this one and I was more impressed with Homeward Bound than with any other full cost clinic I have taken my pets to.
