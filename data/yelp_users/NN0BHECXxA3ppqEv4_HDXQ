My family and I have lived here for almost 3 years now, and we are staying put for a while.   The community is small, but we love that about Miramonte. Most neighbors are very friendly, and the grounds are always kept tidy. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing, offering a fire pit and cabanas. We love swimming as often as we can! The fitness room may be small, but it gives you enough to sweat and burn.   The neighbors, most anyway, are always friendly. Parking is never a problem, in the 3 years we've been there, only twice has our parking spot been taken. When it is, we ask nicely for it to be moved and it gets moved.   Maintenance is incredible, super quick and very friendly. The front office staff is also very friendly and helpful.   We have a small dog and 4 year old, and we love it here. It's the perfect little place for us, and we recommend it to anyone. We do face Hayden road, but noise isn't too bad. In the mornings, you can sometimes here the band at Saguaro high school play, and i'm sure the neighbors facing Pueblo elementary hear the giggles, screams, and running of small kiddos, but other than that we have no complaints!

The food is OK, not great. The Mongolian beef is maybe the only great thing they have, everything else is mediocre. I order it because there aren't many other options in my area and I keep hoping they'll do better.  I am especially disappointed in their delivery times. When I order, they quote me 30-45 minutes, AN HOUR LATER (sometimes MORE)  it finally arrives... COLD. This has happened the last two times I ordered from this place. The food is already bland, then to deliver it cold? AND they don't even apologize.   QWIK Chinese? Ya right. Not even close to "qwick".

I meant to write a review for this place shortly after I dined, but I forgot. However, I did NOT forget how delicious my meal was!   My boss took our office manager and me to Chelsea's Kitchen in April for Admin day and I am now hooked. I had never been before, so I was a bit nervous.   My friend, the office manager, highly recommended the swordfish tacos, but I noticed there was a French Dip option. I am a huge French Dip fan, so I of course chose that and WOW! It was the BEST French Dip I have EVER had (and I've had them at a ton of places)!! The beef was "melt in your mouth" fantastic, the french roll was toasty, the au jus was perfect, and the FRIES! The fries were magical. I loved EVERY bite!   It would have gotten 5 stars, but our service was a bit slow. I remember having to wait a bit to get my water, and refills. As well as the other guests with me.

I've now been here twice, I know that's not a lot, but both times I've been more than satisfied when leaving. We will return as much as possible!  I wrote a review a year ago stating their french dip was the best I've had in Arizona, and that still holds true. Their fries, also, are seriously incredible.  NOW I can say they have the best swordfish tacos I've ever had ANYWHERE! They also have amazing guacamole, and I HATE AVOCADOS. I can't even tell you how much I despise that green, weird tasting vegetable. But, at Chelsea's Kitchen? I almost ate the entire bowl myself. I also ate their pico de gallo, and my major dislike for tomatoes is much higher than it is with avocado. Chelsea's had me eating foods I never thought I would, ever.   My husband ordered their Dixie Pan-Fried Chicken, and he loved that. I tried a bite and thought it was perfect! He said "it's almost as good as my grandma's, and that's saying a lot!"   It was very busy, and being a Saturday night I wasn't surprised, but the service was still very friendly and quick!   I just love this place, it's so delicious and I'm excited to try more and more!

This place was the setting for two of my "firsts". My first fish taco and my first cucumber margarita and I was far from let down! Holy goodness they were so great. My husband and I had a weekend away from the kid so we decided to get some drinks and tacos. I've heard great things but it's always better to try it yourself! The Mahi Mahi taco was FABULOUS and their cucumber margarita is my new favorite, and I'm not usually a margarita fan!  We'll go back, for sure!

I'm not even sure I know how to describe our first experience at Ocean Prime. Everything from the service to the cosmopolitan was perfect. Our server, Sean, was so friendly and fun. The ambiance was relaxing and enjoyable, a nice place to be away from the kiddo.   Describing the food is going to be difficult, because everything was so perfect and enjoyable. Sean said "phenomenal" a few times, and he's right. The food (every bite) was phenomenal!   For our appetizer we ordered the Point Judith Calamari. Cooked perfectly and the flavor profile was sweet and spicy. I loved every bite!   I ordered the blackened swordfish as my entree. It was cooked to perfection and the surrounding flavors were indescribable. My husband ordered the NY strip which was accessorized with roasted garlic and rosemary. It was so tender and cooked to absolute perfection.  We had jalepeno au gratin as our side and THOSE...THOSE were phenomenal. The jalepeno flavor was mild and wonderful. No heat, for those who can't handle it, so I highly recommend it to anyone!   Our dessert was to die for. We ordered the 10 layer carrot cake, and wow. Just wow! Every layer, every crumb, every drizzle of pineapple syrup was exquisite. I think I dreamed about bathing in it. I WOULD bathe in it.   I woke up still full and satisfied. We drove far (not too far) to get there and would over and over again. It was worth every dollar spent and mile driven!

Loved everything about this place. Service was quick and very friendly, the food was TO DIE FOR, prices were very fair, and the ambiance was fun! It's set up cafeteria-style, but that doesn't bother me at all! Order food, get your number, wait for food. Simple, easy, no big deal. It wasn't incredible busy when we got there just before noon, but was "line out the door" as we left. However, There were plenty of open tables around the joint.  I ordered the chicken bacon panini and with every bite, it got better and better! The bread was toasty but soft on the inside, the chicken had great seasoning, the boursin and jack cheese combo was out of this world, and bacon is ..well, bacon.   The hubs ordered the biscuits and gravy, and he practically licked his plate clean.   We will be returning as soon as possible! LOVED it!

We've only been here twice, but both times have been great! The coffee is wonderful, the smoothie was delicious, the banana bread was tasty, and my dog loves the buzzbones!   My Little loves the kiddo corner, too. We'll definitely be returning customers as we are eager to try more items off the menu!

Loved every second! Everyone was friendly.  I went in for an OPI gel manicure and was pretty nervous at first. My nails never hold a (gel) manicure, I've had them done at big name salons, and the second I leave the chair, the manicure is half gone and chipped away. Such a disappointment, because I love manicures, pedicures, etc.   I saw Tessa, who is the best, and LOVE what she did. It's so cute and fun, much like the salon. 20 lounge is very chic and relaxing, it's a great place for a mommy to escape!  4 days later, my nails are still polished and looking fabulous! I can't wait to go back!

I drive here all the way from Central Scottsdale because Bevin is the best! As well as MANY others there, this salon just rocks. I'm always welcomed with smiles and friendly faces, and leave happy and refreshed!

I'm always looking for good Italian place, and Stone and Vine is definitely a GREAT Italian place! I'm excited to go back and try more, because my first time I ordered a salad. Pssh, what?!  Don't get me wrong, it was a VERY delicious salad, but I had my eye on a few other dishes I saw. Pizza, panini, and pasta? Oh my!  I ordered the Harvest salad and loved it, great flavors. Everyone else I dined with enjoyed their meals as well, no complaints! The service was friendly, the food took a long time to arrive, but with a  large party I guess that's to be expected. I loved the ambiance and overall feel of the place. It was fun and had great energy.    Can't wait to return!

The first few visits here, we enjoyed it. The food was always delicious, the service was great, the movie is fun. No complaints, really.  But, just recently, we went for a family date night with our 4 year old and experienced the WORST service we've ever had. Not to mention the pizza was gross.   We were the first to be seated in the theater, and ordered first because we already knew what we wanted. Our first round of drinks, and the popcorn, were out immediately, but 45 minutes later our food was finally delivered. The coconut chicken tenders were fine, they always are, but the BBQ chicken pizza was so ordinary. Is it made fresh? It tasted like a frozen pizza. Not to mention, I asked if it was possible to take the cilantro off and the dude said yes. There was SO MUCH cilantro on my pizza. You know, not everyone likes cilantro :( So we were enjoying the movie, but were all thirsty again, we pushed the button to order drinks, but no one came (20 minutes went by), so we pushed the button again and finally had our drinks to us in 5 minutes. We went through 4 different servers, when usually we only have one.  The entire experience was a drag, the movie was cute, but the service was HORRIBLE. Super slow and unfriendly.

The chips and salsa were tasty, loved the salsa! We ordered the nachos and they were even better! The chips were amazing.   I ordered the braised beef and red chili tamales and L.O.V.E.D. them!!! They were so awesome! As were the pinto beans, and I am NOT a pinto bean fan! They had incredible flavor. My husband ordered three different fish tacos, he said the shrimp one was OK, but the other two he loved! He's a picky eater, too! My daughter is the pickiest of eaters, but she loved the chicken out of her taco. I ate the beans and tortilla and thought, even for being super simple, had a ton of delicious flavor.  The service was slow towards the end, miserably slow, but the servers and the hostess were all super friendly and funny. Loved the ambiance, too. We sat outside and it was great! Kiddos loved running on the grass (as no other patrons were out there at the time).   All in all, it was a nice evening with very tasty food! Loved it, thanks Joyride!

I am so happy that my family and I tried this cute, little place. The service alone was superb, I think we were greeted by just about everyone who was there that night! With the weather being so beautiful, we sat on the patio. It was clean and enjoyable, which is a big deal for me as I'm not a big fan of eating outside!   We started with some beers and garlic knots. The beers were good, but the knots were a bit overdone. Still OK, just not the best. But, that's fine, because it's the pizza that got me hooked!!  My husband ordered the meatball pizza, and I the Diavolo. There. Are. No. Words. That little devil was incredible! The spice, the flavor, the crust! I'm eating the leftovers now, and I'm still so happy. The meatball pizza was also very good! We left satisfied and will return again!

I honestly can't form words to write a review. So, it'll be easy. Service has been awesome, the place is fun, and the food is freaking delish.  The tater tots - get them!!! They're house made and perfect.  The Hot Chick - Pretty awesome!  The Vig Dip (sans mayo) - Amazing!!  The Black Bean Burger - Best I've ever had, seriously.  The Carne Asada on Potato Pancake - There really are NO words. I inhaled it and licked my plate. I want more now, so I'll see you soon :)  The french fries and onion rings are great, too! Also, the jalepeno dip you get with the tater tots is out of this world! The manager brought us more and I put that ish all over my carne asada. My husband loved it too.   So that's that. I'm drooling now :)
