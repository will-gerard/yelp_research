So, clearly the musician's make the night.  Our night was not so hot.   Half of the bad that we caught wasn't worthy of stage time, the other half was.  The horn players were exceptional, the Keyboardist wasn't.  I'll stick to the facility.  The Rhythm Room is a Phoenix, classic on the music scene, or so I'm told.  This was evident when Paul Reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage.  That was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place.  Beyond that, I'm can't really claim that this place is worth the time.  We'll have to try it again to confirm, yet my urge to do so isn't high right now.  The neighborhood is questionable.  The entrance is not obvious, the bar and the service are not inviting.  The music area of the building is excellent.  You sit very close to the band.  The one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setup/teardown between bands.  We waited for an hour between bands.  The Rhythm Room is missing an opportunity here, they need a comedian or something the fill the gap.    Some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements.  Just because it's a known classic doesn't mean that it can't change for the better.  The one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if they're getting good bands, then it makes for a great night.  The annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands.  The musician's interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool.  This makes everyone involved feel like they're in the scene.

So I'm a Dad.  I'm a picky Dad.  I've been to a number of young kids birthday parties in the Phoenix area and they leave a lot to be desired.  I'm not talking about complicated stuff here.   Sure the kids have fun at some organized events, but how about the parents as well?  I'm so tired of the allotted two pizzas to serve 15 kids and adults that I could cry.  Maybe it's because I'm a food guy.  Feed me well and I'll be happy.  I don't know, but what I do know is that Toy Town is the best destination for all your 5 and under kids birthday party needs.    We rented the facility for 2 hours on Sunday.  Cake was arranged through their custom cake maker.  A half sheet of  cake for $50 and it was a well made and delicious cake too.  The good news for me is that I'm still enjoying the leftovers.  Back to Toy Town.  So it's a kids play place basically.  Set up like a small town.  Each little house in the place is a different business.  Police Dept, Pizza place.  Hospital and so on.  We had 20 kids and as many adults at our party.  All the kids enjoyed it, from our 1 year old to the 7 year olds.  The girls were playing dress up with the clothing from the different houses.  There is a small bounce house in the back that everyone liked.  As per their standard party set up, we ordered Dominoes pizza from right next door.  This ensured that everyone got as much food as we needed.  We had a great time.  The kids all played with all of the toys in the place, we all ate pizze and then cake and everyone enjoyed themselves.  the staff here is wonderful.  They work to make sure that everything is smooth for you.  they handled the few things that we didn't think of and the party was a great success.  Many of the mom's were discussing their future partying plans with this facility in mind.    The only thing that they could improve would be their front entry area.  It is a bit crowded and needs to be reworked for smoothness of store entry.  Beyond that, everything is exceptional.  It was very easy for us to arrange this party, everything was handled well, from the place to the cake and the pizza and drinks.   We were very pleased and will be coming back.

SMC is worth the effort.  The staff is helpful and knowledgeable.  Their bikes selection makes this shop a worthwhile stop when in the market for a new ride.  I shop here often because they carry the Specialized brand and I am growing the appreciate Specialized's products.

The staff here is knowledgeable and friendly. The Chiropractor is the best I've found in the area after many attempts. He is able to find the specific pain points and work them out effectively. He employs multiple techniques depending upon your needs.   Typical visits include a consult, 10 minutes on the electro-stym machine, a brief massage of the affected area and a correction.    I highly recommend Dobson Lakes Family Chiropractic.

Thiele's automotive is my mechanic shop of choice.  I found them through  friend's recommendation and have been going there for three years with all of our car service needs.  They are honest clear, they will do the work that needs to be done and in a fashion that will keep you coming back.  When other shops have recommended more work than was needed Thiele's set me straight and explained what really needed to be done and why.  When I go their for oil changes they give the cars a once over as well, and recommend potential future needs as they see it.  I've had brake work, engine work and regular service completed here and will continue to do so.  The only thing I'd change if I owned Thiele's is I'd install an alignment rack. This is a selfish need really as my previous car needed an alignment done right and Thiele's don't have the rack for it. I had to go to three different shops to get it done right.

When it's time for a great dinner out and $ is not a question, we go to The Keg.  Service and food are excellent.   the only thing I would change if I could would be to make it less expensive so I could afford to go there more often.  I can't decide which is better there, the food, or the attractive ladies involved in serving it.  I can tell you that they are not an 'equal opportunity employer" and I appreciate that.    If I could change anything about the restuarant, it would need to be a quieter facility.  However, I'm there for the food, so I tend not to notice the noise.

The price is high for what you get, but I still enjoy a good meal at the Chart House.  I've had several steaks here and have been pleased with all of them. We've thoroughly enjoyed the Chocolate Lava cake as well.  I certainly recommend that.  As others have said, the lake view is a nice touch.  The wait staff could use a little lightening up, and it wouldn't hurt to turn the lights up just a bit.  Who know though, maybe they're trying to target the 'My date's ugly but I want good food' crowd.

Seriously, I'd rather just eat at the Cafeteria at work than at Casey Jone's Grill.  The food is average at best, the service is beyond slow.  The whole restaurant/bar needs to be pressure washed.  I won't be going back.  Nothing about it was worth the time or the money.

Maybe I'm the fool but I still don't see what the any of the talk is about the Salt Cellar.  Mind you, I'm not comparing it to other seafood restaurants in the valley.  I'm comparing it to other seafood restaurants period.    There is nothing about the Salt Cellar that have ever stood out for me, except the price and I don't find this place worth the cost.  I'd go elsewhere.

If you're looking to experience how a car dealership should function and serve customers, go to LeSueur Car Company.  They win on price, service, environment, ease of transaction and overall selection.  These guys understand how to put people first.  Their service is excellent, their prices are better than any other dealership I've visited (and I've compared both new and used cars and trade in values on three different car purchases).  I keep going back to LeSueur Car Company.  These guys get it and I appreciate that.    They have a large inventory of used cars that are in excellent condition.  They can also get you any new car that isn't a dealer exclusive purchase.  We bought a new Honda in 2008 from LeSueur's.  We shopped around on this and LeSueur's car company beat two local Honda dealers straight up on the price of the new Honda and on my trade in.  That made it a very easy decision.  Add in the fact that the actual purchase transaction took less than an hour (from driving the old car into the lot to driving the new car out of the lot) and I'm a netpromoter for LeSueur's Car Company.    If you're looking for a new or used car, stop by LeSueur's Car Company and experience the difference.

This is a great Asian food diner.  We came for lunch.  I had the Hong Kong chicken per staff recommendation.   It has a savory pepper sauce and an array of veggies.   I had it will chicken and it was very good.    Lunch for $7.  Kids meals for $4 to $6.    We will be returning.      Open kitchen.  Friendly staff Fast.  Easy parking.   Lots of locals use them for carry out.

As per the guidance here on Yelp, we found Fez, for a Saturday night dinner.  We enjoyed the experience.  Our seating was immediate (which may have just been a matter of good timing, we got there at 5 pm).  The restaurant has a well designed interior.    Our waitress was friendly.  Welcoming and helpful.  Our service was timely and the food was very good.  The Lemon Caper Talapia was the best dish we had there.  The apricot salmon was good, but not as good as the Lemon Caper Talapia.  The house wine was good and the desserts were definately worth saving room for.  We got the cheese cake and the brownie with ice cream.  I would recommend both.  The brownie is served piping hot with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  We enjoyed Fez and will return.  A few things about Fez that I would change if I owned it...  The music.  Maybe I'm just to picky or something, but dinner and dance music don't go well.  They need to turn it down or change the channel.  The booth seating needs help as well.  The center of the booth padding is too soft, and at the edges you can feel the springs.  Good posture is not promoted in the booths, which I find annoying.  In the decor, there are some plastic panels bordering the booth areas.  They are smoke and light grey and they look good.  The problem is that they are attached by screws and the screw heads look out of place.  The rest of the decor works well together, we just couldn't get past the screws in the plastic.  These are minor infractions, yet since I'm reviewing, I thought I'd share what I found.  The staff at Fez is open and inviting.  They aim to serve.  They are young and urban and friendly.  A nice blend as opposed to some snobbery that you find elsewhere.  This restaurant has every reason for it's crew to stick their noses in the air, yet they are wise enough to forego the attitude.  You will be treated well here.  The prices are typical for what I would call a scene meal.  The portions are not large, which I would normally complain about, yet it allowed me to have dessert, so I won't complain too much.

Inexpensive delicious Italian food in a small and personable restaurant.  We tripped across Miele's in some 'best of' magazine article.  They were right.  This place is not showy, but it sure is right for dinner.  Your fresh bread will be brought out on a plastic dish, and you'll love it.  I also thoroughly enjoy and recommend the Lasagna.  I judge italian restaurants by this dish and Miele's is still the standard by which I rate the others.    If I owned this place the only thing I would do would be to add regular Ice Cream to the dessert menu, but that's the same knock on most italian restaurants.  No real ice cream.

The prices at performance are tough to beat, as for the rest of it, I'd shop elsewhere.  This is a fine bike shop for entry level riders and I'll stop by for some of their deals as I can't find a better price on Clif bar and Shot Blocks when they run specials.    For serious bike purchases, I would certainly look elsewhere.  It is too bad that Landis' service isn't good because their bike line up is considerably more worthy of serious riders/racers.    If you want personable service and high quality products in this area, I would recommend SMC or Curbside.    Performance is worthwhile for their nutition, especially during their deals, and some of their clothing especially helmets.  The shop specials can reward you with an occasional nugget, but beyond that, I'd stay away.

Haru Sushi is worth the time.   The biggest draw is the speed and the price.  You can be eating as fast as you can take a plate off of the conveyor.  We've fed two people regularly for $20 each time and we leave full.  The quality of the sushi is average.  We have always found the service to be very helpful and timely.  We will be returning often.

This is a locally owned shop run by one of the best mechanics in town.  You will not find better bike service anywhere in the valley.  The work is good, the results are clean and the prices are fair.  As others mentioned, this shop is run by the owners and their pride in workmanship really shows through.  Before Curbside arrived, I used to visit multiple shops for parts and service. With Curbside's detail focused delivery, I have found my new bike shop.  Any service work is always thoroughly explained such to the point that I've learned more about how bikes work from the mechanic here than from the three other area shops that I used to visit.  Their pride in workmanship will keep me coming back.

Excellent video game store.  The staff here is always knowledgeable and helpful.  I prefer shopping here as opposed to other retail options in the area just for the knowledge of the staff here.  I have yet to stump them on any questions.  Their game recommendations have been solid and they've helped me save money through deals they run, promotions and product education.  If you need more than just to buy a game, this is the place to go.  Their knowledge of the games and peripherals is excellent and worth tapping into for your benefit.

We've had Alaskan Pride's fish many times and we agree that this is the best quality seafood we've found in the Phoenix area.  We find them at the Ahwatukee Farmer's market.  I recommend the king salmon and the sablefish as well.

Dutchman's Hideout is an addition built within the space available in the Mining Camp Restaurant.  They have a very welcoming atmosphere and a very warm decor.    Their menu is very good and the prices are excellent.  The food is well prepared and worth the trip.  They have their own baking facilities so all of the bread products are fresh.  The dynamite shrimp is an excellent start and I recommend the bread pudding to finish.  Good luck having room for both.  For the meals, I have had the burger, the NY strip and the ribs.  All are on par with any of these that you can get throughout the valley.

This place has the best sushi that I've found in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable and the sushi is excellent.  This sushi shop isn't one of those affected locations where you'll feel like you need to dress up.  The owners are on site often and overall, this is our favorite place to go for sushi.  I HIGHLY recommend the Oh My God roll.  It was named well.  It is my favorite roll anywhere.
