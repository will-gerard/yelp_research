Horrible food. Come here occasionally and about every fourth visit, they go from an acceptable value to absolutely awful.  Tonight was one of those nights.  Had a craving for sirloin, so I ordered that with baked potato and house salad. We already had onion rings and fried pickles the table that were difficult to eat because they were so salty. Got my salad - this was good with bleu cheese dressing. Ate it all, then came the entree. All I asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato. I added black pepper. Was only able to eat a third of it because someone in the kitchen must own stock in Morton's Salt. The skin was worse, since they roll the taters in salt before cooking.   Okay... could they screw up a steak that I asked to be cooked rare? I know they aren't equipped to do black and blue, but rare is hard to mess up. Cooked unevenly, one side of the steak was medium rare, the other was medium well. I think there was some medium pink in the middle. Overall, the meat was lukewarm, temperature-wise. Again, it was me having a little food with my salt.  No one got their steaks cooked correctly. One asked for medium well and got hers bloody. Different cut, or I'd think they mixed the steaks up. She sent gets back. What she got back looked like it might have been thrown in the microwave. It wasn't gone long enough to have been grilled longer.  If not for the usual nice servers, I'd be upset over not giving this place a double zero for stars.  I ate a third of my main plate because of the extra generous portions of salt. This restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds.   To their credit, they took my meal off the tab and offered me something else because they "don't want customers leaving hungry." I wouldn't have left hungry if they could cook better than a five year old left alone in the kitchen. But I'd rather force a crappy fast food burger down my throat than eat anything more from that kitchen tonight. Already on my fourth glass of water, trying to dilute the salt.  The only thing that would have made me happy would have been a future comped meal on a day they had someone cooking who knew what they were doing. Had I taken them up on the offer tonight, I'd not have been able to eat it, no matter how hungry I still was - for all I know, my replacement meal might have been spit in.  Overall, I've had better meals at Golden Corral - and most of us know how bad that can be.  The kids were happy - young people are more salt tolerant, plus their big brownies didn't seem to be loaded with salt.  Sorry, Texas Roadhouse. You'd already lost most of my family and friends. Tonight, even with as tolerant as I am, you finally accomplished losing me, too.  One word summary for those skimming this review: YUCK!

You know, this place is a sweet and sour experience... when Tina is working tables and Denise is behind the bar, service is great and friendly. When Sonya or Misty are working, the demeanor and service drop dramatically... if you're not part of the right clique, you're screwed.  Appetizers are mostly overpriced for what is marginally a neighborhood dive. This isn't Tilted Kilt, but it is priced like it was. The food is usually good, as long as you steer clear of the cheese crisps - Taco Bell across the parking lot does better.  If you're into beer, this isn't the place to go - about the best beer they have in rack is Fat Tire. Mass-market domestic swill rules here. For liquor, Makers Mark is the best bourbon & forget about single malt Scotch whisky - they don't have any. In other words, you're not going to impress anyone with your taste in spirits coming here. This is the kind of place where they think Jack & Crown Royal are premium selections - and they charge premium prices for the privilege of drinking the stuff of alcoholics... I've begged them to bring in some Four Roses or Macallan - nope... mostly rotgut bottles. I guess if I wanted better booze, I could go to a classier place like Buffalo Wild Wings or Native New Yorker (this place is that far down the list.) I think the Hambone might have a better selection of things to imbibe in and that is sad. A far better experience for karaoke fans or hungry folk would be Old Chicago (Alma School & US60) on Sunday evenings with their $2.50 pints of anything in the rack.  Depending on who is behind the bar, you might have to wait an hour for your tab because the servers aren't supposed to be back there tallying up checks and the bartender might have her sights set on some old fart at the bar. Begging to pay your tab isn't fun, if you know what I mean.  By the way - if you pay with plastic, this place charges a surcharge - something that if people complain about will cost them their ability to take plastic - surcharges & service charges are an express no-no with Visa, MasterCard & Amex credit cards. Complain to your card issuer.  Sometimes I wonder why I go back - but the karaoke is fun (Maestro is the only staff member who usually sings - he is a crowd favorite & you'll love him) and some of the people in there are great - customers & staff. Again, not all the staff is competent and, typical of any karaoke bar, some of the singers think they will be discovered any day now.   By the way - some of the five star reviews are from Simpleton's staff - they think the place rocks, or something like that.  If Denise & Tina leave, I'll find somewhere else to hang out - there are much better options in Mesa & elsewhere.

Best HD dealership around - great staff - if you want a bike, ask for Jerry or David. Tell them I sent you. If you want motor clothes, the selection is great and, in typical HD fashion, the girls are terrific. See Tasha or CJ for personal service. In parts, talk to Carlos & the guys.   This store makes you part of the family without the whiny little sister. No complaints.

One of the finest and most caring animal professionals on the planet. Reasonable rates and they listen to your concerns. Dr. Burke should be on your short list of preferred vets.

Worst service out there. There are stories about Comcast, but I can't imagine them being worse than Cox.  Phone agents who know less than even a beginner, but who insist on telling you to do things that are obviously incorrect. They lie to get you off the phone, and have no issue telling you you're at fault for their problems.   Had a service order to move service on the 27th. Got the email confirmation for the move. Self service, no technician needed. Got four confirmation calls, two after I had confirmed everything. The last two swore they knew nothing about the earlier calls, but when they looked, they found the notes and confirmation. But hey, since they had me on the line, they had things to sell me. Right.  Since we were moving, I didn't connect until the 28th. No signal. Call Cox and was told the service was scheduled to move on the 31st. No, was already out of the old house. They offered to provision the order immediately. I was told everything went through and to try connecting. Still nothing. Get transferred to tech support again. This agent then tells me to do a factory reset of the modem, which I objected to, then finally gave in and did a reset. Then this dummy couldn't understand why all the settings were gone in the modem. She sends me to a second level tech. The second level tech assures me he can fix the problem. After an hour, he puts me on hold, then comes back to tell me there is an outage in my area, that as soon as the techs fix that outage, my service would work. I walk next door and find my neighbor still has all his Cox services working. Check the other neighbor and same thing. I call Cox back and it's now too late for anyone to do anything.  The next day, the 29th, I call back and am told everyone I spoke to before missed the line filter supposedly placed in the ped. She'd have to schedule a tech to remove it. So now I'm looking at Monday. I don't hear fromn Cox, so I call them. No tech scheduled, but they'd be happy to schedule me one. Now looking at Tuesday. Again, no confirmation call from Cox, so I call them. I am told the tech assigned my ticket indicated he'd be here by 7:04PM. Such a strange time, but okay... I'll wait. 7:30 and nothing. Call them at 7:45, only to be told the tech needed access to the house and couldn't get it. Odd, because there were three of us here. I was in the garage, door up, working. Wife and daughter were inside. No call, no doorbell, no Cox truck. But wait, they'll reschedule for Wednesday! I call on Wednesday and, again, no tech scheduled. They can't schedule same day, so it'll be Thursday. I told them I'd not be home until 5. They offered 3-5. Their listening skills really leave a lot to be desired. I again stated after 5. Nothing earlier. This rep seemed to think the techs roll over at 5, but I was firm. 5-7PM or they were losing a customer. So 5-7 on Thursday it was to be. Until Thursday at 3:30 when the tech called telling me he'd be to my house in 5 minutes. I called him back only to be told that even though he was still in the neighborhood, I'd have to reschedule.  No credits, no real apologies, no anything. After 25 years of being a Cox customer, I might have to see what other options there are.  Cox Communications really needs to be put out of business. They are worthless, dishonest and overpriced. Their people are so awful at service, they belong begging on street corners.  And, in past experiences, Cox management is worse than their front line.  If you have an alternative, take it. In each call, no matter my frustration, each person tried to sell me phone and TV and home security products. They even had the audacity to try selling me on faster internet service. Unless they can sell me DirecTV and a locally monitored security system, there's no way I'd take anything more that Cox has to offer. They've blown it, the worthless creeps.

You know, I was worried about riding halfway across town from Mesa to go to this restaurant. I am always a bit anxious when it comes to food I haven't tried before - and no one in our group had been to the Rice Paper either.  What we found was a restaurant off 7th St, in an older part of Phoenix, inside a repurposed old house. The decor was charming - the patio was inviting, but we chose to sit inside.  Five of us - we walked in & were immediately greeted & seated. Greg was our server. These folks took the time to explain the menu, how things worked, that they had a full bar & more.  We did the family style routine, which they seem to accommodate rather well. Three siblings, plus my sister's husband & my daughter... needless to say, we have no worry about sharing food.  We ordered most of the huge selection of spring rolls - I just learned tonight that I love spring rolls. Three different kinds of shrimp, pork, veggie, you name it, I think we had it. Greens that looked like they came straight from the garden - the presentation was beautiful. Sauces that were so good, I wanted to take some home. Ordered some bowls of pho - Vietnamese soup, for the uninitiated, but that's okay - they tell you what everything is. The combination, with meatballs, tripe, beef and more was worth the trip all by itself.  For dessert, we had their ginger crème brûlée. Talk about decadent... and perfectly prepared.  Several bottles of wine and a sampled some of their nice selection of  beers in their rack - when we asked if something was good, they brought us a sample, a very nice touch. They have a light cream ale that has me making room in the fridge for another favorite.  But with as delectable as the food was, the service was out of this world. I've eaten at some of the nicer establishments and I was wowed. My brother, who works in some of the nicer restaurants in SoCal, was amazed. Exceptionally attentive without being overbearing - not once were we asked how is everything, timed for when we have mouths full of food.  Be prepared for a surprise is you need to use the facilities - left side is men. Right side is women. Sliding doors into the private areas - but the sinks are in an open, shared area.  We felt welcomed, had a great time and I would not hesitate to go again. And again. And again.  To Greg and the rest of the good people at the Rice Paper, I thank you and cannot recommend you enough.  My only complaint is that it is a drive from the East Valley - but more than worth every mile. Parking is tight, so carpool & bring lots of friends, family - even your enemies... if you bring them here, they can't stay your enemy.

This store is a blast from the past - a time when the owners were on the premises & not a whiff of chain boredom anywhere. It is a convenience store with a lunch counter. Don't mistake it for a fancy bistro with inflated prices.  Tom & Dina serve up wonderful pizza, gyros & sandwiches at a very reasonable price. Their subs will have you wondering why you ever went to the six-letter franchise chain that starts with an S and ends with ubway. Sorry, Jared, but Tom & Dina have you beat, hands down.  One of the best beverage selections awaits you here, whether you're wanting beer, soft drinks or the latest in energy concoctions.   Don't hesitate. Stop in and see Tom & Dina for lunch or dinner. The only downfalls are that they close at 8PM and all day Sunday, but it is a family business. No outsiders work here.  I think I will sneak over there now.

I am so very sad... rolled in here and wanted to cry... alcoholic beverage permit application on the window, which should have been my first clue.   Walked in and ACK! Tom & Dina are gone. Sold out. New owners. Not the same. No more clean, friendly or inviting. Just another drab store now. The neighborhood lost a treasure and good people.   Onward & upward to find another good place to haunt... this is no longer it.

On a good night, this place is barely acceptable. Too bad the good nights are few & far between.   Their happy hour features the tried & oh, so boring half-price appetizers & buck off most drinks. The problem is, the drinks are a bit overpriced to start with. Tuesday is probably the bright spot, with dollar street tacos - but they aren't worth much more than a buck.  It is a very nice venue, with a lot of potential, It is reminiscent of some yuppie-type patio club in Scottsdale. The patio is large & smoking is permitted - even cigars, which they also sell.   So what brings it down to a single star? The service is HORRIBLE.  After zero acknowledgement for as much as 30 minutes...  Very attractive server: Okay, I can take your order now.  Me: I will take a...  Very attractive server: Oops, I am so sorry - I will be right back.  10 minutes later... the scene repeats.  Nearly an hour after arrival, you MIGHT get a drink. Trying to get the check, especially an accurate one, in less than 30 minutes, is nearly impossible.  Bike night on Tuesday is even worse. But bikers don't tolerate sad service, so Tuesday is a dying night at Mad Dog Saloon.  They usually have plenty of staff  wandering around. But that seems to be what they do best - wandering.  I wonder how long before this place has yet another name change.  Save yourself the headache. To the north is RT O'Sullivan's. Nothing to write home about, but at least the service won't drive you to tears. To the south is downtown Gilbert, with several venues, including Liberty Market & Champions Sports Bar - all with vastly better service.
