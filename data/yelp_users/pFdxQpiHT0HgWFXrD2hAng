We got a flat tire and other places were saying super long waits.  We tried this shop and we were done in an hour plus they didn't charge us for the tire repair!  Staff was friendly and the place was clean.  We will definitely be returning!

Amazing selection with prices and products to fit everyone's needs and budgets. The staff is extra friendly and their at home delivery service is great! One price and you can fill the truck- this was exactly what we needed after moving with only put Honda fit!  Plus you cannot beat some Swedish meatballs!  Make sure you visit on free food day!

We've only been here once and no complaints!  Our waitress was very friendly for our dinner visit. We both order entrees and had enough left over for lunch! You cannot beat amazing meals for under $20 total! Their salsas are incredible as well!

I understand you can only get so much out of a group of 15 year olds working the establishment but you need an adult there!  While they could be cleaning and assisting other customers they continued to giggle and ignore the order screens.  The custard was reasonably priced but the taste was not worth it.

Amazing staff and unique flavors! The portions were just right as well. We both enjoyed our ice cream treats on the patio and the line kept growing outside the door. The line moved shockingly fast and the staff did not seem to care about all the customers.  I cannot wait to try more flavors!
