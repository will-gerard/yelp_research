Met up with an SPJ group for networking event. The outdoor ambience was relaxing and just set apart enough for our group. Mini deli sandwiches were prepared for us, and we all ordered drinks from the supremely affable bartender. There's probably 100 different types of beers/wines here...I didn't have time to browse all the gourmet groceries...it was an ideal marriage of tasty food and atmosphere this last day of April. I guess I'll go inside next time I'm here; it's about to get so hot! Edit: they tell me they have misters too, and not just the masculine variety. ;)

Happened upon this little dive and had a dinner of sliders, brats, fries and a chocolate milkshake I won't soon forget. Authentic and filling, it doesn't get much better than that. Such good, old-fashioned American food. You won't be disappointed if you eat here. The decor is fabulously retro, paying homage to Chicago sports teams of years past. The service is straightforward but attentive.

Mi Patio catering was food at a recent party I went to in Phoenix. Mostly great Mexican food, with a hint of Greek food thrown in (I was told there was a family connection). Hence, delicious fajita filling AND guilt-inducing spanakopita (edit: more like spinach-filled egg rolls, to be precise). I prolly won't make it to Phoenix Friday tonight, but it'll be worth going!

The stars in my review are based on tasting just one dish of jamón, which was serrano--not jabugo as I ordered. (If you know something about jamón, it's impossible to pass off the inferior product for the sublime jabugo). Yet I was charged as if it were de bellota. Other reviewers have written their take on other dishes.  It's hard not to be tough on an expatriate Spanish restaurant after you've lived in Spain for a good chunk of time (more than a year in my case). If not for my flamenco dancing colleague, I doubt I would have sought out Pepin's. Her flamenco was good and if you go just for that, you should have a good time. I ducked out before the salsa dancing started. (It seems obvious to me that they rely on dances to attract the night crowd and make up for low numbers during the day).

Granted, this restaurant has been my sole exposure to Ethiopian food, but it is _so_ good. For around $15-19 you can get an _enormous_ tray full of 10 or so different veggie and lamb/beef dishes,  all on a bed of sour injeera bread. Great for sharing between 4-5 people, with extra bread on the side. As long as your dining company doesn't mind eating "with their hands," you'll have a delicious, fun meal. Good thirst-quenching drinks too. Last time I was there, I wanted to try their "voted best in the valley" tiramisu for dessert, but they were out. :( Attentive service, still.

Sub-par products (oversweet chai made from powder), inattentive staff (3 minutes for you to acknowledge me standing here?) and dirty environs (flies and split foam cushions). Errr, as much as I am a fan of local coffeeshops, this place doesn't make the grade. I've heard it was better in the past. But I don't see much hope for their future.

-Irish pub atmosphere (that's what you were expecting, right?). -Patio for when you need some fresh air. -Occasional live folk music. -Decadent bread pudding: totally worth it no matter what you're drinking.

The food's not anything spectacular, but the setting is one-of-a-kind Old Western. This is supposedly the oldest building in Tempe and it's just a maze of saloon-looking rooms. In case you were thrown off by the "la casa vieja" tagline, like me, you should not expect Mexican food. Decent onion rings and fried zucchini starters and lunch sandwiches. Stellar peach cobbler "for 2" for dessert. Always-filled water glasses.

No regard for customer service, but hey, they had what I needed--old-school PC-TV converter. They seem to live by the motto, if we stock it, they will come. An overwhelming store to try to navigate, and no product help from employees (who are all male, it seems, and attired like Mormon missionaries who don't know what an iron is). If you have any patience, go to the Internet. If not, go to Fry's (for as long as they survive?).

After a particularly insulting customer service experience across the street at Eyeglass World, where my eye exam was completed, I came to Sears Optical with my Rx in hand. As it happened, it was around 7 p.m. and it looked like they were closing up (there were already dividers blocking off the waiting area from the hall.  Nonetheless, the two workers invited me to come in and browse at my leisure. They actively offered information about the frames and brought out a selection that they had already put in storage for the night. From that bunch I selected a pair that I really liked and we sat down to finalize the purchase. Since I was getting sunglasses, they had me test out polarized vs. nonpolarized lenses and showed me the two color options. Throughout it, the attitude of the employee was extremely helpful and full of service. At the end, she took an imprint of my credit card, since they had already locked up the register, and promised to send in the order by phone as soon as they opened the next day (at 10).   Possible cons: their selection isn't enormous and they may not have what you're looking for, but all the ones they have are moderately priced. When you look for frames you usually have to shop around a bit. Also, depending on your insurance, you may have to page a good chunk for now-normal lens finishes, but c'est la vie.

Upside: nice-looking contemporary space, great drinks and pastries, reasonable prices, not Starbucks, healthy buzz of conversation, free Wi-Fi  Downside: very hard to tell what it is from the outside and get there accurately for first-timers. (If coming from north on Central, you'll flip a U at Campbell after light rail station, then) turn right on Turney for parking lot.

What a grimy little corner of Mill. I was with a dinner party of graduates and we were dressed formally...whoever chose to come here after Rula Bula must not have anticipated the constant stream of questioners grunting, "hey, why you dressed like that? wedding?"  The topper was being offered a shot by a group of 18-year-old boys to help them out. Sorry, I'll stay here with my husband and soberly contemplate the awful logo and--what's that there?--a pole with exposed nails fallen off from a wooden bench. If you dare come here, be sure your tetanus is up to date.

What they do well here are "frost" drinks (with ultracrushed ice, a la frappucino). Competent baristas and quick service. 3 hours of free wi-fi with a drink (requires a password but I'm not sure if you can get one without purchase). Outdoor seating is pleasant and cool, with shade and fountains. (P.S. Bring headphones, unless you love your '80's music. It can get noisy.)

Tasty pumpkin shrimp curry, but I didn't like their pad thai that much.  Big fan of everything they fry, and I'm not usually so much for fried food. Their wontons and fried banana dessert with coconut ice cream were crunchy and perfectly formed. Drinks were also great. Prompt service and good prices.

The stock of cupcake flavors seemed to be running low when I popped in, (not surprising since it was half an hour before closing). DON'T PANIC. The lovely cupcake girls announced that while they might not be visible in the display case, at least 10 varieties (those on the board with a dot by them) were back in the kitchen and could easily be frosted if any of us customers so desired. Cupcake crisis averted.  But the best part about my visit was getting a free red velvet cupcake for mentioning the Twitter secret code: "sugar rush." Follow http://twitter.com/sprinklescupcks and you'll be in the know too for their next freebie.  Oh, did I mention they also have the cutest website? And seasonal flavors too, including for Passover, Cinco de Mayo and Mother's Day this month. I'm headed up this weekend for some Key Lime perfection.

I waited about 40 minutes for my appointment with the optometrist, thought I had an appointment. The exam itself was fine, though there was a lot of disorganization apparent through several staff interactions I observed.  Afterward, I was browsing frames and had questions about the cost, but the staff told me, verbatim, "It's not worth calling your insurance to get the exact pricing until you're sure you want to purchase them. It's a hassle to call back then if you decide then you're not getting them." They weren't sure whether or not I could be eligible for their 2-for-1 promotion in addition to my insurance benefit, and couldn't seem bothered to find out.  I think the kicker was when I asked about their hours they explicitly said they were really busy Sundays but there was only one employee then, so don't come. I wondered, if you know you get a lot of customers at a certain time, wouldn't it make sense to staff appropriately?  Thanks, but I'll take my money elsewhere. I'm going to shop around, and if you can't accommodate that, you won't get my business. Don't go here.

NOTE: signs at the restaurant indicate they are only open for dinner right now.  Great, all-round experience. Ducked in out of the rain and we were famished. The bistro's carefully prepared food and fast, unobtrusive service did not disappoint. We were first brought some parmesan, chive and truffle-oil garnished popcorn. We ordered an escargot starter (heavy on garlic, but we loved it), the butternut squash gnocchi (fresh gnocchi, though not a very pronounced squash flavor) and the excellent, cheap burger (fabulous complements with the caramelized onion and sun-dried tomato). But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the warm Affogato bread pudding with gelato we had for dessert. Probably one of the best desserts of my life.  Great lighting and use of space. The decor is warmly colored modern with an emphasis on the bottle storage covering every wall.  I'd love to check them out again, now that I know about some of their weeknight specials.

The food here is scrumptious, with an emphasis on seafood, south-of-the-border spiciness and some special touches from the chef. I highly recommend the green chile lobster dip as an appetizer--truly my favorite dip ever (the fresh fried flour tortilla chips don't hurt.) From there, it doesn't seem you can go wrong. Plenty of entrées to choose from, running the gamut from burgers to enchiladas to various fish. A couple of veg options. The green salsa is pitch-perfect. There are specials on the board when you walk in. I've always finished just full enough to not want dessert (though I could say I perpetually want sopapillas) but not needing to take home leftovers.  From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very promising, with its shabby exterior, location next to a paint-ball club on a ghetto stretch of Country Club Road (though which part of this road isn't ghetto?). Inside, the ambiance changes to comfortable, well-lit and nicely decorated. Enter and it will be worth your while. (Only caution is to open both left and right taps at bathroom sink or risk getting scalded)  I've gone to this location twice and haven't ever had trouble getting seating for two. Likewise I've enjoyed good service. It seems there have been multiple reservation fiascos because they haven't figured out how to handle larger crowds, which is a pity. I have yet to try their Scottsdale location but will report on it soon.

Drive-thru coffee, smoothies and more! I'm obsessed with the Dutch Freeze (frequent buyer card, woot!) This drive-thru drink experience is always a pleasant one because the barista boys are always smiling. And you can't this: Free drinks today, Friday 7-17, a new location is opening (http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2009/07/free_dutch_bros_coffee_at_temp.php) at Mill and Southern.

Cute retro market with local/healthy/organic products and a coffee bar. Fans, bar counter and bathrooms all have fun design details. There's also a demo area where takeaway meals are prepared (this wasn't totally up and running when I stopped in mid-April).  This place is starting out, with a soft opening just 3 weeks before I saw it. In the next month there should be some grand opening activities.

This is a new place on Mill, and I'm so glad to see it come to the area (otherwise in serious contraction mode). We ate during their grand opening weekend, and were lucky to benefit from several promotions, including 2-for-1 entrées. (Maybe they were buying me off so I'd write a good review. It's working, it's working--http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hsno7niC_4)  We sat at the bar at around 7 p.m. and received friendly and attentive service there. It was moderately busy, but I expect things will pick up soon as word gets around.  We started off with the gorgonzola and bacon garlic fries, which are huge and heavy...not quite my thing but tasty and probably great for sharing with more people. Then for the entrées. I had spectacular scallops, cooked just to the point where you could slice them like butter. They were served with some flavorful Israeli-style couscous. My husband had the new york strip steak with the most perfectly complementing potatoes I've ever had. The flavor of the potatoes--some divine balsamic reduction, I think--was over the moon.  We didn't have any room for dessert. Next time, I would love to try their salads. And the fact that they feature a different U.S. regional cuisine each month is something to look forward to. I will come back. (To quote the hotels.com commercial again, "oh, they got me.")  Unfortunately for Regions, they are right next to Churchill Cigars (gag me!) If cigar smoke could ruin your meal, avoid the bar and outdoor tables. Next time we'll find an interior table.

Note: they cut back on hours and now are ONLY open lunch 11 a.m.-1 p.m. M-F. Closed during semester breaks, they're opening up next on June 1.   Not at all what you'd expect from on-campus dining, this space features sustainability in its construction, practices and menu offerings. The way it works is you get a assigned a table number, then you browse the food prepared that day at the various stations--pizza, entrées, sandwiches, etc.--and finally you order at the register.  Since you order first and tips aren't really part of the set-up, you won't get super personal service. But the food is really fresh and healthy/yummy and you'll feel good knowing they're making a conscious effort to not be wasteful. This past semester's menu featured sustainably harvested desert sweet shrimp and locally harvest citrus and dates. Good value for your price, ranging from $6-$20 depending on ingredients. Your meal purchase includes any drink; I recommend the prickly pear iced tea.

This is the best Mexican market I've been to in Arizona. It's enormous...like a Costco decorated with colorful hand-painted wooden signs everywhere you turn. Unfortunately, like Costco, it can also be packed. Granted, this location is new and attracting a crowd with some of its specials, but I have a feeling that the number of customers won't wane too much any time soon. Not only are the prices super-competetive for any and every Mexican food product you could desire, there's a fabulous fresh foods section. This includes a juice stand, a yogurt stand, a salsa bar, a carnitas/pollo rostizado/costillas section, a guisados and platos combinatos line, tacos and of course freshly made warm tortillas. Plus outdoor grilling. Pretty much like Mexico, except cleaner and they accept credit cards for anything. :) It's heavenly.

This is a brand-new Indian restaurant specializing in grilled food. It's funny because there's a lot of Mexican painted ceramic tile around the windows and bathroom, remnants of investments from the previous (failed) owners.  The grill's portions are very generous for a reasonable cost, $8.95-$12.95 for entrées. If you want it hot and spicy, they are happy to oblige. Great breads and sauces and not too long prep times. Yes, they are new and working out some kinks in the service, but I definitely see a lot of potential here.
