Delicious gyros, always made to order & wrap style (instead of pita) is the best! We eat here often and have always had excellent service.

Very delicious burgers, onion rings, and chicken strips. Shakes and malts are very tasty! Always made to order. Very kind customer service. Personally, I like it better than Smash Burger.

Honestly the BEST pizza and wings in the valley! Have tried almost everything on the menu and love it all.  Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's. Highly recommend Santisi!

I don't like to give negative reviews but my husband ordered chicken and it was undercooked...TWICE! Service was good and they apologized but raw chicken to me is a major mishap. Upon leaving we noticed sewage seeping up from the drain outside and notified them about this unsanitary issue. Unfortunately, our visit there consisted of a combination of bad events.   We have not returned here to eat and I do not recommend it.

Amazing happy hour and lunch menu! Good for date nights, groups, or families. Sushi is always fresh and tastes great! Drink deals are a plus with delicious green tea ice cream to end the visit. I highly recommend Yen Sushi!

Always great good, drinks, and service! Chic and relaxing atmosphere and always clean. The kitchen was behind on our last visit and our food took longer than usual, but the manager paid for it and apologized.

All around amazing! Service was great, appetizer fondue melts with deliciousness, salads were good, salmon very fresh, ravioli tasty, and dessert like silk. I saw a review before going that stated the food was "bland". Personally bland was not at all the case! The fondue that I got was gorgonzola and bacon both are very rich in flavor. They seem to use a lot of garlic as well. With the dinner entrees we were given 5 boats of various sauces and a garlic/wine seasoning. If you use what is given the food was far from bland. The atmosphere is romantic and private. I highly recommend this place.

Beautifully located in Scottsdale Quarters. Great for a mom lunch right by the splash pad or date nights. Food and drinks were amazing. Relaxing outside dining and service always very personable.   Have ordered sandwiches, pizza, and spaghetti squash. All entrees were delicious and the best part HEALTHY! Kids menu had a good selection but portions are limited. Highly recommend True Food especially for gluten free eaters.
