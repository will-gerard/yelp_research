Meh. Mediocre at best. Service was horrible. It took 20 min to get drinks and then we were asked if we would like to order appetizers.  I may have enjoyed the food but I was turned off by the service.

Awesome barbeque in meager settings. The focus in this joint is definitely the meat. Dont expect any fancy drinks just great BQ

I'll give this place 2 stars for the atmosphere and service. I went there with my girlfriend and split a Chicago dog, lentil soup and side of mac and cheese. The hot dog looked amazing but failed to perform. We were suspicious that it was precooked because of how quick we received our order. The lentils were unfortunate looking and tasted worse then their appearance and the macaroni was pale bland pile of mush uncleverly disguised by a meager layer of panko bread crumbs.

Finally a worthy sushi bar has landed in tempe. If your smart you will sit at the bar and chat up the chef.

Ive never been a huge fan of indian food. This place may have changed my mind. Dont be fooled by the location its alot nicer on the inside then it appears from the parking lot. The staff was really nice and the pricing was very reasonable. 4 entrees and 2 appetizers for 40 bucks. Ill be back for sure.

Father and son operation. Howard comes out does the estimate and his son does the work. In my case very quick the next morning. Howard was super knowledgeable and very honest. I know who I'm calling if I'm ever in need.
