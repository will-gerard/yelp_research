A third party booked this room for me for 3 nights. When I first walked into the room, I could barely breathe it was so smoky/musky. I entered further into the room, and there were urine stains on the sheets and carpet! I told my husband that we would find someplace else to go for the night, because I was legitimately concerned that I might catch an STD or something from being there a minute longer.

I had been planning to keep my iPhone 5s forever, because I hate change that much, but in less than 24 hours, the home button stopped working, subsequently the microphone malfunctioned. I went to Verizon indecisive about what phone I would get next. Dave approached my husband and I, and discussed the pros and cons of each new iPhone out. Let me tell you, this man had the patience of a saint because like I said, I'm indecisive. He took his time, and I never felt rushed. He was very knowledgeable about technology and the company. We felt very comfortable around him and his great personality. He is definitely an asset to the Verizon team. We will definitely be returning to this location.

I have always loved the pizza here. McGregor hears about my less than satisfactory experience at another location, and took it upon himself to take care of us completely. I was overwhelmed with gratitude to his willingness to make our experience over the top awesome! Thanks McGregor!

Dr. Cabey was my pediatrician for years. Because of her, I pursued a career in medicine as a PA. She is one of a kind!

This is not a 5 star hotel luxury wise. I am giving it 5 stars for what you get for the price. Sunset is clean, fun, and has excellent prices. From bowling alleys to a movie theatre to slots, you can't go wrong staying here!  UPDATE: In November of 2015, we had some difficult issues regarding some of the staff. We were so upset about it, I called downstairs to speak with a manager. Within a few minutes, I was transferred to James Ouano (hotel manager), and I felt he did so much to correct the situation. I am very grateful he not only resolved the issue, but even went out of his way, to type a card to us, apologizing on behalf of some staff's behavior. I understand not every company is perfect, but good managers are truly an asset when these issues arise. Thanks James!

I love Dr. P! I loved her so much, we drive to Nevada from AZ for my dog's appointments. I was so sad to hear that she just moved to Connecticut though. After talking with one of their receptionists (Robbie? Who was so nice) let me know that Dr. Rose would be a great alternative to Dr. P. I will be trying Dr. Rose out later this year for my dog's dental cleaning, and update my review on my experience with a different vet then!

This is the best breakfast I have ever had! The only downside is the wait to be seated. Don't let the wait scare you though. The food is well worth the wait! I've only been here once, but it will definitely not be my last!

They may offer quantity... But not quality. Not worth the money.

UPDATED REVIEW: 3/20/14  Initially, I had given this place a 5 star rating. However, due to a recent discovery, I am no longer recommending them. I noticed food items missing from the room's fridge (brand new, unopened sushi) , and asked the front desk why the maids had threw away my unopened, untouched in a sealed box of sushi away. They didn't have an explaination, except that they thought that since I wasn't in the room, that I must want my food items in MY FRIDGE thrown away. As a broke medical student, I was really frustrated that my expensive sushi was just thrown away. I called the manager two weeks later and explained to them what happened. He basically  said that he would talk to the other manager, and get back to me. That never happened.   I know this is only sushi... but it made me think... what else are these maids going through? Why go through my fridge even?   I am very cautious with my luggage, and always make sure to seal my personal belongings inside the case.  So, even if you think you store things carefully away, apparently this does not stop them from rummaging through your stuff.   Cons: The rooms are made for ants (aka: super small) Pros: It was clean

As an egg donor, I have worked with Dr. Patel on four different cycles. However, not even the compensation motivates me to ever donate again-- due to my experience here. Not only does my experience leave a sour taste, but medical records were released without verbal or written authorization. Karen and Anne continually fail to return my emails and calls regarding why they were released!! During my donation, I had many complications, and Dr. Patel didn't even flinch or at least act like he cared. He definitely sees his patients as more of a paycheck than an actual person.  I definitely do not recommend.

I love Jamba Juice... Just not this one on Power Road. I've given the place three tries after they completely botched my order the first time. They never get it right. Plus, the staff here was always super rude.

I absolutely love this location. I will always see Emma or Suzanne. They were so helpful when I told them I was clueless about decorating my house! So glad for employees like them who are passionate about their job and give excellent customer service!

Be prepared to be overcharged. In addition to paying an arm and a leg for a breakfast burrito, I also had to deal with one of rudest staff members that works there! I would have kept paying their outrageous prices (I am a fan of supporting local businesses), but after being so rudely mistreated by their main staff member, I have not and will not visit again! I would also discourage others from going there, until Mangos rethinks their prices.. and hires new and friendlier (English-speaking) staff!

Best sushi for the best price! My recommendation is to get the all you can eat Buffett. My favorite roll are the rattlesnake and my husband's is the hot tamale. Hands down, rattlesnake is the best!   I took off one star because the service is a hit or miss.

I gave their carne asada burrito experience a try... Couldn't even finish half of it, because it was so gross.

This review is based on JUST the Superstition Springs location: My favorite kind of pizza is from BJ's. My husband and I usually get half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken as toppings. Other than a Caesar salad and a pazookie, I have not tried anything else... so this review is based on just these foods alone. The pizza is extraordinary and just one slice will make you feel full! We tried the pazookie (ice cream with a cookie) a couple of times here, but I have had better elsewhere. Actually, their pazookie makes me a little sick. Their ice-cream tastes cheap and frothy.   Normally, I would give BJs a 4.5 star review, but because of my most recent experience at the Superstition Springs location, I am going to bring my starred review a couple notches. We invited some friends to BJs and advised them they could not go wrong with the pizza! My husband has a fatal allergic reaction to olives, so we always make sure to tell the waiter to NOT put olives on anything he eats. BJs has usually accommodated this request, and I appreciate that. However, I feel that our waitress at Superstition was largely incompetent. Well, I was correct! While we waited for our pizza (which took an hour-- it has never taken an hour, okay?) our water glasses remained empty (for an hour people!) The waitress never came to refill our glasses. We were annoyed by it, and even a little embarrassed that we had raved so much to our good friends we had invited about the restaurant. When our pizza finally came, there were OLIVES on the pizza!

I've been seeing Dr. Herrera and Jenna (PA) for several years, since CCM first opened. Dr: Herrera and Jenna are awesome, but they book out far in advance often. Recently, I saw Kyle (PA) and he was awesome as well. I highly recommend Dr. Herrera, Dr. Smith, Jenna and Kyle. I've seen their other providers, but none made me feel comfortable like the providers I mentioned.

Almost every Friday night, my husband and I order from this Barros location. We typically purchase an extra large pepperoni pizza, which is more than enough. We order the extra large so that we can have left overs for the rest of the week. We love Barros pizza because of its great quality of ingredients. Not only do they provide delicious pizza, it is all at an  affordable price. Tasty AND affordable? I'M THERE!

I was brought up in a Mexican household. I gave Tia Rosas one star because I just wasn't impressed with the food authenticity, and it's lack of flavor. I know a lot of people that love and swear by Tia Rosas, so perhaps it is just because I was brought up with actual authentic Mexican food though.

Do NOT use this company! The owner is horribly rude, and hung up on me after I called to ask about the terrible job that was done to my house. Horrible customer service! I can't believe people like this are allowed to run a company. I uploaded a video on what our personal shampoo vacuum from costco pulled up from the carpet AFTER the poor job that Campbell's Steam Pro did to my carpets! http://youtu.be/8FkRqZcge7M

I lived in Vegas, where I was surrounded by great sushi all the time. When I came back to AZ, I was on a mission to find great sushi again (because Ra has never done it for me). I found my new favorite sushi place here! We will definitely be back!

As a med student, I am constantly under stress and my feet have been paying the price for it. Being a new resident of Nevada, I searched for a place I could get a legit foot massage and a pretty pedicure. I found Kim (thank goodness), after a lot of "hit and misses" elsewhere. She's so good at what she does! I feel like a new person after an hour with her! I will definitely be back!

It was my first time at SMG, and also my last. It was my last because the chairs are SOOO uncomfortable. Sitting in my car is more comfortable than the stiff office chairs you get. Not impressed. I did not try the food, because I figured if it sucked as bad their chairs, it wasn't worth trying.

Francesca's is my new favorite store. It has unique, colorful and well-made items. I have been opting to shop here instead of Forever 21 lately, because the quality of the clothes/accessories seem to be made better here. The only reason I give it 4 stars, and not five, is because tops seem a bit pricey. Great deals on dresses though!

I have had extensions done for over 2 years. Hilaree is by far the best lash artist I have ever seen. As a PA student in Nevada, I am obsessed with lashes because it saves me so much time in the morning-- especially when i have an exam that morning.  So glad I found her :)

Two years ago, the food and prices were fantastic. Fast forward to 2015, the prices have gone from what was $1.25 a taco to $1.89. Yes, I understand it's less than $2, but the size of the taco is super small. The carne asada is what used to draw me in, however, it is now very coarse and dry. Super sad that this place with so much potential has deteriorated into a dirty shack without delicious food. We probably will not return.

I moved back to AZ last year and still can't find a theatre like this here. I miss the comfy recliner chairs and affordable ticket prices. I miss being able to pick out your seat before the movie starts. So convenient!

Whoa, this place was busy! But food was okay, and service was top notch. I had the huevos rancheros which looked better than it tasted (didn't taste bad, but not great either). Only other suggestion would be to turn the music down a tad because I felt like I was yelling to my server and my Guest at the table.

My husband and I discovered HenHouse through a friend a year ago, and we go now more often than our friend does now. The green chili skillet is to die for! Today, I would like to recognize an attentive waiter, Mike. My husband and I noticed how attentive he was, to everyone, including our table. It's so difficult sometimes to find such an attentive waiter, especially during the busy time that we went today. I am in healthcare as a PA, and it is difficult to find attentive staff. When you come across a good employee, it's important to recognize them! Keep up the good work Mike and Henhouse!

My mom and sister visited me at work (I work in the same plaza) and we all had lunch together here. The owner, and his female employee were extremely helpful, thoughtful and kind while my family and I enjoyed their lunch. My mother and sister had a chicken sandwich which they loved. I purchased a loaf of jalapeño/cheese bread which has been awesome! So good! Will be back again!
