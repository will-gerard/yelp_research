This is my least favorite LA fitness location for a number of reasons. For one , the place is always disgustingly dirty.  Every single trash can is overflowing with dirty paper towels, I'm not sure if they don't know how to take a trash out or if their cleaning crew is nonexistent.  The bathrooms are always a mess too, very unsanitary.  Secondly, they don't carry jump ropes/ similar personal training equipment. Isn't this a gym?  Every other LA fitness location caries them, maybe you guys should too.  Every time I come in I feel like the staff is on social hour.  Always conjugating and the one time I had a question they acted like I was interrupting a church sermon on Sunday.  Really poor customer service.    This is the closest location to me, but I avoid going and probably will not be going back unless I have to do to time constraints. Shea and Scottsdale location is amazing- super clean ( I see the cleaning crew working diligently every single time) , friendly staff , and all necessary equipment!

Came here for the first time this morning for breakfast, loved it! Love the vibe inside , very relaxing. I got the Italian frittata, which was tasty.....and huge, I'm writing this at 6pm and I'm still full! And their roasted potatoes, holy delicious, I could have that as my meal alone.

My favorite place to eat, hands down, I come here at least 3x a week. The food, atmosphere, staff, and service is nothing short of amazing! Such a great place to dine out and not have to to worry about finding a healthy option , because everything is healthy and delicious. Their iced tea and lemonade are to die for, and their late riser bowl is everything!
