I have brought my daughter here before with great staff and great care from the doctors. This visit on 1/20/15 has not been pleasant...front check in lady Leece was extremely rude when my mother rushed my daughter into the clinic because she was throwing up and while she was throwing up she had diarrhea everywhere...my mother just laid my daughter down to the nearest place to try to help her and started changing her because she literally had a huge accident.  As I'm walking in I see this and hurry to help my Mom as I was trying to park the car...a lady sitting in the same lobby but on the other side with her son got up and hurried away...which was fine (but honestly who hasn't smelled baby poop before?! Being a mother you would think she would understand the dilemma. The front desk lady Leece then rudely said oh you could have taken her to the bathroom (which DUH my mother was just trying to help my daughter who was also choking on vomit) She then started to make a big deal out of it...kept apologizing to the other lady and kept making comments which is extremely rude and unprofessional. I'm still sitting here and the lady as yet to get some sanitizer to clean the bench or get make sure my daughter is okay. I will be putting in a formal complaint as well to Phoenix children's. RIDICULOUS.

Rays pizza....what can I say other than AMAZING pizza! Everything about rays is delicious.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have always left satisfied! You couldn't ask for a better pizzeria!  Staff is extremely friendly!  If you are looking to satisfy your taste buds then make sure you stop in at Rays. This is a new favorite spot for me!

I saw Dr. John Desalvo for my pregnancy and delivery of my daughter back in August.  He is by far the best obgyn. So kind, takes his time with his patients!  I loved his personality!  The front office staff was nice but his MA is such a sweetheart.  I was always glad to see her she always made me feel super comfortable getting weighed (I hated that part!!) Lol. The delivery of my daughter was such a beautiful experience I wouldn't change that for anything.  My niece who is 15 was in my delivery room because she wants to be an OBGYN and he explained everything so well...she really learned a lot! I LOVE Dr. Desalvo!!
