I would give 4 stars at least but the lady that worked the cash register isn't helpful at all. She was working on 2/21 at noon. Took my car 2 hours to get it cleaned, oil changed and carpets. She acted like I was bothering her by asking how much longer it would be or asking her to make a call. She's pretty rude. I even left and came back and my car still wasn't done. I'll come back here because it's convenient but she isn't very pleasant.

I brought 2 of my girlfriends Pomeranians in to get groomed and nails clipped and from the start it was a bad experience. They didn't have me fill out any info about my dogs, didn't ask if they had shots, and I didn't get a call telling me they were done grooming.  So I call and ask if they were done and then went in in to pick them up and before they would bring my dogs out they asked for me to pay and made sure to ask for a tip!!! I thought that was odd and bad taste but I went ahead and paid plus tip and then they had me fill out paper work.  They finally brought my dogs out and I picked up Koko which is 6 mths old and looked down on my white tshirt and there was blood all over my shirt, a lot of it and it was also on the floor!!!!! They tried to down play it as if this kind of thing happens from clipping her nails and didn't offer anything to make it right!! Not even a dry cleaning bill!!!! Nothing. My poor dog was bleeding all over the place. This is no exaggeration. Do not take your dog to this place if you care about them.   Jon

David and his crew saved the day when Active movers no showed and Integrity movers was super unprofessional and lets just say integrity shouldn't be their name.    David came over and moved us quickly and there was no damage to our things. His employees were professional as well. We defiantly will use them again and I highly recommend them!   Thanks David!

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! If you can call it that. Had my move schedule for today 9-17-2014, sent conformation email last week and spoke to the clown over the phone. Call him today asking where he was and he said he doesn't remember scheduling!!! Spoke with another moving company and they said they had to clean up Active Movers mess multiple times Clown that owns the companies name is Ralph and is super unprofessional.
