LOVE this place. I'm vegan and finding a non-vegan place that accomodates vegans so well is difficult but this place makes it a breeze. Not only do they have vegan options, they have a full vegan menu that accompanies their standard menu. This place is an awesome go-to regardless of dietary preferences, but don't knock the veg options. I've had other guests stop and ask what I'm eating because it looks so good, only to find out I've got the vegan option! I definitely recommend the stuffed sandwiches. They're HUGE (I always have enough to save half for later) and only end up costing about $7-8. Plus, Pizza Heaven offers both cheesecake and angel bites (fried dough with chocolate sauce or agave), which are delicious and vegan.

This place might be my favorite restaurant in AZ. The food is all incredibly affordable, always served very quickly and the options are great. This place boasts an impressive vegan and vegetarian menu and literally everything on it is amazing. Service is always good as well, my drinks are always refilled, food comes fast, and the staff is very kind.  Overall, definitely recommend! Great way to experience Ethiopian food and great dinner out without spending a lot.

My favorite AZ vegan place, easily. If you're vegan, there's not a thing on the menu you won't like. If you're not vegan, the same's true but I'd definitely recommend the sandwiches over anything else for a newbie. The mock meats and cheeses will blow you away. Be prepared to always get dessert here, it's hard not to be tempted and it's all delicious. Overall, will always recommend, great for vegans and non-vegans.

While the food is pretty good and there's a big selection on the menu, it's hard to justify the cost when you've got a slew of other awesome Mexican places nearby for much less. The people were super friendly though and there's online ordering available, which makes this a better option despite cost at times.

Went here for a bang trim, since my usual place is too far. I typically have a bad experience when I get my bangs cut, with hairdressers always chopping them too bluntly or too short. Pamela cut my bangs and was amazing at gauging exactly what I wanted, she understand the too short, too choppy issue without me saying anything and was quick, to boot. I've decided just from this bang trim to make Pamela my regular stylist. Overall, great experience and would recommend!

Great place to grab a quick and cheap bite to eat! The prices are low and the food tastes much better than their competition, namely Filiberto's. While the default options aren't the most vegetarian/vegan friendly, they make it easy to customize what you want (I always get a bean burrito with rice and potatoes). The portions are huge and they have an open chips and salsa bar, with plastic bags and cups to take some to go. They're open late too (1:00 AM), so great when you need a late night junk food fix.

This was my first time getting my brows threaded, so I was pretty picky but the other great reviews made this place seem like the smart choice. Have to say, I was blown away by the quality of my brow threading! It was quick, they were well-shaped (I had been growing my brows back new) and the process was not very painful. A lot of people warned me about the pain of threading, but this was about the same as waxing, if not less painful.   As someone with fresh brows to work with, the shape I wanted was 100% taken into consideration and my opinion was always confirmed before continuing on my brows. My wait time was very short (I didn't make an appointment, just walked in). Overall, great experience and would definitely recommend, especially for eyebrow threading!

As regular vegan foodie, I was very excited to try Aside of Heart. The place itself is cute, with nice decor and atmosphere. I got the brownie and the jackfruit carnitas burrito. The brownie was honestly very disappointing - dry, crumbly, not at all what you think of for a brownie. While I get that some foods are hard to make vegan, brownies don't fall in that category and I regret paying that much for something OK. The burrito was a bit better, but just as a personal preference not something I'd get again.   My biggest issue with Aside of Heart actually goes beyond the food experience though. As a vegan place, I'd expect greater concern for animals but there is a betta on display in a fish bowl. Fish bowls are known to be incredibly cruel living spaces for fish and to be vegan and demonstrate that as acceptable is incredibly hypocritical.  Bettas, despite misinformation, need a sizable tank that includes a filter and heater (betta need filtration of their waste, like any other fish, and they typically live in warmer water and its virtually impossible to consistently regulate water temp in a bowl). While I would like to write this off as accidental ignorance, I'd like to think vegan people would understand the importance of researching an animal before taking one in to care for.  Overall, unhappy with this place and would not recommend.

Good selection, cheap prices, and fast service. I usually call in or order online for pick up and no matter how fast I get there, I never have to wait. Delivery is fast too, with a low minimum order cost. China Jade is a good go-to for a lazy night in.
