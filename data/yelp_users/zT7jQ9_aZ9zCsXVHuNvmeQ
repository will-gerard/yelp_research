Wandered in here on a Friday night. Was seated quickly, and the menu was large...seems like a chain vs. family owned establishment. Not worries.  We were served by the most timid hipster-faced mumbler I've ever met. Seriously could not understand a word he said. I asked for a kids menu for my 13 year old daughter, and he immediately questioned my motives, asking "just who is this for?" I explained that my youngest was 14 and special needs and couldn't read such a vast menu with so many choices.....he awkwardly left the table to get our drinks. He then asked to take our order and I had to ask him again to bring a kids menu to the table. We ask if the guacamole is fresh in house. He said yes, and that he recommended it highly , because he just came out here for his night off to have dinner with a friend and that is what he ordered. Okay, then bring it to us. I am pretty sure that it was the Wholly Guacamole brand from Costco. I buy it all the time, and I know the taste.   I have some recent IBD issues, and have to stay away from beans at all costs, so it was hard for me to find a menu item without beans. I finally settle on a salad that is to have Grilled chicken, calabacitas, parmesan cheese and a blend of mixed greens tossed in Cilantro Lime dressing. I looked up clabacitas and noted it had no beans in it (it was supposed to contain corn, zucchini, sweet and poblano peppers). My salad comes with black beans...At first I was not sure if it was my mistake or theirs, so I ask to see the menu. Sure enough, there is no mention of black beans anywhere on the salad description. When I bring this to the attention of our server, he says "Oh, this is awkward, I hate it when something like this happens. I don't know what to do...." Then he mumbled off....awkward really is the only word for the service we received. Our bill came for the full amount, and we paid it. As much as I tried to eat around the black beans, the meal still managed to get me sick.  I might go back just to have mumble mouth serve us again. He was so awkwards he was entertaining. But the food really wasn't good enough to warrant a second try.-

When researching an economical yet comfortable place to stay in Phoenix, we settled on the Radisson.    I will give it kudos on being quiet. The lobby, restaurant, hallways and rooms were nicely appointed, and not at all tacky. It looks like a remodel had been done recently.  I have a scale for judging hotels that Hubs lovingly refers to as "The 3 ts": Thread count, Towels, and T.P.  The Radisson passed the first T...the sheets were soft, and the down pillows meant I didn't have to bring my own from home (a plus in my book)  But, the other 2 T's were a complete fail.  Now, it was Valentine's Day weekend, and I didn't want to be a killjoy, but I found myself complaining about the towels the moment I got out of the shower....they were tiny, not at all absorbent, and dingy....I know that chlorine is a big environmental no-no....but, when I'm using a towel that Lord-only-knows where it's been...I like to know that a level of disinfecting (aka bleach) has ensued. I quickly caught myself, and told Hubs I was channeling my mother for a moment, but there was really nothing wrong.   Then he took a shower and came out saying "I don't think I've been in a gym in the country that had worse towels. I've stayed in flea-dives that had better towels"....so, I was NOT imagining things. I was afraid to use the wash cloth.  My opinion of the hotel might be hindered by the fact that Herbalife was hosting some sort of weekend seminar there, and there were Herba-low-lifes crawling all over the place. I actually saw a man wearing a paisley tie with a MATCHING BASEBALL HAT....  And the 3rd T? Let's just say that, by the end of the 3rd night I had some serious chaffing issues.....sandpaper is softer than their toilet paper!  Would I stay there again? Possibly....you couldn't beat our Hotel-dot-com rate ($80/night).... but I'd have to bring my own towels/TP.

They had us the moment we drove up the bark chipped driveway, through the arbor, and up to the patio with red checked table cloths.  the day before, we had breakfast at La Grande Orange, and my husband was sure I couldn't top that experience...but Yelp did not disappoint!!  I had the Monte Cristo....slow roasted Black Forest Ham, thinly sliced, and served with an egg-over (had mine over hard...it's a yolk thing) with swiss cheese and sandwiched between brioche french toast....delightful!  Hubs had a sausage omelet with veggies and hash browns....  To speak to the prices...I honestly don't think that paying $10-$11 per breakfast entree is exorbitant. Especially when you realize that they are serving food made from mostly organic, and all premium sources.There is a price involved when a restaurant stays true to a seasonable and sustainable food source, and I'm willing to pay a few bucks extra for "slow food" vs. fast.  the $9 Bloodies were a bit steep, but by the time I had mine plus half of my husbands, I was as happy as can be:)  Warning: only visit the Morning Glory Cafe when you have time to relax and enjoy....uptight people need not attend...be prepared to stroll through the Artist's Studio and Maya's Farm....we stayed so long we almost went to lunch at the Farm Kitchen!  We look forward to coming back for dinner at Quinessence next time we visit Phoenix.  Big love to Wayne Smith for creating such a delightful venue!!

Worst. Breakfast. Ever.   I wanted to like this spot. It was a free breakfast promotion through MGM, so I had very low expectations....even so, I left feeling as if I'd been robbed...   Watered down coffee. Rubbery eggs. But the worst was the sausage patty that purported to be chicken, but I suspect cardboard was the main ingredient.   It is all set in a bowling alley of a dining room, and the coffee always managed to be cold by the time it was poured into my cup.   It WAS a free breakfast. You get what you pay for. You couldn't pay me to eat there again ....

Hubs was down with pneumonia in a motel room (Kill. Me. Now) and sent me out for organic orange juice and a bagel. In Arizona. He may as well have sent me out for  a needle in a haystack. Arizona isn't as into the bagel scene as Portland.  Made it to Dunkin Donuts, which I understand now carries all kinds of bagels (who knew?) But they were OUT of OJ!! I backed out of the drive through, and looked to my Yelp oracle for guidance....  Once again, Yelp did not disappoint. It sent me to Z-Cafe.... a great concept cafe.... nothing but a counter fridge, and expresso machine, a juicer and 3 hot plates.... but they turn out some seriously good and fresh food. I got fresh squeezed orange juice and a bagel with cream cheese, but I saw some yummy omelets being made.....will stop by on my next visit to Mesa.

I really wanted to like this place. Becky had me so ready for a good experience.....Hubs is from Houston, and loves a good casual BBQ joint, and we'd been on the road for 2+ hours, so just getting out of the car to stretch our legs was a treat.  We arrived at a fun looking place, with cow hides all over, and lone stars everywhere. The smell from the smoker told me it was a solid choice, and I was already patting myself on the back for leading my family here.   Greeted by a man (Bruce) whom I assume is a relative of the owners....most likely the dad who was grumpy to have to work that day, and completely unfamiliar with the workings of this deli/restaurant.  He greeted me brashly and told me that we could sit anywhere we want. We chose a quiet table in a room just off to the side of the main dining room, but in plain sight of the server. This evidently pissed him off to no end, because he said in a gruff voice "NO one ever sits HERE" and every other glass/cup/plate he brought out from them on was slammed on the table. He would then tend to another table, and he was as pleasant as pie, so I assume he just had it in for us because we didn't sit in the main dining room.  There were only a few tables when we got there just before 1pm, and they were already out of the cowboy caviar....it was a busy Friday afternoon, and I could hear from the server's other conversations that they were gearing up for a big medieval festival, so I didn't understand how they could be out of their specialty side so quickly.....but, no matter.  I really thought Bruce was going to have an aneurysm  when he took our order... I'm thinking Bruce should be out back tending to the smoker.... But,  I really wasn't offended, as much as amused by his "soup nazi" mentality.  I ordered beer. Took 15 minutes to get it, but it WAS good....served in a tall jelly jar, and only $1 :) Made me happy.  One ear of corn, which I ordered for my daughter was $3.... made me sad....especially since it was over cooked and soggy :(( Corn should never be soggy, unless it comes from the state fair, or from a can....  If I had to order from there again, I would get the chopped instead of the sliced brisket....the veins of fat in the brisket were thick and had to be cut off before I could eat it. The chopped brisket, on the other hand, was cheaper in price, and yielded way more edible beef. The smoke flavor was not very strong, and the BBQ sauces seemed to be watered down.  A family of four ate a lunch there and the meal with tip was over $60...that was with NO dessert, and only $4 worth of beer. It is in a remote area by a destination golf course, so it probably does well with the locals, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again.

I was looking for a treat to bring my 91 year old grandmother when I came to Arizona to visit. Once again, Yelp steered me to the right place. I went there every day of our vacation, except for Sunday, when they were sadly not not open. The cupcakes were so moist and tasty, and the icings were so rich and dense, and not too sweet. We tried the peanutbutter chocolate, the lemon, seasalt caramel, death by chocolate, strawberry shortcake, peanut butter sugar cookie.... I wish I'd tried the bacon or beer ones, but I ran out of time!   Definitely worth the trip! Will be back when I am in town again!!
