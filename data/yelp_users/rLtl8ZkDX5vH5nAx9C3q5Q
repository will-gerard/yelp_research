I have no clue what this place is.  I went a few days ago for the Femocracy show and I'm not really sure what that was either.  I'm not really into the Phoenix art scene so I don't get a lot of the stuff that goes on here so I'll do my best to describe my experience.  The Alwun house is just a big house in downtown Phoenix that hosts different art events.  When I went, the house was filled with erotic art which was eclectic and well...erotic.  In back there is a large, mostly-covered area with a stage and plenty of seating.  This is where I saw "Femocracy" which was a bunch of artsy and somewhat humorous skits.  It was entertaining but I won't review it because I don't think it has anything to do with the actual Alwun House.  Anyway, the back of the house is a nice area and a nice place to chill if the weather is nice and you are into artsy stuff that may be playing on the stage.  There is a bar that serves very minimal cocktails.  I was there to support a friend and I'm all for supporting the local art scene, but I probably won't be back unless I have to.  The Alwun House was very interesting to say the least and everybody that visits and works there is very nice.

This was stop numero uno on our group's light rail bar crawl.  None of us had ever been there before so we were excited to see what this place was all about.  Situated about a 10ish minute walk from the light rail station, it is a nice walk through a part of town where I wouldn't normally be.  You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.  I ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.  Pro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.  Otherwise you will be dodging traffic as you try to cross because the place is located on the other side of the street far from another crosswalk.  Anyway, I would like to come back for a few beers and food.  I would also like to do the brewery tour.

I was looking forward to trying this place for a long time.  The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great (not the best) cut of steak at a reasonable price, then Texaz is the place to go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy.  I was seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  You could tell from the looks of the place that it had been around a while.  I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The d√©cor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time and enjoying their meals.  There were also plenty of wait staff bustling around.  While everything on the menu sounded delicious (but NOT diet friendly), I opted for the filet.  Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent.  My salad came quickly and was very good.  However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.  For dessert I ordered the homemade pecan pie and it was probably among the best I have ever had.  If you are looking for an upscale steak/bbq joint then this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for place with some good meat with good prices and excellent service, then this is the place for you.

Went here a few nights ago with a party of 4.  We just missed the dinner rush and had the place all to ourselves.  There are tons of reviews on here that pretty much cover everything, but here are some points to consider:  * Water is served in plastic cups * Soda comes from the can so there are no refills ($3 for a can!) * The bread is 'eh and costs you $3 * the bruschetta is just ok * The fresh mozzarella is awesome * The pasta is fresh and delicious * The tiramisu is fresh, fluffy, creamy and delicious  The best part about this place is the owner, Richard Bock.  Although he jokes around and is super friendly, you can tell he knows what he is doing when it comes to his food and his restaurant.  From the prices he charges to the way he pushes the higher priced menu items, you can tell he is a sucker for the bottom line.  I admit I am one of those people who is all into going to places featured on TV, especially DDD so this place was on my list.  It didn't hurt either that there was a 50% off certificate on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  I'm not going to rush back because the place is pretty far from home, but if I am in the area and craving some almost homemade Italian, I will be sure to stop in again.

This was probably the best Yelp even I've ever been to.  Tons of great food and drink.  Capital Grille was promoting their new lunch menu and everything they were sampling was great.  From the shrimp to the tenderloin sliders everything was top notch.  I only wish I worked closer to a Capital Grille because I would definitely do lunch there.  So until they open for lunch during the weekend I will be unable to enjoy more of their lunch stuffs.

Top notch food and top notch service.  That is what you get at Capital Grille.  A few notes:  * The shrimp cocktail sauce lacks the kick of Mastro's "atomic" horseradish sauce and is blahhhhhhhh.  * I ordered the Delmonico steak which was awesome but I should not have gotten the porcini sauce/rub because I don't think balsamic vinegar belongs anywhere near a steak IMHO.  * Au Gratin potatoes had a wee too much garlic  * Lobster mac n' cheese = PHENOMENAL  Anyway, I wish I could eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day if money or having a heart attack wasn't an issue.

For some reason I have never had a "full" meal in the dining area the 2 times I have been here.  Instead, my wife and I have chosen to sit in the bar area because it is normally later in the evening when we go and we just want something quick and casual.  We normally just order a few things to share and here are some of our favs and un-favs:  * The Steamers Clam Chowder - it is AWESOME!  They put both New England and Manhattan chowder in the same bowl.  Not mixed together though...on separate sides.  * The Steamers Wedge - EXCELLENT and HUGE.  * Rocky Point Shrimp Cocktail - I honestly don't think it is very good.  I think it lacks flavor and kick.  I would just stick to a regular shrimp cocktail in the future.  The service is always excellent as they are very fast and friendly.  The prices are on the high side but that's what you get for wanting decent seafood in the Biltmore area.  Although I am always there way after happy hour has ended; the specials look awesome.  If I am ever in the area around happy hour time then I will definitely make a visit.

I've been to the Scottsdale location dozens of times but this was my first Phoenix experience.  I have to say that I like this location better.  It wasn't way over-crowded or way too loud like the Scottsdale location.  They do pretty much force you to valet park which I am not a big fan of, but everything else was better than the Scottsdale location.  I especially liked it that the refills came fast and without asking.  The waiters/servers didn't seem as flustered as they do at the other location.  Anyway, the food was pretty solid as always and there are really no bad choices on the menu.  I had the grilled artichoke which was phenomenal, Caesar salad and a burger.  The apple cobbler thing was just 'eh.

I'm still not sure why they closed Houston's and opened this up down the street.  It is basically the same thing.  The only real difference is that the decor is awesome and super swank.  I want my house to look like this place.  The food and service is the same as Houston's and is top notch as always.  I always get some sort of beef when I am there and I swear next time I'm going to get a cooked fish dish or the sushi.

Went here for lunch Saturday afternoon with a party of 4.  I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.  I really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that, the ordering your food and picking it up process is pretty haphazard and is not helped by tons of people trying to make their way through the place filled with shelves of random stuff.  HOWEVER.....  EVERYTHING and I do mean EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious.  Breakfast to lunch and everything in between is excellent.  You really cannot go wrong.  Even their pre-made salads are excellent.  Their menu is not too complicated but it is very well thought out and I bet they have some of your favorites, but with their special twist.  Anyway, everything is top notch.

I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.  After sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.  The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.  I would definitely return but hope the service is better.

It is no secret that I am not very handy around the house.  I like to tinker but when electricity is involved I tend to not deal with it.  So, when my backyard floodlights weren't working, I knew I needed professional help.  After a quick Yelp search I found Micor and decided to give them a call based solely on their reviews.  They sent a person out to my house within a half hour and had my lights working not long after.  The best part is that I wasn't even home.  I arranged it all from my workplace.  Sure it was a little bit sketchy having a stranger in my backyard doing god knows what because of a problem I probably described poorly.....but it all turned out ok.  I tested the light after I got home then called their office to pay.  I hope I don't have any electrical problems in the future, but if I do I will call Micor.

I swear I am here every frikkin weekend for one reason or another.  This place, like all the other Home Depots, offers everything under the sun for the home and provides excellent service when you can track down a sales associate.  The thing I hate about this place, and I know it probably isn't their fault, is the parking lot.  It is one of the most horrific layouts every conceived.  The perimeter is a maze of bullsht and I almost get in an accident every time.  I would literally slap whoever came up with the design.

My wife and I went here for dinner last Friday night.  Wanting a super casual dinner this place fit the bill.  We both haven't been to the Islands since our college days when it was on Mill.  Turns out not much has changed.  This place still churns out some decent burgers at reasonable prices.  We each got a burger, shared a salad and a basket of fries.  Everything was quite good but the fries are awesome.  You really can't beat a bottomless basket of awesome fries for like $3 even-though we didn't come close to finishing it.  Aside from the fries being delicious, I like it that each of their beef burger selections can also be ordered as a turkey burger.  I didn't order my burger this way but my wife did and she said it was very good.  Another thing to note is the service.  I thought it was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and fast.  My diet coke refills arrived faster than I could drink them and that is a definite plus.  In my opinion this place is on top of their game in terms of service and food and is a solid burger place in my book.

I needed 2 pairs of pants altered in a hurry so I looked on Yelp for a solid place by my house.  I couldn't be happier with this place.  The service, price and quality I received were excellent.  My pants were ready at the date and time promised and there were no issues.  I am glad to have found a great tailor close by and will definitely be back.

The staff is friendly and the massage was decent, but this place is worse than a car dealership.  Before and after your massage your are bombarded with sales pitches.  Memberships, lotions, upgrades, etc.  Also, lets say you buy their stupid membership and don't use your monthly massage.  So, suppose you want to give that massage to somebody else.  That will cost you a transfer fee.  Whoever came up with the Massage Envy idea is brilliant and probably a billionaire right now.  However, it won't be long until a better place comes along that offers quality massages at a cheaper price without the high-pressure sales environment.

I was very skeptical of this place because I am normally not a fan of strip center Mexican food places.  This location isn't the newest and nicest but it is definitely a solid joint and far exceeded my expectations.    Our server/waiter was fast, friendly and courteous.  The chips and salsas brought to the table when you sit down were fresh and excellent.  I especially loved loved loved the red one.  I bought a pint to take home to put on EVERYTHING.  There is just enough spice and great flavor.  There is some secret ingredient but I can't place it.  We also ordered the melted cheese thing for an appetizer and it was awesome cheesy goodness.  Next time we are going to order it with green chilies.    My wife and I split the "Fajitas for 2" with 1/2 chicken and 1/2 steak.  I thought it was excellent.  The meat was tender and juicy and there were plenty of sauteed onions and peppers throughout.  There was also more than enough for 2 people.  The flour tortillas were also fresh and delicious.  Their guacamole was less than stellar however.  This is probably one of my favorite local Mexican places and I can't wait to go back.

My wife has never been here before so I figured it was about time.  Every Phoenician should go here at least once.  So, last Friday night as a monsoon was "supposed" to roll in, we decided to pay the Rooste a visit.  The parking lot at the top was full so we parked at the bottom.  I wouldn't have minded the walk up but they have a shuttle that will take you so that was nice.  I guess the best way to describe this place is a big western saloon with an awesome view of the city.  Maybe "saloon" doesn't do it much justice but it is all I could think of.  It is just very westerny.  The place was pretty packed but we didn't mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style.   Our waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don't understand why places can't hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.  I love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn't get much better than that.  My wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.  I know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don't like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don't come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.  Anyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.  Kids also seem to love the balloon animals, magic, the slide, and the little paper bull horn hats they give them.  Also, when you go, I would recommend sharing your entree.  The amount of meat they give you is more than enough for 2 people.   Although a monsoon didn't end up rolling in which would have been nice to watch up there, we had a good time anyway.

My wife and I went here Saturday evening with another couple.  The place was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  We were also the only non-Asians there so this was a good sign that this was an authentic place.  The general look of this place also set the vibe that this was authentic as you can get in Arizona...you know...with the hanging roast ducks and pork, the non-English as a first language staff, etc.  Anyway, I was looking forward to this meal.  What I wasn't looking forward to was the service.  Almost every single Yelp review slams this place's service.  Almost everybody thinks it is horrible and even the people that we went with had dined there before and said it wasn't very good.  I however thought the service wasn't bad at all and was actually pretty good.  Sure our waiter didn't speak very good English which made it a bit difficult but he was pretty friendly, brought everything we asked for (forks, napkins, etc.), didn't screw up our order and was super fast with my diet coke refills.  So I have absolutely no complaints on the service.  The food:  * Sizzling rice soup = pretty good.  I want to try the hot and sour next time though. * Lo Mein = pretty standard like every other place but it was very good. * Sliced roast pork = excellent and not overly sauced * Salty fish and chicken fried rice = I have no idea why we ordered this and really wasn't my choice but my friend insisted we try it.  It actually wasn't as bad as it sounds but it was in fact a bit weird for my palate.  I think I should stick to fried rice without the fish though next time.  Anyway, the place is definitely worth a try.  Just don't let the look of the place or most of these reviews scare you away.

My wife and I went here with another couple last night.  All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.  It was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.  Now about the food....  After they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.  Here is what we ordered:  * Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.  * Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.  * BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\marinade was not too strong.  * Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the "crazy" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.  Anyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!

Took my mom and grandma here for Mother's Day.  I was surprised that it wasn't crowded at all but I'm not sure if that is normal or not because I've never been here before.  We arrived at about 6pm and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was a bit over-the-top-friendly but was excellent nonetheless.  * Bread and butter you get to start = very good.  excellent garlic butter stuff.  * Sauteed calamari appetizer = I wanted the fried but my wife said no.  The sauteed was very good though.  I would order it again.  The leftover sauce was great to dip the bread in.  * Caesar salad = all the entress come with a basic side salad but I opted for the Caesar.  No idea why it was $6 more though.  It was just ok and I think it was just the regular salad with Caesar dressing and croutons.  I would not get this again.  * Lasagna = Very good.  This really isn't your standard piece of deep dish lasagna.  It was about an inch thick and looked to be all "hand-crafted".  The portion size was perfect and wasn't ginormous.  It could have been a bit more flavorful though.  Not sure I would order this again because there are tons of other things on the menu that look excellent.  Veil looks like their "thing".  Their homemade gnocchi also sounded excellent.  * Tiramisu = Excellent.  It is homemade and very different from other tiramisus I've had previously.  It was very light, very creamy and was without a lot of the "cake" I expected.  The highlight of the meal (for me at least) was the complementary shots of flaming sambuca they offered at the end the meal.  There was no way I could turn this down. This was my first flaming shot and after some coaching from our waiter it was a smooth one!  All-in-all it was a good meal.  Mom and grandma enjoyed it and had some leftovers to take home so all was good.  I do however think the prices are way high and it is probably some of the more expensive Italian food in town which is weird for a strip mall in Mesa.  Pro Tip:  Go to Restaurant.com and get a gift certificate for a couple bucks and save yourself $25.  Well worth it.

When my dentist told me I had to have a root canal I was scared shitless.  I've had cavities before but this freaked me out.  He referred me here and I couldn't have been happier with the experience.  Dr. Stephen Walker and the entire staff were very courteous, professional, friendly, and most importantly made the entire experience pain free.  I hope I never have to have another root canal, but I'm coming here if I do.

I needed a new gate for my house so asked my good friend Google.  This placed popped up and they have a solid web site and look pretty reputable ( www.actiongateaz.com ).   I sent them a request for an estimate via their online contact form.  They got back to me via email after a few days to schedule an appointment.  Their rep (Gary) arrived within the time-window given.  Turns out he is the owner and couldn't have been a nicer guy.  He looked at my current gate configuration and listed the replacement options in an honest and straightforward way.  My wife and I decided on a new gate on the spot and placed the order.  He said it would take about 3 weeks to make and install the thing because his company is so busy.  The only bummer is that it took over a month but it is ok because our new gate looks fantastic.  Scheduling the estimate and install were both a breeze, they have great customer service and a great product.  I'm told my gate is going to last forever so I probably won't have to use this company again, but I would in a heartbeat if needed.  The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't call me after the install to make sure everything was ok.  Another thing is that I chose a stupid handle/lock combo and Gary didn't tell me it was dumb when I ordered it.

My wife and I met 2 friends at the bar for some happy hour and dinner action last night.  It was about 6:30 and I think we snagged just about the last open table.    I was pretty impressed with their happy hour selections and prices.  The ladies had glasses of wine and the guys had a Kettle martini with blue cheese olives (my absolute fav!).  The martini was excellent especially because it was 6 bucks.  The wine pour was a bit skimpy though.  The 4 of us shared the crab cake appetizer and it was excellent and will definitely order it again.  For an entree I ordered the sliced fliet mignon burger sans bun.  It is exactly as it sounds; basically a sliced filet mignon.  It was pretty thick so I have no idea how people actually eat the thing on a bun.  Anyway it was excellent as well as good sized.  I would order it again but I keep reading about how the Fleming's prime burger is very good not to mention a 3rd of the cost of the sliced filet burger.  I will probably try that next time.  My wife ordered the portebello mushroom burger and it was awesome.  It was topped with sauteed spinach and goat cheese.  OMG sooo good!  I should order that next time to put on top of a real burger.  It  was actually very good and I could see myself ordering that if I was not in the mood for red meat.  For dessert we all shared the lava cake.  WOW! Sooo good!  You have to order it 20 minutes in advance so you know it is fresh.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a bowl of fresh homemade whip cream.  The whole thing was just awesome but that whip cream put it over the edge.  The entire staff that waited on us during the evening were very fast and friendly.  All-in-all it was an excellent evening with great food and service.  I will definitely be back!

I have been coming here for well over 5 years and is one of my favorite sushi places in the valley.  You wouldn't expect much from a tiny sushi place in Gilbert, but this place is definitely worth a shot.  The service is always fast and friendly.  Their prices are reasonable and have an excellent selection of  fresh sushi.  I have even told the chefs to "surprise me" a few times and they have always delivered some pretty amazing rolls.

My wife has been wanting to try this place for some time now so we decided to meet 2 friends of ours there on Sunday for brunch.  I was not as thrilled to try this place because I thought it was going to be yet another typical breakfast place just like all the rest.  I just hate going out to battle the Sunday breakfast crowds just to have the same ole' omelet or other run-of-the-mill breakfast item that tastes the same as every other place.  I convinced myself that the parking situation was going to be a complete clusterfuq like it is at just about any other trendy breakfast spot in Scottsdale, but it was quite the opposite.  There is ample free parking and we found a spot without hassle.  I was surprised to see that the area actually wants people there instead of making it a complete pain to visit like some areas up north.  It just pisses me off when the idiots of Scottsdale rope off 100 more parking spots then they need and use it for valet parking.  Ok, my rant is over.  Anyway, upon arrival at the Liberty Market there was a giant line and the place was real busy.  I expected this but was a bit pissed.  Luckily our friends saved us a place in line so it wasn't that bad.  I would advise coming as early as possible to avoid any crowds.  We ordered our food, took our seats and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food.  A bit long but it was expected because of how busy it was.  Their breakfast menu is not huge and had the staples as well as some unique items on it.  I ordered the Western Scramble and it was excellent!  I love meaty and cheesy when it comes to eggs and this was perfect.  I was a bit skeptical of the horseradish sauce that comes with it but I think it actually makes the meal.  It was an awesome combination.  My wife ordered the grilled vegetable scramble with egg whites and it was excellent as well.  We especially enjoyed the fresh biscuit and honey that came with our meals.  I also recommend the scone which our table shared.  The scones come with a side of fresh whip cream which was delightful.  Anyway, I was a big fan of the breakfast and would definitely come back if I am in the area again come breakfast/brunch time.....or maybe even lunch time because their salads and sandwiches looked great!  I am a big fan of that little stretch of Gilbert Road and there are a few other places along it I would like to try in the near future.  I can't wait to go to Joe's BBQ which is right across the street.

My wife and I attended an event here last night.  They set out a pretty good spread buffet style.  * Bikinitini - this is their new 99 calorie drink.  It was very good light and refreshing.  I'm more of a regular martini guy but it never hurts to try something new.  * Porcini rubbed filet mignon and peppercorn steak - both were excellent, tender, juicy and very very tasty.    * Roasted mushroom ravioli - HOLY COW!  This was amazing.  This is only an appetizer on the menu though for some reason.  I swear I had about 10 of these things.  Next time I go to Flemings I'm going to get a steak on top of a bed of these raviolis.   As always, the staff of Flemings was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back.  The event we attended was through Foodies Like Us (www.foodieslikeus.com).  It was $15 per person and well worth it for all the great food, wine and cocktails.  It was a bit too crowded though.  Anyway, it is a solid group of people that attend different dining events around the valley.  Check it out.

My wife and I went here with a friend last night.  We had reservations for 7:30 and like always the place is jam-packed.  I have been here 3 or 4 times previously for dinner and it is always the same.  It is almost impossible to find a decent parking spot or be seated in under 20 minutes.  Well I guess good for them for having such a busy/popular restaurant.  Anyway, as per usual we were seated about 20 minutes late.  About 4 waiters/hosts/etc. came up to us to tell us how truly sorry they were so that was kinda nice.  They even gave us a spinach dip appetizer (my wife's absolute fav) on the house so that more than made up for being seated later than we should have.  I ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was excellent as always.  I LOVE the croutons.  For an entree I had the ribs per my wife's recommendation.  My wife is a huge Houston's fan and has been there dozens more times than I so I trusted her opinion on this.  Anyway, she was correct and they were excellent.  They weren't overly sauced and the meat was fall off the bone tender.  The fries that came with were also very good.  My wife got the halibut and it was just ok.  It was very plain but she enjoyed it so that's what counts.  Our friend had the filet and it looked excellent.  The food there is always pretty solid and you always know what you are going to get.  My only complaint is that because it is so busy, the waiters/waitresses/etc. get a bit overwhelmed and sometimes forget things and take a bit longer than they should.  I guess it isn't their fault but is probably Houston's fault for not hiring more service staff.  All-in-all it was a very good dinner.

My wife and I ordered delivery from here last weekend.  The food came when it was promised and nothing was screwed up.  This place is pretty solid but its your typical Americanized Chinese stuff you find in every strip mall out here.  Nothing fantastic but it does the trick.

My wife got me the BEST GIFT EVER for my birthday - the Master Teppanyaki Chef Experience (www.benihana.com/bethechef)!  I love teppanyaki probably more than I should and definitely more than anyone in my family so I don't get to go as often as I would like.  I mean it's dinner AND a show!  How can it NOT be awesome with fancy food tricks, fried rice, shrimp, and steak?  Mix in some saki bombers and you can't go wrong.  For the Master Chef Experience you are trained at the fine art of teppanyaki then are able to bring your friends/family in for dinner that you cook.  Training is held Monday through Thursday at 1:00ish which I guess is understandable because they don't want you messing around with knives and hot food in the midst of the lunch or dinner rush.  It still pisses me off though because I work during normal business hours.  I guess it is a small price to pay to hopefully make a fire volcano and fling some shrimp at my wife.  The training was awesome.  My personal teppanyaki chef/teacher (Hideo) and I pretty much had the place to ourselves so I would not be embarrassed if I sprayed rice everywhere.  The training took about 30 minutes and my teacher pretty much went over everything.  He taught me some tricks, some jokes and of course some safety stuff that went in one ear and out the other.  The whole thing was a blast.  On the day of the big even where I would cook for my family they gave me an apron and chefs hat so I looked pretty legit.  Everything went off without a hitch and I made some awesome teppanayaki.  My technique still needs some work but I did excellent for my first time.  Anyway, the whole experience was a blast and I would recommend it to anyone.  The manager (I don't have his name) and Hideo were awesome and really did make the whole thing special throughout my training and main event.

After a year of knee pain when climbing stairs and doing squats n' stuff, I decided to see an orthopedic doctor.  Turns out there was nothing seriously wrong and nothing that couldn't be fixed with some physical therapy.  I chose Miller Physical Therapy because of their proximity to my house and their reviews here on Yelp.  Scheduling appointments went smoothly and everybody that I spoke to there was pleasant.    My doctor said that I was supposed to go 2 times per week for a month but I only went twice.  My therapist, Nick (totally reminds me of Will Ferrall), clearly explained what was wrong with my knee and how he planned to heal it.  After the second session I knew exactly what I had to do and was ready to work on it on my own.  I cancelled the rest of my appointments partly because I am lazy and didn't want to go but partly because the stuff I needed to do with my knee was relatively simple and I could do on my own so why pay someone else?  Anyway, Nick is awesome and although he doesn't know it, he almost totally cured my knee pain I've had for over a year.  I would recommend this place to anybody.  The facility isn't as hoity-toity and fancy as I had expected but was nice, clean and contained all the doodads necessary for physical therapy.

I filled out a request online @ www.corporateofficecenters.com to get pricing on a virtual office/mailbox in this location.  I received an automated email response saying they would get back to me in a few days but after a week or so went by with zero followup from them I decided to to call this location directly to get the details.  The lady I talked to was nice and quoted me $125 per month and promised to email me more information.  I am not that experienced in this type of thing but I think $125/month is a lot for just wanting a business address/mailbox.  I really dislike Corporate Office Centers.  All the poor reviews on Yelp are spot on.  My wife has an office at another one of their centers but I'm going to wait to write a review until she moves out.

I've been here a few times now and am now able to give this place an accurate review.  The first thing you should know is that this place gets packed during peak hours at all times of the year.  This isn't just a snow bird place and is more of a neighborhood joint.  So, make a reservation or be prepared to wait.  Also, the place is a bit cramped (cozy?) but there is not much that can be done about that.  The service is always excellent and the prices are a bit high.  All the entrees I've tried have been excellent.  It is best to stick with the Italian basics of which this place does the best in my opinion.  They try to be creative with some of their dishes (ex. caprese chicken) which they don't pull off as well as would be expected.  My favorites are he gnocchi and lasagna which are some of the best around.  Their homemade pasta dishes are also very good.  The only thing that pisses me off about this place is their bread which is plain and blah and that they charge you an extra $5 to upgrade their crappy side salad to a Caesar.  Anyway, it is nice to have a cozy, friendly, Italian spot with good food so close to home.

When I went to my car this morning to go to work I noticed a tire going flat.  Upon closer inspection I noticed a nail had punctured the tire.  After a quick Google map search for the closest possible place that could fix my tire, I found this place.  I gave them a call to be sure they were open and could fix my tire.  It was 7am so I was skeptical.  To my surprise a guy answered and told me they were in fact open and could fix my tire.  I slowly made the mile drive and was out of there in under an hour and only spent $22.  The service guy was friendly and fast.  I hope this never happens again but if it does I will be sure to come here!

This place has once again come to my rescue.  My car's tire pressure warning light thingy came on and I started to panic.  All the tires looked to be in good shape but I brought the car by the shop today before work just to be safe.  The manager guy told some younger guy to check the pressure on all the tires and top them off if necessary.  Turns out a few of them were a bit low.  The whole process took like 5 minutes and they didn't charge me anything but I slipped the kid a few bucks as a thank you.  Anyway, the light went off and I made it to work safely.  I know it was not rocket surgery, but tires, pressure, and air are all mysterious to me so I'm glad this place is there.

I needed to fill in some bald spots in my backyard and A&A was one of the first decent-looking links on my Google search.  So, on a hot Saturday morning a few weeks ago I dragged my wife here.  This was my first time buying rocks so I had no idea what to expect.  As soon as I pulled up I knew I was out of my element and somewhat intimidated.  However, the staff there were very friendly and helpful and I was able to get what I needed.  From weighing your car to finding the right rock pile to shoveling the rocks into bags......it was an interesting experience to say the least!  Also, I don't know the going rate for rocks but this place seems to have a good price.  I've been there twice now and probably bought 500 pounds of rocks for a total of like $25 which seems pretty good to me.

When a doctor alerted me of a worrisome mole thing on my body I figured I should visit a dermatologist to check it out.  I found this place via a quick Yelp search and made an appointment.  They were able to accommodate my schedule and the entire staff was very friendly.  My appointment was with Benjamin LeSueur.  He was prompt, friendly, and best of all didn't find anything to worry about during my full body skin scan.  I would definitely return if needed.....and I hope it isn't.

My child is now a month old so I guess it is safe to write this review because he seems to be healthy and happy.  Having never been to an OBGYN before I didn't know quite what to expect.  From my (a guy's) perspective the whole process was very smooth and I couldn't be happier with Dr. Deka and almost the entire office staff.  The office is clean, runs on time, and everybody is very helpful and friendly.  I made it to every single one of the prenatal appointments and Dr. Deka was always on time, very knowledgeable, and was patient with me when I asked stupid questions.  On the big day she was there to deliver our new family member and made it look easy.  Dr. Deka is a birthing rockstar and the entire process was completely enjoyable (at least for me because I didn't pass out).  If I have another child I will definitely use Dr. Deka.

This was my second trip to Picazzo's.  I went to one in Tempe when it first opened a few years ago.  I don't remember much about it but I guess it couldn't have been too bad because I went back.  This time, I went on a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was mostly dead.  We were seated promptly on the patio per our request because the weather is finally tolerable outside.    Our party of 3 ordered a cheap bottle of wine, the baked brie to start, a Caesar and a wedge salad, and a large thin crust pizza.  Our small salads were HUGE but very very good.  The large salads are probably as big as the table and could feed a small army.  The baked brie was also very sizable but very good as well.  The give you a bunch of flat bread, 2 roasted cloves of garlic and 2 melted chunks of brie.  The pizza (1/2 peperoni, sausage and ricotta, and 1/2 pesto & artichoke) was also very tasty.  I would definitely get the peperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza again.  The next time I visit I would just get a salad and pizza to share.  I didn't realize that the portions would be so ginormous.  The salads, appetizer and pizza could have seriously fed around 5 people.  I guess that is why they can get away with charging so much for their food.  I see some issues with the service here on Yelp, but our waiter was very fast and friendly and I couldn't have asked for anyone better.  I will definitely be back again.  Oh, and this place is on restaurant.com so before you go you can buy a $25 or $50 gift certificate for just a couple bucks.  It was well worth it for us and would do it again.

Friendly and fast service, decent prices and good food.  Solid lunch spot.  However, I hate this location.  It gets uber busy on weekends and is a hassle.  I hate driving around this horribly designed shopping plaza on a normal day but on the weekends it is even worse.  There is really nothing wrong with this Wildflower except for the location.  I'm going to stick to the one on Indian Bend.  Its much roomier.  Anyway, the Fiery Butternut Squash salad is awesome as is their chopped salad.  They are some of the best salads in town.

I've been getting my taxes done here for over 5 years.  Everybody at the firm is super friendly, helpful and very professional.  There are several accountants, but the only one I have used is Aaron Blau and he is excellent.  He takes the extra time needed to explain things to me because this tax stuff can be pretty confusing.  My wife started her law practice about a year ago and Aaron assisted in setting up the books, payroll and other misc. stuff including solid tax planning advice.  I like it that they are able to provide personal accounting services at a very reasonable price no matter what stage in life you are in or how much money you make.  I started with them when I was in college,  when I got my first real job and now my wife uses them for her law practice.  There were many different jobs and life-changes in between all that and they were able to provide advice and help plan for the future.  I guess the most important thing is that they successfully keep the IRS from knocking at our door while somehow getting us some $$$$ back!  Anyway, everything at the firm is top notch and we will continue to use their services for years to come.

I needed a battery for my watch and my wife needed to fix her watch band.  The owner (I assume) was very helpful, fast and friendly.  He replaced my battery and threw in fixing my wife's watch band for free.  After talking to him for a while, I was amazed to find he had several high-end watches, both new and used.  It was just surprising that he would have such merchandise at a kiosk in Arizona Mills. I'm not sure I'm ready to spend over 8k on a watch, but if any of my or my wife's watches/jewelry needs repair, then I will surely go back.

While I am not a huge fan of their food, I will drink almost anything, which is good because this Outback has some killer drink specials.  My wife and I went here for dinner a few weeks ago on a Saturday night.  The place was pretty busy but we were seated promptly.  They have glasses of decent wine for like 2 bucks ($20 bottles) and martinis for like $3.  The alcohol wasn't premium grade but wasn't plastic bottle stuff either so it was a pretty good deal.  I had a steak which was ok I guess and a wedge salad.  The wedge was excellent but they put some sort of sweet stuff in with the dressing I think.  Next time I would definitely order it without the sweet because then it would be an awesome salad.  To start we shared a shrimp on the barbie which was actually pretty good.  I'm really not the hugest fan of this place, I will return because it is kinda close to my house, has ok food, and great drink specials.

I love love love YC's.  Where else can I fill a bowl with massive amounts of meat and veggies for like $9?    I went here tonight with my wife and another friend.  It was about 6:30 and it wasn't that busy so that was nice.  It didn't take long for me to fill up my bowl with goodies to the brim and drown it in sauce.  I did mess up a bit with the sauce because it didn't turn out as spicy or as flavorful as I would have liked but it was still great.  In my opinion I don't come here nearly enough.  I probably only say that though because I purposely didn't view their nutritional info so I'm convinced it is relatively healthy.  I mean its not fried fast food stuff, right?  Anyway I love eating here.  The food is great for what it is, the price is right and the service is very good.  Plus I always have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Oh...and the frozen yogurt is garbage.

I really like bowling and I really really enjoy "extreme bowling".  I love the flashing lights, great music, etc. etc.  AMF Tempe is the only place I have ever extreme bowled so I can't compare it to anywhere else.  I went a lot during high school 15 years ago, but haven't gone back in many many years.  It is WAY better now.  Better music, upgraded computer things, nicer lanes, huge screens for music videos, etc.  Its all pretty nice and an excellent extreme bowling experience.  The crowd is still a bit sketchy but everyone was there to have a good time so no complaints there.  The staff is also excellent and pretty friendly.  It looked like they had decent beer specials and what looked to be decent bar type food.  I didn't get anything but I wouldn't mind eating, drinking and bowling the night away sometime in the future.  I went last night (Saturday) and it was $18 per person including shoe rental and all-you-can-bowl from 10pm until 1am.  Not really too bad of a deal if you stay there all 3 hours (which I didn't because I'm old now).  My group got there at about 9:40 right before a mad rush of people came in so my advice is to get there 20mins ahead of time to avoid standing in line forever.  They also take reservations so that may come in handy.

This is my absolute favorite middle eastern restaurant.  I have only been there 2 or 3 times, but for some reason I'm always treated like family.  The place has never been crowded and you get individual attention from the waiter/owner.  Everything on the menu from soup to shawarma is top notch.  The only downside to Byblos is that they do not make their own pitas from scratch as they are regular ole store bought ones :(

I went here on Saturday for the Kentucky Derby with a party of 4.  I knew it was going to be packed so I went in and reserved a table a few days prior.  It was $20 to reserve a table but that money goes toward your tab.  The place is pretty sketchy and I was expecting them to "lose" the money and/or my "reservation", but to my amazement they indeed had a nice table with my name on it when I arrived on Saturday afternoon.  The place was pretty busy so service wasn't exactly speedy gonzales, but it was very good considering the crowd.  Our drink orders came pretty quickly as did our food.  I had a burger and fries and it was good.  Typical bar food that was probably frozen at some point but it was pretty good nonetheless.  The prices on food/drinks are very reasonable as well.  I was surprised they didn't jack up all their prices because of the occasion.  They have a ton of TVs and plenty of tables/seating.  The entire place could use some updating but I guess that is all part of the charm of a sketchy off track betting place in Tempe.  Anyway, I had fun and the entire crowd as well as the entire staff of the place was very friendly.  I would definitely return if I'm ever in the mood for some horse/dog betting action.

This is probably the best Office Max in the area.  The workers there are very friendly and helpful - sometimes overly so.  You can't be in there for 15 minutes without 3 different people asking if you need help with anything.  It gets annoying but they mean well.  Their selection of stuff is great and their prices are very good as well.  Their Max Perks program is also very good especially if you are constantly shopping for office supplies.  However, I did by one of those extended warranty things they always push.  It was a clusterfuk of an experience when the printer I bought it on broke.  Anyway, they stress how easy it is to replace or get refunded a broken item, but that was FAR from the truth.

I am in a golf league through my work and play here about 20 times per year.  This isn't the nicest course around, but it gets the job done.  It is a relatively small executive course with mostly par 3's and 4's.  For the most part the course is very well taken care of.  Some of the holes are pretty challenging which is good.  Everybody in the pro shop is very friendly and helpful.  I pay $15 with a cart for 9 holes which I guess is pretty reasonable.  I'm not sure if that is the full rate because I am in a special league.  I'm not 100% sure but I think the driving range is free.  Before I tee off I usually grab a bucket, fill it with balls, and head to the range.  Everything is just laying there so I just take it.  I have no idea if I'm supposed to pay or not.

My home warranty company sent Runyon's to my home on two separate occasions.  I'm pretty sure I got the same technician too, George.  Both the staff that work the phones and George are friendly and professional.  My washing machine and stove were fixed without much hassle and are still functioning properly.  My only wish with this place (and just about all the other companies like them) is that they would be more accurate with their 4 hour windows.  Anyway, I am happy with the service I received and would definitely use them again.

This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.  The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!  Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!

I've worked 2 seconds from this place for 3 years but have been too scared to try it.  Not only is this a pretty sketchy area, but this place looks even sketchier.  It is a very small place in a shady strip mall.  There are maybe 3 tables in the joint, some pictures of their food on the wall and a glass counter where they sell a bunch of random Asian bric-a-brac which is also where they take your order.  Luckily I called ahead to order or it would have been a while to get food.  There is only one cook so things may take a while if there are more than 2 people ordering.  Anyway, the cashier/order taker lady was very nice on the phone and in person.  She was also running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to get orders ready.  This place was recommended by my coworkers but because I didn't have a menu, all I had to go on were the reviews on Yelp to use as a guide on what to order.  * Orange Chicken - came with fried rice and an egg roll.  The egg roll was pretty good but the fried rice was nasty.  It tasted stale and had a weird flavor.  The orange chicken was just ok.  I like it that they used big chunks of white meat chicken and the orange sauce a mild spice to it.  I wouldn't order the meal again though.  I could tell the ingredients weren't quality and everything was fried and overly greasy.  * Hot and Sour soup - This took about 30 minutes for this to cool down to "won't-scar-my-mouth-forever" temperature.  The soup was full of great ingredients including nice-sized shrimp and meat.  It looked excellent but the flavor just wasn't there.  The broth tasted sweet and was just weird.  I don't like to give sub-par reviews but I don't think I will be back here any time soon.

I hate to admit it, but yes, I do eat here occasionally.  About once every couple of months I break all the rules and get some junk food during lunchtime at work.  I happen to love fried chicken and it just so happens that this place is about a ten second drive from my office and is really the only place around.  I get the same thing every time I go:  the chicken strips with ranch dipping sauce and a giant diet coke.  SOOOO good but SOOOO bad for me.  It screws up my stomach for about a day and I always swear I'll never go back but I always do.  It is a bit on the expensive side for fried strips of chicken but whatever.  It is quick and easy and the people that work there are always friendly and quick with your order.

I went here today at about 11ish to pick up an early lunch.  There were 2 people there ahead of me.  The whole process from ordering to getting my meal was well under 10 minutes.  I really didn't know much about this place except for what I read on Yelp.  Seemed like a pretty solid place and not to far from my office so what the heck.  I wasn't expecting much because I am not really a fan of the just about the entire 85209 zip code as far as dining options go.  I mean there are a few hole-in-the-wall type places that look promising but that's about it.  This is your classic hole-in-the-wall burger place that looks like it has been there for forever.  It has a great vibe to it and you can tell it is definitely not a run-of-the-mill franchise.  Anyway, the cashier was very fast and friendly as was the cook.  I ordered a "Mexican Burger" combo and it was delish just like a few of the reviews on here said it would be.  I especially loved the fries.  Perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crunchiness.  The burger/topping had excellent flavor and was a decent size.  Their not-frozen burger patties are cooked on a real grill right in front of you which is nice.  I will definitely return in the future.

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical coming here.  I had no idea what Bosnian cuisine was or where Bosnia was on the map.  However, the pictures and reviews on here quickly eased my worries.  All the reviews on here are spot on.  The food is unique and delicious.  My only complaint was the service.  The hostess/waitress/server/busser (owner?) was very difficult to flag down.  Once you got your meal and beverage - that was it.  You had to lock eyes with her and wave your hands as she scurried around the dining room so she would come over to the table so you could order a refill, order something else, get the check, etc.  The place was pretty dead but it was almost impossible to get her attention even as she passed right by the table.  Very weird.  As we were the only Americans there, it seemed as if we didn't speak the language she didn't really care.  She was very friendly though when we were able to get her attention.  Cevapi = excellent although I'm not a fan of the raw onions Kebab = excellent Pileci = excellent Sirnica = excellent Baklava = sweet and delicious  I thought the food was very unique, delicious and reasonably priced.  The entire experience of trying a new cuisine in a new part of town was worth the drive.  So, all-in-all my dining experience was a good one. If I ever again have a hankering for Bosnian food, I will return.

This place is very interesting.  From the outside it doesn't look like much and definitely a bit sketchy.  I would have never went here if it wasn't highly recommended.  Our party of 5 didn't come here for the large liquor selection upstairs, but rather the bar/lounge/tasting room they have downstairs.  They converted their basement into a cozy little bar area with 4 or 5 small tables surrounded by shelves and coolers of wines and beers.  You are free to peruse their many different bottles then bring your selection to the bar where the bartender will open and pour it for you.  We went on a Saturday night and there were probably never more than 4 or 5 other people down there at any one time.  It is a perfect place to go with friends and try new beers and wines.  I do hear that it gets crowded down there when they do wine tastings though.  The service is friendly, the prices are reasonable and the selection is fantastic so I will definitely be back!

You would think that a VW dealership would have standard tires for a VW CC in stock.       WRONG!  You would think that if the service department says they will order the tire to be ready the next day that it will actually be ordered and be there the next day.       WRONG!  I D I O T S

I've been getting my hair cut here for a few years by Chris Rubino.  She does an excellent job and is reasonably priced.  I highly recommend her.  I also recommend this place if you are a cougar and have lots of extra money to blow on all the "cute" clothing and accessories this place has to offer.  Not only is this place a salon, but it is also a cafe (Crudo is located here and I want to try it someday + there is a great coupon located on local dines http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ) and a store for silly Scottsdale woman's bric-a-brac.  Everything is overpriced and sparkly so I guess I am immune to the cuteness of it all.  I just go to get my haircut then I get the heck out of there.

This place serves excellent pizza and salads.  The price is reasonable for what you get and the service is quick and friendly.  Their wine selection is great but I would stay away from the banana "calzone" thing they offer for dessert.  It looks better than it is, trust me.  Well it would be excellent if it weren't for the dough that gave the whole thing a bitter/salty taste.  I shared the Insaladda della Casa to start then had the Complimenti alla Mamma pizza.  Both were excellent and I would order both of them again.  This was our second trip to Grazie and hope it will not be our last.

Just as I said in my review in February, I returned and had the Insaladda della Casa then the Complimenti alla Mamma pizza.  Just like before, everything was excellent and I would order it again.  I just wish I remembered to read my earlier review before returning so I would be sure to order something different.  All the pizzas sound good and I want to try each one.  The service was very good.  Our waitress didn't seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle.  Their wine selection, by the way, is very good and reasonably priced.  Finally, I must add that sitting inside can be a bit noisy when it is crowded.  Temperature permitting, the patio is a better place to sit, eat and chat.

I got a ride from Benny the other day.  He was prompt and friendly.  Their website is very good as well.  It is straight forward and not shady like some other places.  Also, if the head honcho of Yelp uses Ridesmart then I guess it is good enough for me.

My latest experience proves my theory that all taxi/towncar services are the same.  It is exceedingly difficult to find a consistently reliable service.  After my first experience with Benny and Ridesmart I felt relatively comfortable arranging a ride to the airport.  I was still weary because of past dealings with companies like these so I built in a buffer of time just in case he was late or didn't show at all.  The time of my ride came and went so I decided to give Benny a call to get his status.  He told me that he thought I said "Thursday" instead of "Wednesday" when I made the reservation a day prior.  I was pissed but not surprised because in the back of my mind I knew this would happen and planned accordingly.  He actually called me back several minutes later and said he would be right there because he was "10 minutes away" which is actually taxi speak for half hour.  I declined and drove myself to the airport.  This just goes to show how difficult it is to find reliable transportation when you need it most.  Even if I had called to confirm my ride and/or printed out an email confirmation; there would be no guarantee that he would have showed up.

I  went here Saturday night with a party of 8.  The place was packed as per usual during spring training season but luckily we made a reservation.  They were able to seat us about 30 mins early so that was awesome.  The place does get pretty crowded so be prepared.  * Don's Iceberg Wedge = very good but pretty standard as far as wedges are concerned.  It wasn't anything special.  * Mumsie's Chopped Steak = this thing is awesome.  It is a full pound of meat mixed with pepper and onions.  It was juicy and delicious.  I couldn't even eat 1/2 of it so I took the rest home.  This is definitely a meal to share.  The fries that came with were excellent and seemed to be pretty fresh.  The ambiance is pretty neat even though I couldn't care less about all that sports crap they have everywhere.  Our waitress was pretty good, was fast and friendly, and didn't mess anything up given the large size of our party and how busy the place was that night.  Oh and the highlight of my meal was that the waitress left me with a large crafe of diet coke right off the bat.  It is almost like she knew I would be constantly bugging her for refills.  Although my wife says getting any of the steaks here would be a waste of money and wouldn't be as good as going to "a real steak place", I still would like to give them a shot because most of them sound delicious!    Anyway, it was an excellent meal and I can't wait to return.

True, this place is often crowded, a bit loud, and getting your sushi takes a little while.  Anyway, the sushi is very good and the price is reasonable.  This is the place to go for a few rolls and bombers.  Their happy hour is also very good.

Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, good food.  I have no complaints about this location or with The Keg as a chain in general.  More importantly, my wife has no complaints either which is very rare.  I wouldn't say the food or service here is of Mastro's, Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille quality but its the next best thing.  If you haven't already I suggest signing up for their birthday club thing.  They will email you a certificate good for a free meal to use during the month of your birthday.  It will say you can use it for a steak but you can get the cash value ($23 or something) to use for whatever you want.  Last night my wife and I sat in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour drinks and those awesome potato chips.  The happy hour drink specials for beer and wine are pretty decent but the orange martini thing is way too sweet.  They should just have a regular martini.  Anyway, I had a burger and my wife had a salad with grilled shrimp.  My burger was perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  My wife's salad was very tasty as well and contained 6 or 7 nice size shrimp.  For a side we shared an order of the roasted beets which were fantastic.  The only downside of this place is that it is located in Desert Ridge.  I hate that place with a passion.  It is always so crowded and the layout of the place just sucks.  Just getting in and out of the parking lot can be a clusterfuk.  Whoever designed this place is an idiot.

Here is all I can say about this place:  * Phenomenal ambiance  * Top notch service * Delicious food  Everything I tried was excellent and there wasn't one thing I wouldn't order again.  I could eat a bucket of the mac n' cheese alone.  Chef Beau Macmillian stopped by our table which was awesome.  He really is a great person and excellent chef.  Also, the Edge Bar is one of my all time favorite bars and when the weather is nice I can sit out there all day and all night sipping drinks and enjoying the view.  Can't say enough great things about this place.  I can't wait to return.

Ruth's is easily in my top 5 favorite steak houses.  I've been to Ruth's about a dozen times in my life and it is always fantastic.  I know it is a huge chain and we are supposed to hate them but I don't care.  I would eat there every night if I could.  Sadly, neither my wallet or arteries can afford it.  My reservation for 5 was at 8pm last night and the place was pretty dead.  It didn't matter though because we had a super- special VIP private dining room.  I was poking around their website and found that they have several private dining rooms.  So naturally I NEEDED to have one.  I shot the Scottsdale private dining contact (Michelle) an email to inquire about the possibility of getting their "Ruth's Room" which is their smallest (5-10 people) room.  She responded and told me it was available and would waive the food and beverage minimums which was nice because I didn't even know there were any.  The only thing they forced upon me was a mandatory 20% tip which I normally do anyway so it wasn't a big deal.  Anyway, I provided her all the details (size of party, time, reason for our visit, etc.) all over email so the whole thing went smoothly.  The private room was excellent and well...private.  We closed the door and curtains as to not bother anybody and had a good ole' time.  It is not that we are rowdy or talking about top secret stuff, it was just nice to not have to worry about other people around.  Not that it mattered because the place wasn't too crowded.  Anyway,  I would highly recommend getting the private room if you have a party of 5 or more.   The service was good but not the best.  I could tell they all just wanted to go home or upset that we weren't super big spenders.  Plus I had to wait and had to ask for diet coke refills.  No bueno.  I was also pissed that I told them when I made the reservation that 2 friends in our party had just gotten engaged.  I figured they would send us a dessert with a candle in it or something.  Anyway, they didn't send anything or mention anything.  Oh well.  Guess they forgot.  The food:  * Bread the give you to start = they need to upgrade this.  Every other steak place has them beat in this area.  * BBQ Shrimp appetizer = very good  * Tuna appetizer = very good  * Wedge = eh  * Filet = excellent.  My wife and I split the 12oz..  It was cooked perfectly and was more than enough to share.  I forgot to order it with extra butter but I didn't really need it and my wife would have killed me.  The filet is all I have ever gotten at Ruth's.  Next time I'm going for the ribeye to try something different.  * Creamed Spinach = very good.  Ruth's does it the best.  * Lyonnaise Potatoes = This was my first experience with them.  They are just big french fries with some sauteed onions on top.  It was pretty random but pretty good.  Not sure I would order them again though.  I would probably just stick to regular fries.  All-in-all it was a good dinner.  Not perfect but very good.  I hope to come back soon.

After my first visit I wasn't sure I would be back.  However, we were in the area and decided to give it another shot.  We were in the mood for a good burger so what the heck.  Back in August when we went the place was dead.  There were only like 10 other people in the entire place.  This time however the place was jam packed...both inside and out.  I'm guessing its the snowbirds but I don't know.  We went on a Wednesday and I guess that is the day when they have live music on the patio for a few hours.  They also have some decent drink and appetizer specials if you are interested.  The weather was excellent and the band sounded good so our party of 5 took a table outside.  We shared some chips and salsa, got a few burgers and salads, and listened to the band.  It looks like the same band is there every Wednesday for the rest of the season.  They are an excellent cover band and play some good stuff.  The first time we went here the service was a bit slow.  I thought for sure it would be horrible this time because there were tons more people, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  They had ample wait staff and everything was pretty quick.  I will definitely come again preferably on a Wednesday.

This place has the best Chinese food in AZ.  Sure, I went on Christmas eve so it was a mad house but they managed it wonderfully.  We were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation, our waitress was relaxed and friendly, and the food came out surprisingly fast.  Because it was so busy I was worried about the diet Coke refill situation and was floored by the speed in which they came.    As far as my actual meal was concerned, here are the deets:  * The hot and sour soup was just ok.  It had an interesting smokey flavor that I couldn't quite place.  Also, the soup lacked all the meaty and shrimpy goodness I like in my hot/sour soups.  It wasn't horrible though.  * Their egg roll is the best in AZ hands down.  I've lived here for 15 years and have yet to find one like it.  For some reason egg rolls out west are teeny tiny compared to the ones back east.  Jade Palace nails it.  However, I still yearn for the duck sauce which very very few people who read this will understand.  * Best spare ribs I've ever had.  * The fried rice was interesting as well.  It was made fresh and full of great stuff, but the flavor just wasn't there.  Next time I'm going to add shrimp and pork as well as the chicken to see how that is, but I think Flo's may have them beat on the fried rice front.  * We split 3 other dishes and they were all excellent.  Not overly sauced, fried, or oily, and were full of fresh veggies.  I can't wait to return.

Wow!  Where was this place when I was a kid?  The facility and entire staff were phenomenal.  I may just drop off my 2.5 year old to play and hang out while the wife and I go to the movies.  The best part is that I think they made a positive impression on my son so hopefully he won't throw a fit every time he needs to go to the dentist.  Hopefully, this will translate into good oral hygiene and habits down the line.

Since LA fitness bought out and closed nearly all the Pure Fitness locations convenient to me, I was forced to "join" this gym.  Since I have zero interest (for numerous reasons) in being a part of LA fitness, I decided to cancel my membership so this isn't a typical review.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they couldn't do this for me over the phone.  Instead, they made me go into a physical location.  I was expecting a high-pressure sales pitch to get me to stay but it was a very simple process with no back and forth banter about my reasons for quitting and my LA Fitness can help me reach my goals yada yada yada.  The guy at the front desk simply printed out a form that I had to throw a stamp on and put in the mail.  The whole thing is extremely stupid and a waste of my time because I didn't even have to sign the form.  So 4 stars for wasting my time for something that could easily be done over the phone.  But 4 stars for making it a relatively painless process.

My wife and I were at a wine tasting at AZ Wine and were seated in their bar area.  To our surprise you can order Atlas food as if you were seated in their dining area.  Atlas is connected to AZ Wine so it just makes sense.  Atlas' dining room is very very small and only 15 or so people can fit in the place.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Our table only sampled some appetizers but I can't wait to return to try some main dishes and of course more appetizers.  Here is the rundown:  *bread & butter - the bread was excellent but the butter was weird to me.  I'm sure it was freshly made but it had some type of smoky flavor and weird texture of which I wasn't a fan. *cheese plate - very good, perfect for sharing while wine tasting *crispy penne - it is exactly what the name implies - crispy penne.  lightly fried penne with excellent flavor because of whatever they put on it.  anyway, it was excellent and very unique.  easily my favorite dish.  I could eat plates of the stuff *Schreiner's Italian Sausage - spicy and delicious. *Gnocchi - not your standard gnocchi and very difficult to describe.  however, it was delicious and not overly sauced as they sometimes are.

I have eaten here countless times over the years and somehow this is my first review.  So many reviews and so little time I guess.  Anyway, I can't understand why this particular location has more than a few crappy reviews.  Ra as a chain provides some of the better sushi around and this location is no different.  At some other sushi places you never really know what you are going to get.  This sometimes can be a good thing, but if you want consistently good/fresh tasting sushi at a reasonable price, then Ra is your place.  I honestly have no complaints about Ra's Mill location.  I always get great service and great sushi.  I do agree with a lot of the reviews on here that the music is too loud though.  I really hate having to yell to my table-mates and struggle to hear what they are saying.  I dunno...maybe I'm just getting old.  The decor/bathrooms have pretty much remained unchanged for years and years and could use an update as well.  That's pretty much it for my complaints.  I went here last night at about 8:30ish with a party of 6.  It took a while to get seated but it wasn't too bad.  The place does tend to get crowded so be prepared.  Our waitress was excellent and was quick to refill my diet coke.  We ordered several rolls and some other stuff that I can't remember but it was all fresh and excellent as always.  We spoke to the new general manager (Blake) and he is awesome.  It was nice that he came to our table to make sure everything was ok and offered some excellent recommendations.  He also talked about how he is trying to turn the place around and has replaced some staff and is expecting a total remodel this summer which should be interesting.  Anyway, with or without the changes I will continue to dine here often.

I have been here many many times over the years but this review isn't about those times because I really don't remember them well enough to give a solid Yelp.  Anyway, this review is about their Stein Club.  My wife is a sucker for signing up for clubs that charge a few bucks a year and in return you get membership card and a few perks here and there.  Gordon Biersch has such a club and of course we just had to join.  I mean you get a membership card!  You also get some other misc. perks like reward points when you dine at any GB that you can exchange for some pretty cool stuff provided you spend about $10,000 for food over time.  It is something to strive for I guess.  All kidding aside, there are some really great benefits for being a Stein Club member.  For the membership fee of 20ish dollars per year (I think that's how much it was), you also get invited to free beer tastings, tapping parties, release parties, etc.  They are only for Stein Club members and they give you plenty of beer and tasty appetizers.  There are only about 20 or so members that show up to the Tempe location events so it is not too crowded.  There is always plenty of food and beer to go around.  They normally have their pizzas, garlic fries and wings out.  My favorite are the wings.  Although I may never earn enough points to get some of the cool stuff they offer, I take full advantage of their free food and beer and it is definitely worth the small membership fee.  Yesterday was the pre-release tapping party of their Alt Bier.  The beer was excellent and you could pretty much have all you wanted.  As always Dieter, the head brewer, was there.  He is a super chill guy that basically has the coolest job in the world.  He is at all the events and is pretty much the Yoda of all things beer and is open to answering any questions you may have.  I could have continued to eat the wings, fries and pizza all night but my wife and the other people we were with wanted to order a more proper dinner.  I had the mushroom and swiss burger.  It was a decent size but was ok at best.  The side salad I got was ok too.  I also have to bring up one of their new menu items, the "Housemade Tacos".  Though I did not order or try them, another member of our party did.  When they came out I almost started laughing.  They are honestly the double decker tacos that Taco Bell used to have years ago (or still have, I'm not sure).  The tacos were blue corn taco shells wrapped in a flour tortilla.  WTF!!  Inside the double taco was some kind of fish topped with a real heavy sauce.  That part honestly didn't look too bad, but I just couldn't get over the double taco.

Went there last night for a brewery tour and some Sex And The City 2 thing.  The tour was interesting and Dieter was cool as always.  After the tour my wife and I sat outside to have a beer and some dinner.  I had the wedge salad which was very good and the meat loaf.  The meat loaf was excellent.  They give you a huge portion and I probably shouldn't have eaten it all but I did anyway.  The taste was excellent and the addition of sausage was a nice touch though a bit on the salty side.  The Sex And The City thing was pretty stupid and didn't really mesh with the brewery thing.  They just had some girly drink specials all sponsored by Absolut.  I didn't have anything and I still don't want to see the movie.  I still don't understand why this place doesn't have a regular happy hour.  They have a reverse one which is pretty much useless but I guess it is better than nothing.

I go to this place every couple of months when I'm walking to/from Mill to/from my house which is less than a mile away.  For years I wanted so badly for this place to be my little dive bar down the street where I could walk, get a decent drink then chill and move on.  Instead, this place has consistently been one of the worst bars I have ever been to in my life.  Almost every time I go they hit me up for cover and almost every time I would leave because it is not worth it.  There can be 10 people in the place and some guy hitting bongos on the stage and they would want $5 at the door.  Now I don't mind paying cover at a decent bar with decent acts, decent drink specials and decent service but this place lacks in all those areas.  Anyway, last night (Sunday) my wife and I were walking back from Mill and decided to drop by and see if the place had changed any.  We heard some music coming from their stage and decided that if they were charging a cover we would say f*ck off and leave.  However, to our complete amazement there was no idiot standing by the door to take our money.  We walked right in to the very uncrowded bar and ordered a drink.  I've ordered things other than beer here and it is always a clusterfuc so we ordered a small pitcher of Kilt Lifter which was on special ($7 or something).  They were out of the small pitchers (shocker) so we just got pints.  This was not a surprise because they are always out of something.  We took our beers to the back patio where we played ping-pong and then some bean bag throwing thing for about an hour.  It was fun and nobody bothered us.  Then, as we walked towards the bar to order another drink we basically got shaken down by a hippy guy in a tie dye shirt.  He insisted that we pay him $5 because I guess he took a break from screwing people at the door when we walked in.  We basically told him to screw off then walked home.  Sure we could have paid the $5 but it wasn't worth it and the guy was a complete dick.  I'm all for supporting local bands if they are decent and if I get some kind of value for my dollar.  The Sail Inn is always don't-touch-anything sticky gross, way understaffed, always out of something, etc. so I receive little from going there and supporting this horrible place.    Somebody please buy this place and turn it into a respectable bar.....or just knock it down and make it a parking lot which would at least provide something of value to the area.

Went here for a beer last night against my better judgment because I hate this place more than anything.  This place sucks so much it is funny.  I swear, this place will charge a cover if the radio is on.  And I'm pretty sure the door guy just pockets the money because they are that scummy.  So anyway, last night the door guy tried to shake us down for a few bucks and I decided to cause a scene and he let us in for free so I would stop yelling.  Why would I pay a cover on a dead Monday night at a bar that is gross?  The place was dead but there was a guy singing and playing the guitar.  He was actually very good and I give him credit for playing his heart out in front of 7 people.  Had the ATM not been broken I would have gotten cash to give to him instead of to the door guy that just pockets it.  Oh...and they consider Four Peaks to be an imported beer.  This place has the potential to be really really cool, but whoever runs the place obviously doesn't care.

Although I've never been here, I donate tons of stuff and it probably ends up here.  Once every couple of months I schedule a pickup on satruck.org.  The website is easy to use and you can pretty much pick any day you want to have them pick up your items.  I normally just put the stuff outside my door and they always show up as scheduled to pick it up.  I did have some larger items a few times and they do give you a window of a couple hours during which they will show up to take it out of your house.  They are normally on time but will cry like babies if the stuff is heavy or if there are stairs.  Their pickup people are normally pretty friendly but a few are sketchy.  Part of me wishes that I wasn't so lazy and could sell some of the items on my own because what I donate is worth WAY more than I am allowed to write off of my taxes.  However, I guess it feels good to know that my stuff is being donated to a worthwhile cause.

If you are looking for gourmet Chinese food in a sketchy Tempe strip mall, then don't go here.  However, if you live close by and want some relatively inexpensive, decently tasting and quick takeout Chinese food, then this is your place.  I live about a mile away and this is our go-to place when we want something quick and easy to pickup on our way home from work.  You can call them up, order whatever you want, and within 5-10 minutes it is ready for pickup.  Sure the people who answer the phones there don't speak perfect English and it is difficult as heck to communicate with them sometimes, but this means the food is truly authentic, right?  My wife and I often order the special wonton or the hot and sour soup to go with what we are making for dinner at home.  Once in a while we will get a full meal to take back.  We have discovered that you can order just about any of their non-fried dishes and have them put the sauce on the side.  More Chinese food places should do that because all the dishes are basically just stir fry with different veggies, meat and sauce thrown in.  Anyway,  since we are trying to eat healthy this is a solid option.  I also really like their spare ribs which is probably not the healthiest of options, but oh well.

I wouldn't call this the best pizza ever, but it is very very good.  I've been hearing a bunch of buzz about this place so naturally I needed to give it a shot.  I'm not a big fan of the "sweet" sauce people on Yelp talk about but I'm down for anything.  My wife and I went for an early dinner Friday.  The location of this place is a bit different and we had trouble finding it.  It is in an office building type thing and it is pretty genius how they did it.  We had a little trouble finding it but the cars parked up and down the side of the road was a good indication that we were close.  It is a no-frills place but is actually pretty homey and not cold and stark as you think it would be.  We got there about 6ish and it was already pretty busy.  There were only 1 or 2 free tables.  We were seated promptly and the service was top-notch the entire time.  The pizza:  My wife and I split a small pizza.  It was half the Signature and half of the homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni (both thin crust).  It was more than enough for 2 people.  The crust is almost perfect, not overly sauced, and plentiful cheese and toppings.  It really is some great pizza.  But yeah, I'm not really a fan of the sweet sauce.  * Signature Fresh Spinach = pretty good.  I'm not really a fan of those toppings but I've heard rave review about the pie so I need to get it.  I'm not sure I would order it again but I'm glad I tried it.  * Homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni.  This was excellent pizza!  My wife thought it was a bit oily but its friggin pizza and that's how it should be.  The sausage and peperoni were both delish.  * Margherita = we ordered a lil one of these.  I thought it was very good but my wife loved loved loved it.  The crust was light and airy and the toppings/cheese weren't overkill.  * Mama's Antipasto Salad = eh..ok.  I wouldn't order it again.  Nothing special.  They need a Caesar on the menu.  Anyway, the place is great.  When I feel the need to get carbed out I will return.  I just have to remember to get there early because by 7ish there is a line out the door.  I also wouldn't mind doing delivery and/or their take-and-bake pizza.

I haven't been here for a few years so I decided it would be worth another visit.  I remember going for the cheap saki bombers and sushi back in college.  I've been here 2 times recently and there weren't any notable specials on bombers or sushi.  Had there been some killer specials I might have written a better review, but if you want a better sushi selection, better quality, better service with comparable prices; just go to RA.  The only real upside is that the place is dead most of the time so you get it all to yourself.

I was a 1-800-Flowers man, but it was Saturday morning before Valentine's day and I just couldn't risk them screwing something up like they sometimes do.  So, I used my Googling skills to quickly find a local place that could hopefully get my wife flowers on time the next day.  Luckily I came across Campus Flowers.  Their online ordering process was painless, their selection good and prices reasonable.  They were able to pull it off and deliver the flowers right on time!

This is one of the better restaurants in downtown Tempe.  I came with a rather large party for lunch on Valentine's Day afternoon.  We were seated promptly because it wasn't very busy.  I ordered the 1/2 panini and 1/2 salad lunch special.  I got the butter cup lettuce salad and the meatball panini.  Both were excellent and I would order them again.  The portion size was good and the value for the money was also very good.  The rest of my party ordered the beefsteak tomato panini which also looked very tasty.  This was about the 6th or so time I have eaten at Cafe Boa.  Every time the food and service is excellent.  Their drink specials are excellent though I don't take advantage of them as often as I should living so close by.  I would also highly recommend their sangria; it is fresh and delicious!  The only bad part about going here (or any other place on Mill for that matter) is the horrible parking situation.  If you are lucky enough to find a spot close by, you have to run out and feed the meter ever so often.  However, if you are not so lucky to find a metered spot; you have to drive around to find a lot or garage that they will gouge you for the privilege of parking there.

I have visited Cafe Boa 2 or 3 more times since my last review and all I can say is this place has the BEST skirt steak I have ever tasted!  I have tried to replicate it at home and just can't do it.

I went here for "brunch" on Sunday.  A few things pissed me off because I absolutely love this place for dinner.  * the patio was almost empty yet they sat us almost on top of another group  * they were completely out of fruit  * coffee is $4 and little mimosas are $8  Because I love coming here for dinner I expected and was almost ok with being financially raped because the food is very good.  However, I think their brunch is just a half-assed attempt to make money before dinner time.  The "brunch" food was ok although it was nothing special or memorable.  I relate it to Scottsdale hotel room-service fare without the $17 bowl of cereal or $20 bagel.  If I'm going to have "brunch" aka breakfast and lunch in one meal, I think it should be something substantial.  A buffet perhaps?  I think Caffe Boa should stop using the term "brunch" and start to say "now we have eggs AND salad all on one menu".

This is a very late review, but one I just had to make.  I went here for dinner on new year's eve and it was excellent.  I have come to the conclusion that Caffe Boa is only really good for dinner in my humble opinion.  Everything I have ever tried here is top notch and awesome.  Plenty of rich flavor and sheer good-ness.  Although sometimes their menu scares me because of the prices or ingredients (braised lamb tongue anyone?); I am always surprised how good the food is.  Anyway, I had the linguini with braised shortribs and it was phenominal and will be added to my list of Caffe Boa favorites for sure!

I do not eat here often enough.  This was my 3rd visit and I like it more and more each time.  There was no wait for our party of 4, the service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious.  I have only eaten at a handful of Thai restaurants in my life, but this one is among the best.  We all shared a hot and sour soup to start.  It was very good and plenty for us all.  I like it that you can choose the type of meat and/or seafood to include, but we opted for the tofu.  Next time I would like to get maybe some beef and/or shrimp.  I also like it that you are able to choose the level of spiciness of the soup.  We opted for hot ,but next time I'm going to get it a bit more spicy.  For an entree I ordered the yellow curry with beef made at the "hot" level of spiciness.  It was excellent though next time I am going to get it a bit spicier.  I think it is called "double hot".  Anyway, I licked my plate clean.  The other members of my party ordered equally delicious dishes.  I sampled the Thai fried rice and the Thai Basil (their signature dish) and they were both excellent.  My curry dish was by far the best though.  The bill for 4 people was about $50 before tip which is not bad at all for excellent food, good portions and good service.  I will definitely be back again!

I went here for dinner a few days ago but for some reason didn't read my previous review before my visit so I forgot to order my dish 'double hot'.  I ordered the "Garlic" with beef and brown rice.  I ordered it hot but it wasn't hot enough.  Next time for sure I'm getting double hot.  Anyway, the dish had plenty of flavor, the meet was tender and the veggies fresh.  It was very good and not too unhealthy.  I do have 2 complaints though.  1.  Why can't they get a soda fountain instead of service it in cans?  I drink a ton of diet coke and hate spending like $5 on each can they make me buy.  WTF.  2.  Our meals came out one at a time and I'm not sure why.  10 minutes must have passed between when the first person of our group got their meal and when the last meal was received.  Were they cooked fresh one at a time?  Was our waitress super super busy or super duper slow?  I just don't know.  Anyway, as always, I cannot wait to go back.  I love the food and the service is always pretty good.

What could be better on a stormy night than some spicy Thai food from Thai Basil?  Not much.  I've eaten here several times but this was my first pickup experience.  The lady was a bit difficult to understand on the phone and I wasn't quite sure if she understood me, but the food was ready in 15 minutes and how I ordered it.  * Spring Rolls - Excellent and I loved the sauce.  * Hot & Sour Soup - Excellent because I always custom order it with all the meats and shrimp.  It costs a bit more but it doesn't matter because it is so good.  The only problem is that I ordered it too spicy.  I went with the Thai Hot and it was a bit too hot.  I'm going with medium next time.  *Cashew Nut Sauteed Plate w/ Chicken - excellent and full of good stuff.  I love love love their curry stuff but since I was sharing with my wife I could order it because she prefers regular stir fry stuff.  Anyway, again, I ordered this too spicy as well but no big deal because it was good.  Next time a medium spicy curry dish for me!

This is a fun place for appetizers and drinks if it is not too crowded and the temperature is just right outside.  Otherwise the inside gets way too packed and you have to go outside where it is sometimes way to hot or way to cold depending on what month you go.  I have been here many many times for dinner/drinks/appetizers and have had a good experience every time.  I am not really a fan of most of their food but do enjoy their oysters and their beer.  The service is relatively quick, prices reasonable, and staff fast and friendly as long as it isn't too busy.  However, this review isn't just about sitting outside drinking beers with a few friends.  This is about a very unique experience I had recently.  Until recently I had no idea this place even had an upstairs.  It turns out there are a few small rooms upstairs where patrons can dine.  So, I reserved tables for 10-12ish people that were to join my fiance and I for dinner/drinks for her birthday.  I called a few days prior and they were very friendly and said it wouldn't be a problem.  Upon arrival the night of we were taken behind the bar where a "secret" staircase could be found that leads upstairs.  I have been here many times and had NO idea about those steps or where they led.  Anyway, up the stairs, are 2 what used to be bedrooms converted into dining areas.  Each room had several small tables.  They reserved one of the rooms for my party which was perfect.  They put all the small tables together in the middle of the room and it was more than enough room for everybody.  Our waitress and servers were quick, friendly, and had plenty of stories about the "haunted" 2nd floor.  The food was ok and I should have just stuck with oysters and shrimp but oh well.  I guess its all about the same after a few drinks.  We were upstairs at our table for about 2 hours and they didn't try to rush us out which was good on this busy Friday night.  I could have sat up there longer to avoid the hassle of going downstairs and fighting to get a drink and a table, but my party grew restless.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a picnic table outside and had the "typical" Casey Moore's experience.

This place goes to show you that crooks won't stay in business long.  Their sign is gone and one of their buildings looks empty so it looks like they finally screwed too many people and are moving on or just changing their name or something.  Anyway, I stupidly bought a car there a few years ago.  It was a decent price and they were friendly but that are the only positives I have.  The car was basically a piece of junk which wouldn't have been so bad if the "extended warranty" I bought from Euro was actually from a company that was still in business.  That's right, I bought the extended warranty thing for like 2 grand and never used it because the company went out of business.  Euro Imports kept making excuses and wouldn't give the money back.  Big shocker there.  So, like a fool, I spent tons of cash at their repair shop and the loaner car they promised was non-existent.  All around it was a pain in the ass and I am glad they are out of business.  I have learned my lesson to never again buy a used car at one of those shady places on Scottsdale Road.  Do yourself a favor and go to the dealership.  Right, it may cost you a few extra bucks, but if you are going to get screwed, get screwed by a company won't go out of business in 3 years.  Every single person at Euro Imports was a liar and a crook and I would think twice about hiring any one of them at another dealership.

Finally made it back and the pizza was how I originally remembered it.  Got 1/2 margarita and 1/2 with sausage and jalapenos (I can't remember the name).  Anyway, it was EXCELLENT and easily one of my favorite pizzas in the valley.  It could have been a BIT more crispy and not way overpriced but it was excellent nonetheless.  Last time the pizza was soggy but this time they totally redeemed themselves.  I hope to be back soon.  Oh and the prosciutto wrapped asparagus was just eh.  The service was also pretty good/friendly for a Friday night but clearly overworked.

This is the QT I visit most frequently.  I actually go out of my way to visit QTs because I feel they are superior to all other gas stations in AZ and I'm not even talking about the price of the gas.  I'm talking about the friendliness of the staff, the good selection of stuff in the store, and the general good vibe of the place.  The place is always well lit and I especially like that pumps are rarely ever out of order.  Another plus is that in general all QTs are more "roomy" than other stations which lets cars maneuver more easily.

I really like this place and have no idea why the reviews are so crappy.  If you people want Mexican food then go to a Mexican place.  If you want better quality chicken, go to Bandares or Houstons or the tons of other places that serve good quality stuff and don't bitch about the price or that its in Scottsdale.  While some places rip you off, you pay for what you get for the most part.  Anyway, rant over.  Chuy's is very good.  It is neither a Mexican or a chicken joint.  It is some sort of Baja cuisine that I don't really understand but I really like.  I don't really like the ordering process here.  There is no overhead menu so I'm always unsure where to stand to place my order.  Lucky for me, right when i walk in the door, a person is right there asking what I want.  Not 2 seconds after I walk into the place I already feel flustered.  I'm handed a menu and stand to the side to make my decision.  All I really wanted was 3 or 4 of their fish tacos because they are awesome.  I didn't want all the rice and beans and stuff that comes with the 2 taco meal but I couldn't find the single tacos on the menu.  Oh well....I settled on the tri-tip and chicken meal because I could feel everyone staring at me wanting me to place my order.    I've gotten that same meal before and it is excellent.  Not the highest quality or the healthiest meal around, but I don't care...it is darn good.  You get a 1/4th of a chicken and a good amount of tri-tip stuff.  It's actually a good amount of grub.  As I was waiting for my order I found the single fish tacos on the menu.  Not worth like $3/taco but I'm for sure getting a few of those next time I return.  They are really that good.  Especially with their special sauce stuff.  The help yourself chip and salsa bar is also pretty good.  Above average I'd say.  Plenty of most-of-the-time fresh chips and plenty of most-of-the-time fresh salsas.  The salsas are ok but can use some more kick.  Anyway, yeah, the place is probably not so clean and everything is sticky.  There are also tons of random California junk lining the walls but that is all part of this place's charm.  There are a lot of Chuy haters out there but I don't care.  I will return.

Phoenix is not the place to find good Chinese food.  However, Wong's has some of the best in the area.  Their prices are reasonable and service is friendly.

My wife and I went here for dinner last night.  It was a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  Somehow I've never been to this location before and it is pretty run down and old but you still get the good ole Macayo's charm.  There are signs all over the place saying they are going to remodel the place this month so that will be nice.  The food was pretty good and exactly what you'd expect.  Not the best, not the worst.  You get some decent Mexican food at a decent price.  The best part is that I scored a Local Dines gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and my meal was basically free.  Our waiter was very good, fast, and friendly.  He kept my diet cokes coming like clockwork which was awesome.

You can't beat the deal on Local Dines (http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ )!  A $40 certificate for $20.  This was my first visit to this location because I always used to go to the one on Mill.  I LOVED going there and it is a shame they aren't there anymore because the place had a great vibe to it and had excellent food.  This Bamboo club has the same great food, but you could tell the place is getting pretty old and needs some updating.  None of this mattered to me because I was there for one reason:  the orange beef with that crispy spinach.  Soooo frikking good.  Its like candy.  I also love the fried rice because it is full off good stuff.  The service is also pretty good as are the martini pours.  I will return hopefully soon.

I have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  My search has put this place on the top of my list.  After years of waiting I finally  was able to dine at the famed Delmonico Steakhouse in Vegas.  I was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.  My wife and I arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  The ambiance while very nice, was not what I had expected.  It was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered up my usual (Goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  We chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.  First we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  We settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.  First they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  I liked it that they brought you a single roll so I couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so I really didn't want more than one.  Probably for the best though.  For an appetizer we shared the gulf shrimp cocktail which was excellent.  The shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  They give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although I could have eaten them all myself.  If you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.  Then we had the Caesar  salad which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  While the salad was pretty good, I wouldn't order it again.  They add some spices to it that I just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.  As per our steakhouse usual, my wife and I split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  It wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  The steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender I am looking for.  At 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.  For sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the fingerling potatoes.  I guess they were pretty good but I should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like creamed spinach or mashed potatoes.  My wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time I'm ordering something good.  My wife and I are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  It was ok but I would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  I wasn't a fan of the crust but I was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.  After dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason I had absinthe.  The after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  I asked if I could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  Instead, I settled on one and it was very good.  I am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so I really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  I still have no idea why the heck I ordered it.  My entire Delmonico experience was excellent.  Our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  The price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  Anyway, I would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.

This is one of my favorite burger places in town.  I would definitely give this place 5 stars if they took reservations and made the place a bit bigger.  It seems like no matter what time you go, on what day, or with how many people; you end up waiting 20 minutes for a table where you end up practically sitting on the person next to you because they cram the tables so close together.  They own the space next door where they sell things to-go and cupcakes.  I can't understand why they don't just knock down the wall and make the actual restaurant bigger.   Anyway, I go there for the food and not the cramped space or wait time....  I have been there about a dozen times now and all I ever get is the Delux Burger.  I make it a lettuce wrap because I am trying to limit the carbs.  Though every time I end up eating the thing with a fork because the lettuce wrap proves to be too messy.  Even without the bun the burger is excellent.  Next time I am feeling adventurous and skinny, I shall order it with the bun.  Anyway, it is pricey for a burger, but excellent none the less.  Since I don't eat the burger's bun, it makes sense in my head to scarf down as many of the sweet potato fries as I can.  Those fries are simply phenomenal and secretly the reason I go there.   I just can't get enough of them and their aioli.  The regular fries are also excellent.  Delux is an expensive burger joint but well worth it.  The service is quick and friendly once you get seated and the food is always excellent.  Their beer selection is also very good.

I went here last night with a party of 9.  I've been here several times before but this was the first time I got their private room.  If you want some extra room (they tend to really pack people in the main dining area) and if you want to make a reservation so you don't have to wait for a table (they don't take reservations); the private room is the way to go.  It seats about 10 people but the catch is that you have to spend at least $200 which normally isn't a problem if you go with more than a couple people.  The room itself is kinda cool but you can totally tell it is their office/conference room thingy.  They should really clear it out of all the office junk and make it more of a dining room thing.  It was pretty cool anyway.  Very private and quiet.  The salads, burgers and fries were excellent as always.  The sweet potato fries were a bit raw/undercooked which pissed me off but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to complain.  Our waiter was very friendly, quick and accommodating to our large party.

I just went here for lunch.  I really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up.  It gets crowded, the ordering process is a clusterfuk, they place looks sketchy and dirty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, yada yada.  The place isn't worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique.  Its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine, but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot.  * Jerk Chicken = very good * Pollo Diablo = spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later * Jade Red Chicken = excellent * Pork Fried Rice = very good * Red Salsa Stuff = excellent * Refried Beans = standard * Snickerdoodle Cookie = awesome

This was my first dim sum experience so I didn't really know what to expect.  I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed but my party of 2 was seated promptly.  A few minutes after being seated the carts started coming around with lots of interesting food selections.  We were initially a bit flustered because we really had no idea what most of the food was or the price of it.  The carts came around pretty quickly and we were politely offered what they had.  The only problem is that the servers really don't speak very much English and we don't speak any Chinese, so it was difficult to know exactly what all the food on the cart was.  The place was noisy and filled with hungry people and we didn't want to complicate things by asking about every little thing, so we resorted to the "point at random stuff" method.  This worked well but I'm sure we missed out on some good food we didn't even know about.  I am generally not too thrilled about the Chinese food here in Phoenix, but this place probably serves some of the most authentic.  There seemed to be tons of Asian customers there so I take that as a sign that the food is pretty good as well as authentic.  At about $35 for 2 people it was a bit pricey for lunch, but well worth it because it was a very unique experience coupled with excellent food.  I would like to go back soon now that I know what to expect.  I also hear the food off the menu is excellent so I would like to return to give it a shot.

Gelato is one of my favorite desserts and this is my favorite place to get it.  I HATE this place when it gets crowded though.  I was there last night with a group of 5 and somehow it was dead which was great.  I didn't feel rushed to make my order or feel bad when I wanted to taste everything first.  The staff is always very nice about it but the long line of people behind you may not be so friendly.  Anyway, my gelato was excellent as always.  I've never really had bad gelato ever, but this place churns out some awesome stuff.  I hope to come back soon and often.

This place really isn't so bad in the "off season".  I went there last night with a party of 4.  The wait wasn't terrible and the patio was perfect.  It wasn't too hot, too cold and it wasn't too crowded.   I didn't get my usual beef burger and opted for the tuna burger instead.  It was just good...not excellent or outstanding.  I did however order my usual wedge salad (chopped of course) and it was very good as always.  I'm starting to think that the real star entrees there are the tacos.  Two people in my party ordered them and the dishes looked amazing.  I am for sure getting the steak ones next time.  The service was pretty good as always.  Oh one last thing.  They give you a little chocolate cookie when you walk out the door.  It is a very nice touch, but for some reason they add a bunch of salt to them.  I don't understand it but I think adding salt to sugary things (like cookies and ice cream) is some kind of fancy-pants trend that needs to go away ASAP.

The in-laws are in town so that means a visit to Chelsea's.  Our party of 7 rolled in at about 8ish and there was a bit of a wait but not as bad as it has been before.  The parking lot wasn't too full either which meant no forced valet.  This time I tried the Chelsea's Cheeseburger and it was very good.  Still no LGO burger though and the fries are still weird and eh'.  I also ordered the chopped wedge and it was still excellent and still the best around.  I still haven't ordered their tacos yet but I did try my wife's.  She ordered the ribeye steak ones.  They were excellent and I think I want them next time.  As always the service was pretty fast and friendly.

Inexpensive heaps of awesome goodness.  What more can I say?  I love piling my bowl high with tons of meat, veggies and noodles then smothering it in my own concoction of sauce.  I literally can't get enough of this place and wish there were more around the valley.

Update:  The Chandler location gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for our next visit.  The coupon was clearly marked with the Chandler location, but we figured what the heck and tried to use them at the Scottsdale location.  We thought they weren't going to accept them, but to our amazement they did.  It just goes to show that some businesses really do care about customer service.  And btw the food and service was just as good as the first time.

I went here with a party of 8 last week.  This was my first trip to this location and it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  I think the Express in Tempe is bigger.  It doesn't matter though...I was just making a comment.  Anyway, for a chain of Greek joints, MBFGR churns out some pretty respectable Greek food.  And this location isn't any different.  I know its not the best or the most authentic, but it does the job.  Their servings are generous, prices reasonable and service excellent.  Even though I was in a party of 8, the service was very fast and friendly.  It helped that the place was not very busy at all for a Sunday evening.  We ordered 3 of those shared meat platter things and it was excellent.  There was more than enough food for 8 people with some to spare.  If you are going with a bunch of people and want to try something a bit different than this is the way to go.  You get a giant plate of Greek goodies for a reasonable price.  The only problem I have is with the calamari we ordered as an appetizer.  They give you like 7 pieces of calamari mixed with a ton of fried onion strings.  WTF.  It LOOKS like you are getting a decent amount of calamari but when you look closer it is more like a pile of onion stuff.  Lame.

My wife and I dined here last night.  It was dead.  We were there for about an hour and were the only people there.  A few people came and went for pickup orders but that is it.  It was like our own private dining room.  We were assured by the owner that during the winter months the place is almost always jam packed with snowbirds.  From the looks and deadness of the place I was skeptical of the food/service but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was awesome and so was the service.  The owner was friendly and an all around awesome lady.  To start we had baba ganoosh and hummus.  Both were very good and the pitas were ok but not house made.  Then we had a small house salad and lentil soup.  The lentil soup was excellent but the salad was just ok.  The dressing was 'eh and weird and I really can't describe it.  However, for a small salad, it was huge.  For my main course I ordered the lamb and gyro dish.  The lamb was tender and juicy and the gyro was the best I've ever had.  The portion was huge too which was good because I was able to eat the rest for lunch the next day.  My wife had the falafel salad.  The actual salad part was just ok (like the house salad I ordered previously) but the falafel were excellent.  It was also a very big portion.  For desert we brought home some baklava.  It was homemade and very good although not as sweet as I would have liked.    All-in-all it was a very good dining experience and we will return.

I have had 3 experiences with Bobby Q's.  I have eaten there once, and picked up their food twice.  Driving past their location on the freeway it looks like an interesting yet typical bbq place.  However, once you walk in, you will find that Bobby Q's is more upscale than you would think.  The inside is very nice and definitely the nicest bbq place I have ever seen.  As for the food, it is excellent!  The brisket is the best I have ever tasted.  The bbq chicken, fries, and macaroni n' cheese are up there as well.  I would like to try more things (like the ribs), but I just can't get enough of the brisket.  The corn bread is also worth a try as are those lil' donuts they give you at the end of your meal.  The donuts are made fresh and  are definitely not the healthiest thing you can have, but omg they are fried magic for your mouth!  My experience with the service is that it is always fast, friendly, and helpful on both my dine-in and take-out experiences.  I honestly can't wait to eat here again!

Once again Bobby Q's brisket does not disappoint!  I went there today with 5 other people from my office at about noon.  It wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly.  They seem to know that time is short during workweek lunch hours so they were very quick in taking our orders.  I am always shocked whenever I go just how quickly orders arrive at the table.  I ordered the BBQ brisket plate (as always) with fries as a side.  I still love their brisket and think its the best in town and actually the best I've ever had.  I was in a french fry mood so I didn't order the mac n' cheese which I also think is some of the best around.  I also LOVE those lil donuts they give you at the end!  Can't wait to go back!

My wife and I went here last night (Thursday) at about 7pm.  The place was pretty dead which was good because I don't like crowds or waiting a long time for my food.  The decor of the place is pretty much how all the other reviews on here describe it.  It really is a neat little "sushi cafe".  I didn't much like the ordering process but I guess that is where the "cafe" part comes in.  You aren't seated, given a menu, then free to check little boxes on a piece of paper to let them know what sushi you want.  Instead, you walk up to the counter, look at a menu, and give your order right there.  I felt rushed to give my order as if somebody was behind me waiting to place theirs but there wasn't.  Our cashier/waitress was very nice and patient though.  *Sake Bomber = solid and not bad for $6  *Octopus Salad = gross and I couldn't eat it.  I was expecting something like what they have at RA but it was far from it.  Instead, it was slices of octopus that tasted super fishy and really nasty.  *Edamame = standard  *4 random rolls = pretty good but not outstanding.  We didn't order any crazy rolls though.  I still think Ra/Kona are much better for some reason.  I guess its because I think the fish is fresher at the larger more popular places.  I'm really not the biggest fan of strip-mall sushi places, but the sushi here was ok and not bad at all.   Anyway, I wasn't expecting this place to be as decent as it was.  I'm not sure I am going to rush back though.  However, if I lived across the street I would be there all the time.  We used a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate we got for like $5 or something so it wasn't a bad deal.  I would highly recommend giving this place a shot but get one of those certificates first.  Oh, and with the certificate they add an additional 18% gratuity which is a bit weird because you wouldn't think you get service because you order everything at the counter.  You actually DO get service because the cashier/waitress brings you your food, clears your plates, and does the other stuff that standard waitresses do, so they deserve a tip.

Somehow I've been here about a dozen times over the past couple years and this is my first Yelp of the place.  I guess I am slipping....  Anyway, I went here last night for dinner with a party of 6 at about 7pm.  As usual the parking is a clusterfuk so I valeted it.  It wasn't as jam-packed as I've seen it before so it only took about 15-20 mins to get a table which I guess is about normal at least when I go.  Aside from the parking, wait and loudness of the place I really have no complaints.  I LOVE the food especially the green chili burger.  Its soooo good.  Great flavor and juiciness combined with the slight spiciness of the chill topped with tons of cheese makes for an excellent burger.   I always order it sans bun and have never got it on the LGO English muffin but I swear someday I am going to do it.  I do however eat the fries.  Don't ask...it makes sense in my head.  I have eaten a few of their pizzas but it was so long ago that I don't really remember anything but the fact that they were excellent.  The prices are reasonable, portions large and service very good.  I will be coming back again and again.

Went here last night with a party of 5 at about 7pm.  I've never seen the place so uncrowded before.  It was great.  Didn't have to wait 30 mins for a table.  Parking still sucked though.  I got my usual.  The green chili burger without the bun but instead of fries I got the Caesar.  The salad was just eh and I should have ordered the corn instead.  Next time.  Anyway, the burger was very good.  I still have no idea why it just doesn't come with ketchup on the side and you have to ask for it instead.  The service pretty much sucked.  Our waiter wasn't very attentive and 2 out of the 5 orders were screwed up.  The manager came by to say sorry and said the 2 meals were comped.  That was nice.  The waiter also gave us a piece of the red velvet cake which was also very nice because the red velvet cake is excellent and some of the best around.  ** Update 5/16/10 **  I received a "compliment" about my review above.  It said, "F*ck you douche bag".  Not sure who it was but I politely said I don't swing that way and thanks for the offer.  The guy probably works there and just has a Yelp account to send random emails.  Anyway,  I am flattered.

I'm not going to lie, I have been here about 6 more times since my last review and it is really starting to grow on me.  The place is always clean, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always helpful, friendly and pretty speedy.  Also, aside from the prosciutto and melon pizza; they are all very good.

This place is excellent!  Here is my run down:  * Hot Goat Cheese and Wild Mushroom Arugula Salad - I split this with my wife.  While it was very good, I wouldn't recommend splitting it because it wasn't that big.  I'm really not a big fan of frou- frou salads either so next time I'd like to try the wedge or Caesar.  * Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Saut√©ed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree, GingerSoy Jus - OMG!  This was an awesome dish.  Nice big ahi steak cooked perfectly along with those wasabi potatoes.  Holy cow sooooo good!  Awesome combination and oh so yummy.  *Crab Fried Rice with Scallions and Mushrooms = Awesome  * Crisp Parmesan and Truffle French Fries = Wow  * Truffled Macaroni & Cheese = I didn't get this but it sounds great and I'm definitely gonna try it next time  * Saut√©ed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots - eh...I guess it was ok for spinach.  Anyway, I can't wait to go back.  The ambiance is excellent and so is the service.  The prices are pretty much in line with what you would expect for a trendy seafood place in the area.  Next time I go I'd like to check out their happy hour which is supposed to be very good.

I've been to the cafe for lunch about a dozen times (much more than my number of check-ins would suggest) and each time it was consistently good.  However, I've never had the pleasure of dining inside the actual restaurant until Friday.  The service, food, and decor are all top notch.  Although the price of my entree was ridiculous in my opinion ($26 for 3 shrimp atop risotto), everything else was excellent.  The bread and pesto they give you to start is phenomenal, the lamb meatballs are tender and delicious as was the tzatziki, and the shrimp and risotto was perfect as well.  The margherita flat bread was just ok and we should have opted for one not as basic.  Next time for sure.  My only advice is to either make a reservation or come early.  The place fills up fast around dinner time but 6:30 is a safe bet for early-birds without a reservation.  Also, the better the weather the more prime the real estate on the patio so get there super early to reserve your spot out there.

My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary here Saturday night.  We decided to pull out all the stops and do the "The Brick Oven Table" thing.  They setup a nice table outside next to their brick oven and serve you an 8 course meal.  It is very intimate and if I wasn't already married my wife would have thought I was going to propose.  So if there are any guys out there looking for a good proposal spot this is probably a pretty solid place to do it.  It probably wasn't my most brilliant idea to sit outside because it was pretty hot and both of us got pretty bitten up by mosquitos and/or ants.  The hostess and waitress gave us plenty of forewarning and chances to move inside because of the heat, but we decided to stick it out because it is all part of the charm and will definitely give us an anniversary to remember.  Anyway, the food was very very good.  I can't pick a favorite because it was all good.  Yes the courses are pretty small but after 8 courses I was pretty stuffed.  Nothing that was served was overly bizarre or fru fru (as some tasting menus can get).  My only complaint is that the chef has a pretty heavy hand when it comes to salt.  I mean I love salt but some of the stuff was overly salted.  Doing the sampling menu was a great experience and gave us the full range of what Quiessence has to offer.  It truly is top notch cuisine.  Everybody from the hostess to the waitresses to the bus boys are all very professional, helpful and friendly.  I would recommend Quiessence to anybody looking to celebrate an occasion or just want a nice night out.

A few friends are regulars here and can't stop talking about this place so my wife and I joined them last Saturday night at about 7pm.  It was pretty dead and we had our choice of table.  The decor is pretty interesting but is pretty typical of a Greek place.  *Pitas = Wow.  Excellent.  No idea if they are homemade though but they come fresh and warm.  They will also give you as much as you want on the house. *Saganaki Flambeau = Flaming Cheese = I love food/drinks that are on fire.  This dish was pretty good and just like at other Greek places. *Fried Calamari = Pretty good.  There was some kind of sauce (butter and lemon?) on it that I'm not so sure about but it was pretty good. *Soup = All meals come with this.  It is pretty good.  It is some type of lemon chicken soup. *Salad = All meals also come with this.  It is a small and standard Greek salad.  It was ok. *Dimitri's Leg = tender and tasty.  Didn't really taste like lamb though.  I could have sworn it was brisket.  Comes with a little bit of veggies and potatoes.   Overall I thought the food was just good.  Most of the dinner menu looks to be higher end Greek fare (I think) with the owner's special twist, so next time I think I'm going to go with some Greek classics such as a gyro, mousaka, etc. so I can get a true feel of this place.  The real star of this place is the owner/waiter/server, George.  This guy is a real character and I think is on crack.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see him.  Anyway, he is a real nice guy, is very talkative, has some pretty good stories and you can tell he really loves his restaurant.  He even gave us a drink on the house at the end of our meal.

My wife and I have been here about a half dozen times and is one of our favorite little bars in Phoenix.  We always try to stop by when we are on one of our self-made light rail dinner/pub crawls like we had last weekend.    The Roosevelt is pretty much just a neat little older home converted into a bar.  There are a bunch of tables and chairs scattered throughout the "home's" rooms.  It is all very laid back and cozy.  They have a pretty good beer and wine selection as well.  My absolute favorite is the Rogue Hazelnut Brown they have on tap.  OMG sooo good!  That is pretty much all I get when I go.  Anyway, this was our last stop of the evening so the place was a bit crowded.  This place gets super crowded so get there early if you want a place to sit.  I am not a real super huge fan of standing at a bar so sometimes The Roosevelt ticks me off in that regard, but I guess good for them for being so popular.  Luckily during this visit we only had to stand for about 1/2 hour then I was able to quickly pounce when people left from their table.  My anger about standing for so long quickly faded away and The Roosevelt once again became a great little bar to have a few beers, chit-chat and people watch all from a comfy chair.

This is a pretty chill place if you want to grab a few drinks with your friends and relax.  The place has a really good vibe to it.  I heard some good things about it so I figured I would give it a try for dinner.  We went on a Monday night at about 7:30ish and it was not very crowded.  We sat at a booth inside because it was still a bit cool outside.  The patio is nice with lots of seating and I would like to come back and relax outside with a few drinks in the future.  For an appetizer we initially ordered their grilled hot wings, but it turns out they are fried for some reason before they are grilled.  I don't understand why they say "grilled" when they are grilled AND fried.  Anyway, the other 2 members of my party don't do fried foods so we didn't order them.  Other patrons at another table had them and they did look good tho.  We ordered our meals and a side of their sweet potato fries to share.  I forgot to say we wanted them with our meals so they brought them out before (I still don't understand why people in Arizona like having a side of fries before their meals...).  We told them to please take the fries back because we wanted them with our meals.  Our waitress looked at us funny then took them back.    We waited another 10 minutes for our salad to arrive but ended up asking our waitress about it because we were getting hungry.  She got confused again and thought that we told her to serve our salad with our main courses (and the fries).  5 minutes later we had our meals with the fries AND our salad.  I ordered the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake.  It was very unique and very good.  I would definitely order it again.  I also tried the grilled salmon which was also very very good.  The sweet potato fries were ok and the dipping sauce they served with them was just weird.  The Caesar salad was also just ok.  The portion sizes were good as was the quality of the food.  The prices I thought were a bit high for what you get, but it wasn't too bad.  For 3 of us to eat it was about $80 without alcohol.    I think I would come back when I am in the mood to shoot the breeze for a few hours, have 4 or 5 drinks and try some interesting food.  I hear they have a pretty good happy hour so that would be interesting to check out.

Ocean Club, along with all the other restaurants in the Mastro's group, is as good as it gets.  While pricey, the service, decor, food and selection are all top notch.  I have eaten at all of the Mastro's restaurants several times and you just can't go wrong with any of their food.  However, I seem to always go towards the filet along with any of their delicious side dishes.  This time I tried the crab gnocchi and it was great.

If you like cell phone stores/kiosks or urban clothing crap then this is your place.  There is really not much else of value here.  There are only about 7 stores in the entire place and the rest is vacant.  Although once in a while I have to go during my lunchtime at work to pick up something random and the place is dead so it is quick & easy to get in & out.

I have lived down the street from this place for almost 5 years and have driven by hundreds of times and not given it a second thought.  I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as "calzones filled with awesomeness".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.  With my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!  My only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.  Our new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.    Also, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy.

I have lived in Tempe for almost 15 years and have somehow never been here.  Sure, I knew it was there and have walked passed it dozens and dozens of times.  I was always curious about what the theater was and what type of movies it played.    Is the place even open anymore?  Does it only play artsy fartsy type movies? Is the theater totally outdated?  Can you buy tickets at that cool little booth thing out front that you only really see in movies?  These are some of the questions I asked myself every time I passed, but never thought much about it after it was out of sight.  That is until I was poking around some events on Yelp and found a movie that I wanted to see, Blood into Wine, was going to be showing.  I quickly bought 2 tickets online early in the week to be picked up at will call before the movie.  A pretty painless process.  My wife and I went to the 8:15 showing last night (Saturday) and I was super excited to see the movie as well as visit a cool little theater.  Upon our arrival I was a little upset that they didn't take and/or sell tickets at that booth out front.  Oh well.  So we went inside and were met by real friendly staff at the concession stand like you would find at just about any other Harkins only 1/100th the size.  We were early so we just picked up our tickets and went for a little walk around Mill.  When we returned to the theater I couldn't figure out who to give our tickets to so we just walked right in to their single theater without showing proof that we actually paid for a ticket.  I guess you don't really need tickets when you go there.....  They only sold about 60 out of a possible 200 tickets but I'm not sure if that is normal or not.  It was good for me though because I don't like to sit right next to a random person.  We picked 2 seats near the back with almost nobody around.  Prefect!  Anyway, the movie was excellent and so was the theater.  You wouldn't think it by looking at the outside of the theater, but the inside has been updated as has been the screen/projector and sound stuff.  It was a typical Harkins movie going experience.  The only difference being the type of movies that are played there.  I will definitely go again if I hear about a decent movie they are showing.  The only downfall of this place and it really isn't their fault, is the parking situation on or by Mill.  It can be tough to find nearby/free parking near the theater.

Love this place.  Great food, large portion sizes, great service, and reasonable prices.  All Big Fat Greeks are pretty much the same to me and I love them all.  I know its not hoity toity fancy schmancy, but I don't care.  I enjoy prompt service, large portions of good food, and consistency and this place delivers all 3.

This was my 3rd time here and I'm really starting to like this place.  I really like the decor which is pretty dimly lit, modern, etc.   It has a really nice vibe and looks almost exactly like Houstons.  The service was excellent, the food came out quickly and everything was very tasty.  Here are the highlights I would go back for in an instant:  * Grilled Artichokes - they were excellent and so was the aioli they serve it with * WGC Bacon Blue Cheese Salad - excellent and even the "side" salad portion was sizable * Honey Roasted Carrots - I never thought I would actually like to eat carrots but these were phenomenal and an excellent side * Corn Salad - this was also an excellent side.  Fresh cut corn off the cob with some other stuff in a light dressing.  Very very good.  I ordered some steak thing that was a special.  It wasn't memorable so next time I'm going to stick to what is on the regular menu.  My wife ordered the trout and it was excellent.  I have to say thought my favorite was their bread pudding.  Wow.  Just Wow.  I want that for dinner next time.

I sometimes come here for random household stuff.  The place is always absent of customers and has way to many sales associates roaming about with nothing to do.  I am honestly pretty shocked that this Sears still exists.  Anyway, on my last visit to peruse the grills, I had an awesome customer service experience.  I hardly ever write about this type of thing but in this case I feel I need to.  My wife and I are new to gas grills so we had no idea where to start.  Along came Bryan Costello.  He was super friendly, personable, knowledgeable and just all around awesome.  He brought us up to speed on the ins and outs of gas grilling and all the grills that Sears has to offer.  The crazy part was that Bryan suggested we come back the next day (when he wasn't even working) because some grills were probably going to be discounted further.  This was odd for somebody to say that is on commission but I value his honesty.  Long story short we purchased a grill from Bryan that day even though it may have been a few bucks cheaper the following day.  I also have to point out their order pickup process.  You enter a room and scan your receipt at a kiosk.  Your name pops up on a screen that has the status and a the time you have been waiting.  On another wall it says that if you wait longer than 5 minutes you get a coupon for your next visit.  As the time counted I could hear the warehouse people in the background yelling to hurry up so they wouldn't miss the 5 minute goal.  They really do have their act together but it took like 7 minutes which is no big deal.  I hope nobody got in trouble.

Awesome happy hour.  $5 cocktails and $5 appetizers.  The best part is that there must have been about 7 food items and 15 drinks to choose from.  All well worth 5 bucks a pop.  The tenderloin skewers and sliders were standouts.  Service was excellent all around.  Get there early to snag a table.  If I lived closer I would be a regular.

My wife and I went here last night with another couple at 7pm.  Thankfully we had a reservation which gave us a perfect outside table.  The weather was perfect and there was live music so it was great.  The place looks like it gets pretty busy around dinner time so it is probably best to make a reservation if you have a larger party.  I honestly wasn't expecting this place to be as good as it was.  I just didn't think a wine bar in Mesa would serve up the caliber of food this place does.  Almost all the food was excellent and better than just about any wine bar/bistro place I've been to in the valley.  The lamb pops appetizer were rubbed in awesomeness and were perfectly tasty.  And the flat iron steak & polenta were fantastic.  The steak was cooked perfectly, was tender and juicy, and had a great sauce on top.  The polenta was a great compliment.  The homemade peach cobbler for dessert was also excellent and perfect to share.  The only thing I didn't care for was the bruschetta.  It was pretty weak.  Very thin slices of bread with 'eh toppings with ok flavor.  I was expecting much better.  The service was very friendly but they really need more people during peak times because they clearly have too many tables to tend to.  I can't wait to return as they have many other items on the menu I would like to try.

My wife and I were invited to a wine tasting here last night.  It is a fun little place with a large selection of wines at good prices.  They have a decent selection of beers and high-end wines as well.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  The awesome part was that you can order food from Atlas and eat it in the bar area.  Atlas has perfect food for wine tasting so it was a perfect fit.  I will return.

The wife and I were looking for something low-key and random to do on Halloween so we gave this place a try.  It was pretty early (8ish) so the place wasn't very busy at all.  That was a good thing because this ensured we could sit wherever we wanted and there was nobody playing that shuffleboard game thing they have.  I LOVE that game!  We had a few reasonably priced drinks while we played then ordered some burgers.  Their burger selection is surprisingly good with tons of topping to choose from.  You really wouldn't expect it from a "dive" bar.  Our burgers were big and juicy and tasted excellent.  I don't think they were pre-made and frozen, but if they were, kudos to the defroster!  The service was excellent as our waitresses were fast and friendly.  For some reason we had 3 different waitresses during the 3 or so hours were were there, but it was ok.  I have to give a shout out to the waitress that took our food order because she brought me a pitcher of diet coke so I could refill it myself.  AWESOME!!  When I eat I somehow drink tons of diet coke and it is always a pain for the waitress to keep on refilling and a pain to wait for another one.  Anyway, we didn't even get to that point because she brought the pitcher right away.  It was like she knew me!  Very impressive!  The price was very reasonable for what we ordered and we had fun.  It seems like most of the people who hang out there are regulars so they are pretty friendly.  We even made some new friends when they challenged us to shuffleboard for drinks.  Good stuff!!

My company was sent a box of their cookies as a holiday gift.  Their Pineapple Coconut cookie was the best cookie I've ever had.  Yeah, Yelp 5-star good.  I wish I had more to say, but this is it for now.

The light rail pretty much saves me from drinking and driving and/or having to deal with parking downtown.  Knowing that I can pretty much get off at any stop, walk a few blocks, and find some new and interesting bars and restaurants, really excites me.   Makes me feel so hip and urban.  Sure there are plenty of shady people on the thing at all times but that is all part of its charm.  I've been on the light rail during some pretty odd hours and I haven't been shanked or robbed yet so that's a plus.  I can't wait for the thing to expand to other parts of the valley.  The construction will suck but it will be worth it.  They also need to figure out a way to have "express" routes.

I bought an $80 gift cert for $40 a while back and have been dying to use it and finally was able to drag my wife here.  I got the certificate on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) - honestly their coupons are the best thing ever and SOOOO worth it.  No restrictions like on Restaurant.com.  After navigating their clusterfuk of a parking situation (you'll see what I'm taking about if you come from the east side of the street) we valeted the car and headed to the bar.  It is a pretty classy joint and we were the youngest people in there by several decades.  I like that because it means it will be quite and the service is good in a place that caters to an older crowd.  I was correct on both accounts.  Anyway, my wife had a glass of wine and I had an excellent vodka martini with excellent blue cheese olives.  The bartender was fast and friendly.  Anyway, here is what I had:  * Wedge Salad - I listened to my wife and ordered it with thousand island dressing which was stupid because I probably missed out on all the good stuff like chunks of blue cheese and bacon and stuff.  The thing was very very small and not worth it.  Just a tiny wedge of iceberg with some thousand island on it.  I may try it again but the way it is supposed to be served - with blue cheese and all the good stuffs.  * Rib Eye - very good, very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I would order it again.  The veggies and potatoes that came with were also pretty good but also pretty standard stuff.  I split this with my wife and it was more than enough.  She didn't like it because they split it at the table and not in the kitchen but I don't care.  She also doesn't like the rib eye because it is fatty but I love it and think it is great.  * Mac and Cheese - This was just ok as well.  Not as creamy as I would have liked and they use weird little noodles that I'm not really a fan of.  I would not order this again but it was worth a shot.  The service was very good and my diet cokes came very fast and without asking.  I would return again.   PRO TIP:  Get the local dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) gift certificate !!

My son can't get enough of this place.  Singing, dancing, jumping, climbing; you name it he does it here and loves it.  The place is clean and the staff is great with kids and leading the activities.  We also recently had his 2nd birthday party here.  The party was amazing and all our friends and family had a blast watching the toddlers toddle.  Most importantly, my son had the time of his life.

My wife has been trying to cancel for 2 months.  It is my policy that future charges be cancelled the instant my wife says "cancel".  Them needing signed forms is irrelevant to me.  However, they said they will make an exception and refund the money.  Because of this I too will make an exception and put back some stars.

FIVE STARS for the gorgeous facility.  FIVE STARS for Shawn's spin classes.  ONE STAR for the Early Childhood Center.  After my wife gave up trying to arrange a tour of the place, I gave it a swing because I could not believe a place could be as unaccommodating as she described.  After a few days of trying to set a day and time with April via email, she simply gave up and stopped emailing me back.  My wife had the exact same issue with her.  It turns out that this place really isn't geared towards working parents that can't make it in for a tour during the workweek in the middle of the day.  We were hoping for something early in the day or later in the day because of our work schedules, but it was impossible.  I know the Early Childhood Center is staffed during the times we wanted a tour so I don't see why it was such a huge clusterfuk to come in during those times.  We gave this girl April 2 chances to take about $1,000 per month from us for 4 years but she turned it down.  No wonder the JCC is always asking for donations.  This isn't the first time the administration of the JCC has pissed me off.  It is becoming apparent that younger families without the means to make large donations are not important.  While my wife and I are not yet in a position to make large financial donations, we soon will be and the JCC will never be on our list.

FIVE STARS for the facility.  FIVE STARS for Shawn's spin classes.  ZERO STARS because sometimes they don't open when they say they are going to open leaving a line of cars outside their gates in the wee morning hours wondering if they should go home or continue to wait.  ZERO STARS for trying to cancel a gym membership which I've been trying to do for over 4 months.  July - After several attempts I was able to speak over the phone to Cynthia who apparently is almost never in her office during normal business hours.  I told her I wished to cancel my membership.  She let me know that I needed to give notification 30 days in advance and since it was a few days past the beginning of my billing cycle I would have to pay for next month's dues as well.  I wasn't happy with it, but what could I do?  I agreed and she agreed to cancel my membership.  August - my final (I thought) payment was drafted from my bank account as expected.  September - again I was charged so I called again to "membership services" and spoke to Eric who also is more difficult to get a hold of than the President.  He apologized and said that this time I would have to send him an email stating that I wished to cancel (which I did right after our phone call), but I again would be charged the next month's dues because of their 30-day cancellation notification rule.  October - I was charged again of course.  They have taken me for over $200 at this point (3 months of dues) and I feel more coming.  It isn't really about the money because I hope they are doing something worthwhile with it.  My issue is that they make canceling a membership a complete clusterfuk and constantly piss off members who would otherwise be donors.  Update:  I just spoke with Cynthia in membership services.  Of course she has no record of me calling and trying to cancel and was very unconcerned with the fact that I was charged an extra 3 times because she and Eric can't get their acts together.  However, she assured me that my membership is now cancelled and I won't be charged again.  Yeah lets see about that.  I'll update next month with what happens.

It took Chase less than 30 days to accomplish what US Bank couldn't do in 4 months.  Unlike US Bank, Chase's loan process is efficient and not run by a bunch of idiots.  I started my application online, was contacted promptly, and assigned to a physical branch.  Everybody I had the pleasure of speaking with was very informative, had the answers I needed (or could get them), and kept their promises.  Everybody from their central location (wherever they process the applications) down to the branch were very professional and knew how to take care of business.  I'm glad to be a member of this financial institution and wish other banks I work with would get on the ball.

I agree with most of the other reviews about this place.  The food is ok at best and the service is a complete cluster fuq.  The value of the food is ok because they give you a decent amount for the price.  It is all just a bit dry and bland.  The service is very helpful and apologetic when something goes wrong, but it really doesn't help because everything was slow.  You almost feel bad because they are very nice, but really don't know what is going on.  The absolute best part of going here was that the establishment was an old 5 & Diner that went out of business.  It was a trip seeing all of the 5 & Diner decor but now with Mediterranean music being played in the background and people eating hummus at the milk shake counter.  All-in-all I'm glad I went there to try it out, but probably won't go back.

Sitting at my desk in my office, I could see a steady flow of coworkers returning from their lunch breaks with Fatburger soda cups. This was enough to make me crave a big, fat, juicy, heart clogging, carb-filled burger and fries. So one day I decided to venture out and have my own Fatburger experience.  I selected their King Burger combo meal because I always order more than I should. The meal consisted of a 1/2 pound burger, fries and a drink. I got the burger with all the fixins' and selected the fat fries. The total for the meal was $9.19.  Arriving before the lunch rush, there was almost no line. The order taker was friendly and didn't try to "upsize me" or sell me anything other than what I wanted. I waited a bit longer than I wanted for my meal, but I guess that is because they cook everything when it's ordered. My only complaint is that there were no suitable containers in which to take out ketchup. They had those little paper cup things but there was no top to keep the contents from getting all over my car. There were also none of those ketchup packets to be found so I left their establishment ketcupless.  Back in my office I found that the burger and fries actually look like what is on their menu which is a surprise. The size of the meal was very good and filled me up quite nicely and then some, so I guess the food and drink was a good value for my money. My only issue was the actual taste of the food. I found it very bland and average at best. They either need to better season their meat/bun/something or start using some "secret sauce" to flavor up their burgers. I had the same issue with the fries. Thankfully, I was able to pile on salt and steal some leftover ketcup packets from the community fridge.

My wife and I bought a Groupon for this place good for 12 kettle bell classes.  The facility is clean, new and nice and has a bunch of different cardio/weight stuff for their personal training activities.  There are also showers and a massage room for their in-house masseuse.  It is a pretty solid place if you live in the area and want some personal training.  I can't comment on their personal training ability or prices yet though.  We've only had one class so far but it is pretty hardcore and kicks my ass.  Lynn starts pretty basic (well not basic enough for me because I am slow and uncoordinated), but I work my way through it pretty well.  It is a pretty good workout.  I know this because all my muscles are sore.  She offers classes at convenient times which is good because my wife and I need to do things as early in the morning as possible.  Right now we are doing the class at 5:30am, 3 days per week.  My only suggestion so far is to pick a class that doesn't have that many people in it.  Their kettle bell area can be a bit tight if there are more than 5-6 people.  It would be perfect with like 3 people because the last thing I want to do is knock somebody out with my kettle bell.  Anyway, I will update in a few weeks at the end of my 12 classes.

I totally forgot to update but my kettle bell classes have came and went.  They were pretty hardcore and a great workout.  After the classes ended, my wife and I bought several personal training sessions with Mark/Lynn.  They are a bit pricey but the workouts are pretty solid.  I am unable to workout there anymore but my wife still goes a few times per week and seems to love it.  This is definitely a great place to get your workout on and I just wish I lived closer.  Anyway, I highly recommend Lifestyles.

Jeff (the owner) is fast, friendly, and provides great service.  The best part is that I haven't seen very many of my worst enemies (scorpions) around.  I signed up for the monthly plan which is about $40 per month.  $40 is a small price to pay for not having to scream like a little girl every time I see a bug.

My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.  Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.  While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best "toast" I've ever had.  Anyway, I can't wait to go back!

I was not overly excited to eat here because this is just another chain with 'eh' food.  This was my second trip to this place, but will probably be my last because there are just too many good restaurants in the area to waste time eating at run-of-the-mill places like Elephant Bar.  I agree with most of the other reviews that there really is no common theme for the food.  You would think that it is going to be 'jungle' or 'island' themed, but I was at a loss as to what they were actually going for.  The decor is unique and is jungle themed, but the menu was random.  From potato skins and calamari to ribs and coconut fried shrimp; this was more of a more expensive Applebee's than anything else.  I also agree with most of the other reviews on here about the food.  The portions and prices are almost reasonable, but the quality just isn't there.  I ordered the burger and it was clearly from a package and frozen just a few hours before.  The sweet potato fries were ok at best and really nothing special.  Neither were the calamari, nachos, ribs, or tri-tip I tasted.  I agree that all the food may very well have been from Costco.  I have nothing bad to say about the service.  Our waiters were very friendly, helpful and quick and there were no major issues with our party of 9.

I've been to this location a bajillion times.  The food, service and decor is pretty much like all the other Paradise's in AZ but for some reason I like this location best.  I went there yesterday afternoon for lunch and for some reason they didn't have the bread/sauce sample thing they usually have up front.  WTF?  Anyway, I ordered my salad & sandwich as normal.  The ordering/paying process is a bit of a clusterfuq, but the food is good and the service is fast and friendly.

I had the misfortune of spending way too much money at Nordstrom's today, but I was fortunate enough to have had an excellent sandwich here so it kinda sorta made up for it.  I had the steak and portobello sandwich and it was extremely good.  It was full of sliced steak, mushrooms and cheese.  The bread was a chibatta I think and it went excellent with the sandwich.  It was very very good and I would order it again.  My wife had the Caprice salad and it looked good as well.  The place is nice, clean and the staff is very friendly.  However, the place is a gigantic ripoff but it is what you'd expect from a cafe in Nordstrom's.  It was almost $30 for a sandwich, salad and a soda.  I would go back though because the sandwich was that good.  Their other stuff looks good as well.

The sushi is good but the place itself is gross.  Like sticky gross.  Like "I can't believe I ate raw fish here" gross.  Also they ran out of iced tea and half the wine that was listed on their crumpled up, gross, sticky menu.  I know.... who orders wine at a sushi place?  I don't know but for some reason my wife and my friend's wife wanted some, ok?

This place is the ultimate Tempe dive bar.  In my opinion this place is in one of the sketchiest strip malls in Tempe.  I could write a review on the parking lot alone, but that is for another day.  Anyway, enter the Yucca Tap and go to the right and you will see a depressing, dimly-lit bar.  To the left is a well-lit whiskey/beer bar.  My wife and I visited the Yucca on a random Saturday night at about 8:30ish.  The place wasn't too busy...yet.  We first went to the right.  We each got a beer and had a seat in one of their many booths.  There was a small band on stage.  There were only a handful of people there and most looked like they had been there all day drinking away their sorrows and/or hiding from the law.  The place was pretty depressing.  However, I like cheap drinks, friendly bar tenders and dive bars so I was ok with it.  Not exactly a place to bring your wife though.  Anyway, the other half of the bar (to the left when you enter) is a totally different story.  They have a great selection of beers and sort of reminds me of an older, grittier Taste of Tops.  We sat there for about an hour, sampled some more of their beers then took off.  I will definitely return when I feel the urge for some local dive bar action.  The entire place isn't as bad as it looks, has cheap drinks and everyone seemed pretty friendly.

This is a great place for a sandwich.  They have plenty of quality sandwiches and unique combinations to choose from at reasonable prices.  It was difficult to decide and I was a bit flustered because they have so many choices, but I settled on the Encore.  Because my wife wasn't with me, I chose the biggest and most unhealthy one on the menu.  It was excellent!  It was of a decent size and had plenty of quality ingredients inside.  I was also surprised that it was made so fast considering it was the lunch rush.  I can't wait to come back and try each one of their other sandwiches.  It is a complete bummer that this places isn't open on the weekends which seems to be the only time I am in the area around lunch time.  The only other bummer was that at lunch time during the week the parking lot is a complete clusterfuq and difficult to find a space.  Normally I would just screw it and go somewhere else but I'm glad I stuck it out.

This place offers so much yet I have experienced so little.  I've lived down the street ever since it was built but have only made the 10 minute (walking) trek twice.  The first time was to see the Chuck Jones exhibit which was very cool and very interesting.  The second time was last night for their open mic night (http://www.tempe.gov/TCA/wiw.htm).  The inside and outside of the TCA is actually pretty cool.  I've never seen the inside the concert area, but inside the surrounding area is pretty neat.  I can't really explain it but it has a good vibe.  My wife and I have been wanting to try their lounge/cafe/bar thing ever since it opened.  We heard that it was a nice place to sit and enjoy the TCA and the surrounding sights.  So, when we heard about the live music in the lounge we finally decided to give the place a try.  However, upon arriving, we found that the open mic thing had grown to popular so it was moved into a much larger and less intimate area of the TCA.  The room was nice but reminded me of a room in a conference center, but it did have a very good view of their negative edge pool/fountain thing overlooking the lake.  There was small bar setup where you could purchase wine/beer/cocktails and snacks.  Nothing to elaborate, fancy or expensive.  Anyway, my wife and I sat for about an hour and listened to some up-and-coming musicians.  I really wasn't a fan of them, but I give them mad props for getting up there and doing their thing.  However, it was a relatively good time and I could probably sit there all night and listen to random and diverse music.  You can check it out every Wednesday from 6:30 till 11:30 I think.  The bar shuts down at 9ish though.  After we left the the open mic area we visited the main bar/lounge thing.  It had a very nice ambiance and was pretty dead which was nice.  You can sit, watch tv or enjoy the view of the lake.  The beer/wine/cocktail selection is pretty standard for a small bar.  Anyway, it was a neat experience and nice to have a place like TCA less than a mile from my house.  I'm not sure I would rush back to the open mic thing, but if I'm ever board on a Wednesday night, I know where to walk.  However, I can't wait to see a concert/show in the main concert hall to see what that's all about.

I love this place.  Casual, relatively inexpensive and consistently good food.  I've pretty much been to all their locations and this one is no different.  Solid food and solid service.  It has been a while since I've been to a Sauce so I did notice the addition of 2 bruschettas to the menu.  We had to try it so we ordered the portebella and artichoke one.  I know it isn't the best most fancy brushetta, but I really did love it.  The bread was crispy and fluffy yet not so hard; just the way I like it.  I also like it that they don't bombard you with 27 different options for bruschetta.  There are only 2 to choose from so that was nice.  For my main meal I had 1/2 of a turkey pannini and a small Caesar salad - one of their "mix-it" meals.  Both were excellent and I would order them again.  Anyway, I can't wait to go back for any of their soups/salads/paninis/pizzas as they are all excellent.

Went here for lunch this weekend and had the "mix it" thing with 1/2 salad and 1/2 panini.  I had the house salad with the Gorgonzola vinaigrette and the roast beef panini.  The panini was excellent but the salad was not.  The dressing lacked flavor.  I'm going to stick to the Caesar.

I went here for lunch today.  The place looks just like you would expect and was packed.  I was in a hurry so I ordered my torta to go.  It was like $10 for the torta and a can of soda and it was ready in about 5 minutes.  I have eaten a lot of very random and very no-so-good-for-you food in my day but this torta may take the lead.  As I started to chow down on my  Torta Del Rey 3 things went through my mind:  #1 - wtf am I eating #2 - my wife is going to kill me for setting my diet back 2 years and clogging my arteries even more #3 - how the fu*k am I supposed to eat this thing without getting it all over my shirt and pants.  I am a torta virgin and I think this might have been my first legit torta experience.  I have never in all my life seen a sandwich with so much sh*t piled on.  I took one bite like a normal sandwich then I gave up for fear of making a complete mess of myself.  I stuck to the fork and knife method which worked much better.  Anyway, the taste of the torta is just ok because there really isn't much flavor going on.  To be honest I was expecting an explosion of flavors from all the stuff on the torta but it was just eh.  The hot sauces (both red and green) were great and added to the flavor.    I would go back but would probably not have the torta.  The rest of their menu looks pretty good and authentic but after tasting their flagship cuisine; I'm not expecting greatness.  I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the uniqueness (at least to me) and authenticity of the food.

I have been here 2 or 3 times since the place opened.  I love good BBQ, but this place really doesn't do it for me.  To start they give you biscuits with a side of maple (I think) butter which is really very good.  Their ribs are ok and so is their chicken, but I think their brisket is no good at all.  I really really like their grits (probably because I've never really eaten them before).  I would much rather go to Famous Daves or Bobby Q's.  Lucille's portions are larger than the other places but so are the prices.  The service is always very friendly at Lucielle's but also very slow even when they are not too busy.

My wife and I have been going to the Gordon Biersch on Mill for years and this was our first visit to this location.  The Mill location is a lot larger and a lot less crowded.  I think the ambiance and view of the Mill location is a bit better to my eye than this location.  Anyway, the service, food and beer is pretty much the same at both locations.  My wife is a member of their Stein Club thing and so we get invited to several events per year where we get some free food and beer.  After the event we normally stay for a bite to eat.  I'm really not a fan of their food but stay partly because I feel bad for drinking the free beer and partly because I am too lazy to get dinner somewhere else.  Last night there was an event featuring their Maibach beer.  I had a few of those and sampled some of their orange chicken and garlic edamame.  The Maibach was excellent but the food was just eh.  The orange chicken was slightly better quality than Panda Express and really not very good and very odd for a German beer place.  Actually, most of their menu is odd for a German beer place.  The garlic sauce stuff that they put on their garlic fries was the same thing they used for the edamame.  It was unique but really not very good.  I mean it is a slightly healthier option than the fries but is really just too oily/buttery to put over edamame.

This is by far my grocery store of choice.  For things like laundry detergent and toothpaste I go elsewhere, but for produce, meat and other food stuffs, this is my go-to place.  Everything seems to be fresh and of good quality.  Their selection is good, prices ok, and their workers are very friendly.  Oh and lets not forget their samples because most of the time they are plentiful and awesome.  I love their different food stations that cover just about everything under the sun.  My wife and I love to stop at their sushi and/or sandwich station to eat before we finish our shopping.  The food is pretty reasonably priced as well.  I love the sandwiches - even the all veggie one (who knew!?!?)  Oh...and their beer/wine bar thing is pretty awesome as they always have interesting things on tap.  I do however have 2 main gripes about this place though.  #1, they rarely have garbage cans near their sample stations.  What if you have to throw away a toothpick or napkin that comes with the sample?  Or, what if you don't like the sample altogether?  #2, it seems like their beer/wine bar thing isn't staffed most of the time so it can be a bit difficult to get a drink.

I had a Boston Cream cupcake at an event tonight.  WOW! One of the best cupcakes I've ever eaten.  I do enjoy Cupcakes and Sprinkles from time to time, but these were on another level.  I'm not even sure you can call them cupcakes because they were definitely not your typical cupcake.  They are larger than normal cupcakes and you pretty much have to use a fork to eat them right out of the wrapper thing.  The best part is that they have stuff in the middle, Bavarian creme in this case.  Anyway, I will try more of their cupcakes and hopefully soon.  Sure I'll have to put a few more miles on the ole' treadmill but it is worth it!

My group stumbled in here a bit after 10pm last Saturday night during a light rail pub crawl.  We forgot to stop somewhere for dinner and we were starving.  After searching the streets of downtown Phoenix for a suitable place, we found ourselves by the still-crowded Pizzeria Bianco.  I knew it was a few minutes after 10pm and the place was "closed" but I pleaded with the hostess to let us in for a quick pizza to no avail.  So, after walking a few steps, we found ourselves at The Rose and Crown which to our surprise was still serving food.  As an added bonus it was some sort of 80's night and everyone but us was dressed in 80's gear.  We all just popped our collars and tried to fit in.  It was a real random mix of people there but they were all friendly.  Anyway, we ordered up a few pints and a bunch of artery clogging bar food.  We were also lucky enough to score a nice table in one of the rooms.  And in regard to one of the Yelp posts on here, no, they still have not found the remote to the giant fan in that room.  It was so friggin hot and that fan would have been amazing.  We ordered some fries, chicken wings, and potato skins and everything was 'eh.  I didn't think it was very good bar food.  Pretty bland.  HOWEVER, it did come very quick somehow.  I also remember that the jalapenos they put on some of the stuff were hot as heck so watch out.  Anyway, it was quick and hit the spot so we were happy.  The place itself is pretty neat.  It is just an old house with a bar in the middle.  There is seating inside and out.  The place is pretty chill but nothing too spectacular.  I'm not sure I'll rush back but it is definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.

I went here for dinner on a Thursday night.  The place was mostly dead which I liked.  The service was very fast and friendly which was also very good.  The menu is pretty typical for a Chinese type restaurant in Phoenix and so are the prices.  The food was very good especially the hot & sour soup, the sa cha beef, and the fried rice.  We ordered soup, 3 entrees, 1 fried rice, and 1 lo mein and the bill was very reasonable for all that food at only about $60.  If I am ever in the area again and have a hankering for some Chinese food, then I would not hesitate to return.

4 stars for the food and prices.  All of their food looks good and some stuff is pretty unique.  I had their homemade corned beef hash with some eggs and rye toast that never came.  My wife had the Pollo Loco omelet which was good as well.  Good stuff and reasonable prices.  However, if you enjoy the following, Over Easy is probably the place for you.  * a crappy parking situation * a 20 minute wait (which isn't that bad if the place is worth it) * being so crammed in that you are basically sitting on top of the people next to you * being ridiculously hot because they couldn't spring for more/better fans or an outdoor A/C thing (my fault for going in September but tons of people were standing in line to be crammed and hot so I thought I could stick it out) * bad service (god forbid they ask you if everything is ok, if you need anything else, or want a refill on anything but water)  Oh and if my server is reading this, I am still waiting on my toast you said, "would be right out".

I still have no idea how I've lived within walking distance of this place for years and never heard about it.  This place is in a very odd location and is pretty hidden if you aren't staring at it or happen to be walking past as was the case with the wife and I.  I haven't been in tons of coffee houses in my day, but this one is probably the coolest one I've seen yet.  The place is very laid back and pretty unique.  There is a giant coffee roaster thing towards the back which looks like an antique (I think) that they still use to roast all their coffees.  I would venture a guess and say there aren't many places around that use such a machine so that is neat.  Actually I am really not that into the coffee scene so I really have no idea.  I just know that the place is pretty cool.  Could use more big comfy couches though.  I ordered an iced sugar free vanilla late and it was excellent.  The quality of their coffee really shows as it is strong and flavorful but not too overpowering.  My wife had a standard coffee with one of their super special limited-quantity roasts.  She loved it because she is a coffee snob but I thought it was just ok.  We also picked up a bag of their coffee to take home and it smells delicious and I can't wait to brew it.  Anyway, this is a great little independent coffee shop with excellent service and a very relaxed atmosphere.  Tempe is lucky to have it and all coffee snobs out there should definitely give it a shot.

I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.  I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.  The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.  Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.  The Food:  * Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever. * Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to. * Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good * Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles. * Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh. * Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.  All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.

I wasn't expecting anything great from this place.  Just another pizza place in a strip mall blah blah blah.  However, I was pleasantly proven wrong and this place puts out a very respectable pizza.  I went here with a party of 4 a few days ago.  It was a weeknight at about 7:30 and the place was pretty crowded but we were seated promptly.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  She also brought me a carafe of ice tea so she wouldn't have to keep running back to refill me.  I know it is stupid but it is the little details that matter to me.  Anyway, about the food:  * Caesar and Greek Salads = The full is enough to share with 2-3 people but the bread bowl they serve it in is a bit of a waste if you ask me because I try not to fill up on bread before my pizza.  Anyway, the salads were pretty good.  * Grandma's and Little Nicky Pizza = EXCELLENT!! We all shared 1 large that was half Grandma's and half Little Nicky.  It was more than enough for 4 people.  The crust was awesome as it should be given this place's name.  Not too hard, not too soft, not floppy, not too chewy, etc. etc.  The Little Nicky was phenomenal and I am definitely getting that next time along with some other ones I want to try.  I just hope they will let me split a pizza among 3-4 different kinds.  I also want to try that "thong" pizza.  Pro Tips:  * Get the Local Dines 50% off gift cert ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Works like a champ and well worth it!  * Don't get the gelato.  I tried it and I think it was old and freezer burned.  The flavors aren't even that good.  They got me with the small cone for $1, but it wasn't even worth it.

This place is truly a one-stop-shop for all things related to pets.  I've been taking my dog (Charlie) here for over 6 years.  They probably offer more services than these, but these are what I've experienced so far:  * Veterinary Services = Up until recently I didn't have a regular doctor so I just saw whoever was available because my dog just needed a checkup and/or shots.  All the doctors on staff there are very nice and very helpful and seem to really care about your pet.  Now that my dog has some health problems I try to see the same doctor.  I highly recommend doctor Bjornebo.    * Grooming = Once every 3 or 4 months when I go out of town and leave my dog there in their kennel, I ask that he be groomed.  When I pick him up he is clean, smells nice and has a nice haircut.  I honestly have no idea who the groomer is but he/she does a very good job.  I like it that I just tell the receptionist that I want my dog groomed and they take care of it all before I pick him up.  *  Boarding = Every couple of months I leave my dog here when I go out of town for a few days.  I have no idea if he likes it or not but I don't get any complaints from him.  All the boarding care taker people seem to know my dog because he has become a regular and they all seem very nice.  Who knows what goes on when I am not there, but my dog always gets returned in once piece so I can't complain.  When you pick your dog up they give you a cute little "report card" letting you know about your dog's stay.  They always write that my dog is a little cutie and a pleasure but I think they say that about all the dogs because mine can be a bit of an a-hole sometimes.  I always get an inside cage because they throw in an extra walk which my dog loves.  I also splurge and buy a "TLC Time" which is extra play time for an extra charge.  I'm a sucker..I know.  * Doctor Supervised Boarding = This is like a hospital for your pet if they have semi-serious health issues and you are unable to properly care for them at your home.  I had no idea this existed until recently when my dog came down with vestibular disease brought on by valley fever.  Basically he was extremely disoriented and couldn't walk or move very much at all.  There was no way I could care for him at home so I brought him there for a few days and he was babied by a bunch of doctors and nurses.  I was provided with regular status updates and was able to visit whenever I wanted.  I was also surprised that it wasn't that much more expensive than regular boarding (under $10/day more I think).    A lot of reviews on here talk about how this place is too expensive.  Their services aren't cheap but I can't comment on how much more they are than at other places because I haven't comparison shopped.  The prices aren't outrageous (I think) and I like the service my dog and I get so I can't complain.  Plus their hours are awesome so that is a plus.  I just wish they had some kind of frequent shopper program for boarding, grooming and/or other stuff because I spend so much money there.....

This place looks like a typical American franchise and I was not expecting the food and service to be very good.  However, what I found was the exact opposite.  I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was mostly dead with only 3 or 4 other diners.  We were met at the counter by a very friendly hostess/cashier/server.  She gave us a rundown of the menu and a few specials they were offering.  We ordered the red pepper hummus, a Gyro salad, a spicy grilled chicken with fire feta salad, and a piece of baklava.  The prices were reasonable at everything cost about $20.  You can't beat their $1 specials which cover their soups, hummus and baklava selections.  We sat down and our hummus arrived almost immediately.  It was excellent.  Especially the pitas which were fluffy, hot and fresh.  Five minutes later our salads arrived and they were equally good.  The spicy chicken salad with fire feta was a bit weird (which is why I ordered it) but in a good way.  It was a very decent size and all the ingredients seemed to be fresh.  The salad had a kick to it so they weren't lying about the "spicy" or "fire" part.  The gyro salad was excellent.  I wish I had ordered that but wanted to try something different from my dining partner.  Next time I will definitely order it.  Anyway, the gyro was very fresh and had been cut just seconds before serving.  The salad was a decent size and very tasty.  For desert we shared a piece of baklava.  It was delicious and just a few bites cured my sweet tooth.

I went here with a group of about 8 people for a friends birthday.  My wife and I arrived early to check out the upstairs lounge.  It was about 7:30 on a Tuesday night and it was DEAD.  We were the only people upstairs except for the 3 or 4 bartenders/waitresses.  The inside and the outside patio are both very nice.  The drinks were standard and the prices were just what you'd think they would be.  Anyway, we each ordered a cocktail as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  Our waitress was very fast and friendly....probably because we were the only ones there.  Downstairs was just as dead.  There were probably 5 other patrons in the entire place.  I have zero idea how this place stays in business.  I guess it was just a slow night but it worked to our advantage because we had an excellent gang of waiters and bussers who provided top notch service.  I think we only had one main waiter, but he was excellent.  Excellent food descriptions, excellent recommendations, very prompt with requests, etc.  I normally don't review the bread places give you to start but OMG it was amazing.  I'm trying to limit my carb intake but I just couldn't resist the bread.  To start I shared the Estate House Salad with my wife.  It was good and I would order it again.  It probably isn't enough to split though.  For my entree I had the pepper crusted steak.  It was excellent and a large portion.  Though some people at my table thought the blue cheese and/or pepper were overpowering; I thought it was excellent and complimented the steak just enough.  It was very flavorful and I would definitely order it again.  I had known about the Estate House for a while but never seriously thought to check it out and probably wouldn't have ever went if it wasn't requested by the birthday girl.  The menu is pricey and didn't seem like anything special or unique.  However, I'm glad I went but probably won't be back until I try a ton of other places first.  The Estate house provides quality food as well as outstanding service, but you definitely pay for it.

Great selection, prices and service.  I go here every once in a while when I need some alcohol but this review is more about a lesser known service that Bevmo provides.  Every couple of weeks they have one of their wine distributors come in to do a "class".  Well I guess it is more of an information session than a formal class.  Anyway, a guy brings in about 5 or 6 wines and provides information about where they come from and other misc. info.  The guy has lots of great stories and provides some interesting details about the wines.  Each session is about a different wine region and/or type of wine and is about an hour.  It costs just a few bucks and you get 5-6 good size pours along with some cheese and prosciutto.  It really is a great value and a pretty good time.  Not many people show up so its not that bad when I ask stupid questions.  Last night was the 3rd class I've been to so far and as always it was a good time and very informative.  Talk to Jim, Bevmo's manager if you are interested in signing up for the next class.  He will add you to their list and shoot you an email with details when the next class is coming up.

This is one of my favorite chain fast food places.  Everything seems pretty fresh and can be a bit more healthy than your typical fast food fare.  This location is just like all the rest.  It is clean, the staff is friendly, and the prices all seem to be reasonable (though I think a bit higher than they should be for what you get).  The line can get pretty long during peak times, but it seems to move pretty fast.  I always get the same thing:  a bowl or salad with chicken although I don't know how a bowl and a salad are different.  Anyway, I get lettuce, chicken, corn salsa stuff, hot salsa and shredded cheese.  LOVE it!  Light on the carbs but probably high in calories...oh well...I try.  Pro Tip:  If you want cheese, sour cream and/or guacamole, order it on the side.  Even if you say you want a little bit, they will put heaps on your bowl/salad.

Decent BBQ at a decent price with decent portion sizes.  Probably some of the best in the immediate area.  I went here Friday night with a party of 6.  The place wasn't too crowded and we were seated right away.  We got there at about 8:30ish but didn't get our food until almost 9:30.  I have no idea why they were so slow.  Anyway, I love their sauces.  I also like that they put all 6 or so of them on every table.  I don't like having to ask for more or having to get up to get some like at some other places.

I ordered lunch from here for my wife and I a few days ago.  The service was excellent even though I didn't actually sit and eat.  I just ordered, waited for the food then left.  The place is very nice and you can tell that it was recently remodeled.  They did an excellent job at it.  I think this was actually my first Vietnamese food experience so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  First, my wife and I split the Pho which is some sort of soup.  It was unique and excellent.  Full of flavor and spice.  I would definitely order it again.  Then I had the short ribs as my entree.  They were excellent and full of flavor as well.  Next time I'm going to be more adventurous and order something that I don't know how to pronounce.  Everything on the menu looks very good and now that I know that this place serves up some quality foreign cuisine, I will definitely be back.

I really don't expect much from strip-mall sushi places in the east valley.  They are basically a dime-a-dozen and are generally just blah.  However, this place is the exception.  The first thing I noticed is that the inside is huge for a sushi place.  It is very nice and very well kept.  It doesn't look sticky and gross like some other places.  The entire staff is very friendly however our waitress disappeared 1/2 way through our meal which made getting my diet coke refills difficult.  They should really hire some more waitresses because the place gets pretty busy and with only 1 or 2 waitresses working the floor, they tend to get overworked.  Our party of 4 ordered a ton of sushi and I was amazed how fast it was put together.  I only saw 2-3 sushi chefs and the place was busy so they must be pretty awesome.  They have a great selection of sushi and everything we ordered looked to be very fresh and was delicious.  While we didn't order the always-popular all-you-can-eat sushi special; I do want to try it when I'm feeling gluttonous.  Their all-you-can-eat sushi menu seems pretty robust and has probably 30 different rolls on it.  I mean for $20 you really can't go wrong especially with the quality sushi this place seems to deliver.  I hope to return soon.

For some reason I wasn't expecting this place to be any good.  It is almost trendy to not like this place.  I guess it is an easy target for people around here because it is a chain, an entertainer's name is attached to it, and prices are more than Applebees.  I however, can think for myself and keep an open mind.  I knew going in that this was going to be typical "Mexican" food joint like Garcias or whatever you people consider to be good Mexican food.  The food is obviously Mexican inspired and their special twist is added to each dish.  Again, if you want "Mexican" food, go somewhere else to get your chimichanga.  Anyway, I went there last night with a party of 6 at around 7ish.  The place was probably 1/2 full and we were seated promptly.  The decor is unique for the area and quite a nice change.  It was almost like you aren't in Tempe Marketplace.  There was also live music that surprisingly wasn't too loud so we could all converse without straining to hear or be heard.  To start you get chips and salsas.  The chips were fresh and pretty good.  The salsas were also very good and 2 of them had a nice kick to them.  We also ordered the guacamole.  It was eh and lacked pizazz.  It was just basically mushed up avocado and nothing more.  Well nothing more I could taste really.  For my meal I ordered the steak fajitas and they were excellent.  Tender strips of steak, sauteed peppers/onions and full of juicy goodness.  The bacon they add, which sounds gross, was actually a solid addition.  I would definitely order the dish again.  I agree that the prices are too steep.  Everything should be about $5 less.  However, most of their menu looks excellent and I would like to come back to try more stuff.  The service was excellent up until the end where he royally messed up our checks and quickly brushed us off to his manager because he couldn't be bothered to deal with it.  I had a $40 cert from Local Dines (http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ) that I got for $20.  It came in handy and is the best deal around.  The only crappy part is that places sometimes act like they have never seen a gift certificate before and it turns into a clusterfuq.

I went here for lunch today with some coworkers.  It was about noonish and the lunch rush we beginning but I have to admit the line moved fairly quickly.  I ordered the ruben and it arrived in well under 10 minutes as did the rest of my partys' orders.  I'm giving this place 4 stars as a solid lunch spot, but saying they are a "deli" is kind of pushing it a bit.  They do have some deliesq food, but I just can't call it a deli.  I mean they have wraps, fru fru salads, pictures of Europe on the walls, a salad bar, etc.  For 10 bucks I got a pretty decent sized sandwich, chips, drink and some ice cream so I can't really complain.  The ruben though was just ok by my standards and the other sandwiches looked just ok as well.  The bread was ok, the helping of meat was ok, the sauerkraut was ok.  Everything was ok.  I just compare everything to Chompies which is the closest you can get out here to a real deli and by far my favorite deli sandwich place around.

I just started "running" about a year ago.  When I say "running" that means I'm working my way up to a 5k from being a fat ass.  Anyway, after a few months of running in old shoes my wife talked me into going here and getting "real" running shoes and not just whatever sneakers were on sale at the mall.  I was afraid I would be talked into a $200 pair by some salesperson who would make me think they would enable me to run for forever without getting tired.  However, this was not the case at all.  Our guy there, Brandon, analyzed my running on their treadmill thing and recommended some very reasonable kicks.  They were like $50 or something.  They lasted for like a year and I just went back to see Brandon last weekend to get something new.  Again he recommended a very good pair that I love so far.  They were pretty inexpensive as well.   Right when you walk in the door you will probably be greeted by an overly friendly associate like the moment you step out of your car at a car dealership.  He/she will then try to answer your questions or give you to an employee that works in the particular department of the gear you are looking to purchase.  However, if you are just browsing somebody will probably come up to you every 2 minutes to ask if you need any assistance.  Anyway, aside from that, it is a pretty good shopping experience.  It also looks like they have some pretty sweet deals and sales if you are part of their "club".  A member of my family is so I use his discount which is usually pretty substantial so if you are a mildly serious runner then I would spring the few bucks to become a member.  Their selection of running stuffs seems to be pretty large and comprehensive.  I can't think of anything else I would ever need to run.  Looks like there is some pretty advanced stuff there but I doubt I'll ever get to the point of actually needing it.  I plan to return every few months for a new pair and whatever other gear I think I need to run like the wind.

I went here for Mother's Day brunch and it was excellent.  This place definitely does not serve up your typical breakfast/lunch fare.  Everything is pretty unique and delicious.  The crowd is always great as is the general vibe of the place especially the patio area when the weather is nice.  Coming from Tempe I just love the DC Ranch area especially Market Street.  Anyway, about the food:  * Egg with salmon hash - I think this was special for Mother's Day.  It sounded weird and I don't know why I ordered it, but I was glad I did.  It was like corned beef hash except with fresh salmon instead of corned beef and little real potatoes instead of the tiny potato things in normal hash.  It was excellent.    * Red Velvet Pancakes - HOLY SH*T!  Best-Pancakes-EVER!  Enough said.  * Sweet Potato Chips - Some of the best I've ever had.  * Low Fat Banana Bread  - Pretty good, but low fat?  Yeah right.   The service was pretty good but was a bit slow at times.  Probably because it was so busy due to the holiday.  They also aren't very happy with custom orders so just stick to what is on the menu.

I went here last night with a party of 6 and I can't believe I've never Yelped this place before.  I've been here several times over the years and pretty much everything to be said has been said on other's Yelp reviews, but here is my overview:  1 - all the food is great, portions good and priced decently 2 - make a reservation - the place gets busy 3 - the place is loud as heck.  I feel like I'm 80 just saying it, but the acoustics of the place are horrible and you have to yell to others in your party during prime time when the place is busy 4 - food comes out fast but I have no idea why you have to wait 10 minutes for another beer or diet coke  Last night I had the short rib over creamy polenta and it was amazingly awesome.

Went here with a party of 3 last night (Tuesday) at about 7pm.  The place was mostly empty with just a few diners eating.  The decor is modern, neat and clean if that makes sense to anybody.  It wasn't over the top and you probably couldn't tell this was an Indian food place by looking at the decor at all.  I am beginning to like Indian cuisine and its good that there is a place like Bombay Spice that makes it healthier.  This is good because I had no idea that "regular" Indian food was unhealthy.  Oops.  I've been meaning to try this place for a while and by chance I found it on Local Dines so I snatched up a $40 cert for $20 ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Definitely a solid find for a solid place and worth it because their food isn't very expensive to begin with.  Anyway, the service was excellent and the food came out quickly.  Here is what I sampled:  * Caesar Salad - this was weird and I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't get it again.  It was just Romain lettuce  tossed with some weird Caesar-like dressing.  Our waitress said it was a weird salad but I wanted it anyway.  * Sauce Sampler w/ naan bread - this was just ok.  It was worth it though to try their sauces.  Nothing to special about it.  * Lentil Soup - I didn't like this.  It was really thick and weird.  * Tikka Skewers - Peppers, onions and chicken stir fried.  This was pretty good.  * Beef Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, Spinach and Tofu, and Chicken Keema - all of this was very good.  I got 2 of the above and sampled the rest off of the other plates of my party.  My only real issue is that the food lacked a certain kick or pizazzz.  I guess that's what all the unhealthy stuff that other places use adds to the dish.  I don't know....it just wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  I would order the stuff again though.  Perhaps next time I will kick it up a noch with some of that stuff on the table that looks like cinnamon but later learned it was some hot spice stuff.  I will be back soon to try more of their stuff!

Good service but the food is just eh.  The golf course view from the restaurant and the Westin in general are beautiful, but this place is just blah.  From the menu and prices you'd think that the ambiance would be nice and food would be phenomenal resort fare, but this place misses the mark entirely.  What you get is a stark atmosphere that has very little to do with the supposed theme of the place and food that just isn't that good.  I'm normally a ribeye fan, but after one look at this place and knowing that this definitely isn't a steak house, I decided to get something that I didn't think they could screw up; a $21 burger.  You would think that, because of the location of this place and the prices, that they could master making the best burger and fries possible.  Wrong.  Instead, what you get is Applebee's.  Well, at Applebee's they might cook it properly so that is probably a bad comparison.  I guess what it comes down to is that the Westin really doesn't expect the people to come back.  They have a steady flow of suckers on expense accounts that might not know there are top-notch restaurants less than a quarter mile away.  However, I am a local that lives a mile away that now knows better.  From now on I plan to stick to cocktails at the hotel's main bar overlooking the golf course.

My wife and I went here for lunch a few days ago.  I tried to be super smart and healthy and ordered the Chipotle Ranch salad, but it was probably more of a calorie bomb than the tacos.  Anyway, it was pretty tasty and of a decent size.  I'm not sure I like a mound of guacamole and full size tortilla chips (not strips) in my salad, but it was good nonetheless.  I would like to return to try their tacos.  Their chips were good and fresh but their 4 or so salsas were just ok.  None really stood out to me in terms of flavor or heat.  The only thing that really stood out about this place was the service.  The staff here really went out of their way to be super nice and friendly which is rare for a fast food type place.

This is my new go-to place when I want some quality ice cream, sorbet or yogurt.  They say it is all made in small batches using fresh local ingredients.  I had a small Almond Buttercrunch ice cream which was terrific and really hit the spot.  I could really tell that they used only the best and freshest ingredients because the taste was much better than Baskin Robins or Cold Stone ice cream.  My fiance got a small fruit flavored yogurt or sorbet (I forget which) and it was amazing.  It was light and tasty and you could definitely tell that it was made with fresh fruit.  The place wasn't too busy and the workers (I think they were the owners) were very friendly and helpful.  At about $3 for a very small cup it is pretty pricey, but no doubt worth it.  I will hopefully be back soon to sample some of their other flavors.  My only regrets are that I didn't sample more of the 'exotic' flavors and that I didn't use one of their ice cream sticks made from birch wood to eat my ice cream.   It makes me happy that there are still entrepreneurs out there that are willing to make a superior product with superior ingredients all the while being environmentally responsible.

I really dislike getting my car washed.  I just cannot stand all the sales bullsh*t.  Sometimes I just want a basic car wash and that is it.  No wax, no fragrance, no oil change, no windshield chip sealant, etc., etc., etc.   Yet every car wash place keeps pressing the upsale crap and tries to give you "the deal of the day".  Well I guess it is a business and they have to do what they have to do.  Anyway, this place is no different and have come to expect the sales pitches.  I've been here about 6 times since it opened and they have always done an excellent job washing my car.  The price is reasonable but yes, it is a ripoff just like all the other places.  This past weekend I got the interior of my car detailed and they did a great job.  No, I didn't get 'sold' the detail as I was planning to have it done for a while.  I definitely plan to return in the future.

For a place that has been there for over 20 years, I'm surprised that more people haven't heard of this place.  I know there has been many different owners as Charlie G. mentioned in his review, but that is no excuse for more Yelpers not knowing about this place.  NY's Best Italian Bistro is in a random location in the Scottsdale Air Park right by the runway.  We sat inside because it was freezing out, but had it been warmer it would have been nice to watch the planes landing/taking off while eating our meals.  My party of 4 went last night (Monday) at about 7pm and the place was not crowded at all.  The place is very cozy with about 2 dozen tables and a small bar area.  I was told that the place gets pretty busy around lunch time and on weekends.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a host/our waiter/the place's owner.  He is the nicest guy ever and I could have listened to him talk about his food all day long.  He is a heavyset Italian fellow who talks with a strong NY/Italian accent.  You can tell he loves his restaurant and his food with a passion.  We asked him several questions about his establishment and his food and he provided friendly and detailed answers.  Their menu is not has huge as some of the other Italian places around, but still contains the typical fare.  I hate it when there are millions of choices because it makes it difficult to choose.  The bread our table was given was superb.  It was fresh, hot and fluffy.  I'm not sure what kind it was but I think it was some type of foccacia bread.  It came with a bowl of olive oil with some spices/other stuff which was an excellent combination.  * I was really looking forward to the Caesar salad with their homemade dressing but right when I was about to order it our waiter said, "Wait, our chef messed up and made an extra Mediterranean salad.  I'll give that to your table on the house."  I couldn't argue with that so I'll get the Caesar next time.  Anyway, the Mediterranean salad was excellent and full of good stuff.  It is enough for 4 people to share.  * Next we got a small 10 inch Margarita pizza to share.  It was excellent.  You could tell that the mozzarella was fresh and the sauce homemade.  It is more than enough for a few people to share for an appetizer.  * Chicken Parm - WOW!  A huge piece of breaded chicken topped with homemade sauce and more of that great mozzarella.  It was soooo good!  Just about all the meals come with a side of pasta and I like it that you can choose whole wheat pasta.  Thats what I got and it was ok.  I probably could have done without it though.  For dessert I insisted we at least try something so I ordered their homemade cannoli.  It wasn't excellent but was pretty good.  I like that it wasn't humongous though.  Next time I'm going to try their homemade tiramisu.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their excellent food.  I want to try everything, but I may try a healthier option and get meatballs or meat bolognese over veggies.  I cleared it with the owner and he assured me they would make just about any of their meals any way that you want.

I returned here a few evenings ago with a party of 6.  The service and food was excellent as always.  I had the eggplant parm which was great and so was the Caesar salad.  We also ordered a large margarita pizza.  I didn't really like it that much because there wasn't enough cheese but I was told that is how it should be.  The crust however was phenomenal.  It was kinda on the thicker side, a bit crispy and a bit chewey.  It kinda sorta had the flavor and texture of a croissant.  I didn't confirm it, but it didn't matter because it was excellent.

I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.  The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.  The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well.   The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.

I have been to this location for lunch about 6 times so far.  I love the salads and LOVE the cookies.  Their sandwiches on the other hand can use some work.  Paradise Bakeries around the valley have had the same sandwiches for forever.  They NEED some new stuff.  The prices are reasonable for the size of the meal you get and the service is always pretty good.  My only issue is with the giant g-d damn clusterfuk that ensues when the place is busy.  The whole process of ordering your meal and paying for it can be a bit confusing and a hassle.  I can't really describe it but if you've ever been there then you know what I mean.  Anyway, I am a fan of Paradise and will continue to go even though it can be a pain.

I went here yesterday for lunch during the lunch rush.  If my wife wasn't with me I would have left because the line was too long for me and I hate waiting.  Anyway, she wanted to eat here so I had to suck it up.  To my eye this place is a combination of Sauce and Paradise Cafe.  It is not a bad thing because they definitely put their own spin on things.  The menu is simple and doesn't overwhelm you with options.  The prices are a bit high but you do get some quality stuff so I guess it is ok.  Aside from the line and the clusterfuq of an ordering/pickup process, this place is actually pretty solid.  The salads and sandwiches are fresh, unique, customizable, tasty and awesome.  I had a small Caesar and 1/2 of an AZ tri-tip sandwich.  The Caesar was just ok but my sandwich was great.  I love how they grill the meat right there in front of you.  My wife got some fru fru salad which she loved.  I just moved into the area so I can't wait to return to try more of their soups/salads/sandwiches and pizzas.

I went here for dinner on Friday night.  It was about 8 and the place was pretty dead which was odd yet nice.  I guess this place does a fair amount of pickup orders so that is probably why the place had only 3 or 4 more people sitting down to dine.  You order your food the same way during dinner as you do at lunch.  Even-though it wasn't busy and there was no line to order, it is still a weird process that doesn't flow so smoothly if you are dining with 3-4 people that order a combination of salads and grilled items.  I ordered the tri-tip dinner with a side of candied carrots and mac and cheese all with a side Caesar salad.  The Caesar was better this time because I think they used more dressing.  The tri-tip was phenomenal; tender, juicy and cooked over a flame right before your eyes.  The candied carrots were also excellent but how can any vegetable with the word "candy" in it?  The mac was just so-so and nothing special.  I can't wait to come back to try some more of their stuff but I doubt I'll ever make it past the tri-tip.

This was my 3rd trip to The Keg. If you are in the mood for some good steak or prime rib at a semi-reasonable price then The Keg is your place. The Keg is not as nice nor as pricey as the upper echelon steak places in the Phoenix area. It is not Mastros, Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris. The Keg is a very good mid-range steak place. And I honestly can't think of another steak place like it in the same range. If I were in the mood for an excellent, moderately priced steak and didn't want to splurge on Mastros, then I would probably go to The Keg.  I split the rib eye and it was more than enough for both of us. The flavor was excellent and they cooked it properly. The garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms were also very good. I especially enjoyed the Caesar salad I had to start.

My wife and I needed a quick dinner before a wine tasting event at BevMo (excellent event...talk to Jim the manager @ BevMo for details).  Anyway, we sat at the bar.  The bartender (John) was great!  My wife and I can never turn down cheap drinks at happy hour so she had a glass of wine and I had the orange slice martini.  The martini was very good but not strong enough.  When you sit down they give you a little bowl of homemade kettle chips.  O-M-G soooo good.  Next time I go I'm just going to order drinks and eat those chips.    We split a Caesar salad which was very good and enough for both of us.  For the main course my wife had the ground prime rib burger and I had the blu burger.  They were both excellent and full of flavor and juicy goodness.  I would definitely order them again!

Went here last night for happy hour (M-F, 5-7).  They have a bunch of alcohol specials but we stuck to wine.  It was 1/2 off all their glasses.  They have some decent selections with nothing to crazy or expensive.  I recommend their "keg" size pours which are 9 ounces versus the regular 6.  3 of those equals a bottle, FYI.  For food they don't really have anything special on their happy hour menu so we ordered off the regular bar menu.  *seared tuna = excellent *sliders = very good *sirloin Caesar  = pretty good but I think it is over priced at $15.  I also had like 2 bowls of those chips.  OMFG they are so good.  The service was surprising fast and friendly.  I'm used to happy hours where it takes forever to get food and drinks and waitstaff that are flustered.  I will be back but I do think they need some better selections on their happy hour menu food wise.  It also wouldn't hurt to have a normal martini or other vodka based drink on the happy hour menu.

I went here last night for happy hour / dinner and my opinion of this place is slipping.  Their happy hour drink menu got a lot smaller.  Plus, there are no well drink specials to be found.  Also, the bar area is just too busy for 1-2 waitresses.  It gets frustrating when you have to wait too long for a drink or ask several times for more of those awesome chips.  We probably would have stayed longer and spent more money if it wasn't such a pain to order more stuff.  Anyway, we had a few drinks and some appetizers.  All the appetizers are excellent.  Last time I went I told myself I wanted to try their filet.  So this time I did and it was just ok.  It wasn't worth $25 and why they wrap it in bacon I will never know.  However, it was cooked properly and was tender and pretty flavorful.  I also had their wedge salad was was excellent.

I don't really like places like Chili's and Applebees (I think they are the same thing) but have gotten roped into going on several occasions.  I generally view their food as unhealthy and nothing special.  Lunch today was no exception and I would have liked to eat almost anywhere else.  Anyway, my employer was buying so what the heck.  Upon arriving I noticed that this had to be one of the nicest Chili's i have ever been to.  I must have been recently remodeled.  It was actually pretty nice!  Our party of 7 was seated promptly and the waiter was quick to take our order.  He was very friendly, quick, didn't make mistakes and most importantly was fast with my diet coke refills.  It was very good service considering the size of our party and it was the weekday  "lunch rush".  Here is my breakdown:  * Queso dip and chips - Of course my group had to order this because it was exactly what I needed....a yummy mess of cholesterol and calories.  Plus, I swear the stuff is addicting.  The chips are fresh and good and their salsa is also somehow very good and spicy.  * Chicken Fajitas - I thought this to be one of their healthier meal options so I decided to give it a try.  They were very good.  I didn't have the tortillas, guac or the sour cream, but it didn't matter.  The sauteed onions, peppers, chicken and whatever else were very good all on their own.  I licked my plate clean.  * Lava Cake topped with ice cream- Why do my coworkers do this to me?  I had a few bites and it was excellent.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself.  The same goes for that other dessert we got.  It was some ice cream over a brownie thing.  I can't believe I'm giving this place 4 stars but it really wasn't too bad.  I won't rush back but won't be opposed to going either.

This is the exact same thing as Thai Basil down the street.  However, Thai Elephant is more expensive, serves alcohol, and you can order just a cup of soup instead of an enormous bowl.  But don't get me wrong... both Thai Basil and Thai Elephant serve EXCELLENT food and the service is great.

First of all the address on here is all jacked up and the map thing puts the location somewhere in Chandler.  This made it difficult to check in which pissed me off.  Anyway, I made the correction on the edit business page so lets see if Yelp makes the update.  Anyway, I don't really like places like this so I wasn't excited to eat here.  I'm just not a fan of the whole cookie cutter chain thing where everything comes from a frozen package and warmed up in the microwave.  However, to my surprise, this place is pretty solid even if everything comes frozen.  I sat at the bar with a few friends to have lunch.  I ordered the sliders and they were surprisingly very good.  At like 10 bucks for 2 sliders they are a rip off but not too shabby.  I had the buffalo ones and I also tried the zucchini ones which were excellent.  The salad bar was also very good and at $1 more it was a bargain.  Everything on the bar was fresh and clean.  Oh and the 50 cent wine tasting was great.  We had to do it if only for the novelty.  The wine is only ok but who can argue at 50 cents?  Our bartender / waitress was excellent and friendly.  Am I going to rush back?  No.  But if I am in the area and am craving a salad and a burger, yes, I would be back.

I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that that's a bad thing because I don't like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like you're in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiter's first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok.  I was pissed we couldn't get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf?  I'm a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didn't like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst I've ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).  Here is a rundown of the food:  * bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top * tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella. * pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels. * burger - pretty solid but nothing special * mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again. * tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.  The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time.   I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return.

My wife and I needed a ride to the airport to catch a flight to start our honeymoon.  As to not bother any of our friends/family for a ride at 5am, I decided it would be best to hire a taxi.  The reviews for this service on Yelp looked ok so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I went to their website and scheduled my pickup (http://www.ridecharge.com/s/az-phoenix-tucson/taxi/branded/vip_allstate) and it went smoothly.  I was actually pretty impressed with their website (http://www.viptaxi.com/) and online scheduling functionality.  Soon after I received an automated email confirmation and text message.  After verifying all the information on the confirmation email and text message, I felt secure in the fact that I would be picked up on time and without incident.  I felt so secure that I didn't even call them the day before to confirm my pickup.  This was a HUGE mistake.  The time of my pickup came and went so gave them a call using the number that was listed on the confirmation email.  I spoke to a nice young lady who proceeded to tell me that they had no record of my pickup reservation.   Lucky for me I left a big cushion of time just in case something like this should happen.  Anyway, the girl sent a taxi and 30 minutes later one arrived.  I didn't miss the flight and it all worked out, but I will never again use this service.  I agree with most of the reviews on here though; the cab was pretty nasty but the driver was great.  Oh, and the greatest part is that I received TWO automated email "Thank You's" sent from their ridiculous online "booking" system.

I was in the area and decided to give this place a shot.  It was about 1ish and the place wasn't crowded at all.  They had like a zillion TVs and a interactive video game thingy at every booth which was very neat.  If there was a Buffalo Wild Wings near my house and I was into sports I would definitely stay there for hours to drink, eat and watch games.  So about the food....  Since it is almost the new year and I want to start it off right, I opted out of the typical wings because they are fried and breaded.  I just don't understand why wing places haven't figured out that they can just bake their wings and they will be just as good?  Anyway,  my wife and I each ordered the Naked Tenders and side salads.  The tenders came with whatever sauces you want so we got 5 to try.  My wife didn't like any of them but my favorite was the parmesan garlic.  The spicy garlic wasn't too bad but anything hotter than that was just too hot for us.  We both thought the tenders were very good and simple.  They are also a very healthy option if you don't dip them in too much sauce so I tried not to.  The salad was also pretty good.  The service was pretty fast and friendly so no complaints there.  Though I probably won't be back to this particular location because I am almost never in the area, I will go to another Buffalo Wild Wings in the future to try some other wings and sauces.

I went here Friday night with a party of 5.  My wife and I arrived a bit early to check out their bar and to have a cocktail.  The inside and outside of the bar has a great vibe.  Between the relaxed upscale atmosphere, great martinis (with blue cheese olives of course), friendly bar tenders, and the bowls of snacks; I could have sat there all night.  However, I was on a mission to eat an awesome steak so I had to press on....  Here are the highlights because just about everything to say has already been said on here:  * Popover - WOW! Light, airy, chewey perfection.  The butter and sea salt was a nice touch. * Tuna Tartar - very good  * Caesar Salad - excellent and enough to share  * Ribeye - this was probably the best ribeye I've ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and wasn't too fatty.  The only negatives of this place are the sides.  They are small, over-priced for their size, and not memorable at all.  Next time I'm going to try the french fries and/or the mashed potatoes.  * Gnocchi - the gnocchi themselves were excellent, but the sauce was just eh.  It was just a regular pasta sauce it seemed like * Maccaroni - not good at all.  They used weird cheese and big pieces of ham or something. * Potato Gratin  - just eh * Carrots and Asparagus -  these 2 sides were very good and I would order them again.   The 2 desserts the table sampled were equally as "eh" as the sides.  Anyway, the steak was fabulous and I want to return for it.  The service was equally as good as our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.

I can't really say anything that hasn't been said over and over again in previous review.  Great service, phenomenal food, fair prices, and healthy portions.  This place is truly unique and I would come back over and over again.  However, I'm still not a fan of them not accepting credit cards which pisses me off to no end.  The personal call from the chef/owner a few days prior to our meal to confirm our reservation and other details is an excellent touch.  I would however have loved for him to drop by my table at some point during the meal.  I actually thought it was odd that he didn't.  Anyway, this is a great place and highly recommended.

This place is very interesting and there is nothing else like it in the Phoenix area.  Though I am not some health nut, vegan, vegetarian, or allergic to gluten; I found this restaurant to be very good.  The decor is very unique and trendy with an open kitchen and prep stations so you can see just how "fresh" your food is.  The hostess was friendly and it took about 10 minutes for our party of 3 to be seated on this busy Thursday night.  All 3 of us shared the Harvest Chopped Salad.  It was very tasty and served all of us quite nicely.  I would definitely order this salad again.  Our entrees (natural half chicken, sustainable salmon, and spaghetti squash spaghetti) were all very tasty and reasonably priced.  I would order any of the 3 again.  We did not order dessert this visit, but I would recommend the maple ice cream thing.  I had that last time and it was very good.  I think they make all the desserts from scratch because it took forever.  Anyway, the waiter was friendly and the food, drinks and refills were delivered rather quickly.  I would definitely dine here again because the food is excellent, reasonably priced, friendly service, and most importantly....makes me feel hip, trendy and healthy!

I went here last night with a party of 4.  I couldn't believe how crowded this place was for being 8pm on a Tuesday.  We didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a table inside so we sat on the patio.  It was hot as heck outside but they had an AC unit out there and it actually wasn't bad at all.  We didn't order any drinks but I am for sure next time.  I have to try one of their margaritas.    Here is a rundown of the eats:  *Chips = fresh and perfectly salted  *Salsa = just eh - it had almost no spice and tasted too tomato pasty for me  *Guacamole = phenomenal - they make it table side and you can make it exactly how you like it which in my case was with all the fixins' and spicy - it was awesome, just awesome  * Poblano Grits = creamy and delicious  * Street Corn = o-m-g - this was my favorite.  I could probably eat buckets of the stuff.  The sauce stuff they put on it is just amazing creamy spicy goodness.  Probably not too healthy though but it doesn't matter because it was fantastic.  * Tacos (I tried the chicken, steak and squash) = very very good.  The only problem is that they were tiny.  They are literally 2 inches in diameter and at over 4 bucks a pop (you get 3) it kind of pissed me off.  I know it is more than enough food but it still angered me.  Anyway, each one I had was excellent.  The meat was perfectly flavored and juicy and all the ingredients on the taco worked well together.  I also loved our waiter.  He was very friendly, funny and engaging.  He was so passionate about the place and its food it was almost as if he was the owner or had a stake in the place.  Enough said.  I cannot wait to return.  I'm still pissed about the size and price of those tacos though.

This place annoys me.  First off, who the heck knows how big an ounce of yogurt/toppings are?  They clearly mark their price at 39 cents an ounce for the yogurt and whatever toppings you want.  This doesn't sound like a lot, but the person in front of me in the yogurt "buffet" line was charged $7 for his bowl of yogurt.  I was a bit smarter and only filled up my bowl a small amount.  Anyway, they should offer you a few different bowl sizes, but I bet they are banking on the fact that people will go overboard and fill the large bowls to the brim with junk.    Lets back up a bit though.  Sometimes I enjoy tasting the yogurt before I committ to having it in my bowl.  Like at Golden Spoon (by far the best yogurt place) where they offer you a little cup which they fill up with the yogurt so you can actually try it.  Yogurtini has no such thing or so I thought.  Turns out you have to walk up to the counter and ask for a little cup because they don't feel like putting them next to the yogurt dispensers where it would actually be useful.  Anyway, a member of my party didn't know about the little cups and stuck her finger under the yogurt dispenser thing, pulled the lever, and had a taste.  It looked harmless enough until we saw several other people do the same thing with their dirty nasty fingers.  Anyway, the actual yogurt and flavors were just ok but not even close to Golden Spoon.  Yogurtini does however have a good selection of toppings.  I did not partake, but if you are a drunk and/or stoned college kid with $10, I'd say have a blast and fill your bowl with yogurt, coco crispies, hot tamales, and marshmallows!

I do not understand why everyone and their mother is opening up trendy burger places.  Actually, I think I'm going to open one up on Scottsdale Road and Shea and charge about $15 for a dry and tasteless burger.  Oh wait, there already is a place there called Indulge Burger.  Anyway, here is my Indulge Burger experience:  The place was pretty crowded on this Tuesday evening at about 6:30.  Upon seating they gave us a small plate of their garlic and parmesan chips, gratis.  The menu is strait forward and simple and I like that you can just check off what you want like when you order sushi.  There were plenty of options to choose from including different burger toppings and sauces which looked interesting.  Anyway, to start I split a ceasar salad.  It was almost big enough for 2 people, but the salad was not good and I probably shouldn't have ordered it.  Now onto the burger....    First off, I was going to indulge and splurge on a $14 Kobe burger, but I guess a lot of other suckers came in that day so they were out of it.  So, I decided on the regular beef instead.  I ordered the 2/3rd pound version ($10.75) with gyuere cheese (included), grilled onions (included), roasted green chili peppers (included), and sauteed mushrooms ($0.99).  I got this all on a bed of lettuce instead of a bun.  We also got one order of regular fries and one order of sweet potato fries to share.  The other 2 members of my party ordered similar burgers as well as a few different dipping sauces.  I must admit that the burger looked very good when it came out.  However, when I actually tasted the thing and the toppings, it was a much different story.  The meat was dry and almost tasteless and the onions, chilies and mushrooms all tasted like they had just come out of a can.  The sweet potato fries were ok, but the regular fries were excellent.  Also, most of the dipping sauces were tasty, but just don't belong on burgers and fries.   The food arrived very slowly and drink refills took forever.  I don't really blame the waiter/waitress because the place was busy and they looked understaffed.  However, they were very friendly and helpful.  It was about $50ish dollars for all 3 of us to eat and we all felt raped for spending so much on a few burgers.  With places like Delux out there I can see no reason to return to Indulge Burger.

If you are looking for something small, hip and trendy then this is your place.  Great atmosphere here.  My party of 4 arrived pretty early last night (Saturday) and there were only 2 others in the place.  I really like uncrowded bars but I feel this place gets pretty crowded later in the evening.  We were there for about an hour and it was starting to get busy before we left.  We all sat at the bar to chat up the bar tender.  He was super cool, friendly and made great drinks.  We tried a couple of their signature drinks and they were all very good and unique to say the least.  I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything on their signature drink list.  Just remember they are all pretty sweet and not that strong.  After sampling a few of their signature drinks I needed something a little stronger so I ordered up a martini.  It was good but I was bummed that they didn't have blue cheese olives which are my fav in martinis.  However, they do have nice big pretzels to munch on at the bar if you ask nicely.  All-in-all it is a solid bar but I would  hate the place if it got crowded. It is also only about a 10 minute walk from the light rail.

The food is not very good here.  You can get much better Mexican food (if you can even call it that) in the Phoenix area.  The price is a bit high for what you get, but it still isn't very expensive.  Our waiter was was good, but the food took forever to arrive.  The place was worth a try, but we would not return.

Somehow I had never heard of this place until Saturday so I had no idea what to expect.  We had a giant party of 9 people so it took a while to get seated, but after that everything ran surprisingly well considering the size of the group.  The food came pretty fast and my diet coke was never empty.  Our waitress/servers were all excellent.  Because I read some Yelp reviews before my visit, I was pretty confident that the burger was a good choice.  I ordered "The Gladiator" and it was excellent.  The toppings, meat and bun were all top notch, fresh and tasty tasty and I would definitely order it again.  I only had a bite or 2 with the delicious pretzel bun so it made sense in my head to order the fries.  I ordered the combo fries which are half regular and half sweet potato.  I didn't really like them and would order another side in the future like the hash which sounds interesting.  Anyway, the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and not overly greasy, but I think they lacked flavor.  After tasting their burger and studying their menu I can't wait to go back.  Their breakfast menu has TONS of things that look awesomely delicious and can't wait to try them.  I just wish this place was in a different/larger location because I could tell that the place gets jam packed in the morning and I bet the parking is a pain.

Love.  This.  Place.  It is not cheap and I'm pretty sure I had a mild heart attack from all the fat and sodium I ingested; but oh so worth it.  Not the best cuts of meat and some pieces are a bit fatty but this is pretty much a meat lovers paradise.  I went here as part of a ginormous 30-person party and everything went pretty smoothly considering our group's size.  The staff was very professional and tried to keep everything straight even though things got a little bit hectic.  Can't wait to return.

I didn't purchase my car here but this is where I get it serviced because it is the closest Toyota/Scion dealership to my house.  I like it that they have relatively easy online service scheduling.  After I schedule my appointment I get like 3 calls and 3 emails to follow up and confirm but when I show up they have no idea who I am or why I am there.  I've been there about 5 times so far and I go through this every single time.  I'm starting to think that you don't really have to schedule an appointment and you can just show up whenever for whatever.  Each time I go and they are clueless about it; they just check my car in and do what they have to do.  90% of the time my car is ready to go without incident and by the time they said it would be.  The hours of the place also work well with my schedule.  So far they have never been too busy to take my car and get it done on time.  I may be stupid for servicing my car at the dealership and paying a higher price, but I do like the piece of mind in knowing that everything will most likely be done correctly.  I've only had basic service done so far and the prices have been pretty reasonable I think.  All the service advisers are very friendly and seem to be knowledgeable.  I think they really try to make the process as painless as possible.   Anyway, I will be coming back every 5,000 miles until they screw me over and/or ruin my car.

This is a weird place.  Situated in a typical N. Scottdale strip mall, you would expect this place to be your standard bar and grill type place.  Well you would be 1/2 correct.  It is a standard bar and grill but Lousiana/Creole style.  Anyway, it is very odd for the place's name, location and look but then again I'll eat anything so what the heck.  I went there last night (Tuesday) at about 6pm because it sounded like a pretty good happy hour.  My wife and I were meeting 2 other people there so we figured we'd get there early for drinks/appetizers.  Upon entering we noticed how small the place actually was.  Probably about a dozen tables and another 12 or so chairs around the bar.  The patio was defiantly bigger and less crowded so we sat there even though it was pretty hot outside.  They have misters n' stuff so it wasn't bad at all.  While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive we each had a drink and split Burbon Street Boil which is basically shell-on shrimp that have been boiled in some type of creole stuff.  It was excellent and I would come back just for that.  The shrimp were very flavorful and had just the right amount of kick.  For dinner I wasn't in the mood for jambalaya or gumbo so I decided on a standard burger.  I meant to order the burger with andouille sausage for some Lousiana flair, but ordered their other burger by mistake.  It was very good though and the fries that came with were very good as well.  I'm still pretty pissed that I ordered the wrong burger though.  I also ordered their wedge salad to start and it was ok.  I know I shouldn't have expected a standard wedge but that is what I was in the mood for.  It was a Romain wedge instead of an iceberg one.  All the typical ingredients were there but the dressing had a kick to it and there were candied walnuts mixed in the salad.  It was pretty good but not really my style.  My wife ordered the shrimp and ancho tacos and they were excellent.  I could eat those things all day long.  The sauce had some good heat to it which is nice and the shrimp were pretty large as well.  Our waitress was pretty much a space case but was very friendly and helpful.  Not sure what she was doing when she would disappear for 15 minutes at a time but whatever.  Anyway, I would like to come back to get serious with their Louisiana cuisine and try some gumbo, etoufee and jambalaya.

FYI...awesome deal on LocalDines, http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ.  I wish I had known about it on my last visit.  $20 to get a $40 cert.  No restrictions like on restaurant.com.

I have my home warranty through Fidelity and this is the company they always use to fix my plumbing issues.  They are very responsive and call me right away to schedule a visit.  Thankfully I haven't had any emergencies where I needed them ASAP, but they always seem to be able to come out the same or next day if needed.  The only bummer is that, like all services like this probably, the time windows in which they will come to you suck.  Like HUGE blocks of time that you have to wait at home and basically ruins your entire day.  They will however give you a call when they are on their way which I guess is better than nothing.  Anyway, all the plumbers who have come to my house are knowledgeable, friendly and do solid work.  However, I can't comment on their prices because I just pay a small deductible to my home warranty company and they take care of it.  * Pro Tip - No matter what number you call to get Alan's Plumbing, 80% of the time you will get a busy signal.  Just keep trying and eventually you will get through.  It is frustrating but they always pickup and are almost always friendly.

I went here Saturday night with a party of 4.  It is a pretty neat place in a neat area.  I felt pretty hip and urban being there.  Anyway, I NEVER eat pasta because I "try" to stay away from those carbs, so even coming here was a giant step for me.  I wasn't expecting the pasta here to be anything great but boy was I wrong.  Each one that I tried was excellent.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious and each was very flavorful.  I don't remember exactly which ones I tried (I tried 4 of them), but each one was excellent.  They probably don't make a bad pasta dish.  Some of the dishes have some odd/random ingredients, but don't let that scare you.  Order each dish as it is listed on the menu and you won't be disappointed.   When I feel like I have to get carbed up for a big race I will return!  I'm still a little pissed that they didn't have diet coke or any diet soda at all for that matter.  Who doesn't have diet soda?  I get that they are trying to be green, local, natural, organic or whatever else is hip right now but come on.  I know I should probably stick to water anyway, but I always enjoy a diet coke with any good meal.  I'm not sure why, but I just love it and it makes my meal a lot more enjoyable.  Weird, I know.

Lamar's donuts came very highly recommended by a coworker so my boss brought some to the office for everyone to try.  My favorite go-to donut is the Boston Cream so I decided to sample that one first.  It was good but tasted like a Boston Cream donut from just about anywhere else.  It wasn't until after I tried the Boston Cream that I was told about how the chocolate glazed were the real special ones.  So I gave that one a shot and WOW.... it actually was very very good and dare I say outstanding.  Crispy cream and Dunkin can suck it!

This place could be a really great neighborhood spot.  It has great potential but the food misses the mark completely.  They serve the stuff that is left over in your pantry/fridge but don't want to make so you decide to go out instead.  For example they use canned salmon on top of their "salmon salad".  I mean how hard is grilling a piece of frozen salmon?  Their "salmon tacos" are the same thing.  Their menu is all over the map and needs to be cut down by 50%.  Its just a bunch of random bar food.  They should choose just a few things and do them well.  Not 40 things microwaved poorly.  Don't even get me started on their ice.  It makes their drinks disgusting.  I'm almost positive it is lake water.  Our server was nice but a complete clusterfuk.  It took 15 minutes to get dressing for a salad.  Not more dressing, just dressing period because they just forgot to put it on.  I will eat and drink almost anything anywhere but I have to draw the line somewhere.

My wife and I went here for a lil evening snack and some wine.  We are big fans of the other Postino (LOVE the bruschetta).  This was my first time here and my wife's second. We arrived at about 8pm and were seated right away.  The place kinda sorta looks just like their other location and had the same chill vibe going on.  The service was fast and friendly as always.  We each had a glass of wine and split the grilled cheese (totally random I know).  I am always impressed with their wine selection.  They have some good stuff that will appeal to just about everybody and it is all reasonably priced.  Anyway, the wine was good and the grilled cheese was just ok.  I'm not a fan of grilled cheese where the bread is real crispy and big.  Also, I'm not sure of the cheese they used but I wasn't a fan either.  It was just eh.  It wasn't horrible, but I won't order it again.  Hmmmm....maybe if it came with a bowl of tomato soup ....  My only gripe about this location as well as their other one is the parking.  It is ALWAYS a clusterfuq.  I mean good for them for always being so busy, but it really is a pain in the ass.

I think this place used to be the Half Moon Sports Grill and have been there once before.  The place still looks basically the same on the inside.  It was a Monday night and we were looking for a quick bite to eat so we figured why not give this place a try.  Thinking back, I believe that the happy hour specials as well as the menu items were about the same as what the Half Moon Grill offered.    It was about 6:30 on a Monday night and the place was basically dead so we we seated right away and had our choice of table.  Our waitress was fast and friendly and we ordered up a couple beers, a salad and some burgers.  The burgers were a good size, not frozen or pre-cooked and were topped with fresh ingredients.  The fries were good as well and were hand cut.  We also tried the homemade kettle chips and they were excellent.  I could probably eat them all day.  It was about $40 including tip for everything.  If I am in the area again and want a decent burger, have a beer and watch a game; I would definitely come back.

I can't believe this is something new for parties/events.  I've been to a bunch of different events and have never seen this type of thing before.  Sure, events always have random people taking pictures which can be fun, but SnapBooth is a bit more fun in my opinion.  It is basically just a photo booth thing where you go inside, make some silly faces, and out pops your photos.  Their staff is super friendly and helpful and they even have some fun hats n' stuff for you to put on  for your pictures.  The whole process is pretty fun.  The only thing I didn't like was the line to get inside the thing.  So if you plan an event, make sure you rent enough of the units.

I am a huge fan of Picazzo's.  I don't remember what their pizza is like because it has been so long since I had it, but if there is one thing I always remember, it is their salads.  They are HUGE and awesome.  I absolutely love their wedge.  I swear the small is an entire head of lettuce.  Anyway, this Picassos seems to have the same stuff as all the rest around town and their service staff is just as helpful and friendly as the other locations.  This place is great if you care about organic, gluten free, blah blah blah stuff.  I don't really care about that stuff but I guess it is a plus when I'm chowing down on a wedge the size of my head.  Also, the Mama's Meat-Za Balls are just 'eh.  The meat is nitrate free so maybe that's why I didn't like them so much cuz I love me some nitrates.  They are worth a shot but this is not one of their better appetizers.  Anyway, I love this place and hope to be back soon.

I went here for dinner with a large party on a Sunday evening.  We had a reservation so we didn't have to worry about a long wait but we did have to wait until our entire party arrived to be seated which I guess is pretty normal.  The 20 or so minutes I had to wait for my entire party to arrive was more than enough to explore the Clarendon which might be the most hipster place I've ever been.  I didn't really fit in because I am pretty preppy but I don't care.  They could have made the place a bit nicer, but I guess that wasn't the look they were going for.  It still looks like a nicer motel that has been redone half-assed.   My table shared a bunch of appetizers like the guac, grilled corn, and some sort of cheese dip thing that I forget the name of.  All were excellent.  They don't give you near enough guac tho for $7.  However, it was some darn good guac.  For my entree I ordered the  1/2 Pollo Asado and it was tender, juicy, and delicious.  My only complaint is that it comes on a plate that is too small so it was a pain in the ass to eat and not make a complete mess of myself and the table.  I would order it again.  I also sampled the Chilaquiles and several tacos.  Everything was delicious.  I especially loved the chips and salsa.  The red one in the bottle is perfect.  Not too spicy, not too watery, full of flavor...just perfect.  The chips were fresh, thick, and not greasy.  Service was fast and friendly and they prices are reasonable except for the tacos and guac.  I can't wait to return.

This was basically my first time moving so I really had no idea how to mange the entire process.  I also couldn't afford to screw this up in terms of time and money.  So naturally the first place I looked was Yelp for a solid moving company.  I really couldn't argue with a place with such stellar reviews by fellow Yelpers so I decided to give them a try.  I talked to Justin a week or so before my move to set everything up and get some questions answered.  He was friendly and professional and setting everything up was a breeze.  On the day of my move, the 2 movers showed up a bit early (huge plus) in a UHAUL which I thought was a bit sketchy but is a pretty genius way to do things if you have your own busy and growing moving company.  The movers began working right away.  They were courteous, fast and professional.  They also went above and beyond by taking apart and reassembling a bed and a large desk that I didn't have time to deal with myself.  Anyway, the entire move-out and move-in process was a lot quicker and easier than I thought and went off without a hitch.  I would definitely recommend Just-In Time to anyone and would definitely use them again.

I had no idea this place existed until it showed up in the Phoenix Magazine as a top spot.  After reading several Yelp reviews it seemed like a solid place to try.  My party of about 10 or so people showed up around 7:30ish on a Monday night.  We were seated promptly as they set aside a nice corner of the patio for us.  It was a bit chili outside but it wasn't too bad because they have a fire and a few heaters going.  The ambiance is very nice (reminds me of the Vig for some reason) and as described in tons of the Yelp reviews.  Also as described in a bunch of the reviews is the service.  Most people say it is no bueno, but it really isn't that horrible.  Yes our waitress was a bit of a space case, but she was very fast and friendly so we had no real complaints.  The place was pretty packed for a Monday night, but our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time.  Here is what I sampled:  Cauliflower Gratinata - this is not that spectacular and I probably wouldn't order it again.  It is just baked cauliflower and cheese.  I could make this better at home.  Parlor Insalata - this is very good and I would order it again but without the olives if I could.  The crispy chickpeas are a nice touch.  Roast Beet salad - I only had a single taste, but it was excellent.  Fries - eh  Salsiccia pizza - excellent.  I would order it again.  Spicy Barbecue Chicken Pizza - I normally hate bbq chicken type pizzas but this one was very good.  The added jalepenos were a nice touch and added just the right amount of heat.  Funghi - outstanding.  I am going to order this one for sure next time.  As far as the pizza is concerned, I can compare it to Pizzeria Bianco, Grazies and maybe La Boca (btw I haven't had Humble Pie yet but its on my list of to-do's).  Anyway, unless I have all the pizzas side by side I really can't decide which is better.  All I can say is that the crust is very good.  Not too crunchy, not too chewy.  Not too hard, not too floppy.  Though I didn't have any, their drinks look very good.  Next time maybe I'll try one of their "mashed" drinks which seem interesting.  All their mixed drinks including the mashes look very unique and worth a try.  They also have a decent selection of beer and wines and they all look to be reasonably priced.  Next time, along with a pizza or 2, I'd like to try one of their burgers which look excellent as well as a pasta dish.  Ok well maybe It will take me 2 or 3 more visits to try everything I want, but I'm ok with it  :-)  Anyway, I highly recommend this place and will hopefully dine here again sometime in the very near future.

Last night was my 2nd visit to this place in 3 years which is far too long between visits.  I love love love this place.  The decor, service, and food are all top notch. Here is the rundown of our meal:  Roasted Brussels Sprouts = excellent Caesar Salad = excellent Mozzarella en Corrozza (Crispy House Made Mozzarella) Salad = excellent Roasted Corn Pizza = excellent Pesto Pizza = excellent Funghi Pizza = excellent Pepperoni Pizza = excellent  I literally cannot say enough good things about the food here.  I could write a page on each one of the pizzas, but then I would get hungry and carbs are my enemy.  The only thing that fell short was the Arancine (Crispy Saffron Risotto).  It was a fried ball of risotto with marinara sauce.  It was just ok to me.  Can't wait to return.

They have some nice stuff at ok prices.  Just a few things to remember:  * If you order something from their website that is out of stock, they say your card will not be charged until it ships.  This is a lie.  My wife and I ordered a daybed that was out of stock and not due to be shipped for over a week but not to worry because they wouldn't charge us until the thing shipped.  This place pretty much did the opposite by charging us right away for something that wasn't shipped for 3 weeks.  * Organizing the delivery of an item is a clusterfuk.  You have to deal with 17 different people who don't care and are each dumber than the last.  I'm pretty sure they wait until they have a full truck and delivery route before they will bother they deliver your stuff regardless of what date range they told you.

After hearing a lot of buzz about this place over the last few weeks I decided that I had better try it.  I've previously never heard of Tasti D-Lite but I learned it is big in New York and after trying it I think it will be big here as well.  I'm always looking for desserts that are tasty yet won't make me fatter or send me into carb/calorie overload so I was very excited to try this place.  Tasti D-Lite's main thing is that it is supposed to have very calorie-lite and tasty frozen yogurt/ice cream type stuff.  Although I'm still not sure if it is ice cream or frozen yogurt.  They even have a nutritional comparison with most of the other ice cream/frozen yogurt places so you can see how this place stacks up.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Upon entering the place you will notice that it doesn't look that much different than the 75 other frozen yogurt places that have sprung up around the valley over the past couple years.  What you WILL notice is that each of their frozen treat offerings clearly show the amount of calories in it.  Friggin GENIUS!  Almost every other food selling establishment should take the hint from Tasti D-Lite and start doing this.  I understand that the average Joe doesn't care how many calories are in what he eats, but I think a lot of people would be way better off if they are given proper nutritional information of what goes into their mouths.  So far I was impressed.  The place was nice and clean, the girl behind the counter (Megan) was very helpful and friendly, the prices were reasonable, etc.   BUT....did the stuff taste any good for having only a few calories per bite?  After sampling every one of their 5 or so flavors I was quite surprised.  Everything pretty much tasted like what it was supposed to and actually were very good.  It wasn't the best frozen yogurt stuff I've ever eaten, but it is pretty good.  Its not the creamiest, richest, or sweetest, but it is quite satisfying.  For under 100 calories for a small cup you can't go wrong.  But don't worry, you can still load your cup with the usual not-so-good-for-you toppings.  Listen, if you want something that tastes like Chunky Monkey then this is not your place.  But if you want some decent frozen yogurt stuff that is lite on your wallet and calories, then pay Tasti D-Lite a visit.

I still have no idea what this place is.  I only know that my dog needed some pills to treat his valley fever and for some reason the vet didn't carry them so I was sent here.  The whole process is pretty painless and I think their drugs are priced reasonably.  They will also hand deliver the medication the same day if you ask nicely.  Pro Tip:  When you call, don't hang up right away when you get the recorded message.  When you stay on the line it will begin to ring again and someone may answer.  I thought the recorded message was an answering machine and hung up prematurely a few times.  Also, sometimes the line just rings and rings and rings.  Be patient and someone will probably pick up.

Great little place to stop for coffee.  I love it that each of their coffee drinks can be made iced AND sugar/fat free.  I went here the other day and the guy working was super friendly and fast.  I will return.

I agree this place isn't perfect and is a bit unorganized.  However, my wife and I get a kick-ass workout for a very reasonable price.  I'm trying to get my fat ass a bit more active and really wanted to learn how to box so this place looked like a perfect fit.  After a 30 minute session with Michael I was hooked.  I got a killer workout and am learning to box at the same time.  Michael seems to be a veteran boxer and an excellent instructor.  If you are curious, here is how he structures the session:  5 mins - warm up cardio and putting on your wraps and gloves 15 mins - hardcore boxing stuff 10 mins - abs/cardio/general strength and endurance stuff  15 minutes of boxing does seem like much but it is pretty intense.  I wish I could do that for the full 30 mins but there is just no way because I run out of steam pretty quickly.  However, I'm learning the basics and my stamina will build over time.

A/C hasn't worked in WEEKS.  I decided to skip asking someone in charge about it because I really don't care to hear excuses.  I just want it fixed so I don't almost pass out every time I box.  ** Michael is still awesome though.  Gives a great workout. **

This was my first experience with Cuban food.  My wife and I went with another couple who are familiar with Cuban cuisine and Mimita's.  They raved about it so my expectations were high.  They assured me that the food, atmosphere and staff were all excellent and authentic.    We went on a Friday night at about 8ish and the place was about 1/3rd full.  The place is kinda small and has a great Cuban vibe to it.  There was a band in the corner jammin' out Cuban style which was awesome.  Several people even got up to dance.  My wife and I almost did as well but we didn't want to embarrass ourselves.  Anyway, it was enough to just sit there sipping a freshly made mojito while listening to the tunes.  Our waiter was awesome, friendly, fast and offered up some good suggestions.  He was also the bartender.  He made our mojitos from scratch and they came out excellent, though a bit too sweet, but awesome nonetheless.  Here is an overview of our meal:  * #8 EJEMPLARES DE MIMITA'S (Mimita's Sampler) Appetizer - we ordered this so we were able to try as many things as possible.  We picked the yuca, tostones, and the papas rellenas.  We also ordered the mojo sauce on the side (saut√©ed garlic and onion with a hint of lime).  I liked the yuca the best which are basically big french fries but way better especially with the mojo sauce.  I wouldn't order the papas rellenas or tostones again because they were just ok.  * #43 POLLO DESHEBRADO - This was my entree.  It is basically shredded chicken in a light tomato based sauce and some rice and beans.  The dish looked awesome but I think it lacked flavor.  The chicken and sauce were pretty bland even with the sauce.  The rice/beans were ok as well.  However, I got the fried plantains with my dish and there were excellent.  Probably not the healthiest thing, but they were amazing.  I could eat those things all day long.  I also sampled the #42 BISTEC DE POLLO, #34 BISTEC ENCEBOLLADO, and the #31 ROPA VIEJA.  I hate to say this but I found each of them to be pretty bland.  I like that they make everything fresh and use lean cuts of meat and don't use tons of heavy sauces, but to me the things lacked flavor.  I was expecting an explosion of Cuban flare in my mouth but it was just bla.  For dessert we shared the #72 TRES LECHES and it was delicious.  I can't describe exactly what it is, but it was excellent.  I was later told that it wasn't even Cuban but was a Mexican dish.  Go figure...  I would rate the food here 3 stars and the service almost 5 stars.  Our waiter/bartender was excellent and one of the owners even came to our table to see if everything was good.  Most other restaurants don't care so this is a nice touch.  I'm not going to rush back here but if I am in the area and have a hankering for Cuban food, then I will definitely be back for the plantains and to try some other stuff.

I am a big fan of this place and probably eat here about once per month.  Most of the reviews on here are on point about the food.  The portions are big and reasonably priced and all it all tastes pretty good.  I really do think that the BFG organziation churns out some pretty decent Greek food.    However, I do have a complaint about this place in particular though.  The menu is waaaay to big and they offer waaaay too many choices.  I think they offer ribs now.  What is next?  Fish tacos? Steak?  I always dread going in here because I know its going to take me forever to mull over the menu and make a choice.  They have every conceivable Greek (and probably non-Greek) food item in every conceivable combination listed on their menu.  They seriously need to cut the thing in half and stick to a few main dishes.  Oh, and the bathroom is pretty gross.  Anyway, the food comes out quick and is very good.  I love the fresh pitas!

My wife and I went here last night after dinner for some custard.  We split a small cup of vanilla which was a mistake because after taking a few bites I wanted scoops more.  Anyway, the vanilla custard is fantastic!  Very rich, creamy, sweet and delicious.  I honestly cannot wait to have it again!!

I went here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Classic Double with fried cheese curds.  I was less than pleased with the confusing drive-thru situation and waiting time, but it was all ok once I got back to my office and saw/tasted the food.  The burger actually looks like it does in the picture and tasted just as great.  The burger was not too greasy, was full of flavor, and was held together perfectly with the bun thus no mess all over my desk and pants.  The cheese curds were also very good and pretty much what I expected from fried cheese.  I would definitely return.

I can't give this place 5 stars yet...but soon...maybe...I hope...  I wanted to take some type of boxing classes and this was the only place close to my home.  I'm really not into the boot camp type stuff that seems to be the cornerstone of every thing this place does, but I decided to give it a shot.  So last night I dragged my wife down there for our first boxing class.  It was an awesome workout and really kicked my ass.  It was difficult to make it the entire hour because you are going hardcore the entire time.  I'm not 100% sure because there are no clocks in the room, but there couldn't have been more than 30 minutes of actual boxing stuff.  It seemed to be more conditioning work than boxing drills and mechanics.     La Mar is a solid instructor and seems like a nice guy.  He had me motivated the entire time and gave me a killer workout.  The class size was a bit too large for my taste (about 15 people) but the large facility easily facilitated everyone.  I also think they need more punching bags for a ratio of 2 people per bag instead of 3 or 4.  Anyway, my wife and I are probably going to sign up for a few more classes and see how it goes.

I went here Saturday night with a party of 7.  It was about 8pm and the place was not that busy.  The owner came up to us right away to greet and seat us.  We were the only gringos in the place so this was a good sign.  I've only had Korean cuisine a handful of times so I'm not that good of a judge when talking about the authenticity or quality of the food.  However, everything I had was excellent.  The bbq ribs were bomb and so was my entree.  I still can't pronounce what my entree was, but it was rice, veggies, beef and egg in this 9,000 degree pot thing.  It was delicious and reminded me of awesome fried rice.  The best part of this place is the owner, HS or "Hot Stuff".  He is the most friendly, outgoing, and energetic Korean guy ever.  It is like dinner and a show with this guy.  Among other things takes saki-bombing to another level and makes it quite an event.  Although a bit pricey for what you get, this place is awesome and I can't wait to go back.  Its a fun, locally owned small business that puts out some decent and unique food.  Couple that with a character such as Hot Stuff and you can't miss.

I have been to Taste of Tops about a half dozen times because it is a pretty neat place and close to my house.  My wife and I went last night (Wednesday) with some friends at about 6pm and the place was pretty crowded.  I really don't like the place when it is crowded.  Thankfully the 2 couches they have were empty because I strongly prefer having a drink on a couch rather than at a regular table or on a bar stool.  Anyway, we took our seats and had a wine tasting which was their 'special' thing that evening.  4 pretty good pours for $5, not bad.  The wine selection was random but whatever.  My wife and I usually go there every once in a while for their beer.  They normally have 10ish interesting beers on tap and have new ones all the time.  We sit on the couch, chit chat, have a few beers and that is that.  The service is always pretty good and they all are encyclopedias of beer/wine/liquor knowledge.  I have yet to try any of their limited snack menu but I probably will soon.  They have 3 or 4 simple things that don't look to bad.  I just hate it when the place gets crowded.  It gets too loud and you have to yell to talk and struggle to listen to what others are saying.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but it certainly doesn't help that they play music louder than they should.  I think they should stick to a nice chill bar/lounge vibe.  I also think they should just stick to serving beer.

I'm your typical guy that doesn't really care about farmer's markets, shopping locally or being organic or 'green'.  I know that I should care for a multitude of reasons, but haven't been able to put forth the effort.  I guess it is just because it is more convenient to go to Fry's, Whole Foods, etc. to grocery shop.  While I'm not sure that will change much due to this market being less than a mile from my house, but this place may come in handy from time to time.  I can see myself coming here to pick up produce and other misc. stuff because the 2nd closest place to my house is Rollins Market and the produce there is pretty gross.  I just hate going all the way to Fry's to pick up a tomato or a small amount of other produce.  I'd just assume come here because it is way closer than Fry's and presumably fresher/greener/local-er/organic-er/etc.  I know the prices are a bit more than other places but it is to be expected because they don't deal in huge volumes that the other stores do.  Anyway, the place is pretty nice and has a pretty good selection of farmer's market type stuff.  The place is clean and the workers are very friendly.

I had been wanting to go here ever since it opened.  My wife was not thrilled because how good could a trendy steak joint in the mall be, right?  Well she was half right.  Honestly the place belongs in a hotel in Vegas.  The place is not intimate at all and you know you are in a mall (or one of those restaurants in a Vegas hotel).  The decor is ok but a bit over the top.  Sure, I prefer a more low key steak house, but this place was very interesting and great for people watching.  About the food:  * Bread they give you to start - I like it that they don't give you a bajilion pieces to fill up on and ruin you meal.  They just give you 2 small pieces of each of their 2 different kinds.  One was a "stuffed baked potato" bread and the other I don't remember.  What I do remember is that they were so frikkin good.  The butter stuff was amazing as well.  * Hot & Cold Wedge - One of the best and most interesting wedges I've ever had.  I originally thought you shouldn't mess with the standard wedge, but this one was excellent.  * Roasted Beet Salad - I don't really know what beets are or where they come from, but this salad made me a beet fan.  I've tasted about 3 beet salads in my entire life and this one was amazing.  * Filet - My wife and I split the 12oz which was more than enough.  It was cooked perfectly and was excellent.  It was flavorful and juicy and LOVE that it was cooked with butter and just the right amount of sea salt (I think).  Anyway, I love it.  Probably one of my top 5 favorite filets.  * Classic Mac N' Cheese - This was very very good but not excellent.  It was indeed classic and really nothing special.  * Honey glazed, braised and roasted carrots - HOLY COW!  Why couldn't my mother make these when I was growing up?  They were a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  I guess if you put enough sugar on anything it would be good but wow..just wow.  All the wait staff was excellent and very friendly.  The prices were a bit much but I expected it to be a rip-off so was semi-ok with it.  The place was pretty busy so there were tons of servers buzzing about and carrying plates of stuff past our table.  Everything I saw them carrying looked frikkin awesome.  I honestly can't wait to go back and try some more stuff!

The charge for dinner the other night was about $106 and we left a $20 tip in cash.  We used our Wells Fargo card for the $106.  Then today, when the charge was finalized at Wells Fargo, I see a $128 charge.  They added an additional tip to steal money!  This has to be some kind of crime.  I'm going to email the place and ask if I could come down and view the receipt to see first hand how they screw people.  * * UPDATE 4/27/10 * *  I sent an email to an address I found on the main Fox Concepts website.  I guess it was their corporate office.  Somebody got back to me within 10 minutes and said that the manager of Modern Steak would call me asap which he did.  I don't remember his name, but he told me he was sorry and thanked me for bringing this to his attention.  It turns out my waiter added another table's tip onto my tab.  The manager told me this happens all the time and was an honest mistake.  Personally I think it is BS and I caught them doing something shady, but I've never worked in a restaurant so I don't know if it was an honest mistake or not.  Anyway, the manager said he would refund the money asap.  I'll update again when the money returns to my account.   * * UPDATE 4/30/10 * *  The $22 has been returned to my bank account last night.  All is right in the world and I can rest easy!

My wife and I went here for happy hour last night.  If you stick to the happy hour menu then its a pretty good deal.  I should have listened to my own advice because after having a way-too-sweet happy hour Prickly Peartini I decided I needed a "big boy" drink and ordered a regular martini.  While the regular martini was decent, I should have stuck to the Prickly because $17 was outrageous for the size they give you.  My wife made the same mistake and ordered a $15 glass of wine instead of their "house" wine which would have been $5.  Needless to say we learned our lesson when it comes to drinks at this place.  We were a bit smarter about the food.  We shared a "Savory Nibbles" platter which is a selection of 4 very small....nibbles.  We shared the deviled egg, meatloaf slider, grilled cheese and the shrimp and manchego flat.  It was all excellent and I could have eaten an entire plate full of any one of those things.  Be warned that they are only a very small taste and only enough for one bite each if you are sharing with another person.  Anyway its not bad for $5 during happy hour.  There are 3 or so other selections that looked good as well.  3 or so of their other appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour so we ordered the Charred Chicken Lollipops.  You get a decent portion of small chicken drumstick things in some tasty sauce.  They are NOT fried and weren't drowned in sauce.  Anyway, these were excellent and I would definitely order them again.   Like most decent happy hours in the valley, this one was quite typical in terms of service.  The bar area gets a bit crowded and it takes forever to get a drink and food.  It is not really the waiters' fault because they are going almost as fast as they can.  The problem is that there aren't enough of them so they are stuck serving way to many tables.

Just went here for lunch.  I really wanted to try this place for dinner, but I was in the area (@ Steven Paul for a haircut), was hungry, and had a gift cert from Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).    There are a few paninis and pizzas on the menu for lunch.  They have about 5 or 6 paninis on the menu and they all sounded pretty good.  The chef said the grilled cheese was his fav so I had to go with that.  It wasn't the best grilled cheese I've ever had but it was pretty darn good.  The bread was amazing and the roasted red pepper stuff was a unique touch.  The chips that came with were pretty standard.  The paninis are about 8 bucks a pop so I guess that is pretty standard for the area and not totally outrageous.    I didn't like, however, that they had no salads on the menu and were out of the 'soup of the day'.  For something sweet my wife and I split the pudding.  It was sweet, chocolaty, thick and rich.  Although it was very small, it was more than enough for 2 people to take a few spoon-fulls so it was perfect.  The chef/cashier was extremely friendly and helpful.  I definitely want to come back to try their dinner creations after looking at the Yelp reviews.

I had lunch here the other day.  It was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasn't too crowded.  You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy.  So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door.    I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options.  It was pretty straight forward.  I had the standard burger, fries and a drink.  Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok.  The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.  The burger was thick, juicy and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious.  The fries were also pretty good.  They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.  I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger.  I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff.  It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries.  This place isn't exactly cheap but it is worth it.  I can't think of a better fast food burger/fries in the area.  I would return to get the burger but I really want to try their Italian beef as well.

This is going to be a weird review for me.  I'm normally not a fan of places where I don't really love the food.  We were only there for appetizers then had to move on for the evening.  Everything we had was pretty good but it is more "chick" food than anything else.  I have no doubt everything was made to order using only the highest quality local ingredients, but I found it a little too fru fru.  Same with the entrees with the exception of the pork chop.  I love the look of this place and I love how helpful and friendly the staff was especially the owner (at least I think he was the owner or something).  I also love the idea behind this place - a place that specializes in quality Arizona foods AND wines.  And the final clincher as to why I am a fan of this place (and probably most importantly) is because my wife loves it.  She wants to come back soon and try every single one of their appetizers and sample some other AZ wines.

I made my second visit to this place over the weekend and kept saying to myself, "why the f*ck am I here again?"  I guess this place appeals to certain types of people who like to overpay for "groceries" and fight for parking, but it just isn't my style.  Sure, if you live in the immediate area and find that AJ's or Whole Foods has shut down then yes, going to Oakville Grocery may fill the void temporarily.  However, if you don't live within walking distance then the place is just stupid.    On the plus side, they do have a decent selection of good looking pre-made dishes and some different wines, breads, olive oils, etc.  Their staff is also very helpful and friendly.  They also have wine and food samples from time to time.  Both times I visited I was fortunately not there to shop, but to get a sandwich from their deli thing.  Both times I ordered different things and both times I cannot remember what I had because the sandwiches were just blah.  Bland and blah.  Not a fan.

My first experience with this place was at a Yelp event a few months ago where they were giving away samples of their bruschetta and my wife and I had been wanting to pay their location a visit ever since then.  So, we went last Friday with a party of 4 for dinner and drinks.  We called in advance to make sure we got a spot on the patio.  Things got off to a rough start when the hostess couldn't find our reservation.  I always hate making reservations on the phone because this crap always happens and it pisses me off.  I much prefer making a reservation online so I have proof that I can print out.  Anyway, tt was about 7pm and the place was getting busy but they found a place for us on the patio in under 10 minutes.  We all split some bruschettas and while they were very good they weren't Postino good.  Postino has the best bruschetta by far.  For an entree I ordered the burger and it was very good.  The fries/aioli,  however, were amazing!  My only grip was with the band playing outside.  They were very good but just too loud.  It was difficult to converse with our friends.  I hate yelling and struggling to hear what is being said.  Anyway, I want to come back and try some more of their food and wines.  The place is very open, comfortable and clean.  The service is pretty good too.  As an added bonus I got a $30 gift certificate for $15 on LocalDines http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ.

When my wife and I found ourselves in downtown Chandler around lunchtime last weekend, we had to give this place a try.  My 90 year-old grandmother recommended it to us so we weren't sure what to expect.  It was a Sunday and the entire downtown area was pretty dead including this place.  This was good because I hate busy places.  The entire place has a great vibe to it which I loved.  It really does remind me of a super chill "living room".  The weather was perfect so they had all their garage-door walls opened.  We chose some comfy chairs and started with a white and a red sangria.  They were both good but you could tell they weren't homemade.  We then split some bruschetta which was excellent.  My only complaint is that the bread wasn't toasted (or not toasted enough) and was cut into 3 slices.  I don't understand why places can't cut their bruschetta into 4 pieces because 3 makes it difficult to properly share.  We then split the veggie salad and a chicken salad sandwich and they too were excellent and very tasty.  All of their salads, sandwiches and bruschettas all look excellent and I'd like to try every one.  Our waitress was extremely nice and I would return to the place anytime if it were 30 mins closer to my house.  The only other bummer was that this place is on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and I could have gotten a certificate for a couple bucks if I had known in advance I was going.

I went here last night at 7pm with a party of 7.  We were certain the place would be busy so we called ahead.  Turns out the place was pretty dead the entire 2 hours we were there.  This is why I love AZ in the summer.  I love the decor of the place.  It is real open and airy (at least when they have all the doors open), they have nice big tables and comfortable seating.  The decorations are interesting as well.  The whole place has a great vibe to it.  I just don't like it that they play the music a bit too loud.  Though I didn't have any, they have a pretty impressive and reasonably priced beer/wine/interesting cocktail menu.  They have a big list of real random cocktails that I would like to come back and sample.  The Food:  * House Potato Chips = excellent. a bit too salty though.  I have no idea why the onion dip is famous; it is pretty good but nothing that you couldn't get out of a can. * Soft Pretzels & Fondu = very good and exactly what you would expect....pretzels and melted cheese.  Nothing fancy. *Artichoke Salad = very interesting and pretty good. * Kurobuta Pork Ribs = excellent. very very tender and very very tasty.  this dish really doesn't jive with the rest of the menu but whatever...I ordered it anyway to go against the grain of my party.  The fries and cole slaw that come with are not very good. * Ricotta Gnocchi = very interesting and pretty good.  This place is very interesting to say the least thus the name I guess.  I'm not sure I would rush back but it was very good and the service was great.

Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.    Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some.

This is a long overdue review of my wife and I (well, more my wife than I....) using this hospital to deliver our son in June 2013.  The whole experience from the initial tour, to the pregnancy/newborn classes, to registration, to labor, to delivery, to checkout, was top notch.  Every one of the hospital's staff we came in contact with was professional, friendly, courteous, and experienced.  I would recommend this hospital to anyone having a baby.  I do, however, have 2 negative comments:  1 - the room service food is not very good and is ridiculously expensive.  I would give the food like 2 yelp stars.  2 - They seriously need to reconsider the accommodations given husbands (or anybody else staying with a person during labor/delivery).  I have never been more uncomfortable in my life.  The people here can save lives but can't figure out how to procure a comfortable sleeping apparatus (cot, roll-away, etc.) to put in the rooms.  It is all a blur now and all I can remember was a recliner and some other small chair that somehow turned into an awful "bed"  Normally I would take away a star because of #1 and #2 above, but since I have a happy and healthy baby and wife I won't.

Don't go to this location.  The selection isn't as good as the larger stores and the customer service is horrible.  I am a big fan of Office Max and my wife buy's all the supplies for her business from them.  However, every time we go to the store at Tempe Marketplace we are met with sales associates who go out of their way to NOT be helpful.  Go to the 917 E Broadway Road or 1110 W Elliot Road store instead.  The sales associates there will go out of their way to help you.

Service here is a complete clusterfuk.  Very disorganized.  Dropping off and picking up your car is an awful experience even if you have an appointment.  I made the mistake of not picking up my car by 5pm on a Saturday and they held it hostage until Monday morning.  Leave it to these people to make it insanely difficult to pay for and pick up your car when their department is closed.  Sure, the sales department can screw you on a Sunday, but god forbid there is somebody that can help you out in the service department 100 yards away from the sales floor.

My wife and I live right around the corner and decided it was time to stop in for one of their famous cinnamon buns.  Luckily the batch was fresh out of the oven and let me tell you the thing was phenomenal.  Moist, fluffy, warm and sweet.  I hope to return soon for another bun and to try their breakfast and lunch selections which look awesome.

I'm not sure why JJ's is so popular in other parts of the country.  It is just your average sandwich shop.  Here is my rundown:  * #14 Bootlegger Club = very good and the meat looked to be less processed than some other sandwich places. * Pickle = huge and good * Hot peppers = excellent and they totally made my sandwich. * Chips = very good.  not too oily or salty.  I ordered the sandwich "unwich" style where they wrap it in lettuce instead of using bread.  Not many places do this so I was impressed.  It was a bit difficult to eat though.  I guess the big thing is that they deliver and are open until 3am.  Not sure I'll take advantage much but it is good to know.  Anyway, they do make a pretty solid sandwich.  It was worth the 6 bucks or so.

My wife and I went here last night at about 6:30ish.  It wasn't crowded at all.  It is a great looking place and has a really cool vibe to it.  The other reviews on here cover it pretty well.  * Grilled Romain Salad - this was pretty good and was a decent size to share.  I would order it again  * Sweet & Spicy Burger - WOW!  That is all I can say.  The candied jalapenos were amazing and made for a really excellent burger.  The actual burger itself was pretty good, tasty and juicy but the toppings are what made this burger really really good.  Next time I'm going to order an extra side of candied jalapenos.  The watercress was just eh and I didn't care for it.  Anyway, this was probably the best specialty burger I've ever had.  * Roasted sweet potato fritters - these were ok.  Sorta salty and crispy outside and a warm, soft inside.  Not sure I would order them again but I'm glad I tried them.  I would have rather had sweet potato fries.  * Coal roasted vegetables - Normally when you order sides a la carte like this you get something that is at least sharable.  However, here you get a very small serving that is not shareable at all.  It was also on my wife's plate and not a separate one like the fritters were on.  It was very odd.  Anyway, the veggies (just broccoli) were very good.  Not sure why they say veggies when it is only one veggie though.  * Warm doughnuts with salted butterscotch - Another WOW from this place.  These things were soooo frikkin good.  I especially liked that they weren't huge and perfect for 2 people to share.  There were like 5 small, half dollar coin sized, doughnuts.  Crispyish outside and fluffy inside and not greasy at all.  The salted butterscotch was amazing and a perfect fit.  This place was be 5 stars if my burger came with fries and the "side" of veggies was actually a shareable side like at other places.  Oh yeah....the service was very good as well as the food.  Our waitress was very fast and friendly.

It really does amaze me how a struggling (probably) restaurant owner that took his parent's money to open this place is basically turning away repeat and future business over a measly $25.  My parents found this place on Restaurant.com and invited my wife and I to dinner here last night.  Since neither of us exactly live close to this place, it is a very reasonably assumption that none of us would have ever eaten here if it weren't for the Restaurant.com certificate.  Anyway, come the end of the meal, we present the certificate and were told that they don't accept them and that we should have presented the coupon before the meal.  I hardly ever do that because I always forget but what's the worst that can happen, right?  Well the owner spouted off some bullcrap (like we cared) about some lawsuit with Restaurant.com and that they are a scam and basically we are out of luck with the coupon.  After the owner told us that we should read directions before doing something, he offered to give us a dessert which we declined because at this point it wasn't about the 2 bucks we spent on the coupon.  It was about how this idiot wouldn't honor the face value and doesn't want repeat customer and referral business.  However, in the end, he did comp an $8 appetizer.  He also got 4 people who will never go back and hopefully many more who will read Yelp reviews and not waste their time in the first place.  All this over a measly $25 that he could have easily taken off this bill.  Anyway, if you must go here, here are some other details.  Our waitress was very fast and friendly.  When we were about to order our meals she spouted off a list of about 5 or 6 menu items that they no longer make for some reason which I thought was odd.  They do have a pretty good beer selection and some decent flights.  However, our waitress had almost no idea what beer was what when she brought them to our table.  I bet she just guessed and made it up.  Also, don't ask for a sample of the 4 peaks pumpkin porter because you will be denied because, "all they get is one keg" as told by our waitress.  The food:  * Calamari - pretty good and not overly fried.  Not not enough to share with 4 people though.  I liked the dipping sauce stuff.  Had some kick. * Wedge Salad - i thought this was excellent.  It is a pretty standard wedge but with sauteed mushrooms added.  It was a very nice touch and I would actually order it again if I were to return. * MC's Burger - this was ok.  Had too much going on I think.  Too many onions, too much sauce, bacon too tough, etc.  The fries were nothing special.  If the owner wasn't such a douche I would consider returning if I were in the area because they do have some interesting menu items that look interesting and I like beer.  However, he was a douche and there are TONS of other places out there just like it.  Perhaps I will return when this place closes and another takes its place in a few months.

I went here last night with a party of 4 at about 7:30 and it was pretty busy.  We waited about 15 mins for a table on the patio.  The inside was pretty noisy so I'm glad we got to sit outside.  The decor of the place is pretty weird/different but I guess that's what people want.  Our waitress was helpful and friendly and my diet coke refills came quickly.  Our party split the Roasted Chicken Salad without the chicken.  It was interesting and pretty good.  Not really enough to share with 4 people though.  I don't understand why this place doesn't have just regular side salads.  Both the Zinburger and the Kobe burger were top noch.  The patties were fresh, juicy and cooked perfectly.  They were decently sized as well.  Not really worth $10+, but I can deal with it because they were good.  The sweet potato fries were very good.  Not oily or mushy.  I did not enjoy the yogurt sauce stuff because it was just a weird combination.  I loved loved loved the double truffle fries though.  I could eat an entire basket of those things by myself.  I thought the zucchini fries were just 'eh.  I think they lacked flavor and should have been a bit more crunchy.  Anyway, I really liked this place.  The parking and waiting for a table  is a pain in the butt but I would like to come back soon.

This is probably one of the strangest places I have ever been and it is very difficult to describe.  My wife and I took the light rail here from Tempe to meet a few friends Friday night.  The walk from the light rail station to The Duce took about 10 minutes and it wasn't too bad.  The area looks a bit sketchy but we made it there in one piece.  The place is a huge converted warehouse.  I'll try my best to describe it.....  Bar/restaurant area - plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Great old fashion bar serving great old fashion drinks.  Gin Fizz, Rusty Nail, Old Fashion, Gimlet, etc....Sinatra stuff.  They serve each drink in a jar which is pretty unique and adds to the charm of this place.  Their food menu is pretty limited.  I sampled the bbq chicken, brisket sliders, egg sliders, chips, and corn coin things.  Everything was excellent and made fresh to order.  Nothing too fancy.  Just good ole' fashion bbq stuffs.  One minor issue though....their desserts on the menu look excellent but they didn't have any of them except for one.  Total bummer but it was ok because of the soda fountain thing inside.  Oh...and the entertainer of the evening deserves a special shout out.  It was one guy singing hits from every era while jamming on his retro keyboard/guitar combo thing.  Awesome....just awesome.    Soda Fountain - at least I think this is called a soda fountain.  Here they make old school sodas, floats and fizzes.  All excellent and bring me back to a simpler time.  A time way way way before I was born, but a simpler time nonetheless.  Inside the warehouse there is also a small movie theater thingy where they were playing some 3 Stooges episodes.  I sat on the bleachers and watched for a bit.  Other than that and a coffee bar the place is pretty much a retail space.  Old school treats, a farmers market, dry goods and clothing.  Probably a bit more random stuff than I remember but that is all that comes to mind.....those drinks were strong.  There is plenty to keep you busy there for a few hours at least.  I liked it that the place wasn't very crowded for a Friday night.  Also, everybody who worked there was very very friendly and helpful.

I went here for breakfast during a visit with my Grandma.  This place is located in your typical active senior living community clubhouse thing.  It was nice and overlooked the golf course.  It was about 11am on a Sunday and wasn't overly crowded which surprised me.  Their menu was pretty standard and had all your typical breakfast fare at very reasonable prices.  I opted for the omelet station where they had a bunch of fresh ingredients to add, fruit, pastries, carved ham and other misc. stuff.  It was all very good and my omelet turned out excellent.  The service was fast and friendly.  It really does take a very special type of person to work at a place that serves almost exclusively older folks who are very demanding and can be very difficult at times.  If I am ever in the area around breakfast time and visiting Grandma then I would definitely return.

I went here for lunch a few days ago and it was pretty good.  I sampled 3 crepes (2 savory, 1 sweet)  and they were all fresh and delicious.  I could venture a guess and bet that each one of their 15 or so crepes are excellent.  Our waitress (the owner?) was also very friendly.  The only drawback of this places is that it takes forever to get your crepe.  I understand that freshly made crepes take time, but I think they need a few more crepe maker people in the back to get them out a bit faster.

The area is pretty sketchy, but the burger was great.  There were tons of interesting menu items and I wish I could try each one, but I went with the standard cheese burger.  Of course I had to get it "Rocket" style though.  The burger plus an order of fries could have easily been a challenge on Man vs. Food.  With that said I couldn't finish the fries and burger which is a rarity for me.  For about ten bucks it was a pretty good value and well worth it.  The burger was well seasoned, cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy.  The bun held up great so I didn't make a mess of my shirt as is almost always the case when I have a burger.  I will definitely return because the Eddie Lopez burger has my name all over it!

Some friends are having their wedding at the Phoenician.  They are thinking about having one of their "wedding weekend" festivities at Relish so my wife and I joined them there for dinner to try it out.  The inside/outside of the place probably hasn't changed much since it was a simple "19th hole" bar and grill for a decade.  I think they just changed the name to something trendy and updated the menu a bit to appeal to the young/hip folk.  Anyway, the weather was perfect so we sat outside to enjoy the view.  It is just a small balcony with 5-6 tables and not much decor to speak of.  It was nice though.  I wasn't expecting it, but this place has about a zillion tequilas as you will see when you first enter the place.  So if that is your thing they definitely have something for you.  Another thing they had which I thought was quite unique was a tequila flight.  You choose a few of them and they give you a shot pour of each.  I ordered a 3 tequila flight and it came in a pretty cool tasting tray thingy which was neat.  Each one was very good and it was a great experience overall.  Tequila isn't totally my thing but I love to drink and learn about new stuff so I had to try it.  Our waitress and the manager  were like tequila sommeliers and knew about every one of their tequilas on the menu and provided great recommendations.  The food:  * Wedge Salad - this was just ok.  It was just your standard wedge.  Nothing special.  Just eh.  I love love love wedges but not this one.  I think it needed more dressing or something.  I would try another salad next time.  * Mushroom Cheese Burger - Excellent!  It was juicy and delicious.  The Kobe was perfectly tender and not overly salty as it sometimes is.  * Tater tots = Sooo good.  Enough said.  * Adult Milkshakes = Very good and very unique.  The manager guy took his time and crafted a very attractive sampler with 3 milkshakes on it for each of us.  I was especially a fan of the Reese's one but it was very very rich.  The best part about this place was the service.  Our waitress, Jasmine and the manager (looks like Ryan Phillippe but I didn't get his name) were both excellent and made our dining experience excellent.  Maybe it was because our friends are getting married there, but I like to think that they are awesome to everyone.  Anyway, I hope to return soon.

All things considered, I put this place even with Paradise Bakery as far as a solid lunch place with good sandwiches and salads.  Neither place is perfect but when I add together the positives and negatives of each; they come out even.  In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.  Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.  Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.  My wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.  I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.  I would like to go back soon and try some more sandwiches and salads and maybe some of their breakfast stuffs.

I had been wanting to try this place for months but was reluctant because I hate dealing with the crowds and parking around ASU.  However, my wife and I decided to give it a shot Saturday afternoon.  For some reason there were no crowds and parking was a breeze.  The place is nice, quaint and clean.  Not like your typical taco shop or your local Filibertos.  Well I'm not saying that Fili's isn't awesome because it is, but ATS is just a tad bit different.  We sat outside which was great because the weather was beautiful.  It really was the perfect lazy Saturday afternoon lunch.  The food:  Guacamole - this was very fresh and good.  I like it a bit more spicy but it was still very good and I would order it again.  The chips were very good as well.  Shrimp Cheviche - I thought this was just ok.  Civiche really isn't my thing but my wife loves the stuff.  Pastor Vampiro - This was excellent.  I had never heard of a vampiro before so I had to try it.  The thing was loaded with good stuff and the meat was excellent.  Taco - My wife ordered a taco (I forget which meat was in it) and it was excellent.  America's Corn - This was my favorite part of my meal.  It was sooooo good.  Needed a sprinkle of chili powder though....  Anyway, everything was very very good.  All I have to say is that it is way over priced.  Like $2.25 for a real small taco is ridiculous in my opinion but I still think the place is pretty solid.  The service was fast, friendly and courteous and I will definitely be back hopefully soon.  Oh, and I liked their selection of hot sauces on the tables.

I had a huge and growing crack in my windshield.  My insurance company had a list of 2-3 places I could use but I was free to find my own place.  I would have used the places recommended by my insurance company but I wanted a kickback you sometimes hear about for using certain local companies.  After a quick Google search I found this place (mobilephoenixautoglass.com) and it was the highest cash-back kickback I found.  So I gave them a call and set it up.  They came out as soon as they could and the technician was prompt and friendly.  The best part was that as he got out of the car he handed me the promised $100 cash.  This place was great and I would definitely use them again.

Yeah I'm pretty sure this place stole my idea.  Every time I would share my idea oh alcoholic ice cream, people would tell me it was stupid and would never work.  However, I'm glad a place has finally come along and seems to be doing just fine.  Their establishment is just as simple as their idea.  Liquor infused ice cream without all the Scottsdaley fluff.  For a couple bucks you get a quality scoop of unique ice cream and service with a smile.  I found myself early for an appointment in Old Town with some time to kill.  I felt a bit odd eating alcoholic ice cream at 2pm on a Wednesday, but I have no shame.  The day was gorgeous and perfect for a stroll with a scoop of Jack Daniels Date Nut ice cream.  I'm not sure about the alcohol content but the flavor was there and wasn't at all offensive.  Anyway, I would definitely return and can't wait to try some more of their flavors.

I went here Sunday night with a party of 4.  This was my first authentic-like tapas experience so excuse my ignorance because I really don't know much about Spanish tapas.  The ambiance of the place is great.  They must have spent tons of cash making this place look like an establishment right out of Spain.  The waiters all were dressed in all white with red sash thingys and red hats.  They looked like Spanish bull fighters to me.  Anyway, the decor is very interesting to say the least.  I had initially thought the place had just opened because some things were a complete clusterfuc like the staff was still working out opening day problems.  From getting menus, to getting bread and beverages it was a bit rough.  However, the entire staff was very friendly and the food did come out rather quickly.  In total we tried about 7 tapas.  They have tons to choose from and they looked rather authentic to my gringo eyes.  Most of the stuff I've never heard of but they pretty much all looked great.  Most are around $7 and are probably enough for a few people to sample.  Almost everything I tried was very good and the stuff that wasn't was because I had no idea what I was ordering and was trying to be adventurous.  All-in-all it was a fun experience and a perfect thing to do when having dinner with friends.  I regret not getting the sangria after reading the reviews on here but there is always next time.

Great deli.  Probably the best around.  Also one of the best reubens I've ever had.  Awesome bread (homemade I think) and tender corned beef; the stuff dreams are made of.  The only downside of this place is that the staff is overly friendly.  Like borderline annoying.  It was like being in Mexico when the locals try to usher you into a pharmacia or some other tourist trap.  I guess it doesn't matter though because I want to go back asap.  That reuben was just as addicting as whatever is in those Mexican pharmacias.

My wife and I tried this place for dinner a few nights ago.  I wasn't expecting anything great but I was pleasantly surprised.  The staff was friendly, helpful and our order was ready pretty quickly.  Everything I tried was fresh and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this place to any Mediterranean food fan.  *Greek Salad = this was really just ok and nothing special.  Big Fat Greek has them on this one.  *Pitas = these were simply excellent!  Freshly made and delicious.  *Eggplant = very unique and flavorful.  Perfect with the pitas.  *Hummus = fresh and excellent.  Also perfect with the pitas.  We also tried 4 kabobs.  Lamb, chicken, filet and ground beef.  While they were all perfectly cooked, very juicy and flavorful; we enjoyed the ground beef one the best.  While the prices aren't wildly crazy for what you get, I do think the kabobs are a buck or 2 too high if you want to order them by themselves without the rice n' stuff.  Anyway, I really really enjoyed my dinner and would come back here anytime.

The 21 Cakes team did a great job with my baby gender reveal cake.  All my wife and I knew was that we wanted blue or pink MMs to pour out of the cake when we cut it.  However, since we are the two most un-creative people on the planet, we left it to 21 Cakes to help us with the rest.  They had tons of great ideas and designed an awesome cake.  It looked great, tasted great, was reasonably priced, and was done ahead of schedule.  Most importantly, we had no idea what was going to come out of the cake until we cut it because they left no trace or clue.  I would definitely use them again for any event that requires cakes or cupcakes!  BTW....It's a boy!!!

Went here last night with a few people.  It was a Saturday night at about 7pm and surprisingly the place wasn't very crowded.  I guess it wasn't too crowded because this place looks to be a sports bar and there weren't that many sports happening on the tube.  Anyway, it was nice that it wasn't packed.  This place has a fantastic beer selection, good service and reasonable prices.  We only stayed for one beer so I didn't look at their food menu or notice any drink/happy hour specials, but my beer was excellent.  This is a great place to stop before a movie at Pollack Cinemas which is a few doors down.  I will return.

This place is pretty solid and I have no idea why it was so dead when I went.  I went with a party of 4 for happy hour ($2 off some drinks and food) on a Monday.  The place is spacious and very well decorated.  The place has a pretty cool upscale vibe to it.  We sat in the bar area and the service was very fast and friendly.  I tried 2 margaritas; the Skinny and the Silver Coin.  Both were excellent but the "skinny" one has nothing to do with the amount of calories rather that it is organic.  Go figure.  I still can't figure that one out.  The silver coin one was very good and was pretty strong.  The chips are awesome but the guac is just eh.  It seems to be fresh but is lacking any real flavor or kick.  The queso was excellent especially with the pita bread stuff (pita? really? very odd. but good).  The cheese had excellent flavor and a good amount of spice.  I would definitely get it again.  I will be back.

Wow.  Just wow.  Huge fan of this place.  The entire facility is super swanky and the staff are all friendly and helpful.  This is a perfect place to blow some money and is a great treat every once in a while.  This was our first experience at a theater like this so my wife and I went the whole 9 yards.  We got the upgraded seats, drinks and lunch.  Although the salad and flat-bread were excellent, it was too difficult to eat in the dark.  It was a stupid idea and I should have known better.  Next time I'm just going to stick to the free popcorn and have a cocktail outside in one of the attached bars (Salt or Tanzy).

My 1st. experience here was pretty good up until I looked at my online bank statement and saw that they charged me 3 times.  I was expecting a charge for the tickets and another charge for our food, but there was a random $61 charge tacked on there.  I submitted an online contact form through their website and included all the details that showed up on my Wells Fargo statement.  When I submitted the form I got an automated response that said they would get back to me within 2 business days.  Those days have come and gone and it looks like they just don't care.  Next I'm going to call the theater directly and see what happens.  I'm sure I'll get the usual run around with idiots who pretend to care but really can't do anything except transfer me to another department where I will leave a voice mail.  This cycle will most likely continue for weeks.

It has now been over a month with no call back about my issue.  I still have a $61 charge that has not been reversed.  Wells Fargo is dealing with it now and I can't wait to see them produce the receipt with a random signature on it that doesn't belong to me or my wife.  Anyway, there are some pretty shady idiots at this joint for sure.  It is a nice place but make sure they don't screw up and put somebody's tab on your card because you will NEVER be able to get in touch with them to fix the issue.

Interesting bar, good drinks, friendly staff, yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah....  However, when you are down to your last few dollars after some jackass at the blackjack table hits on an 18, go to this bar and order the drink with the flower in it.  I don't remember what it is called and it isn't on the menu but it will BLOW YOUR MIND!  Seriously, just do it.  It's the most unique $11 experience you will have, ever.

I went here for brunch on Sunday.  The place was pretty busy but our party of 4 was seated promptly.  I really really really like this place for breakfast.  Their food is excellent and unique.  All the breakfast selections I've had at their other 2 locations were all top notch and delicious.  However, I'm not really a fan of their brunch/lunch stuff.  Their bloody marys are just eh', and the food menu is just a mish mosh.  Nothing I tried was standout or memorable.  Anyway, this new location is very nice and the decor is very open and airy.  The service is very good as well.  I will definitely come back but only for breakfast.

I once was only a fan of their breakfast stuff, but now their other offerings are growing on me more and more.  I went here the other night for dinner:  The Highlights:  * Aesthetics - I just love the look of this place.  I don't know why but it really appeals to my eye. * Assorted breads and chips that come with the tzatziki and hummus platter - Hot, fresh, fluffy, and delicious.  The hummus is just ok though.  The tzatziki is pretty good. * Duck, corn and poblano crepes - The crepe was delicate and tasty.  The filling was equally as special.  The tender pieces of duck combined with corn and poblano was an excellent combination.  I would definitely get these again. * Corn and goat cheese flatbread - Very tasty and enough to share  The Lowlights:  * Smoked gouda mac and cheese - It just wasn't thick and creamy how I like it and gouda is just weird to put in mac n' cheese.  Also, rosemary doesn't belong in food.  I don't like eating potpourri.  * Roasted chicken - Eh.  It was pretty tender and juicy but just needed more flavor. * Ice cream sandwich thing for dessert - Again this was just eh.  It was like eating ice cream in a bun.

I've been here a few times and like it more and more each time I go.  The place is uber swank and great for people watching.  The bubbles, food and service aren't bad either.  I've been told this place turns into an over priced and over hyped club filled with hookers and douches at night, so I've never been (ok maybe once).  For the most part this place has only had the pleasure of my patronage during non-peak times.  My wife and I love sippin the bubbles here and there is really no other place quite like it in the area.  Just recently I found a coupon on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) for a $50 certificate for $25.  SOLD!  My wife and I went on a Friday evening for some Champagne and dinner.  The Champagne was good as always, the bruschetta was ok and the burger was excellent - especially the fries.  Overall I was very very surprised with the quality, presentation and taste of their food stuffs.  I would definitely eat there again.  The menu had several other items that looked excellent and I would try them all.  Unfortunately when places start throwing deals up on coupon sites it means they are on the outs.  I really hope that isn't the case with Narcisse because it brings a level of uniqueness and character to the Quarter.

I've been going to Dayna for over 7 years for my back and eyebrow waxing needs.  She offers excellent service at fair prices and doesn't make me cry in pain every time the wax is ripped off.  She is the only one I trust to rip hot wax off my back and I will continue to visit her a few times a year for forever.

Myself and 2 other people had dinner here Friday night.  It was about 7:30 and the place was pretty crowded but not totally packed.  I've never been here before so I made a reservation earlier in the day but I don't think we needed one.  Better safe than sorry I guess.  Everything about this place screams coolness.  From the decor to the waiters to the people there.  The place is pretty swank but not so over the top that it is a turn-off.  Anyway, it is a super cool and chill place to hang.  As for the food, here is what I tried:  * Black Truffle Hummus = I thought this was just ok.  You could definitely taste the truffle but I found the truffle/hummus combination a bit odd. * Panko Crusted Goat Cheese = Also ok but nothing special.  Basically just fried balls of goat cheese. * Grilled Wedge = This was excellent and unique. * Parc Central Burger = This was tender, juicy and delicious.  It was perfectly cooked and of a decent size.  The fries were also very good.  This place is a bit pricey but not too over the top.  Everything was quality and combined with the "coolness" factor it was worth it.  I don't know why this place needs it, but I would definitely recommend getting a Local Dines gift certificate (http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ) to save a few bucks.

I went here last night with a party of 7 for dinner.  The place was pretty dead for being around dinner time which was odd yet nice.  The weather was perfect so we sat outside.  I wouldn't mistake this place for a tavern, but I guess it is as close as you can get in the Scottsdale Quarter.  The vibe and decor of the place is pretty cool and I guess it kinda looks like an "urban" tavern.  However their beer selection is pretty weak for a tavern.  The have about 2 dozen or pretty standard brews.  The food:  * hummus = ok * mac n cheese = ok * pretzel = excellent.  I really really liked the mustard that came with as well. * grilled salmon = pretty good but also pretty standard * steak salad thing = This is more steak than salad but it was very good.  The steak strips were cooked perfectly and made a great addition to the salad.  The salad itself was very good and had a very flavorful and complementary dressing. * French Fries = excellent!!  Freshly made and perfectly cooked.  LOVE the salt.  HATED the homemade ketchup - it was like marinara sauce mixed with BBQ sauce.  No bueno.  I was expecting crappy service because of what the reviews said on here, but it was actually quite good.  The place was pretty dead so the staff would be hard pressed to NOT be attentive.  All-in-all it was a pretty good meal and dining experience.  I wouldn't rush back because it isn't really that special of a place, BUT if the other places in the Quarter are too jam-packed; I would return.

Went here last night with a party of six.  They don't take reservations for parties less than 8 so we had to wait about 20 minutes.  It was pretty busy for 8pm on a Sunday night.  The one standout thing about this place is the service.  All the workers are friendly and go out of their way to help you.  Also, the manager (I think) was just walking around and noticed that the steak of one person in my party had been undercooked (not raw, just not they way it was ordered).  The person didn't have a problem with it and didn't say anything but the manager somehow noticed out of the corner of his eye and offered to remake it then took it off the bill.  It really was outstanding service.  All the food that I had was very good.  Its not phenomenal food but is very good nonetheless.  Burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.  It's just basic bar food stepped up a notch.  I just wish I lived closer to this place so I don't know when I'll be able to make it back.  However, if I'm ever in the area again I know you really can't miss with this place with it's great atmosphere, excellent service, and solid food selections.

Jacqueline took some photos of my family a few months ago.  She was great to work with and we will use her again.  Her pictures came out great even though the shoot was a struggle because of my squirmy 2 year old son.

This place got me again.  They packed our party of 4 in like sardines and raped us of our money.  Why can't they just charge more for a ticket and not actively try to screw you over once you get in the door?  I would gladly pay more for a ticket if I were guaranteed a good seat that isn't on somebody's lap and wasn't forced to pay $5 for water.

I give this guy credit.  It takes guts to open a burger joint in a town with a bajillion other ones.  They all try to stand out from one another which is the one thing that makes them all similar to me.  Applying some type of schtick to over-priced meat is not all it takes to win my patronage.  Anyway....  My wife and I went here for dinner on Friday night.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  It was us, a few workers and 2-3 other diners.  I didn't think so by looking at the place, but it really is a neighborhood joint.  Everybody seemed to know each other and there was friendly banter between some of the diners and owner/workers.  I got a real nice friendly neighborhood vibe from the place.  The food....  * Ceasar salad - Very good - a bit too much dressing but that's the way I like it * Burger Brulee - Interesting and pretty good - I give them credit for trying something different, but it really wasn't my thing.  The burnt sugar on the bun gave it a crunchy texture but having a sweetness to a burger is weird to me. * Beach house burger - This was a good burger.  I originally wanted to order this but my wife said she was getting it so I had to order a different one.  From the bite that she gave me I could tell that it was very good.  All the ingredients seemed to work together on this one. * Sweet potato tots - These were excellent.  The only thing that would have made them better is some type of aioli. * Seasoned fries - Very good - They were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The people here are what really stand out in my mind about this place.  The owner and all the other workers were very friendly and passionate about their restaurant.  I can't wait to return to try about 17 other things on their menu that look good.

I submitted an online contact form over a week ago.  A guy named Ed called me back promptly and left me a voicemail telling me to call him back and give him some details about my nasty dirty grill.  I called back and left the details on their voicemail and have yet to hear back from them.  It has been over a week.  I guess my grill isn't fancy enough to be worth a call back saying I probably couldn't afford their services :-(

When my dog became ill, I of course wanted the best care possible for him.  Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital came highly recommended by Yelp and some close friends and family.    Dr. K and his staff are excellent, the facility is clean and comfortable, and their prices are reasonable.  Dr. K really does go above and beyond to provide the best care for your animal.  Unfortunately, I had to put my pal to sleep, but Dr. K made me feel good (or as good as one can feel about such a thing) about the difficult decision.  It wasn't easy to do but he and his staff were very professional and comforting.  They even sent a sympathy card a few days later.  I don't know when I'll get a dog again, but when I do, to Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital I will go.

Joe did a great job of isolating my pool pipe leak and fixing it without digging up my entire patio.  I couldn't be more pleased with the entire process.  The work was done quickly, professionally, accurately, and at a very reasonable price.  I hope my pipes never leak again but if they did I would call Amazing Leak Detection in a heartbeat.

This chain is really something special.  I just wish there were more around.  I love that their pizzas are a healthy alternative to traditional ones.  I also love that their pizza doesn't leave me feeling sick and bloated.  I wouldn't say it is the best pizza ever but it does the trick.  The crust/cheese isn't perfect but it comes real close.  The online nutritional information is solid and I can't believe how the quality of their ingredients cuts down on the calorie/fat/carb/etc. content.  I can't wait to return but it probably won't be for a while because their locations aren't close to anything for me.  I purposely drove like 15 miles to pick up a pizza from here after hearing about it from Mark Cuban's Twitter feed.  However, it was worth the trip to get something healthy, delicious, and unique.

This place is super swank, great for people watching and the food/service are top notch.    Here are the highlights:  * bone in ribeye = awesome but a bit fatty just the way I like it.  Perfectly cooked and great flavor. * filet = melts in your mouth * shrimp coctail with atomic horse radish = how can shrimp as big as your hand be bad? * roast corn = sweet and crunchy * potatoes au gratin = potatoey cheesy goodness  Here are the lowlights:  * the wedge salad is sub-par  and not steakhouse quality at all * the bar area is too cramped and it was a mess for our waiters and servers to maneuver.  No way I'm sitting there for dinner next time.  I would however sit there and have some drinks while listening to the piano player/singer.  * no pretzel bread * yes everything is pretty pricey but its just about what other high-end steak joints are  Anyway, I can't wait to return and hope to do so ASAP!

This is my favorite sub shop in the Valley.  Excellent bread, fresh ingredients, ok price, online ordering, and fast/friendly service.  You can't go wrong with the Capastrami or Cole-turkey.  I can't wait to return.

It's good to see a small local business doing it right!  Great concept, simple menu and straight forward pricing.  Also lets not forget their great ice cream sandwiches - they aren't fancy, they aren't huge, and they aren't expensive.  Both the cookies and ice cream are of great quality and taste (even though my wife made me get the frozen yogurt instead of the ice cream).  For an even $2 ($2.19 if you use your credit card) you get a quality treat from a husband and wife team (I think) that are happy to have your business.  I shutter to think about how many ice cream sandwiches they have to sell to make the rent on that place, but I wish them luck.  The next time I am strolling down Mill I will definitely be back.

My former stylist left town so I was forced to look for an alternative so I thought this place would work just fine.  The place looks cool and they have beer so how could it be bad?  Plus my hair isn't anything special so I didn't think I could go wrong.  It was a Friday afternoon so it wasn't that busy which was nice.  The receptionist was very nice and explained the different haircut options to me.  The next available "stylist" or "barber" or whatever they call it took me almost immediately.  I'm 90% sure she was a tweaker because her hands wouldn't stop shaking.  I just wanted a simple haircut but she kept trying to sell me different shaves.  Plus I didn't want this lady to come near me with a razor so I kept declining.  She tried cleaning up my eyebrows but ended up messing them up completely.  Between taking too much hair off leaving them lopsided and the bleeding from her chafing me with that razor thing I was ready to get the heck out of there.  My neck area was equally as raw.  I didn't even let her rinse my hair because the initial wash was awful.  This worked out because another customer walked in that looked like she had money so my barber was ready for me to leave so she could move on.  I was looking forward to the beer thing but I wasn't offered one until mid-way through my cut so I declined.  This place is very unique and has a solid concept but having Great Cips cast aways as "stylists" is not helping their cause.

This place is a nice addition to the area.  The area needed a solid place with good food that is geared to the younger crowd and Grassroots hit the mark.  They have a menu full of comfort food-like selections that doesn't overwhelm you with choices.  For an appitizer my table shared the barrata which was excellent and perfect to share because of it's size.  I was also surprised at the size of the short rib entree.  You get 3 large hunks of rib that were cooked perfectly.  The BBQ sauce was just ok but the meat was plenty flavorful and tender so it really didn't need much.  The grits were also delicious and a perfect compliment to the ribs.  The 2 under cooked asparagus spears were more for decoration than to be eaten though.  I also sampled the bbq brisket which was also very good.  As with the short rib, I prefer my meat a little fattier (I know, I'm sick) so it wasn't out of this world good for me.  All-in-all Grassroots was a good experience and I would return.  Next time I'm getting the shrimp and grits for sure.

I went here last Friday night with a party of 6 at about 8:30pm.  We had a reservation so were seated right away.  It looks like this place gets pretty crowded so I would recommend reservations.  I don't want to compare this place to Bloom but I just can't help it.  I've only dined at Bloom 3 or 4 times over the years but this place just reminds me of it.  The look and the food are a bit different but the essence of the place is still there.  Not that it is a bad thing.  Its just very similar in my eyes.  *Pretzel bread they give you to start = awesome.  They don't give you the traditional pretzel roll with normal butter.  Instead, they give you 3-inch long pretzel "sticks" with 3 different types of butter.  It was great.  *Wedge salad = excellent.  It was big, bacony and blue cheesey - just the way I like it.  *Beef brisket burger.  This was easily one of my top 10 favorite burgers.  Perfectly cooked, very tender and juicy.  Just very tasty all around.  The outside had the perfect amount of crunch and the bacon/brisket added awesome flavor and texture.  The parmesan fries were amazing as well.  Salty, crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The sweet potato fries were not very good.  I thought they were soggy and the dipping sauce was blah.  Plus I don't like when random herbs are put on fries that make them taste weird.  The rest of my party wasn't equally impressed with their meals for various reasons.  The service was pretty good except it took forever to get our main courses.  The owner/manager/someone important did come by our table to ask how everything was which was very nice.

Rick was fast, friendly, and gave my car a great tinting job.  All the tints, options and specifications were mind boggling so I just nodded my head when he was explaining things so I hope I got the best tint at the best value I could have.  Anyway, when it was all said and done my car looks great inside and out.  I would return.

Real excited to have this place so close to my house.  Good food, ok prices, decent happy hour - all good things to have within walking distance.  I went here tonight (Thursday) at about 7:30 and the place was pretty crowded with only a few tables open.  My party of 3 was seated promptly.  The place has only been open for a few days and it was pretty apparent.  The kitchen staff and the wait staff weren't in synch and it took forever for the food to come out.  We also requested that the salads come out before the pizza and it all arrived at the same time.  Not a super huge deal because the place just opened and are still figuring stuff out.  * Wedge salad - this isn't your typical wedge but I thought it was very good.  It is served with ranch, gorgonzola crumbles, tomatoes and red onion.  The standard blue cheese dressing and crumbles were absent as was the bacon.  I would order this again.  *  Caprese - this also wasn't a standard Caprese of the type you find everywhere.  Here, you are served some fresh bread, whole cherry (I think) tomatoes, burrata cheese atop some pesto and balsamic vinegar.  Everything was fresh and excellent and made for a great combination of flavors.  It was, however, very difficult to eat because the tomatoes were whole and the cheese sticky.  I can't really explain it but I just wish it was all cut up for me.  -- The Pizza --  The pizzas are probably 10-12 inches and perfect to share.  The crust is excellent and probably the best part of the pizzas I tried.  * Margarita pizza - this was just ok.  The fresh mozzarella is excellent but some slices were lacking in the cheese department.  I say just cover the thing with the stuff.  * Chicken parmesan pizza - I have no idea why I ordered this.  I normally don't fall for pizzas like this but the rest of the group wanted it.  I tend to stick to the basics.  Anyway, it was also just ok.  Each piece was perfectly covered with cheese and little pieces of chicken parmesan but it was just ok.  I can't wait to return to try some of their other pizzas.  I have a thing for lots of meat on my pizza and my wife enjoys veggies so it will be interesting to see what we settle on next because they have tons of options.  All-in-all I can say that this place is a solid addition to the neighborhood and I will definitely be back.

My wife and I went here for lunch this weekend.  I got their 1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich combo.  There aren't as many sandwich options as I would have liked so I tried the chicken one.  It was ok but not memorable.  A real piece of grilled chicken (not sliced/processed stuff) and some peppers.  It was ok.  The bread was good though.  For my salad I got the wedge and it was excellent.  Crisp and creamy just the way I like it.  Also, at about 8-9 bucks per meal it is a relative bargain.  I will return.

Yes this place is growing on me.  I guess they had a rough couple days but now the place seems to be a bit faster.  I've had to go several more times because my Keurig is still on the fritz.  The people working there are always very nice and friendly.  My only gripe is that I only sometimes get a chocolate covered espresso bean atop my coffee lid.  It is a nice treat but I can't determine how they decide when you get one and when you don't . . . .

There is nothing these people can't screw up.  They are all nice enough but they just aren't on the ball.  I use them to manage my rental property and it is a constant struggle.  Its been 3 years and I still can't get them to call me before authorizing repairs.  Don't even get me started on their rental process, their rent collection process, or screening process.  Everything is a total clusterfuk with awful communication.  If you use them to manage your property just pray you get a dream tenant that never leaves.

Everything to say has already been said on here so I will just throw in my 2 cents.  My wife and I went here for lunch on Sunday afternoon.  We both had a burger and shared a regular regular fry.  First off, the fries are excellent and a regular one is enough for 4 people.  I would like to try the cajun ones in the future though just to see if they are any good.  The burger was very good as well.  I think they are a bit pricey for what you get but I'm still a fan.  I guess all those free toppings make up for the high cost of the burger a little bit.  Also, the patties are a bit thinner than I expected but were still pretty juicy and flavorful.  Our whole experience was a positive one and the cashier was very friendly and helpful.  As far as Mill Ave. is concerned, this is probably the best burger on the block because I really dislike FatBurger's burger.

Yelp really needs a zero star option.  Words cannot quite explain how awful this company is.  I would need pictures that Yelp would not approve of so my words will have to do.  Actually, I would be wasting my time because there are dozens upon dozens of reviews on here that all say the same thing.  If you want weeks of frustration, crappy service, tech support from India, etc. then please, use Centurylink.    Also, Centurylink, just know that no amount of name changes or mergers will be able to adequately hide how awful every aspect of your service is.  I vow to make it known to anybody with ears how truly horrible you are on every level.

My wife and I had dinner her last Friday.  It was our second time dining here.  I won't review each dish we ordered because all you need to know is that anything you order will be fantastic.  You cannot make a bad choice.  The place isn't huge so I would recommend making a reservation, but if you are an early bird like my wife and I, it won't be a problem getting a table.  Service is generally pretty good even though we lost our waitress a few times during our last visit.  The only other thing that pissed me off was that they charged for blue cheese olives for my martini.  They were 75 cents each which isn't a big deal.  The big deal was that they charged at all.  I have never been to a place in my entire life that charged for specialty martini olives.

Ok McAlister's, you get your 5 stars for service.  Everyone there is overly friendly and helpful.  You also get 5 stars for the amount of staff you have on hand, the speed of service, and the cleanliness of the place.  I also enjoy the ginormous drinks that are refilled for you without you having to get up.  What I don't like is the menu.  There are just too many choices.  Also, it is a mish mash of stuff that is difficult to wrap my head around.  Looks like their thing is sweet tea, baked potatoes, salads, and deli sandwiches.  The place kinda sorta looks like a sports bar so it is all a very strange combination to me.  I've been there twice so far and have thoroughly enjoyed my salad and sandwich each time.  The ingredients look to be fresh and the portions are good.

I have no idea why this place doesn't have more stars.  I also have no idea why the place wasn't busier when I went with my wife and son on a Friday night.  This location is quieter and more spacious than their Phoenix location, and has the same great food.  Ok fine, the service wasn't perfect but I guess it doesn't have to be with that sweet jalapeno burger.  Like O-M-G so good.  They also have a great Yelp check-in deal that will save you 15% on your bill which is pretty solid.  I can't wait to return.

My wife and I recently had Edward and his team landscape our backyard.  He installed lights, a new drip system, rocks, and plants.  He also repaired our existing irrigation setup.  Edward was friendly, professional, courteous, gave an excellent price, and stayed within his estimate.  I would recommend Amberstone to anyone and would definitely use them again.

My wife and I went here a few days go with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  We aren't the most adventurous foodies, but we decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a try.  After looking at their menu then thinking about the location of this place I was unsure what to expect.  You normally don't see this type fancy foodie cuisine in South Scottsdale and I was pleasantly surprised.  Almost everything I tried was very good.  The service was equally as good as our server was fast and friendly.  The prices, on the other hand, were a bit high I thought.  * Bread plate to start = very good.  The pretzel bread was awesome but so were the other few types of bread on there.  But WHY do they feel the need to charge $3 for it?  Having to pay for bread really pisses me off.  That is like paying to refill a soda. * Pork shoulder tostadas = very good * Iceberg wedge = very interesting and very good * Braised duck = tender, juicy, and very delicious. * Pretzel crusted red bird chicken = this was just ok.  It wasn't very flavorful and you really couldn't tell it was crusted with their homemade pretzel bread. * Stoney bah-loanie = very interesting but just ok - a bit too bitter for me * Moscow mule = pretty good but their homemade ginger beer made this one need to be sweeter  All-n-all this is a pretty decent place with great food.  The scene is a bit too foodie-hipsterish for me with all the farm-to-table bs, not having fountain drinks, charging for bread, etc.  However, I give this place a lot of credit for trying something new in an area that has seen nothing like it before.

This is the company my home warranty company (www.yelp.com/biz/fidelity-national-home-warranty-concord) sent to fix a clogged pipe.  Economic Plumbing said that the clog was outside the unit in a common area and was the HOA's problem.  This is a link to my review on the plumbing company that my HOA sent:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/all-star-rooter-and-plumbing-mesa#hrid:HkGIlK61W7OaQvXUCRyRyw  I'll give more stars to the first company who can be honest and fix the clog without pointing fingers.

My property manager sent this company out again to fix the clogged pipe.  It turned out that the clog WAS within the unit.  Only this time it was in a place that wasn't covered by my home warranty and that I would have to pay an additional $90 to fix it.  I'm not really mad at the $90.  What I'm pissed about is that I had to pay $116 for 2 service calls on top of it.  It would have saved me almost $60 if they hadn't been lazy the first time and fixed the friggin thing.

It has taken my wife and I far too long to try this place.  We went last Friday for happy hour / dinner, and let me tell you, this place is a welcome addition to the immediate area which is otherwise pretty depressing food-wise.  In a sea of chains this place stands out and serves up some great food and drinks.  We arrived shortly after 5pm on a Friday and the place was beginning to fill up.  The entire patio was somehow reserved so maybe they were expecting a big party or 25 people really did call ahead to get a spot.  Either way, get there early if its a nice evening and you want to sit outside or get a spot at the bar.  Anyway, we took a seat at the bar and ordered some drinks and appetizers.....  Smoky Sow Martini - Very good.  Solid pour.  I especially enjoyed the cream cheese and bacon stuffed olives  Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves = Excellent.  A highlight among the appetizers we ordered.  Pork Belly Taco = Very good but the flavor was overpowered by the egg yolk in my opinion  Eggplant Frites = Very good.  Very unique.  It almost seemed like I was stuffing something healthy in my face.  Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms = Ok.  They did have a kick though.    I hope to return soon to sample more of their apps, salads, and main dishes.

Top notch all around.  Great atmosphere, great service, great food.  The service and food is almost the same as you would find at Mastro's; just in a more casual atmosphere.  The price is almost the same though.  My only complaint is that the sides are too small.  I hope to return soon.

This is a very difficult review to write for me.  This place does have pretty good fish tacos.  Probably the best in the area.  They are big and full of fresh ingredients.  The fish isn't fried and wasn't too dry, but could use a bit more flavor (give me a squirt bottle of secret sauce, not Cholula hot sauce).  Here are my main issues:  1 - The tacos are too damn big.  It is impossible to eat them without making a complete mess.  Why not give 4 easy-to-eat tacos rather than 2 that are impossible to eat. 2 - Why 2 plates (one for each taco) with every order of tacos?  This is just odd and takes up way too much of the already limited table space. 3 - If they are going to serve huge, messy tacos; why can't they put a napkin dispenser on the table?  I had to make a half dozen trips to the dispenser across the room. 4 - Why no shrimp tacos?  They serve coconut shrimp (which were pretty good) so I know there are shrimp in the place.  I love shrimp tacos so I think they should be on the menu.  Anyway, the prices are reasonable, the staff is fast and friendly, the decor is unique,  and the place is clean.  I know I am overly critical but I really do think Coconuts is a great addition to the area and hope it sticks around.

This place served up the best Wetzel's pretzel I've ever had.  Perfectly warm, salty, buttery, crunchy, and chewy.  I've only had about 5 Wetzel's pretzels in my day and this was by far the best.  It was so good that I kinda want to take the 30 minute drive to get another one.

My wife and I have been wanting to come here since it opened a few months ago.  We were forever passing by this place and it always looks happening so it must be pretty good, right?  Absolutely!  They did a great job renovating this place from a Lone Star Steakhouse (I think).  It is modern, open, and clean.  The place really is quite comfortable and a perfect place for some beers and burgers.  Most importantly it wasn't Scottsdale-doochey.  There is pretty much always a line and that's ok.  It moves pretty fast.  They ordering and seating system is pretty strange at first but there are tons of workers there that will give you the deal.  Basically, as you move through the line, you look over the menu and order a drink at the bar if you are interested.  Then, when you get to the register, you give your food order (after looking at a giant menu on the wall with no prices which pissed me off).  After you pay you find your table table and wait for your food.  After about 10 minutes your food arrives.  I know I explained the process poorly, but to sum it up think "strange but efficient".  Anyway, the burgers and fries I tried were excellent and likely nothing there is not a solid choice.  I want to try EVERY salad, burger, and side because they all look excellent.  Next time I'll Yelp more about the actual food instead of the actual place and process.  The staff were all very very friendly and efficient.  The only problem I have with this place is the beer selection.  It was seriously lacking.  There are like 10 things on tap (mostly local) but were things you could find at just about any other place in town.  I was hoping for some more interesting selections.  I can't wait to return.

JR and his team were prompt, professional, and did quality work. The only thing I wish they had was a brochure or something that showed the different options they offered for the glass, hinges, handles, etc.  It wasn't easy for me to drop that much money on something based on 2 pictures JR had on his phone.  I know some people know exactly what they want, but this was my first time ever dealing with custom shower glass stuff so I had zero idea what I was getting into.  However, everything looks great.  I would definitely recommend them to others and use them again in the future.

Tyler called my wife and Mary sent me an email.  They were both very nice and agreed to downgrade our accounts without a fee.  It is still up in the air if there really is a downgrade fee or not though.  I hate taking to Yelp to accomplish something that should be able to be done online or with one quick phone call, but to save time and frustration it had to be done.  ----------------------  My wife just learned that this place now has different plans and the amount we pay every month isn't even an option anymore.  We pay $19.99 and now there is a $10.95 plan that is more suitable to our needs.  Not only it is almost impossible to reach the high-ranking official that is the only one capable of managing such a complex transaction, but they charge you a $40 "downgrade" fee.  Welp...this is my 3 star to 1 star downgrade fee because of how difficult and costly they make the simplest of things.

This is a long overdue review, but better late than never.  Anyway, my wife and I had a Goof Booth for our son's 1st birthday party back in May.  Jessica and Dennis were on time. professional and friendly.  I want to throw more parties so I can have them more often because photo booths are a blast.  My son doesn't care because....well...he is one.  The booth was more for me because I love love love photo booths and taking pictures in general.  I would recommend Goof Booth to anyone and would use them again.  Their price was excellent and gear was great.  Everyone at the party was able to take as many pictures as they wanted and a great time was had by all.

I went here last night with a party of 6.  We had a reservation and were seated relatively promptly.  We were seated in the patio area which wasn't bad at all because they had ample heat lamps.  Everybody was very comfortable.  Anyway, about the food:  * Skip the Romana (Caesar) salad.  It really has no taste, but the croutons are good.  * Also pass on the (Forno Fabbri) which is the bread they should just put on the table when you sit down instead of overcharging you $2 for it.  It pisses me off when restaurants do this.  * The Verdure Grigliate (grilled vegetables) were excellent.  I need to learn how to make these myself.  * We got 3 pizzas and it really doesn't matter what they were because they were all excellent.  Each one was better than the last.  The crust is sensational.  Easily made my top 5 pizzas in the Valley.  The place is gorgeous, its an older crowd so you don't get a lot of doucebags, and the service is excellent.  I can't wait to return.

I'm trying to plan a small event/meeting here, but they make it too difficult.  All I want is to rent one of their small conference rooms and reserve a VIP bay.  I'm fine paying the hourly rate for the conference room and hitting bay, but it is just stupid that I have to pay for an entire catering package for 12 people considering my group will be smaller.  Of course we will order ample food and drinks, but I don't like being gouged or being wasteful.  All that nonsense aside, I can't wait to go here.  I hear its a blast.  However, I don't like that I have to become a "member" of a place that I may not go to all the time.  I also don't like waiting in lines so it would be nice to be able to reserve a hitting bay.  They do offer that option, but it cost $50 and comes with a list of restrictions and rules like when you try to use your frequent flier miles.  This place is a great addition to the area and I bet it is a great time, but it also seems like a clusterfuk that needs an instruction book even before you start playing.

Just to be clear, this is a review of the administration at this place.  I'm sure the food, drinks, atmosphere, and golf are fantastic and fun.  Because of this, I figured that planning a small business meeting here would be a good idea.  However, I didn't know that dealing with TopGolf is filled with more red tape and needless rules than the IRS combined with the DMV.  I just spent 2 weeks trying to arrange a small meeting where I would give TopGolf over $700.  Below is what I wanted on Saturday, November 14th.  All hourly rates are on their website or were listed on the event planning PDFs they sent me.   * Conference room from 9am to 3pm @ $40/hr ($240 total) * Hitting Bay from 3pm to 5pm and 5pm to 8pm @ $35 and $45/hr, respectively ($205 total) * Food/beverage minimum of $300 that could be applied both in the conference room and hitting bay (for some reason, a food/beverage minimum is required to get the conference room)  They turned my offer down and said they were already making too many concessions in their previous proposal.  Bummer.  Anyway, everybody I talked to was very friendly and eager to help in the typical corporate fashion.  You know....pretending to give a darn, but really just wanting to move on to a person/company with deeper pockets.

There is nothing in this world that my son loves more than bounce houses, so it seemed like a great idea to rent one for his birthday party.  However, leave it to White Knight Party Rentals to almost royally screw up the party and leave a bunch of kids with nowhere to bounce......  When I placed my order, over a month in advance, I clearly stated the time I would need the rentals by.  Of course I was told that it would not be a problem.  I even volunteered for their first available delivery time of 5am to 9am.  I didn't care if I had to get my ass up at the butt crack of dawn to take delivery of my rentals because this party was THAT important to me.  The day before the party I called to confirm and yet again I was told that my order would arrive before 9am.  I was even transferred to the jackass in charge of routing the deliveries who said it wouldn't be a problem.  Of course, the day of the party, at around 8:30am is when the fun really started.  I was getting nervous so I called White Knight Party Rentals to make sure everything was on schedule.  I was told they were "on the way" and would be to me "soon".  At 9:30 I called again and was told pretty much the same thing.  This went on a few more times at which point I was told some bullshit story about how the truck had a dead battery.  Anyway, White Knight Party Rentals was over an hour late to my party.  I will never use White Knight Party Rentals again and I suggest you don't either.  The delivery people were very nice and very quick.  It is not easy to set up a bounce house with 15 kids running around.  Oh, and the White Knight Party Rentals delivery people told me they didn't have a dead battery; they simply weren't told when I needed the equipment.  To be honest though, their prices are fair and they do have quality rental gear.

Al and his crew were prompt, professional, and reasonably priced.  I will use them again next year when my palms get unwieldy.

Michael is a great trainer who knows his stuff.  He gives a great workout that gets me sweating and leaves me sore.  I swear I want to vomit after every workout because I am so out of shape, but I keep going back for more.  The Body Shop is less than a minute from where I work and on my route home so it is difficult for me to dream up an excuse to be lazy and not workout.  Michael is available at times that are perfect for me and his rates are extremely fair, so I have no complaints other than how sore I am typing this.  The gym isn't the biggest, but it doesn't matter.  His equipment is nice, the place is clean, and you get a kick-ass workout.  I'd recommend Michael to anybody that needs a trainer.

I don't agree with Chick-Fil-A's politics, but I really agree with their food. Love the chicken, love love love the fries.  I understand this isn't a 5-star fancy pants restaurant, but this place really does deserve 5 stars in the fast food realm.  The place looks fabulous (in comparison to other fast food joints), is super clean, and the workers are all happy and go out of their way to help.

This review is specifically about their food.  It isn't typical brewery/tap house fare.  All the food they offer is of higher quality, unique, fresh, and delicious.  Everything I tried during my 2 visits has been top notch.  I can't wait to return.....well my diet can, but my appetite can't.  So far I've tried:  house made chips = delicious fried pickles = amazing kids mac n cheese = eh...but my kid scarfed it down baked buffalo wings = wow french fries = very good

Great hidden gem for the kiddos.  The place was full of fun stuff and very, very clean.  I have a 3 year old son so I don't think there is a way to keep all those toys looking and working like new, but it will be fun to watch them try.  The only downfall of this place is that adults aren't allowed in the bounce house....
