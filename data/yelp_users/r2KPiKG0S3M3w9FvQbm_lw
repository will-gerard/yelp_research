Cute store tucked in by La Grande Orange and Tammi Coe. Parking is a challenge to be sure. They have tons of gorgeous paper and although what I was looking for was a little obscure and not something they had....Lydia took the time to refer me to where she thought I could get it. She had a great solution to another item I was looking for and even emailed me a link to some great ideas. Great customer service and a beautiful product. I'll come back again for any of my paper needs.

Katie is THE best! I love this VS the best of all of them. I appreciate the help of a stylist...there is nothing like trying on lingerie and needing a different size. They are so helpful and anticipate your needs.

This Avenue is in the weirdest location. This strip mall on Thunderbird is just such a strange place to put a womens clothing store. I don't really care for Avenue's clothes. I think they lack inspiration and style which is very common in plus-size women's category. Thank goodness I am now in the smallest size they carry and working hard to bust out of there all together. The day I walked in was a fluke since I had just gotten a tea at the Starbucks in their center. I needed a pair of plain boring black shorts for summer and they had a lot of summer things on sale. I found a pair at 50% off immediately. It was kind of strange because there was only one other customer in the store with me and the saleslady appeared to be there alone. Then a man came in and greeted her. It was clear that he was a boyfriend/husband?? And he just hung out.... and hung out...and hung out. She made no attempt to help anyone but just hung out with him...not folding...not hanging..not working...just hanging out. So I picked out two things and stood by the counter waiting for some help. I finally had to catch her eye across the store and she then moved and said "Let me get you a dressing room"....Uh....no...i didn't ask for a dressing room...I wanted to buy the items. She seemed put out and came up and rang me out. All in all...just strange. I won't be sad if I don't have a reason to shop there again.

This Westin has slipped. We always stay there for Furniture Market because the parking is free and very abundant. It also has the Heavenly beds which I love and a Starbucks in the lobby. Yeah! But something has changed and service has slipped. I'm not sure we will stay there again despite the fact that we are Starwood preferred members.   My room had very spotty air conditioning which was important since it was 107 degrees. So I called down to get someone to come fix it...yada yada yada...he comes...says he's fixed it. Temp doesn't change. Finally fall asleep exhausted from the day...hot and sweaty in the not-so-heavenly bed. Then the next day their solution is to move me....I don't want to move all my unpacked stuff to another floor from my colleagues one day away from leaving. She sends guy again. This time he discovers that he's left a critical part off the air co causing the air not to flow. Then it works wonderfully. Other issues...floor not swept or vaccuumed any day we were there. Trash left out in room....not "subject to interpretation" trash but things like crumpled paper and little creamer carton from the very very weak starbucks in room coffee.   Anyways....nothing was tragic...life is too short to get too worked up...but it does seem that there has been a dramatic shift since in the past it has been such a nice experience.

Our dinner there was delightful. I was pleasantly surprised since it is a chain steakhouse. I expected good steak but it was quite well rounded. We were seated almost immediately at 7pm on a Sunday night. The server was very nice and answered alot of pointed questions about the menu and content. We both have dietary restrictions so we definitely put him through his paces. He never got frustrated with us even though we shared a few things. We both got salads. Mine was the chopped salad and was delightful. Then I got the filet mignon medium rare and my friend got the lobster tail. Mine was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Sometimes simple is really best. Thank heavens the steak was way too much meat for me to eat so I didn't have to glare  piercingly at the basket of fresh warm rolls for long. Even so I'm relatively certain they turned to yucky charcoal under my gaze. We were too full to even complain about not getting to order dessert. I took the steak home for a yummy lunch the next day and all was well. Of course we got up to leave and I promptly left the steak at the table....I ran out front and by the time I got back to the table it was whisked away. But all the while they were chasing me down trying to give it too me. I thought that was a nice extra step. Even with the plethora of classic steakhouses out there...I would still go to Capital Grille again if the opportunity and desire arouse.

I've stayed here before several times and to be honest, I do like the rooms. We stayed here for our "birthday weekend" since my husband and I were born a day apart on May 11th-13th. He called in for the reservation and was NEVER told that the whole water park was to be closed at 3pm on Saturday due to an event. Well, this seems really poor customer service to me. We stay there BECAUSE we want to float on the lazy river and  spend a day using the pools and the slide etc without getting ousted at 3pm. I appreciate that a hotel sometimes books rooms etc, but this seems like a key element to not mention to booking guests. At the very least, we should have been offered a discount, but we were given a decidedly "tough shit" attitude when we balked at check in when we were notified. We probably won't go again despite the fact that we try to do a staycation twice a year at one of the pointe's properties. Just on priniciple. Doesn't seem like a good way to treat paying guests. We have lot of options in Phoenix and alot of properties have lovely water parks. Just to be fair, the property does have generic pools withing their "Wings" but take all the people that would be in the water park and cram them into a small pool area meant mostly for adults that can't tolerate screaming kids and teenagers and what you get is.....not a very pleasant experience for a weekend getaway. I am very disappointed.

First of all...this concept is brilliant. Don't deal with the ultimate drama with the bridal gowns, but specialize in EVERYTHING ELSE! This store has a gazillion different dresses to try on. Every concievable color, style, fabric, length, etc. I am not a standard size. I wear a 16 and am used to never having anything in my size, but I could literally try on 50 dresses in this store without even looking hard, as could my size 0 daughter. Amazing. I am so surprised by all the negative comments about the customer service here. I received AMAZING service from Vickie. First of all she is knowledeable, second honest, and third multitasks very well. I was in one Sunday with my two daughters looking for a MOB dress and there were at least 4 bridal groups all wanting specialized attention. How is that even possible? It isn't....so I realized that I wasn't going to get the individual attention I desired so I came back during the week. Perfect. Had her all to myself. I have also priced both their in store prices and their website. You aren't going to find a better deal.

This is the cutest salon. Besides having a fun vibe and excellent products, their stylists are top knotch as well. I've worked with both Heather and Jessica and they are very good about listening, asking the right questions, challenging me if they think something won't work, and then executing what I've asked for. It is really nice to have someone LISTEN. In addition, I've gone in and said "do whatever" and I've left happy as well. They are artistic enough to have fun and do a good job, but not force their vision down the client's throat. I'm not the easiest person to please as an artistic person myself. I hate my hair and have a constant push me/pull you with "growing it out" and "take it all off" so praise doesn't come easy. I also have a crazy schedule and can never make an appointment that I can keep, so they are constantly juggling things to fit me in and they never make me feel like a flake! Can't say enough good things!!

Wow...we really had a GREAT night at Tuck Shop. I am so close to giving 5 stars but i'm going to save that for my next visit. We (our little dinner group) went armed with an appetite and having read other YELP reviews for inspiration. We weren't terribly surprised that there was a little wait even on a Wednesday night. But we went into the Reading Room and waited until our table was ready. Just about everything about this restaurant feels good. The location in historic Coronado....very neighborhoody and the converted house coupled with the great decor...everything tells you that you are going to get a great meal. Unpretentious and just plain delicious.   If there is any personal issue it is that our waiter let us order a stupid bottle of Pellegrino and didn't talk us into the "plain" water when indeed the "plain" water was the yummiest cucumber water I've ever had. Now personally I am partial to cucumber water...feels very spa-y to me. Can't get enough of it...so it would be my preference.   Our waiter David was darling....very sweet and humored us all night...we like to all try a little of everything so we tend to share everything three ways. A manager-ish person who didn't introduce himself asked how we were doing which is always nice...makes it seem like they care...always works for me in any case but my friend thrust the bill and credit cards at him not realizing it wan't David which he took without a hesitation and did as he was told..I laughed..my friend didn't.   But to the food. We had the Cheese Curds...OMG!! Enough said...how can you go wrong with beer battered deep fried cheese?? And yet after trying these I realize that any other fried cheese products that have been passed off as such for my whole life were frauds! Pure and simple! I'd been duped. This was heaven in a little ball of high calorie-high fat goodness!  On to the chorizo stuffed dates. Simply divine. Wouldn't change a thing. I could eat nothing but an order of that alone! Well...maybe two.   Nosh Plate- Most excellent. A Great combination of flavors, textures...the onion jam which was also described as plum jam (I don't know what it was...except delicious) mixed with the lavosh and havarti...Fantastic!   There was something with roasted veggies and hummus. It was great. Absolutely nothing to change.   Then we shared an entree of fried cod or some kind of fish? Idk...i didn't get it. I don't care for white fish much...i found it bland and a bit dry. My friends raved...and loved it...so based on the rest of the night...i'm sure it was just me. So...never mind...  Dessert...shared the molten lava chocolate cake and a blueberry cobbler. The cake was good...mind you we ate every single morsel. But quite frankly...you could get the same thing in any restaurant in town...i wasn't blown away. The cobbler was a bit too doughy-bready for my taste. The bluberries felt and tasted frozen even though I know they weren't because I overheard the story about buying them at the fresh food market from a grower in California or some such whatever....in any case...didn't love it....but quite frankly every single other detail was so fantastic that i'm certain we will go again and again.

Crappy wash....happened to be the last car of the day and they were in such a hurry they didn't even wipe off the console. New ding in my door that I got a shrug and a "not our problem" excuse for. Like an idiot I dropped my cell phone somewhere from the bench to my car and even thought it was only employees left....somehow no one found the phone. Give me a break..my problem to be sure...but I appreciate integrity in the people I deal with and this is clearly not the place to get it.

I will never order a pizza to go again. You are treated like a second class citizen and I've now been waiting 33 minutes for a personal size pizza. Ridiculous

I love this shop....great environment. Almost feels like a spa. Van does an amazing job. They almost always fit you in at any time and there are always great coupons in the mail. Don't miss the spa pedicure and spring for the paraffin wax!

This is MY starbucks....I go almost every single day. These are the reasons.   1) On my way to work 2) Right next to my bank 3) They are SO friendly 4) They understand when I'm off coffee and order "black water" that I mean a coffee of the day, black.  5) The sweet girl in the drivethrough that is there almost every day I go always acts like it is her fault when I spill an entire venti hot coffee in my car. Even though I have an insurance policy on my car upholstery for a reason.....and it's not bad lids...it's that I should live in a bubble so as not to injure others!  Love My Starbucks!

I like this place. It is not your typical localm casual mexican food restaurant. Their food is super fresh, inventive and they have some healthy options. I like the salsa bar as well. In a neighborhood with few options that aren't chains, I like supporting local business.

Great flavors and they are open on Sunday despite what it says. I love the tart flavors and they had three. I love the cookie on the bottom concept. Even though I didn't indulge...it looked yum. I will definitely go back.

We wanted to try Beckett's Table since it opened and went with much excitement. I read from the reviews that experiences were vastly mixed, but hoped for the best. We were definitely disappointed. Let me say that I rarely would review a restaurant because I am not a restaurant critic and I think it is so extremely subjective. But this was such a blaaaahhhh experience that I have to speak up.   This was all service related, honestly. There were so many opportunities for our whole experience (or at least our attitude about it) to be turned around that it is almost comical.   The restaurant is lovely. It is clear that much attention went into the design. Love the open kitchen.....the restrooms were spotless and very nicely executed (I would love to know how many fingers just HAVE to touch the broken glass light feature there). We were offered to wait for inside but since it was a lovely evening and there was no wait for the patio, we chose to be seated there for our party of 3 at 7pm on a Wednesday night. This was a great choice because the decibel level inside the restaurant was deafening.   A waiter came over about 10 minutes after we were seated and asked for our drink order. Then another waiter delivered them about 5 minutes later. We never ever saw the first or second waiter again. And we waited...and we waited....and we waited. 31 minutes after we were seated, still with one member of our party having no drink in front of him a very harried waiter came over to take our order. It was clear that something had gone wrong somewhere....an on the fly firing? Someone walking off the job? Who knows...but he definitely did get dumped an additional station it was clear. That's not the issue. Things happen, but some acknowledgement that it was a very long wait should have been offered. We gave our order including a drink for our friend. Then about 10 minutes later a basket of rolls was set on the table. At this point it was close to 8 and we were starving....still no drink for our friend. So the next time the waiter ran by frazzled we stopped him and asked again. He had no idea what we were talking about, but quickly came around and the drink did show up. Food started arriving and here are our observations on the food itself:  We shared quite a few dishes because 1) we wanted to try alot and 2) we had some dietary restrictions. We didn't order ANYTHING special or different than it appeared on the menu.   Roaster Pepper/Tomato Soup:  Excellent but not exciting...you can get it all over town  Gazpacho-Shrimp Ceviche: Excellent  Iceberg Wedge with Greeen Goddess Dressing: I loved this, but my two friends did not. I thought the flavor of the dressing was amazing and it was served perfectly. They felt it didn't quite hit the mark.   Roasted Beets: AMAZING! We all loved this even though it was quite cold by the time it got to the table  Salmon on Baguette: I didn't love but my friends thought it was one of the best they had tried. It was a bit aspic-y for my taste although once i unearthed the capers I was a happy girl.   Veggie Spaetzel: My friend was SO excited about this dish but it came cold and completely tasteless. We each put a serving on our plate and no one even finished that or went back for more.   When the waiter came to clear the table he asked if  he should leave the spaetzel for us to "enjoy" and we remarked that we hadn't enjoyed it at all and he should take it away, which left a perfect opportunity for him to apologize and asked more details. Maybe even remove this $5 item from the bill? But he DIDN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WE SAID!   We ordered dessert anyways since that was our biggest reason for going in the first place. We ordered coffee which was delicious and the darling busser/helper/whatever they call it that took our coffee order came back and let us know that they were brewing a fresh pot of decaf for us and that it would be 4 1/2 minutes and lo and behold, 5 minutes later we had coffee!   Chocolate Covered Bacon Smores: OK...we were super excited about this and well...let's face it. Anything with this combination of ingredients can't be bad, but again, it didn't quite deliver. The homemade toasted marshmallows were gritty  and not gooey like we had hoped for.   Fig Pie: To die for. Simply put. Delicious and perfect in every way.   I never hold wait staff accountable in their tip for food that I don't like or don't think was well prepared, but in almost every single instance on this visit, any problems were either a direct result of their time management or lack of customer service. We are not difficult people and have a glass half full approach to life. The simplest gesture could have turned our whole experience around. I did something i haven't done in 20 years which is to tip under 20% and even that we probably shouldn't have done but I had to on some level believe that perhaps the management had more involvement of this than was seen to our eyes.

This gym is by far the favorite i've left my money at. The prices seem fair...i've seen alot of bait and switch talk...i don't know but i thought they were very straight forward. i've been there three days a week for the past six weeks and other than the fact that i injured myself(past knee issue) i've had nothing but a good experience. they never seem to be terribly busy no matter what time or what day i go there. the busiest day i've seen is monday after work but even then i was able to find a treadmill and an elliptical free. the locker rooms are certainly adequate and have any amenity that i need. they are rarely crowded although they do seem to run a tiny bit hot. i really felt that the core concepts people tried to actually match me up with a trainer that was appropriate to my expressed needs and my personality. misty is fantastic and has worked with my injury to make sure we don't do more damage but keep on moving forward. towels are always clean and available and i rarely have to wait for equipment. so...that basically means its up to me to keep going rather than pay and then quit!!

Love my pizza Naked! Let's start by saying that I'm just excited to get SOMETHING in the neighborhood that isn't the same ole' same ole' that is on every street corner in Phoenix. So I awaited Naked Pizza with anticipation.   I expected it to be busy Friday night when I pulled in. I found a parking spot right up front. I was surprised that there was no seating and it is take out/delivery only. But that's ok if it is tasty! We asked for suggestions and we were given a couple of recommendations. We ordered a 10" Superbiotic and a 10" BBQ chicken both on original crust.   There were a few people in the lobby and ordering. It was clear that they were buzzing around like bees in the back keeping up with orders and the warming oven was full to the brim with boxes of pizzza so they were clearly very busy. I waited about 7 minutes for the pizza and we were on our way. We were very happy with the in-store service.   When we got the pizza home I was even more impressed. I found the crust to be absolutely delicious. The Superbiotic was as yummy as any $19 smaller pizza in any wood-fired joint. The crust was tasy and good...Now I'm not a huge pizza eater. My favorite is a White pizza....but this I ate every single solitary morsel of. None left for the dogs or anyone else!   I was back Sunday and Wednesday.   Welcome to the neighborhood Naked Pizza!!
