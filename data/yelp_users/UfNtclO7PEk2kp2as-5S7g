I just recently visited this place and was impressed with not only their support of all things local but that they can ship gift baskets with AZ wine to other states.  The staff Jason and Ron were very helpful and kind and Ron made me an awesome Date milkshake that got me through the rest of my day.  You gotta get one of these if you go.  They have a good selection of AZ wines and will be expanding soon.

This location has a great wine and beer selection.  They also have an awesome Wine and Tapas bar.  The prices on wine and beer by the glass are totally reasonable.  The staff is friendly and always happy to talk to you about the latest and greatest on my favorite subject booze. That Whole Paycheck thing is BS.  You just need to know what to buy.  These guys have some great, affordable events as well.

This is a great place to find hard to get wines.  They have really reasonable prices as well.  Richard is the one usually running the place and is very friendly and helpful with selecting wine.  They also carry a good selection of Arizona wines.

I like the people at this family run restaurant.  It is a great venue for me to showcase my Arizona wines.  They prepare special menus for my events and are very reasonably priced.  I have not eaten here outside of my special events.

Not only is this place supporting all local ingredients but the wine list is 100% Arizona as well.  Pavle is brave but wise my friends.  I found the food to be creative and great tasting.  I had the chicken one night and it was finger licking good.  Chef Charleen has it going on, as well as the rest of the staff.  If your looking for a great night of food and wine try this place you won't be disappointed.  This place is quickly becoming a hot spot so call ahead for RSVP, the place only has 36 seats in it. Cheeers, Jim

I would agree with most people that this place is pricey but David Johnson the wine and beer guy is very knowledgeable and the staff is friendly. Ask David and he can steer you into some great values on the liquor. They also have very affordable events and carry Arizona wine now-Yeah!

The new Down Under Wines & Bistro is a vast improvement over the old place.  The staff is friendly but this place can get crowded and service can suffer as a result. I like the many unique food items they provide and they carry many of my Arizona wines and host great events for me.  If your on the East side or in Gilbert I would check it out.

My wife and I were excited to eat here as we live around the corner from this place.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the food quality.  The chips and salsa were good and the chips served hot.  You get a hot sauce and chunky mild salsa with the chips.  This was the only high point.  Everything else ordered was not fresh tasting.  My wife ordered the fish tacos which tasted like they used frozen fish sticks from trader Joes.  My dish was a combo plate of Green Corn Tamales and Spinach Enchilada.  Both of these items were lame.  The spinach tasting like it came from a frozen bag and the tamale was mushy and bland.  The rice and beans were also bland and lifeless.  Salt and pepper didn't do anything to help.  When the server asked how our food was we told her not good and we would not return.  We got no response from her except the check.  If the food does not improve here it will not last.  Too many good Mexican food restaurants to waste your time and calories here.

Sheila is a talented artist and very perfessional, I would highly recommend her for an event.  Great with kids.
