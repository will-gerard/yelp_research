Absolutely delicious food.  We had our christmas company party there and they have a back room you can reserve for some privacy.  Great service, amazing food. Will return.

Date night, friend night, this is how we should always watch movies! Very comfortable seats, the food is okay.m but there is a lot of choices. You can buy your seats online to avoid the line.

The name is great. But there was no gas. And it is a gas station. There should be gas.  We just want to go home.

Overall my experience was great, but not because of the waitresses and drinks we had but because I had fun with the people I was with.  We went there on a wednesday night, so we knew it would be dead. The music was rap/hip-hop all night (not too loud though, we could here each others fine). There is about 5 TV screens surrounding the bar, all with different channels on (news, sports...). The waitress was pleasant. I had bought a yelp deal $10 for $20. The waitress first took off $10 of the bill and I had to explain to her that I had already paid $10 to yelp and she should take off $20 (like it says on the voucher). It took her a while to get it.  Like I said, of you are with good friends, just looking for a place to grab a drink, and you already in the area, then you'll be fine. After all it's the people you are with that will make your night!

How have I not been here before? Such a fun place to hang out and grab a drink and GF pastry with your friends. Great lunch salads. And GF double chocolate muffin !  Try it, you won't regret it!  They also have a little store in the back to look around while your food is being prepared.

This place is amazing! The food is just wonderful. Whether you order one of their many burgers, a salad, or an apetizer, it never disappints me! Great zuchini fries to try ! Cool place to try a new date spot and then walk around the biltmore area.

This hair son is absultely amazing. I used to go to Tony and Guy Academy, since I usually only get a trim. But I understand why women have to pay $50 for a hair cut.  The WHOLE staff is amazing, so welcoming and considerate. It is just a treat to myself when I go there !

Hands down one of the best place for mani-pedi.  Clean, friendly, customer oriented.    Tip: bring cash for tips, you cannot add it onto your cradit card bill (+.90 cents to use a card).

The food was very good, they have a lot of choices. Good servers. The gluten free pancakes were delicious!  I would definitely go back.

This new location is fantastic! Patio is great with misters, making it possible to eat outside during the summer. The inside is very nice also. Hipster atmosphere but not too much. The food is delicious, obviously... Long list of choices for pasty! I came in with friends and they were pretty quick to accomodate for a party of 10. Will def come back! So glad we don't have to drive to Tempe anymore to go to a Cornish Pasty :)

I have to give 5 stars just for the tacos. They have the best tacos I have ever had (I have tried a lot). Every single one is good but my favorites are the chicken, braised beef and ahi tuna. Misters outside are a plus. They have valet and located in between 2 other good restaurants, postino and a pizza place (can't remember the name).

Amanda is the best, period.  She knows what she is doing and my eyebrows have never looked better.  She is affordable, knowledgeable, friendly, and a perfectionist. She has a true passion for what she does.  You will not be disappointed.  I have stopped the search of the perfect esthetician, as I have found her.
