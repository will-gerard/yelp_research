My husband and I used to go here often when we lived in Surprise. It was good food for a decent price. I havent been here in a few years but i was craving the Hot and Sour soup so we decided to pick up an order to go. This place has really gone downhill. They have skimped on the food and the quality is poor. The sop used to have nice chunk of tofu, shrimp and beef - well not anymore. All it is is fatty beef broth with barely anything inside it. We also order the Mongolian Beef and found that there was barely any beef and lots of green onions. I will not go back to this place, unfortunately they have lost our business.

Excellent food and nice staff. I always go for the carnitas plate. This place adds a spicy kick. So delicious. One of my favorite spots in Phoenix.

This was my first experience doing hot yoga. I purchased an unlimited 2 month pass on Groupon and made a commitment to go 3-4 times a week. From the very first class I was hooked. The owners/teachers, Jim and Robin, are wonderful. The classes are made for all experience levels. It is amazing how quickly you improve your self awareness, balance, flexibility and strength.  I highly recommend this yoga studio and I am sure you will love it too.
