Really ironic that they sell electronics because there POS and credit card machines are older than me and don't work. The store is very rundown and for some reason is themed like a mini golf course from the early 90's... Best of luck with that.

Very good food and an awesome place. It can be very busy but you can't blame them for that.

I went for the first time a couple days ago because of the good reviews. It was as good as they say. The owner came out to shake my hand and introduce himself when I picked up my order and that made an impression they care about what they do. Go it's a hidden gem.

I have been shopping here for a year but it was so poorly stocked tonight I left half a cart in the isle and went to winco. The shelves were bare.

If you like cars this is a place you have to see. They give free tours to anyone who comes in the door and you get to see some of the coolest cars around.

Awesome place, very helpful. I went in with my first suit and no idea what to do they explained everything and too care of it making me look great. I needed it quick and they made sure to have it on time. When I wore my suit to the wedding I got it for I was told by multiple people I was best dressed there. I attribute that to the perfect fit. I will be back for sure.

I have been going here for about a year and my worst hair cut here so far was better than my best anywhere else ever.

Amazing food, and large portions. Very friendly people and all vegetarian options are clearly marked. I will go back.

I haven't gotten my food yet but I will never come back. The staff is so rude because they want to close. I get that it's the end of the day if you don't want to be open at 8:45 then close at 8.

Wow very surprised. Super nice inside, nice staff, and very very clean. Prices seemed reasonable for the quality of food. I eat lots of pizza, like 3 times a week lots and this place was really good. I will be back for sure. If you like wood fired style pizza you will like this place, it's the best in the area by a long shot.

They got my order wrong when I brought it up the guy he took it to the back pulled the old patty off and put it on a new bun. There was still mustard on the patty I didn't want mustard. Jerk move. I have never had a restaurant pull that. I will never go back.

Very good pizza, cool concept with the frozen yogurt place in the same building. Clean restaurant and very friendly staff. It's right near my house so I will for sure be back.
