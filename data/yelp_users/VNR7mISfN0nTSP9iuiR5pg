Great sandwhiches, best in the valley...but prices are still too high!  Yet, I come back...been going here for 12 years now.

Sales folks are pushy and not helpful.  If you want to be up sold on frames they get a higher commission on, then go here.  I prefer the optical shop aspen at Scottsdale Fashion Square because of the helpful team there alone.   More so, the store has a bigger selection in fashion square.

Great job here as always, but they often mischarge me...rather, overcharge me

Came in to have glasses repaired.  Ended up with cosmetic damage on the exterior of the frames.  These are $600 frames.  Repair tech offered $10 off, but frames are still damaged.  Did not make the customer whole after ruining the cosmetics of the frame.   Will not repeat business here.  Beware of the condition of your sunglasses before you drop them off...they will surely come out in a much different condition after they are "fixed."

I am a fan of the 500 club and often visit this course as a break in scenery from my home MVCC course.  Today, however, was by far the most unpleasant experience I have had at the 500 club.  I do not often play late twilight hours, but today, I was invited by three colleagues to play your course, so I obliged.  We arrived and checked in at 6 pm.  We purchased our round, ($28) and proceeded to play, or try to play nine holes.  For the most part, the round was enjoyable, despite not having any beverage or drink service in triple-digit temperatures, but that was not a concern for us.  What concerned me and why I am writing today is because of the rude manner in which we were treated trying to rush our round with approximately 1.5 hours of sunlight remaining.  They wanted to close up shop early and did not inform us of that fact.  After a certain time, only teenagers run the golf course and do not understand long-term market share or basic customer service principles, which pay their hourly wage.  Nevertheless, we were rudely escorted off to the club house and not even allowed to drop our bags off at the bag drop area.    I've heard of some pretty bad golf experiences with post-round play, but this one takes the cake.  Absolutely unacceptable to be mistreated in this manner.  We would not have mind if we were politely asked to finished or if we would rush our play to finish by 7:30 p.m., but instead, we were forced and guided back to the club house like a bunch of kids (all four of us are successful executives working with fortune 500 companies in Arizona).  More so, this would have been acceptable had we known to return the carts by 7:30 p.m.  Why would the pro shop employees sell us a round at 6 p.m. without informing us that the carts had to be returned at 7:30 p.m.?  To communicate the time expectation with two holes remaining in the round is absurd.  That important factorial is beyond me, but not the root cause of our complaint with this customer service -- it was the manner in which we were treated after receiving this new information and forced off of the course.   Sadly, I have been playing here for quite some time, but after my experience this afternoon, I will find it hard to return when there are much better courses in Arizona who will not only provide exceptional greens, but an exceptional experience in-and-out of the pro shop.

Hands down favorite restaurant on the strip.  Been here multiple times and it keeps exceeding my taste buds and expectations each and every time.  Try the filet, a bit of a kick!

An interesting take on brazilian steakhouse.  Great eye candy if you get dinner in before it turns into a club as well ;).

If you like dim sum and want to eat within a classy atmosphere...this is it.  Pricey, but worth it for the ambience.  Good to bring friends and family.  Have only tried dim sum -- 7 days a week.

Great service all the time.  Anyone get the singing cash register?   So funny I tipped him a five for a five dollar burrito.

Very sad food quality here.  The yoshi in central Phoenix is phenomenal, but this airport location is nor worth anyone's time.

I don't mind paying for overpriced if there's some value or taste.  This place is a chain and you get chain quality.  Will not repeat.

Great studio, but I wish there was a longer package duration.  I travel significantly and finishing a 50 session package within one year was tough.  I now have to spend $25 to extend the package I already paid $500 for...I will follow-up with management and update this review...hopefully

Talk about customer service -- they emailed me and offered to extend my expired sessions for one year.  Definitely helps, since otherwise those would have gone to waste.  Awesome!

Food great, service terrible.  If you want some expensive, gourmet food, I highly recommend.  Just don't expect to be waited on with any class or friendliness.  The waiter at the end of the meal spilled the entire leftover and actually began to box up the items that spilled on the floor with his bare hand.  Wow.  Hard to believe this happens, but I would not recommend, there are better options at the Biltmore for the same price and better food quality.    *I guess there's a reason why the restaurant was empty when we were there.

This is a pretty hot spot in Scottsdale.  Wait was long even though we were in the VIP line.  Next time I'll get a table.   Club is a great mix of the Scottsdale club type and the Scottsdale graphic tee type.  Definitely a good mix here.

Food is overpriced, which is not a big deal since we were in Vegas, but the quality was ridiculous.  Poor taste, no flavor, worst asian fusion I have ever had.  Would not recommend.  More of a place to grab a light appetizer before a club, not good for a decent meal.

This place is pretty good.  Careful not to park on the streets though within the neighborhood.  I did and paid a $30 parking ticket!  Ouch.  Only beer and wine.

Never purchase from this location.  If this is your only option, they cannot guarantee delivery.  I ordered a number of items for a sympathy gift on Wednesday assuming they would be delivered on Thursday.  Come to find out, they were not delivered at all and there was no record as to why.  When I called the store they mentioned that a delivery attempt was made but was rescheduled and lost.   Wow.   Don't depend on these guys to deliver, especially if you have a time sensitive request.  The action and subsequent followup was one of the worst customer experiences I've had.    I plan to file for a complaint with Amex if they do not refund me and make this right.

When I ordered a beef sandwich, I was instead brought out a chicken sandwich.  Obviously, surprised I asked the waitress and she replied, "we'll, I hope you like the surprise!"  I can't make this up!   Haven't been back since.  Need some wait staff training.
