Make sure you pull into this place caddy corner with a hunger for some real Mexican.  For real caddy corner, although illegal, use the pedestrian ramp  on the NW corner to launch into the parking lot.  Works best for leaving, when the place is packed. This place has some of the best tortillas, frijoles, chorizo and quesedillas in town.  The other Mexican joints are trying to do what Carolina's has been doing for years....  The only con is they aren't open on Sundays and that they could call in the amigos to renovate the place a bit....

Everyone loves this spot!  It was packed on a Friday and I understand why.  A family run place with a warm home like ambiance.  Rustico Italiano...  I've tried the salsiccia pizza with a house salad and antipasto salad, shared with friends and it was perfect.  Washed everything down with a lemon cielo which is a great digestion catalyst and gives you a crisp buzz. Great Italian, and I grew up eatin italian.....

As always the food and ambiance was like home.  Can't say the same for  our server.  Dude had to be high on some good ganja...  He was all smily and extremely forgetful and slooooow.  Don't know if Tom had a bad day or is new, but he really was lacking some energy.  C'mon when your eatin good italian food you want the passion that belongs with the Italian spirit I know the owners have.  No offense to Cibo at all,  just farmer Tom. See ya next time,  ehhhh ciao

This place has hands down some of the best service around.  Thomas runs a tight ship and if you ever have any concerns or needs hit him up.  Their burgers are to die for and I'm excited to go back and try more dishes.  Kirk is also an outstanding server,  he remembered me and my girlfriend from my previous visit and always makes you feel important.  Love this place!  One of my favorite spots in town....

Ticoz is a chill spot, and like it's sister spots Fez and Switch has a well thought out menu.  Here they have healthy southwestern dishes that do not weigh you down.  I  also like the weekend drink specials as a cheap hangover medicine or a chance to repeat my debauchery.  The staff is always jolly and attentive,  but Cheandra seemed to stand out as a great bartender and server, keeping pace with my date and I's every need.  I highly recommend taking a break from the sun to visit this cool, quiet and relaxing place;  and say hi to Cheandra for me!!!

This place lives up to it's name.  I can personally vouch for the margaritas, fish tacos, tamales, beans, red rice, white rice and salsa.  Que riquisimo!  The service was so so, but who cares. This gringo was  in hacienda heaven. I can imagine this place gets down on Cinco de Mayo.  The girlfriend and I plan to hit up the sunday brunch to get our mariachi laced funk on.  I bet the plaza is a great place for the family to convene for lunch in the spring.  Hasta luego amigos!

I really liked this spot.  Me and my date stopped there today ( Sunday) for lunch.  Tried the veggie spring rolls and the thai salad with grilled beef.  Hit the spot!  The place is chill with a laxed feel.  I like the wine racks and artwork.  The outdoor patio outside looked like a romantic spot to drink some wine with a hot date. They have live music every Saturday and Sunday night,  where I imagine the place gets much busier.  I hope to catch a night out over there before moving to downtown Phoenix.

This spot has threads you can't find anywhere else in the valley.  The owners Kyle and Jeff are awesome;  they are very knowledgeable about fashion, art, music and culture, and have great taste.   Its not only a gallery of quality and tasteful clothing, but an art gallery as well.   They host many notable and prevalent artists work from around the world as well as the valley.  I highly recommend paying the place a visit.

Went to grab a late night cup of coffee at this 24-7 spot.  The coffee is great but the service was bitchy. She really thought her coffee grounds didn't stink and seemed annoyed at our arrival. The place was thrown together in a quant old bungalow style home which has character,  but ultimately lacked class in the staff,  which is what would make a difference.  Next time I'll go somewhere else because service is half of it!
