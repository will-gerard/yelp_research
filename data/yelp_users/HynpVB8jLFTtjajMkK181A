I frequented this establishment years ago, however the quality began to lapse so I moved on. I picked up a groupon a few weeks ago to give them another try.  Well even at the discount it was not worth it.  The service is still lackluster, the quality of the work leaves much to be desired.  I won't be coming back anytime soon.

Went the first time and got an ok fade...due to the proximity I went a second time.  Big mistake.  Walked in, guy working had one person in the chair and obviously his friend sitting in the waiting area. I was told it was over an hour wait, I declined to wait and he proceeded to talk s#~t in Spanish. He might note we live in the southwest and there are more than a few people that understand Spanish. I would avoid. Try the shop next to fry's at 20th st and highland
