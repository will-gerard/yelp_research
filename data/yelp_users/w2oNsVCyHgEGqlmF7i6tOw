If i could give half a star I would. Your staff had no intention of answering any questions. Your staff was rude. You obviously only care about the bottom line. Which is how much money you can scoop in a day. Well ya missed out on some of ours. .we would have stayed gotten gas and washed car while eating but the smoking and trash out side was terrible. Enough said. We bitched at the lady who sitting in front of the door on your corner entrance and she moved one table over. We have those laws in place for a reason you should ensure they are followed while supporting staff is there. Would you allow your employees to do that?

I'm a graduate of this school and I have been trying for over a week to get my transcripts...the customer service is allot to be said for. No one returns my calls. No one knows where my paper work is. They expect you to slap down your credit card number on a fax form in order to get someone when ever they feel like it to finally send the fax but you have your info vulnerable for everyone to see. I called to make sure they got my fax.. No one called me back had to call again finally got thru. Carla was what I would call unorganized to say the least. Rude is also a good word to describe her conversation with me and she acted like it put her put to talk to me. She said she never got the fax. Lie!...i asked her to look again i have the confirmation from my fax machine it went thru. She finds it on her desk so she wasn't even sure she even had it and they want me to leave my cc number on that form...no. She Says its not filled out proper. I said yes it is i just won't put my cc info out on paper for just anyone to see. She said some one would call me no one has and i call to speak to the director which you have to leave voice message for Cuz he's busy and i get transferred only to be hung up on. Who the hell runs this school? I realize it is not in your best interest to see me go somewhere else to further my massage career but maybe just maybe if your school were more responsible I would of stayed there.

Ab solution! Absolutely saved my life.  I had some health issues come up with cancer. I was too obese to have a hysterectomy. My precancerous cells were growing. No medication was working. I found Dr.Simpson through a friend of mine from work who had his surgery with him. Dr.Simpson was awesome, kind friendly ,knowledgeable about the different types of procedures he offered.  He answered all my questions. His staff was extremely proactive in my procedure even calling me at home to see how I was. I was always treated kind even when I felt like I was grumpy. They always put me in a good mood. I live alone. My support system was limited but these guys are just a phone call away. Even now 10 months out, 135lbs down from the surgery plus the 80 on my own for a total of 2I5 lbs, I'm ecstatic about my life. He gave me all the tools I needed to succeed and he still supports my goals. His staff is always ready to answer my questions and any concerns as I work my way through this nutritional maze. I like that they help you find results in everyday choices and encourage you to try new things and even old things. Everyone's experience is different and your your own competition but they keep you on track help you stay focused. You have to be proactive ultimately its you who does the work. He and his staff are just facilitators,who all become your "cheer block" as you reach your goals. You get there with their love and support. I thank him and his staff everyday for this gift. Thank you Dr. Terry! And thank you to your staff for always helping me move forward and encouraging me to do MY best.

Erich Kritemeyer, Is the worse customer service person in the business, he was horrible. Tripped over his own verb age did not know the contract. Could not explain why he did not have an answer but he sure wanted to sell me a phone. That was the answer just buy a new phone we will give you a deal. I already had an iphone and I was unable to get the device turned on and it is because of some red tape no one had any paper work on that would produce a decision. every one said it was illegal to have possession of the phone but when I produced a police report I bought the phone they shut up. I also went to a different store where they printed off a duplicate recite and they were not happy because for every answer they had I had a point they were wrong.I also had them lookk in the records and see I purchased the iphone. He then began quoting me the law I said thats not whats in the report unless you have law enforcement degree you should not quote the law. I reminded him he could not even quote the liability clause he was so sure to stand by but could not prove he was right. I asked if while I was in the store could I call the customer service line they said yeah. He cut me off from the call. I have no idea why. the manager had to come over an reconnect the call. I told Erich I felt like i was in a circle jerk and he said first of all that language is not allowed. I said what language. He said I do not like your language I am offended. I looked right at him and said is it Erich (wanting to make sure I pronounced his name correct) What are your referring to when you say language. Because I call customer service they tell me to come here I come here you tell me to call customer service to me that is a circle jerk. he said I was offending him I said this whole situation is offensive to me!  Your lack of customer service is offensive. I paid good money for a phone i cannot turn on because of a legality which is really just an ethical decision that no one wants to make because there is no clarification on the liability clause you have just surfaced. I realize that is a new thing for this company but it is well defined your employees both front and back office as they were termed to me would not and could not produce any paper work substantiating the fact I could not get a new number linked to my device. But they were all too happy to allow me to purchase a new phone. Is this how Verizon does business this seems like a close fine line to extortion to me. Are managers or store owners  like Erich the new faces of sell sell sell. Why was someone allowed to procure a line from my plan when they were not financially sound to do so. Isn't that how the housing market got in this fix. Now that the person ha had a change in heart and will no longer make payments on his line and hasn't for some time I am locked out of a device. i offered to take back over the line and resume liability of the line in question. I just wanted to use my phone. I was told over the phone by customer service on more than one occasion that it is a simple switch of the number he continues to pay on the number and a new number is put on my device. this old number is put on "blank device".  Or in Mr. Motts case the number is not being paid on and you guys can deal with that.  He was a former Verizon wireless service manager and manipulated the system. I realize he is not employed there any more and I realize you may never employ him again but why must i suffer in the after math. is that the plan sell phones to people and not allow them to use them. There was no clause saying I resend my permission. I did it with in the allowed 60 days as I was quoted on the phone. This should of been a easy reversal. once I said that, Erich said it was 30 days once I said fine the original request to resend was now 7 days ago I have been doing this all week well with in the 30 days allowed and not all the notes have made it in the system. Erich then told me 14 days. Really!???! Had a thought quick enough and I said I did it 10 days after I sent it would he then have said 9 days.... please this is just one small example of how horrible Erich knew the Verizon policy and how disengaging he was on the store site. when he wasn't trying to argue the law with me he was hiding in back wouldn't come out and talk with me. Erich had Ayham the manager do most of the talking. Ayham wanted to help wanted to work it out and  also wanted to sell a phone as a LAST resort. At one point Erich's hands were shaking should I have been worried that his lack of responsibility and convoluted explanation of policy which could not be physically produced would of turned violent. Or was was he just nervous because he was lying and I was on the verge of getting a clue about all the legal convolution being dispensed in my direction to try and get my to buy a new phone. Bottom line is an easy credit check would of shown Mr. Mott was incapable of accepting a second line when he could not afford the first.

I understand your at war with some of your channel vendors, but your customers are loosing here. I also feel held hostage because I can't arch certain channels even on the Internet.  Your basically cock blocking my T.V. choices. If I use my cell phone data with my tablet I can watch whatever I want. So what's the problem. I think it's you that's wanting more money. You greedy pigs.

I can't say enough good things about my experience at the salon. Becca does amazing hair. I got a cut, color and Brazilian blow out!  I highly recommend her to any one wanting to enhance their look or change it up. She adds the wow factor to all hair types. I feel amazing.

I would not even give this store one star but this site makes me do it. We ordered pizza at 7 pm it arrived at 748pm . The driver explained he bought our pop at Fry's because the store was out. KUDOS TO HIM!!!! HOWEVER the girl Elaina, not sure if thats her name she doesnt speak clearly... took our order 4 times. And still didnt get it right. She is a liar. And I will further elaborate but I wanted to express we are surprised the driver made it. We repeated the address 5 times and the phone number 6 times. She was short with me on the phone. We expressed the only reason we order from your store is for the cheese sauce. Which should be in the notes next to my name. THIS LIAR SAID SHE EVEN WROTE IT ON THE BOX AND BLAMED HER MISTAKE ON THE DRIVER ..... THE ONLY THING ON THE BOX IS A SMILIE FACE. AND IF I COULD INSTAGRAM THAT ON THIS SITE I WOULD TO FURTHER EMBARRASSE HER AND THE STORE. The driver did his job. She failed him by not doing her job. She exercised very poor communication skills. She spoke like we were some dam kid on the phone her only response was "I dont know; Ugh I. Just don't. Know".... I. Know how bout you place us on hold and find out! WE know it was a waste of our time but we called back to find out where the cheese sauce was and we knew after she gave us the run around the drive would have NO CLUE we're suppose to get some. So she needs fired or retrained if you think she is worth the investment. It is now 909pm and still no cheese sauce. Thats awful!

I like this store. But I'm not happy with my product.  Customer service basically had their hands tied. .14 days clearly not enough time to evaluate a product. Thanks for your effort but I'm very unhappy. This phone is not even a month old, and malfunctions. I get locked out of my bank account.  I can't take a square customer. I click on my emails they won't open. Texting is a chore. They could of bent the rules. I feel like someone there could of made an exception. Verizon needs a better policy and a better relationship with its vendors.  You don't have to be like Walmart but you could be better than you are. This is clearly a manufacturing problem. I didn't buy my phone from Samsung I bought it from you. You should stand by it for longer than 14 days. Offering me a cap shoot refurbished phone is just plain wrong. I bought a brand new one I should get a brand new one. The former Samsung melted the back of the phone was scorching inside the Mophie case. I don't know if that was the Mophie case malfunctioning or the phone just getting too hot. But that phone should have been replaced instead I'm out about 600 bucks for this outfit. My headphones were broken within the time frame and I got them replaced barely. My G2  watch doesn't want to hold a charge and I shouldn't have to run it on black and white because I can't utilize any other color apps because its not working properly. All 3 things broke just past the 14 days all 3 things don't work properly. I don't treat my electronics poorly. That's visible.  It's just so disgusting to feel so unappreciated as a consumer. Plus I feel completely taken advantage of.

Everyone has bad days but every time I do come here I never get what I want. I have tried twice to get stuff in agave for parties, they can not accommodate.  I call to see if they have it. I go there they don't.  I'm over it.
