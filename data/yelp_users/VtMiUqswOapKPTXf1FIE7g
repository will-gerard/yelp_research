What a little gem this place is. I really loved the cozy feel of the place. Mostly outdoor seating or you can eat inside at the bar. The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly! I got the PB & B which turned out to be really good. Who would have thought peanut butter on a burger would taste good , but with the bacon and pickles it all came together very nicely . My fiancé got the  Koko which was a fried chicken a homemade biscuit with chipotle sauce and that was also delicious! I definitely will be coming back .

The beef udon suki is the best here and it's my to go dish every time I come here. I live in chandler but will drive all the way here just to eat this dish. The broth is so flavorful and every time you take a bite of the beef, udon and the soup it's amazing! The portion is big and they don't skimp on the meat which I appreciate :)

My first time here and I left never wanting to come back again. Our server was nice but it seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. Maybe she was new but non the less anytime we asked her a question about the menu or drinks she had to go ask someone else. She didn't even bring out silverware for us when she brought out our food and we were always waiting on drink refills. It took forever to get drinks and order the food. I was starving by the time we ordered and i ordered the taquitos with bean and rice. The shell of the taquitos were over fried and  when you bit into the food it tasted like stale chips. My other friends got tacos and they said the same thing about the taco shells. On top of all that the credit machine was down when we were trying to pay . She came back and asked if we had cash and when we told her we didn't, she kept saying well we can only take cash so I don't know. We asked her if she could take our card numbers down and charge it when the machine was working again but she said we couldn't. She said they were trying to fix it so we waited another hour and half and by that time I was pissed. She didn't come back to see if there was anything they could do while we waited and kinda just forgot about us. After all the waiting she comes back with the credit card number on the receipt and told us to put the phone number on the back and they will call us when they are going to charge the card. Service sucked and food sucked

Cute coffee shop right near the lake in the Sprouts Plaza. Plenty of outdoor seating and indoor seating. I love my Starbucks but this place has the best ice chai tea hands down! The times I've gone they always had great service and friendly staff.. Also you never have to wait long to get your drink. The only con is the tight parking space . When it's not busy it's fine but when it's super packed , it's a pain to park and get out.

I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food, it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that, I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!

Really good food for the price you pay. I love their Yakisoba !!!!! Also I just love the little old man who works the front. He is always so happy and really does his best to make his customers happy..  That's why I feel guilty giving this place only four stars.. But I'm giving them 4 stars because  I wish there was another person to help with taking orders and taking phone orders.. Usually it's pretty busy and the poor man is juggling everything in front so it could take awhile to order and get your food. Tip- call in your order and just pick up! So much faster :)

You can never go wrong with this place.  They have one of the best shaved ice here in Phoenix and it's one of my favorite place to get dessert. They offer tons of different flavors and I love that you can create any flavor combination. Make sure you get it bahama mama style which comes with ice cream and make sure you add creme your shaved ice. It melts in your mouth and it will satisfy any sweet cravings you have.  There usually is a wait but the staff really do try their best to get the orders out as fast as they can. I would also recommend avoiding the drive thru because the wait is twice as long. Overall I've never had a bad experience here and I love the shaved snow here. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the lines here can get long. Although it's not their fault that the lines are so long, it can be frustrating when you wait over 30 minutes .

I've been coming to this nail salon for almost two years now and I love it. They always do a good job on my manicure and pedicure. Everyone is so friendly and they remember your name. I usually come during my lunch and they always make sure I get my nails done in time to make it back to work :)

I came here for an oil change after I purchased a groupon deal. Of course the day I come in the groupon site is down and I can't retrieve the voucher. I explained the problem to him and asked how much the oil change would be? He asked me to show him my confirmation email and told me not to stress because he would still give it to me for the same price as my groupon deal. I really appreciate his customer service and how helpful he was!

It was my first time here and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the venue and the comedians that performed. It's a small hole in the wall place but I like that the Venue was intimate. My boyfriend and I sat right in the front. The Mc was entertaining and funny as well as the other comedians who performed Saturday night. The owner of the club also performed and he was fun to watch. He was also attentive to the people there and greeting people to see how they were doing. I would defiantly come back :)

I enjoy coming here when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese sandwiches. The place is big and always clean. You never have to wait long to get your food. The bread is fresh but I feel that it always cuts the roof of my mouth. So I would recommend getting the grilled pork sandwich. It's my favorite to get because the grilled pork makes the bread soft so it's not as hard to eat. I also enjoy the avocado smoothie and the egg rolls.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's cash only. I never carry cash on me so every time I want to eat here I have to go to the ATM

The boyfriend and I decided to try out Yupha's for the first time and we were not disappointed! I love the large open windows in the front as you walk in because it makes the place seem bigger.The restaurant is very clean and has a nice atmosphere. The menu selection was full of variety. We went during dinner time and we were sat right away.  Shortly after a server came by and took our drink order. I like how they give you a small pitcher for the drink you order especially since the cups are small . You would constantly be asking the server for a drink refill.  We ordered the Pra Ram-Sautéed chicken and peanut sauce over steamed spinach & Red curry in coconut milk with bamboo shoots, green peppers, string bean, egg plant and Thai basil. Both dishes were delicious! My favorite was the Pra Ram! Who knew sautéed chicken and peanut sauce over spinach could taste so good.  Overall our food was delicious, food came out fast( even though there were a lot of people) & the servers were all very friendly. We  defiantly be coming back to try more food from the menu.

I wish I could like this place better. Even though this is the closest Korean store to me I hate coming here because of the customer service. No one ever seems to be around to help and when you do ask for help they have attitude with you. First of all its your job to help people if they can't find what they're looking for and second, don't talk down to me and make me feel stupid asking for help. The lady told me where to look for the items on my list but I was having difficulty finding it. So I went back and asked her I couldn't find it. Instead of showing me where it was she just told me to look at the same place where she told me before. There was nobody in the store so I don't think it would have been that hard for her to just help me find it. As I was walking away I heard her say something to other employee about me not finding the item when it's there. By then I was already pissed off and just wanted to walk out. Maybe this place should learn about customer service is and treat the customers better. After all, if it weren't for the customers they wouldn't be in business!

I came here Friday night for a work dinner and as always the food and service was fantastic. I've  been here a few times before and everytime I come here the food is always great and the staff is friendly. I was with a large party  and the servers who helped us was really nice and very on point. They made sure our drinks were never low and made sure our party was well taken care off. I ordered the surf and turf which had a small steak, lobster tail with mashed potato. Then my co worker and I shared the cream brûlée cheesecake which was  the perfect way to end our dinner :)

My friend told me about this place and she said the food was amazing so my boyfriend and I came to try this place out. This place is only two miles from where we live so it was nice that we didn't have to drive to far to grab dinner. We were seated right away and the hostess brought our drinks out fast.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Thai Toast, Tom Kha soup, Pat Si Ew and got Sticky Mango Rice to go. Everything we ordered was delicious. I really like that they have you four types of chili sauce to accompany your food. Usually most places just give you the red chili paste but I enjoyed the variety. Although the food was delicious I'm giving them 3 star because our service was horrible! Our server was super slow , did not come up see if we needed drink refills and after we were done with our food, we waited almost 20 min before he asked us if we needed our check. We also asked for a bag to put our leftovers in and he totally forgot. We eventually had to ask the hostess for a bag instead. The restaurant wasn't that busy so I don't understand why our service sucked. I would recommend just  calling in your order and picking up the good. ( hopefully they answer the phone because we saw the server pick up the phone and just hang up when the phone kept ringing)

We love coming to Joe's Farm Grill. The food is always great and when the weather is nice we love sitting outside to eat. I like that the food tastes fresh and pretty much anything on the menu is good. My boyfriend and I love their Ahi Tuna Sandwich. It's our favorite. They give you a large size Ahi Tuna with wasabi mayo and slaw with the sandwich. So good!!!

The boyfriend and I were around San Tan village so we decided to try this place out. The restaurant reminds me of carrabas and Olive Garden put together. We started off with some calamari which were really good. It came with a marinara and spicy tarter sauce. I liked how they had some fried peppers with the calamari. Then my boyfriend ordered the lobster and shrimp fettuccini  and I got the shrimp Mediterranean. Overall great food, great service and atmosphere

I love trying out new places to eat so my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here for our anniversary. We sat in the booth area where they played live music but if you prefer more of an intimate dinner there is seating on the other side of the restaurant where it's more quiet.  We started off with the Sweet Chilli Calamari    which was different but delicious!!! I had the Sea Scallops with Parmesan Risotto and my boyfriend got the Blackened Swordfish with cornbread and jalapeño tartar. The main dishes don't come with sides so we also got a side of the Black Truffle Mac and Cheese . I personally didn't care for it. I normally love Mac and cheese but the taste was blah and it was over priced.   Overall we enjoyed our first experience at the restaurant .. I liked that it wasn't super packed and the service was good. The price of the food is a bit over priced but was expected.

I went here for my friends birthday dinner and I don't know if people hyped this place up to much but it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.   The restaurant is in a nice area and very easy to find. Its an upscale place so people were dressed up but I also saw people who were dressed very casual too. We were with a large party so we were seated in the back room the restaurant. It was obviously our first time here and nobody explained or came around to our table for a good 20 min. Finally we had to wave a waiter down to get our dinner started.  The dinner comes in two phases. First the salad bar and then the meat. They give you a two sided red/green coaster which you use to control to pace of how much meat you get. The salad bar is amazing and had a lot of variety. I recommend you take it easy your first round so you can have room for the meat. When your ready the meat carvers come around and cut the meat for you. I really enjoyed the lamb, filet mignon and the bacon wrapped chicken. I recommend you take your time eating the meat and not get everything all at once. The meat doesn't taste very good when it's cold so before trying a different meat finish the meat on your plate.  Overall the restaurant was nice, the food was good and we got free dessert because it was our friends birthday. My friends got to pick any dessert from the menu and the rest of our party got to pick either a cheesecake, chocolate moose and something else ( I can't remember lol).  They loose a star because it was our first time and nobody came around to our table to explain how everything works until we flagged someone down. It also took them a while for the meat to come around to our table.

Buffalo Wild Wings have really good wings but I was not impressed by their service. My roommates and I came Sunday evening to grab dinner and the restaurant was not busy at all. We were seated immediately but we waited about 15 min for our server to come take our drink order. There was plenty of other staff members who could have helped but instead they were all standing in the front just talking with each other.  It would have been nice if the servers helped one another and grabbed drinks for the tables. But I guess the conversation they were having was way more important then serving the customers. Our server was nice but she barely came around to our table. It took forever to get drink refills.

Cute little 50's diner inspired burger place. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. It's located in an empty plaza right off the 60 and Stapley. I'm not usually to big on burgers but my boyfriend always raves about how amazing the burgers are so I ordered the Garlic mushroom combo. The burger was juicy and I loved that the fries were hot and crispy. ( I hate when places give you soggy fries) if you're in the mood for some good burgers and fries, defiantly come check this place out!

My boyfriend discovered this place near his work. It's a small hole in the wall place but their fry bread is amazing. I love that there is a fry bread place near our house. The owners are really nice and friendly and the food comes out fast. They have this amazing jalapeño dip they give with their fry bread and it taste so good :) Last time my best friend and I went the owner have us a free powdered sugar and honey fry bread . He didn't have to do that but it was really nice of him to do that.

I love coming to Planet Subs. It's right by my work and every time I have came in for lunch I'm in and out and don't have to wait long to get my food. The sandwiches are fresh and lots of variety to choose from. On certain days they have specials and the sandwiches are cheap. On Tuesday they have turkey sandwiches for under $3 and on Thursday they have veggie sandwiches that are around $3 :)

My friends and I have been wanting to try this restaurant forever so we finally came to check it out. The restaurant was a little tricky to find. The inside of the restaurant was cozy and I really liked the cassette wall display. We made it for happy hour so all pitchers and drinks were $5. You can't beat that!  I ordered the Bahn Mi halibut sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese & my boyfriend ordered the Crab Cake BLT with a side of their Jo's Church potatoes. Both dishes were amazing and the sides were just as good. I would defiantly recommend the Jo's church potatoes. It tastes like Cracker Barrels hash town casserole but better. My friends got the Porkwich sandwich and Bacon Cheese burger. The pork on the sandwich was juicy with lots of flavor and the sandwich just melted in your mouth. Overall the food and drinks were great and the staff was friendly. Our server made sure our drinks were full every time and I liked that we didn't have to ask for refills. I would defiantly recommend this place and we will be back again.

I've been going to Spinato's Pizza for a few years now and it's one of my favorite places to come eat when I'm craving a pizza. My roommates and I always order a large pizza and the Antipasto Salad to share.  They cut the pizza into tiny slices so it's easy to eat and we always have leftovers.

My friends and I had just finished an amazing dinner at Windsor and we were full but my friend insisted that go get some ice cream next door. The inside of this shop is adorable. It reminds me of a old soda shop. The ice cream is homemade and they had all sorts of candy and other homemade goodies. I tried the Oh my Affogato which was a coke/ coffee ice cream float. My first time trying the Affogato and it was delicious!!! I'll defiantly be coming back next time I'm in the area :)

I recently went here for my friends birthday dinner. The restaurant is cute and cozy and has a nice pleasant vibe. Our server was good but I felt that he kept getting side tracked. It took him awhile to take our dinner orders and it took forever for our friend to get his beer. I ordered a sea food pasta which was one of their special for the night. I was not impressed with the food. My dish barely had an seafood on it and the dish mostly just had pasta with sauce. My favorite part of the meal was the bread they served  when we sat down.

We came here for lunch the other day because its right by my work and our school is doing an ice cream fundraiser here. So we thought we give this place a try. The owner was very friendly and helped recommend some things to eat. I ordered their Philly cheese steak with mushroom, green chili and jalapeños and my boyfriend got the cheeseburger and fries. Since it was our first time there he gave us a free drink which was nice. The food tasted really fresh and the cheese steak I got was so good. Probably one of the best cheese steaks I've tried so far in Arizona. The bread was soft and not to hard and the meat was flavorful. My boyfriend also enjoyed his cheeseburger because it wasn't greasy. The owner also came to our table before he left to check on us and to see how the food tasted. I would defiantly recommend this place and will be coming back.

If you're looking for a yummy summer treat come check out Slickables.  $2 for a Homemade cookie and Ice cream sandwich that is delicious! If you're in the area near ASU main campus it's located on Mill and 7th street.

If you're ever in the mood for sandwiches, salads and soup you must come try Zupas! I went here for lunch after my bestie suggested this place and I loved the food. I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken salad with a side of the Lobster Bisque and my boyfriend got the Club sandwich. The salad and soup was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and flavorful and I love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal

I love coming to Postinos.  The food is always good and I like the ambiance of the restaurant. We got the hummus & artichoke platter and a plate of the Bruschetta. The only thing I did not like about our visit tonight was that the hostess forgot to put us on the list and all these people who came in after us were getting seated before us. We were sitting right in front of her and she still forgot to put us on the list. when I finally asked why everyone was getting seated before us she said she thought she put us on the list. So that part was irritating and it made us almost walk out. Beside that , the food tasted delicious.

They have great flavors and I like the variety of toppings they offer. The Snoh is soft and melts in your mouth. The only thing I wish they would do with the condensed milk is layer in between the snoh. The top part is flavorful and good but midway through, it looses the flavor and doesn't taste as good.

I've had this place bookmarked on yelp for a while so I was pretty excited to finally try this place out. I met up my best friend for happy hour and drinks because we read the yelp reviews and everyone wrote how much they loved their happy hour. This place is located in and old strip mall and it's kind of tucked away. I live right by this place and I have never seen this place before till today . It doesn't  really look like much from the outside and the inside has simple decor but clean. We started off drinks and ordered some appetizers to share. We got the maple smoked pork belly, chorizo sliders, margaretta pizza and a salad. All the food we ordered were absolutely delicious and  friend and I were both pleasantly happy with our food. Come for their happy hour Monday - Saturday 4-6:30. It's a good way to sample the food for only $6 and good drinks!We will defiantly   be coming back to eat here and next time I will be trying food from the dinner menu!

I really enjoyed the food and drinks here. I made reservations 30 minutes prior to going and they were able to accommodate our group of 10. The interior was nice and clean and they let you bring your pets if you eat out in the patio area! Happy hour lasts till 7 and it's $2 off their appetizers. I ordered the Brie Hive which has shaved prosciutto, Granny Smith apples, arugula, melted Brie on honey butter sourdough with garlic aoli . The bread was a bit hard but I still enjoyed the sandwich. It tasted like a Bruchetta but sandwich style. I also got the Oh Honey Moscow mule. Although it wasn't served in a copper mug, the drink tasted good. Light and refreshing ;) Overall the servers were awesome , the service was great, food was good and the bartender made me some delicious birthday shots! Ill definitely be back to try brunch

I ordered the Satay Kway Teow which wasn't terrible but it was bland. I used the salt and pepper with some soy sauce to give it some flavor. My boyfriend got the Thai Spicy Shrimp soup and I did not like it. The flavor was confusing and it just didn't taste good. However the owner was super nice and attentive so I feel bad for leaving a bad review.. Maybe it was just what we ordered? But I was not satisfied with our dinner and it was a waste of our money.

I've had this place bookmarked on yelp to try for awhile so I was excited when to come here with my boyfriend last night. This place is located in downtown Gilbert right next to Postinos. Since it was a Friday night the wait was long but We got there just before the rush so we only had to wait 40min. The inside was very hipster and the servers were all very friendly. They brought out the chips and salsa right away. It was so good we got seconds :) I had a coupon for a free appetizer so we started off with the Ahi Tuna Ceviche. It was a nice twist using ahi tuna on the ceviche instead of the usual shrimp. I got the crispy fish,chicken Tinga and short rib tacos. My boyfriend got the carne Asada, shrimp and Baja fish. I would defiantly recommend the crispy fish and shrimp tacos!!! The tacos were the perfect size and very flavorful. The only down side is that the tacos range from 3.50 to 4.50 per taco. A bit on the pricey side for the small tacos but there so tasty ;) then they gave us free dessert because of how long we had to wait to get our table. They didn't have  to do that for us but we defiantly appreciated it. We ordered the churros and took it home to eat. The churros were nice and crispy! I defiantly would come back & recommend this place to try.

I really wanted to like this place but I didn't. The only thing I liked about this place was the name of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the fresh spring rolls, banh mi burrito and the great pho King noodle bowl. They used pulled chicken in the spring rolls and it made the rolls taste dry. The Banh mi burrito could have been good but it was bland and  would taste better over rice instead of the tortilla. The pho King noodle bowl reminded me of a vermicelli minus the fish sauce. It comes with a sweet chili sauce but they don't give enough & the noodles stuck together making it difficult to mix.  Our whole meal came out $32 which is kinda pricy for some pho and spring rolls. Btw they also charge you $2 extra for the meet when you order their entrees.   Overall I give it a 1.5 because the girl who rang us up , was nice and I liked the out door seating area especially today when the weather was perfect. However the food was bland, it was over priced and I didn't care to much for the self service.

I came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends and I really enjoyed this place. Since I had a large party , I did call in advanced and made reservations. Really great atmosphere, they have a great selection of wines, beer, cocktails and whiskey and the food was delicious! I started off by ordering a Moscow mule which was amazing. Probably one of the best I've tasted so far. For the food my fiancé ordered the Ribeye special which came with two grilled corn on the cob and potato salad. The ribeye was cooked medium rare, the potato salad was not to mushy and the potatoes had a nice taste. I was debating between  the duck meatloaf and their original chopped salad but ended up going with the salad. I felt that if their salad has its own Facebook page, the food must be worth checking out. The salad was smaller then what I expected but surprisingly very filling . The salad has corn, couscous, smoked salmon, Asiago, pepitas, tomatoes,  arugula and currants served with a buttermilk pesto dressing. I loved the vibrant colors of the salad and its definitely makes for a great photo of the dish. The servers will mix the salad right in front of you or you can choose to mix it yourself. The only thing that would make the salad better is if they added more smoked salmon.  Overall the service was amazing. Our server was very attentive and didn't rush us. She answered any questions we had and she comped my drink since it was my birthday. ( it was unexpected and I appreciate it) .The food was delicious and I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. I'll definitely be back to try some more food !   Tip: if you're coming with a large group, they can use up to four cards to split the bill.

I've been here several times and really enjoy the food and the atmosphere. They have a great selection of beer and it changes with the season. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating. When the weather is nice, dining in the outdoor seating area is perfect. I usually get their peanut butter jalapeño burger. I know peanut butter and Hamburger don't usually go together but for some odd reason it works and it's my favorite thing to get here. The meals usually come with their homemade chips but for 1.50 more you can order fries of chose from their sides menu. If you want to try the different beer they have, I suggest ordering the beer flight. You can sample 5 different beers and I love that it served on a log. If you're in the area definitely come check it out. They're pretty busy during the night and weekend so if you're going with a big party then I suggest you come early so you don't have to wait long.

I was introduced to Zumba and Z Room by a friend I go to church with and I absolutely love it! Krista is the owner and a wonderful instructor! She plays good music and time flies while your dancing and having fun. Another really good instructor is Kisha.. Very high energy and she teaches both Zumba cardio - Zumba toning!

This place is new and located in downtown chandler. It has only been open maybe 3 weeks and they have been doing a soft opening. The menu is limited to a few appetizers, salads, sandwiches and pizza. My friend and I both got salads and it was pretty good. The salad was very fresh and the dressing was tasty but light. The place is very open and it also offers a roof top patio space( nice to eat out on a sunny day). They have happy hour 2-7. I love that as soon as you walk into the place you see cages of live parrots. The birds are really pretty to look at but when your sitting close by them it's kinda annoying when it's squeaking by your ear. They have plenty of drinks to choose from but not all are available yet. The owner came around a few times to the tables to see if everyone was ourselves and that was nice. I'm giving them only four stars because they were understaffed the night we went and it took forever for the server to come and take our orders. Defiantly some room for improvement but it has great potential!

If you're craving chicken fingers and fries this is the place to go! Their chicken is tender and crispy and I love the dipping sauce that comes with the meal. The meal also comes with a side of garlic bread which is kinda odd to be served with chicken but it's so tasty that I can't complain. One thing that I would recommend is to eat at the place rather then taking it to go. The food tastes fresh and the chicken and fries are crispy .when you take it to go, the chicken and fries get soggy. Overall the food tastes great and their customer service is good!

I love Mexican food and this place has become one of my favorites. They use a mesquite grill to cook the food and it provides great flavor to the meat. They also make fresh salsa everyday and offer it at a self serve station. The owner and staff are super friendly and the food comes out fast. The food has never disappointed us whenever we came here and I  highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it.

It's nice that Phoenix now has a seafood place similar to the Boiling Crab..  It's about time! The place is big with lots of tables. I like that they have the graffiti walls that customers can draw on and leave there mark on. We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't busy and there was no wait. Our server was really nice and he explained how everything worked since it was out first visit. My boyfriend and I got a pound of the Trifecta shrimp, Lemon pepper snow crab legs and a side of Cajun fries. I liked how crispy the fries were but I wish they put more Cajun seasoning on it because I couldn't really taste the seasoning. The shrimp and crab legs were delicious. Good sized shrimp and crab legs. The seasoning is a bit different then the boiling crab. The Trifecta seasoning was a mixture of Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic sauce and I would increase the spice level. We got medium and it had a little kick but not spicy at all. I also read from reviews that the catfish was amazing and our server highly recommended it so I would like to come back and try that. Overall we enjoyed this place. The food and service was good and we'll defiantly come back again. The only thing I would like is for them to replace the napkins with paper towels and provide wet naps next time.

I love me a good Bahn Mi Sandwich and I'm glad I found a new place to satisfy my sandwich cravings. If you like Lee's sandwich you'll love this place even better. Prices are around $4 for the sandwich and you can choose to make it a combo which includes a drink & 10% discount. You can choose boba milk tea, smoothies or soda with your combo meal. I ordered the Mekong Special #1 which included ham, steamed pork, pate, pork belly and head cheese. I absolutely devoured my sandwich! The bread is made fresh and I loved that it was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  That made eating my sandwich more enjoyable because the sandwiches as Lee's always hurt the roof of my mouth because the bread was to hard. I also appreciate that they stuff the sandwich with more meat and pickled vegetables! Overall the service was good, the food came out fast and the food tastes great :) Also they accept cards which I appreciate since I never carry cash with me!

What a great park for everyone of all ages to enjoy! There is a giant playground for the kids to play on, splash pad, giant climbing equipment, open fields to play and a lake. You can bring your dog and take them on a walk of go fishing in the lake. There are also picnic  tables and grills available which is perfect for a family outing, although it would be nice if there were more shaded areas available. I brought my class here for a field trip and the kids had so much fun. They loved the large splash pad and played in cold water.  Its also gated so you don't have to worry about your kids wondering out. If you have children, this park is a great place to bring them and play & it's free :) My only complaint about the park is the bathroom. Especially since it's a public area it should be maintained and kept cleaner. Also the water fountain should be fixed , especially since it's getting hotter!

I came to Gogi when it first opened and our service was so horrible that I haven't came back until recently. I was really craving some nice cold nengmyun and my friend and I decided to come give this place a try. The restaurant was not very busy and we were seated right away. When we tried to order the nengmyun the server said they ran out. We were supper bummed and we're getting ready to leave. My friend and I were trying to find other Korean restaurants that had it but most of them are closed on a Tuesday so we really didn't have much options to pick from. Thankfully our server came back and said they just made some broth so we were able to get it. Our food came out fairly fast and the side dishes were good. My favorite was the steamed egg they brought out! Everything about our dish looked yummy! The broth was really flavorful , the noodles were soft and I liked that they gave us more then one piece of meat. I don't understand why restaurants do that for some of their dishes.  Anyways it definitely satisfied my cravings and it was the perfect way to beat the heat. This time my experience was way better then the one I had a couple of years ago and I will be back!

Saw this place on the news this morning and I had to come give it a try. Fresh made donuts with custom glazes and toppings. There are so many options to choose from and the choices are endless. If you can't decide on what to get they have a set of 15 custom donuts you can chose from . For a dozen donuts it's $15.99 and single donuts are about $2.00 each.  I would defiantly come back and create my own custom donut

This location is nice and big and located in downtown Chandler. If you're looking for something healthy to eat this is the spot to go. They offer everything from smoothies, fresh squeezed juices to salads, protein, sandwiches etc. I like their Acai bowl and the slim squeeze.  The couple times I've been here, I never had to wait to long, the staff was friendly and the food was good ! Price is not to bad but you can easily spend over  $15 for one person when ordering a drink and meal.

The restaurant is kinda hidden in the plaza on Dobson and Guadalupe. The place is small but clean. Service was good and we didn't have to wait to long for the food. We ordered some Gogi, spicy chicken, tofu soup and some Korean street tacos. Everything tasted delicious and the portions were generous. I highly recommend the Korean street tacos!

My favorite ramen place closed on mill so my friend and I decided to come here and give this place a try. The restaurant is kinda small and there is limited seating inside, but they do have an outside seating area so it's not to bad. We started off with some Matcha Teani (soju mix with matcha green tea, splash lemon juice and mint schnapps ) & Lovely DoZo (soju with sky pineapple , triple sect, red wine and sweet & sour). Both drinks tasted good but we really couldn't taste the alcohol . Then we shared a tuna poke salad which I enjoyed but the poke was thinly sliced. I didn't necessarily hate it but when I think of poke I expect bigger chunks almost cubed like pieces and the small slices of poke was ok. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork and my friend order the spicy miso with pork. Both were pretty good and the flavorful. The spicy miso could have been spicier but my tolerance for spicy food is pretty high so it wasn't spicy to me. Overall the place was clean, our server was nice and I would come back to try some of their other food.

Zinburger is one of the many new restaurant to come to downtown Gilbert area. I like that the restaurant is open with a nice outdoor patio and bar area. Very spacious and roomy. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar today and the weather was perfect. The service was fast and our server was nice. I ordered the zinburger and my boyfriend ordered the samburger and we got a side order of the truffle French fries. Both burgers tasted fresh and juicy but it's not the best I've had.  The only thing I didn't like about the burgers was that the meat was so juicy that it made the bread soggy. It was kind of messy to eat and hard to pick up. The truffle fries were crispy and good but I didn't think they were amazing like the reviews I read.

Total wine is way better then Bevmo! You could already tell the difference between Bevmo and Total wine the moment you walk in. They offer a great variety of alcohol and during the weekend ( designated time) you can sample the Alcohol.  The staff that helped us was very helpful and seemed knowledgeable about the beers we were asking about . We ended up buying a growler of the uncle bear peanut butter cup

I'm happy that there is a Filipino restaurant near where I live.  It's affordable authentic Filipino food and so far I've enjoyed all the food I've tried here. The service is always good and the owners are so friendly!. They make you feel like your apart of the family. I like that they let you sample any of the dishes if you're not sure how the food will taste.  I guarantee that no matter what you order here, you'll like the food! My favorite is the Sisig & BBQ pork :) Also I love their Halo Halo dessert. It's the best in town!

My friend had his birthday dinner here & I was excited to come try out a place I had bookmarked on Yelp. First of all parking sucks! We had to drive around numerous times before lucking out and finding parking right across the street from the Milk Bar. Our friend had made reservations so we were seated in the back room right away. He made reservations for 12 but there was enough seating for 8. I had to ask our server to bring in another table because there was no way 12 grown adults were gonna all fit. Our server was nice and brought another table right away. I liked the white interior and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar. We stared off by ordering some drinks. My fiancé got the atomic beer & I got the Copernicus . My cocktail was sweet & you couldn't really taste the  alcohol. Then we ordered the sliders, meat perogi and cheddar & jalapeño perogi. All their food is tapas style so don't expect a large meal. I really didn't care for the perogis. The meat one was soft & reminded me of a steamed dumpling while the cheddar & jalapeño one had a crunchy texture. Out of the two , I would recommend the cheddar . The sliders were probably my favorite. Two mini sliders and I liked how they used a small pail for the fries.  I don't think I would come back for the food but it's a nice place to come grab drinks! The inside area is kinda small but they also have an outside area. If you also come with a large party, remember to bring cash!!! They don't split the bill & only take two credit cards when paying for the bill.

The owners of this place are so sweet! They always have great customer service and the service is fast. You can either order boba or shaved snow. They offer a variety of snow flavors or you can build your own. They have lots of toppings and flavors of snow the chose from. I usually order the mango slush with the mango poppers and it's so refreshing & I love the burst of mango flavor from the poppers.  The have a punch card that you can get and once you have 10 stamps, your next order is free.

This place is beautiful and I love the openness of the building. I had the pleasure to work with Karlie and she was sweet and very helpful. She was very accommodating to my needs and really helped me stay in my budget for my dress. I really appreciated that! I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a wedding dress.! They have a great selection of dresses and very affordable. I'm so happy I said YES to my dress here and I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day.

If you're in the mood for some sandwiches, salads and soup Cafe Zupas is the place to go. They offer a variety of salads, sandwiches and soups and they let you sample the soups if you're not sure what tastes good. This place runs like an assembly line where one person takes your order, the next person makes the salad while another person works on the sandwich order, the next person gets your soup and then the last two people plate your orders on the tray and rings you up. One of my favorite things to order here is the strawberry salad and I always get the lobster bisque. They put the right amount of dressing in your salad so your salad using drenched with dressing. You can get a combo which are two small half orders of either a sandwich, soup or salad. Also each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry !  It can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner but the lines move fast .

When I'm craving pizza this is one of my go to spots! I love that you can build your own pizza and you can put any topping you want without paying extra :) they also have pre made pizza selections if you don't know what to get. You can choose from 3 different pizza sizes ( I usually get a mod which is equivalent to a mini medium pizza) The staff is always friendly and the service is fast!

I wanted everything in this store the moment I walked in  they have everything you need to organize and store things at your house.  Everything is pretty easy to find and the isles are big so you don't feel crowded when there are other people. The staff is friendly and greet you as you come in. The past couple times I went there were employees who went around asking if you need help with anything. The price is affordable, kinda depends on what you're buying.  Overall I liked the store and definitely be coming back to buy things for the house!

The service definitely improved and you can't beat the price for good food. Restaurant is clean and the decor is simple but nice. I've came here a few times and the food has always been good. I've tried the chicken Thai egg rolls which are light and crispy. The chicken has a hint of curry mixed in with the potatoes. The Pad See Ew is always one of my favorites and I love that it comes  with broccoli. ( some places don't serve it with broccoli and some will charge extra to add it in). The crispy garlic chicken had good flavor but it was to crispy that it was hard to eat. I didn't enjoy that dish very much. On my most recent visit I ordered the crispy Panang chicken and yummy! The chicken wasn't over cooked & it had a light batter on the chicken. The dish came out with steamed vegetables and sauce on the side. I love spicy so I asked for the Thai hot which is their highest level of spicy, but to me it wasn't hot at all.

I came here for dinner with high expectations and I'm bummed that this place was not what I was expecting. First the place is really small and it felt crowded.  I stared off with the Hirata bun which I was excited to try but it was a total fail. The bun was way to big for the amount of pork that was in it and I didn't like the piece of iceberg lettuce that was inside the bun.  Then I ordered the Spicy Ramen. It definitely looks more spicier then it tastes. For paying $10 it would have been nice if I got more then 1 piece of meat in my ramen. It was all noodles, 1 egg and 1 meat. I didn't care to much for the noodles either. I give this place 2 stars because our server was attentive and nice.

A cute little restaurant located inside the Hilton Garden Inn downtown. I really enjoyed the modern decor with the symmetrical gold light fixtures. They offered both inside and outside seating and I love how they use the wine wall to separate a part of the dining room next to the bar.  I started off with a Moscow mule and I loved loved that the drink was served in a copper mug. I know it's only a mug but when I order that drink, i expect it to be served in a copper mug. The beer choices were also really good. Then we ordered the Charcuterie plate which was amazing!!! The portion was generous and everything on the plate was so delicious. It's one of the best charcuterie plates I've tasted. I was a little bummed that it was served on a plate instead of a cheese board but it was so good that it didn't matter. Then for our main dish we ordered the baby scallops served with grill white asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, grilled potato coins, white chocolate bean cream topped with fried wonton strips. The scallops were plump and juicy and it had a nice sweet taste from the white chocolate bean sauce. Overall I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, the food was delicious and our server was great. For our 3 drinks, appetizer and main entree our bill came out to $100 which is a bit pricy but at least the food was amazing so it was money well spent!

I love everything about macarons so when this place opened up, I had to give it a try. They usually offer 3-4 different flavors of macaron that is made locally. If you're on the west side she makes macarons and ice cream Macaron that you can get a pho 43!  Then you pick any flavor ice cream you want. The staff lets you sample the different ice creams if you're not sure what to get. Then you have the option to top your ice cream with a homemade marshmallow ( courtesy of fluff it marshmallow) and they roast it right in front of you. I would definitely recommend getting the roasted marshmallow on top  makes the dessert taste better

My friends been raving about this restaurant so I tagged along with them for dinner. Everything in the restaurant is new and clean. This place is run by two brothers and their dad is the chef. Only one of the brothers were there and he was very attentive and I liked that he engaged in conversation with us. Granted my friends are regulars here and the owners know them,  Golbi introduced himself & was very friendly. I started off with the vegetable samosa which was delicious. It comes with two sauces (Tamarind & mint chutney). the green sauce reminds me of a green chili salsa and the red one is sweet & tangy. Both compliment the samosas very well. Then I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and asked for Indian Hot since I love spicy food. I ordered a side of rice with my dish or you can order a side of the garlic naan that is just as good. If you got an appetite then get both :)  Overall  the food was delicious, service was great and it's a great new addition to the Chandler area. The owner also is working on getting his alcohol license so expect to see some great beer selection coming soon!

New ice cream spot in down town Chandler so I had to try it out.  The cookies and ice cream is homemade! The ice cream sandwiches are $4.95 which is a little pricy compared to the other ones I've been too but it wasn't a big deal. I got two chocolate chip cookies with cookie butter and salted Carmel ice cream sandwich for the boyfriend and I. The cookies had good flavor but I wish the cookies were softer. It made it hard to eat it like an ice cream sandwich. However the ice cream was so delicious and on point!

Last time I came the cookie was hard and it was hard to eat the ice cream sandwich. However last night the cookies were super soft and chewy and the ice cream sandwich were on point!

A new Korean restaurant opened up and I had to come give it a try. It's located in the plaza where the new international Asian market opened. As soon as you walk i was surprised to see how spacious and open the restaurant was. I loved that the tables were not crammed right next to each other like most Korean restaurants are. I ordered the spicy pork tofu soup which was delicious & I finished the whole thing. The soup could have been spicier but i forgot to tell our waitress how spicy I wanted it; next time I'll remember to do that. ( they have 3 levels of how spicy you want the soup) The side dishes were ok.. I've had better at other Korean restaurants. I definitely will be back to try some of their other dishes :)

Finally a place where you can build your own poke bowl opens up in AZ. I love poke bowls!! It's located in the plaza on Thomas and Scottsdale Rd. You start by choosing your base of white & brown rice, salad mix or half and half. Then you choose your fish like tuna, yellowtail , salmon etc. you pick your sauce ( they offer 4 different sauces),  then you finish off your bowl with the different toppings they have.  You can either get a regular which comes with two scoops of fish or a large which comes with three scoops of fish. The staff was friendly but they seemed a little flustered and all over the place. But it's only the second day and they will get the groove of things. Also the iced green tea was disappointing because it wasn't green tea. It was jasmine tea! Overall I enjoyed the food, service was good and I will definitely be coming back!

Located in the Scottsdale shopping plaza that's right across Scottsdale mall, right next to urban outfitters. I came here on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty busy. First you start by choosing your size and base of the ice cream. You can get a single scoop, double or a nitro shake. Then you pick from their signature premium, organic, sorbet and coconut for the base. Second you pick the flavor of ice cream you want. Third you chose your topping and upgrades. I ordered a singe scoop of their signature premium, cookie butter ice cream topped with captain crunch and upgraded to have it served in a waffle bowl. The waffle bowl they used was really thin and soft. I liked that it was easy to break off and eat with the ice cream. This place is definitely a fun place to come and grab ice cream because they use the liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream right in front of you. When you see the smoke coming out of the machine , it's hard not to look in amazement and oooh and ahh as the ice cream is being made fresh. The ice cream was super creamy and rich, compared to the ice creams you get elsewhere . Overall the ice cream was good, good service, place was clean and I liked how the ice cream is made fresh right in front of you.  Ice cream is a bit pricey but and when you come with your family, the price can add up fast with all the upgrades. But there are so many combinations you can create and you come here for the experience . I'll be back to try their nitroshake next time

This place used to be the Good Egg but now it's First Watch. I really like the woodsy interior , the restaurant was clean and overall had a great atmosphere! Parking was nice since we got to park right in front & it wasn't as busy for a Saturday. I ordered the BLT Eggs Benedict which came out on a long ciabatta bread. Usually Egg Benedict comes out on two English muffins or bagels so it was the first time I've seen it served on a ciabatta bread. The bread was light and crispy, not to hard. The hollandaise was light and not as salty. The only thing I didn't care for was that it came with a side salad. The salad just did not go with my breakfast and I would have rather got a side of fresh fruit instead. You can tell by the menu that this place is geared towards healthier food options . My fiancé got the BBQ brisket hash and that was delicious! It had good flavor and the potatoes, eggs and brisket with the BBQ sauce on top all worked really well together. Overall food was great, price was not to expensive, our server was attentive. The only thing I would suggest is maybe not bringing out our bill right after we get our food. I felt kinda rushed to eat my food .
