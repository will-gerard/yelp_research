If you like Chinese Buffets, then this place is not for you.  China Chili is probably the most authentic Chinese food I've had in AZ.  Makes me feel like I'm in New York, or better yet, CHINA!  I have a theory when it comes to Chinese food - if there are lots of Asian people there, its prbably good, because for them its food.  Order the orange chicken, salty squid, eggplant in garlic sauce or the mayonaise shrimp and walnuts.  All are out of this world!  I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner, that's how much me and the family love this place!  The staff are attentive, courteous and happy to answer any questions you have.  It doesn't get much better than this!

Main reason to go to Sonora - the Kobe burger!  By far the best burger in town.  I usually go for lunch since its close to my office and have never been disappointed by the food.  Great service, great waitstaff, great food.  I've been once for dinner and the beer is exceptional.  All around a great pick! Even worth the drive from the NW Valley.

really good neighborhood place. The lunch buffet is great, especially if you are unsure what to order. You can try a few different things. The tandoori chicken and tiki Marsala are incredible!

3 Margarita's is one of my family's favorite local spots in the West Valley.  The salsa and bean dip is always fresh, the staff is always courteous and friendly and the food is always superb.  I especially like the Arroz con Pollo and the Tres Amigos (Chile Relleno, Chile Colorado and Chile Verdo).  Everything is always fresh and delicious!

So apparently everything has changed at our favorite neighborhood Mexican place.  The last 2 times we were the food was terrible!  3 Margarita's officially broke my heart and I am unwilling to get hurt again!

My husband and I went to Fuego Bistro for Valentine's Dinner.  I'm glad I made a reservation a few weeks before because otherwise there were no tables to be had.  We started with cocktails - I highly recommend the Sangria - it was wonderful!  They had an extensive wine list that we also both enjoyed.  We started with Tapas - the crab cakes and empanadas.  I am not a huge crab fan, but the crab cakes were to die for!  There was a mild pesto sauce that the crab cake sat in and a chutney for dipping.  It really pulled all the flavors out.  The empanadas were spicey and tangy enveloped in a fresh, flakey pastry that was excellent.  For entrees my husband had the steak, which he loved and I had the pork.  Although it was a bit fatty it was really flavorful.  We both had the chipotle cheddar potatoes and creamed corn which were out of this world! We ended the evening sharing the chocolate torte, which although rich was decadent and the tres leche cake which might be the best I've ever had.  Overall the evening was excellent, the service wonderful and it was a romantic evening.

This is the second time I've been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, and I wasn't disapointed!  I took my partner for dinner last night for his birthday and the food and service were outstanding.  They had the full meat menu - all 11 and roasted pineapple which is out of this world!  I was pleasantly surprised by their sangria as well as it was made with passion fruit.  Deliciosos!  Well worth the experience and expense!

I don't know about beign from Chicago or what the heck Amanda B. is talking about, but as a REAL GREEK, the gyros and tzatziki sauce are freaking great!!! Hummus - GREAT!!!  Gyros Palace doesn't sell itself as a Greek restaurant, rather quick fast food.  Love it!
