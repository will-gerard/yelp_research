great local spot. the atmosphere was cozy and relaxed. the clientele was country club. they have a great selection of different roasts and loose leaf teas.    I had a large chai tea with 2%. it was a little sweet but very tasty.   the staff was friendly and inviting. they have a fast free wifi available.   it was not a bad place to get some work done. I didn't have a lot of loud tables around me.   I will put this on my rotation of "offices" I frequent.   #supportlocal

It would have been a 4-5 star service... the location was great. I was ready to buy a monthly fast pass. I liked the facitity. the detail vacuum station was extensive and awesome.   HOWEVER... I pull u to the attendant and he tells me I am not able to go through due to the roof rack on the mini.   this was an incredible car wash boner killer.   sadly I went to their competitor.

LUNCH OUTTING.   I've been driving past this place since I moved here April 3rd and finally stopped in....   I am now kicking myself for waiting a month before I was introduced to coolest places for sandwiches.   We first walked in around 1145am and it was too crowded but we had to wait in a small line. My friend and I l we discussing to each other what we were going to order. As we wakes up the lady at the counter was already on top of our order from hearing us and wrote down a 15 and a 20 on our bags. we then proceeded to talk to my friend about the 15 and how they tried it with a new ingredient recently which enhanced the sandwich. At that point I asked the lady if this was her shop. She told me it was hers and that they would love to hear our feed back with any suggestion on sandwiches and ingredients.she always gave us her recommendation on which side was her favorite and the most popular. (the sandwich comes with a side or a bag of chips).   I ordered the turkey with avocado and bacon and a spicy Dijon sauce. My side was the garbanzo bean salad. We sat down at the table and the owner delivered our food herself. The sandwich came out pressed, toasted, and eye popping. My mouth began to salivate immediately!!    The sandwich was as delicious as it looked. crispy from the toasted bread. smokey from the bacon. creamy from the avocado. spicy from the mustard.  would I go back?  Verdict: ABSOLUTELY!   let me mention it was impressive to get such personal service from the owner of the business. she was attentive, helpful, inclusive, and genuine. you don't get service like this very often from the proprietor very often. the price was appropriate and the service was above and beyond excellent.

Tragically my iphone 6 slipped out of my back pocket, hit the tile floor perfectly and cracked my screen. The first thought i had was to search for iphone repair shops in my area. This store came up, the website is excellent, they give you what they can do and the price at what they can do it for. They even have a section where you can make an appointment online. Appointment time i found of is nice but not really necessary. They take anyone first come first serve.  To fix my phone i paid 119.12!! It only took 1 hour! This place was quite awesome. The guy at the front desk was very friendly. They had a old school Mortal Kombat arcade game that was free, and a nice big size TV to watch while you waited.  I highly recommend this store and location.

highlights:  1. the meat was really well cooked. we had pulled pork and the brisket. both were tender. moist. smokey. (not a bbq salt lick) 2. the sides were great. the beans were flavorful. the rice was soft and the coleslaw was cold and not overly dressed.  3. the staff was awesome! we went in at 8:45 (they close at 9) and received friendly service and good attitudes.  4. THIS IS FAST FOOD AND FAST SERVICE! having a good quality bbq meal fast and delicious requires a good review.   would we go back? HECK YAH! it's the only close bbq joint in town that ACTUALLY tastes like great bbq.
