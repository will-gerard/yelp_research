Ew, this place has gotten so cheesy, or has it always been? I went in there to look for a wedding shower gift and was greeted by 2 girls asking what I was there for, what a stupid question... uh underwear? So I  was so overwhelmed with all of the girls running around acting like they wanted to help you and then passing you off to another co-worker so they can help you instead. They never have any small sizes and when you ask them to check on a size or if they have it at another store they tell you to go to the register girl to look it up for you. Whatever happened to personalized service huh? Ok chick ya I know your super busy folding panties but could you help me for a sec, no, go ask another chick, ok cool thanks. And then you walk out the door and have them all say goodbye in unison.

This coffee joint is great. The coffee is so good and so strong just one small one gets your buzz on. The baked goods baked IN HOUSE are soooooo delish. My cupcake was a bit dry once, but I kind of like them like that, however my friend I was with was a bit upset about the lack of moisture. They always have great zines to read and books to look at and tons of newspapers lying around. The seating is good, however they might want to rethink all of the white couches and chairs because they are super beat up. I think this place is the bee's knee's and you should go sip some java at this joint.

By far my top 5 places I have to eat it when I visit my homeland, Scottsdale, AZ. I love it when people complain that this place is pretentious... why because it is the only place in AZ that is consistently great and has been running since 1988 (far longer than most places ever make it in the dale), because the wait staff is extremely competent and actually looks great and groomed? Because they actually care about the design of their restaurant and support artists and have an extremely interesting and topical rotating art installations several times a year? Or because they have the best drinks in the city, THE MOSCOW MULE IN THE COPPER MUG IS AMAZING!!!!, and the best chicken sandwich and waffle fires I have ever had. Then yes it is pretentious, and I LOVE IT. This place also rocks because they have been putting up with my mom and her friends for 20 years and their silly requests. Like, saying they want their food on a plate not in a basket, they need their diet cokes in the tallest pilsner glass with extra cups of ice, five sides of buffalo blue cheese sauce, and helping them with their strategic seating requests so that they can view every patron that enters and exits..... now come on, that is some service!

This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isn't done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late.

People in Phoenix should consider themselves very very lucky to have such an amazing place! The wine and beer list is so divine and thought out, the menu is by far the best food you could ever get at a wine bar, those chips and dips! the pretzel! the beans and franks! the tomato soup and grilled cheese! and lets not forget the best cheese plate I have ever had, and yes I eat cheese plates EVERYWHERE I go, for reals. Yummy rotating well priced wines by the glass, HUGE glass of mirobrewed COLD beer for $4, beer you will not find anywhere else in PHX on tap, well maybe at that yard place but who wants to go there? Great atmosphere, the seating could be a bit better, and the space could be utilized a bit better too. But that is also part of the charm, and intimate quaintness! GREAT music, really nice service, Jenna the bartender is so hot and smart and lovely ! I love that it is in an old house, and it really gives downtown phx that charm and deliciousness it needs! I miss the Roosevelt!!! Matt and Ernie, YOU ROCK!
