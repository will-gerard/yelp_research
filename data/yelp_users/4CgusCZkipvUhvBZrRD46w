Totally enjoyed Comicon but there was major trouble with ticketing on Friday.  When it is almost 115 degrees outside, it's hard to stand on line outside.  I understand the it was corrected on Saturday, but Friday was brutal.  Loved the costumes, celebrity signings, and the whole vibe.  Lots to see.   The Food court was super crowded.  They have to figure out how to handle this type of crowd. Perhaps having one priced lunch boxes might be a good idea.   All is all, I would go again!

Of course the Billy Joel Concert on June 1st was super-awesome featuring probably one of the most creative musicians to ever be born on this planet.  Those fingers on the keyboard were nothing but utterly amazing not to mention listening to those great lyrics that he created.  But let's talk about the US Airways Center AND the selling of beverages.  I could understand scamming people into buying a 10.50 beer because you ARE at a concert and that's what you do.  BUT------ BUT-----  $6.00 for a bottle of water??? That is beyond the pale of greed--- People in Phoenix heat NEED water before they dehydrate.  The body in these Phoenix temperatures is in a constant state of dehydration even after being in the arena.  I would pay 3.50 for water still knowing that the greed factor is in play, but realizing that my body (our bodies) need water.  So scam up the beer, the liquor, the food (that's a whole other review), but don't scam the water. Not in PHOENIX.

I am a native New Yorker where the best Chinese food exists in almost every corner.  There is no such thing as bad Chinese food in NY.  I tried the chinese food here and it is EXCELLENT.  Had the egg drop soup and the won ton soup.  The wonton soup was off the charts. Wonderful flavorful broth with a truly meaty wonton with very light dough.  Amazing. Also had the chicken with honey walnuts.  I couldn't believe the amount of walnuts given as well as the lightness of the batter.  We also had beef chow fun with gravy.  As good as it gets.  Of course the place is not upscale but I didn't go there to eat the walls, tablecloths or the booths. It's a place with delicious food and good value.  The people were all very personable and polite.  They answered the many questions we had since it was our first time there.  We also had dessert.  The darkest chocolate ice cream I have seen in a long time.  Yummy.  All this for under $25.  Can you believe it?  Get there!

I hate when this happens.  You go to a restaurant you "super-like' and then upon your return it fizzles out like a second rate firecracker.   The last time this place got 5 stars from me.  Here's what happened last night.    We started off with an order of two soups:  Egg drop and Wonton.  I remembered the fabulousness of the wonton soup in the past.  Delicate, very delicate wontons in an extraordinarily delicious broth.  Couldn't wait to taste it again. Ordered Chow Mein with beef which came with brown sauce. Told the waitress to keep the brown sauce separate.  She said she didn't quite think she could do this.  She said she could give me the noodles separate, the beef separate and the brown sauce separate.  I asked, "Couldn't you do the noodles with the beef and just the sauce separately?  She said she would have to talk to the cook as he has never done this before.  Reminds me of the movie "FIVE EASY PIECES" with Jack Nicholson.  He asked for a tuna on toast and the waiter said he could have a tuna sandwich but not on toast because they don't have tuna on toast on the menu.  I will say no more.  You just HAVE TO watch the movie.    We also ordered orange chicken and asked if we could have it without breading and very spicy.  She said yes. We added an order of fried tofu which came with a sauce similar to the ones served with dumplings.  The soups arrived and the wonton soup was not what I remembered it to be.  (You guys are not going to start questioning my memory are you?)   The broth was mediocre and while the wonton were delicate, they were not flavorful.  Hubby said the egg drop soup was OK. (that means not so good in husband-speak).  The orange chicken arrived as requested, no breading. But with no spice.  He had to add spice from a metal jar on the table which was nothing more than pepper flakes in oil.  Does anyone want to consciously add oil to their food?  Don't most of us try to avoid adding calories if possible?  The preferred method to add spiciness to a dish is for THE COOK to sauté the meat WITH HOT PEPPERS thereby imparting a nice overall spiciness to the dish.  But this was not to be so spicy oil it was.  Remarkably, the beef chow mein arrived with noodles & beef together and the brown sauce separately. Amazing.  IT COULD BE DONE!  Is this NOBEL prize worthy?  The chef was actually able to serve noodles & beef together and the sauce separately????!!   Should we be sharing this accomplishment with other restaurants or with the FOOD NETWORK?    I marveled at the large amount of "brown sauce" they put on the side.  What exactly is in that brown sauce.? I'm afraid to ask.  But it seems that this brown sauce is their "go to" sauce for almost every dish.  Back to the dish.  The chow mein noodles were totally dry but the beef was moist enough to eat.  I now understand the purpose of the brown sauce--basically it wets down dry food, in this case the noodles.  I ate some of it but will tell you now that I would not ever order this dish again.  The fried tofu came out in blocks resembling kids play blocks; maybe a bit smaller.  Not greasy but not the most pleasant tasting tofu I've had either.  The soy-sauce based sauce that came with it is a MUST HAVE if there is any chance of you swallowing this tofu.  Another dish I would not order again.  Don't get me wrong.  I eat tofu.  I like tofu.  I order tofu all the time (and eat it).  It's just that the preparation in this tofu dish was really, really lacking.   And now for the good parts.  The portions are very generous.  The waitress was very nice and wanted us to accommodate us at the table of our choice since the TV was showing football and hubby's eyes immediately went to the screen.  (Gee, how unusual. ) Finally the pricing is very reasonable.  You can't go wrong with the prices, but then again you can't go right with the food either.  I, for one, am not returning.

I went there Friday night to try it out on the recommendation of so many Yelpers.  The place was neat and clean and the wait staff most friendly.  We immediately received chips with salsa and curtido( a type of coleslaw.) Didn't really like the curtido, lacked vinegar and some herbs.  But the chips were amazing.: warm, crispy and not greasy.  Nice start. I order the pork chop with plantain, rice mixed with frijoles and salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful, but being a really good cook of latin food I am going to make this recommendation to the cook.  Never add tomato sauce to rice because it makes the absorption of water difficult and makes the rice sticky.  Use Goya's Sason for coloring or tumeric.  That said, my significant other ordered the baked fish dish (because HE is watching is girlish figure) with plantains and salad.  He really enjoyed it.  I ordered a pupusa because I had never, ever, ever had one.  I ordered the one with pork cracklings, beans and cheese.  It was good.  By the way, both entrees can with a side order of pupusa.   Too full to try dessert but they had some interestingly delicious offering.  I think the meal was worth the money.  Try it.

Came for produce since I was in the neighborhood.  They have the best, freshest, produce at the most amazing prices.  Avocados 5 for $1,  Celery 79 cents,  Papaya at 88 cents a pound.  Where in the world can you get these prices except for Food City.  There were meats on sale including chicken for 47 cents a pound.  Couldn't buy because I didn't have a cooler to keep the meats chilled.  Great clean supermarket.

Buy all your produce here if you want the bargain of your life.  Cilantro sometimes 4 for $1.  Today I bought avocados & mangoes 4 for $1.  They always have some great specials.  Tomatoes were 4 lbs for one dollar.   Butcher department is good too.  Go there in a leisurely fashion and do an aisle by aisle so you can find the best bargains that you need for your pantry.  But don't forget their produce!!!

First time at MB Motors based upon Yelpers' recommendations.  Normally, I would go to the dealership and then cry on the way home after seeing the bill.  Gave these people a chance when my Mercedes had a noise and then showed the check engine light.  I am a cautious person so I was not driving the car with that light on without having a mechanic check it out.  Spoke to Jamie who assured me I could drive it in because it might be spark plugs or something to do with emissions.  As soon as I drove in, Bud, the mechanic/owner identified the noise as having to do with the power steering. Good hearing, experience, or both?  The problem was identified and after I picked up the next day, my car was driving beautiful with no noise and no "check engine" light.   I always wish my car repair bill was lower but considering that they also did some brake maintenance work as well,  I think the price would have been significantly higher at the Dealership.   It was also a nice place to be people-wise.  Jamie, was very nice AND professional.  She also did me a big favor of driving me to a place to eat considering that the pickings are slim in their "iffy"neighborhood.  Super cool young lady.  Thanks. Jamie.

If you need anything for your tools--parts, service, anything at all, this is the place for you.  Good service, good pricing, professional service.   It's the place to go to for your tools. Don't bother with Home Depot on this one.

I saw Giuseppe's on the food channel and decided to try it with family from New York. Red sauce was good (not too sweet as sauces tend to be in Phoenix) and fettucini alfredo (homemade noodles) was excellent.  However, the portion of fettucini  alfredo was small  enough that a 9 year old inhaled it in minutes.  Ordered sides of meatballs.  $2 for each meatball the size of a golf balls.  We couldn't believe it.  We also couldn't believe that you have to pay for bread in an italian restaurant! The chocolate cake was divine. There is no question that the food is of a good quality--nothing even close to NY but for Scottsdale it is fine.  Giuseppe's should reconsider the price of those meatballs and making people pay for bread--a staple of any Italian meal. .

Tried this restaurant this past Friday for the first time.  Fodor's called it the best restaurant in Phoenix, etc etc.  Someone told me they had a coupon for  two entrees, two salads or soup and a bottle of wine for $44. Sounds fair, right?  We were served two pieces of bread (one for each of us) with oil infused oil.  The one I make at home is better.  Not enough herbs to really flavor it.  We asked for more bread and they didn't seem happy.  Two pieces of bread again.  Never saw that before, counting the heads at the table and then matching the bread pieces. Most restaurant give you a chunk of bread and that's that. The salads were small, fresh but nothing special (what do you want for a coupon???)  The entree choices for the coupon were either pastas or chicken dishes everything is excluded unless you want to pay more.(what do you want with a coupon???) No side dishes come with it. You have pay extra.  (What do you want with a coupon?) I ordered chicken a la berto. Which had fontanelle cheese, spinach, and pancetta.  It was just ok. nothing special.  I didn't bring my magnifying glass to find the pieces of pancetta. (what do you want with a coupon???)  My husband hated his.  I tasted it. Flavorless.  It was chicken something. The word Oggi was in it  and his attraction to the dish was that it had sun dried tomatoes.  I think they took one sun dried tomato, cut it in half and then took that half and cut that half into minuscule pieces and spread it around the plate. As I said before, I didn't have my magnifying glass with me to let him see what mini- sun dried tomatoes look like.. My poor hubby, no sun dried tomatoes for you! (What do you want with a coupon?)  We ordered a side dish, for which we paid extra, of rigatoni with marinara sauce. Rigatoni was cooked al dente perfectly and the sauce was good.  But not better than the one I make at home from scratch from fresh tomatoes.  Don't you guys expect restaurant food to be better than your own?  I do. And finally, the bottle of wine. Not the best and a little vinegary.  (what do you want with a coupon?)  I guess everyone knows the conclusion to this review.  If Fodor's called La Fontanella the best restaurant in Phoenix, then Phoenix is a very small town with very few italian restaurants.  I, for one, will not be going back with or without a coupon.  By the way, I have eaten at Bel Fiore's, an unpretentious, no white table clothed restaurant on Cave Creek and the food is one thousand times better.  And I don't need a coupon to eat there.

Tried Tutti Santi for the first time ever.   Looked at the menu online and figured out that I wanted the Eggplant Parm with Spaghetti.  Gee how novel of me!  I love eggplant.  Was nicely surprised by the complimentary garlic bread.  Very fresh and very garlicky so if you like garlic you will delight in it.  Found out that I could have either soup or salad with my entree.  I didn't know that.  I guess I didn't read the menu that carefully.  I opted for the white bean soup and my dining companion opted for the salad.  Both the soup and the salad were quite nice.  Yelpers had been saying that their salad was iceberg lettuce.  Nope.  It was what they call green lettuce with a few slices of tomato with a very light dressing.  We had asked for no dressing but what the heck, we weren't going to send it back.  Hubby ordered a chicken cutlet milanese with slices of eggplant with "fra diavolo" sauce (spicy stuff) .  It arrived without the sauce but that was quickly corrected.  I totally enjoyed the eggplant and the spaghetti.  Although, my spaghetti came with cheese on it already.  I usually don't put cheese on my pasta.  I like it just the way it is--I want to enjoy the complexities of the sauce.  Well,  I didn't want to complain so I ate it and it was good.  Eggplant was good although the eggplant portion was smaller than most.  (hey, maybe I could use a reduction in calories!)  Hubb'ys dish was very enjoyable as well and with the chianti wine we ordered, we were both enjoying our food tremendously.  Wine makes everything taste better.   Vincent provided good service and we appreciated the complimentary Sambuca at the end of our meal.   We think that we'll be back!

I listened to you Yelpers and went to Krua Thai for dinner Saturday night. The place is located in a nothing strip mall where you would never expect to find such a great place.   It is small, clean and attractive with booths on either side and a few tables in the middle.  Decorated with Thai artifacts but not overdone.   We were greeted in a very friendly manner and we took our time selecting from the menu because we don't do Thai food that often.  We decided on the vegetarian rolls as an appetizer, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Stir Fried Sweet Basil.  With the latter dish you get to choose what you want: Chicken, Pork, Beef or Tofu.  Shrimp is $2 extra.  I chose the tofu and asked that it be fried and then added to the dish--no problem she said.  I also asked for extra spiciness.  The veggie rolls were a nice size and delicious for $2.  Great so far.  The sweet and sour chicken came just as my hubby likes it, with no breading.  (That's why this dish chinese style is so high in calories.  The breading absorbs all the oil).  It had veggies including tomatoes.  I haven't see that before in sweet and sour chicken.  He loved it.  My Tofu dish was spicy enough for me, fresh and the tofu was fried as I had requested.  The dish even had bamboo shoots in it which I detest, but somehow it tasted good in this dish.  We were given plenty of lemon-flavored water to keep us hydrated.  We loved the food, the service and the place.  The total bill was $23.  How can you beat that for good Thai food?  Next time I'll try the Pad Thai --looked good when served to other patrons.  I'll be back!

I saw this Church's Fried Chicken place while filling up with gas at 32nd street.  I couldn't help but try them as I was a Church's Fried Chicken virgin.  My mother used to eat it ALL THE TIME in upper Manhattan in New York City where she ran a store.  I guess it was a quick, cheap lunch, but it had to be more than that as my mother was a good cook who knew how to make good chicken herself.  I walked in for the $2.99 order which seemed cool (two pieces of chicken, one side and one biscuit), but after all was said and done I upgraded to an additional side and an additional biscuit--still a good value for the money.   Got home with my chicken in tow, thinking of mom all the way since I was carrying her favorite meal. Wondering if I would like it.   My two pieces of chicken were ample, crispy and not as greasy as I expected.  I have had chicken that begins with a "K"  and found it to be greasy around these parts so I was pleasantly surprised with how un-greasy it was.  The biscuits were soft like biscuits should be (not hockey-pucks).  However, they put some type of sweet glaze on it that I would have omitted.  I like my biscuits like biscuits--they are not dessert --they are supposed to complement the chicken.  I would have left that glaze off.  Would I eat them again.  Yup.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  Glad I upgraded to an extra side so now I have one in the fridge waiting for me to dig into it.   So there you have it.  Good chicken, good mashed potatoes and a pretty good biscuit.  Yelpers are complaining about the mac and cheese here.  SO DON'T GET IT. Few places make real good mac and cheese.  And some restaurants feel that they have to add four cheeses to the Mac and Cheese to make it good.  NO, NO, NO, NO.  Use sharp cheddar and make a béchamel sauce, etc etc.  (can't give you my whole recipe or you will make mac and cheese as well as I do.  NO CAN DO. I want to remain the Queen of Mac & Cheese in my family!!)   Now you know the real deal---it's the mashed potatoes you should go for when you go to a Church's Chicken.  So despite the complaints by some Yelpers, the "Boss Lady" came, bought and ate Church's Chicken and liked it.  There you have it.

After seeing so many 5 stars on Yelp and craving some good italian food, Michelina's was a no-brainer.  Arrived right on time with a 6:30PM reservation and they took us the moment we arrived.  The place looked nice with white tablecloths and beautiful fresh flowers throughout.  We sat on chairs that were so comfortable that we felt the owners really considered their customers' comfort.  We ordered a house chianti which was delicious and were provided a bread basket that had the most delicious bread.  I don't know for sure but it might be from Noble Bakery.  We made a mix of olive oil, salt and pepper on our appetizer plates and had a dunk-fest with that great bread.  All entrees come with a salad which was fresh and had the most delicious balsamic-based dressing.  I'm not crazy about balsamic but this dressing was really good.  It took about 1 hour for us to get our entrees but we realized that home cooking along with the crowd made for a slow turn-around.  Hubby ordered Halibut Puttanesca, one of the special ,which was accompanied by a little pasta.  I ordered the Chicken Sorrentino which also came with pasta.  I have one word for both dishes.  UNDER-SEASONED.  My husband was silent while eating... that means one thing... either it is so delicious he can't stop eating... or he is trying to cope with an unsatisfying dish.  So I asked, how is your halibut?  He said OK.  So I asked a more meaningful question:  Would you order it again? To which I received a quick, NO.  I asked to taste his dish.  I thought the puttanesca sauce was good although a little vinegary.  The halibut was almost without salt. I might even venture to say that it had no salt.  Saltless halibut takes like nothing. Any food without salt is tasteless.   Either the cook thought that the capers and olives might over salt the dish or s/he is cooking for people with high blood pressure.  I really hate tasteless fish.  My dish suffered from the same ailment.  The chicken had no salt,  the eggplant in it had no salt.  Only the proscuitto in the dish had any salt.  Did the cook think the proscuitto's saltiness would be imparted to the chicken and the eggplant? Not so my dear, not so.  So I ate the pasta which accompanied my dish and that was it for dinner.  Glad I ate bread at the beginning of the meal as well as the salad.  You might say I had a vegetarian meal.  The Service provided by Joe was spot-on.  Otherwise, it was a disappointing meal for both of us.

This review is way overdue.  I bought several high, high end appliances from Best.  The products were amazing, delivery was perfect, and have had no problems with my purchases.  I love it when a store makes it easy to buy from them because they are NOT running bait and switches or fake rebates.  If I ever want to purchase anything again, I will go to BEST.

First time here.  Some Yelp reviewers had written that the place looked dirty and was in need of a makeover.  The place didn't look dirty at all.  What the place needs is to replace the carpeting.  Carpeting is not a good idea in most restaurants because it quickly shows its age.  Now for the important part, the food.   Ordered a glass of chianti and a salad from the happy hour menu. Very decent glass of wine for the price. The salad was freshly made, served on a chilled plate, and had a variety of items in it including artichoke hearts, black olives, onions, you know, salad stuff.  Salad was $3 off the regular price because of happy hour--I like that. They served us a basket of fresh, hot bread accompanied by herbed butter.  Very good bread--so got we got seconds.    One order was Chicken Marsala ($18.95) with penne and vegetables.  Hubby thought the marsala sauce was a tad too salty and that the chicken (because it was thin) was slightly overdone.  The tastes were good and the red sauce on the penne was very good. My Pasta Romantica ($21.95)was made with 6 shrimp, capers, marinara sauce and cognac.  I had them use angel hair as I don't like heavy pastas.  OMG.  I wanted to start dancing on the table after my first bite. (That means I liked it).  The flavors were amazing with the caper flavor shining through and perfuming the pasta with its essence.  You didn't know I was a poet did you?  I was in awe of this dish.  Their marinara sauce is really, really good so building on this great sauce is easy.  I couldn't finish the dish because it was really a large portion but I packed it because I am going to have another amazing dinner tomorrow.  We finished off our meals with iced amaretto.  Blake, our server, was very attentive and responsive to our questions and requests.   Roma's prices are higher than their local competitors and I found that the pricing on their actual restaurant menu was higher than those posted on the internet.  I don't mind paying more money for good food so we shall definitely be returning.  Next time I'll check into Yelp and get 10% off my bill, or so I hear.

I followed the lead of Yelpers who reviewed Golden Wok as having some of the best chinese food in the valley.  I thought to myself:  How could you have missed this place with great food when I don't live that far from it?   Well, I shall start by forgiving my fellow Yelpers who think this is great chinese food.  You are forgiven, my brethren.   As a former East Coaster who has had the taste of REAL chinese food, I have to break it to you.....THIS IS NOT IT.   The egg drop soup was tasteless which means that a good broth was not developed to create a good soup.  With any good soup,  the base is what makes it.  Plus it was too clumpy from the cornstarch.   The combination dinner which consisted of orange chicken, an egg roll and "fried" rice was a total disappointment.  Orange chicken was nothing more than dough around pieces of chicken with no orange flavor.  They put a few pieces of orange rind as a costume for the chicken.  But even on Halloween night,  this plain-old chicken knows it is not orange chicken.     The egg roll, while not greasy, had little flavor and the veggies inside had no crunch.  The frozen egg rolls I buy from Chung Kung are tastier---really.  The "fried" rice.... anyone notice that I put quotation marks around the word fried???? All you English majors probably noticed it.   This cannot be called fried rice.  They took a large batch of cooked, white rice, sautéed it with soy sauce and put it in a holding tank waiting for some sucker to order their combination dinner which comes with "fried" rice.  Then, they scoop out a half a cup of the stuff and fling it on the plate along with the other mediocre part of the combo.  Does this sound a little harsh or angry?  Yup, I'm angry that we ordered something called orange chicken with FRIED rice and this so called fried rice is an insult to the palate.  Do they think that we think this is what fried rice tastes like?  Do they think we (by we I mean anyone who steps foot into that restaurant) are ignorant consumers?  I order the monogolian beef which had a good taste but you needed to have your incisors working perfectly to chew through the meat.  Glad I was at the dentist a few days ago and my incisors are in great shape.   Ladies and gentlemen of the Yelping Community:  This is NOT good chinese food.  Save your money.

No wonder this 5 and Diner has the highest ratings of them all.   Had a delightful lunch with precious teenage granddaughter.   BBQ burger perfectly cooked with amazingly delicious, un-greasy french fries.   She totally enjoyed it. I tried the chicken pot pie that came with a salad.  Salad was perfunctory chopped iceberg lettuce with tiny pieces of tomato, croutons and cheese.  Not interested in salad anyway but  hoping to be wowed by the chicken pot pie.   AND I WAS!!!   Delicious pie with lovely crust and moist inners with chicken and veggies.  Nice job. Loved it so much that I ate the whole thing even though it was just lunch time.   Service from Diane was attentive without being overbearing.  Loved her service style.   Thanks to all at 5 and Diner who made this lovely lunch possible.

Do I really have to give them even one star?   In the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes: 1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that. 2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer. 3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the "shrimp"( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the "barrel of fried batter" was left 4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen. Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.   It is an outrage as a "restaurant".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's. Don't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off.   and.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation.

Looking for an italian place that wouldn't be too far from the Gila River Casino where I was going to take in a show.  Didn't want to eat at their food court.  (Even though I really like the PHO at their Ginger Star food court stand).  No.  I wanted a sit down dinner with really good italian food. After all, it was Saturday night.  I gave them a call before I headed out.  These days you never know who has gone out of business the day before. Things are just that volatile in the restaurant business.  They answered and I asked if I needed reservations.  The man said, to be safe, reserve.  OK, reservations for two it is.   When we got there all the tables were empty minus two.  There was one with an acrylic sign on it that read "RESERVED" at one of the tables.  Before I could open my mouth to tell them that I had reservations, a young lady pointed to a table in the back corner and brusquely told us to "sit there".  The table with the "RESERVED"sign on it was a better situated table, but I didn't want any conflict so I sat where I was told to sit.  We were served a mix of olive oil, herbs and balsamic vinegar with some fresh bread by yet another server.  A tall, young, attractive african american woman who seemed to glide as she walked. Very graceful.  The bread was fresh enough but nothing to get excited about. Reminded me of hot dogs rolls split in half, but they were not.  The dipping sauce was not very tasty and as usual I added a few flecks of salt to amp up the flavors.  Needed something, but as I was here to eat and not to cook, I didn't bother trying to figure out what was lacking.  I got it!!!  A few fresh garlic cloves and some freshly chopped basil would have done it!    We ordered the Chicken Marsala & Chicken Piccata which came with a salad and a side of pasta for $17 each.  The internet indicated the price as $16 but we all know it takes time to update a website so we accepted the up charge.  The salad was iceberg lettuce, a few pieces of tomato, two black olives, two slivers of red cabbage, two slivers of carrots and mozzarella cheese.  It was ok for what it was-- a side salad.  Hubby kept counting the ingredients in it as he had visions of the salad I make him nightly one hour before his dinner.  It has many, many ingredients: mixed greens,  Kale, red cabbage, broccoli crowns, radishes, walnuts, grape tomatoes, red onion, cranberries-- sometimes feta cheese or blue cheese depending ..in a tangerine or apple cider vinegar vinaigrette . They are indeed hearty, healthy delicious salads.  I think he is spoiled to the core, don't you?  So what I was thinking as he counted the ingredients?  "Shut up, you're not home.  Eat it and smile".   Our entrees arrived, one marsala, one piccata.  Each has two slices of chicken breast in their respective sauces.  The slices were very, very, very thin.  I would say that they were about 1/4 in thickness.  No kidding. No fooling.  Both dishes had sliced mushrooms on them.  Mine had two pieces of artichokes (I think from a can) and a minor sprinkling of mini-capers.  I could have done without the artichokes--added nothing to the dish.  I could have used more capers.  I love capers.  I think that's why I order the dish.  I like the lemony, caperish taste on the meat and sauce.  The sauce was not lemony enough or "caperish" enough.  And the sauce was runny--on both dishes.  Hubby's marsala was just ok.  Not enough of that Marsala wine taste.   After eating 3/4 of one MY "weight watchers sized" cutlets, I passed my entire plate for hubby to finish.  After all, it was in my best interest.  If he didn't eat beyond what was on his plate, I would have to cook when I got home after the show.  He would never force me to, but after he starts rummaging through the fridge you know I feel guilty enough to make him at least an omelette--a smoked salmon omelette.  That's one of his favorites.  Getting back to the rest of the meal-- So after giving away my chicken to "the other side",  I concentrated on eating the side of pasta I was given.  Angel hair with marinara sauce; he had the ziti with the sauce.  The sauce was OK, but was nothing special.  Average.   Yes, I ate it.  Had to.  Nothing left for me to eat.  What was interesting was that hubby had asked for the sauce on his ziti to be FRA DIAVOLO.  It is a spicy marinara sauce.  So the waiter had said to this request, "No problem."  I was so impressed that he knew about this sauce that I said to him, "Do you know that some restaurants don't know what FRA DIAVOLO sauce is ?" He smiled and said, "We know."  So low and behold (what exactly does low and behold mean? Does anyone know?) his FRA DIAVOLO SAUCE was nothing more than the sauce I got, but with red pepper flakes on it!  Like the flakes you put on your pizza!  Wow, what a let down.  Service by the waiter- very welcoming, cordial and polite.  Clean restaurant, good intentions, but below average food.

Granddaughter bought a few items here. The store is small but full of merchandise.  Nobody bugged us while we shopped.  Quick checkout.  A little overpriced for stuff made in China but that's the way it is these days......

My review is only for the spring rolls which I got as take out.  I asked that tofu be used instead of shrimp.  They were $6.99 for 3.  Nice size and full of fresh greens and enough tofu.   I checked out their menu and plan to try their PHO.  I have had PHO in many places (worldwide) and I know what a good PHO is.  I will report on my adventure with PHO at Tea Light Cafe as soon as it happens.

Found the Keurig coffee maker I was looking for which came with a bunch of accessories in the box.  Was able to use a 20% coupon and a $5 off coupon.  That is sooooo cool about this store.  I saved $29.   The cashier was quick and very friendly.  I like this place.

It's great to walk into a restaurant recommended by Yelpers and get the feeling that it is going to be a good meal.  Traditional chinese decor without being gaudy.  Quickly treated to free tea and  served crispy, fresh, non-greasy noodles.  How attentive!  Even the table has the traditional condiments right on it (soy sauce, real-hot mustard, duck sauce).  Nowadays you have to ask for these as restaurants are cutting down, and the mustard is not the great strong Chinese mustard--it is a watered down type.  Ordered soups: egg drop which had bits of chicken in it and wonton.  The egg drop was very good and the broth of the wonton soup was delicious--the wontons lacked meat inside or at least one of the wonton did not have meat but for $2.25 each I cannot complain about a thing!  Ordered Schezehan chicken,chicken fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce.  I wanted to try the shrimp with lobster sauce after the fiasco I experienced at Qwik Chinese Bistro in Scottsdale.  You can read the details in that review.  This one did not let me down.  12 large shrimp in a nice, non-sweet sauce with water chestnuts.  Lovely and delicious.  Made me forget about the prior fiasco.  The chicken fried rice was a large, delicious plate of a multi-ingredient rice. Wow, and they added bean sprouts which i think really makes it even better.  The Schezuhan chicken was made without breading and spicy just as he ordered it.  What a great meal this was.  With our check came the typical fortune cookies AND as a bonus, wontons filled with mashed bananas with powered sugar.  These were better than you might expect.  Such a simple treat and yet so delicious.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  The service was spot-on without being overbearing.  I had to bag up the shrimp and lobster sauce that's how large the portion was. BTW, pricing is very reasonable and the service was impeccable.   Thanks to all at GOLDEN GATE who made this delicious meal possible!

Hunger struck and Happy Food was nearby.  The place was clean with a number of useless aquaria, meaning that they were not attractive, not kept properly and scum had accumulated on the glass.  The purpose of an aquarium is to bring some beauty to the surroundings.  This was not the case but the least of this restaurant's problems.   The pricing was rather inexpensive and was surprised that the lunch combinations included 3 choices plus fried rice for 5.89.  Crazy, right?  I ordered the pork chow mein, vegetable egg foo yung & an egg roll as my choices to be accompanied with fried rice.  My eating partner just had an egg drop soup.  It took a while for the orders to come so I took that as a sign that everything was freshly prepared.   The orders came in styrofoam containers.  My pork chow mein was a 2 on a scale of 5, the vegetarian egg foo yung came as a hockey puck so I would say it is also a 2, the egg roll was small (that's Ok) with veggies.  It was not over fried.  The fried rice that came with the dish was inedible---hard grains of rice stuck together.  You had to put a fork in it to dislodge the grains.  I did not eat it.  I ate what I could of the combination keeping in mind that I had only paid $5.89 for it.  The egg drop soup looked gelatinous--full of corn starch, but the person eating it said it was not bad. Does that also mean not good?   The woman who took our order and our payment never came by to ask how the food was which to me is an indicator that a restauranteur takes his/her  business seriously.  You certainly want customer feedback.  I would not have been cruel but instead made constructive suggestions.  I still don't understand why they give a choice of 3 items for the combos.  That is taxing on the cook--making 3 dishes for each lunch ordered UNLESS, UNLESS... it is all pre-prepared and all he is doing is re-heating it on the wok.  Just thinking....  Anyway, this is NOT a place where I will ever be seen again.  I usually give restaurants a second go round, but I cannot do it here.  The food is just too sub-par. Frankly, I don't know how they stay in business.    If this restaurant had been really good, I would have driven from home (13 miles away) to eat here--that's how loyal I am to a good restaurant.   Stay away folks.... there is nothing here that you want.

Went there a week ago for the express purpose of finding Unripened bananas (green) and unripened plantains.  My visit achieved its purpose because I did find both items.  green bananas cannot be found anywhere  in the valley.  I was told by someone that Lee Lee's had them and they were right.  FYI:  Green bananas can be boiled with salt water and are better for you than potatoes AND they can also be grated to make a mash that can be used to make Puertorican "Pasteles".  Long story, long recipe. I was also able to find banana leaves which can be used to poach fish.   What was disappointing were the high prices on produce and the stuff did not appear to be that fresh.  Sprouts Market has cheaper prices on produce.  I think anybody does. I will admit that you can find anything asian you want --- even cow uterus (Now don't be judgmental!) You can also find items from many countries as well.  However, you will pay the price for it.  So from a price point of view, Lee Lee's does not give you a bargain.  What Lee Lee's will do is get you anything asian/foreign you need for a recipe.  So for many of you it might be worth it.  I don't think I will be returning unless I need the green bananas again for Pasteles.

We tried this Cheesecake Factory after having a dismal experience at another Cheesecake factory further north than this one.  A couple's dinner and we ordered the following: Avocado Salad,  Fresh and delicious.  Not overdressed.  Chicken Piccata with pasta and plenty of Parmagiano Reggiano, grated right in front of you.   Delicious and perfectly made. Eggplant Parmagiana with Pesto Pasta,  Really delicious.  Sauce was great.  Pesto pasta was not overly aggressive with garlic.  It was just right.   Kobe Burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and sweet potato fries. Had this because there were no turkey burgers.  The Kobe Burger was OK but nothing to write home about.  Sweet potato fries were good.   The bread was delicious but we had to ask about 3 times before we got our first service of bread although the place was not packed.  Tasty bread.  Other than that, the service was good as they kept our waters refreshed.   I will admit that I was shocked by how good their pasta dish was.  I normally don't even try italian dishes at non-italian restaurants but the waiter, Jesus, convinced me it was a wonderful dish.   It was refreshing to go to a Cheesecake Factory and have a meal that I don't have to complain about.  I just want good food and good service and I got it at this Cheesecake Factory.

I don't know how this store is getting 4 stars.  Went there yesterday for a number of items.  Bought maybe 1/5 of what I was looking for.  The final item that I wanted was a hand cleaner such as Goop which mechanics used the clean their hands.  I asked two lady employees who were chatting it up and they told me aisle 63 or 69.  I wandered in the direction they pointed to and as I passed another Lowe's employee, he asked me what I was looking for.  I told them aisles 63 or 69.  He smiled and said, "we don't have those aisle numbers".  He then proceeded to escort me personally to where the cleaner might be.  It was not there and told me to wait for him that he would find out.  Well, it was about 8 minutes and I was standing there like a fool and decided to give up on this purchase.  On my way out of the store I saw him and he apologized for keeping me waiting but discovered that they did not carry the brand I was looking for.  As for the ladies who misled me to those nonexistent aisles.  I hope you had a good laugh while I was walking around looking for the aisles.  Perhaps that was my punishment for interrupting your chat fest.

Father's Day visit.  35 minute waiting time was to be expected.  Ordered the chicken matzoh ball soup, nova plate, chopped chicken liver plates (with bagel chips) and a whole wheat bagel.   The matzoh ball soup gets a 3.  Lots of celery and carrots in a kinda of leaning toward salty broth.  Matzoh balls had no deliciousness about them but weren't hard.  A little black pepper and minced parsley would do miracles for them not to mention a dusting of garlic powder before you mix them.  Trust me I know.  Hubby will kill for my matzoh balls.   The Nova plate had a generous amount of nova with a bagel, capers, red onion.  Nice.  But hubby who is an expert on nova says on a scale of 1-10 it is just a 7.  Considering this is a jewish-type deli that is NOT good.  It should have a wow factor and it does not.  Supermarket nova is not too far behind Chompie's nova and that should not be.   The chopped chicken liver was uneventful.  I left most of it.  Lacking in chopped egg and onion and perhaps Schmaltz.  Does anyone use schmaltz anymore?  Finally and sadly,  I cannot get a good bagel at a bagel/jewish deli????? Are you pranking me? Was there a hidden camera in Chompie's catching my reaction when I tasted the "whole wheat" bagel.  It was sooooo mealy I cannot begin to describe it to you.  I expected to able to crunch into my toasted whole wheat bagel.  When I asked the waitress about it, she said it was a multi-grain/whole wheat bagel--they kind of combine it.  Ah-ha!!!!!  My bagel radar does not deceive me.  It was the most awful texture I have even experienced in a bagel.  As a kid I used to buy frozen "Lender's" bagels and toasted them.  I will tell you right now that the whole wheat Lender's bagels was 1000% (not a mistake I wrote one thousand) better than what I experienced today at a Chompie's.... R U kidding me.?  Sorry Chompie's but I speak the truth.     The two stars are for the service which did not miss a beat despite the crowds on Father's Day.

A Charming 50's diner theme with reasonably priced food. Great Chicken pot pie which came with a salad.  Wonderful crust and not greasy. Nicely prepared turkey burger with lettuce and tomatoes with a side of fries.  Those fries were really crispy and delicious.   Had an apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream for $3.99!  Can you believe it?  They seem to use Breyer's ice cream which I love.  Love to see the little specs of vanilla in the ice cream. Can't believe we got great food and service and didn't spend a ton of money.

Wonderful community theatre with several small stages within it.  Saw Rumors at the Actor's Cafe which is a very small venue.  Sat in the second row because if I sat in the first row I would probably be on stage!   A nice place to enjoy the arts in the heart of Scottsdale.

Had a wonderful dinner with John as our chef.  Everything he prepared was to perfection.  There is a tendency of hibachi chefs to overcook food especially the shrimp.   This was not the case.  So happy that the shrimp was cooked perfectly for a change!  Thanks John!

I really loved my server Ashley and the lit Eiffel Tower in the center of the restaurant.   Now for the bad part. We ordered the spinach/frisee salad, duck confit with white bean cassoulet and steak with "frites"  Two drinks were ordered: a bloody mary and a french martini recommended by Ashley.  Both drinks were well prepared and strong.  The spinach/frisee salad was fresh with bacon dressing, a poached egg and lardons.  It was fresh but nothing to write home about.  The duck leg confit was ABYSMAL.  While my husband  was eating  I saw his unenthused expression, so decided to take a taste of it.  THE DUCK LEG HE WAS SERVED HAD TO HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND THEIR REFRIGATOR FOR A WHILE PRIOR TO BEING SERVED.  I cannot believe that Zinc Bistro would serve such an unappetizing, unflavorful , dry "meat".   When we got home, I asked my husband why he didn't tell the waitress how bad his food was and his answer was that he didn't want to spoil my birthday dinner.  I would have been kicking and screaming before I would eat anything so vile.  My steak and frites were NOTHING LIKE I AM USED TO IN PARIS!!!   The steak was cooked medium rare,  au poivre but the meat had no flavor whatsoever.  It also had an excessive amount of peppercorns.  A person who sat across from us returned his steak because of this.  I have eaten steak au poivre many times both in the US and abroad.  This is definitely an excessive use of  peppercorns. None of the restaurants I have experienced do it this way.  Doesn't mean that Zinc Bistro can't be unique.  But, it must be unique and edible.  The frites  were a total disappointment.  They could NOT HAVE BEEN FROM FRESH POTATOES---NO WAY, NO HOW . No WAY, NO HOW... HOW MANY TIMES CAN I SAY THIS?  In Parisian bistros the frites or fries are to die for---simply sprinkled with salt and they are amazing.  Zinc Bistro's fries had this or that sprinkled on them but this did not improve the lack of flavor from the potato.  OMG,  what can I say about a restaurant that  charges more than a Parisian  bistro but none of its flavor.   One saving grace was that they gave me a complementary mini-chocolate souflee as I was celebrating my birthday.   Zinc Bistro management.... check that duck confit dish.... go into the kitchen right now and taste it.   Get ready to spit it out.   I am feeling super-uber guilty that my husband ate that vile dish and kept quiet about it so he wouldn't spoil my birthday dinner.   Zinc Bistro,  how long can this quality of food continue before Scottsdale patrons realize that they are not eating anything like what is served in a Parisian Bistro.   I have to give Zinc Bistro one star--earned by Ashley and the complementary chocolate souffle.

First time at the Cheesecake Factory despite passing by it so many times.  I thought of it more as a dessert place and in my head I associated it with kids--a kid's place.  Checked it out Saturday night for dinner.  Quite crowded but we were seated within twenty minutes.  With such an extensive menu, it took us a while to figure out what we wanted.  It was difficult to read the menu as we were on the patio and the lamp overhead had a burned out bulb.  We used the small tea light on the table to shed some light on the menut. After consulting with our waitress, Kourtney A., we ordered the chicken marsala and the fried shrimp platter. In the interim, we were served warm breads with butter.  Really fresh warm bread.  The fried shrimp platter was  amazingly large .  Lots of shrimp, fries with a delicious coleslaw.  Small sauces for dipping were also provided.  I couldn't believe how tasty the shrimp were--not greasy, not too much breading.  The chicken marsala ,which was served with bow tie pasta ,was perfectly cooked and delicious. It was a generous portion-- A real winner of a dish.   We really enjoyed the service Kortney provided as well the good meals we had.  We'll be back.

I have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times before at this particular location.  Brought visiting granddaughter here today.  Bad move. Ordered the chicken samosa appetizer, 4 small greasy wontons filled with chicken.  Doesn't anyone know how to fry anymore?  Why so greasy, pray tell? 380 degrees and they will be virtually greaseless.  These, were NOT.  I didn't complain.  Ordered two red sangrias.  Sangrias came out with lots of ice (less Sangria) and very watery tasting.  I know good Sangria--it's in my genes---but this was NOT it.  Have you noticed that they don't give you the pricing on some of the drinks?  Well, my dear readers, these watery sangrias were $9.50 a piece plus tax and tip.  I will pay $15 for a good drink folks, but I hate being taken for a ride.  But I did not complain.  After all, I was taking a lovely guest out.    Ordered one of my favorites, Fried shrimp in the basket with french fries and cole slaw.  Doesn't seem like such a big deal but when shrimp are freshly fried and delicious nothing beats them.  These, were NOT.  Something very strange with these shrimp.  Firstly, two different colors/tones (see photo).  I tasted the darker, flatter one first. Tasted like frozen shrimp from the supermarket, Carnation brand, or perhaps Sea-Pak?  The lighter, curlier shrimp tasted like it was pre chewed--no really.  It's just an expression but what I meant was that it was mushy inside.  Almost like a shrimp paste --they tasted like the precooked shrimp that come in a ring which were battered and then fried.  Very strange.  Granddaughter's theory was that the darker shrimp were leftover from someone else's plate and re-fried and served to me. Yuk at the thought).  I tried to eat them and ate two and then I said, why are you doing this to yourself?.  When our server, Dylan B, came around I couldn't help but to try to describe what the issue was with these shrimp.  I started with... "I know you didn't cook this, but....."   Dylan B listened and apologized.   As we were about to leave a man (manager) came by to ask us how everything was.  I explained the shrimp fiasco.  He gave me an "explanation" or how when shrimp are fried and they stick together, one gets darker than the other.  Excuse me Mr. Manager, when was the last time you cooked a dinner?  I am quite a cook so Storytime Theatre didn't work for me.  Then he apologized and left.   Gee, everybody loves to apologize. apologies are cheap.  Is that part of their training?  As long as you apologize,  patrons can eat #######.   I got the bill which amounted to $90.  No accommodation for the horrible meal I had or for the fact that I didn't even have dinner.  No small credit for the lousy shrimp, no slice of cake to make up for it nada, Nyet.   So for $90, I had inedible shrimp, coleslaw overridden with mayonnaise, two watery Sangrias and greasy Samosas.   My husband enjoyed his Chicken Marsala and that's why the ONE star.   Not good, Cheesecake Factory, Not good.

Made an appointment on-line to get tires.  Arrived at 8:50 AM and I was out the door with 4 brand new tires out the door by 9:30AM.  Super great tires for a great price and fast service.   Really happy with my purchase.

I rejoined the Y and went in for the first time last Friday.  I wanted to use the treadmills and asked a staff members which machines had TV's that worked.  "Dunno" was the answer "just go around and check them out". Thought to myself, isn't that what Y staff is for?  To know the equipment and keep it in tip top shape?   I asked other questions about the controls but the staff seemed disinterested.  I wiped down the treadmill I was going to use although the staff person did not show me where the "pull down" towels were.  I wiped down the machine before I used it and afterwards.  The next day I went again and repeated my cleaning ritual and used the machine.  By early evening on Saturday I was feel sick and it is now 8 days later and I can't shake off a horrible cold which started with a sore throat.  I haven't had a cold in 10 years because I am diligent about cleaning my hands and avoiding  things or people who don't seem to be clean.  The Y was the ONLY thing that I did differently and no one will convince me that I didn't catch something at one of Y's machines.  No way, no how.  Those machines need to be attended to and cleaned properly by staff.  The monthly fees the Y charges are NOT cheap so we should be getting clean machines for the money.  I don't know if those wiping cloths have any disinfectant in them to be effective.   Other gyms which charge less have clean machines.  The Y is supposed to be a positive, community experience.  It has not been for me thus far and I don't think I can continue attending this gym.

I must have passed this place a thousand times and admired the cool sports cars outside of it.  Finally decided to try it for lunch.  There were two couples there who were having an early lunch just like us.  The place was nicely decorated and had white tablecloths on every table.  Very nice.  We were served basil pesto in a deep, green, extra-virgin olive oil that was a complement to the bread we were served.  The pesto dip was really delicious although I thought it needed a few grains of salt to balance it out.  The bread roll was puffy and crunchy on the outside with a nice texture inside.  I like bread with holes and this one had it.  We ordered chicken parm  and hubby had a chicken cutlet with a slice of eggplant on it.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. Each came with penne with a tasty tomato sauce.  The penne were perfectly cooked al dente.  The sauce was really good-- as I like it not too sweet and not too acidic.  Nicely balanced sauce, almost NY style.  We didn't have dessert but viewed the dessert menu for future reference.  I saw that they have a ricotta/mascarpone cheese cake on the menu that I will have next time around .   What surprised me was that the two lunches were $12.95 each and the total bill was totaled as $42 and change.  What?  That is quite a math error(?) --almost $16 over.  Usually errors are a dollar here or there but not $16.  The waitress could not explain the error but corrected the bill using a calculator.  We did not under tip her as a result of this and this will not deter us from enjoying their delicious food once again.  We prefer to believe that it was an accident error.

I usually go to Morton's for quality of food and service. The quality of food is still there that's why I gave it two stars.  However, the service was terrible.  Jane was our server.  When she took our orders she ran off like a bat out of hell without answering questions we had. We had to flag her down like a taxicab to get her back to answer a question. We hadn't finished asking our questions when she ran off again. Did she have to pee, perhaps?  We summoned her again with another question but she didn't come by. We got that answered by another server.  It seems that they work in teams so you don't really get the personal attention required in a place like this.  It's like McDonald's. One person gets your fries, the other the burger, the other gets your drink. Not good.  While we were having dinner Jane asked: ARE YOU HAPPY? ( With respect to what? ) I think most appropriately it would be: IS EVERYTHING OK? or ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR MEAL? or IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE I CAN GET FOR YOU?  Like perhaps a few extra lemons slices with my shrimp that came with one lousy slice of lemon?  The guy filling the water glasses had water fall all over  my husband shirt cuffs.  Apology? Nope.  People shouldn't pay two hundred dollars for this kind of service.  Too bad. Another quality restaurant bites the dust.

Someone recommended Giuseppe's on Thunderbird and Scottsdale (not on Indian School!!- Some reviewers definitely are confusing the two!).  I drove over and ordered an Eggplant Parmagiana hero.  To me,  Eggplant (and meatballs)  are a good indicator of a good restaurant.  Good eggplant, good food.   I took the sandwich home and it was unbelievably good, if not great.  I paid only 7.50 with tax.  Next, I will order the meatballs.  but I am REALLY impressed with the Eggplant.  I understand that it's BYOB  with no corkage fee.  Will have dinner there as well.  Trust me, as an experienced NY Italian food eater, this is the real deal.  So happy to have found this place--finally great eggplant!

First time having dinner here although I have done take out sandwiches. Upon seating, I saw a woman eating a delicious looking pasta with red sauce and asked the server what it was.  It was Mostaccioli.  Yup, I wanted that.  Ordered a meatball on the side to find out what kind of meatballs they made.  Another person ordered linguini alfredo and hubby ordered his old stand by: eggplant and chicken combo which came with pasta on the side.  First they served some rustic italian bread that I liked but hubby thought was stale.  Not too stale though.  Good enough that two of us ate it without too much complaint.  It came with a garlicky herb butter that everybody liked.  Do you know that hunger makes stale bread go away?  The Mostaccioli came out looking amazing and if looking amazing was not enough, it tasted like it had been made by the Gods. It was cooked al dente perhaps more like al dentissimo, but really, really good.  The linguini alfredo was magnificent  (I was allowed to taste it only because everybody wanted to taste my amazing pasta!).  And then..... there is the story of the eggplant/chicken combo.  Firstly, the chicken was overcooked and then the most offensive of it all was that it had an over-refrigerated taste.  Have you ever kept something in the refrigerator so long that the flavors from the other foods permeated it?  Yup,  I tasted it and assured hubby that he was not going to get food poisoning that it was just a case of "we kept the chicken in the fridge too long." The overcooking, in my humble culinary opinion, is that the eggplant and the chicken are both pre-cooked and when an order comes in they put the sauce and cheese on it and then reheat it in a salamander or the oven. (IN MY HUMBLE OPINION).  So the mood was not so light at our table tonight.  You know that when the chief is not happy it is not a good thing.   But the chief was really nice about it and didn't say anything to the staff about the chicken.  Next scenario. I had my heart set on having some tiramisu so I called over the server and asked him about the tiramisu.  I was concerned about having old desserts served to me.  He went on and on about how the desserts are made by so-and so's wife and they are fresh, fresh, fresh,  etc etc etc.  As he went through his litany of desserts, he mentioned flourless chocolate cake which hubby loves.  I figured that I would make up for his bad meal by getting him the chocolate cake.  So I said, we'll have the tiramisu and the chocolate cake and almost in an arrogant, insulted fashion, he said: I'll continue telling you about the gelatos.  The fact that I already told him what I wanted was of no consequence.  He continued his litany of gelato flavors almost like Forrest Gump's buddy Bubba did as he called off the shrimp dishes from all corners of the earth.  I waited for his conclusion painfully, hoping he would turn around and get our desserts.  He did.  Finally.   Next scenario. He arrived with 3 dishes.  One with the flourless cake which was to brighten my "sunshine's" day and provide relief to the disappointment of his meal.  Another had all whipped cream in it which we were to share.  And the third dish was a "cannoli???"   Wait, wait........ wait.......  let me look more closely.....no,  it's not a small cannoli.  it's... it's.... OMG.... it's our tiramisu!!!! A tiramisu the size of a cannoli, I KID YOU NOT.  Too bad I didn't take a photo of it.  Two lady fingers (used to make tiramisu) was the extent of the tiramisu.  Never ever have we seen anything like this before.  Could have easily been one bite except I am too much of a lady to do that in a restaurant.  If I had been home with a tiramisu of that size, I would have bent my head backwards like a seal and scarfed down the entire piece in one bite.  And then to make it worse, hubby compared the flourless chocolate cake to others I have brought home for him and it did not meet his standard.  Bust #2. Score:  0-0 .  Next scenario. We get the bill and it is a slip of paper with a total amount due, non-itemized,  a few names of the dishes scribbled down but no prices-Just the total due.  Reminds me of the bills Tony Soprano used to get at his favorite haunt except that Tony didn't have to pay.  How do I know if my bill was correct?  I don't.  Do I have to sit there with a calculator??  Maybe.  And maybe someone else, not me.   Don't know what to say except that my pasta dish was amazing.  The question is whether all the other bad stuff that happened during this dinner can be made up by even the best of pastas.

I hadn't been to Red Lobster in quite a while because I don't enjoy waiting a long time for a seat and they don't take reservations.  Tonight I had a craving for shrimp and there aren't many places that  know how to fry  shrimp properly and without a ton of breading.  Red Lobster has light breading and their frying technique is excellent.  The shrimp did not disappoint.  We also ordered fried flounder which was very good.  The sides were great and the biscuits were just amazing.  Had the apple crostada with ice cream for dessert.  Everything was great... especially our server Nate who did not skip a beat.  Nice job Nate!  See u soon......

Despite other mediocre reviews by other Yelpers, I can only elevate my prior ratings.  Dinner tonight at Red Lobster was nothing short of fantastic.  Plenty of biscuits, fresh--super-fresh salads--albeit simply lettuce, grape tomatoes and red onion, but it was, I must repeat incredibly fresh and plentiful.  The fried shrimp platter was nicely done--no grease, light batter, medium sized baked potato and plenty of cocktail and tartar sauce.  The hubby ordered flounder which came with nothing less than 4 pieces along with his side order of broccoli.  I think the pricing at Red Lobster is right on point for what you get.  They don't gouge you.  The service provided by our server Katherine was perfect.  She presented herself as an attractive, polite young lady with a great smile.  Whoever trained her did an excellent job as she made our experience today at Red Lobster all the better.  Thank you Katherine.  Thanks to the management of Red Lobster who is doing a great job at making this restaurant an enjoyable place to eat.

Just tried the Red Lobster crab cakes that were advertised on TV which look so thick and delicious on screen.  The photo on the menu also made them look scrumptious.  Well, I had them as part of a combo meal and all I can say is that they were thin, over breaded and super, super, super fishy tasting.  Real crab cakes don't smell or taste like these.  I've had crab cakes in many, many restaurants and these are not it.  My server, Cheryl, didn't bother to come by to ask if I was enjoying my meal (at least the other two portions of the three item combo) .  I guess she could see that the crab cakes were not being eaten and didn't want to deal with it.   It was not my best time in Red Lobster although I have enjoyed the food here in the past.

Bean Burrito, 5 layer Burrito, an iced-tea. $5.  Sounds great to me. Tasty meal.  Clean environment.  Waited 5 minutes before anyone even spoke to me.  That's why only 4 stars.

Got a coupon in the mail for Delia's Cleaners and who doesn't love a coupon.  It had 30% off on cleaning with the exception of certain items which did not pertain to my items.  I entered and asked how much a blouse would be.  The young lady said $5.25 and up.  I had two blouses and one pair of pants.  She looked at one blouse and said, "Oh, this is a premium blouse so this will be $7.10."  I then showed her my coupon.  I expected 30% off the quoted price wouldn't you??  She goes to the register with my coupon, punches in some numbers and says, "Oh, the premium blouse is $10.25, but with the coupon it's $7.10".  I smelled scam all over the place.  I said to her, "So before I showed you the coupon, it was $7.10.  After the coupon it was $7.10.  Does that sound right to you?"  With that I took my stuff and went back to my old dry cleaners which is further away but at least are honest about quoting prices.  They don't do coupons but I would rather deal with honest people than people who send out coupons with no intentions of giving you a real price break.  This is a convenient location since I shop at Fry's and Big Lots which is in the same shopping center.  If Delia's had given me a real discount and had done a good job with the cleaning, they would have gotten 100% of all my cleaning including quilts and bedspread which I usually dry clean before it gets colder.   I just don't like the bait and switch or the maneuvering of pricing to make the public believe they are giving you a deal.  Everybody loves a deal but nobody likes a scam.

This supermarket has everything---florist, rent-a car, bank, post office branch, pharmacy, books/library corner, and a great lounge area for patrons.  I see people playing Ma-Jong and other games there.   I am particularly impressed by the fact that they have lowered their produce pricing to be more competitive with other merchants (e.g. Sprouts).  Now I am buying more of my produce at Fry's.  If they bring every produce item down to a competitive price, I will buy everything at Fry's and not have to make different stops to get the best buys.  Manager, are you reading this?????

To the reviewer that said that Qwik Chinese's food is like Chinese food back East, I have 2 words:  NO WAY.  This food does not taste like Chinese food back East.     Below average to average is a fairer description.

This rating is for the photo processing area.  Today I went to pick up slides that I had left there and also to have them rectify two poorly processed photos which I only noticed when I got home.  (I had processed over 90 photos)  So I get there and the guy I had previously dealt with was off.  Ok no problem.  I looked for help and a lady who works for Sam's was unable to look for the slides where I told her they were.  (I saw where the prior guy had stored them.)  Then, I asked for the pictures to be corrected.  At the point she advised me that all the machines were out of order.  So I spent money on gas to get to a place that doesn't even have ONE working photo machine.  Not good.  I usually get photos done at their competitor down the road, but decided to give them a try.  How does one pronounce, "Bad idea"?

Three words:  Chicken Pot Pie! It was amazingly good.   That alone was worth the trip.   Hubby had white fish with caper sauce and veggies.  Very good as well, but the chicken pot pie was the star of the show. Had apple crisp with ice cream for dessert which was way too much sweet.  I couldn't finish it (although it was small) because of the overly sweet taste. The chocolate mousse had by hubby was absolutely delicious. Came with strawberries and was the perfect sweetness.   The waitress (I forgot her name), was great as she always is. (Thin blonde lady--please thank her for us! )  BTW, we used a coupon which came in the mail for $10.  So all this yumminess cost us $23.00.  Nice!.   Thank you Mimi's and could you mail us more coupons?

Didn't want to cook on Valentine's Day and didn't want to go to a fancy pants restaurant either.  So we went local to Mimi's on Shea Boulevard.   I ordered my old standby Chicken Pot Pie which was on the menu for the longest except now it is "Nouveau Pot Pie". Nouveau meaning "new".  (Yes, I speak French. ) Unfortunately the old chicken pot pie recipe (which was delicious) does not translate to the Nouveau pot pie.  What happened to the veggies that were in the old version?  The prior recipe was damned delicious!  The new version has more dairy (probably cream and /or milk) but the only veggies my eyes could see were carrots and a few peas.  The flavor of this combination was not a winning one. The herbs de province which were in the creamy mixture do not go well with  pot pie flavors--yes, even in a "french version".  The better choice is celery which is more traditional, and of course pearl or regular onions.   Hubby had the sole with potatoes and spinach---sole is sole.  But when I heard him ask the waitress for Tabasco sauce., I knew that he was not enjoying his meal much. He doused the entire plate with hot sauce.    But this is not the end of this story.  We ordered our favorite dessert:  the chocolate mouse.  We had the "flight" of chocolate mousse, meaning we asked that the trio dessert plate be only comprised of chocolate mousse.  We asked our waitress that the raspberry jelly and strawberries that come with it be served separately and she did do that for us.   All was well with the dessert until I came upon something brown and squiggly on one of the sliced strawberries.  I didn't say anything to hubby right away because he would have spit out whatever was in his mouth at that moment and it might be hurled  right at me.  Instead, I chose not to need a change of clothes so I slowly picked up the little bowl that housed the strawberries and brought it closer and closer to me.  It was a brown grub.  Absolutely--definitely.  I then told hubby to look at the bowl to which he answered "Oh, no".  We asked the waitress to call the manager. The manager, a short, Latino fellow--don't know his name, barely looked at it before he made his "conclusion".   "It's just the bottom of the strawberry.....  it's part of the chocolate.... it's .... it's...."  and he quickly whisked the strawberries away and said "Sorry".   If i had not asked that the strawberries be served separately, I might be digesting a brown grub right about now.   The manager stuck to his corporate training script saying there was nothing wrong and it's this or it's that.... And so it ends, my years and years of eating at Mimi's has now come to an end.  Unhappy about the food, unhappy about the grub and unhappy about how it was handled.   I am grateful, however, that my eyesight is still good enough to avoid eating the grub that lay sleepily on the bright red strawberry.

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF DINING AT Mimi's Cafe & Bistro: 1.  Thou shall not get upset when the restaurant is half empty on a Saturday night but they take your name in the front of the restaurant and have you wait 9 minutes while you are staring at empty tables.   2.  Thou shalt not expect to be given a lipstick-free beer glass. Thou shalt expect the waitress to tell you these are water spots and not lipstick. (Are there red water spots?) 3.  Thou shalt not expect to be given small dishes to put your bread on. Thou shalt expect the waitress to slam them down when she finally brings them to you two at a time so you can do her job and pass the dish to the other diner. 4.  Thou shalt expect the waitress to be shocked when you ask her  if your "steak & frites" comes with a peppercorn sauce.  "A SAUCE ON STEAK?????" (Yes, just like in Paris. Isn't this a French-themed restaurant?) 5.  Thou shalt not expect your "frites" to be fried extra crispy as you requested and instead you receive them "al dente".   6.  Thou shalt not expect your waitress to be available for an extended period of time.  When you finally get another staffer to get your waitress, you could hear her from the kitchen asking: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT?  7.  Thou shalt not expect to be given a choice when you order tea.  Thou shalt expect the waitress to make the decision for you. 8. Thou shalt expect to be given a teapot with a broken top so that the steam coming out of the hole can keep you alert and on your toes. 9.Thou shalt not expect to receive a ballpoint pen with ink in it to indicate a tip and sign your bill.   10.  Thou shalt not be lured by BOGO (with purchase of two beverages) coupons to get a "FREE" meal at Mimi"s.    FREE IS NOT FREE when you can't enjoy a night out because of mediocre food and Abysmal service.     Au revoir pour toujours!!!!

Great fresh produce!  They have orange food, green food,  yellow food, everything you need in veggies and fruits.  They have some frozen foods mainly items that are organic, vegan, you know, healthy frozen foods.  They have a ton of wines very reasonably priced.  Beer too. They have food bins  for all kinds of nuts, raisins, grains, etc. by the pound.  Very good stuff.   They have a deli that sells cold cuts by the pound and I have found their prices to be a bit lower than the local supermarket down the block.  They also prepare sandwiches at a very low price (I think $2.99) soups too. They have a designated area for people to eat their sandwiches.  They sell vitamins, health bars and healthy snacks.  I find that area of the store a bit expensive.   All in all a great store.

What in carnation is happening to my once beloved Sprouts?  This was my go-to place for the best prices on produce in the Scottsdale area.  Sprouts always beat out the supermarkets.  I used to hate to have to buy everything at the supermarket except the produce and then have to drive to Sprouts for produce.  I did it because I saved a lot of money.  We're not talking about a few pennies of savings where it would have been penny wise and pound foolish to make an extra shopping trip to Sprouts.  We're talking bucks that added up.   The last few times I barely bought anything because Sprouts' prices on produce were between 20-79 cents higher than the local Fry's on 90th Street.  For example.  Fry's had Romaine Lettuce for 99 cents and Sprouts 1.69.  Cilantro 69 cents at Sprouts and 2/1.00 at Fry's.  Organic kale at Fry's?  99 cents each (not per pound).  Finding my basket nearly empty at Sprouts after having made a trip there, I went over to the deli area looking for Nathan's Hot Dogs which I had forgotten to buy at Fry's.  Low and behold, there were the Hot Dogs for 6.99 a package.  Are you kidding me?  Is someone punking me?  I usually pay 4.99 when they are NOT on sale, but $7?  Why don't I just go buy a steak?  So my point is that not only is the produce at Sprouts increasing in price but other items as well.  Disappointing.

Just picked up a 7" pepperoni pizza after seeing Nello's on Check Please Arizona on PBS.  The gentleman behind the counter at Nello's opened the VERY small box to reveal a VERY small pizza.  I said nothing about the size since it is a 7" pizza and it was just for me since I was trying it out for the family.  As I stared at it, he said:  the pepperoni is under the cheese.  He read my mind,  "Where the heck was the pepperoni?"  As I ate the first slice it took quite a bit to find a VERY, VERY thin slice of pepperoni.  Not happy.  The second slice had a thin slice of pepperoni that was visible and which I could taste.  Had a good taste but not enough to be called  a pepperoni pizza.  I paid $7.38 for this tiny pizza with virtually no pepperoni and frankly I am embarrassed at myself for being misled by a TV program and for paying such a premium price for a morsel of pizza.    The next time that I buy a pizza with pepperoni, I will check to make sure it has enough pepperoni to be called a pepperoni pizza. I don't want to have to hire a search party to find the pepperoni in my next pizza.

I had never been at K Odonnell's despite seeing 20% off coupons in The Clipper Magazine and driving past it on my way to Sam's.  Went there Saturday night.  They had their misters on for the patio but since the patio allows smoking I didn't want to take a chance that a smoker would sit next to us and puff in my face.  So inside we went.  Within seconds of getting the menu we were asked if you were ready.  I then volunteered that we had never been here before and as a result did not know the menu AND that we needed more time.  I wanted the Pork Green Chle Soup, but was disappointed that they were out of it.  Out of it??? at 7PM on a Saturday night?  Come on now!!!  I then ordered a cup of the Guinness stew and after one tablespoon I knew that this was not for me.  When something needs that much salt and pepper AND tabasco, it's time for a change.  And isn't soup supposed to be hot??  I then got the Chicken Tortilla soup which was really delicious.  My hubby decided he would drink his appetizer.  He ordered a special they had of a bloody mary made with Absolute Peppery Vodka.  I didn't know that type of vodka existed.  The drink was really good!   You didn't think I was just going to have the soup without slurping some of that delicious bloody mary, did you????  The fish and chips I ordered was plentiful.  3 nice pieces of cod made with beer batter and really crispy french fries just like I ordered them.  It came with a delicious, fresh, non-mayonaisy cole slaw.  Nice.  Hubby ordered a medium rare hamburger that came perfectly cooked and which he claimed was delicious (although I wouldn't know if you know what I mean! )  Some people don't share.  I digress.  He also ordered sweet potato fries which he said were delicious (although I wouldn't know if you know what I mean! )  Get my drift?  All in all we had a very nice tasting dinners and the pricing was just right.  We think we definitely will be back!

Hadn't been to a Chili's in years so decided to try their new menu.  Ended up with the Southern BBQ burger for granddaughter and the Endless Soup and Salad for me.  Soup and Salad sounded great  since I wasn't in the mood for meat. The BBQ burger came with delicious fries (I was allowed to taste one) and the bacon on the burger was to die for.  (I also begged to taste the bacon.)  As part of the Endless Soup and Salad, I chose the salad of mixed greens with sprinkles of queso fresco and the baked potato soup.  The salad was fresh and ample.  The soup came in a bowl which was about half full.  (See photo).  I finished the soup and the salad so I asked for portion number two.  For the second order, the soup was cold and served in a small ramekin type of "bowl" (see second photo) and a salad that was as ample as the first one.  So the soup portion got smaller when I asked for seconds, hmmmm.   Does that mean that if I asked for more soup, (remember it's Endless Soup and Salad) that the next soup portion would be served in a thimble??  Just saying.   I enjoyed the soup, enjoyed the fresh salad and my granddaughter loved her burger.   Chili's you had 5 stars until you tried to get cheap with your endless soup.  If I had gotten a normal portion to begin with, I wouldn't have asked for more.   Nice food, good prices, Chili's but don't get silly with your endless soup and salad portions otherwise don't offer it.

I can't believe how long its been since a review has been written for this restaurant.  Not by me, but by others.  Look, an authentic Chinese restaurant it's not.  Amazing food, it is not.  It is average chinese food intended for non-asians.  Period.  Clean place, polite and attentive servers.  We had egg drop soup; hot, with frozen veggies, broth lacked flavor.  $5.50 for lunch combo which included soup, vegetable fried rice, chicken chow mein, veggie egg roll and fried wontons.  Vegetable fried rice was nothing to write home about.  Chow mein was fine except maybe a tad too sweet.  Veggie roll was good.  All in all--what does anyone want for $5.50 when it includes all of these items.  If these people were super star chefs, it would be reflected in the price as is the case in many scottsdale chinese eateries.  We were in the area, we dropped by and fed our faces in an inexpensive,  clean,and friendly environment.  Nice people.

Pre-purchased tickets for a show and cannot use them because they do not answer their phones.  Called box office for the last 5 days and the automated voicemail says that they are helping other customers to please hold.  Then they disconnect you.  15 calls later and nothing.  This is NO WAY of doing business, especially for loyal patrons.  Disappointed.

Before I make my complaint about why I gave this place two stars,  I want to say that I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and it was one of the most delicious burgers I have had in a long time.  The bun seemed to be a brioche bun,  perfectly cooked beef as per my request with a nice char-y taste.  I did have to send it back to melt the cheese, but when it came back it was perfection to me.  The fries were not made well done as I asked but they were tasty fries.  They probably ignored that request because the place was filled with people attending the Phoenix Comicon.  Too busy to bother.  My chief complaint was the RUDE, ARROGANT, ALL-KNOWING, older, african american man tending to the bar (I was seated at the bar because I couldn't get a table.)  Made a face when I asked that the cheese on my burger go back for melting and then went on a rant after I started eating it.  So nasty and rude that I don't know how this bar could keep him employed.  I ignored him and ate. BTW,  when a customer asked for another napkin, he turned around and grabbed about 20 napkins, slapped them down on the counter next to the customer who had requested it, and said: "how's that?" The answer to  "how's that" should come from the owner of this establishment.  That generosity with the napkins, which was repeated by this bar person twice while I was there, does not fare well for the owner who is LOSING MONEY because he is giving away an unnecessary number napkins.  If he does that 100 times a month, go figure.  Businesses are won or lost by pennies at a time and not dollars.   I really didn't not appreciate this man's attitude so even though I totally enjoyed that burger, I will resist going there again.

Just got back from a Saturday night dinner at 43rd Express.  Made a long trip to get there but with these kinds of Yelp reviews, I couldn't help myself.  Place is a humble restaurant in that it is clean, but nothing to look at.  You know how I feel.  I don't eat decor; I eat food. Had the spring rolls as appetizers but instead of the shrimp, pork, etc I decided to have them made with just TOFU.  Three very large, fresh rolls that were really good.  Ordered the rare beef/brisket PHO which came in a large bowl with an ULTRA HUGE portion of the greens that you put in the soup--meaning basil leaves, cilantro, peppermint, jalapeños, lime slices and fresh bean sprouts.  Enough for two soups.   What a delicious broth!  Rare beef was indeed rare and delicate as it was sliced thin.  5 stars on the pho. Also had chicken fried rice which I was curious about--Vietnamese fried rice??? Hmmmm.......   Arrived with lots of veggies in it along with the chicken.  Good flavor.  Nicely prepared--not greasy.  Why is chinese fried rice so greasy sometimes?  Take note.   I ordered the half order of the crepe stuffed with shrimp and pork.  I think it's 38A on the menu.  Very good except I think it needed more salt.  I added soy sauce and it was fine.   This place has a dessert menu that includes Maccarons.... no, not Macaroons made of coconut.  Maccarons are small, light , flavored "cookies" which are a specialty of French bakeries.  Not surprising that a Vietnamese restaurant would carry these.  After all the French did occupy Vietnam thereby influencing its cuisine.  (e.g. the crepe).  I wanted to taste just one and chose the pistachio flavor.  It arrived a bluish-green color.  I expected the usual light green color.  I tasted it and while it was delicate (it is made of egg whites), it did not have any pistachio flavor.   Basically, they were nothing special.  But I think it may be unfair of me to assess these Macarons since I have eaten many, many of them in France where they masterfully create these bits of deliciousness.  Paris bakers are the king and queens of making macarons so I cannot expect a restaurant on 43rd Avenue in Phoenix to even begin to compete.  No need to. I came for great Vietnamese food and I got it.

Tried Da Vang on Saturday night because of all the great reviews and to treat an out of town guest to  Vietnamese cuisine.  I will start with the service.  3 people--3 entrees ordered.  The Pho came out 25 minutes after ordering,  the next dish came 25 minutes after the PHO and the third dish.....well..... we wondered about since it was NOT arriving.  We actually thought they had forgotten about the third dish. Embarrassingly, the third dish was for the out of town guest who wanted to try Vietnamese food.  So to sum it up, the service gets rounded up to  "zero" stars.  How can you serve 3 entrees in the course of an hour and 20 minutes to the same table and have each customer eating their food alone while the others watch?  It is called "dining"  not eating because the act is part of a larger social experience.  If I wanted to "eat" I would have bought a gyro and eaten it in my car.  So, definitely a big zero for service. Now for the food.  The chicken PHO was mediocre at best.  Hubby said that on a scale of 1-10, it was a 4.  He named 6 other vietnamese restaurants who do it better including the PHO place in the Gila River Casino in Chandler.  Really Da Vang?  You allow yourself to be beat out on PHO by a casino food court outfit?  Shame on you. Pho's should be your go-to dish!   Next: Stir fried noodles with pork & shrimp.  Way below par.  Had to add Siracha sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce to get any taste out of it.  And the pork  appeared to be scraps of pork (not pieces) cut lengthwise and very thin; and by the way Da Vang, thanks for the 3 small (and I mean small) shrimp you added to the dish.  Never, never, never, never, EVER---that's what my stomach is saying about me even thinking about ordering this dish EVER again.  Next: Sauteed beef with lemongrass over rice.  This was the definite winner of the three with a score of 5 out of ten.  The beef was not trimmed and fat prevailed.  Now, I know that fat is where it's at in terms of flavor but enough is enough.  Again, fish sauce and soy sauce had to be added to make it palatable.  AND FINALLY: The spring rolls ordered with Tofu instead of shrimp and pork were good and a good value.  Other than that... Not too much to be said for Da Vang.  Between the service and the less than stellar food,  I won't be there any time soon.....  Wait......wait....., wait a minute, I hear something.........  It's my stomach ....saying NO WAY JOSE....   I guess I won't  be going back ever again.  Stomach rules!!!!!!!!

This place deserves 6 Stars! Was in the neighborhood on business and dropped in.  The place is clean, service is prompt and the menu was very reasonably priced. We asked for two waters with lemon and they gave us two large glasses with a generous portion of lemons in the water.   Food portions are large--you won't be leaving here hungry.  Most importantly, the food is DEELISH!  Amazing food.  We had the lunch specials, $5.25 and $6.25 respectively.  The 6.25 dish was shrimp with lobster sauce and it  had 9 shrimp!  The fried rice that came with it had no meat in it but it was very tasty. The special also came with soup, an egg roll and a wonton. You can't beat that.  My companion had chicken with vegetables (5.25) which he requested very spicy and indeed he got it, very spicy. Most places you tell them spicy and they are afraid to do it.  Nicely Done!  Chicken was very tender.  I can't believe a restaurant this good is so far out there on the west side.  If it was closer to home I would be there every day!   If you live close by, you should really give them business. I would hate for a place like this to go out of business (although I was told the place has been there for a while)  I still have the egg rolls from the lunch in the fridge. Excuse me,  I think I will eat them now.

Lovely staff and A one service.  Always filling your waters.  Food was replenished often. The place was clean.   Now for the food.  First let me tell you that the price is $6.50 for all you can eat.  You would spend more at McDonald's or Burger King.   Limited variety but for $6.50 it was fine.  Selection was chow mein noodles, sweet and sour pork, BBQ chicken, veggie fried rice, Beef with broccoli (really broccoli with beef, LOL), pepper steak, egg rolls, orange chicken, lemon chicken,  egg fu young hockey pucks, wonton chips.   This is NOT gourmet Chinese food.  Gourmet chinese food would be $14.99 for one entree plus tax and tip.  So for you guys that knock the hell out of this place, think about that.   Dishes I liked:   Broccoli (garlicky and not over cooked)  chow mein noodles were not greasy veggie fried rice not greasy and fresh Beef and peppers  nice taste BBQ chicken  pretty good Wontons were not greasy.  Crispy. egg rolls were veggie and not greasy  Did not like Orange or lemon chicken because of the thick, thick crust.  If you don't mind a heavy crust, it's good.  We were hungry, saw the place (which does not look good from the outside because of dirty greenhouse windows) and took a chance.   Would not travel to get here again, but these are decent, honest working people serving up fresh food.

ODE to SUGAR BOWL  How do I love thee, let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth my ice-cream sundae can reach when feeling that it is almost out of sight, I love thee to the level of everyday's most quiet need as visions of your delicious ice-cream dance in my head, I love thee freely as I indulge as often as I can without hesitation, I love thee with smiles and tears for all my missed opportunities to eat your ice-cream at my very favorite place on earth.

I just called Footlocker at Camelback to find out if they had a particular shoe in a particular size.  I wanted to make sure they had it before I made the trip.  The phone rang 10 times before they picked up.  I asked the question to the young lady who picked up the phone and she said, just a minute.  I overheard a male voice telling her : Just tell them to call back in an hour.  The woman got back on the phone and repeated what the male said.   Really?   You have a customer on the phone clearly verifying a particular size because she is going to purchase it and ask THE CUSTOMER to call back?????????????????????   No wonder this place has all one star reviews.  Not calling back and not going to this location.  As a matter of fact, this just turned me off the Footlocker!!!!! No way, no how.  There are plenty of other stores.

I bought a coupon for this place BEFORE I checked the ratings.  Tried it on Friday because there is  "Flamenco" show.  At about 7:35PM, a guitarist takes his place on a chair and begins to strum.  Hmmm,  not bad I thought.  Then a woman with dancing shoes emerges wearing a frilly, nylon, pink dress which could have easily been a nightgown.  (not trying to be mean, just telling the truth).  She did two dances and during the rest of her time, she sat down and  clapped along while the guitarist played.   When I presented the coupon, the waiter told me that I had to order two entrees.  Having read from other Yelpers that they had been told the same, I quickly corrected the waiter and told him that the coupon said, $40 worth of FOOD not necessarily entrees.  They acquiesced. They served us hot rolls, no butter.  Instead, a garlicky ranch type dressing.  I put up with it.  cost saving measure I guess.  My friend ordered the Chicken Al Jerez, a chicken cutlet in sherry sauce.  He didn't want rice so he got vegetables.  On the menu in the restaurant, it doesn't specify that dishes come with soup or salad as it does on the internet.  I told the waiter and he added a salad. The chicken was overdone, but the taste of the sauce was good.  Mushrooms on the chicken were out of a can.  Salad was fresh  I had two appetizers.  Empanadas & Shrimp wrapped in bacon.  Empanadas should be meat filled turnovers.  Not here.  It was made with pizza dough stuffed with tomato sauce and slivers of chicken so small that I had to closely check it to be sure what it was.  I set it aside because it was not worth eating.  The waiter saw this and offered to get me another appetizer.  Nice guy.  Ordered Tortilla Espanola, a traditional fritata containing sliced potatoes, in its place.  It was good.  You can't hurt a frittata. Just dump stuff in the eggs and you're done.  I enjoyed the shrimp and bacon appetizer (I think Trader Joe's sells these frozen)  until I awoke last night with heartburn.  I remember eating them and thinking that the bacon was not totally crisped up (needed more time in the oven).  My fault for not telling them.   The saving grace of this evening was the server who waited on us and really tried to please us.  The one star is for him.  The owner who had greeted us initially at the door was busy setting tables with tablecloths (another cost-cutting measure?) instead of checking in on his patrons.  I for one do not recommend this place to anyone.

This was our first time at Village Tavern.  We were having a pre-mother's day dinner on Saturday to avoid the usual Sunday crowds. Village Tavern was selected based on Yelp reviews and what appeared to be a very diverse menu.   We started off with a Guiness and a Fonseca Port Wine which was delicious.  A little pricey at $10.50 for about 4 oz of Port.  I enjoyed it though.  I ordered the French onion soup which was a little on the salty side but I love salt so I ate every last drop of it.  I selected a crab cake (appetizer) which came with tartar sauce along with an order of  french fries, The crab cakes were amazing.  Real crab meat almost no breading.  Excellent.   Hubby had the trout which was a really nice portion of filets with a teriyaki type glaze. He selected the sweet potato fries which had a hint of cinnamon and possibly a light sprinkling of sugar.  He really, really enjoyed his meal.  The true test of whether he likes a dish is to ask if he would order it again.  His answer was absolutely!   We topped off the dinner with apple cobbler with a scoop of Hagaan Daz.  We held off on the caramel sauce because we thought it would make it too sweet- and we were right.  The cobbler was really delicious and large enough that two of us couldn't finish it. This review would not be complete without commenting on the service.  Jared was our server and he was very informative and attentive.  Thanks to Jared now I know that seafood is flown in every day to Village Tavern.  That means I will go to Village Tavern for my seafood dishes.  Our waters were filled and he checked on us often.   Thanks Jared. And thanks   to Village Tavern for running such a great kitchen and a smooth operation.

What could be better than dinner at Ruth's Chris on a weekday? Certainly breaks up the week with a special treat.  So let me tell you about my treat.  For starters, they brought us a basket with delicious bread (at least I thought so).   Warm, crusty on the outside,, soft on the inside and with soft butter they provided, it was comfort food at its best.  The bread was darker than usual so i believe it was a multigrain of sorts with kind of a "sourdougy" flavor.  I couldn't stop eating it.  It reminded me of that great bread that you get in the ARTHUR AVENUE section of the Bronx (Little Italy in the Bronx they call it) .  Amazing bread.  Some places sell it in Scottsdale and it says: "Arthur Avenue Bread" on the wrapping so look out for it and buy it if you see it.  You won't be sorry. Our orders were filet mignon and stuffed chicken.  Who orders stuffed chicken at a steakhouse?  A person who was not in the mood for beef, that's who. (that would be me)  The filet mignon arrived super rare, just the way he likes it and my chicken  was piping hot with a slightly brown top & salt and pepper topping.  I usually like my chicken browned more but, who knew, I might like it.  (See how flexible I am? )  However, I thought about how strange the "chicken" looked.  The breast of the chicken seemed huge in contrast to the smallish drumsticks.  I felt I was looking at a size zero woman with triple D implants---kind of odd looking.  It seemed like a small bird for a chicken. Was I about to eat a capon, a cornish hen, or a pigeon?  The French love pigeon you know. And there are poultry markets in Phoenix that sell them so was I about to eat one? I cut across the breast to get a sliver of the top of the breast with its mix of salt and pepper.  Found the chicken to be moist but nothing special flavor-wise.--AT ALL.  And where was the "stuffing" after all it was stuffed chicken?  I cut in deeper to find an orange -looking unmelted cheese spread.  Not flavorful and kind of strange tasting.  If it's yellow, it must be cheddar, right?  But it was not sharp enough to be cheddar.  A hybrid perhaps of some chef in the making?  I would have been happy with Boursin or even Cheez-Wiz in the center. No, not my favorite so far.  Hubby noticed my dissatisfaction and let me taste his filet mignon.  My God, it was meat from the heavenly Gods---prepared perfectly.  (Am I allowed to use the word G-d twice in one sentence?  I don't mean to be blasphemous!) The taste was absolutely, deliciously, unbelievable and TENDER, TENDER, TENDER.  So when I told him how I felt about my chicken dish, he asked:  Who orders chicken in a steakhouse _____?   You fill in the blank.  What was I to say?  He was right.   The mashed potatoes and broccoli were fine.  Somehow the mashed potatoes were not over the top although they had sufficient butter in them.  I tried salting them, but that still did not make them stellar.  Hubby didn't bother eating the potatoes.  I guess to most, those would be great mashed potatoes but butter alone does not make them great.  (unfortunately I will not be sharing  my mashed potato secrets with Ruth's Chris.  They have to figure it out for themselves.  The broccoli was good, cooked al dente just the way we like it.  BTW,  we both had salads which were fresh and consisted of a variety of greens with a balsamic type dressing.   Back to my chicken.  After eating a few bites of these large DDD breasts,  I decided not to waste my calories on it.  I would use those up on dessert.  We both decided  to order their Whiskey Bread Pudding and what a good decision that was.  Amazingly delicious bread pudding with raisins and tiny pieces of fruit in them--flavorful and moist.  It was sitting on an egg-nog/whiskey flavored yellow sauce that complemented the bread pudding wonderfully.  Now I make bread pudding and I would say that their's was 9.9   and mine is 9.5. I think theirs was better than the one I make.  Maybe it was the whiskey element.  Hubby disagreed.  He says mine was a 10 and theirs was a 9.5.  Clever man.  He know what to say so those meals can continue coming his way.    So here is my rating:  One star for service (service here is always good), one star for that amazing dessert, and two stars for that filet mignon delivered from heaven above.  I had to take one star off for THAT CHICKEN.   Please ruth's chris, rethink that stuffing and the flavoring on that chicken.  It just doesn't meet your usual standards.   Lesson learned:  Next time I go to a steakhouse, I shall order a steak so hubby doesn't call me ______________.

Lovely setting as usual.  We were given a booth that could have accommodated more people so they were very nice.  Here's the rundown. Delicious crusty bread with butter.  We had seconds (it was so good).  Spicy Bloody Mary with plenty of horseradish-- good drink with enough alcohol.  Sometimes drinks don't have enough alcohol at certain establishments, but this one was great.    We had the mozzarella and kumato tomato appetizer with basil and balsamic drizzle.  I looked forward to kumato tomatoes because they are truly delicious.  This appetizer did not live up to our expectations.  The mozzarella was not that good (cut up in cubes)  and the kumato tomatoes were nothing special.  We were very disappointed and would not order this again.    The sea bass we ordered was perfection.  A thick, flaky piece of fish sitting on minute pieces of sweet potato and pineapple.  When we saw sweet potato on the menu with the sea bass, we assumed we would not have to order a side.  But there wasn't enough sweet potato so we should have ordered one side- maybe a veggie.    The Barbecue Shrimp came with 10 medium sized shrimp.  This dish was described as having garlic mashed potatoes.  This dish was mostly shrimp and sauce and the mashed potatoes was almost nonexistent.  Keep in mind that I have had this dish many times before and it had enough mashed potatoes to mix nicely with the delicious sauce.  Not this one.  I should have said something but didn't.    For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse combo-- a chocolate lava cake along with a mini-cup of chocolate mousse. The lava cake was very good but the chocolate mousse was NOT.  The mousse was not dark enough--as if the mousse was made with milk chocolate (not dark, bitter chocolate) or that is was cut with whipped cream. The taste was not good.  We like our chocolate mousse dark and rich and this was not it.    Our service with BEN was attentive and the manager came by twice to make sure everything was good.  I like the service at Ruth Chris as they make you feel special.    Despite 3 disappointments during this meal, I still think they warrant 4 stars for service and the food that was enjoyed.

I tried Jade Palace at Scottsdale Road after we didn't like the one of Shea Blvd.  My husband really disliked that one and I convinced him to give this location a try.  It was rated higher on Yelp than the Shea location.   I had the shrimp with lobster sauce and chicken fried rice.  The rice was very tasty with an ample amount of chicken.   The lobster sauce had pork in it which is NY style.  Really delicious.  10 large shrimp cooked perfectly.   Hubby's Orange chicken was not over crusted (that's the usual problem with this dish) but there were no "orange" flavors.  The only thing that connected this dish to "orange"  was the garnish of one half slice of orange on the plate.  There was a dark brown sauce that tasted nothing like orange.  It was spiced up enough just as he requested, however, he would not order this dish again.   The servers were attentive and the management came by to ask how everything was. Now, I may be getting cheap in my old age, but I think $46.00 for two entrees and one small dish of fried rice is a bit much.  I like the location and the ambience of the place but I feel the prices are a bit high.  Perhaps I will try them for lunch if they have lunch specials.  My dish was really good  but I don't think hubby will be coming back any time soon.  That's 2 for 2.

Went to this Cox store for a new remote and waited about 5 minutes before Brian (a technician who was helping out for the day with incoming customers) gave us a new remote and explained how to program it.  Thanks Brian.  Good service, Cox.  Good change from the usual wait.

I can't get over the fact that I paid $18.77 for a medium deep dish pizza.  Medium--enough for two of us if I can control the other eater.  Asked for pepperoni and sausage.  Check the picture to see if you see sausage. Put on your glasses AND your contacts.   I only agreed to pay for this ridiculous amount because my granddaughter wanted it and you know how that goes.  As you see a day later, I just had to Yelp about this atrocity.  And now I will tell you what added insult to injury.  I asked for red pepper flakes and the guy behind the counter told me I could buy a small shaker of red pepper flakes from them.  Really?  I laid out $$$$$$$$$18.77 for a MEDIUM pizza that had virtually no sausage in it and you want to charge me for red pepper flakes?????????  How much are the napkins, pray tell????  Update:  Saturday, August 8, 2015:  I was contacted by Domino's Customer Service and they   apologized and took care of the issue.  Thanks to Domino's for reaching out to its customers.

Ordered take out last night as I was in the mood for Moo shoo pork.  This place is close by so laziness prevailed.  I got the moo-shoo home and I was so hungry I just keep on eating.  I then realized that my whole mouth smelled of onion.  Very much so.  I have had moo-shoo pork in MANY, MANY restaurants.  It consists of a lot of cabbage, mushrooms and some onion.  BUT THIS WAS ONION, ONION, ONION.  I brushed my teeth twice before going to bed and in the morning I could still smell the onion on my breath.  I don't know what happened with this order, but I don't think the chef was on his game or understands what moo-shoo-pork is supposed to be.  This is a well known restaurant that is supposed to be good.  That's why the owner needs to know that chef on duty did not do a good job on this dish.

After over a year since my last visit, a friend suggested that we have lunch so I acquiesced to try this place again. They have a lunch buffet for a little over $8.00.  The egg drop soup tasted quite fresh.  Had some tofu in it and was not salty.  Light and flavorful.  They had a variety of dishes including chicken, fish, pork, shrimp, noodles, vegetables, white rice.  I was hoping that they had fried rice since I am not a fan of plain white rice.  My rule is not to eat out something I can make at home and white rice falls into that category.  They also had salad, onion rings, vegetable rolls and fried wonton.  For dessert they had almond cookies and fortune cookies were given with the tab.  Waters were kept full.  The lunch was enjoyable and reasonably priced.

What could be better than going to a restaurant that gives you a choice between Vietnamese & Chinese food?  Nothing wrong with choices!! Hubby tried the chicken pho and I a grilled pork chop atop pork fried rice.  The latter dish was the recommendation of the waiter (John) when I told him that I wanted pork but nothing with a sweet sauce.  The pho came with the usual accompaniments: basil, jalapeños, lemon, and bean sprouts.  Hubby had ask them NOT to put noodles in and John suggested they add veggies instead. (Don't you hate a man that watches his figure?)   He let me taste the broth and I thought it was incredibly delicious.  He thought the chicken was overcooked, but I reminded him that it was chicken breast and thinly sliced so the longer it's in the hot broth the more cooked it gets.  AND  what restaurant is going to chance serving barely cooked chicken? He cleaned his bowl and next time he wants to try the rare beef PHO.  My dish consisted of a very thin pork chop over a bed of fried rice--a real huge portion of rice.  The pork chop was not dry and had a char-like flavor.  The rice was NOT greasy and tasty.   We really like the customer service here as well as the food.  The pricing is very fair and we felt it was a good value for the money.  Come by sometime.

I promised myself I would not write this review.  But, I couldn't even keep this promise to myself.  My eating partner told me I owed the world this review considering that money is tight and people need to know what they are getting or not getting for their money. The staff was friendly upon our arrival and we were seated expeditiously.  Not too crowded for a Saturday night, hmmmmm.    My eating partner wanted to sit next to me instead of facing me so he began to move the placemat & silverware to the other side.  The waiter trying to be helpful, put all five of his fingers, on what was destined to be my plate, and swished the plate next to the other plate.  Helpful, but I was somewhat concerned about where those five fingers had been last.  i was soooo self disciplined that  didn't say a word, but I did use antibacterial hand cleaner on my plate.  With mersa and other types of infections abounding, I didn't want to take a chance.   Papdum came with coriander chutney.  Crispy and plentiful. The chicken biryani served to us had a strange color.  Very very red, as if cooked with tomato paste. Spicy as we asked but with no flavor.  Just heat.  We like the heat but the food has to be tasty.  (I thought of the delicious biryani that we could have had had we driven to our old stand-by that was further away from our house.)  What a difference a couple of miles makes.  Then the Chicken Vindaloo that was ordered spicy, was delivered spicy but with no flavor.  Indian spices were not strong enough; just chicken in a red sauce.  Even the tartness that vindaloo sauce requires was missing. Vindaloo is one of those sauces that contains a little bit of vinegar (just check any indian cookbook).  The tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce.    The people are nice enough but the food is probably one of the least favorite I have had in the valley (I was going to write worst, instead of least favorite but that would not be very nice).   Suffice it to say that my Saturday night dinner was less than tasty and certainly less than memorable.   Moral of the story:  Drive a few extra miles and go to a place where you know you will get excellent food at a fair price. It will be worth the drive. (Did you read this dear eating partner???)

I was questioning whether I should leave a review for a restaurant that has over 500 reviews averaging close to 5 stars.  But that super meal I had at Haji-Baba warrants a review.  Although a distance from my house, I wanted to give this place a try because of the legendary number of positive reviews.  Sure, they have a few unsatisfied customers but their reviews are mostly due to wait time for service.  They do get super crowded so frustration is to be expected.  Now for the REAL DEAL   Service was quick despite it being crowded on a Saturday night.  We were served by the twins---both handsome, both courteous and both efficient.   We had the lamb combination, a side order of Kibbe and the vegetarian platter.  They agreed to substitute hummus for the grape leaves which I haven't learned to love yet.  The lamb platter came with a skewer of wonderfully charred, generously thick chunks of expertly done lamb, a roasted tomato, lettuce and perfectly cooked basmati rice.  Looked amazing and was amazing. The kibbe was baked (sometimes they are fried), stuffed with beef and pine nuts.  Despite being baked, there was not a hint of dryness.  It had cinnamon in it which is not my preference but hubby thought it was delightful and took care of making it disappear.    The vegetable platter consisted of babaganoush, tabouli, falafel, hummus, yogurt and a salad.   I sprinkled it with Sumak to further enhance the flavors and it was really a delicious dish.  Both dishes were accompanied by plenty of arabic bread or pita.   Our food was truly enjoyable.  Nothing like a great meal that doesn't disappoint.

Saw this shack of a dilapidated-looking "house" and wondered what it was.  As I came closer, I saw what appeared to be outdoor tables with tree stumps as seating.  Went in and low and behold---a burger place.  Better yet, I could see some great looking burgers cooking on a fire grill. Even better yet, the wood fired grill uses mesquite wood!  We ordered two burgers with fries which were cooked perfectly (rare is hard to get as most restaurants are afraid to serve rare meat).  A condiments bar includes lettuce, tomato, jalapeños, pickles, sweet onions,as well as the usual toppings of mustard, ketchup, etc.  We topped our burgers and ate one of the most delicious burgers we have ever had.  The fries were perfectly fried (I asked for extra well done) and salted.  I can't tell you how great the burger was!   They are open 7 days a week which means... I will be there again soon.     BTW:  This is a CASH ONLY place.  Fine by me.

I don't know about the rest of their menu but I dropped by today and had the cheese sliders.  Although they took a while to cook (everything is done to order), they were really nicely cooked.  A little pink inside with mustard, ketchup and pickles already in them.  3 for $7.  The place where I used to buy sliders (initials TG) make them so thin that they are overcooked after one side is done.  These were amazingly juicy.  Two beers and the sliders and I was happy, happy, happy.  Thanks to the cook at Hideaway who was on duty on Sunday.

The menu at Spago'swas designed and executed by Wolfgang Puck's.  So what could go wrong?   NOTHING ABSOLUTELY, NOTHING!   Loved the place!!!!!!!! Spago is located inside Caesar Forum Shops among expensive shops and a beautiful environment with a Roman theme (Dah,  Caesar's Palace)   Has an external seating area which provides a great spot for people watching. (see photo)  We reserved a spot there and were promptly seated at 7.  Ordered a bloody Mary (spicy) which arrived in a tallish glass with olives and a pickled green bean.  When was the last time you had a pickled green bean with your bloody mary?  Tasted like a dill pickle only better. The stuffed olives were great too (not salty) and the spiciness of the drink did not disappoint.  (see photo)   We were then served the nirvana of nirvana's--Beautiful, crusty delicious bread with a ramekin of extra virgin olive oil.  Really good.  Would you be surprised if I told you we asked for a second helping of this deliciousness?  (see photo)  We split the Chinese chicken salad as an appetizer and when it arrived it was so big we thought the server had forgotten to split it.  AND THEN WE TASTED IT.  It was absolutely amazing with all types of cabbages (e.g.Napa, red cabbage), sugared cashews, moist chicken, sesame oil and other elements in the dressing. Don't know what makes it so delicious, but I could eat this salad every single day.  Hubby said it was the best salad he has ever had in a restaurant.  (see photo)  For entrees, we ordered the seabass on a bed of some veggies including chipolini onions.  We also had the spaghettini pasta, with a simple sauce of tomato, extra virgin olive oil, and basil strips.  (see photos)  The portions were good, prices were very fair, and the food was delicious.   No room for dessert though... I think all that bread had a bit to do with it but they did have very good choices on their dessert menu.    Service was provided by Karen who was super attentive without being overbearing.  When we left the staff said goodby and thanked us for coming.  They know how to do it at Spago's; it will be one of my go-to spots when in Vegas.

Visiting Vegas and wanted to try something different so we went to Cuba Cafe.  We had the sandwich Cubano, Media-Noche sandwich, an order of tostones, an order of moro rice, and the fried pork tapa which I requested with rice.    My dining companions had the sandwiches and while the sandwiches were good, they were not stellar.  Have had better sandwiches.  The moros rice was good, but an average good.  Tostones were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Very nice.  The garlic sauce that came with the tostones was not good. It was just the commercial store purchased chopped garlic which doesn't taste the same as fresh garlic. Not a smart way to cut costs. The tapas came with two small pieces of pork and the rice and beans. The two pieces of pork were enough for me but it was not as tasty as I expected it to be. This dish at $8.99 is a bit pricey.  I found the pricing in general to be a little high for the area and the ingredients of the dish.  Let's face it rice, beans and pork are relatively inexpensive. I don't think Cuba Cafe would be my choice again considering that Las Vegas has several other Cuban spots.

Was just there on Saturday night before a show at the Virginia Piper Theatre.  Had a brandy alexander that was probably the best I have ever had and plentiful too. I think they put Haggen Daz ice cream in it so what could be bad.  I tried their ceviche appetizer.  It was the best ceviche I have ever had in Arizona.  Very fresh and with the right amount of lime.  Could have used more cilantro  but you can't have everything.  My husband did NOT like the hamburger.  We specifically told the waitress before hand to make sure it was medium rare and NOT medium.  She wrote it down and sure enough the burger was well done.  Had to send it back and in 6 minutes we got another burger that was closer to a medium than medium rare.  Took it as it was since it is clear that when the place is packed they can't seem to get custom orders right. But they were nice enough about the situation and were gracious when we complained.  My husband commented to me that he was not enjoying the burger-- not tasty he said (as in one of the other joints we go to which shall remain nameless).   After I ate the ceviche, I asked to taste the burger meat since he said the burger wasn't very good.  The hamburger meat tasted to me like the burger I used to get growing up in the luncheonette where they used frozen hamburger patties cooked on a flat grill.  i could swear these are frozen hamburger patties, but I could be wrong.  Anyway, they need to do something about the burger meat.  The hamburger was accompanied with nicely crisp waffle fries and garnished with the pickle, fresh fruits & broccoli.  A very good value for the money. So AZ 88, could you work on your hamburger meat?  After all about one third of your menu is devoted to burgers.. just saying....   BTW, we are non smokers and two guys were standing  on the patio smoking (not eating or anything) no more than 3 feet from our table with their cigarette smoke wafting into our faces.  We asked the waitress and she said it was legal to smoke there. I said don't worry I'll ask them to move.  She said that she would go over to them and see what she could do.  The guys wouldn't budge and we had to make do until they finished their cigarettes while we inhaled the delicious essence of nicotine, formaldehyde and a number of other health endangering substances.  I am so glad I don't smoke but I get the opportunity to have my lungs compromised by two idiots who are going to end up on ventilators with me footing their healthcare bills.  Isn't America great?   In the meantime I am thinking about my next visit to get my now favorite ceviche and that banging Brandy Alexander!  That was an OMG moment.    (had to take one star off for the mediocre hamburger)

Dropped by AZ88 to get my favorite ceviche dish with a salad.   The waitress gave us the menus and served us water.  I noted that there were no straws for the water.  I will not drink out of glasses directly as a precaution.  (You never know if they have been washed properly in ANY restaurant regardless of price point) When we placed the order for our food,  I asked the waitress if she would she please bring us two straws.  When she did, she arrived with two straws without wrappers and placed them in our waters with her bare hands.  So we were expected to suck on these straws which now touched whatever else those bare hands touched prior to serving us??  We were appalled by this unsanitary service.  Can we safely assume that she practices  good hygiene  in all instances including after going to the bathroom.?  When she was informed of our concern, she told us that all the straws in AZ88 come without wrappers.  Who knows what other unhygienic practices go on.   This rating is for this unsanitary and unacceptable service.  Covered straws can't cost all that much.   Sorry AZ 88 but this needs to be said.

Went to Gabi's last Tuesday before leaving Las Vegas AND fellow Yelpers did not steer me wrong.  Excellent food and excellent service AND, AND AND... (very important for Vegas-on the Strip Restaurants... the prices were extremely fair for the quality of the food.  (Hey, Gabi management.... don't start raising prices cause I said this!!! )  All I am saying is that if you go to some of the dumpy restaurants in some of the hotels, you pay through the nose for food that belongs inside a septic tank before its time.  For example, there is a restaurant in the Rio that wants 28 for a chicken pot pie.. really Rio?  Had the steak au poivre, trout, and croque monsieur.  One of my guests who had the steak told me it was soooooo delicious that if she were home she would be licking the plate until it no longer needed washing... (a beautiful image). The guest who had the trout said it was the best trout he ever had... and the croque monsiuer was excellent but a little on the greasy side because of all the butter and cheese.  I think Gabi's can cut back a little on the butter since the delicious Gruyere cheese that it is made with provides most of the fat this sandwich needs.  I must share with you that I am a French Onion Soup aficionado.  I eat it here and in my favorite city in the whole wide world---Paris.  Well, I ordered the French Onion Soup at Gabi's and it looked amazingly beautiful-- a tall crock of soup with melted Gruyere cheese perfectly broiled on top resulting in gorgeous spots of darkened Gruyere--yum.  However, then I tasted it.  It was reeking with sugar.  Yes sugar.  So sweet I couldn't eat it.  When I beckoned the waiter to discuss it, he told me the onions caused the sweetness because they were sweet onions.  In response to the waiter's answer, I am going to put on the voice of an irate waiter in Paris. (now use your imagination and think of a balding, older gentleman who has been on his feet for at least 7 hours dealing with American tourists)  They go deep into their throats before saying : 'NOH! (that would be an American "No".)  I too say No to the theory that the onions caused the sweetness.  Do you know why?  Because I cook  that's why!  I believe that this soup has been Americanized to address the palettes of some americans (I said SOME so don't write back insulting me!).  They added sugar, lots of it AND because of the color of the soup,  I believe they added some Marsala wine which also provides some sweetness.  The ending of the French Onion Soup saga is that they graciously took it back.  They are a class act.  And did I forget about the service????   Amazing.  One of my guests had their water glass filled 7 times.  I'm not kidding.  AND, AND, And, did I forget to tell you about the Baguette????  Yes,  a complete baguette in a bakery bag--- delivered still warm from the oven presented with a generous portion of spreadable butter.  Yes spreadable --not those hard little bricks most restaurants serve.  And did I tell you we sat on the patio overlooking The Strip?  with misters to keep us cool???  Why did I leave thist to the end?.....  Because the food was the star of the show.   I am SOOOOOOO sorry that I went to Gabi's on my last day in Vegas.... if I had been there the first day, I would have chained my leg to one of the tables on the patio and eaten there every day breakfast, lunch and dinner... I would allow someone to take me to the bathroom every few hours only if they promise to give me back my table upon my return.  Otherwise, I'll skip the bathroom breaks.     Thanks Gabi management and staff for a wonderful experience and having a really great restaurant!

Was looking forward to an excellent meal at MON AMI GABI. We had reservations and they still tried to seat us in a part of the restaurant that was so sunny that u needed suntan lotion to sit there.  We refused that seating and the hostess was gracious enough to give us a table in a more appropriate part of the restaurant. We were provided with water, lovely crusty French bread and some orange colored  accompaniment made Of shredded carrots and champagne vinegar. It was not to our liking. But the bread and butter were divine. All tables had mini alcohol lamps but ours was not lit. ( after all romance was in the air). When hubby asked the server, SHARON V. for it to be lit her answer was :  wait a minute HUN.  HUN? HUN? Did u just call my husband HUN?  Most people call him doctor but you feel free to call him HUN?  Totally demeaning and disrespectful.  I get my steak au poivre and waited a few minutes before I was worthy of receiving a steak knife. There was only a butter knife on my table and for a minute I thought I would have to cut my steak with my butter knife. The steak was just ok this time and the trout dish was fine.  But we were so turned off at the events of the service that we didn't even have dessert.  MON AMI GABI was one of my favorite places in Vegas. I don't know what has happened but the service is not the same and the food is one step above average.  TOTO, we're not in KANSAS anymore.

I decided to go to dinner with hubby at Jade Palace (Shea) after only having used their take-out service once.  I wanted their shrimp with lobster sauce since they make it like it is made in NY, with minced pork.  This gives it a very nice flavor.  I am going to resist the temptation to give them one star which is what would happen if it were hubby doing this rating.  I am fairer than he is , I think.  He says fair is a four letter word and begins with F and therefore has no place in restaurant ratings.  Anyway, we went on a Saturday night and the place was well patronized.  We waited for a table and were seated in a small table for two (that's OK) with NO lighting (not OK).  Every table to our right, (bar was to our left) had spotlights above their tables so they could see what they were eating.  My husband objected and since I didn't have a flashlight with me to provide us with light, we asked to be moved.  People around our table were giggling because they realized how dark our area was and clearly there would be no way to see our food while we ate.  In retrospect, I wondered why they sat us there.  Didn't they realize this or perhaps they just didn't care?  Now... at a new table, lit enough that we could see our food, we ordered.  One egg drop soup for hubby and one wonton soup for me to start.  The egg drop soup had been touted as having a "rich broth" by Yelper so I expected him to be super happy with his soup.  He said it was OK.  I tasted it and it was OK and needed salt or something to give it flavor.  As is tradition, hubby took some of the crunchy noodles that accompanied the soups.  As he took them in hand, he commented to me how oily his hands had become from touching them.  With that, he said they were too greasy to eat.  I agreed. I flagged down the waiter and ask if he could give us a fresh batch of noodles which would be less oily.  The waiter nodded and return with more noodles.  Just as greasy and basically inedible.  Not a happy camper.  Loves those noodles with his soup, but couldn't have it.  As an appetizer I also had a NY style egg roll.  This meant that the egg roll had all kinds of meats.  It was a good size and average tasting--nothing special.   Hubby's dish was General Tso's chicken.  Hubby described it as nothing special.  My shrimp and lobster sauce was good.  We had both dishes with brown rice.   What hubby objected to was paying premium prices for average or below average tasting food.  I noted that because of Scottsdale rents and having a nice decor and tablecloths, etc the prices are higher.  His attitude is that he doesn't eat decor or tablecloths, he eats food... and you know, he is right. We paid close to $50 for two people without drinks for mediocre Chinese food.  I must take a lesson from hubby,  eat the food, not the decor.   The food DEFINITELY needs improvement so I don't understand what the fascination is with this restaurant. Perhaps the pickings are slim in Scottsdale........

This is no Morton's.  Don't even compare it.  This is a thousand times better than the Morton's in Scottsdale.  With that being said, I want to commend the staff firstly on truly outstanding service from beginning to end. They were polite, timely with the food and on point.  Our compliments to the chef.  We had the filets, which were cooked to perfection. However, the meat did not have the excellent taste that we expected.  We had mashed potatoes (very tasty) and green beans.  The salads were generous and fresh.  We had flourless chocolate cake which was amazing.  I can't find fault with this meal other than the fact that we didn't find the taste of the filets to be as flavorful  as this type of restaurant should offer.   My compliments to the wait staff who gave us such great service.

Another excellent meal at Capital Grille. Salad was fresh and delightful as well as plentiful.  Bread basket fresh and delish especially the pumpernickel raisin bread.   Kona Sirloin steak grilled perfectly.   Chicken Confit expertly done and most of all NOT overcooked which is easy to do with chicken. Accompanied by fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, and au jus.  Just yummy.  Mashed potatoes needed a little salt but tasted very good.  Haricot verts (as the french say) were thin and delicate and cooked "al dente" -- to the tooth.  Nothing worse than overcooked string beans, but these were perfect.   AND LAST but not least.... the chocolate flourless cake............nothing short of amazing..... The service was extraordinary as usual.....  The place is expensive but NOT overpriced.  The food and service is worth every nickel.   I hate reading reviews where people say it is overpriced.  If you feel you don't want to pay their prices then don't go .  But don't eat their delicious, well prepared food and then complain about pricing.  You saw the menu going in.  If you have a lousy meal then I understand those complaints but I haven't had a bad meal there yet.   Kudos to the staff who work so hard to make us  patrons enjoy our meal from start to finish.

Just had an amazing dinner at Eden Grill.  I have been there before but I am writing to tell you that this place just gets better and better and better!   I love the way the friendly servers greet, seat  and attend to you.  We started off with the Tabouli salad.  I am going to go out on a limb and tell you that this is one of the best (maybe even the best) Tabouli I have ever had hands down.  Fresh and well prepared served with pita bread.  A must try.  I ordered the Moroccan Chicken and it was wonderful--with just a hint of spiciness.  It came with beautiful, fluffy yellow rice with almonds.  Are you hungry yet?  You should be if you were imagining what this wonderful dish looked like.  Chicken with raisins, nuts, peppers onions... yum.   Hubby had Lamb Kabob salad --a generous portion of assorted salad greens, feta cheese and generous, generous portions of grilled lamb.  So good his eyes were twirling in his head.  (By the way,  this is the perfect choice for dinner during the summer months--what could be better than a salad and high quality grill meats???)   After hubby cleaned his plate,  he managed to steal a few bite-fulls of my Moroccan Chicken.  You see my portion was so large I couldn't finish it so he was hovering over my leftovers like a buzzard in the desert.  I quickly had it packed up before the vulture struck again.  (It's in the fridge now waiting to be my  lunch tomorrow)   We couldn't have dessert... not enough room.  But what I did have after dinner was a wonderful conversation with the owner, Nahren.  I wanted to tell her how much we enjoyed our dinner at Eden Grill and we talked about all the New Times Awards on her walls and her "A" rating from the health department which is proudly posted on the bar counter.  How many of the restaurants that you have been to lately have their health department ratings for all to see, just saying.   Well the food here is fresh, well prepared and delicious... what else can one say about a restaurant??? Well, you can say that the staff is amazing, especially the owner. See you soon, Eden Grill!

Dinner at Flemings on Tuesday night.  Hubby loves the Scottish Salmon and I didn't know what I was going to have since I don't eat fish. I finally decided on the Free Range Lemon Rosemary Brick Chicken in its juices with Spinach gnocchi.  We also had mashed potatoes and string beans.  Had  the salad which was nicely dressed for me and sans dressing for my disciplined man.   The Scottish salmon satisfied hubby along with the delicious string beans and they were indeed delicious.  The mashed potatoes were kind of average--don't know if they are from a mix or not since they did not taste like REAL mashed potatoes.  My chicken arrived like it had been trying to swim across Guantanamo bay and was still soaked from the trip.  What was supposed to be pan juices turned out to be about 2 and a half inches of broth--with white wine in it.  It almost covered both pieces of chicken (portion was more than adequate).  Floating in the broth were the gnocchi.  Tasted one and didn't like it then had hubby taste them to check my palate.  He neatly took his napkin and put it on his mouth and out went the gnocchi.  So I was not wrong.  Gnocchi are supposed to be pillows of delicious potato flour heaven in a  red sauce or any other liquid you want these babies to live in.  Not the case here.  I don't know how people eat them.  Or do they?  The chicken which had to be pulled "out of the Guantanamo waters" had little or no salt.  Ergo, little or no flavor.  Seasoning is everything and I know that the "chefs" at Flemings must know this.  Are they catering to the high blood pressure crowd of which I am not one?   I offered my dinner to hubby who despite his propensity to be able to "clean up a plate", decided he was not eating it after taking one taste of it.  So there you have it.  No dinner for me until I get home and have some Product 19 cereal with milk since I have no plans to start dinner.   The cereal was good and for those of you who have never tried Product 19 it really is good not to mention all the added vitamins and minerals.   Eating cereal was not what I intended when I went to dinner at Flemings.  You always expect high quality when you go to these steakhouses.  This one let me down.

Baiz is a large ethnic supermarket that provides an amazing array of food items including produce, butcher shop, canned goods and a small deli department.  Lots of middle eastern items, of course, but many, many items needed in anyone's pantry.  Bought French Feta cheese (love, love Feta) after choosing from several types (but only after first getting a taste of course!)  Bought 3 different kinds of olives at bargain prices ----chose from 10 types which were available.  Just had to get the basmati rice in a 10 pound bag since regular supermarkets charge so much per pound.  It was indeed a bargain.  Figs, dates, honey ---all reasonable priced.  And now here's the BONUS......... I had lunch with my granddaughter at the little counter in the front of the store.  Two delicious sandwiches for less than $10.--chicken schwarma and falafel.  Wow, were they great and fresh, fresh, fresh.   This ethnic market is not to be missed.

Let's start by saying that "Tradiciones" no longer exists and now the place is called "Mariscos Vuelve La Vida".   The Spanish translation to this phrase is "Seafood gives Life".   Ironically, this is what this restaurant is missing... life.  Made the mistake of taking some out of town relatives to eat here.  One in the party had been here before when it was Tradiciones and fell in love with the patio and the "Mexicaness" of it all.  Is Mexicaness a word?  I don't think so but I like it.   We ordered fried tilapia, fried red snapper, two chicken quesadillas, one carne asada platter, one chicken burrito, one Modelo Negro beer and one margarita.  All the dishes were accompanied by a fake yellow rice and refried beans.  These have to be addressed first.  I say fake yellow rice because they were trying to make the typical mexican rice but failed.  The rice was plain, saltless white rice with a few peas in it.  A mexican place that doesn't know how to make a flavorful yellow rice?? Shame, shame muchachos.  What a flavorless scoop of I don't know what!  Really?  I told the cook I would gladly come by free of charge and teach the cooks how to make really really good yellow rice but she just listened and then said she would tell the cook.   And now for the refried beans.  Mushy, flavorless, saltless something.  If I had had a blindfold I NEVER would have guess I was eating beans.  Beans can be soooo delicious made with tender loving care and seasoned properly with garlic, onions and yes...something called salt.   Then for the carne asada, AKA, shoe leather.  Thin slices of beef with NO salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter.  Telling the waitress that it was overcooked and tough when she asked how the food was did not help.  She just walked away.  Was she muttering "that's how we always make it" under her breath as she walked away?  The two fried fish dishes lacked salt, were overcooked and a tad greasy.  The quesadilla & burrito were passable but nothing  worth a return visit.  However, the MODELO NEGRO beer was EXCELLENT and that's how this restaurant earned its ONE star rating.   BTW, the chips were fresh and plentiful.  So if you want to go to a restaurant just for chips and water, you are good to go at this place. MARISCOS VUELVE LA VIDA, contrary to its name, will be on its last legs shortly. We should start calling the EMT's now and give it some mouth to mouth.  It is going to need it.

We were near Downtown Las Vegas and wanted to have dinner in a place where we were not going to be fed touristy food. We found TRIPLE GEORGE GRILL on Yelp and headed there to see if it fit the bill. Hubby wanted salmon and there it was right on the menu so we took a chance. Inside we found the place reminiscent of an old school steakhouse---lots of dark woods, linen covered tables  and enclosed private booths. We snagged one of those booths--lucky for us. Brenda our server brought us delicious sourdough bread with butter on a separate plate that had a pool of pink sauce around it. This sauce turned out to be an addictive, delicious dipping sauce for the bread. It was REALLY good. The Cajun salmon came with a rice pilaf that tasted like southern dirty rice as well as some sautéed veggies. The salmon portion was quite ample and deliciously prepared. My order was chicken pot pie and it was classically prepared with celery, peas, carrots potatoes and pearls onions amidst the chunks of chicken. Cream was used which made it deliciously rich. It came in what seem to be a cast iron mini pot which was topped by puff pastry. A delicious GUINNESS was the beverage of choice and even with that we made room for dessert --flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. KABOOM!  A Home run !  Our server was spot on making sure that all was well and that our waters were topped.  At the end of our meal, the owner came by to ask how our meal was and of course we expressed our delight with his restaurant.  When in Vegas, look this place up.  You won't be sorry.

Definitely old school, kind of dark, well run place.  We had the trout special (17) and crab cakes (19)-- came with a full salad bar with all the fixings--a really nice salad bar.  Crab cakes were good and trout as well.  We had choice of fries, mashed, baked potato, fries, etc.  We had the mashed with gravy and fries.  The fries were extra well done as we requested. By the way, if you are not a salad person you can have one of their soups. Friday was Broccoli cheese or New England Clam Chowder.  They also brought us some steaming hot bread: pumpernickel and rye.  I don't know where they get their bread but it was amazingly good.  Our water glasses were kept filled.  Server was an older gentleman who knew how to treat a customer.  We were too full for dessert but noted that they were reasonably priced.  We had a coupon which they took without hesitation or questions.  Before we left,  we sought out the owners (new,only there two months) to tell them how much we enjoyed our meal.  By the way, there were no screaming kids in the place--maybe because it's a bar/restaurant  (Thank goodness).  We'll be back!

I was all enthused after reading the great reviews on Yelp.  This place is run by a nice family and it is clean.  That being said,  this is not your top-notch chinese food.  If any Yelpers have been to NY or San Francisco, you know what amazing chinese food is. I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce which came with chicken because according to the waitress/owner, "we don't use msg so we use chicken for flavor". Good idea not to use msg but my shrimp dish should not have chicken in it because I didn't order a combo dish.  I also found chunks of whole garlic which I had to spit out.  Traditionally, shrimp with lobster sauce does not have ginger as a flavoring.  Lots of ginger which in most chinese dishes is great but not lobster sauce. My partner had orange chicken which consisted of large pieces chicken on a bed of duck sauce.  Did not see any evidence that orange peels were used as is traditional in this dish.  My partner thought the chicken had too much crust.  I tasted it and thought the  crust was fine.  Ordered pork potstickers (dumplings) and the dumpling dipping sauce was vinegary.  This is your average chinese place and I can't understand how in the world it could be Best of Phoenix?!  I am sorry I wasted the gas to get there.   Nice people, less than average food.   and service, well, there is one person for all the tables.

I've been to Canton Dragon before and stayed away because of a disagreement I had with a server a few years ago.  I won't go into the details but I still believe I was right. And when I feel I'm right I don't go back. But I decided to try them again last night for dinner hoping that I wouldn't run into the same server and that their food would make me glad I returned.  After tasting their food, I realized the only person I was punishing by not eating here was myself. Ordered a wonton soup which was Amazing, Amazing, Amazingly good.  Delicious broth, 2  pork wontons, large slice of chicken, bok choy.  I am telling you it is now the best Won ton soup I have ever eaten.  I had a cup but if I had order a bowl and an egg roll it would have been my full meal. So if you come to eat here, try the Won-ton soup.    It was happy hour (which goes to 8PM) so we ordered an appetizer; Lemongrass Tofu.  The tofu came fried in small cubes and while the lemongrass flavor was not prominent, there was a garlicky taste to it and a very, very, very subtle lemongrass flavor.  Lemongrass is expensive so I understand the strategy but if you are going to call it lemongrass anything it better have enough lemongrass to call it lemongrass. (Did you ever use the word lemongrass 4 times in one sentence???  I did)   Ordered Shrimp chow mein and orange chicken without breading.  Both came with Brown Rice- no up charge.  I like that.  Shrimp chow mein came with 9 glorious perfectly cooked shrimp, sautéed noodles and Al dente celery, water chestnuts, and onions.  It was a very enjoyable dish.  The orange chicken was all white meat with a sweet orange sauce.  Nicely prepared although not as spicy as my hubby would have liked.  Service was good especially since I didn't see the waitress who kept me away from the place to begin with.  In addition to the good food, I was able to use a coupon from The Clipper which reduced the final tab.  Good food, Good service and a good price at that.   Hope to be back soon.

Wow.  Here I go again.  I go and write a nice review and then I visit for lunch and am disappointed once again. Ordered shrimp with lobster sauce.  Lunch combo included "fried rice", egg roll and soup.   Hot and sour soup was just ok.  Fried rice is a misnomer.  When I think of fried rice I think of chucks of meat, peas, egg, bean sprouts, you know....  This was white rice with a drop of soy sauce and a slivers of egg (if you have a magnifying glass).  Canton Dragon, Please don't call it fried rice.  Do yourself a favor and just say your combos come with white rice.  Egg roll was tasty and not too greasy.  The shrimp with lobster sauce was almost inedible.  It is not the shrimp and lobster sauce you get at other restaurants --it is totally different and in this case different is not good.  Included corn kernels, a tiny bit of bok choy, which are never part of shrimp of lobster sauce.  There was a blandness about it that made me leave the dish practically untouched.   My granddaughter's beef and broccoli satisfied her yen for beef and it was quite generous and hence the two stars.   Don't think I will be giving this place another shot.

Was wanting to try the DIM SUM here.  I picked Mother's Day to do it so the large crowd of people waiting to get in should not have surprised me.  They were mostly asian families so that gave me a clue that I was in a good place.  Expected a 30 minute wait and it was about 40.  Yet, I was surprised that it was not an hour considering all those people waiting outside their doors.   I was surprised  that they have white tablecloths too.  It's kind of a big place and it's got to be an expense but they do it despite the fact that they are not a high end restaurant. I liked that.  Now to the food.  We ordered from the Dim sum as well as the regular menus.    DIM SUM:   Chinese broccoli:  A large portion of fresh, sautéed, al dente & delicious broccoli. Better than the broccoli sold in the  regular supermarket.  The stalks reminded me of Asparaus stalks.   5 stars  Fried Tofu:    4 large, greaseless chunks with a side sweet sauce   5 stars Chicken Feet:  (Yeah baby, chicken feet) 6 tender,  gelatinous, yummy feet in a great sauce  5 stars Shanghai Dumplings:  4 smallish pork-filled, broth-filled dumplings.  5 stars.  Off the regular menu, hubby ordered sautéed chicken in an orange sauce and requested that the chicken not be breaded. The large portion of chicken was amazingly tender with a really delicious sauce.  5 stars.   Did I tell you they give you free hot tea?  Yes they do and the tea is the real deal made with loose tea leaves.  Nice touch. Service was really amazing considering the crowds at this place today.  The young man was extremely patient with us explaining the DIM SUM options and orchestrating hubby's breadcrumb-free chicken.   The only negative was the checkout. You have to bring the check to the cashier in the front and there was quite a line to pay your bill.  I am not penalizing them for this as it was my idea to come on a major holiday.  Duh..... This was my first time here but it won't be my last! (check out all 5 photos!)

Dropped by today checking on various electronic items.  Amazing how much I learned from the staff in the electronics department.  They know their stuff and are able to guide you before making your purchase.   On the food side, they can't be beat.  Fresh. rotisserie chickens, not to mention those wonderful samples they give you.  Today I ended buying one of their sample items, it was soooooo good.   I appreciate having a store like this so close to home.  BTW, I  went to their competitor  to comparison shop and I noticed that while Costco was full of customers, the "other one" was not.  I also found that the "other one" has higher prices on electronics FOR THE SAME ITEM.   Just saying.

Found them on Yelp.  They picked up an area rug.  He promised it would look like new. He complimented me on the abstract design on the rug.  Yes, it' beautiful but I bet he says that to everyone!  LOL.   Rug came back looking super clean and beautiful.  Hubby thinks they were expensive.  I think you get what you pay for.  They did a nice job.

Decided to try this restaurant so close to home where we had never eaten before.  Why is it that we feel we have to travel far away from our homes to get good food???  First impressions are everything.  Small, attractive  restaurant with tables that are nicely laid out and dressed with white table cloths.  Other reviewers have complained that the tables are too close.  Well, it is possible that you could be seated with another table close to you, but who cares.... it's only dinner.  While making my reservation, I was told I could get a patio table but I turned it down because I thought I would be eating on some metallic patio table which didn't seem appealing to me.  But I was wrong!  Even the patio tables are perfectly dressed in white table cloths.  Next time... next time.... (especially since the evening weather was so delicious). Now to the food.  We were immediately served fresh bread with a mini-carafe of dark green extra virgin olive oil---the good stuff.  The bread was delicious and with the olive oil to dunk it in---amazing.  We ordered the chicken piccata with pasta/tomato sauce AND chicken marsala with string beans.  The piccata was perfectly cooked.  I was tempted to add a little salt because I am a salt-a-holic but I resisted.  The pasta was perfectly cooked with a sauce that can best be described as a "fresh tomato sauce" meaning that it was lighter than most and had been clearly made from chopped tomatoes.  Light but delish.  The chicken marsala had a wonderful sweet (but not too sweet) marsala sauce with mushrooms. Really, really good.  The string beans were sautéed in olive oil with a hint of garlic.  Really nicely prepared.  Hubby would have liked it with more garlic, but then again he's Dracula and needs garlic to keep him in line.  We once again asked for more bread and in a second there was more bread.   We couldn't fit dessert in.  I don't believe in forcing dessert especially if it a really good and then you are not really enjoying it.  Maybe next time we can share something.   We had the opportunity of meeting Filomena (the owner?) and she was amazingly sweet and attentive.  We asked her where they got their bread from to which she answered that they MAKE THEIR OWN BREAD!!!!  What?????  Who does that anymore?  That's why the bread is so good, they make it with tender loving care.  Very smart of them--quality control by baking their own bread.  I have been to italian restaurants where they don't even serve you bread or breads from bakeries that are stale by the time the day is over.  I told Filomena that I was dying to try the tripe appetizer but that hubby doesn't eat tripe.  She said she could make an entree out of it by doubling the portion.   I'm IN!   Next time it's tripe for me.  Love it as much as loved Tesoro Restaurant and the charming Filomena.  Thank you for a great meal.  As Arnold Schwartnegger said:  I'll be ba-ack!    Post script:  Some yelpers complained about the prices.  Dishes are about 17-21 dollars... So I don't know where the complaints are coming from.  Most italian restaurants charge about that or upwards of it.  Thought that it needed to be said.  That's it folks.

It so hurts me to write this review.  This restaurant is family owned and are the nicest people you ever want to meet.  I had been away for a few months and upon return decided to go to one of my favorites--Saigon Nites.  You don't understand how I felt about this restaurant. It was on my cell's speed dial! At dinner I ordered chicken PHO. As other Yelpers had complained, yes indeed, there was almost no chicken in the PHO.  There was an indication on the menu that you can pay extra for extra meat-- that should have been a clue as I never saw this before.  So if you add the surcharge for extra meat we are talking about $10 for PHO?  As I was sharing  the PHO with someone, I found myself having to remind the waiter that I needed two small bowls. An oversight?  In the past, it was done as a matter of course.   We told our waiter that  we wanted our food spicy.  "How spicy?" he asked. We said very spicy. 9 out of 10. Clearly, we like our food spicy.  We ordered Shaken Beef and Lemongrass Chicken.  When these two dishes arrived at our table, they were covered (and I mean COVERED) with red pepper flakes.  Yes, red pepper flakes like the ones you find in a pizzeria to put on your pizza.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  I called the waiter over and told him I had never seen something like this.  I said usually there are Thai peppers or other spicy peppers infused into the dish to render the dish spicy.  He told me that's what they do it now.  I also asked about the Lemongrass in the Lemongrass chicken.  No lemongrass  to be found.  The waiter told me it was there inside the dish.  I should have brought my magnifying glass.  I had eaten the dish before at Saigon Nites and there were shoots of Lemongrass evident in the dish.  In addition, in both dishes the meats were overcooked and dry. We made no further comments, ate the food and left.  How disappointing that one of our favorite restaurants has died.   I truly understand that in this economy that have to cut down on expenses, but cutting down on chicken in the PHO?  I can buy chicken for 79cents a pound and I imagine that they can get a better price.  Lemongrass is expensive, but if it's that pricey you are better off taking it off the menu that disappointing your clients.   I hope that the owners read this review, take heed and make some changes so that some of us who loved the restaurant so much in the past can return.

One star is too much.  Old fashioned, smoky environment with disinterested casino staff.  Have not won anything here.  Slots are tight and the tables are unwelcoming due to rude and disinterested dealers.  Your clothes will smell like pure smoke when you get home.  Food is low quality.  Go somewhere else.

Just got back from eating at Asian Cafe Express.  I went there strictly based on Yelp reviews.  Here is my assessment: Portions=5 stars Pricing=5 stars Service/friendliness=4 stars Food taste= 2 Based on the above, they deserve 4 stars all things being equal. But things are NOT equal.  The taste of the food is what should drive the rating of a restaurant assuming that they don't throw the food at you or spit in your soup.  Other than that , it is taste, taste ,taste.   I was not impressed with the taste of the food.  I have been to NYC Chinatown restaurants, San Francisco's Chinatown, LA's Chinatown, even Paris' Chinatown so I know what good chinese food is.  This is not it.   People's judgement gets clouded by a low price and then suddenly everything tastes great.  You will note that most of the reviews make reference to their low prices and maybe that's why that have all those Best of Phoenix ratings.  People rate restaurants not only on taste but overwhelmingly based upon getting a good bang for the dollar.  This is a case where the bang for the buck reigned supreme.  AND... by the way, they said their toilets were not working.  Isn't it illegal to operate a restaurant without have toilets working properly considering that the restaurant has a capacity of at least 90 people?  Where does the staff go pi-pi?  Just asking....  Anyway,  Food is rated a two and this geeser isn't spending gas to save a few nickels on food.  I would rather pay more for half the portion and feel that I have had a DELICIOUS and DELECTABLE meal.  My husband on the other hand................

As many Yelpers have already said, this is a good store.  Things are easy to find and the prices are great.  The problem that I have encountered is that when they run out of an item and the truck is due to arrive on a Wednesday, it is rare that everything is on the shelves by even Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  I usually have to wait a week until it is available to the customers again.  Other than that, the prices are great especially the discounted food items.  The staff has always been helpful and friendly.  Really good store.

The food was excellent, fresh, plentiful and inexpensive.  The server was helpful as he thought we had never had middle eastern food.  We let him make suggestions anyway since he was trying to be sooooo helpful. We had the chicken kabob sandwich with tabouli salad.  My friend had the gyro sandwich. Both were large and freshly made.  I think it's an amazing value so I don't know how a previous Yelper could say  that this is an expensive place.  The lamb dishes are well priced considering the cost of lamb meat and the size of the portions they serve.  As for the decor, this is clearly a former 5 and diner (50's decor)  but who cares.  As I frequently say in my reviews:  I don't eat decor, walls or tablecloths--Just the food!  Enjoy this restaurant.  Go there soon

Went there specifically for the lamb kabobs that my hubby adores.  Out of lamb, you say? A middle-eastern restaurant called Flaming Kabobs out of lamb?  Out of lamb you say?  Am I to believe that I drove.... miles (I don't want to say how far I drove to get hubby's lamb!)  and you DON'T have lamb?  Yes. I understand now.  You DON"T have lamb!   Hubby had to choose beef kabobs (which I could make at home).  Asked for them bloody-----not rare---bloody!  Plentiful kabob dish came out and when he cut into them they were medium, only one or two pieces were rare.  That's two disappointments in one evening.  Hubby, kept silent (he is the strong, silent type) and ate.  He made the best of his over-cooked kabobs, but then again most people eat them medium or medium rare so the cooks were not skilled in preparing kabobs according to HIS palate.  He had a very good salad with it,  some pretty good rice (although I think it is converted rice and not real rice) and plenty of warm pita.  I ordered a small vegetarian appetizer that was delicious and they gave me more than enough pita to clean my plate of the vegetarian delights.   So all in all they had two strikes against them--no lamb and overcooked beef kabobs (I will ignore the converted/minute rice).  That means that I have to deduct two stars from 5 leaving 3.  But as you can see, I gave them 4 stars-- one additional star for the lovely young lady who waited on us. Could you please buy some lamb for your customers?  Thank you.

Ended up at Litchfield Park after a business meeting.  Hungry so I pulled into the Basha's parking lot because I saw Tasty Asian Kitchen.  Chinese food?  Yeah I can do that-- I love good chinese food. The operative word is good.  Ordered lunch special of Egg Foo Young that came with egg fried rice, egg roll and soup.  The soup came out in a small bowl that could have accompanied a toddler's tea set.  There were 5 tablespoons of soup in the bowl--literally.  I said to myself:  What do you want, it's a lunch special?  Be nice.   The egg foo young was interesting.  I looked at it a few times until I could see where the egg foo young was.  The egg foo young consisted of two hockey pucks made with egg obviously. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Pork slices were on top of it with a brown sauce.  Ugh!  Then the egg fried rice.  Did someone say egg?  No egg--just a mound of sticky brown rice clearly created by adding soy sauce to overcooked clumped white rice.  Wow, what culinary prowess.  I can't tell you how bad the rice was.  None of it was eaten. The egg roll was fine.  Probably purchased frozen so all they had to do was fry it.  No wonder it was good.   Hubby had chicken with broccoli and it was mediocre at best.  The same egg fried rice in one, brown mound of clump.  None of it was eaten. I felt it was my duty to tell them that the rice was terrible.  They have to try to fix it right??  Silence would have made me an accomplice to the worst egg fried rice I have ever, ever, ever had.   If there were a minus star system, I would have rating them a minus one.  As it is, they get a one star for keeping their doors open and trying to contribute to our failing economy.

First time at Nick's Saturday night.  The place was packed but it was only 10 minutes before we were seated.  Ordered the chianti which was reasonable for $7.  The bread served in the basket consisted of various types--regular italian, foccacia, garlic knot?   All fresh.  The olive oil on the table which was infused with rosemary and roasted garlic was a nice accompaniment to the bread.  Ordered Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was served with linguini.  It was good, but disappointed that the portion consisted of only 5 shrimp.  6 would have been minimally more acceptable.  How do Chinese restaurants serve 10 shrimp for almost half the price? How do they do that?    Hubby had chicken with eggplant which was a special order.  He had it with vegetables--broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  The portion was very generous and the up charge for the special order was $2 over the chicken parmagiana price.  I thought that was fair.   Jeff was our server.  He answered the questions we had about the menu and was very attentive throughout our meal.   I will definitely try Nick's again maybe at lunch to check out their sandwiches.

Well, if you want VOLUME, this is the place for you.  Generous portions & very fair pricing. Lunch specials for about $5.65 and dinner specials for about $8 and up.  The dinner combo includes soup, egg roll, two fried shrimp, veggie fried rice and the entree of your choice.  I prefer less food but have tastier food.  Too much of bad is just bad, but a little bit of good is excellent.   Here's why my star allocation is the way it is: 1.  Egg drop soup which comes with the Dinner combination had very little taste.  It is about 4 ounces but considering it is free, some consumers would appreciate it.  I would rather have no soup than tasteless soup. 2.  The free fried shrimp which come with the dinner combo were 70% crust.  Shrimp not cleaned. Found a long string of poop when I opened it.  A bit oily too.  See photos.   3.  My House chow mein which came with Fried rice did not have much flavor. A few drops of sesame oil would have done the trick.  I added soy sauce to make it taste better.  If you see the photo, it looks delightful but it is a disappointment to the taste. 4.  Hubby LOVED his Orange chicken.  It was thinly sliced chicken and lightly crusted.  They should have followed suit on the shrimp and they would have been perfect.  Had brown rice with it for 50 cents extra.   5.  Egg roll was pretty good.  Lots of veggies and not too greasy until you get to the end of the egg roll but that is to be expected. Cordial service, clean place, very fair pricing.   If you want a lot of food for a cheap price, this is the place for you.

Just got back from Vegas and my experience at Hennessey's  Tavern was still on my mind.   I had eaten there 2 years ago and had a pretty decent meal so why not return right?  I also asked 4 friends who were visiting Vegas from NY to join me.  Good idea, right?  Not so much.   I arrived with my party of 3 and informed the wait staff  that another 4 people would be arriving shortly .  I told the "hostess" that I wanted to sit on the patio so I needed two tables set up with flatware to ensure that people arriving would not help themselves to our tables. They dismissively told me to just find two tables.  I waited, and waited and WAITED and no one came out to set up.  I got up again, went inside where servers were conglomerated  & happily chatting away. (There was ample staff considering that the place was nearly empty on a Monday night. )  A few minutes later, a female server with a brace on her hand put 7 sets of silverware on the table.  I asked her to bring out the menus so that we could browse them while we waited for the others to arrive.  We WAITED AND WAITED... no menus.  I asked a person in my party to go inside and ask for menus again.  My guest returned with the menus in hand and commented that the servers were just hanging out and chatting and could not understand why the menus had not been brought out.  I struggled with touching the menus  which were so sticky and dirty that I opened them by touching a teeny-tiny corner.  I immediately thought that if the menus were  this  dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  Couldn't those lingering servers wipe down the menus?  I've seen it done in restaurants all the time---but clearly not in this one!   After our party  of 4 arrived, we ordered our food and waited and waited and waited for our food to arrive. Each time we asked the server about the food, her answer was the same---It'll be right out!  .....Yeah, right.   Here are the highlights of our 7 orders:   Turkey burger & Fries, Bacon Burger & fries:  Fries so salty that they could not be eaten.  I tasted the fries and could not believe that this could be the work of a chef.  I dreaded the possibility that these fries had been salted by a prior customer and that they were recycled fries.  Ugh!!!   Everyone who had a burger said it was just OK, but definitely would not come back for one.  Fish & Chips:  A little steep at $15 but it included 3 filets of cod.  Fries were not cooked well done as I explicitly requested.  I mentioned it  to  the waitress and was told that she would have new fries for me -- this promise was accompanied by a doe-eyed apology.  This french fry saga would continue throughout the evening.   One of my guests asked for a beer before ordering dinner but she had almost finished her meal and still no beer.  Of course, the waitress apologized once again.  Apologies seemed to be the theme of the evening.    25 minutes later my well done fries had not arrived.  When I told my server I still didn't have my fries , she seems surprised & shocked by it.--"You didn't get your fries??"   So who else, pray tell, should have known if my fries had been brought out to my table???  So then she asks me if I want the re done fries to which I answered, Yes! Yes! I want fries with my fish filets!!   I don't get it.  I ordered fish & CHIIPS. CHIPS meaning french fries. So she says "OK, I'll be back in 5 minutes"  20 minutes later my party is ready to pay their bill and she shows up with my tab and NO FRIES.  She opted for giving us a discount on our tab rather than giving me the fries which I had been waiting all evening long.   And then, unbeknownst to me, the evening's entertainment was about to begin.  Wow,  a bonus.  Free entertainment.           Two drunks came flying out of the bar and land on the deck where we were seated.  Yelling, pummeling, more yelling, more pummeling.  Wait, wait, do I see my server who weighs about 80 pounds with a brace on her hand joining in on the pummeling?  How brave... how stupid!   She yelled at one of the drunks accusing him that he had thrown a drink at her.  So let me see, you over-serve drinks to your patrons  to make money and you are surprised by the results??  My guests were scrambling  to get out before the drunks included them in their MMA bout.  I for one was practically cowering in a corner like a scared rabbit.   So, nice going Hennessey's Tavern.  You managed to screw up what started as a perfectly good evening in Vegas.  The sad part is for the owner who will probably be out of business before you know it because the totally incompetent, lackadaisical servers and a kitchen gone wrong.

So great to step into Mel's Diner the location of the Mel's Diner TV show from the 70's (?)  Unfortunately the "Mel's" signage on the outside was not lit because it was day time, but I was wondering if it really worked at all.   Inside I found the place to be suffering from age but it was clean.  The menus had pictures of the cast and said, "Welcome to Mel's Diner".  You had me at Welcome.  We ordered a simple breakfast of scrambled eggs, with home fries and toast.  All freshly and perfectly prepared.  I ventured into the mushroom soup which was good.  Not the best I ever had, but good.  I looked around like a kid thinking about the show that I enjoyed for so many years.  I found out from the waitress that Wednesday's and Friday's they have an all you can eat fish fry made with Cod--my favorite fish for $9.99.  She said it really fills up.  I think I'll take her up on that. I enjoyed the nostalgia of it all---eating at the location of one of my favorite shows and getting good, reasonably priced food to boot. Kiss my Grits.

I am so sad to write this review.   My December review was a glowing one and since then I went back to try their all you can eat their fish and chips for $9.99  We tried the bargain meal and found it to be delightful.  Didn't bother to write it up because I had already given Mel's Diner a great review so why repeat myself?   We decided to have the fish and chips again.  Why not?  Delicious is delicious, right?   Well today not so much.  The fish was heavy and thick and we discovered why.  The crust was so thick it was an entity onto itself.  I mean rolls of thickness. This was NOT the case the last time we ate it.  I left my food but hubby decrusted all the fish, ate it and did not ask for any more.  This is highly unusual since this is an all you can eat promotion and he can put away quite a bit.  To give you an idea of the heaviness of the crust, please note the photo.  I have never experienced something like this before.  I even thought that the fish I tasted was not fully cooked on the inside because the crust was so thick it kept the fish from fully cooking.   The waitress was nice enough when we explained what was wrong with the fish but it is really not her fault.   Not returning.

Followed the high ratings given by Yelpers and drove out to Sahara Middle Eastern Restaurant---and I mean drove... (long story)   The place seemed nice enough, decorated with a middle eastern flavor without too much exaggeration.  Sat down at the booth in the back and had to put one of their decorative pillows to prop myself up from the sagging seating--uncomfortable to say the least.  Then we waited 10 minutes before anyone came to offer us menus or acknowledge that we were there.  Finally I decided to ask for menus-- gee what a surprise, customers need to see the menus.  We then had to ask for water because NONE was forthcoming without asking.  Maybe they are trying to save the environment, but don't most restaurants ask you what you are drinking?--NOT here.   So now we are set,  we have menus, but we also have questions.  So we ask the young lady in capri pants strutting herself around the restaurant (and especially around the owner)  about the preparation of one of the dishes.  BAD mistake (is there a good mistake????).  She said she didn't know much about the menu.  Aren't employees who interact with customers supposed to know about the menu???  Go to any McDonalds and ask what a BIG MAC is... I am sure they would know!!!!   I digress. The order was a chicken Shawarma sandwich,  Chicken Biryani, and a Vegetable Combo dish ( I think a #20).  Let's start with what I liked.  I thought the combo dish consisting of Hummus, Grape leaves, Falafel, Tabouleah, Babaganoush accompanied by pita was fine.  At $12.95 I don't know if it was fine.  It was a tad expensive compared to other combos at other places.  Regardless, I enjoyed it.  Hubby did not enjoy paying $12.95 for it.  The biggest disappointment was the Chicken Biryani.  It was well spiced but the chicken was overcooked.  When you cook white meat it becomes really stringy.  So all I heard on the way home was how overcooked his chicken was..(keep in mind that I had selected the restaurant).  The real surprise was that my 13 year old granddaughter who ADORES chicken shawarma and all things middle eastern did not enjoy her sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, she ate it.  But when I asked her about it she said, it was a sandwich she would NOT return for.  She then named 3 other middle eastern restaurants who make it better.   Disappointing.   I must say that the young lady  who brought us water made up for it by offering water almost to an annoying level.  Maybe it was her way to just strut those capri's in front of the owner.  Perhaps a dress code is overdue. Nobody wants to look at crotch.  Well, almost nobody.

So sad to report that my favorite indian place has declined to the point where I will NOT be returning.  This was my all time favorite place and my husband drove the 19 miles to get there because we could count on a good meal.  I think a good restaurant is worth the drive.  Unfortunately, I will not be returning.  Can any Yelper recommend a good indian restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale area?  I don't mind driving.

I don't get why this IHOP is getting such low ratings.  It is located in a nice area in Scottsdale and the place has been recently remodeled.  It is  a clean place to eat.   In addition, the waiters and waitresses are attentive and respectful.  They usually take your order in a timely manner---unless of course, you arrive on a Sunday morning right after church lets out.  On Sunday you will wait at least 20 minutes to get a table and about 5 to 6 minutes to get a server to your table.  Let's face it, he place is crowded because most people go out for Sunday breakfast.  That's as simple as that.  My experience here is that they serve good food at not so outrageous prices and you get really good deals if you are 55 or over.   So if you  don't want to wait, don't come here on a Sunday.  It's not fair to judge service on a Sunday. On an over 55 menu (which I partake of), you can get an amazing breakfast for about $8 out the door.  You can't beat that.  In addition, if you respond to the survey on your receipt, you will get a free drink next time.  That means a savings of $2.79 plus tax and tip (for coffee)  if you complete the survey and get the code.   I don't know what people look for when they go to IHOP.  It is not a foodie's haven.  It is a place to get breakfast items, basic American fare (cheeseburgers, fries, etc) and of late they have added more international items.  That's it.  Want a great steak? Go to Ruth's Chris or Flemings.  Want an amazing burger? Go to those burger places where they charge 12.95 for a plain burger plus fries.  I hold no stock in IHOP so my comments are based on my many experiences at this IHOP and hopefully to bring balance to some of the mediocre reviews.

Saw this place on Check Please Arizona and decided to try it.  As a former New Yorker I am always looking for great pizza which is quite scarce in Arizona (sorry).  I ordered the Salvatore which has tomatoes, mozzarella, proscuitto (crudo), parmagiano cheese and fresh arugula.  WHAT???  WHAT??? I am still asking myself this after having eaten a slice of this pizza.  WHAT??  Did I die and go to pizza heaven?  Am I in New York without knowing it?  Am I dreaming that I am in Italy eating this amazing, amazing, incredible, delicious, pizza???  WHAT is happening here????  WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PIZZA I EVER ATE... THAT'S WHAT!   So let's give 5 friggen' stars for the PIZZA.  Ba da boom!  Nicely charred crust and fresh ingredients.  OMG, let me not reminisce.  We had a glass a Chianti for $8 which was a bit on the vinegary side.  Two stars for that.  Hubby had the pollo al something.  Chicken breast with peppers, onions, olives over pasta.  Sounds good right?  He said it was just OK.  Two stars for the pollo dish. He might have had better luck with the chicken marsala.   I made the mistake of flipping out when I saw zeppoles on the dessert menu. They are a staple of NY Italian street festivals so I ordered them.  One taste and I knew this was fried pizza dough.  The saltiness of the dough and the lack of a soft doughnut-like texture was a giveaway.  These were hard and dry.  Not greasy though. Not good.  Take it off the menu or don't call them zeppoles.  0 stars for the "zeppoles".  So what are we up to?  5 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the wine, 2 stars for the chicken dish and "0" stars for the zeppole.  Let's do an average.  We have 9 divided by 4 equals 2.25.  But that doesn't capture the excellence of the pizza nor does it capture the excellence of the service provided by Karen.  So let's round it up to 4 stars---Thank you Karen and  you Mr. Pizza-maker whoever you are.  You made me a pizza that I will not soon forget.

Mastro's does not need me to write a review for them.  They are just EXCEPTIONAL period.   We went there on 9/27 for hubby's birthday. Drinks were a bloody mary and a Brandy Alexander.  He wanted his bloody mary spicy but upon arrival it lacked horseradish. Lauren, our server, quickly took it  and brought it back with ample horseradish.  He tasted it and said something was missing.  I volunteered that it was Tabasco.  After all, that is essential for a good bloody mary.  Lauren brought some Tabasco and after he added it, the Bloody Mary was perfect (I have to deduct one star for not getting birthday boy's drink right).  My brandy alexander was made with ice cream.  In the east they use cream, here ice cream. OMG.  Amazing drink.  Readers, you have to try it.   The assortment of breads was great.  Hubby only eats bread out because he is watching his girlish figure but this bread basket was his demise.  Ciabatta breads, olive bread, garlic flavored breads, pretzel breads.  Shall I go on like Forrest Gump?   His appetizer of smoked salmon was delicious although not as good as the smoked salmon they sell in Paris in a common supermarket.  (I don't know how the french do it.  Their food is so above the mark.)  Anyway, his smoked salmon came with capers, chopped red onion, baby cucumbers and many pieces of toast.  I was wondering if after all that he could eat his meal.  I ordered the french onion soup made with Gruyere cheese (that's the cheese it's supposed to have, not mozzarella or swiss) It came piping hot in what I thought a metal jar that was really too big for me.  The broth was not too salty as happens often.  I finished it off and I think the french onion soup finished me.   Now for the entrees:   I foolishly fed hubby some fine steak at home the night before we went (DAAAH...) so he was not up to steak.  He ordered a 16 oz veal chop and sweet potato fries.  I had ordered one crabcake from the appetizer section as my entree and it came accompanied by some micro-greens, a lemon, tartar sauce, all nice and fresh, but I couldn't touch any else since I had had that sinful brandy alexander, assorted breads and that delicious french onion soup. ( I had it the next morning and the crab cake was delicious: almost no breading and all crab! Micro-greens were slightly spicy and dressed in a very, very light dressing: wonderful)  By the way, the take-out containers are beautiful, black boxes that could be used to wrap the finest of gifts.  Just saying.  These people go all the way on quality.   Hubby ooo-ed and ahhhhed over his veal chop but he didn't believe it to be 16 0z as indicated on the menu.  I think that's the pre-cooked weight.  The sweet potato fries were not to be believed.  Firstly, the portion.  They were in a basket that was overflowing when they arrived at the table.  It could easily feed 5 people so if you are ordering them, remember that.  I am not a sweet potato fries fan but they looked so light and airy that I sampled them.  They were absolutely delicious.  Birthday boy was at his finest with all this good stuff around him.   When I thought that he couldn't enjoy himself more,  he ordered his birthday cake:  Chocolate Sin Cake.  It arrived on a creme anglais on the bottom of the plate with his name and happy birthday written in chocolate sauce, AND a separate bowl FULL of whipped cream.  I tasted the whipped cream and that was home-made stuff!  Yum.  The Chocolate Sin cake was slightly warm and hubby's eyes began to twirl in his head from the deliciousness of it all.  I am so glad I chose Mastro's City Hall for his birthday. Many thanks to our server, Lauren, and to the staff who made it all possible.

Yesterday I had the MOST amazing meal at Mastro's.   I had the most incredibly delicious, juicy, sumptuous double pork chop perfectly cooked--medium well and butterflied.   It was a sight to behold (I should have taken a picture of it to post for you) and the smell, well,  there should be such a thing as smell-a-vision.  I have never, ever, ever, ever had a more delicious pork chop.  EVER. ANYWHERE.   If you eat pork, don't even think of going to Mastro's and not trying the pork chop.  Oh, and did I forget to tell you about the accompanying dipping sauce with walnuts, apple and what tasted like bourbon?  A perfect match to the pork chop and really good.   Hubby had Chilean Sea Bass which he described as perfectly cooked and delicious. But my not being a fish eater I could not verify that.  I can verify that he cleaned his plate.  We had broccoli florets which tasted somewhat garlicky and hubby loved---I could take them or leave them.  I did notice that the broccoli had some yellow spots on them which should not be for a restaurant of this quality.  I also noted that the salad had tomatoes with the tops on them (the spot which attaches it to the vine was not removed).  This should not be either --Mastro's is too good for that.  We ended with the fudge cake which was good but not as good as the chocolate sin cake that we had before. But still, it was good.   We noted that Mastro's was packed on a Tuesday night.  I think this is a testament to people appreciating the quality of the food and of course, the service.    Thank you for an extraordinarily enjoyable meal.  I look forward to another great meal at Mastro's real soon.

We decided to sit in the main dining room since the last time we sat in the bar area (by the piano), we felt we didn't get the kind of attention that Mastro's usually offers.   We were given a table next to the glass that separates the dining room from the bar.  After about literally 30 seconds,  I could smell garbage/sewage.  Within the line of vision, we could see an open door and  inside a garbage can --so we assumed it was garbage smell.  We told our waitress who said she could change our table and she did.  We were told that it was not garbage --it was coming from  below( sewer).  My thoughts were that if they know the cause, why wasn't Mastro's more proactive in stifling the smell.  After being seated as far away from that table as possible, we noticed that a male manager was assessing the situation.  Five minutes later, a large, sizzling plate of garlic was paraded by a waiter all along the offensive area.  How clever!  Using garlic to mask the sewer smell.  Smart, smart, smart. And now for the good part of this review.....  Smoked Salmon Appetizer:  Excellent  (Good salmon with capers, onions, cucumbers and toast points) Bloody Mary:  Excellent Bread:  Just OK.  It wasn't the kind of bread you find in Paris where it is so delicious you gladly give up the main dish just to continue eating bread.  I don't know what it is about Parisian bread.... Must be the water. Warm Spinach Salad:  Just OK.  Bacon was overdone so it was bits of hardness.  Lardons are supposed to be rendered but left with enough fattiness that you can still taste the bacon as bacon and not a bacon hardness.  As much as I tried, it was not good enough to even eat half way. Veal Chop:  Cooked exactly as was requested.  Expertly done. Asparagus:  Nicely done with garlic and a touch of horseradish... Chocolate Sin cake:  Nothing could be better... with whipped cream.  Double YUM.   Thanks to our waitress who was right on point with service.

Early dinner before theatre in this pub which is inside a historic home.  Shared the delicious onion and leek soup. Amazing flavor.  I had the shepherd's pie which came with steamed veggies and a roll.  The beef in the pie was not ground beef but actual pieces of beef and veggies such as squash and parsnips.  It was topped with mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese.  Really good, really filling, couldn't finish it so now I have lunch for tomorrow.  Companion had corned beef sandwich & sauerkraut which was served on marble rye bread and a side of fries.  Sandwich was delicious but the fries were too oily.   They do something pretty novel for their customers.  They have a blackboard where they have a letter of the alphabet on it (besides the instructions).  If your last name begins with the letter, you get a draft beer or a well drink for 25 cents.  Is that the coolest or what?  (see photo)  I ended up with a 25 cent Guinness!  Thought  the food and service was very good.  I will be coming back!

Here I am again in search of delicious, NY style italian food.  I've been to at least 10 restaurants in Phx and Scottsdale.  Today I tried Pauly's (u never know, right?)   Pauly's surprised me.  The hallmark of a good italian restaurant is it's eggplant parmagiana and their marinara sauce.  So I ordered, guess what?  yup. the eggplant parm.  I waited a while so clearly they were making it fresh.  It came with ziti with marinara sauce and garlic knots.  I was unbelievably surprised by the eggplant.  It was very, very good.  The marinara sauce was good, not great. (NY standards are hard to beat) They sprinkled oregano on top of the sauce without asking me.  Oregano is good, but it can overwhelm.  The knots were delish.  I paid 9.99 for this dinner which was big  enough to take half home!  Unbelievably good buy for good food. Hubby asked for a chicken cutlet sandwish with eggplant on it and marinara  sauce.  Most places upcharge the added eggplant by about 3 bucks.  Here, 50 cents.  Wow.  These are decent people doing a great job with a restaurant/ (more of a take-out)  that serves people good food at an incredibly good price.  I'd go back.  Give it a shot.

Just had the second half of a meatball parmagiana hero that  I had last night. at Yo Pauly's  I feel I have to acknowledge that It was absolutely delicious.  Since my last review, I feel the taste of the sauce has improved to the point where it  can compete with some of the best New York sauces--really!   I totally enjoyed the sandwich--meatballs perfectly seasoned-not too firm and not too soft, amazing sauce and wonderfully toasted hero bread.  I can't compliment them enough.  Will be back real soon.

I came back for my meatball parm sandwich and this time bought an eating companion.  He ordered a hero with chicken and eggplant cutlets, no cheese  (Who orders no cheese, right???)  They gave us extra marinara sauce too.  He couldn't believe how delicious his sandwich was!  He is now a convert!   AND.... I got to sign Pauly's wall tile.....  I'm the one in blue ink from the Bronx.   See u soon.

Pauly's is still serving up delicious food.  Had the spaghetti & meatballs--great sauce, tasty meatballs with real meat not two pounds of bread crumbs. Very good.  Hubby had a hero with chicken, eggplant & marinara sauce--no cheese.  New waiter was a little confused with hubby's order. I guess most people don't combine eggplant and chicken--you should try it folks... it's good.   It was a nice size too.  Also, waiter kept on saying, "you want it on a roll?"... we kept saying- a wedge.  To me a roll is round and small--like the type you get when you order, let's say a tuna salad sandwich at a deli.  So then we said " A hero".   I think the waiter is new, but he has to learn the jargon.  Here it is:  hero, hoagie, wedge, sub... it's like an italian bread cut in half and split down the middle.  It is NOT a roll.   The guy was nice enough and as usual the food was delicious.  We ordered a Heinekin and got sticker shock at $5.50 for a bottle.  Am I behind the times or what?   $5.50 for a Heinekin?? I could understand it if it were a specialty beer which this is not.   Anyway, the food was so delish that we didn't say anything about the beer price.   Have to take one star away from the rating, though.....

To the owner:   Last Thursday you had a young man waiting tables who I had never seen before.  He was a bit pushy and overbearing, but I wanted to give him a chance thinking that perhaps the young man needs more to time to adapt to his new job.  This was my thinking until......... 1.  He brought us our dishes and we sat there without cutlery and napkins until we got our own by taking them off other tables.  I refused to do what my husband did and brought it to the attention of one of the waitresses.  She apologized and promptly gave me my cutlery and napkins.  2.  My waiter was stroking the back of his hair, rubbing his neck.... doing this with the hands that were soon to touch my food. 3.  My waiter was playing with his mouth and chin with his hands..... doing this with the hands that were soon to touch my food.  Do we see a pattern here??? 4.  When I asked for a take out container for my leftovers, he brought an aluminum pan and cover but made sure that his fingers were all inside the aluminum pan when he handed it to me.  I had to wipe it down with water and the scarce napkins.    Here is a clue waiters and waitress everywhere in YelpLand... DO NOT play with your body parts while you are on the job serving food to people who go out to eat for pleasure not to witness a science experiment on bacterial growth.    I was not going to Yelp about this, but the owner of Yo Pauly is a decent sort who runs a place with very good food and he needs to know what his wait staff is doing.   The food on this particular night was excellent as usual.  The service left much to be desired and the habits of this particular waiter touching himself before he served our food was disconcerting not to mention, a bit "nasty."

Wow.  Am I lucky!  I had a yen for spanokopita (spinach pie) and Yelpers led me to try Z's Greek.  I bit of a trip for us but we travel for good food (or what we think might be good food).  The place and the parking lot was not crowded for a Saturday evening (which I use as an indicator) but we took a chance.   AND we're glad we did!   BTW, there is no wait service.  You order and pay and then they bring out the food to your table.  The people at the counter were quick and delightful.   Had the Spanokopita platter which came with rice, red lemony potatoes, pita bread and a Greek salad.  I asked them to double up on the potatoes since I am not a fan of rice (don't report me to my latino ancestors).  Upon arrival, the platter was huge.  The greek salad with full of feta cheese with fresh lettuce tomatoes, green peppers and AN olive.  DELISH, DELISH, DELISH.  The pita bread was NOT the bag pita.  This was real, thick  greek pita bread.  The red potatoes were amazing--Not overcooked and lemony.  The Spanokopita (they gave me two pieces) was very good but to me it lacked salt.  I think more feta cheese in it would have made it perfect.  I TOTALLY enjoyed my meal and had left overs to take home.  Hubby had the Lamb Souvlakli platter which came with two skewers of grilled lamb with green peppers in between the chunks of meat.  He had the rice with the red potatoes, pita bread and greek salad.  WOW, WHAT A platter for under $11 considering the high price of lamb in the supermarket.  Nicely done too!  Hubby loved everything on his plate and his empty plate was evidence of that.  Desserts were $2.95.  Do YOU think we were leaving without dessert?  No way, Jose!  Ordered chocolate cake and tiramisu cake.  Both were really, really, really, really good---but I have to say that the chocolate cake was better than the tiramisu.  The chocolate cake was made of DARK, DARK, DARK, chocolate with chocolate shavings (dark) on the icing.  OMG... just thinking about it makes me want to drive back and get another one.   Hmmmmmm,  why didn't I bring an extra one home????????   I guess I can't think straight on a full stomach.   BTW, Z's Greek has many other things on the menu such as burgers and hot dogs-- so if you are eating out with your kids and want to have Greek food,  you can still have your Greek fix and give the kiddies what they like.   One more thing----the lack of cars in the parking lot was evidence of the fact that they do a brisk take out business. So my concern of not seeing cars was unfounded. I for one am going back again and again for my Greek fix.  I saw people ordering chicken souvlaki platter and it looked amazingly good.  Is is bad manners to check out other people's food when you have your own?  This is something Jerry Seinfeld might ponder about.  Not me.  I want to look and see what you are eating so I could eat it next time.  Enjoy Z's Greek.  I most certainly did!!!!!

Almost empty of patrons.  Quiet and desolate with many stores shut down.  Granddaughter did find cool stuff in some of the smaller stores there.   Food court had the usual fast food including pizza.  Would not pay $3.79 for a slice of pizza without any topping.  I realize that the rent must be high but that doesn't mean I have to pay for it.   Hopefully some developer will do something great to this place to make it a vibrant place where shopping will be more exciting.

Wow, what a terrific dinner we had!  We were served accompaniments of coriander chutney, tamarind sauce, and something I hadn't tasted before--spicy turnips.  We enjoyed those with the complimentary papadum.  We ordered Chicken vindaloo which was spicy as requested and delicious as well.  Complimentary yogurt sauce and white biryani rice came with the vindaloo.   Chicken Biryani was well prepared without the greasiness which usually accompanies this type of dish.  Tandoori roti bread was presented as requested (without butter) and yet it had a  good texture and taste.   We thought the food and service was worthy of 5 stars.  We were told by our waitress that the buffet operates 7 days a week and offers everything from bread to dessert.  We will definitely be back to enjoy more of their wonderful food.

Did a simple takeout since we decided to stay in New Year's Eve.  Ordered the Chicken Saag and Chicken Biryani.  I will be on the record to say that this is was the best Chicken Saag I have ever had in ANY restaurant where I have eaten Indian food.  That includes many East coast places known for great cuisine.  The Biryani was plentiful, delicious and had enough chicken.  Both dishes were made to the spiciness which we requested which was spicy.  Order came with a wonderful yogurt sauce.  The young lady who took the order was friendly and efficient.  She was very polite and wished me a happy new year..... Happy New Year Indian Paradise:  May the new year bring you lots of business from people who enjoy excellent, excellent , excellent Indian food.  Did I say excellent too many times????  Nope... not for this food!!!!

Been here many times but never reviewed it We all know Whole Foods.  Kinda of pricey but you get what you pay for. Love their cheeses and fresh fruits.  Nice meats too.  Bought plantains today as good ones are hard to get in other markets.  Their bakery items are great and not that expensive.  Bought a flour less chocolate cake but haven't eaten it yet.  But it looks mighty good!

I am shocked by these reviews.  Has anyone ever tasted their tasteless egg drop soup?  Has anyone ever tasted their mushy fried rice (of late) ?  Has anyone ever tasted their tasteless beef?   I am amazed by these reviews.  and this is NOT NY chinese food!   I don't know what it is.

I stopped by for take out.   Pork Fried Rice and Shrimp Egg Foo Young.   HANDS DOWN THE BEST PORK FRIED RICE I HAVE TASTED ANYWHERE.   Full of pork, sprinkled with bean sprouts, not greasy.  When I say amazing I mean amazing. Shrimp egg foo young was not greasy and super delicious. This place has come a long way since my bad review in 2012.   A good chef makes a difference.   WOW.   This is as good as it gets.

We went to Belfiore's Restaurant last Friday hoping to find some really good italian food since we are native New Yorkers and nothing beats food from NY.  We have tried countless italian restaurants and some of them were terrible.  (even that really expensive deli/restaurant in Scottsdale!) We ordered the Chicken Parmagiana along with sauteed string beans and eggplant parmagiana with angel hair pasta.  My husband wanted his chicken parmagiana to have eggplant as well which is usually an up-charge.  The waitress checked with the chef and said it would not be an upcharge.  When the food arrived, we couldn't believe the portions.  Now for the taste.  My husband loved his dish (with the added eggplant) and the string beans were sauteed with garlic and toothsome.  My eggplant parmagiana and pasta were delicious and large enough that I took some of it home and was able to get two lunches out of it. The waitress was very attentive without being bothersome.  At the end of the meal, we walked out to their bakery dept (they have a deli and a bakery there) and ordered a linzer tart to go.  When I asked how much, the gentleman said, "it's on the house!"  Unreal.  Never happens anywhere else.  Needless to say, I'll be back.  Thank you to the chef and staff of Belfiore.

I went to BelFiore's again today.  We had the most amazing meal that i have ever had in any Phoenix/Scottsdale Italian restaurant.  There, I said it!!!!!!! The eggplant was as delicious as delicious can be.  The chicken parmagiana with eggplant on it (special request) was fabulous.  (Although it took a little coaxing to get the cook to add the eggplant).  Donna the waitress was able to get our order through as we wanted it.  Thanks, Donna!   They gave us a generous portion of  bread rolls that had a great texture and came out hot although the inside of the rolls were still cold. The side salads that came with the dinner were just iceberg lettuce with a couple of thin slices of tomato.  I think the owner should rethink the iceberg lettuce or give customers the opportunity to upgrade the salad to mixed greens.  Despite the undesirable salad, Bel Fiore is forgiven because the food was stupendously good.  There was a birthday group and a number of couples tonight.  What I don't understand is why there isn't a line outside the door waiting to get in?!

By now you know I'm a fan....   Went there Saturday night and there were about 4 tables filled out of the whole dining room (Memorial Day Weekend) which has about 13 or 14 tables. Upon entering, the waitress told us to have a seat.  I spotted a table on my left which was already set up with place settings and approached the table.  The waitress then said," not there--we are seating by sections."  Sections?  I never knew there were sections and I've eaten here many, many times  There were people seated in that  so called "section" but we humbly moved along.   She directed us to an unset table in front of their toilet door.  If the table were any closer to the toilet door, people using the toilet would have had to say excuse me before entering.  Comically, or maybe not so much, a few of the patrons asked us if there was anyone using the bathroom before entering.  My husband asked me if we were bathroom monitors and commented that in his days as a junior high school teacher in a raucous neighborhood part of his teaching program included bathroom duty where he was required to sit outside the boys' bathroom (with another teacher in case of big trouble) for one period a day.  "Am I a bathroom monitor again?" he asked.  "No darling", I said.  "You are a senior citizen doing volunteer work as a bathroom monitor."  "At the next restaurant we go to, I will demand that you are given a higher position."   Our food came and as is typical of BelFiore --delicious and plentiful.  He: Eggplant & chicken cutlet with pasta.  Me: Shrimp Parmagiana & pasta--shrimp delightfully not overcooked.  Salads were simple with iceberg lettuce but they were included with the dinner; some places give you nothing.   The waitress (the one with tattoos-can't remember her name, sorry) gave us good service other than the fact that she sent us to "the toilet table."   May I recommend to BelFiore's management that they move that table away from the toilet area?  They have plenty of room in that vast dining area!   My greatest fear was that a diner with an upset stomach would use the toilet and share his/her upset stomach with us while we were trying to enjoy our dinners.  Fortunately, that didn't happen---- the power of Prayer!   Belfiore, you know I have to deduct a star for making my husband a bathroom monitor.  You get 4 stars for the rest.

Our Saturday evening visit to my favorite restaurant was NOT the same.  The food and  particularly the marinara sauce which accompanied most of our dishes was not the same delicious, perfect sauce that we have had in the past.  The meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were about 40% bread crumbs. Terrible mealy taste. My husband's chicken was over done.  Sorry, but I have to weigh in my disappointment.  I surmise that one of the chefs was on vacation and someone was substituting.  Let's not make this change permanent because it is not going to work out. On the other hand, our waitress Chris did a great job  taking care of us.  It's nice to see someone personable and efficient on the job.  Thanks Chris.   And I did notice some decor was put on the walls probably to assuage Yelpers who have complained about the "non-atmosphere" and the lack of decor.  Frankly, I don't care about the decor one way or the other--- I don't eat decor!   But messing with my food...that's another thing.   Come on Bel Fiore.... you know I'm a steady here and you disappointed me tonight....and on a Saturday night??  You should be on your best game.    Am I going to give you another shot??? maybe but not so soon.  I hope that when the summer months are over, they will get back to what they used to be.

Excellent, excellent Slouvaki!  Meat was plentiful, tender and juicy.  Onions were not too sharp which is nice.  Pita was firm but soft. I will go back again!

I had eaten a pork souvlaki here before so when we wanted to get our Greek-on, this is the place I recommended.  Here's how it went:  Gyro:   hubby said it was a 2.  Found the meat to be a tad salty and somewhat dry.    Pork Souvlaki:  Had lots of pork in it, but the slices were super thick and had no char on them.  Plus,the meat needed to be cut against the grain to avoid the shoe leather effect.  Since it was not, it was difficult to eat... had to tug on it which limited any enjoyment I could have gotten from it.  (Half of it is still in the fridge.) I found it to be excessively garlicky too.   The green yogurt sauce which came with it was delicious.   Vegetarian Platter:  Hummus was a 5, Babaganoush was a 5, Dolmadas a 5, but the falafel was a 1.  Falafel was super dry.  This dish came with a pita which as pillowy soft and a nice thickness.  The portion was small for $6.95 since there were only a few tablespoons of the soft items.    French fries:  Were too greasy to eat.  We put them in the oven hoping to drain some of the fat, but that did not work.    Were really disappointed in our meal.   The young lady who took our order was lovely even though I was concerned that her hair was all over the place and could end up in our food.

This is a fabulous market if you are looking for asian products.  The meat department is varied with almost any meat you can think of conventional or not.  The pricing on conventional items such as chicken or steak or short ribs (which was I was looking for) is competitive with your neighborhood supermarket.  The bargains are in the exotic meats such as beef heart, chicken feet (yum in chicken soup!), tripe, cow feet (makes a great soup), etc.  I will tell you that I was impressed with the cleanliness of the meat and fish department.  There was ABSOLUTELY no smell coming from meat market which is unusual.  Most meat depts have some kind of odor.  This speaks to how clean they keep the place.  I just bought a huge bottle of soy sauce for 1.88.  Rice, even brown rice, is dirt cheap.  the produce had some bargains such as ginger for 1.99 a lb.  It's 3 dollars or more in other places.  I didn't give it a 5 star rating because there is no English in the aisle signs so people like me couldn't find everything thereby cutting my shopping short.  I am sure I would have shopped more if I could figure out where everything was. There is small eating establishment in the front but the food in the trays didn't look so fresh when I was shopping there at 7PM.  I saw groups of asians eating there so the food must be good. Give it a try.  It's a fascinating place.

I am back to this market to buy some ethnic products and specifically to buy ginger.  Ginger is super expensive everywhere else.  It was priced in the $2 range.  Good buy.  I found the supermarket to be cleaner than I have ever seen it (or smelled it --LOL)  Considering they sell fish and meats, the air smelled clean.  Did they Fabreze the supermarket.  Other asian supermarkets have the smell factor.  This one did not and they had great specials today.  Try this market, you won't regret it.

Just saw" In the Year of the Rooster".  Last two performances today and tomorrow. What wonderful actors in a smallish, cute theatre performing interesting and captivating plays.  It is a great value for great entertainment.  I must say the actors are first rate and it is enjoyable to watch them implement their craft.  Kudos to all who are a part of Stray Cat Theatre.

You have to understand that my review comes from a Latino point of view and that I am an excellent cook.  On the particular day that I visited Sabor Cuban, I just didn't want to cook so why not let someone else cook for me?  I ordered the ropa vieja with moro rice and hubby ordered stewed ch.icken with white rice and black beans. We ordered green plaintains as a starter.  When the plaintains came--there were 3 on a plate.  Really, 3 plaintains is an order?? Come on guys, a whole plaintain costs 99cents and can yield 8 plaintains.  Very Chintzy.  My ropa vieja was tough and not flavorful.  The moro nice was clearly made with converted rice (which is not so bad for a restaurant) but with real long grain rice this dish can be amazing.  This was not--average at best.  My husband's stewed chicken (one thigh) was described by him as just OK.  By the way, the hot sauce and the water was great.  I have been considering opening up a restaurant for latin food in Phoenix (not Mexican, Latino) because the food is really mediocre.  I think I would blow them out of the water.  I would like the opinion of Yelpers.  Do we need a latin-caribbean restaurant in Phoenix?

Here for the first time letting Yelpers be my guide.  Wanted Greek spinach pie in the worst way as I hadn't eaten it in a LONG time.  George's is a simple store front restaurant where the menu is literally on the wall for all to see.  If you have questions you can go to the cashier/server.  We didn't know that she doesn't come to the table to take your order. So we kind of sat around staring at the menu/wall.  Then we had questions and went up to the lovely Katy, the young lady at the counter.  I say lovely because she was helpful and attentive and she thought we were a blast.  Hey, anyone who likes us that much can be called "lovely".  And yes, she really was.    Ordered the spinach pie which only came in appetizer portion and a pork soulvaki sandwich with fries.  Hubby ordered a pasta dish with green peppers, chicken breast and a garlic sauce.  His came with a huge side salad.  Everything appeared fresh.  The appetizer portion of the spinach pie had 6 triangular pieces.  Not so small for only $4.50.  Amazing.   My pork souvlaki sandwich served on a pita had onions and tzaziki sauce.  The french fries were well done as I had asked.  Pasta dish was enjoyed by hubby so no complaints there.   My sandwich was large enough to bring half home with some of the fries along with 4 pieces of the spinach pie.  What I am trying to say is that this place gives you portions.  No skimping here.   My only issue with my sandwich was that the pork had too much garlic and oregano.  Hubby thinks there is no such thing as too much oregano but you Yelpers out there know that too much of anything, especially oregano can overwhelm the food.   Hubby had no problem with the garlic and oregano in his dish as he found it to be dee-lish. Then again, it could be just me--everyone doesn't have the same palate.    So here you have it.  A simple greek place that doesn't take your order but smilingly brings it to your table and gives you great portions for very few "drachmas"   George's provides a good value in a clean and friendly environment.  All you Yelpers couldn't be wrong.  Thanks for the lead.

Did you know that BLT Steakhouse has a Blackboard Menu?? 4 courses (Appetizer, Main Course, Side and Dessert), $40, no substitutions.  Sounds great right?  How did I learn this??  Not from my server I didn't.  After hubby and I sat down and had placed our order from the big standard menu given to us by our server Sam (short for Samantha), I noticed that tables around us  had been given an additional handout along with their menus.  I was able to eye the handout from the adjacent table (we were really close cause my eyes are not all that good) and it read:  Blackboard Menu.  I asked a passing server if I could have a copy.  He graciously provided me with one.  The Blackboard Menu read as follows- Choice of appetizer (including salads) , a main course choice of Prime Flat Iron Steak, Wild Coho Salmon or Roasted Jidori Chicken with cornbread/ mesquite honey jus; Side order of Fried Green Tomatoes (which I adore), house-made tater tots, or broccoli mac and cheese and of course a dessert which included as one of the choices Peanut butter chocolate mousse.  You think maybe if presented with the Blackboard Menu I might have chosen to order from it??? YOU BETCHA.    So why wasn't I given the Blackboard Menu? Did we look too old and rich to be given this menu?  Well, I asked Sam, our server about why we didn't get this menu.  She coyly said, Oh....  Well,  you can order from that menu when you come back tomorrow!"   Being that it was my husband's birthday and I didn't want to spoil it for him, I didn't give her the answer that she deserved.  Normally, I would have said what I wanted to say and then walked out.   So I should come back the next day to get an option that I should have been offered today!? Really. Nice answer.  Good going, Sam.   Hubby was set on getting his Waygu, but for me the Blackboard Menu gave me some delightful options.   Thinking about what I ordered, the Grilled Shrimp,  without a sauce it is nothing more than large grilled shrimp that I could have made at home, but probably better.  I had asked Sam about the soy-citrus sauce that was available and she assured me the shrimp were marinated and didn't need the sauce.  Wrong again.  The broccoli mac and cheese would have been fine if the cream had been absorbed into the macaroni.  The cream was just a liquid in which the macaroni was floating.   Needed more oven time.  As prepared, it was nothing special.  Hubby's Waygu was perfectly cooked as was the baked potato (LOL) and grilled asparagus. He asked for chimichuri sauce which did not come until he had to request it again. Desserts were fine.    We think that knowing that Sam did not give us the Blackboard Menu in order to raise the bill and garner a larger tip is disconcerting.  With us, the tip is about service not the total amount of the bill.  We usually tip very generously irrespective of the total bill.  This whole event kind of spoiled the evening for us.

Ate here after looking at all the choices in the Mekong Plaza.  Tried their combination menu which included Egg Drop soup, spring roll,  fried nice and the the dish of your choice.  The soups came out and after two spoonfuls  I decided it was not worth eating due to the "unusual" taste and perhaps a bit of sourness such as when food is going bad.  I was afraid to eat it and gave it up quickly.  My hubby ate perhaps two more spoonfuls than I  (his palate is not as quick as mine) and then gave up on the soup.  He loves egg drop soup so for him NOT to eat it, you know something was wrong with it.  I mentioned to the server that something was really wrong with the soup--that it tasted funny and she gave me a half smile and walked away.  Didn't even take the soups away from the table until I visually prompted her to.  Perhaps not knowing enough English is the problem--probably.   The spring roll was tasty as was the colorless "fried rice".  Yes, although it was white with some peas in it, it did have a pleasant taste.  The pork chow mein I had was almost all noodle with just specks of pork.  Pork is cheap isn't it?  I don't get why there wasn't much of it.   Hubby's orange chicken was made as spicy as he requested and was not laden with crust--he really liked it.   It took a lot of coaxing to get the water glasses filled especially since it was a really hot afternoon.   After my first time here, I think that the food is OK and the prices are fair.  However,  I don't think I will go out of my way to eat here again---especially after the bad Egg Drop Soup (which I believe had the potential to make me sick)  and lack of pork in my dish.

This is quite a turnaround from my prior visits to Unphogettable and from my last review.  I dropped by today to have some PHOs which my husband, in particular, adores.  It is probably his favorite Vietnamese indulgence.  We ordered chicken phos only to find the broth to be almost tasteless (the word almost is my concession).  I found the chicken meat to be rather strange-- thick slices of what appeared to be chicken but tasted more like turkey breast.  Is that so bad you ask? Well, I found the meat to have a tough, flavorless consistency.  As a cook, I have a feeling that the broth was created with some commercial bouillon and then pieces of chicken? turkey? were thrown in.  This makes sense considering that most of their menu is soup based.  They have to be using alternative ways of creating broth. When I make chicken soup, the meat in its bone creates the broth and then you pull the meat off the bone and voila! a delicious, meaty  chicken broth.  This was not the case here. It was probably the worst PHO we have had in a long time.  My husband commented that the PHO we had in Paris, France was one hundred percent better than this PHO??  Can you believe the french make better PHO than Vietnamese in Mesa?  I remember the PHO in Paris so I can't disagree.  The point here is that Unphogettable better step up its game because you can live on your past reputation for only so long.  I did notice that there were not many ethnics eating here only non-vietnamese locals.  I am beginning to wonder if these people are the ones rating the place 4 and 5 stars when Unphogettable no longer serves good food and has basically lost its mojo.  BTW, a little research led me to fact that their regular chef is no longer there.   I ,  for one , am NOT returning either.  (The service was fine).

What an amazing place with awesome staff.  I have done A LOT of shirts with Brand X as well as sweatshirts and hoodies.  Great quality shirts, great printing and great prices.  I requested photos on some and they were done to perfection.  They are more than willing to fix anything that needs to be done to make a customer happy.  I will only buy my custom shirts form Brand X.

Went there on Saturday night with a Yelp coupon just to try the place.  It's a nice place--clean and attractive.  Ordered the pastrami/burger which came with cole slaw.  Also an order of half sweet potato fries/half regular, and the plain mac and cheese. We also had the two beef slider type burgers.  The pastrami burger was very good cooked just right.  The coleslaw needed a bit a seasoning perhaps a little more salt and definitely some pepper.  The fries were served with ketchup AND... are you ready for this?  Melted marshmallow sauce.  Too sweet and please lose this sauce!!!!  Perhaps a balsamic type of sauce would have complemented the sweet potato fries.  The sliders were good served with a pickle, grilled onions and lettuce and tomato.  The Mac and Cheese was elbow macaroni with some yellow cheese sauce.  I think a 7 year old would have liked it.  Not being 7 and being a good cook, I can only give the mac & cheese a 3 out of 10.  (I make mine from scratch with sharp cheddar, etc, etc... I can't tell you what else because then I would be giving away my recipe).  I would encourage the owner to have some bread crumbs put on top of the mac & cheese  and then put it in a broiler to bubble.  I think this will give it a less "Kraft mac and cheese" impression.  Our waiter was amazing, attentive to our water glasses being filled at all times.  The owner was there being charming with everyone there and even paying attention to all the cute babies (They were noiseless babies, thank G--d !)  Basically we enjoyed our food and will definitely be back.

Decided to give the Lodge a try so I bought a coupon.  Wanted to sit on the patio because it was the perfect night for it, but it was packed.  A good sign.  The inside was pretty full too so we headed for the dining room in the back (as opposed to the front bar area) and got a great table--half booth with chairs.  So far so good.  Ordered Moscow Mule as a drink and while it tasted good, I didn't think it was strong enough.  Mules usually pack a punch but this one didn't.  Ordered mac and cheese as an appetizer and to my surprise it was tasty.  (I had asked the waitress if it was out of a box and she had said no).  It was nowhere near how good mine is, but it was good enough that I would order it again.  It had the back drop taste of some jalapeños that gave it a really good taste.  Ordered the fish sandwich with cheese and tartar sauce.  It was ample and freshly made.  Came with waffle fries which had to be re-fried because they were much too light in color--I hate when fries are not cooked enough.  They have to be brown and crispy--that's what fries are all about.  Hubby had the "Smokey Burger" without the cheese and sweet potato fries.  He had asked for it medium rare but it came out medium to medium well.  It is really hard for cooks to make a burger medium rare.  I think they are afraid that people will get sick.  So hubby had his freshly made burger and totally enjoyed the sweet potato fries.  They were really good and most restaurants up charge for these fries.  Glad they don't.  Glasses were always filled with water and wait staff were attentive enough considering a packed house.  So my rating is going to give them a pass on the cooking of the burger because of the welcoming atmosphere and the good value of the food.  Prices are very reasonable.   BTW, and last but not least... NO WHINING CHILDREN ANYWHERE!!!   Oh my god.  I so enjoyed having  a meal where I don't have to listen to crying, whiny kids and parents who ignore it while the rest of us have to listen.

A beautiful library with great service people.  I went to return books today and I was helped by a wonderful staff person (young woman) in finding exactly what I wanted.  The also have special programs and events throughout the year.  Glad that my taxpayer dollars are going to a place like this.  Thanks for the excellent work librarians & assistants.

I have to admit that I have neglected giving this place a good review.  The place has everything from baby clothes to men's stuff to baby carriages. Yes, I saw baby carriages there today.  Their clearance sales can't be beat and the staff is friendly and super efficient at check out. And... best of all, Marshall's regular prices are amazing.  Love the store.

First time at Marco's.  The place is pleasant looking despite some Yelper's saying it needed a makeover.  It is trying for an old world look with paintings, maps of italy, etc.  They have these super comfy-looking booths which seat about 4.  Since we were only two, we sat at a table. Tables have linens on them giving the place a nice look; clean looking too.  We arrived in time for happy hour which is half-off appetizers and drinks.  We had "bread" as an appetizer--yes, you have to buy bread.  It is homemade and totally worth it.  They served it with a ramekin of good olive oil which was infused with garlic.  Dunking the bread in that olive oil was delightful.  We had a cabernet which was a little small, but I figured the happy hour portion was smaller.  We paid $4.50 for the wine, but I can't imagine that this portion would be $9.00 if it were not happy hour.   I ordered chicken piccata and I chose spaghetti with tomato sauce as a side.  My dining companion ordered chicken marsala with sautéed spinach when the chef indicated he couldn't make a chicken/eggplant combo without cheese.  Don't know why this was so difficult as we are able to get this dish at other italian restaurants.   We found the portions to be on the large side (as opposed to some Yelpers saying that the portions were small).  For $14.95 each entree, it was quite a nice portion.  Both chicken dishes were perfectly cooked.  I, who am not a marsala sauce fan, tasted the marsala and actually liked it better than my piccata sauce.  I like piccata super lemony and my sauce even had lemons on it, but I still would have preferred it with more lemon. Both dishes had a gravy boat with extra sauce.  Despite this, I enjoyed my dish.  My side pasta tasted freshly made with chopped tomatoes and garlic.  I really liked it.     The wait service was good.  Our waters were topped and they did come by to ask how our food was.    The place was filled by the time we were ready to leave so clearly this place is becoming popular.  I am definitely a return customer.

Last night  I craved Indian food and logged on to Yelp for help. My very favorite place is 18 miles away and I wanted something nearby.  I found Tandoori Times and arrived there at 8PM.  I couldn't believe that at 8PM there were 10 people ahead of us waiting for a table. " A good sign "I thought or "poor management that can't handle a crowd?"  Someone who appeared to be the owner was busy working to see that everyone got a table quickly.  We got a table in 10 minutes in a small room they have in the rear of the restaurant.  Within 5 minutes we got a waitress and placed our order.  She brought us condiments (a red spicy sauce, coriander chili sauce and a spicy sauce made with marinated ginger bits.   No papadums.  Most restaurants give you papadums.  We missed them.  My order of Chicken Vindaloo was absolutely delightful spiced just as I requested HOT.  Our double order of bread came hot and delish(we don't eat rice).  My husband's Lamb Tikka was generous and nicely done.  During our meal, the belly dancer started her act.  This meant that the loud music would soon begin.  AND I MEAN LOUD.  I don't know if it was that we were in that small room, but my eardrums were about to burst.  There was no relief until we ended our meal.  The belly dancer could not be seen from our room so we stood up to peek at what was going on.  It was an attractive young lady, dressing in belly dancing garb dancing to Indian pop music.  Not really belly dancing.  (I've done belly dancing myself.)  Next, dessert.  I ordered the Kheer.  It was absolutely amazing.  It was creamy with sliced almonds and raisins.  Probably one of the best I've had anywhere.   I gave Tandoori Times 4 stars because the music was too loud and it kind of spoiled the experience for us.  Other than that the food is really authentic and delicious.  I hope that the management will consider toning down the music at least for the poor people in the back room.  I would never accept a seat in that room when I return.  AND, I will return.

A got a Groupon gift for this spa.  Either a massage or glycolic acid facial with a mimosa.  I called the day before, got a noon appointment for the next day, but they asked that I arrive at 11:30AM.  I wondered about that because after all this was not a doctor's appointment where you need time to fill out the paper work.  I arrived at 11:25AM and there were several people (some guests of the hotel) in a line either paying or ordering their services.  A young gentleman came around from behind the desk and asked me to write my name on a roster.  I was called in almost immediately and shown around by a nice young lady who indicated that I could partake of the steam room, sauna, hot tub, etc.  I was not going to be doing that today only my facial.  So basically I sat in a lounge area and waited 30 minutes for my facial.  Could that have been the reason they told me to come in 30 minutes earlier than my appointment?  I certainly could have partaken of the services AFTER the facial so I don't get the wasted 30 minutes.  BTW, there were refreshments such as ice tea, lemonade, etc.  Very nice. Never got my mimosa though.    I opted for the glycolic acid peel (5%) which involved much more than that.  There was a wonderful treatment of the décolleté as well as an intensive hand treatment which warm creams and heated gloves.  Totally enjoyed that.  The glycolic acid treatment tingled just a tad and it was great.  My facialist was nothing short of amazing and there is no question that I will be back for a more intense glycolic facial. I really liked her.    When I got home, washed my hair and put on makeup, my skin looked great or at least I thought it did.  Isn't that what counts?    (Taking away one star for the unnecessary 30 minutes and for skimping out on the mimosa.  Come to think of it,  it could probably would have made the wait seem shorter)

You know, after reading the bad reviews, I figured I would share my bad experience at this store.  I went in for two problems on my MacBook Pro and reported to the person in the front to sign in.  I had made an appointment on line.  He confirmed my appointment and pointed to someone in the Genius Bar who would take care of me in a few minutes (I was about 8 minutes early for my appointment) .  After 10 minutes past my appointment, I asked again.  I was told another few minutes.  I waited about 10 more minutes.  Then  I decided to sit at the genius bar in front of the person who was to help me.  She was helping a woman who seemed very annoyed with her.  The Genius Bar person had been helping this woman for some time and that's what prompted me to sit there--kind of to speed things along.  When the Genius Bar lady tried to move on to me, the woman said I'm not done yet--I need more help.  To which the Genius Bar lady said: I've resolved most of your problems and gave you more time than allotted to you.  I have to help another customer.  The customer refused to move and demanded to continue.  The Genius Bar lady acquiesced and continued with her instead of attending to me, a person who had been waiting and had an appointment.   When the genius bar lady got to me she seemed rushed and after solving one problem and not spent the entire time with me, told me she couldn't help me with the second issue because it would take too much time.  I then told her that I had been kept waiting close to 40 minutes and that she spent so much time with the other woman who demanded that all her issues be resolved.  This apple employee should have gotten a supervisor to get the other customer to move on and/or gotten someone else to help me.  It was an annoying experience and considering that Apple products are NOT cheap, this is no way to treat a customer.   Product is important but customer service IS EVERYTHING!!!!

Was there last night.  Pho was a 2.5 on a scale of 5.  I had the one that costs a little extra with meatballs, tripe, brisket. Generous amount of meat, but you know what they say, Pho is all about the broth.  That's what makes it.  Every pho is made from  beef broth even the chicken pho.  And that wouldn't be bad if the broth was flavorful. Da Vang's broth is a 5 out of 5 but I decided to compare.  I had the spicy, salty shrimp with shells on.  They were ok but I didn't realize I would be eating the shrimp's caca in the process.  My guest had beef with snow peas.  It was spiced to his liking but the flavor just wasn't there.  Their prices are incredibly low and that's why I gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one.  You get what you pay for.  Back to Da Vang for me!!!!!

Was in the area on business and had some time to eat. It was about 10ish in the morning and the place was packed.  Were they giving food away?   They seated me quickly considering.  I love their Harvest Grain pancakes so that was my choice.  The stack of pancakes looked good until I stuck a knife in them.  Turns out I really didn't need a knife--I needed a fork.  The pancakes crumbled so much so that in order to eat them I had to push the fork tines against the pancake to  pick it up.  So clearly something happened to the batter---not enough butter--something was wrong.  I have never experienced anything like this with any of IHOP pancake ever.   Note to management:  Do something with the  Harvest Grain Pancake batter.  You kept me from enjoying one of my favorites.

Trying out Babbo for the very first time and was hoping that the trip was not a waste.  I did check Yelp reviews prior to going but you know how it is--sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong.   We were served sliced foccacia bread along with a dipping sauce made from an olive oil/balsamic vinegar mix.  I felt too much balsamic for the olive oil, but gave it a whirl.  But first I added black pepper, hot pepper flakes and a little salt.  Not bad, but I hate having to "cook" when I go out to dinner.  The foccacia and dipping sauce was quite nice.  But, but, but.... why is it that they never give you small plates so you can put your own bread on it and you don't drip olive oil from the table to your mouth??  So I asked Morgan, our server, if they have bread plates.  She says, "Sure" AND THEN she comes back with ONE plate (there are two of us ! Morgan).   Hubby's entree comes with a salad. He chose, "MISTA" or something like that.  Small salad but delicious.  Mixed greens with golden raisins, onion and PINE NUTS.... I love PINE NUTS.  It was topped with gorgonzola cheese and a sweet balsamic-type dressing.  Really good.  I stole some from hubby so I know.   Entrees arrive:  Spaghetii and meatballs for me and a "chalkboard" menu item which included chicken, marsala wine, mushrooms accompanied by veggies.  No pasta.  Pasta was $6 extra.  Really?On a $13 entree?  not even a teeny tiny bit of pasta on his plate! Now why,you ask, did I order spaghetti and meatballs.   BECAUSE IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT THIS DISH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW--that's why.   If you can't make a meatball you are DONE in an italian restaurant.  If you can't make a good SAUCE you are DONE as well.  So here it is:  the italian meatball was really, really, really good.  A little on the salty side but good enough for me because I like my food with a little saltiness.  That's just me.  The mix of spices in the meatball was great--sometimes restaurants put in too much oregano.  Not here.  It was a good mix of spices.  And now for the sauce... The question is whether this sauce could stand up to my own.  Yes, my dear readers, I make a killer sauce --the mother of all sauces; the "capo di tutti capo", the cat's meow; the slurpiest sauce around!  Let me put it to you this way, if I accidentally dropped my marinara sauce on my kitchen floor, hubby would say, "skip the mop... I'll lap it up".   No, really, it's that good.  With that, I am going to tell you that the sauce met my standards.  It was pretty good.  Better than mine.? No.  But remember this is a commercial establishment, they don't do the love thing that I do with the sauce. (Please do not let your imaginations wander).   So not to digress any further, the spaghetti and meatballs was a dish I would order again.  Hubby's dish, while he said it was good, was served on a smallish oval plate that made it look like a nothing portion.  PLUS, and this is important to the restaurant management:  The chicken along with the mushrooms looked like ALPO (the dog food) had been placed on the plate.  Now, keep in mind that he tasted it and liked it--the chicken, the mushrooms, the marsala wine and the sautéed veggies--He liked it all.  Do you think I was going to mention to him that it looked like an Alpo special??  Restaurants are supposed to make dishes ,at least, look a little pretty.  Even I do so at home.  There was no parsley garnish, nothing.  I make chicken fricassee at home and it doesn't look like mush.  Yes, mush.  That's the word I was looking for.  The mushrooms made it look like mush. Hubby said he would order it again so he liked it.  Management could you work on making this dish look more professional?  My spaghetti and meatballs was nice looking--a little parsley sprinkled atop of two beautiful Mount Vesuvious meatballs; beautiful red sauce.  Nice.  So after all is said and done I am giving this place 4 stars.  Morgan, you were a great server and very patient with us on ordering (it was our first time here) .  We forgive you for bringing just ONE bread plate.  Head on out to Babbo's.  You'll have a good meal for a good price in a family oriented setting.

Today, 2:35PM. Me; standing in line ready to pay.  4 other people on line. Cashiers:  Folding tee shirts and stacking them while we waited on line.  AND waited and waited.   Me:  Wondering when it would dawn on the cashiers to attend to customers ready to spend US currency in this bad economy.   Assessment:  These two guy cashiers have NO DAMN brains & management has fewer neurons for allowing this to take place.

Excellent Asian products with the greatest variety I have ever seen. Frozen foods, meat and fish department, produce, everything you will need to cook any Asian meal or otherwise. They even have Spanish Goya products, Indian spices, you name it they have it. The market is surrounded by restaurants and other businesses. A great supermarket and food court for a fabulous afternoon of shopping. Enjoy and discover!!!!

First time here and boy am I glad I came.  All those great Yelp reviews steered me in the right direction.   Had the Chow mein with chicken, Ginger Beef, and Basil Chicken.  All of them delicious!  My favorite was the Ginger Beef.  Finally a dish that calls itself Ginger AND has ginger in it.  Lots of it.  Wonderful flavors.  The Chow mein was very good and finally the Basil Chicken.  In the Basil chicken, The chicken was slightly overcooked.  I have this problem in every Thai restaurant I go to.  Overcooked chicken. This is probably due to the fact that they use breast (white chicken) which is easy to overcook.   However, I will tell you that Thai House has a new fan.  The food is exceptional and the portions are generous.  Good service too.  Will be back real soon.

Vegas places tend to be overpriced for mediocre food.  But, do not fret.  Your problems are over!   The Hash House a Go Go should be your go-to place, at least for breakfast.  They also serve dinner and lunch as they are open 24 hours a day.  The best time to come for breakfast is between 7:30am- 8:30am.  After that you will wait between 30-60 minutes for a table.   You can have a simple breakfast for 9.99 which includes two eggs, bacon or another meat choice, delicious chunky potatoes (they call them hash but it's not a hash), a biscuit or toast with homemade strawberry jam.  It is so large that I couldn't eat all of it.  The other dishes on the menu are so large that when other people got their food I went around taking photos of their food like a roving photographer.  Some people wanted me to have some of their food, LOL.  Just wanted the pictures!   So when you see all these photos, I don't want you to think that I ordered every one of these dishes.  But take a look and see if you agree that this is the place to go for breakfast in Vegas.  They have three spots in various hotels.  BTW, I hear their chicken and waffles is to die for and that certainly qualifies as a great dinner option.   Enjoy! Enjoy!

First time here.  Got the Italian combo Mike's way which included oregano, oil & vinegar, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, etc.  All cold cuts were cut at the moment of preparation which means that all were super fresh.  I had a choice of white or wheat bread (not whole wheat) which was a darker version of the white.  I don't think that the servers know that white bread is still wheat bread... I digress.   Ate the sandwich home and thought the sandwich was amazing.  I like the fact that the bread was not that thick--more cold cuts than bread and that there was a nice crunch with the added veggies.  At my request they added hot cherry peppers and they did deliver a hot punch which I enjoyed.  Speedy service too!   I was a fan of a sandwich place that begins with a C but I think Jersey Mike's won me over.

These are truly professional, skilled people.  They were able to put together a new key with a key that was totally bent out of shape.  The new key is better than the original.   Highly recommended.

This place deserves 5 stars simply because their drive thru is open 24 hours.  Can u imagine coming out of a casino or a movie and being hungry and not having a place to eat.  I've had the fish here and the burgers and fries and they have never screwed it up even when I asked for no tartar sauce.  Do you know how many times other places put it on anyway. Thumbs up guys.  Thanks for being there!

I didn't want to cook so I had my husband drive down to Mesa about 16 miles.  I waited for the waitress and finally went to the counter to find out if the orders had to be submitted at the counter.  The waitress apologized and came to our table.  She gave us menus and when I had questions about the dishes, she informed me that she was alone taking care of the tables and therefore was rushed.  After ordering, the food came out looking fine until I tasted it.  The food was lukewarm if not cold.  The black beans were more cold than warm.  I felt terrible that I dragged my husband out for this uninspired cold meal.  My food was not bad, but I wouldn't do it again.  By the way, green plaintains are supposed to be flattened until thin--that makes them crispier.  Another lesson for the cook.  It's too bad.. the place probably has potential. I am an amazing carribbean cook.  I don't know why I bothered going out to eat.  A break for moi perhaps?

I like the tables, I like the slots.  But they need to get a better filtration system so all the smoke in the air is expelled.  They may need to have smoking and non-smoking areas to make it more comfortable for non-smokers.  The smokiness is overwhelming.

Saw Lush Burger on Check Please Arizona then looked them up on Yelp.  The ratings for service were abysmal.  Complaints that staff were not attentive, had devil-may-care attitudes.  A few moments later I received the Clipper Magazine and as I perused, I saw coupons for Lush Burger.  I decided it was fate and gave them a try.  The patio was full yet inviting but what scared me away was a table full of kids, loud like kids can often  be.  I don't have problems with kids.  I have problems with parents who don't supervise kids when they get out of control.  So I decided to have a peaceful dinner and went inside.  I was seated almost immediately at about 7PM--check.  DJ our server gave us menus and brought us water--check,check!  We ordered the classic with cheese and a plain classic with raw onions--medium rare.  They came out perfectly cooked as were the regular fries and sweet potato fries that we ordered. (Triple check!)  We asked for a spicy sauce and we got the "House" hot sauce---absolutely delicious.  DJ came by to see how everything was.  Very attentive lad.  Used the coupons without a problem which helped out with the check (a little bit because our burgers were not the expensive ones to begin with).   I found everything to be on point during this visit and did not experience what others have in terms of bad service.  I will definitely be back.

I was there Friday night to play some cards and then we got hungry.  Selected asian entrees -Chow Mein with Shrimp and Green Curry with chicken.  Both were delish  Then I looked over to the neighboring table and saw how beautiful the steak fries looked.  I asked the waitress (Lisa) about them and she told me they were seasoned fries and very good.  I have never seen any large steak fries like that seasoned.  Next time I will order those fries.  Lisa our waitress kept the water glasses filled and served us in a timely and friendly manner.  thank you Lisa!  I will be back!

Since my first review I have been to Millie's to pick up orders of Pasteles (both pork and chicken), alcapurrias (banana fritters stuffed with ground beef), and morcilla (blood sausage).  All of these are uncooked and I cook them myself at home.  What a fantastic idea to have all of these things in the freezer and when I get home from a day out or a shopping spree, I basically don't have to cook!   Put the pasteles on for 45 minutes, add a salad or some veggies on the side and you are done!!! Delicious home made food in less than an hour.  This rocks!  The alcapurrias I fry up 5 or 6 at a time and keep them in the fridge.  Then simply microwave them (wrapped in paper towels) and it is a delicious mid afternoon snack.  I am disappointed that the morcilla is not regularly available as it is only available during the Christmas holidays.  I wish they would take orders and make them available several times a year.   Continue to make your delicious food Millie... see you this Wednesday to pick up my new order of your yummy food.   Gracias y buena suerte......  BTW folks,  this is the ONLY real Puertorican restaurant with real puertorican food in the Valley.  Others may be big and fancy but their "puertorican" menu ideas of versions of the real deal.

I have been coming to Millie's to pick up food for the longest and it time to update my review and to motivate all you caribbean (puerto rican, cuban, jamaican, dominican,  etc etc) and all you caribbean-minded people to come to Millie's to eat.  Now I order food from Millie's because I live so far from her place that a casual visit to eat there would make a hole in my wallet from the cost of the gas.  So I order food from Millie's and get it frozen in bulk to take home and keep in the freezer.  Yesterday I ordered 24 pasteles and while there, had one of her delicious alcapurrias (fried, ground root veggies stuff with ground beef).  When I eat one of these my feet stop touching the floor---I am floating toward heaven.  They sell them frozen too and I buy a dozen at a time and have them at home whenever I want a quick, delicious meal.   While there I also noticed she had Sancocho on the menu and I felt compelled to bring one home.  It came with white rice on the side.  That was my dinner yesterday and let me tell you it was delicious.  I could make it myself but Millie includes 3 meats in hers (pork, chicken, beef) as well as the root vegetables.  By the time I buy all that stuff AND cook it it would cost me quite a bit not to mention the effort and time of cooking it myself.  Don't get me wrong.  I could.  But who wants to when you have Millie.? I just had some pasteles for dinner (the ones I picked up yesterday) and they were soooooooo delicious,  I felt I had to update my review to let you know that Millie's just keeps getting better and better and to encourage anyone within a 50 mile radius of Millie's to give her a try.   Her passion for cooking (those of her daughter's words)  shows itself in every single dish.  BTW, I hear her desserts are amazing.  I haven't bought any because I made my own, but people rave about them. Importantly, Millie's is an impeccably clean establishment so not worries there.   Thanks Millie for making those delicious pasteles for me to order and having them ready on time.   Un million de gracias.

On Friday, I decided to try yet another italian restaurant in my quest to find a restaurant that serves NY quality food. We were greeted very nicely and asked if we wanted a large booth or a table. We opted for the large booth (I love booths).   The server identified himself as Don--friendly and clean cut.  He asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he was quick to tell us that the food at Gaspar's is AMAZING.  He told us the owners were from Silicy and NY (which peaked my interest.)  I ordered the pasta puttanesca and pointed out that the menu did not indicate anchovies in it. (Puttanesca sauce usually has anchovies.)  He quickly said, no problem--will add anchovies.  (Great, so far, so good.) My husband as usual complicates matters.  He wanted chicken parmagiana with no cheese and wanted slices of eggplant on the chicken.  We asked Don what the upcharge was for adding the eggplant and after checking with chef, he said there was no upcharge. (Ka-ching!) While waiting for our orders, Don brought a bread basket full of a thin flatbread type, a cross between foccacia and pita, drizzled with olive oil with garlic and black pepper. YUM, YUM.  We inhaled the bread basket and without asking Don made sure we got a second helping. (Very cool, Don.) Our plates arrived beautifully presented.  Then we tasted.  My puttanesca sauce was indeed amazing.  At that point, I yearned for a glass of port wine to go with my meal.  My husband's chicken eggplant dish was enough for two people and I must say I have NEVER seen a chicken cutlet as large and thick as the one he got, slathered with delicious marinara sauce with the eggplant on it as well.  You know I had to taste his chicken dish and it was indeed AMAZING just as Don had said.  We didn't have room for dessert but Don told us that they are all home made by the owner.  Maybe next time.  AND there WILL be a next time!  What I don't understand is: WHY AREN'T PEOPLE FLOCKING TO GASPAR'S?????  Maybe because it's  a new restaurant (since July) . I am giving this glowing review because they earned it so I want to assure all that I don't work for the restaurant nor am I an investor.   I didn't give it 5 stars because I was charged $8 for 4 ounces of port wine.  It was a small glass, half full.  I think they  have to rethink that part.   I didn't say anything about it then because Don and the food had been so AMAZING.  What a great evening! I'll be back when Don's on duty--he made us feel like royalty.

Went for dinner because I was craving some shrimp and was hopeful that they would make them just the way I like them--light on the batter and not greasy.  Upon being seated, we were served with complimentary chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh but the salsa was not spicy enough for us.  We are beasts when it comes to spiciness.  I think it would have good enough for the average Joe (he, he.  Get it,Joe?) I ordered a Modelo Negro beer and then a Pinto Margarita.  The Modelo Negro beer, delicious--nice and cold.  The Pinto Margarita had Pommegranite Patron, Triple Sec and some other delights.  Very strong, very good tasting and large enough for two to share for only $10.     For food, I ordered the fried shrimp platter which came with yellow rice (i usually only like my rice, but it came with the platter), thick sliced potatoes, a salad with spring mix, red cabbage & other greens, and 6 butterflied shrimp.  At first glance the shrimp looked good--golden but not too much; not too small but not huge.  I put one of them in my mouth and then it hit me--Nirvana; also known as shrimp heaven.  I think what made them perfect was that they were perfectly seasoned and perfectly fried.  No grease here.  The salad was fresh with a bit of ranch-type dressing.  I like it when they don't overdress the salad.  The thick potatoes were real potatoes ,(when everything is usually frozen in restaurants) slightly fried but not too fried.  They were cooked through and it's nice to taste something natural for a change.  The yellow rice I approached with trepidation since I am only a fan of my own rice (and biryani's at indian restaurants).  It was a simple yellow rice with nothing in it and yet it had a nice taste about it.  I couldn't help but eat it.  The real summary is that I cleaned my plate.  A little shrimp bite, a little potato, a bite of rice and that Margarita (and beer), was motivation enough to wipe that plate clean. I wonder if they had to wash it after I was done with it?  Just joking folks.  BTW, the place was clean and every time a customer left, the staff cleaned under the table as well as the usual top table clean up.   Now for the second dish.   A platter of Whole Red Snapper with garlic sauce.  Came with the accompaniments I described before which were all good.  The snapper was a hefty size and hubby ate it to the bone although red snapper is not his favorite fish.  He likes fish with a strong taste to it like blue fish (ugh! Poo-ee, yuk, argg) or flounder.  I asked if he could savor the garlic sauce and he said :Maybe.  Now keep in mind that I could see the chopped up garlic on and below the fish that's why I was asking. I really thought he was going to say it was overwhelming.  Nope--- he's no Dracula.   Keep that garlic coming and it's never enough.   We asked the waitress for a spicier salsa than the one they first served us.  She gladly obliged but the salsa while spicy had no flavor.  It was just strong spice, no taste.  So we reverted to the original salsa.  The original salsa could have been made spicier by simply adding some chopped habaneros which is a really flavorful pepper.  That's how you do it (This has been an editorial from Yvonne who thinks she's a really good cook. LOL)   Did I forget to tell you that the platters came with your choice of corn or flour tortilla?  I didn't forget.   I left it for last for a reason.  At the end of the meal, I was curious about the tortillas (after all I am definitely coming back to this place),opened the tortilla case, took off a piece of tortilla and tasted it.  After a few chews, I grabbed my napkin and spit out the tortilla.  What was wrong you ask?  (I hope the owners/management are asking the same question as you my dear readers).  RANCIDITY.  That's what was wrong.  Either the fat used to make them, cook them was rancid or they made them in such bulk that they got rancid during storage.  I don't believe they are made in large quantities and stored since they were soft and pliable and really looked yummy.  But this was not about me not liking the taste or the texture of the tortilla.  This was old fat that turn rancid (Rancio, in Spanish).  That is a big faux-pas for a mexican place.  Imagine that I ordered burritos and they were made with these rancid tortillas?  Not a good thing.   The waitress was wonderful and her service was spot on.  The four stars are for the food and our wonderful waitress.  FIX THOSE TORTILLAS!

Had to update my review of Baja Joe's after the great meals we had there.  Great Salsas (we had two--one more spicy than the one they gave us initially)  with freshly made tortilla chips--all complimentary!  5 Stars    Fried Shrimp with spanish rice, fried natural potato slices (nothing frozen here!), salad and warm flour tortillas.  Yum! shrimp with squirts of lime and dips in tartar sauce!  Sounds sexy doesn't it?  5 stars.  Breaded, fried filet of sea bass with all the above sides.  5 stars  Model Negro draft beer, 22 ounces, nice and cold and dark---5 stars  Flan with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle--homemade, decadent and delicious!  5 stars   Service, you ask????   Nothing but a perfect 10.  I loved our attentive waitress.  She made sure we had our waters and drinks and checked on us several times to make sure we were happy with our meal.   Yup,  these were 5 star meals and if I were you I would be heading out to Joe's.

Picture this.  Monday 5pm.  I finished shopping at Sam's.  Dying for a cup of coffee and a donut.  Drove to the Dunkin Donuts across the way from Sam's.  Gee, nobody at the counter.  Waited for somebody to come out.  Called out, Hello.  No response.  I called out again, "hello, hello,  you have a customer here."  No answer.  Took a look into the back and saw that there was a young lady taking care of the drive-thru.  Yes, they have a drive-thru.  A drive-thru for better service? for better efficiency? to handle more customers?  Hmmmmm. What about the customer who has been in your store for 4 minutes without so much as an answer from ANYONE????  Finally, looking toward the back I see a tall, olive skinned guy open a door.  I say:  Hi, I would like to order."  He says, "I'm busy right now, can you wait? "  (kind of in a gruff manner)   I say:  OK, OK. (I really wanted that coffee).   With that he comes to the front, grabs two donuts and goes to the back without saying ONE word to me.  I wait another 2 minutes alone, in silence, in the front.  Waiting 2 minutes can seem like an eternity especially when for 7 minutes there has been no service.  I decided to leave and get my stuff elsewhere.   It baffles me that in this economy, a store would let a customer walk out without a purchase.  So, no coffee purchase, no donut purchase, no treats for my family from Dunkin Donuts.  This particular Dunkin Donuts is located in a very active shopping area.  That is what is saving it.  I predict that with such bad service, in my case, no service, there will be declining sales or a closing of its doors.  The arrogance of the clerk, ignoring me knowing that I was there after speaking to me, and walking to the counter area without as much as a look in my direction, tells me that he has no interest in making this store a success.   Walmart is steps away and they sell donuts too--50 cents cheaper per donut than Dunkin Donuts.  Wake up Dunkin Donuts management. Wake up future customers.

Another good Yelp choice!  Sold us a fabulous pair of HOKA athletic footwear that provided much needed support and comfort for hubby.  After a week of wearing them, he said they were the best pair of shoes he has ever had.  BTW, they let you buy, try them for 30 days and if you don't like them you can return them for a store credit ( I believe it is a credit but check with them). Service was attentive and helpful.  Certainly worth a return visit when I need a good pair of athletic shoes.

'Thank you Yelpers for giving me Zaytoon as a recommended restaurant. We had lunch there today to give it a try.  I had the falafel sandwich with a side order of Tabouleah salad and my friend had the lamb kabob wrap. The falafel was moist and well garnished with lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The tandoori bread was awesome.  It came with a side of what seems to be avocado mixed with humus (at least that's what my taste buds said).  The lamb kabobs were perfectly cooked and generous.   I checked out the bathroom and it was very clean.  The whole atmosphere is clean and tidy and the owner/ staff were very welcoming.  I will be back 'to try something different.  and... the prices are very reasonable ($4.99 for falafel and 8.99 for the lamb.) Don't miss this place.

This review is for Jimmy John's on 33rd Street and Bell Road.  Can't find it on the Yelp listing.  It was my first time buying an italian combo at JJ's.   Here what I found: 1.  The bread is too mealy. 2. Not enough meats and no pepperoni.  An italian sub with NO PEPPERONI?????      In all fairness, I just noticed on the menu that for another dollar I could have gotten more deli meat. Really, I have to upgrade to get a decent sandwich?  I should have. 3.  They gave me nice hot peppers, but it didn't compensate for the lack of flavor of the sandwich... Sorry.  I will be going back to Capriotti's.  I really like their italian combo.  There is so much deli meat in them that you can nearly close the sandwich.

I was a fan of the old Teakwoods which was housed in what is now Tavern Grille.  I tried out Tavern Grille and loved it. The food was great, they added desserts and on some days the owners oversaw the goings on which contributed to good and quick service. So I am a fan.  Today I went to Tavern Grille with a friend and we had burgers and sliders. When the burger came I saw that it came with a one piece of thin slice of pickle maybe 1/8 inch thick and 3 inches long( Crossectioned).  I noted that my sliders did not have any pickle.  I can' t possibly think of eating hamburger or slider for that matter without a pickle.  So at my earliest possible opportunity I called the waitress over and asked for a FEW slices of pickle.  Pickles?, she asked. Yes Pickles, I responded.  A few minutes later she returned with one slice of pickle on a plate. I couldn't believe my eyes. A patron makes a special request for pickleS and you provide one pickle on a plate?  Amazing.  If they couldn't give more than one pickle perhaps the waitress should have told me that more pickles would have required an upcharge.   I would have paid it.  So I didn't finish my sliders, paid my check, walked over to Fry's Marketplace and bought a jar of pickles.  I will eat the rest of my sliders with my newly bought jar of pickles.  Pickles and day old sliders.  Better than freshly made sliders without pickles.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

The minute I got home from Tavern Grill I went on the internet looking for a funeral home.  No, not for me or a relative....For Tavern Grill.  Tavern Grill is DEAD. It's going to be a big funeral folks and the actual date is not too far away.  You might say Tavern Grill is in hospice for now.   I must have forgotten my previous review of the Tavern Grill and went there Saturday night because it was the closest place to my house.  I figured what could be bad about a sports bar on a Saturday night when you don't want to cook.  Well, here's what I learned today about Tavern Grill: 1.  If you expect to get a slice of tomato on your burger as specified on the menu, don't.   2.  If you expect your waiter not to roll his eyes when you point out that there is no tomato, don't . 3. If you expect the one thin piece of lettuce on your burger not to be super dark green and totally wilted, don't. 4. If you expect lemon wedges with your seafood order or in your drinking water, don't. 5.  If you expect your shrimp to be the same size as the breading around it don't.  The size of shrimp inside is smaller than they appear.  Be sure to open wide for the breaded crust.   6. If you expect the hot sauces that are brought to you to be clean enough to put your hands around the bottles without getting smutz on your hands, don't.  I should have known better and kept Clorox wipes in my bag for this purpose. 7.  If you expect your burger to be given to you in one piece and not broken into two for no good reason, don't  Hmmmm.....Did they put two leftover burgers together? 8.. If you expect the owner to be around so you can talk to him about the quality of the burger, don't. He's in Cottonwood attending to the new hotel he bought.  I hope he makes tons of money there because in a year he'll have to sell Tavern Grill for 10 cents on the dollar.  .  If you expect a sports bar like Tavern Grill to be hopping on a Saturday night, don't.      You could have held a religious service there. Or maybe more appropriately--a funeral...And .It's going to be a big one!

$6 Appetizers on Thursdays! Had Drunken Shrimp... OMG..... Spicy, delicious, garlicky, wing sauce with 7 shrimp. Tasty beyond belief. Cheeseburger sliders also great. Changed my mind about this place.  Has really improved over time.

Had dinner on Friday.  It was happy hour which meant that it was $2 off the appetizers.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps. They came with peanut sauce and sweet sauce on the side.  Very tasty and crunchy with cashew and noodles. Main dishes were Beef with Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  The server asks you how spicy you want it and I said very spicy (to her this meant Thai Spicy)  The second dish was Chicken in Sweet and Sour sauce.  The Beef dish was spectacular in flavor and I ate all the broccoli (which I usually do not eat at all) because it was al dente (broccoli was not soggy or overcooked).  I really, really enjoyed it.  My companion liked the sweet and sour sauce but felt the chicken was overcooked.  I checked it out and agreed.  But the sauce was very good.  Our server Netty? came by often to check on how we were doing and how we liked our food.  She made sure our water glasses were kept full.  The water had cucumber slices in it which made it taste super refreshing.  We had a $10 coupon from the card deck that is sold in participating restaurants so we saved a few bucks. The bottom line is that we finally found a Thai restaurant that we like and is open 7 days a week.  OOPS, forgot to tell you that there is a nice guy playing the guitar and trying to sing classic melodies.  It was a nice touch. Can't blame a guy for trying.

Attended a Yelp event at the Filmbar and I had never been.  Great wines, beer and a great atmosphere.  Has several comfortable lounges, one next to the bar and one behind the curtain (to the right as you come in).  Enjoyed my time there especially the movie -- and those oh, so, comfortable seats.  Staff was very welcoming.  I don't know how I hadn't been here before!  Looking forward to going again. Thanks Lindsey for introducing us to this great place and for yet another wonderful event.

Yelpers you were right again!  Had the combination dinner of mongolian beef, fried rice, spring roll & wontons.  Everything was delicious and although the fried rice was meatless it was flavorful--some of the best fried rice I've had in the valley.  Hubby had the egg drop soup which I thought was absolutely delicious but he thought it was a little salty (but what does he know?!) .  He did like the flavor, but you know, always a complaint.  He had the orange chicken with brown rice which he liked especially because the crust was not heavy and they spiced it up the way he likes it.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service was attentive since it was a rainy day and we were the only ones there.  Their delivery business seemed brisk (although not to my area.)   I'll have to drive there to pick up my orders but I tell you, it will be very much worth it.  I definitely will be back.   Thanks to Yelpers who give credit where credit is due.

There were 276 reviews for Reathrey Sekong when I decided to take my family there so here is number 277.  I like the fact that this review has two 7's in it.  Yup,  that means luck, double luck in this case.  WOW.  Was I LUCKY to come to Reathrey?  YES!!! Egg rolls so delicious I had to order twice. Spring rolls (with tofu, instead of shrimp and chicken) that I had to order twice.  Maybe that coincides with the first number of this review!!!!  Yup.  That's it! Ordered beef & shrimp with noodles. Had some greens in it.  OMG how delicious and how fresh were the shrimp! Also, Beef with ginger, lots of it, gingerlicious. Beef with noodles, sprouts and a fried egg on top (I forgot the name)--it's on the left side of the menu...  amazingly delicious. All accompanied by Jasmine rice.   Don't know why I hadn't found this place before.   BTW, clean and decorated with tasteful Asian decor and lovely piped in Asian music.  Oh..... is this Nirvana or is 277 just my lucky number.

I wish I could say a few negative things so I could keep the rest of you away from my new- found delicious, authentic, chinese place.  But that would be mean.   Here's what I ordered. Chicken fried rice:  not the usual brown color; it was white but had lots of flavor.  Enough chicken, some peas and carrots.  I would have loved bean sprouts and green onion in it but that was not the case.  Next time I will ask for bean sprouts.  Stir fry with pork stomachs with peppers (he, he, he):  Awesome dish. Very flavorful.  My grandmother made something similar so I came in with expectations and was not disappointed.    Lamb with Cumin:  Very spicy excellent dish.  Now I am NOT a lamb eater but this dish made it delish.  I would order it again.    Chicken with Mushroom in a POT.  Large, large portion with a large, large price.  12.98 for this dish but it could easily feed 3 or 4.  Potatoes with mushroom and lots of chicken.  However TOO SALTY.  We brought it home so I can make white rice without any salt to balance out the salt in this dish.  When you pay that much for a chinese dish you have to try to save it.   We arrived about 5:45PM and it was half full. By the time we left, the place was packed.  Maybe that's why I had to hold my empty water glass up in the air and swing it back and forth to get somebody's attention.  It took a while.  They serve you food and then they go away so this is not a service oriented place.  This is a "we serve great food" place so don't get offended if they don't come by to ask how your food is.   BTW, lots of ethnic diners which told me right away that I was in for a treat.  I would definitely eat here again despite the long trip to get here.

I am only updating my review because this place never ceases to amaze me.   Had the wonton soup which came in a bowl large enough to feed four.  Unfortunately, I didn't know the size and ordered it just for myself.  The broth was light, non-salty but flavorful.  There was a generous number of  wontons with their porky goodness.  Some of them dislodged from the meat but who cares... I do have a spoon to rescue them don't I?   I also ordered the onion pancake (aka scallion pancakes in other places).  Sooooo good---not greasy.... just right.   We ordered the chicken fried rice super spicy and I will tell you they were not afraid to turn up the heat.  I couldn't believe the portion size!  Another dish was the orange chicken which we requested without the typical breading.  It was amazing to see how they accommodated that request without blinking an eye.  It was delicious and generously portioned.  We cleaned our plates with the exception of the wonton soup which we brought home.  Who says you can't have wonton soup for breakfast?  I just did!   The place was packed when we arrived and yet they managed to serve us at a good pace. The food was really, really good.... maybe that's why I bothered to update my review and give them the 5 stars they deserve.

I went to Greek Pita without doing a Yelp check.  Came out of the movies, saw the place and thought that spanokopita (spinach pie) would be a great snack before going to bed.  A spinach pie.  What could be bad about that?  Took an appetizer portion to go and drove home anxiously awaiting that delicious pie.  Opened the container and saw a bed of lettuce under it--nice, I thought. Then I made one mistake.  I lifted the spinach pie.  And there is was--- a pool of grease not only on the lettuce but on the entire bottom of the spinach pie.  It was shiny from the grease and four paper towels DID NOT absorb all of the grease on this unworthy pie.   So after shocking my husband with a view of this greasy mess, he shook his head and said:  You're not going to eat that are you?  I told him that I had to take a bite in order to do an accurate Yelp review.  He watched me to make sure it was only one bite.  After all, he didn't want to have to drive me to the hospital if I got sick or on a lighter note, have to get up from bed to get me the Pepto-bismol.  So I tasted it. It was not bad, but it was not good.  Not enough feta cheese and did I taste a bit of mozzarella in there?  That's not the Greek way of making it.  I know. I make it.  So my laziness of not making a tray of spanokopita led me to craving it and ending up with something my own kitchen would not produce.  Ever.   So I give the spanokopita one star for the price.  A total of $2.44 with the tax.  BTW, after the bite taken on behalf of Yelp, the kitchen disposal totally enjoyed it.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRR.... I heard the disposal say----Is it mad at me??????

Just had the following with my dining companion: 1.  2 meat combo (skewered chicken & chopped meat) comes with rice, tomato, pita.      EXCELLENT.  2.  BabaGanoush---Outstanding---the star of the show 3. Tabouleh--- Excellent, nice portion. 4.  Spanokopita (spinach pie) That was the reason for my visit-- Unfortunately they bake it and then when you order it they fry it up.  Too much grease on it.  I had to use napkins to soak up the grease and still it tasted greasy.  So sad.  This is my favorite greek dish that I travel for-- this is why I came.   5.  Complimentary LENTIL SOUP WHICH WAS DELICIOUS!!!  ( so they made up for the less than stellar spanokopita)   Plenty of pita was provided along with garlic sauce and a spicy sauce which I think was Harissa.  Not sure but it was tasty. Positive attitude and smiles from everyone.  Very clean and Prices are very reasonable.   Will definitely be back.

First time here--for lunch.  After ordering, we got some fresh breads and an olive oil/roasted pepper mixture which was delicious with the bread.  Had some spiciness to it but nothing that would keep you from eating it.  Very lovely and very complimentary!  Quick with the waters too.  The lunches are quite reasonably priced.  $8 for their spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs have the reputation (according to the menu) of being NYC's best.  A nice salad of mixed greens came with it with two cherry tomatoes.  Balsamic was just right.  My dining companion ordered a chicken and eggplant sandwich with a spicy marinara sauce which came with a salad on the side.    My spaghetti and meatball (yes, ONE mountainous  meatball) presented very well. I tasted the pasta and it was AL DENTE--not overcooked and the red sauce was very good--not sweet.  I hate sweet sauces.  Save the sweetness for desserts not for pasta sauce.  The impressive meatball was made of veal and pork and while it was not a bad meatball texture and taste wise, it was not the explosion of flavor that I expect from a really good meatball. So NYC's best it cannot be.   I ate all the pasta and 3/4 of the meatball--it was that large.  The chicken & eggplant sandwich was pretty decent and they made the sauce spicy just as we asked.   Dana, our delightful server, made sure the service moved nicely, that we had our waters filled, and answered all our questions about the menu.  I have not run into such an amiable and competent server all rolled into one in a long time.  Thank you Dana.  You made our first lunch at Aiello's quite enjoyable.

I had the eggplant parmagiana with pasta.  I liked the eggplant but didn't care for the penne with sauce.  The sauce has nothing going for it.  My companion ordered one of his favorites, chicken marsala.  It was accompanied by less than 1/4  cup of garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  The chicken cutlets were small and thin.  Half way through his meal he asked me if we had anything in the fridge at home because he was definitely still hungry.  He said it was the first time he ate a meal at the restaurant but was still hungry.  Needless to say,  I had to go home and whip something up. No bread was served. At an italian restaurant?????  I think that they have to rethink the size of their portions if they want to start in business.  I would have difficulty going back because I would still have to come home and cook!   The server was excellent by the way.

In all fairness to my prior review, the chicken marsala was delicious despite the smallness of the portion.  I also forgot to add that they were out of meatballs and calamari at the time we arrived (6:30pm).  Italian restaurant out of meatballs????? And calamari was to be my appetizer!.   This place is so close to where I live. I wish they would get their act together!

We just had chicken PHO and Tofu spring rolls to try out the place.  The Pho broth was delicious, generous amounts of chicken and the usual veggies--nice and fresh. The tofu rolls with peanut sauce fresh and delicious.  We liked it so much we order additional food to take home. We ordered Lemongrass chicken. Nice taste and spiced just as I like it.   The waiter was polite and attentive.  Water glasses filled promptly.  We were looking for a pho restaurant but didn't want to go to the one we went to before which ironically was this one under another name (Tu Do).  This place will make it if all you Yelpers take heed and patronize them so they can stay in business and we will all enjoy a great vietnamese restaurant.  Has anyone had the pork sandwich here yet?  I'd like some feedback on it.  Enjoy!

Phuong Dong is not the place it used to be.   I will say all the nice things first.   1.  Super clean.  Even the tray of condiments on the table were absolutely spotless like human hands have never touched them.  I like clean. 2.  Attentive Service:  Menus brought promptly and water glasses filled--with lime yet.  3.  I enjoyed the tofu rice paper rolls so much so that we brought home an extra order.  Large, fresh, crisp with a nice peanuty sauce. Here's what's no so good: 1.  The fried tofu with vegetables & fried noodles did not have enough tofu.  Would paying extra gotten me extra tofu?  I would have rolled with that.   2.  The beef with vegetables and noodles only had shavings of beef and not enough of them to boot.  It was more like having a vegetarian dish-- which is not a bad thing in itself but I ordered a beef dish.... Where's the beef??? (remember that TV commercial?)  When I order a beef dish I want at least pieces of beef to sate my appetite.  Not so here.  And BTW, I wouldn't call it a tasty dish either.   3.  The chicken pho did not have a flavorful broth as in the past.  It did indeed have enough chicken and to their credit the chicken was not overcooked. But it was not an enjoyable pho.   4.  We were overcharged on one menu item because they had not updated their menu.  And is that my fault?   The price is the price on the menu even though we did pay the higher price only because this seems to be a family run place and I didn't want to shortchange them.  But, if it had been in a chain restaurant, I would have insisted on paying the price indicated in the menu. So there you have it,  too little beef, too little tofu, unflavorful dishes & pho broth, incorrect prices on the menu.  This does not warrant the 5 and 4 stars that many yelpers have given this place including myself one year ago.  But a year ago is a year ago and this is now.  When I go out to eat I want DELICIOUS food not EH food.  I am not an asian cook but a good cook I am and I have made many fantastic asian dishes on my own.  The only problem with that is that if I keep making great dishes at home, hubby will NEVER take me out to dinner!!!   I'll never see the light of day!  As it is, he prefers my food to restaurant food and that is not a good thing  (ladies, you know what i'm talking about).  We do Saturday nights out and sometimes we do one more night out.  Besides being a cheap-o, hubby adores my food but as I said before, that is not necessarily a good thing.  So as my review comes to an end (finally, right?) I can only give Phuong Dong two stars:  cleanliness, service and the tofu rolls---Nope, can't do three or I would be misleading my fellow Yelpers.

Had two double char burgers with cheese and one without with raw onion (usually comes with caramelized onions), sweet potato fries and regular fries.  Both burgers were amazingly good and fresh.  The sweet potato fries are some of the best, but the regular fries were nothing to write home about.  On the fries they need to take a lesson from Smashburger--their smash fries are really, really good.   The cooks made a mistake on one of the burgers and management more than made up for it.  Great manager!!  This is a place that I would return to over and over again.  I  suggest to the management to come up with a better substitute for the mundane french fries.  Otherwise, The Habit Burger Grill is a hit!!!!!

IHOP has nothing to worry about.  That's where I tend to go to breakfast when I want a good quality breakfast for an average to good price.  However, on Sunday they tend to have long lines and a long wait.  So I chose "The Egg I am" as a second choice.  Never been there before so I tried it.   Ordered The whole wheat pancake that came with two eggs and two strips of bacon.  The poached eggs came with some water on the dish so I soaked it up with a napkin.  Bacon was good, not too salty.  The whole wheat pancake was uneventful.  I don't know what I disliked about it the most but I would never order it again and it doesn't light a candle to IHOP's Harvest Grain whole wheat pancakes.  OOPs, did i mention IHOP again?   Hubby, who always watches his svelte figure, decided that he didn't want anything that came with meats--so he went as an "independent" so to speak---a la carte as they say in the restaurant business.  He wanted two eggs scrambled, rye toast, and home fries.  Sorry, no home fries here (he loves home fries---his heart must have been broken, but he didn't say a word because "Eggs I am" was my choice) .  Did I tell you IHOP makes excellent home fries?? Oops. They offered him Ranch potatoes instead.  What the H... are those, we wondered and soon found out.  Ranch potatoes are these pale cubes of tasteless potatoes.   Couldn't you put a crisp on those potatoes on the grill right before you are going to serve them to your clients who got out of bed, brushed their teeth, showered, combed their hair, got dressed, and gassed up the car just to get to you for breakfast on a Sunday morning????????  BTW, Mr. Slim and Trim (hubby) asked for the scrambled eggs to be made dry --meaning no butter.  So when they arrived, I asked if I could taste them.  And then the revelation:  These tasted like an egg mix not real eggs.  Just like they do in Las Vegas buffets.... they have a mix that they add water to and voila scrambled eggs.  We asked Carol our waitress and she said they were fresh eggs.  Deny, deny, deny.  I have tasted these "paste" eggs before and I can tell the difference.  Hubby poured a bunch of jalapeño hot sauce on the eggs and was able to eat them with his toast.  Did we say toast?  The definition of toast is that bread is darkened on both sides.  This rye bread did not enter the crevices of any working toaster.  It was so light that I asked him if he wanted real toast, but hubby being the gentlemen that he is said that the toast was OK.  Do we go out to have food that is OK???  I can make better than OK food (at least for breakfast).  This is why standards in restaurants go downhill because people like Mr. Slim and Trim say it is OK.   To top off the experience, I checked the bill and it had other items added to it.  Did I have iced tea?  Nope.  Did I have coffee? Nope.  Nothing like a padded bill to top off a bad breakfast.  Oh, excuse me.  I don't want Mr. Slim and Trim to be offended---an OK breakfast.

I have purchased many sandwiches from this Capriotti's location, specifically,  I love the Italian Combo.  I am writing to apologize to Capriotti's for my unfaithfulness.    Today I was on 33rd Street and Bell shopping at Harbor Freight with my husband and saw a place called Jimmy John's.  I had heard that they were also a sandwich shop and competitors to Capriotti's.  So despite the fact that I adore Capriotti's sandwiches, I strayed.  I bought Jimmy John's version of Capriotti's italian combo.  I asked for it with hot peppers just as I do at Capriotti's.  When I started to eat it at home, I noted that I did not like the texture of the bread.  I also noted that the amount of cold cuts was much less than Capriotti's not to mention the fact that it was missing the all important pepperoni.  Capriotti's sandwich has ham that has a black pepper crust around it as well making it super delicious.  Jimmy John's did give me hot peppers, but all in all I did not enjoy the sandwich from JJ's.    I was unfaithful Capriotti's.  Forgive me.I succumbed to the closeness of the Jimmy John's store, intoxicated by the fact that the sandwich was cheaper, by the niceness of the employees and by the fact that I didn't have to wait for my sandwich.  I was wrong.  I should have been more faithful, more disciplined, less impulsive.  Forgive me Capriotti's--- I will never do this again!!!! I shall be faithful from now on.

Wednesday, August 20th was a sad day for me.  The sandwich shop which I adored and the sub that I worshipped are no longer what they used to be.  Bought two cold italian combos  and took them home to hubby.  We were going to watch a special TV show and really enjoy ourselves with our sandwiches and beers.  Upon unraveling the sandwiches from the wrapper, we noticed that the cold cuts, formerly thinly sliced were thickly sliced-- so unappealing.  Being from the east coast, the mantra at the deli was always:  "Slice it thin".  The layers and layers of thin cold cuts and cheese made it so delectable.   I  also noticed that the cappicola was almost non-existent.  The lettuce was overdressed such that the bread was soaked wet  by the time I got home.  The tomatoes were like cardboard  so I threw them away (I hate throwing out food-it's unholy but I just couldn't eat them).  Hubby was so disgusted with the sandwich that he wouldn't eat it (neither would I for that matter) .  I ended up cooking and the next day I threw out the sandwiches which I had refrigerated in the hopes that they would somehow improve over time.   So here I am, knowing that I'll never have a Capriotti sandwich like the one they used to make and which had me looking forward to every bite. What happened Capriotti?????

First time @ Lash.  Found it to be a welcoming environment.  Very peaceful, nicely decorated surroundings made he feel like I had known this family forever. (It is a family owned and operated place)   Lawrence did a magnificent job and was very cordial and friendly throughout the process of my service.   I definitely will be returning.  Glad I found them!

Based on all the Yelp reviews that I read, I decided to take a ride to Kabob & Kurry. Those of you who have read my reviews know that I don't mince words.  It is what it is.  So here is what I have to say about K&K: Distance:  a little far from my house, but that is my problem Decor:  Very simple, but nicely done. Cleanliness:  Excellent from all appearances (although I did not check the kitchen) Bathroom:  Very, very clean (good indicator of the place) Service:  Very friendly. The server offered us water several times and came to see if we liked the food. Food: The buffet had a variety of middle eastern and Pakistani dishes that were kept well stocked.  And the taste of the food was: DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS. That is all I have to say:  DELICIOUS! Did I say DELICIOUS???? But of course I said, DELICIOUS. You have to get to this DELICIOUS buffet and try it for yourself.   As for the YELP rating... How do I give a place 10 stars?   I will be back because as I said to you before, it was: DELICIOUS!

I was sooooo looking forward to a great review considering that I visited Zaidi's Grill because of Yelp's reviews.  The people couldn't be nicer so I wish that I had better news.  I wanted beef samosas but they didn't make them anymore.  The chicken patty is also no longer made.  They had pakora's but I don't want vegetables battered and fried. (I'll eat my calories at Hagen Daaz thank you.)  My eating partner had the chicken boti which comes a la carte but they added about a half a cup of rice as a bonus.  Very nice.  We had the roti which was puffy but nothing to write home about.  I had a beef dish (can't remember name)  that consisted of a piece of beef with a sauce that seemed to have file(fee-lay) powder in it --the stuff they use in New orleans to thicken Gumbo.  First, I had to scoop out about 8 tablespoons of oil from the top of the dish onto another dish.  I spent some time doing this so much so that the owner realized what I was doing.  He politely assured me that it was only vegetable oil (as opposed to butter, I guess). I told him that I really didn't want the calories of the oil (also concerned about stomach's reaction to so much fat, but I didn't say this to him).  So all in all, my eating partner had an average meal and I ending up packing the meal and frankly I don't know what I am going to do with it.  By the way, they served a very tasty hot sauce which is house made.  As I said before, the owner/server could not have been nicer.  I was so disappointed considering I adore this type cuisine.  Wish I could have had a better experience.  By the way, there was no one in the dining room on a Friday night.  Not a good sign.

Loved the ambiance, loved the food- particularly their coconut crusted stuffed calamari.  This appetizer is heaven.  Sea bass ceviche is delicious, goat cheese balls, mushrooms tacos, guacamole and black beans with pepitas.  All good.   Margaritas were good and strong.  Had a great time at the Yelp event hosted by SOL.  I just can't get that stuffed calamari out of my mind........  Perhaps I won't even sleep tonight thinking about it...... Yup.  A strong possibility.

Just there.  Had the mixed grill.  There were two of us.  Mixed grill came with two skewers of lamb kabob, two skewers of chicken kabobs, flavorful brown basmati rice, chopped salad.  This portion was too much for two people but it didn't stand in the way of us finishing it.  We tried one beef and one chicken samosas.  It was a draw.  I liked the beef, hubby liked the chicken.  We had baklava and firni for dessert.  Everything was fantastic.  I will definitely go back. Thanks to yelpers who lead me to this place.   Congrats to the staff who did their best to fill all the orders even on a busy Saturday night.  The place was packed.

These people just get better and better.  Had a wonderful dinner here consisting of chicken kabobs, lamb kabobs and their accompanying brown rice.  But this is not the "Brown" rice that we are used to getting in Chinese restaurants.  This is a superbly seasoned basmati type rice that has an amazingly delicious flavor and consistency.  The dishes were accompanied by a wonderful light salad of chopped cucumbers & tomatoes.  The dressing was a cilantro based, yogurt type dressing but clearly spiked with jalapeños.  I liked it because I enjoy spicy food.  But those of you who don't like spiciness should be cautious.  The service was attentive but not overbearing.  This is a family restaurant and one of the sons who is a senior in high school took care of us.  What a delightful young man!  The meals are also a great value.  Large portions and really, really fair prices. We really would eat here more often if we weren't so far away from them.  Will definitely make an effort to give them our business.

Fantastic Food as usual!   Had the 19.99 platter with 4 Kabobs, rice and salad.  Hubby and I had enough to take home.  Also bought Firni dessert to take home.  Anyone who hasn't tried them should!

Dropped by a week ago to find updated decor, new menus, but the same wonderful attentiveness by the staff.  Did I tell you this is a family operation??  Anyway, the menu items have gone up by a few cents but that should not deter anyone.  This place just can't get anything wrong!  We had the delicious lamb and chicken kabobs, spicy rice and salad.  Just Fabulous.  It's one of those restaurants that just gets better and better.  I don't know how they do it, but they do.   Thanks for the wonderful meals, guys.

Wanted to treat visiting granddaughter to japanese teppanaki meal.  She had been to Benihana's in Scottsdale and while we had a good experience there, I wanted to surprise her with a new place. Spent over an hour checking out Yelp reviews and came up with Osaka in Mesa.  Had fairly good reviews and a nice drive never hurt anybody.  So instead of driving 5 miles to Benihana, I drove 20 miles to Osaka.    Environment:  Osaka is less dingy, more brightly lit and cleaner than Benihana.  The Soup:  Miso type soup with mushrooms.  It was more of a holograph of mushrooms.  Not bad tasting but not good either.  Not hot, lukewarm.  Benihana wins on their wonderful hot soup.   Salad:  Iceberg lettuce, one grape tomato, one slice of cucumber.  About the same size as Benihana's but Benihana's ginger dressing is delicious.  Osaka's dressing does not have a flavorful ginger dressing.  Kind of blah.   Condiments/Sauces:  Benihana serves a wonderful, strong mustardy sauce along with a ginger based sauce.  Osaka served a Ranch dressing type of sauce and a diluted, sweet ginger sauce.  Benihana wins.    Food Preparation:  Osaka seems to be off on the order in which food is prepared.  Fried Rice was done first so everyone had fried rice on their plates.  One couple who had a toddler with them ( parents paid for a kiddie meal which I will never understand why), ended up with a portion of fried rice which was twice the size of my teenage granddaughter's portion.  Literally.  Does that make sense?   The chef  then put on the meats, fish and shrimp.  Cooked steak for those who ordered steak and served it to them.  My granddaughter who specifically asked for "bloody" and emphasized rare steak, ended up with medium to medium-well steak.  Does one send steak back at a Teppanaki table service?  I wanted to but my granddaughter did not want to create a fuss.  What a nice temperament.  I would not have been so nice.  So now everyone has fried rice and steak on their plate and I have only fried rice and the shrimp entree I ordered has not been served to me.  The shrimp are sitting on the grill while the chef does a few tricks including cleaning portions of the grill which had scallop residue on it.  Yes, please, go ahead and clean your grill.  I can wait some more.  I can graze on the fried rice and the ridiculous sauces you served with it.  I asked him if I was ever going to get my shrimp. And suddenly a light bulb went off and he realized I was the only one with just rice.  So I am served my shrimp but only after everyone got their 2 shrimp appetizer on their plates first.  Did I say appetizer?  Doesn't an appetizer come first such as before the fried rice which was getting cold on our plates while the chef did his endless number of tricks??? I'm for the tricks don't get me wrong.  I'm no scrooge.  But you can't keep me from having anything substantive on my plate while you do your tricks and everybody else is eating their fried rice and steak.  He finally puts shrimp on my plate.  Hot shrimp, cold fried rice.  Oh, did I forget to tell you that the veggies haven't been prepared yet?  Oh, yeah. Go ahead.  Serve the vegetables at the end.  Alone.  After we have eaten our rice and protein.  Are vegetables a dessert so that's why they are served at the end and served  Overdone like mush?.  Benihana knows how to present food in such an order that everyone is eating their dish at the same time.  They serve the soup, salad, then the standard shrimp appetizer, veggies (while the meat/fish is cooking) and fried rice.  All lovely like a ballet.  No ballet at Osaka, more like breakdance on the D train in NYC.

Last night I tried Bawarchi, a little hole -in- the wall, fairly new place on Bell Road.  The place is clean and attractive and has a reasonably priced menu.  We saw that most of the clientele was ethnic so it reasoned that the food would be good.  We started out with two meat samosas made with ground lamb (3.99.)  Not greasy and full of meat flavored beautifully with fragrant spices. Enjoyed it very much. They were accompanied by coriander chutney and a tamarind/spicy mixture. Don't know what that was.  We also had Chicken Vindaloo (6.99), Chicken Biryani, Lamb chops and naan.  The Chicken biryani was accompanied by lentils and yogurt. The yogurt was amazing as were the lentils whose flavor profile included coconut.  The lamp chops serving was ample but the lamb was chopped into pieces.  My eating partner said they tasted good.  The vindaloo was very good although not as spicy as I had asked them to make it. Restaurants are afraid to add too much spice until they get to know you.  Everything was great until I decided to order the Kheer (1.00) for dessert.  I like my Kheer with raisins and I asked if it had raisins to which they answered yes.  No raisins in the Kheer but I found it to be very strange (at least for me), I have never ever had Kheer with noodles in it. Meaning, Kheer which is a rice pudding is usually made with basmati rice. Well this one had noodles as well and I I did not enjoy it.  Since it costs only $1, I did not make a fuss. If I had paid over $3, I would have returned it to them.  When I got up to pay for the Kheer (because we had already paid our bill), the owner did not want to charge me for the Kheer. (Maybe he read my mind or my stomach) . I resisted the temptation (not to pay) and insisted the owner take his money.  (I DO want them to stay in business!)    It is a family run business and it shows.  I don't have a problem eating off of paper plates with plastic utensils, if this bothers you, this is not the place for you. By the time we left at 8:30PM, the restaurant was almost full of patrons. Obviously, the word has gotten out that there is good food to be had here. Seeing all the indian families eating there is further proof that the food must be seasoned and prepared authentically.  I thought so.  We really, really enjoyed our meal Bawarchi minus the Kheer.

Ordered a Chicken Vindaloo for takeout.  When I got home, it was in a small container which was mostly sauce--maybe 4 slivers of chicken.  It came with rice but I will tell you that I will never do this again.  It wasn't enough to eat even as a lunch.  So disappointed.   I was a fan.

These people have everything and if they don't, they get it for you.  Tonight I was looking for 10 W 40 Synthetic Oil, 5 liter container.  Found one on sale but they only had the10 W 30, and 50, etc but no 40.  So the guy on let me take 5 separate liters (not on sale) for the price of the one 5 liter container (on sale).  Wasn't that great!!!  Some places know how to keep a customer.... And they've got ME!!!!!!!!!     Great place to get your auto needs.

I don't know how many people have given this place 5 stars but I am going to.  I had the Tofu Pho tonight and it was delicious.  I couldn't believe the number of pieces of tofu they gave me, but even more incredible was the broth.  A very good broth infused with star anise flavor.  Noodles, bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, fresh basil, and lime all added to this amazing broth made my trip to this casino well worth it.  So if you can't win at the tables, try a table at Star Ginger and eat any of the Phos they offer (chicken, beef and tofu) and you will be indeed a winner.  Saw the mongolian beef which looked amazing.  I will try that out next time.  A 5 star rating for a food court spot in a casino?  You Betcha!

Had the temporarily available "HOBOKEN" sandwich.  East coast girl goes for East Coast italian sandwiches.  The meats were freshly sliced before my eyes and true to form I picked all the add-on's.  But first I had to pick the bread.  Lots of choices nowadays at these sandwich shops.  I picked Ciabatta because it is a rustic kind of bread that goes fantastically well with italian cold cuts.  Well, when I sunk my teeth into the ciabatta bread at home, it was not quite what I expected in the bread.  Ciabatta is rustic, with holes in it, crunchy on the outside, resistant to the tooth(a little bit).  This was not your typical ciabatta.  I imagine they made it at Blimpie so it is not the same as baked in a bakery.  Just don't call it Ciabatta--called it Italian bread or something but when you say Ciabatta you raise your customers' expectations.  Other than that I was happy with my 6" Hoboken at under $5.  Can't be beat.  Service was quick and easy.

First time at CHOP and it did not disappoint.  Had two salads which contained a variety of greens, croutons and bacon in a champagne vinaigrette.  Very nice and they customized hubby's salad by omitting the bacon.  Do you know anyone who omits bacon on anything?  We ordered two baseball sirloins which came with a full-sized (and I mean full) loaded baked potato.  I didn't find the potatoes to be that loaded.  It had sour cream, butter, chives and bacon.  What I was missing was a little more bacon if you are going to call it loaded.  As usual, hubby asked for the potato to be naked--nothing on it.  Yes, plain.  He chose a plain potato over a loaded potato.  Do you sense  aberrant behavior here?  Is it time for the men and/or women in white coats to put him into a white van and take him to a place where the decor is mostly white (well, it used to be).  Now they add color for the benefit of the patients.  To go on, the sirloins were perfectly cooked as individually requested. Even hubby's blood rare steak came out blood rare.  Of course, he thought that it could have been rarer.  Not so.  But then again vampires are never satisfied.   The service was good mostly provided by well-groomed, attractive, really young ladies who did not miss a beat.   Water glasses filled and on their toes.  Thank you ladies.  By the time we left close to 8PM, the place was packed.  It seems I am not the only one who likes CHOP.

Waiting to see Billy Joel, but needed a quick snack.  Walked around and saw this place. Asked some of the people eating on the patio how their sandwich was.  Answer: Good! Sandwiches are listed and as you are on line a young lady comes by with a tablet asking you what type of sandwich you want and on what kind of bread.  I chose multi-grain. Technologically efficient and impressive.  As you walk along on the line you are faced with choices---the refrigerator beckons you to a drink,  a cookie jar flaunts itself and asks you to take one, and the display of all kinds of chips begs you to be bad for the day.  But I was good.  I ordered the "italian" which includes provolone cheese, pepperoni, cappicola, and I believe some ham... who remembers.... but it all sounded good.  When I arrived at the sandwich making station, all I had to do was tell them the add on's.  Mine were:  hot peppers, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles  oil and italian seasoning.  Once my sandwich was in the bag, I noted that the sandwich was warm.  I took it out to eat it on the patio and I said: Oh, no.  NOT a Heated, COLD CUTS sandwich!! and then....I took one bite.  What a delicious sandwich!!! and how crunchy it was with all those add on's.  Potbelly, I forgive you for heating up my sandwich. Won't you do it again, sometime?   Did I tell you guys how lovely and friendly EVERYONE was at this place.  It was like dying and going to heaven---Food and otherwise.

We bought a Groupon because this restaurant was close by.  We usually go to the west side on Bell and 24th avenue where the food and service are both top-notch. Okay, we entered Karaikudi at about 6:30 and were not served our dinners until after 7. No excuse. The place wasn't that crowded.  Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Biriyani with paratha bread.  Made a point of NO BUTTER on the Paratha.  Both dinners were ordered spicy.  The vindaloo had a nice taste but the spiciness was lacking.  The biriyani had a nice level of spiciness and the chicken was tasty without being overdone. Bad part --- Ifound the rice part a bit too salty.  Never experienced this in other restaurants.  The paratha came with enough grease to lube a car.  The waiter insisted that he said "no butter" and, in fact took it back to the kitchen to confirm that no butter had been used. He brought back the same sample and stuck by his claim that no butter was used. "oil was used for the oven.  All paratha is made like that."  Maybe this is true of Karaikudi but certainly not at all other  indian places we have frequented.  We refused the paratha.  The waiter brought us nan as a substitute, which was fine and dry as we originally ordered.  When presented with the bill, we were told that $10 is added to the Groupon total --- as specified by the owner, not by Groupon.  We refused to pay the additional $10.  The waiter  made a phone call, probably to the owner and the bill was totaled correctly.   We paid with a credit card and below the total we wrote out this total in words so as not to be scammed with any changes. (we learned of how tip amounts were altered after reading other reviews of  Karaikudi.)  Other people who gave this place 4 and 5 stars may have had a delightful dining experience.  We did not and will not be returning. Instead, we'll drive to Mayuri Palace on Bell at 24th avenue and enjoy delicious food, prompt and courteous service and at less expensive prices.

A yearning for a chargrilled burger led me to find Smashburger.  Although  not charcoal grilled, I ordered "The Classic" which turned out to be  one of the tastiest burger I have had in a while.  Served on a tray with themed paper, it was adorned with fresh lettuce, tomato, Smash-sauce, pickles, cheese,  and red onions sliced really thin.  Really juicy and tasty.  The regular fries I ordered were thin, crispy with a sprinkling of salt.  My granddaughter had the Smash-fries which were garnished with rosemary, garlic and olive oil. These were incredible.  I had to steal some away from her.  The service is quick and friendly---Pay first, find your table and then they find you.  The only negative was a nasty wasp annoying us since we sat outside on such a beautiful day.  All in all it is a great value for a great meal.  We will be back....

What a great thing to have fellow Yelpers lead you to the Nirvana of Chinese food!  With all those great 5 star reviews, we just had to try it. We arrived in time for happy hour and were able to get beers and wines for half price.  A good start.  The Modelo beer did not taste right to me and the waitress quickly changed it up willingly.  She said I should let her know if there was anything wrong with the replacement.  Good customer service.    We ordered Orange chicken, Moo-shoo pork and chicken fried rice.  The orange chicken was lightly coated with a spicy, delicious sauce--cooked perfectly.  The chicken fried rice should be called amazing fried rice.  Lots of chicken, perfect flavoring and not greasy.  The moo shoo pork was made as requested, no hoisin sauce and no sugar.  It was absolutely delicious and was accompanied by 4 crepes.  The waitress paid a lot of attention to us and answered questions about other items on the menu (we were already thinking about what we would get during our next visit)  She was so attentive that at one point, I thought she was going to join us in the booth.  The management came to the table to see if we liked our food and was just as attentive as we were leaving wishing us a good night with a great smile.   The prices are very fair ranging from $8.99- 10.99 (for seafood dishes).  Glad I didn't have to take out a loan from my 401K to eat here ( as opposed to other Scottsdale chinese restaurants who charge steakhouse prices)   This is the kind of place where you want to return because of the fairly price, delicious, well prepared food as well as the accommodating and attentive staff.

You can't imagine how thrilled I was to find that Local Dines had a coupon for my favorite restaurant that made my favorite dish incredibly well.  Ordered my usual Shrimp with Lobster NY style (with added pork) and chicken fried rice.  Immediately the waitress told me that the added pork would be an additional $2 instead of the usual $1.  She said everything has gone up.  Gas hasn't gone up, dear, and certainly pork hasn't.  But OK, charge me the extra dollar.   My dish arrived looking like scrambled eggs had been dropped into the sauce. Solid pieces of egg.  Shrimp with lobster sauce has egg in the sauce but never like this--it is subtle and delicate.  Then I took a taste.  Pure sugar.  Maybe that is an exaggeration.  But sweet enough that I spit it out.  Then I noticed the shrimp. They were cut in half.  After counting the pieces there were 8, meaning 4 actual shrimp.  Really?  Is that what restaurants do when they offer a coupon?  My sadness was the realization that whoever made those wonderful Shrimp and Lobster for me in the past is gone and clearly I will not be tasting that deliciousness again.  Sadness.  After the taste, I called the waitress over to complain about the dish.  She knows me well enough that she was surprised as this was my go-to dish at this restaurant.  It used to be delicious.  Not today.  I asked her for a menu to re order and when I said I wanted beef with mushroom sauce she said this too would be sweet because brown sauce is sweet.  Not always, I thought.  But I went with her recommendation of shrimp with vegetables in a white sauce.  Upon the dish's arrival I tasted the shrimp.  Or shall I say the half shrimp.  There was the sweetness again.  Sweet in not a good way.  Oh, I get it.  How stupid was I!  There they were! The same shrimp that were taken off the first dish that I rejected were back on my plate with a different sauce.  How clever my waitress was to persuade me to get another shrimp dish.  Makes sense to me now.  They recycled the shrimp I didn't like in the first dish and fed it to me one way or the other in the second dish.  Except for one thing --I couldn't eat them either.  The waitress came by and asked me about the substitute dish and I told her that it appeared as if the shrimp had been transferred from one dish to another.  She didn't deny it.  She answered: "But, it's EDIBLE, right?"    So sad that one of my favorite Chinese restaurants has resorted to serving incorrectly prepared food, half-sized, cut up shrimp to save money and recycling the rejected food of a patron.   I dread the thought that it might be  even worse than I thought.  The shrimp that were served to me could have been from one of the leftover plates from the birthday party guests who were leaving just as I sat down.  Ugh!

Delicious food.  Garlicky mofongo with nicely fried pork to go with it.  The alcapurrias were delicious but small.  I am deducting one star for running out of chicken which my husband wanted since he doesn't eat pork or shrimp.   Good service.   Good luck guys on the restaurant.  I had not been there since the prior place closed up.  I see you haven't missed a step.   Will go back soon.

Had a lunch special today as a takeout.  I couldn't believe the prices of the lunch specials starting at 5.95 for:  choice of dish, choice of rice, egg roll and soup.  There were also specials in the 6.95 and 7.95 pricing depending on what you wanted to eat.  For the 5.95 that I selected, I had  shredded pork with dried tofu. The died tofu intrigued me as I had never had it before.  I asked that it be made spicy.  My choice of rice was brown rice which is usually up charged in chinese restaurants.  Not here.  I also got the egg drop soup and an egg roll with the order.  Despite great value on this meal and the generosity of the portion, I would not have called the dish tasty.  Usually pork dishes taste really good.  There was some spiciness as requested but it was made spicy by using hot szechuan oil which made the dish quite a bit greasy.  The egg roll and egg drop soup were fine, but nothing to write home about.  I hope that restaurants in the Chinese Cultural Center up their game.  They should be serving some of the best Chinese food in Phoenix.

Like Pavlov's dogs, my husband and i headed over to Miu's after we read the review in The New Times.  As many have said,  the place is in an iffy neighborhood but that never deters people like us and obviously other Yelpers either.  We entered through a door in the back located in the  parking area (as opposed to having an entrance facing the street).  Upon entering we noted that the decor was sparse if non existent (we don't eat decor!) but more importantly the place looked clean.    We started with the Hot and Sour soup made with tofu instead of the usual pork.  The soup portion was generous and delicious worthy of 5 stars.  We both ate and still brought some leftovers home--at 5.95, a great value. My hubby ordered the water boiled fish which got rave reviews in the New Times article and by other Yelpers.   But as others have said,  the wait staff has a bit of a problem with English and so it took a bit to find out the kind of fish it was.  According to the cook, it was sole.  When it arrived it was in a bowl with broth and swimming in a red oil.  So we began to scoop out the oily top and finally decided it was easier to move the fish and the veggies to a plate and eat it from there.  The fish was delicately cook and the veggies had some flavor but nothing to write home about.  He ate it but I didn't hear the usual oo's and ah's when he really likes something.  He ate it in silence which usually means, I ordered it so I have to eat it.  He ordered it at my suggestion since some people seems to enjoy it in the newspaper review but I guess all palates are not the same.  Next time I'll keep my "gills" shut.   I ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp which took quite a while to come out.  The waitress apologized and told me that the shrimp had been frozen and needed to be defrosted.  I expect frozen seafood in a land-locked state and it is certainly better than leaving them un-defrosted in a refrigerator to rot. slowly.  So the shrimp came out in a large plate with their heads and eyes looking at me.  I was not shocked after all this is a very authentic restaurant.  There were about 11 nicely sized shrimp on the plate but they were definitely not jumbo shrimp.  They had been cooked without breading (good) but with their scales on which I removed before I ate each one.  The shrimp were properly done with some onions and peppers on the bottom of the plate.  What it was missing was ginger.  Every single chinese restaurant where I have eaten this dish (NY's Chinatown as well) puts ginger as well as salt and pepper and sautes the shrimp in the mixture. I asked for ginger and they promptly brought me some.  By the way, the "pepper" in salt and pepper shrimp was missing.  So I ate the shrimp skipping the head and the eyes.  (I'm just not that good yet!)  I would give the shrimp for freshness and value of the dish, 4 stars.   The water boiled fish and the salt and pepper shrimp were each $10.95.  I could understand the shrimp at that price but the portion of the fish was not that large and sole is not all that expensive.  I think they need to check their price points.  The prices at Mei's is almost equivalent to the pricing in Scottsdale chinese restaurants.  Considering the neighborhood, I think that the dishes may be a little overpriced. I realize that a new restaurant owner wants to re-coup his investment but too much too fast may not be a good strategy. By the way, the young owner did come by our table to find out how everything was.   Very nice and very gracious.   I think Mei's is worthy of another try.   I will be generous this time and give them 4 stars.  (The soup and the service really helped their rating)

Why is it that my frugality makes me buy online coupons that are offered to me?  I do it ALL the time--- rather successfully I might add.  It not only saves me money but introduces me to new restaurants and cuisines.  So here we go on the merry go round of Local Dines coupons---$25 worth of food for $12.50 plus a fee that Local Dines charges.  How could I go wrong with half price food.  Need you ask?  Don't you know where this is going?   An eclectic place to say the least---you really don't know what it is... mexican color decor, pool table, darts,  large bar, wall murals, interesting signage, tv's with sports on... it's a little bit of everything decor wise, but DEFINITELY NOT CHINESE- food wise.   Ordered the beef chow mein which came with "sautéed" noodles with beef, vegetables and a sauce on top.  Looked like Chinese food but when I tasted it I would not describe it as Chinese.  No asians flavors, no ginger, no soy sauce, no sesame oil---picture store-bought gravy dissolved with some chicken stock( maybe) or water with corn starch added and poured over the noodles & the beef.  If I closed my eyes, I would not have been able to discern that this beef was actually beef.  THERE WERE NO ASIAN FLAVORS TO SPEAK OF IN THIS DISH.  When the waitress came by and asked about the food, I told her how I felt about the food.  She (Kloe) graciously offered to give me something else.  How nice of her!  (That is the reason for one of the stars above.) I took another chance with Beef with Peanut sauce.  In the meantime, hubby was eating his orange chicken made without the breading.  He liked it because it was spicy enough but he too thought the "chicken" was weird tasting.  Give him spice and he's alright.  How mundane.  How trite.  Spiciness does not make a dish taste good.  It can only enhance it if it's good already.  DO I HEAR AN 'AMEN"?   So I get the beef with peanut sauce and all I can say is that at least it reminded me of something asian--thai peanut sauce although not as good.  She gave me plenty of white rice with it which I did not eat.  "Vacuum-cleaner hubby" helped me finish my plate.   My mother taught me to always say something nice and here it goes.  They have an amazing array of all types of beers--some brands I never even heard of.  I had an Abita which was lemony and on special  (yay! yay! another bargain!!! $2.75).  Hubby had the stout which was served in a small brandy glass and he got charged $6.50-- not a full brandy glass either.  Can't win.   Here's what I found out about this restaurant:  One of the owners is Hawaiian (that makes him somewhat Asian);  The chef is Chinese from Portugal (that's semi-asian in my book), there are white cooks and mexican cooks in the kitchen.  Nice diversity BUT I WANT MY CHINESE FOOD COOKED BY CHINESE CHEFS... DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THAT????????? I WANT IT TO TASTE LIKE CHINESE FOOD!  I want it to be delicious, I want ginger in it, I want that subtle taste of sesame oil, I want some soy sauce, I want some hot chinese mustard,  I want it, I want it, I want to eat good chinese food!!!!   Unfortunately THIS IS NOT IT.  Don't even think it.   Here's what it is. It is a bar with a cool vibe decor-wise.  It has amazing beers.  The servers are nice--at least Kloe was.  They have multiple televisions to watch what you want.  Come in to this place, have some beers maybe some egg rolls (can they screw those up too???) and then go to a real chinese restaurant if you want Chinese food.  Chop & Wok,  why don't you serve some delicious sliders?  Those are more up your alley.

Looked clean.  No wait. Great Eyebrows. $8.    I'm happy.  BTW, it is an iffy neighborhood.  I was in there maybe 7 minutes and when I came out, someone had poured a cola drink all over my windshield and front/sides of car.  I noticed the windshield and wiped it clean, but it was not till the next day that I noticed the cola all over the hood and sides.  Nasty thing to do to a luxury car.  Maybe the fact that people actually save up for a car of their choice annoys some people but I do believe in Karma.  So here I am, waiting for the karma to kick in.  It will.  "G--d Don't like ugly."

Traveled a bit to get here but wanted to give this place a chance.  What a great idea that was!!!  Chicken Vindaloo, basmati rice and chicken biryani--- ALL delicious and cooked to order as we requested.  The portions were generous as well.  Food was not greasy and most flavorful.  We like spicy dishes and we got them.  Most places are afraid of making them spicy when you request it.  This is NOT to say that people who are cautious of spiciness can't get what they want.  The service was friendly and attentive.  I can't complain about a thing.  BTW, I don't rate on decor so people who don't like their decor aren't into really good serious indian food.  This was REALLY, REALLY, good indian food priced lower than most indian restaurants.  The basmati rice was included with the entree while most indian restaurants don't.  Other restaurants make you order rice separately to jack up the bill.   I am definitely going back to enjoy what was probably the best indian food in a long time.

The last time I was here was in December.  I thought the food was spectacular.  Today, three months later, not so much.  Had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag.  Asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy.  There is another local restaurant that does this for me.  Well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless.  I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy.  So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous.  The basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush.  The chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough.  However, it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices.  Everything was freshly made that has to be said.  The waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the "sambar?"when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food)   It was lentils in a tomato base.  Really good.   The waitress was very polite, attentive and just an overall nice young lady.   I am so disappointed in the food this time around though.  I know this cannot be the same chef who made our food the last time.  The bad thing about the restaurant business is the movement of chefs and staff.  Here today, gone tomorrow.  Today was a case where the former chef was greatly missed by us.  I don't think I would make another trip out to 24th Avenue and Bell to eat this indian food.  I thought I had found a gem, but sadly this is not the case.  Management:  Work on your food... who was cooking in December that made my first visit so great???

I discovered this market which has lots of ethnic products, mainly for preparing indian dishes.  Bought a few items at bargain prices.  When was the last time you paid 79 cents a pound for fresh ginger?   Also, Dates, coriander chutney, garlic  etc.  They have an extensive frozen food department for everything you want to eat but don't know how to make.  Even indian ice cream is sold, albeit a bit expensive on this item ($7.99 a pint).   What's interesting about this market is that they have various areas where they sell other things.  They have a snack bar where some basic indian foods are sold.  I think I only saw vegetarian items if I recall.  They have another area for eyebrow threading, a small boutique for saris and other indian attire, jewelry, etc.  They even sell altars.  How diverse.  I enjoyed shopping here not only because the prices are reasonable but because they have so many items to choose from.  Try the place if you are in the area.

We tried out this place because of the positive Yelp ratings.  And who doesn't want to try out a new italian place?  It was packed on Saturday night and for the life of me I didn't think this was the kind of place that required reservations.  Someone had told me it was a little, family owned hole-in-the-wall that served good italian food.  So we had to wait for a table for about 15 minutes--not too bad.  It took a while to order because the place was really packed but we were quite patient.  Ordered chicken parm with angel hair plus one combination chicken & eggplant with rigatoni.  The server told us it would be a while so we were ready for a wait.  We were provided a basket with two small rolls and butter.  They were really, really crispy & delicious.  ( I overheard someone at another table saying that they make their own bread.)  We added olive oil to our dishes and dunked the rolls for a yummy experience.  We were hoping they would bring more since a previous reviewer said that they keep the bread and water coming but such was not the case.  We were too polite to ask for more and perhaps that was a mistake.   While waiting we noticed that people bring their own wines and get charged a small corkage fee.  Good idea.  Maybe next time.  We chit chatted and chit chatted anxiously awaiting our food.  Plates came and went but not our dishes.  When the waitress said it would take a while, she wasn't kidding.  Alas, after one hour, (yes, one hour) our food arrived looking mighty beautiful.  (too bad I didn't take a photo).  A mound of chicken with sauce and cheese alongside some beautiful looking pasta.  Tasted the pasta first to try the sauce and it was great---not too sweet and not too vinegary--a nice fresh taste especially with the freshly chopped parsley on it.  The chicken was thicker than most as it was not really a cutlet, but it was perfectly cooked with a crunchy outer crust.  I was happy.  Hubby was enjoying his as well and after such a long wait I was really relieved that he was loving his food.  However, there is one issue that I have to bring up despite the loveliness of the food.  Keep in mind that this is a small place with an open kitchen.  Diners are literally a few feet away from the kitchen operation.  The clanging of the clean dishes being stacked,  the dropping of large utensils and the throwing of pots when cooks are not happy with each other is NOT a good thing.  They have to figure out how to disagree in the kitchen without throwing pots and without certain words being used.  We are very upbeat and flexible people, but it got to the point where we couldn't really enjoy the meal because of the excessive kitchen noise.  I'm not talking about diners having a good time who get louder and louder the more wine they drink.  No, no.  People enjoying their food and wine is to be expected.  But what should be contained is the kitchen noise.  There has to be a way of placing dishes whereby you don't feel that every dish in the place has crashed to the floor.   Figure it out guys.  Have your differences after the customers leave 'cause we really loved your food and want to come back.   Looking forward to our next meal with you with just a little less noise.   Thanks.

Dropped by and was really impressed by the place.  I usually go to Talking Stick in Scottsdale so I thought that this place would not be up to par with Talking Stick.  I was wrong.  Attractive Fire and water features on the outside, clean inside, active casino.  Light smoke scent but not too overwhelming.   Friendly environment with a nice Food court.  Lots of choices.  Go there!

I am totally confused about this place.  The doors facing Northsight are locked but yet have an "open" sign.  Saw 4 asian guys playing some sort of game on a table and they saw me but didn't open the door.  I went around to the door  on the other side which was open.  NO ONE was eating there.  The young lady at the cash register seemed to be shocked to see a customer.  The place had the smell of raw sewage so I didn't take a chance to eat there.  Figured that a place that smells so bad might be bad for my health.  Ate there a while back and I thought the food was good.  Something is out of whack here...  Something not good.

A fan of La Piazza in Glendale and being in Phoenix, I decided to dine at the "sister" restaurant.  Nice location, nice atmosphere.  Simple, clean decor.  The first thing I noted was that the menu is much smaller than the Glendale location.  No chicken marsala.. etc.  Ok, we accept that.  Decided to order Pizza margarita with prosciuito (extra charge).  Hubby ordered pasta puttanesca which was to include anchovies.  My pizza came out with very, very thin and scant prosciuitto.  I ordered this at the Glendale location and it was much more generous on the prosciutto.  I also recall seeing more basil on it.  It was good, but not the greatest.  The puttanesca was the star of the two dishes.  Garlicky red sauce with NOT an anchovy in sight.  The portion was small.  It was like being back in France where restaurants serve you like you are on a diet whether you want to be or not.  Flavorwise, I thought the sauce was good.  My husband's take was that the sauce was almost as good as mine (Thank you, darling).  Puttanesca sauce requires anchovies end of story and they were not there.   Although it was happy hour, our server did not offer any happy hour drinks.  We had to ask and after we did, he put a menu on the table which looked like their regular drinks list.  When we asked, he said everything was on there.  Don't most restaurants highlight what is part of the happy hour and how much it is?   I think if we were prompted, we would have imbibed some of the offerings.  Management:  you may want to let people know what the happy hour offers.  Why  don't you try offering an appetizer of the day with a signature cocktail, wine and beer of the day.  MAKE US WANT IT is what I am saying l!!!    Remember most of your customers are weak and waiting for an excuse to have a drink.   Well,  all in all, this place does NOT compare to the Glendale location.  Those of you who are giving this place rave reviews, go to the Glendale location first and then we'll talk.

Wanted to see what all the hype was about and all the great reviews (although lately some have been low).  Ordered the PRINCIPE for take out.  Waited 25 minutes which is not too bad for a Saturday night.   Principe came with sauce, mozzarella, proscuitto, topped with arugula and bits of basil.  It had some charred on the edges which is a result of the wood fired oven.  It was a good pizza but $18 for a 12 inch pizza is a bit much in retrospect.  The place has a nice buzz to it and people were dressed to the nines just to go to a pizzeria---that's Scottsdale for you.

Found this little gem of a restaurant thanks to reliable Yelpers.  My granddaughter and I shared a vacation in Paris and ever since then she has become a Francophile.  So her vacation with me here in the valley had to include something French.   The high ratings for Merci were an attraction since the last French restaurant I went to left a lot to be desired.  We decided on lunch at MERCI since they only serve dinner from Wednesday through Saturday.  MERCI is a smallish place with neatly placed tables that have plastic doilies on them--how French (not the plastic part, but the idea of doilies).  I was happy to hear beautiful French songs piped in.  French music can be so romantic regardless of what the lyrics say, but 99% of the time it is about romance.  You must realize that they would rarely do this in France-- restaurants are for eating and talking and drinking. And it can get quite boisterous, especially when they discuss politics.  Well, this is Scottsdale and I really enjoyed the music.   The waitress came over quickly and brought over what would be considered a "carafe d'eau" in France--here , a tall bottle of cold water, not a carafe as we know it.  It so reminded me of sitting down at a French bistro and having the water served in the ice cold bottle  (only if you asked for it BTW).   I ordered the French onion soup which came with a small salad.  Granddaughter ordered the Caprese salad.   The salad that came with my soup was small but delightful.  Fresh, fresh, fresh mix of greens accompanied by a side of ranch dressing which seemed more peppery than usual for a ranch.  Very delicious.  The onion soup was a tad on the salty side.  Keep in mind that I have a high tolerance for salt and yet I felt compelled to tell the waitress at the end of our meal that the chef HAS to cut down on the salt. I don't know that many people who could have eaten it.   I found that the onion soup needed to have more onions as well.  The soup had the usual floating bread with gruyere cheese.  I was happy to see that they used real gruyere and not mozzarella.  The bread needed to be more crusty to withstand its time floating inside the soup.    The Caprese Salad was a huge bowl of assorted greens with fresh mozzarella, grape tomatoes, pesto and slivers of Gruyere.  Along with the ranch dressing, granddaughter cleaned her plate.  It was a really nice salad.   As if we had not eaten enough, dessert was on our minds and what better to remind us of Paris than a Crepe with Nutella --just like the ones we ate from street vendors during our daily walks.   After ordering it, the waitress came back a few minutes later to tell us that they were OUT of crepes.  How could a French restaurant be out of crepes?  Crepes are made from a batter.  Does this mean that all the ingredients of the batter were nonexistent in the kitchen??.....OR...OR....OR, are they saying they buy pre-made crepes and just add Nutella to them.?  I can't bear the thought.  The idea of crepes is to have them freshly made, piping hot.  How disappointing.! Quelle Domage!    So we regrouped and selected the French hot chocolate made with Dark Belgian chocolate and served with whipped cream.  When I saw her eyes roll back into her head, I knew my granddaughter was totally enjoying it.  I took a teaspoon and I could understand why she was not talking and just drinking.  Really, really good hot chocolate.   Two disappointments at MERCI--the over salted broth in the onion soup and NO CREPES.  The former is excusable and forgivable.  The latter IS NOT.   You are getting 4 stars because of the French experience you gave us, the wonderful salads, and service .

It's terrible when you put a restaurant on a pedestal and then get disappointed big time.  My last review for Merci was a 4 star review based on 4 star food and service.   The first thing that we experienced was being served us a bottle of warm water and no ice in the glasses.  It was warm enough to gargle with.  What were they thinking?  Were they so overwhelmed with the birthday party that was going on (at least a group of 20) that we couldn't get cold water? I tried to distract my dining companions from this annoyance because I was getting ready for a great meal!!  I had checked out the menu on-line and knew exactly what I wanted.  I ordered the rib-eye steak with peppercorn cream sauce, medium rare.  When it arrived it was indeed medium rare but there was no char on the steak at all.  I realize that the steak was on the thin side so the idea of charring probably scared off the cook.  The steak should have been put on the grill, or pan or whatever when it was screaming hot and then give it one minute of each side and done--medium rare.  Nope.  Not so.  I ended up with a grayish looking piece of meat drowning in the cream peppercorn sauce.  Now I like peppercorn sauce as much as the next guy but this was outrageous.  Swimming in the stuff.  Let's look at the photograph please... Do you NOT agree?  In Paris they serve a similar sauce in a ramekin on the side and you get to dip your meat on the delicious sauce.  That's how it's done, folks.  I was really surprised at my drowning steak considering the chef here is from Paris.  He certainly knows how it's done.  The frites were a little on the greasy side so the dish was a bust for me.    The service was inattentive today maybe because of the birthday party they were catering and I can certainly forgive that.  However, the presentation and delivery of my rib eye steak was unforgivable.  I took it off the plate, wiped it down with THE ONE NAPKIN THEY GAVE ME, and gave it to hubby to chow down on.  So really, no dinner was had by me.   My granddaughter enjoyed the Caprese Salad and hubby ate the Smoked Salmon open sandwich.  Hence, the two stars.   A less than stellar night was had by all.

We have been using Casey for about two years now.  The pool is always in great shape because Casey is sure to balance the water perfectly.  Amazing job!  Thanks Casey.   The Gelbmans

Visiting family from the East Coast craving some Afghani food and Yelpers led me to Rania's when my go-to place was closed on Sunday.  Sometimes things happen for a reason.  The place is quite large and simply decorated with an oriental rug and a number of decorative items on the walls.   We were attended to promptly for our drink order which for the most part was a nice tall glass of water with lemon.  One of us rebelled and ordered a chocolate-stout "guinness" type beer which came in a really tall glass.  Looked amazing and it was.  Ordered Chicken Samosas that came out crispy with an ample, delicious filling of ground chicken with peas. Nice middle eastern seasonings, but not overwhelming.  Nice start.  Our orders were quite diverse:  Chicken kabob sandwich with seasoned rice; lamb kabob sandwich; Leg of Lamb kabob combo; Braised Lamb shank; Chicken Quorma.  I had the chicken kabob "nanwich" that was tasty, but the nan wrapping was too thick for my liking.  I moistened the sandwich with the coriander chutney which added a fresh, spicy taste. The seasoned rice that came with it was flavorful and nicely cooked.  Nothing worse than soggy rice but this one was cooked perfectly. The lamb Kabob sandwich was quite good and the spinach rice accompaniment got rave reviews from everyone who ordered it.  I tasted it and found that it had a hint of mint. Nice touch!  The lamb shank was a large portion, but we must remember that this lamb dish comes on a bone.  The person who ordered it was happy with his dish. The Chicken Quorma presented in a red sauce was enjoyed as well.   We ordered two desserts, Pistachio ice cream and Baklava.  Who doesn't love Baklava?  The pistachio ice cream dish came topped generously with whipped cream.  And then, the moment happened,  I delved my spoon into that pistachio ice cream which was nothing short of nirvana.  OMG.  Pistachio ice cream drizzled with rose water laden with chopped pistachios.  YES, YES. Pistachios in pistachio ice cream!  When was the last time that happened?  I mean LOTS of pistachios, not a sprinkling here and there.  Yes, Rania's ---you got me! You got me good.  I LOVED this dessert.  Then there was the Baklava--large, full of nuts and made with honey.  Yes.  I could taste the honey (not the corn syrup that most places make it with).  Another taste thrill.  Nicely done, Rania's you gave a us delightful conclusion to an overall wonderful meal experience.   Met the owner, Wally, at the tail end of our visit when we had the opportunity to chat. Such a friendly and charming individual.  It makes a difference when the owner is hands-on and is able to chat up his customers.  The tasty food and the cordiality of the owner will make me come back over and over again.  Thanks Wally.

I love Chick-fil-A food.  But this location left me wanting.  Arrived on Tuesday night and was the only person on line.  Paid at 8:21PM.  One sandwich--Spicy chicken with the multigrain bun.  Waited, waited, waited..  Young lady looking at her cell phone sharing that "he called" and constantly looking at the phone while I waited and waited.  Young people scrambling around doing this or that--anything but getting my sandwich.  Several times I was asked if I had ordered.  Finally I asked if food typically takes this long.  She said that they were getting me a fresh filet.  (As opposed to what??? an unfresh filet?  Aren't those things frozen anyway?)  Another young lady came by to ask if I wanted another type of sandwich.  No, I said, I want the spicy chicken sandwich. She offered me fries to eat while I waited.  She must have seen that I was famished.  Took me 19 minutes for one sandwich.  A sympathetic fellow customer who was watching my saga unfold, told me "They can do better than this.  They are young but they can do better.  I hope you have a better rest of the evening".  How thoughtful that this gentleman noticed and said something comforting.  In the words of that kind stranger: Yes.  As young as the staff is:  You can do better.

First time visit with a wonderful outcome. The place was empty on a Monday night so we were seated quickly and in a friendly manner. Ordered chicken vindaloo, whole wheat naan and chicken biryani. We were served complimentary papadum, cilantro chutney and tamarind sauce. Wish they had been more generous with the cilantro chutney and tamarind sauce.  They were served in tiny ramekins that barely allowed us to dip in the papadum.  The chicken biryani was delicious and as spicy as we requested. Chicken vindaloo was made without dairy as requested. The sauce had those wonderful Indian spices. The naan was the perfect complement to our dishes and helped to sop off that delicious sauce.  No room for dessert but based on food and service we will be returning real soon.

Just got back from a wonderful meal at Haweli's.  The place is spacious and the decor is attractive.  They were having a big party so they offered us tables wherever we wanted.  Some places turn you away when they are having a party.  Not Haweli, they welcomed us.   We noticed that they didn't serve us complementary papadum (lentil crackers) and accompanying chutneys & tamarind sauce that other restaurants offer.  We missed that.  As an appetizer we ordered ground beef samosas.  We were surprised as most indian restaurants don't serve beef.  The samosas were served with coriander chutney and tamarind sauce and were pretty large and tasty.  I took advantage of the presence of beef and ordered beef vindaloo.  Hubby ordered Haweli biryani which has both lamb and chicken.  Finally we ordered a whole wheat paratha without butter.  The beef vindaloo was tasty but slightly salty.  Not enough to keep me from cleaning my plate though.  A note to the chef--hold the salt on the vindaloo.  The biryani was exquisite-- perfectly cooked, plenty of meat, the meat perfectly cooked, not greasy--don't know what else to say other than perfect!  The paratha bread was tasty and came as ordered without butter.  You don't know what a problem that can be at some restaurants as they automatically put butter on bread.  All in all the meal was really good. The service was spot on.  "Datpir" was our waiter.  Our apologies because we have probably misspelled his name.  But he was attentive and answered all our questions throughout the meal.  We didn't have many because we have experience eating indian food, but  he was available none the less.  This restaurant has been open only two weeks and it promises to be a place where Scottsdale residents can enjoy good indian food.  BTW, they don't serve liquor but the serve the usual indian drinks such as mango lassie.  They have a buffet 7 days a week which we plan to partake of real soon so we can experiment with different dish.   Thanks for a great meal and much luck with your new place.

Found i2i Optique on Yelp.  Customer service is very important to me so I decided to check them out.  Sabina, the owner, was there and she was friendly and informative.  I was super impressed with the line of frames she carries, especially the French line "Face a Face."  As I spoke more and more to Sabina, I knew we were going to do business.  I tried on my usual style frames, but she was quick to tell me when a frame didn't do anything for me.  I was alone so her honest feedback was much appreciated.  She picked out a frame and voila, they really looked good on me.  I wasn't immediately sure about how they looked because they were so different from the ones I am used to.  But then I realized she was absolutely correct.  The frames shaped my face beautifully.  She definitely has an eye for the right frame--but then again she is in the business.  I have gotten nothing but compliments on my eyeglasses from EVERYBODY so I am happy that she helped me pick them out.   I plan to go back to get a pair of sunglasses.  I am certain she will find some spectacular frame for me.  Thanks Sabina.

The New Times article, "10 Best Things I ate in 2015",  Volume 46, led me to try Dinghao.  The author of the article said that their dish, "sheng jian boa" or steam buns were delicious--  broth and pork-filled buns.  Sounded amazing so I headed for Dinghao.  Unfortunately, my eating companion doesn't eat pork so I opted to try other dishes. Here's what we had:  Green onion pancakes:  Arrived so saturated in grease that they glistened from the oil.  When I told the waitress I couldn't eat them because they were too greasy, she went to the back and got me a pile of napkins. Really?  She expected me to soak up pancakes that were super saturated in fat?  I told her I didn't want them.  She came back a few minutes later with a new batch that looked better but still greasy.  I would not order them again. Vegetable spring rolls:  Small, not too greasy with cabbage inside.  Not worth the calories. Schezwan Noodles:  We asked if these were like cold sesame noodles and were told yes.  A small portion of noodles arrived with a brownish paste and bean sprouts.  Not exactly what we expected, didn't wow us and would not order it again.   Vegetable fried rice:  Large portion, with visible pieces of broccoli, peas and carrots.  Not very flavorful.  A little sesame oil would have made the difference.  Would not order it again. Spicy Shrimp:  Generous portion, about 11 shrimp with heads and shells on. Fresh and delicious.  At $12.95 I thought it was a good value.  I would eat this again. Chicken with Broccoli:  My companion tried to get Orange Chicken made with un-breaded chicken.  The waiter insisted that it couldn't be done which we could not understand considering that Chicken with Broccoli is made with un-breaded chicken.  He settled for chicken with broccoli and asked that it be prepared very, very, very spicy.  The waiter said that this dish is not usually spicy but that they would spice it up.  I chimed in that he liked it super spicy so not to be afraid to spice it up.  Nevertheless, the dish arrived without any spice and on top of that, it was over-salted.   Enough said.  I think you guys get the idea.   Too bad I didn't try the steam buns during this visit because it definitely will be my last.   '

First time here.  I was motivated to try this place because Yelp sent some email about waffles.  On the list was Lo-Lo's.  Well, you know how that goes.  It gets into your head and you gotta try it.  Saturday is my non-cooking day, but it wasn't the smartest thing to show up at Lo Lo's on a Saturday night.  Yikes,  the line was out the door, into their patio, into the parking lot and up the street (just kidding about the street)  Went to check in to give my name and number in the party but had to wait because too many people were fussing about the wait and who got there first, etc.  Luckily the owner (I think; lady with short red hair) was a strong yet polite lady and explained that the 50-60 minute wait was what it was.  If it was shorter, good, but she couldn't guarantee that.  People don't like to hear the truth.  I was prepared to face up to my stupidity of coming on a Saturday night when there is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday.  So I KNEW I was waiting and I would be waiting until people finished smacking their lips on that delish fried chicken and everything else.  But No.  People gotta fuss.  Speaking of fussing, a woman slid in front of me and when the check-in lady looked at both of us to figure out who was there first, the woman said to me,  "I was waiting here didn't you see me?".  My answer was "No, I didn't.  But you go on ahead because I am not starting a scene here over a table".  I think the owner overheard me and smiled.  Did I tell you the woman was bigger than I am?  I am no stupid chick from the Bronx.  You don't fight unless you have to and it won't be over a table.  So about 20 minutes later the owner, shall I call her Redhead, for short? motioned us over and led us to a table for four.  Nice table, I thought and not so long a wait.  She picks up the menus from the table and says, come with me, I have a better seat for you--I like you guys.  And then she led me to the almighty BOOTH.  I love Booths. I love Booths, Did I tell you I love booths?  OMG. A booth.  Thank you lord. Thank you Ms. Redhead.  I knew that stepping back and not body slamming that aggressive woman at the beginning would pay off. Did I tell you she was bigger than I am?  Did I tell you we don't fight in the Bronx unless it's for big stakes.  Yes, I believe I did.   Phase II--SITTING IN THE BOOTH: So now we order.  We got two waters and one beer.  AND WE WAITED FOREVER FOR THE WATERS.  FOREVER.  How about 20 minutes? We stopped a guy to ask him to get our waitress and then, the waters parted and our waitress was there with our waters, beer and what seemed to be everybody else's waters.  She said, Sorry it took so long, but we had to wait until the glasses were washed.  Wow.  I realize it is a packed house but at moments like these when you run out of glasses what's wrong with serving water out of a red party cup?  I wouldn't have minded especially with the generous slice of lemon they put in it.  Think about it.  I understand beer and cocktails being served in glass (BTW, they are large mason jars I forgot to tell you), but not water.  You can slide on water. Hubby ordered the chicken salad with a side of french fries.  I went on full mode pig out.  2 fried chicken thighs with a waffle AND a side of mac and cheese.   Hubby's order came out with the bacon he did NOT want.  Know anybody else who doesn't eat bacon?  I don't. Just him.  When corrected, the salad had mixed greens, half a sliced avocado and nice chunks of fried chicken.  The fries were fresh with a sprinkling of some delicious topping.  He was happy.  My thighs were not greasy (the chicken's, that is). The waffle, while thin, had a lot of flavor (maybe vanilla and cinnamon).  The mac and cheese was tasty and creamy.  What it was lacking was the crunchiness on the top and the corners.  I like the mac n cheese to have crunch on top.  This was smooth like "Stouffers".  Not saying it's Stouffers, just texture wise.   I totally enjoyed my gorge-fest. I finished everything on the plate.  Hubby on the other hand said that while the salad was fresh, varied and plentiful his chicken salad was not worth a repeat visit.  As always, he said he could stay home and get better food.  Yes, ladies.  That is the punishment for learning to cook and cook well.  Men are like breast fed babies when it comes to home cooked meals.  They want breast milk and will reject formulas or substitutes that are just as good.  So let's ignore hubby's assessment and trust me that the food was very good and worth a repeat visit.  Thank you Ms. Redhead for the booth and the great food.

I don't know who Adela is but I think I love Adela.   I wish I could say that I hated this place so all of you would stay away and I would have no problems getting a table.  But I think those days are on the horizon anyway.  By 6PM, almost every table was taken with parties of 4 or more.  Yup.  People have discovered this place.   Freshly baked bread with a hint of garlic & butter =5 stars Salad offered for $1.99 (with dinner) was excellent.  Spring Mix, lovely light balsamic =5 stars Eggplant Parmagiana with spaghetti= 5 stars (although I prefer thinner pasta such as Angel Hair---they may want to think about that) Eggplant, chicken combo with spaghetti =5 stars. Service provided by James was 10 stars.  Total attention, politeness, great manners.   Waters always filled and you can't beat the $5. house wine.  (I wish we had been given a little more -- I think they gave us 4 ounces)  but what do you want for $5?  The verdict is that I will be back with bells on.  (that means, for sure! )

Ok owners of Sol Caribe.  You are here by a miracle of G-d because the 3 prior restaurants in this location have gone defunct--meaning out-of-business.  It seems that this locale is an unlucky spot but as I always say, People will flock to good food.   Well, here is the first thing you don't do in your restaurant.  You don't tell a Puertorican patron raised in NYC, partially in the Bronx, that you don't have hot sauce because "Puertoricans don't eat hot sauce".  Really?  Even Applebees has a bottle of hot sauce.  I am not saying carry 12 different kinds of hot sauces.  I am saying one bottle.  99 cents in Food City.  Of course Puertoricans eat hot sauce!! Ever heard of homemade "Pique"?  Come on now.   Ordered the mofongo with Carne Frita.  When I asked about the sauce that comes with it , Maria, the very polite and sweet waitress (5 stars for her) said: "mayo-ketchup".  I said Mayo-Ketchup?????? and then Sweet Maria was going to explain.  No need to explain. Ketchup and Mayonnaise mixed together.  They call that French dressing.  I don't remember Ponce De Leon (explorer and first Governor of Puerto Rico) putting that on his mofongo.  Let's keep a Puertorican dish like Mofongo authentic.  You can have either chicken broth or gravy from stewed chicken or the gravy from "carne guisada" on it.  But not Mayo-Ketchup.  That is an American invention and this is not an American restaurant.  Remember... "Puerto Rican Cuisine".   The mofongo which was served with a few pieces of carne frita and a lettuce and tomato salad, was ok--not dry.  The meat was a tad salty.   Hubby ventured into the grilled chicken breast with arroz con gandules.  I discouraged him from having the grilled chicken because I knew they were going to overcook it as most latin restaurants tend to do with their beef, chicken or any other protein.  But stubbornness found its way into his head again (I thought I had vacated "stubbornness along with selfishness but stubbornness found its way back) and ordered it anyway.  Well, not only was it overdone but no taste to it.  You have to MARINATE meat folks, especially chicken breast.  A little extra virgin olive oil with fresh chopped garlic, salt, pepper, oregano and a twist of lime and you will have a piece of grilled chicken breast that will make you spin on your head. So simple.  The dish had rice and lettuce and tomatoes.  Rice was ok. Nothing to write home about.   Here is my advice to new owners: 1.  Never say you don't have hot sauce, it sounds stupid. 2.  Hold back on the salt on the fried pork.   3.  Serve your mofongos with chicken broth on the side or gravy from one of your stewed meats.  Save the mayo-ketchup for hamburger if you serve any.  4.  Marinate your meats before grilling.  They will taste better. 5.  Keep Sweet Maria working there.  She was the highlight of our visit.

Came in today with granddaughter who got the most beautiful henna tattoo from Beth. We were both delighted with it.  Take a look at the photo.  I got a smaller one that didn't hold up well because I got it on the lower arm and it is too active of an area (I think).    Nice, clean attractive shop with lots of interesting goodies to buy.   Will come by with friends soon.  Thanks Beth.

I used to be a customer of BelFiore, the prior italian restaurant at  this location.  I was really fond of BelFiore and this go-to place created a void for me when it closed.  So I really wanted to like its replacement. The place looks better than it did before but considering the amount of time it took to reopen, I expected more of a transformation.  It is clean, freshly painted, old bar gone and an inordinately large bussing area added.  Some pictures on the wall, but nothing to deliberately add anything meaningful to the decor. The bakery is almost sparse of baked goods--just a few trays of cookies, but no slices of cakes or pastries one might expect in an italian bakery.  We were served complimentary hot bread & butter.  We couldn't decide at the table whether it was good or not, but I thought it was.  Later on when they brought another seeded roll, it was agreed that the seeded bread was really good.  Entrees came with small salads consisting of iceberg lettuce, one slice of tomato, thinly chopped black olives and one pepperocini pepper.  Everybody loved that little pepper.  The salad was mundane but it was nice of them to offer one with the entree.  Ordered Fettucini Alfredo, eggplant parmagiana which came with spaghetti and one order of chicken cutlet/eggplant combination without cheese (also came with spaghetti).  We were so impressed with the portions when they arrived--except for the fettucini alfredo.  Although it was just pasta (no meat or veggies in it), the portion seems awfully small for a pasta dish.  In addition, salt had to be added to it to make it edible.  Somebody under salted the pasta water.  Very important when making pasta  I also noticed that the pasta was not drained properly which caused the alfredo sauce to become watery.  Other than that the other two dishes were very good.  Hubby was really happy with the eggplant/chicken combination and I was happy with the eggplant--really nicely prepared.  Frankly, for me the red sauce was not stellar but it was enough to satisfy most pallets, including my husbands. The service was attentive throughout the meal.  Dino's is a place where we will be returning if they could just get that Fettucini Alfredo under control.

As promised during my last review of Dino's, I returned to see how things had improved over time.  They took over the former Belfiore's and my last visit garnered a 4 star review.  It would have been 5 stars had their fettucini alfredo been on point.   Despite being Saturday night, Dino's did not have a full house-- I would say it was mostly empty except for maybe 5  tables including myself.  They also had a little gathering going on in a separate room.  I noted that they did a lot of decorative work on the place.  A paint job, more pictures on the wall and the words "Ristoranti" in bold red letters in the dining room.  The former owners had been criticized for their blah decor, so this was clearly a step in the right direction.  Could use a lot more pictures in the new party room.  I know you are just interested in my opinion of the food but I am giving them credit where credit is due and I am also avoiding the discussion about food.   Ordering:  I saw chicken and veal parmagiana on the menu as well as shrimp scampi.  So I thought to myself, why not ask them to make me shrimp parmagiana- I haven't had that in a while.  So I told the waitress (who was fairly new to the job) what I wanted and she wrote it down and she said there might be an up charge.  I said OK, just find out what the up charge is before I finalize the order.  The young lady returned to tell me that the chef cannot make shrimp parmagiana.  I asked why.  She said that the shrimp have been already apportioned (?) and therefore he cannot make it.  I said, "HUH?".  I tried to explain how it could be made.  I said: "You sautee shrimp, put marinara sauce on it, add mozzarella and melt it in the broiler. You know,  like you would do with a chicken cutlet if you were making chicken parmagiana."  To which the waitress answered:  "What's a chicken cutlet?"  She said, "I never heard of that before".  I KID YOU NOT.  Then I knew the conversation was over. No other words needed to be uttered.   I ordered chicken parmagiana instead.  I also ordered a salad with blue cheese dressing on the side.  The salad has improved since the last time. It Included red onions, 1 pepperocini pepper, and the outside of a piece of tomato, and sliced black olives.  Better than before, but the tomato was kind of weird, it had all the seeds and insides removed.  When the salad arrived, it came with a side of some other type of dressing- reddish in color but definitely not blue cheese dressing. (PHOTO)  Asked another waitress for blue cheese dressing and got it.   They served us fresh, hot bread.  Not super delicious but not bad at all.  I enjoyed it with butter.  Hubby asked for olive oil to dip the bread, but the quality of the oil was so bad that it wasn't worth dunking--You know, that super light olive oil that tastes like nothing.   My chicken parmagiana looked quite attractive when it arrived. (PHOTO).  I found the dish overdressed with spaghetti sauce--drowning in fact.  The chef has to cut back on the amount of sauce.  I also noted that the sauce had an overwhelming amount of oregano.  Oregano is the kind of spice that should make a dish taste better not take over the dish.  No one wants to eat oregano. The chicken was overcooked and so was the capellini pasta.  It's easy to over- cook capellini-- 8 minutes is all it needs.  Couldn't finish the dish.  Hubby's penne was not overcooked but his chicken was.  His dish too was saturated with sauce.  He asked for a chicken-eggplant combo and got an up charge of $5 on the bill.  Shouldn't the waitress have explained that beforehand?  I had asked what the up charge would have been on my theoretical shrimp parmagiana--why wouldn't we want to know about the up charge on hubby's dish?  Service:   Our young waitress was clearly inexperienced but she did her best.  Wrong dressing is an innocent mistake but she needs to learn what a chicken cutlet is.  Ideally, the training for a waitress should include the ingredients and preparation of a dish.  I realize this is not an expensive restaurant, but training should be done never-the-less.   I wish I could be more positive about our experience last night.  I will say that the pizza on the next table looked really delicious.  Hope it was.

This small stand is inside the Paradise Valley Mall food court.  Keep in mind that when I looked for  the restaurant in the Paradise Valley Mall Directories, it was not listed.  So don't leave the place just because you don't see it.  Hopefully, the owners will do something about this.  Ordered the meatball/beef pho and another chicken pho but without noodles.  Both Pho's had powerful, delicious broths and generous portions of everything.  Lots of meatballs in mine which I totally enjoyed considering that I had a bad cold and this hot delicious broth awakened my body again.  The owner is so affable and attentive.  He came out to see how our pho's were and offered to give the person who chose no noodles additional chicken and veggies.  Lovely gesture.   This is the place to go if you want a magnificent pho is the Phoenix area without having to venture out into the Avenues.  Oh, and i almost forgot.  $5.95 for PHO?  Absolutely fantastic price.

This Popeye's just opened a week ago.  I went through the drive-thru because it was after 9PM.  Ordered a 4 piece dinner which was fresh, crispy and delicious.  Loved the mashed potato side with cajun gravy.  Jessica (I think that was her name) was on duty and was great server.  A big smile goes a long way.  Glad to have Popeye's in the neighborhood!

Just picked up a 3 piece meal with mashed potatoes and biscuit.  Omg-- the chicken breast was totally, totally dry.  Inedible.  I have not had this experience before.  Husband wouldn't eat it and threw it out!    Did I get an old piece of chicken???? Really upset that I paid for this.

Asian Fusion Cafe has a varied menu from "American Chinese" dishes to super authentic szechuan and cantonese dishes to desserts.  Yes, Yes.  A chinese restaurant who serves desserts other than a fortune cookie or pineapple pieces.   We had scallion pancakes which were nice but I wish they had more scallion in them.  What I totally loved about them was that THEY WERE NOT GREASY AT ALL.  Most of the time my hands are greasy from touching them.  Not these, Good job.    I went on the wild side and ordered one of my favorite things in life--Pig ears--LOL.  Yes, they had pig ears which arrived sliced thin in hot chili oil.  They were room temperature and were a good combination with the scallion pancakes and white rice.  I tried not to eat the chili oil because of the calories but the ears were flavorful enough without it.  The crunchiness of the cartilage was great and it is one of the things I love about pig ears-the crunch factor.    Hubby ordered orange chicken (one of the chinese American dishes) and found the crust to be intolerably thick.  They gladly replaced the dish for beef with broccoli (adventurous isn't he?). The beef and broccoli was a tad on the salty side so when we go again we will ask them to keep the salt down.   I found the server to be really helpful (since it was our first time) and gracious when we asked to return the orange chicken.  She even told us to take it home since they didn't want it to go to waste.  What a nice young lady!   We noticed lots of asian families eating here so clearly they are happy with the authenticity of the food.  Their menu has lots to choose from even if you are not the pig ears eating type.   We'll be back and next time we'll have dessert.

I knew this was a new place and was hoping to love this healthy venue, but I did not like my first experience at Mad Greens.  Had the large "Greek" Salad.  Hardly a greek salad considering that there were just "crumbs" of feta cheese which did not have a real feta flavor.  Generous portion of romain lettuce with NO CRUNCH TO IT, some kalamata olives that did not have a nice flavor to them, and some "citrus" flavored cubes of chicken.   Did not like the citrus chicken--not citrusy at all and so small that it was dried out.  Hubby upset that I paid $10 bucks for a large salad of mainly tasteless romaine.  The dressing which had red wine vinegar and what appeared to be whipped dressing that did not taste good.  It was allegedly supposed to have feta cheese, but no such thing. No feta flavor.   I used my own dressing to try to eat it.  Hubby did not eat any of it and encouraged me to just dump it because he was not going to eat it.   I would suggest that the place rethink as to how they can keep the greens crispy.  At home I usually put my greens in a bath of ice water and they crisp up wonderfully. They have to work on making sure the chicken is moist and if it is a greek salad then you need to have some PIECES of feta cheese.  Since this appears to be a franchise, it is unlikely that they can change their formulas or procedures.   I wish them the best but I have to be honest about this place.   I will give them 6 months and try them again and hopefully they will have corrected their shortcomings.
