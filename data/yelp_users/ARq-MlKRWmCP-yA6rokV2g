Great place to meet up with your friends.  Good pours, great prices and a free breakfast if you are interested.  I think my only problem with this place is I sat at the bar and noticed that the wait staff fills up your glasses of water from the sink faucet not the gun at the bar. My friend asked about it and she said, it's the owner and there he is right there if you want to bring it up with him.

If I just had to review today I would never give this place another dime. Usually my husband and I get a to go order and love it. We actually had lunch there today. Called for a delivery this evening at 6:30, the girl was so rude so we ordered from somewhere else.  When I got off the phone with her my husband said...let me guess same girl from last time you tried to call in order in?! That was 2 months ago, I am assuming it is family. Don't go to this place for their hospitality.
