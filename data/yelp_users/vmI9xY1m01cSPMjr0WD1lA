I've been wearing acrylic nails off and on for the past 20 years. I had a full set put on and my nails ached almost immediately. I had them removed a week later. This is how my hands look.   I would be concerned about the quality of the products they use if I were you.

Dr. Howard is the most incredible vet I have ever met. Her compassion for our animals, as well as our family has been second to none. She is loving and caring and compassionate and truly has the well being of your pet as her foremost goal. She absolutely exceeded our expectations as we walked together through a fatal illness that one of my kitties had. From the day we walked in, until the time we had to say goodbye Dr. Howard made herself available, was always willing to answer any questions that we had and talked to us whenever we were scared, at a loss and just did not know what to do. This clinic is absolutely amazing and I will never take another pet anywhere else!! Thank you!!!!

Really bad service. Staff thought it was more appropriate to sit down, relax and tell jokes than to actually pay attention to the guests.

Absolutely the WORST pool company that I have EVER had to deal with.  The customer service is horrible.  After leaving many messages over the course of a few weeks I was only able to contact them when I called them AGAIN.  I asked to speak with the actual pool tech who initially came to my house.  The RUDE lady on the phone told me that she was more than capable to answer my questions - about a pump that SHE HAS NOT SEEN, and about a conversation I had with the tech THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR.    I was assigned to them by my home warranty company, and I will be filing a serious complaint with them and the BBB.  I was told to take the cash out option from the warranty company for the part and then they would do the work and I could just pay them directly.  After I received the cash out and called to schedule the appointment I was told that I need to replace the entire pool pump system and that would cost an additional $400 and that there was an electrical problem and that it would cost additional money as well.    I was then told that the salt cell that I need is no longer on the market, even though I was able to find them on Amazon.  This is the reason that I am STILL trying to discuss my options with the tech who ACTUALLY SAW MY POOL AND THE PUMP.    If you don't want to be scammed or jacked around with USE ANOTHER POOL COMPANY.

I am extremely impressed with Dr. Cramer.  He is very attentive and really tries to get to know his patients.  It seems as though he knows your needs prior to you expressing them.  My experience was much better than my expectations.  I will definitely be back!

Excellent food and customer service.  Friendly staff who answered all of my questions.  Some of the best Indian food I have ever eaten.

I can't rate the Dr because I've been waiting 3 hours and have not seem him yet. After the 6 hour wait, and yes I waited because it took me three months to schedule an appointment, the doctor seemed to very knowledgable unfortunately I will not be seeing him again.

The studio is clean and bright and welcoming the staff is incredibly knowledgable and helpful. I have had back surgery and all the instructors help with modifications. This is such a great workout. The spin and Pilates combo class is absolutely amazing. So glad I accidentally came across this studio!!

I went through the drive-thru yesterday and was served by Angel. She truly is an angel. I had a "oh no what did I do because I haven't had my coffee yet" moment. Angel went over and above to fix MY problem. She was quick and courteous and I had my corrected order in under two minutes. She is a star employee.

I had huge pieces of furniture that needed to be moved. Guys were prompt and professionally dressed. Great attitudes and excellent service. I am a real estate agent and will refer them to all my clients!!
