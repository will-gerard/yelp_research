This place is solid! I ordered at lunchtime for pickup and the lady said it would be 15 minutes-- I got there in 15 minutes right as my order came out, perfect! I had the falafel gyro and it delicious. My gyro was overflowing with big falafels, I couldn't ask for more, and the pita was also nice and soft. My friend got the regular gyro and she said it was tasty as well. The tzatziki sauce was great as well.

Mediocre at best. Too cool staff that can't be bothered. I ordered the veggie sandwich and the amount of avocado on it was so sad...like half a teaspoon spread over the entire sandwich. My boyfriend really liked the giant sandwich though, the one full of meat. Peppers are really good, but for the price I feel like it should be included. I don't think I'll be back.
