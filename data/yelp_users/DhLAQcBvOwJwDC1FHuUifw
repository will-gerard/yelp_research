This place is awesome when you want good food and dont have much time. When I am in a pinch I will order the falafel to go. It is filling and yummy!  I have also had the gyro and side salad on previous visits. Highly recommended!!

The service department is awesome! We take our VW to Michael Miller for all of our warranty work, he has always gone above and beyond for us. I particularly love the fact we get loaner cars if my car needs to be in the shop for an extended period...Thank Camelback VW!

Far and away better than....Garcia's, Top Shelf, Valle Luna Etc... The salsa is a little sweet with just the right amount of spicy "bite" to it. The best part is the "pollo especial" a chicken chimi covered in a spicy cream cheese sauce! My only gripe is that there isnt a location closer to me in the far west valley!

The best zoo in Arizona! If you havent been you need to go. If you've been there but it's been awhile...go back! The Aquariums are awesome and the overall experience is 10 times better than the Phoenix zoo. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  TIP: search the local paper for the buy one get one free coupons...they are always available

I wish I could give a negative star review! They are the stereo-typical delaership. It was a very strenuous sales process, but I really wanted the vehicle they had, so I bought it. I assumed the poor experience would be over after I signed the contract and bought the car....how wrong was I??? They did not get my tags within the 45 days that my temp plate was good for, they issued me another 45 day temp plate and it expired without me recieving the tags. i went in to speak with the General manager, John Anderson...this is where it gets really bad! (they say the fish rots at the head) After explaining my issue he told me there was nothing they could do to assist me. i explained that I cannot afford to risk driving on a expired plate...he told me to park the car until they got the title. Obviously that answer is unacceptable...I am just a regular working man with 1 car and I need to get back and forth to work. In my effort to get some results, I must have upset John...he started yelling and cussing (in the middle of the showroom), he told me to leave the dealership. I explained that I couldnt leave because my car was in the service department. He didnt care, and again explicitly told me to leave and he didnt care where my car was. I had to call the police department to the dealership so I could get my car back. As it stands now, my tags expire today, I have no clue when they will figure out the title issue (their bast guess is another 30days or so) and I am going to tell everyone I bump into about my experience! I am also filing a complaint with their corporate office!  My advice: Stay as far away from LARRY MILLER DODGE as possible. They have a culture of poor service and rude customer treatment...it starts at the general manager JOHN ANDERSON and goes all the way down!

We had a great time here! We brought the son and his grandparents. This is definitely on the annual traditions list. The best part was the loooong nap the son took afterward! Highly recommended for anyone with kids that needs an inexpensive outdoor experience.

My parents were in town for a family function and we were looking for a place to grab some breakfast. We found Brother's and were very pleased we did! They serve great breakfasts (I recommend the bacon and sausage skillet) The server was very nice and she kept my coffee filled! We will be back whenever we find ourselves hungry and in Peoria!

My wife and son took me here for a Father's Day lunch. I enjoyed one of the best chicken club sandwiches I have ever had! The wife had what looked to be an awesome salad with fried chicken breast on top. Even our picky kid ate all of his chicken strips! We definitely recommend this place if you are on the west side.

Just got here...ill be back to tell you all about it...  What a great dinner this was, cucumber shrimp risotto, braised short ribs and a sampler dessert...tiramisu, canoli and brownie! I left full and completely satisfied. The risotto was one of the best dishes I have ever had. I would recommend Spiedini to anyone in the Vegas area...I will definitely be a return customer!

I usually go to RIcos' for a breakfast meeting once a week but they were doing some remodeling. The kind people at Rico's spoke with management at Hole-in-the-Wall and set us up for a breakfast meeting there (or so we thought). When we arrived the hostess looked like a deer in the headlights. They were not expecting us and were not ready for 17 hungry people to be there at open. The entire time was an excersize in confusion and disorganization. The waitress kept saying that nobody was told about our party. Funny thing is, I was on my way to the restroom and overheard two employees talking about how they taught my waitress a lesson today...not sure what happened behind the scenes but oh well. I wont be back here to worry about it.

Awesome price and selection for fresh produce! The best part about this place is the restaurant inside. The only way to get better homemade mexican food is to have your very own nana named Rosa! I recommend the Carnitas street tacos! It's also pretty cool watching them make chicharones, as long as you're not vegan that is. If you visit, you must get a drink called Plantano that they sell next to the bakery

This is the worst walmart out of the bunch! and that's saying alot. It took me 35 minutes to get assistance trying to print out some photos! The first employee I asked for assistance told me he's off in 4 minutes and he still needed to count his drawer so he couldn't help me...Really! I wanted to scream. I finally got some assistance when I picked up the paging phone and across the intercome told the store I was a customer in photo that needs help. I have been in this store on several occasions and I am always disappointed with the lack of customer service and the overall "get it yourself, I am too busy to help" attitudes of the employees. I tell anyone I care about to stay away from this location!

Stayed here for a business trip. The rooms were very nice, the pillows were comfy and the best part was the HUGE jetted tub! I will be here again as I had a great dinner at Spiedini and fun in the casino. It was nice to be off the strip and low- key

Busiest breakfast joint on the westside! We had to wait an hour to get seated. It was worth every minute of the wait. The portions are huge, the food tastes like homemade and the service is outstanding. Whether you're in Flagstaff or Phoenix, this is THE place to eat breakfast

The gyros are fantastic! Unfortunately the falafel is always overcooked. All in all, its a good place for a quick lunch or dinner. If I have time to plan a meal, I would probably end up somewhere else.

We went here for dinner with a few out of town guests. We walked in with a party of 10 and Nakama had no problems getting us seated quickly. I started with edamame (free with Yelp check-in), continued with vegas rolls and several sashimi pieces and finished with sake! The service was great, especially considering our party size and the food was fantastic! My wife and I will be back every time we get that craving for quality sushi! Thank you Nakama.

Stopped by here for a set of new tires for the beach cruiser. We walked in and  were greeted by a very helpful employee named Scott. He helped me figure out which tires and tubes will work best for me. He also recommend a tube protector that has worked great for me! I also appreciated the YELP! deal, it saved me $6! Thanks!

We went here for a work related function. There was 20+ people in our party. The service was fast and efficient, the food was fantastic and the drinks were the best part.  New york strip and truffle mac and cheese!! To top off the whole deal, we made it in before happy hour and all steaks and appetizers were half price! Next time I'm in vegas i will be visiting Herb's and Rye!

Pizza is great and the wings are huge. I came in on a Thursday night to pick up dinner and they were slammed. The girl working the counter was running her ass off and yet she took the time to make sure she was couteous to everyone. We will be back.

Our son had a temp of about 103*. We were able to break it but it would go right back up. We decided to take him to Good Night Pediatrics (Urgent Care for kids). The nurses were nice and the doctor was very helpful, she ran a few tests and answered all of our questions. It ended up being some type of viral infection that just needed to work its course. They sent us home with some children's Motrin and dosing instructions. Overall, the experience was good and we will return if/ when the boy gets sick again.  I did have one complaint and....In my opinion a nurse should not tell a child that his medicine is candy. My son doesn't know what candy is but I would hate for someone else's child to take/eat medicine, thinking its candy because a lazy nurse can't find a different way to get a kid to open his mouth.

Completely average for a furniture store...I did get a sweet deal on my son's bed. The poor review is due to the sales process. I walked in with the ad in my hand and cash in my pocket. I knew exactly what I wanted and it still took 45 minutes...NO I don't want the paint protectant, NO I don't want the warranty, NO I don't want delivery, NO I don't want a lamp to match the bed, NO NO NO! I felt like I was buying a car...

We went here with our 10 month old son and our 3.5 year old neice. We had a wonderful time, there was plenty of space to run around and it was also divided into younger/ old kid play areas. It was exactly what we needed,  my wife and I could enjoy an iced coffee in the A/C while the kids ran around and spent most of their energy. The other parents were all very nice and the kids played together well. When we were done we enjoyed a quiet drive home because the kids were passed out! We will be returning on those hot summer days when we dont want to deal with our local public pool.

They are ALWAYS the best! They greet you promptly and the place is always clean. They are also one of the few places that have freshly brewed tea ready for you 24 hrs a day. I also appreciate the fact there is usually a cop in the parking lot...it helps make you feel safe when stopping in a shady neighborhood in the middle of the night.

Awesome place to grab a beer after work! I have had several of their craft beers and the servers made great recommendations each time. I enjoy sitting on the patio and hanging out  when I'm there. Also, the owner Mat is very friendly and does a GREAT job making this a fun place to have a brew

What can I say that hasn't been said in the previous reviews? They kick ass! I have recently quit cigarettes and have been visiting vape shops around Phoenix since I am using the E-cig. This is the single best shop I have been to. They take the time to answer even the silliest of questions. They showed me around and educated me on the options i have. They had a sweet deal on YELP and when my coworker goes in today to spend some cash, I will get a free bottle of E-liquid...this will be the only place I do business with when it comes to E-cigs etc.

Horrible customer service! I walked in on a Sunday to ask some questions and spend some money. There were two other customers there but they had a total of three employees behind the counter. Lucky me, I must have gotten the worst employee there to help me. A heavy-set brown haired lady did the best she could to ignore me and when I finally piped up and asked for assistance I got several short, snorty answers. Against my better judgement I bought two bottles of juice and luckily enough the product is quality stuff. Too bad the service sucks...I won't be back.

5 stars for the food! 1 star for the service. We came here on a Tuesday night for a birthday party. We waited an hour and a half to be seated (a bit long but acceptable considering there were 10 of us) only to end up at three different booths that weren't even in the same section. This place has good food but it's not worth the hassle and wait you have to go through. We will order take out but we wont dine in anymore...
