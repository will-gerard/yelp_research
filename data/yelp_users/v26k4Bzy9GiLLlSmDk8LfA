The wife and I ate dinner here tonight and we got the veggie sandwich.  It was amazing we were both blown away.  Will you please put this on the menu?

Best corned beef in Arizona hands Down the sandwiches are big enough to share.  The place is what a typical deli should be and trust me I know delis. They have everything you can imagine on the menu.  The pictures on the wall are priceless and look like they have been there 30+ years.

It is not possible for me to LOVE this place more than I already do! I was taken here for a birthday and had the most wonderful time! Everything from ambiance, to service, to the food was AMAZING! The salad was light and flavorful and the tarte entree was divine! HIGHLY recommended!

One word, YUMMY!  No matter who you go with or what you are in the mood for- everyone, including your picky friend, will be pleased! They have food for everyone!  Come hungry- larger than life portions! Currently picturing the meatloaf- wish I had more room in my belly!  The mushroom burger is a life changing experience! Came highly recommended by the server- award winning apparently. After experiencing it, I'm a believer!  Happy Hour lasts for about a milisecond- but if you find yourself here at the right time- go for it! Bar only- but it's worth the taste and the price.  Cheesecake is of course awesome- but I can count the number of times I've actually had room left in my stomach to order the cheesecake on one hand. Dulce De Leche has been my "go to" for years!

Food is always great.  I love the meatloaf sandwich.  The service is really hit or miss.  Sometimes I have great servers who are passionate about their work.  Other times service is just ok.  The ground is always super slick and sticky and it really takes away from the nice decor.

Ordered a chicken sandwich and thought it was a pretty safe bet. It was not!!!! The chicken was rubber and had me question if was actually chicken. My server looked like he was straight out of prison on work release. So when he recommended that sandwich I should have known better. I'm not sure why I ate here it was my own fault.  Why does anyone eat at these shitty places.

Finally!! I've been trying to go here forever and I made it! This location definitely needs a makeover it's like stuck in the 80's. The bar had 4 stools and the place felt kinda sad. But I got carry out so didn't have to spend much time in there. The pizza was amazing sauce was a little sweet but I loved it. The thin crust isn't that thin and the cheese is not crappy Kraft.

I'm confused why is called, "hot and ready." Whenever I go there I have to wait for my pizza. But for the price $5 you can't be that upset. Its defiantly not that great but for the price it is.

The chix parm is the only thing worth getting.  Everything else is prepared too far in advance like the chix for pasta is prepared earlier and warmed up. Chix parm was good just very thin.  It's a chain I should have known better.

I don't get it... I feel like I missed the memo.  Food is aweful- I don't care how drunk you get, you'll still know it stinks!  Rainy day margarita is my one good memory that I can take away from this place- good times.  Interesting blend of people- old, young, and everywhere in between. Yet, still not the first place I'm willing to go to.

I never got served and when I did the waitress told me that she wasn't supposed to take tables yet.  So I grabbed my shit and left.  I didn't want her to work off the clock for free.  So I brought my business elsewhere.  Will never be back.

Its good not as good as Geghis grill in tempe but its up there.  The meat is all frozen and paper thin it kinda scares me. But, the sauces and the noodles are great. It is nice that drinks, ice cream, rice and soup are included in the price and there is no servers so it makes it real affordable. Note: they do charge you for togo boxes 50 cents per. some veggies and yogurt are only available at night!!!!

Don't ever use the pharmacy here unless and want your prescription to never be ready when you need it.  They are all in a shitty mood and always tell me that they need more staff and are over their heads in work.  The deli counter makes me nervous that they never clean the slicer or the tub of meat that they use to cut the plastic off the boars head packaging for every meat.... Nasty. I do go here for TP and soda only because it 1/2 mile from my place.

My first time at a Pho restaurant and I will defiantly be back I had the Chicken bowl with noodles and spiced it up.  Great flavor perfect for a cold night or your fighting a cold.  Very clean restaurant with nice decor.  The owner came by to see how our lunch was. We loved it.  Cost around $10 per person.  Kinda of pricey but you are getting very fresh ingredients with high quality.

This is the only place I take my car to get an oil change.  The are reliable, fast, and trustworthy also the price is around $22. I only have good things to say about this place.  They wont try to sell you a bunch of stuff. They tell you the facts. They even through in new wipers for me for free. I guess it pays to be a repeat customer.  One thing I will say is the other Sun Devil Auto's suck. I would never take my car to any other Sun Devil Auto.

I love the wide variety of meats and vegetables they offer. Sometime the chicken looks very fatty but then i just load up on shrimp.  The sauces are amazing and all the spices......im in heaven. Did I mention that you can get an egg mixed in with your stir fry.  You give your bowl to the hair net man and tell him what carb you want brown rice, noddles, white rice. tortillas.   I like this place much more than YC's because there are so many more options...

I understand accidents happen ok. But, we went in 2 weeks later and saw glass all over the floor AGAIN.  We did are shopping and we looked back before we left and it was still there just swept to the side.  WOW!

I had the red curry with chicken and I really enjoyed it.  It was rather slow for a Friday night and the servers were kind of slowwww. Took about 10 minutes just to get our drink order and another 10 to get the actual drinks.  So my 4 star review is a generous one and based mostly on the food.

The food is very good they slice the meat tableside. I wish I could eat more red meat but my stomach only allows so much before I feel sick. It cost around $110 dollars including tip and tax.  It was kinda of pricey! I did go here for New Years Eve and it was soooooo busy I could barely make it to the salad bar. The service was very good and im not sure if I would eat here again.!!

The M Resort is a "Must Visit Spot" whenever I find myself in Vegas! What's not to love?? It's new, clean, fresh, beautiful! And did I mention they have windows? Yes, that's right windows, natural light! The M is especially beautiful during the holidays- their decorations are warm and lovely! Makes me proud and happy to loose my money!  The buffet is sooo worth the line!! I mean they have hummas! Hummas! Oh, and windows with a view! And on the TVs it's all Food Network, all day! Can I move in and live at the buffet? Please?  If you remember only one thing from this review, I wish it to be this: PLEASE go sign up for a Players Card! It's FREE and comes with awesome goodies and freebies!

I don't know how anyone can give this more than 1 star. After reading peoples reviews I think that the buffet at one time was good. I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me. This is the worst quality of food I have ever had. It was tiny and the selection of foods were horrible. Greasy mess. I ate the bare minimum to get me full. I should have got my money back. Will never eat here again it's all yours old people.

Really good food and an incredible menu. I really enjoyed the noble broccoli with brown rice.  The curry Devine was really good and a really good size. I asked for it spicy and they were able to accommodate me.  My wife is vegan so that is why I originally came here. Now I request to go here. My only problem was I waited 50 minutes on a Takeout order that I phoned ahead and was told 25 minutes. But it was worth the wait.

I wish that chips and salsa were free $3.50 kinda disappointing and the sandwiches/tortas don't come with any sides.  Fun hip place I scored brownie points with the wife on this one.

I've frequented Modern Steak a few times and honestly each experience has been different. I first went here with another couple for restaurant week and the service was rather snooty. We felt rushed and skipped over- that sticks out over the food I ate there that night.   The other and most recent excursion to Modern Steak was for happy hour. We ate in the bar area, which is just as lovely as the main dinning area, and the menu was very good! Only problem was trying to figure out what to order first. Fries were yummy and the sliders were very good- believe I got two orders of the sliders.

I was excited to go here for breakfast on Saturday and wish I would have spent my money somewhere else. The buffet was something I wouldn't expect from the Biltmore it was extremely disappointing. It felt like a Holiday inn buffet but they did have an omelette chef. The bacon quality was not great and it was swimming in inches of grease the fruit looked bad. For $24 it was worth about $10. For $30 make your way to the Four Seasons Scottsdale for the weekend buffet and you will be blown away double the size with great specialty items. The view alone is worth the drive. Maybe they could take a lesson from them. Service was good but the food was not.

Price+quality=amazing  I love how they use a slicer to slice meats there. The bread is amazing chewy how a sandwich should be. I want one right now.  The Italian dressing homemade is amazing ask for it.

This place is really cool and unique. First the salsa bar is insane with like 12 different salsas. From sweet to mild to hot. The food is amazing I told the server that whatever they would order is what I want. I got this quesadilla empanada thing that was out of this world. Very small restaurant and the bar is like 3 seats but loved it.

Finally!! I have been meaning to go to the place forever.  Organic cafe with great food and such a great vibe.  Love the cowgirl cookies and the hummus is amazing.  Why can't they open another location closer to scottsdale?

Go here! great value and amazing food! Doesn't look like much from the outside- but give it a chance and come on in! Fantastic lunch specials- Pad Thai is out of this world!! The curry is also not to be missed. Service has been sluggish from time to time- but that's not going to keep me away!!! ENJOY!

Probably wins the award for nicest and cleanest casino in AZ. Though when you consider their compeditors- it's not much of a compition.  I like the newer penny machines. Thank you! Pretty and pleasant and the attendants don't hide out in the back.

Went for lunch after wanting to go here for months and I was impressed.  I got the pan roast combo. It was filled with crab, crawfish, and lots of shrimp. It was almost like a soup but thicker. Seafood in every bite.  I got a 3 on the spicy scale and wish I got about a 5.  The bread is great to dip into the broth.

Great food but can get very pricey because you have to order soooo many dishes to get full.  Nicholas was a great server ask for him and you are sure to have a great night. They leave a menu close by they must know the portions are small.

I do like chipotle but this location is really bad. They are just missing something probably correct training. I arrived at 4pm and ordered and noticed their isn't any veggies when I asked they said they take about 10 minutes so I waited that's cool. When the veggies arrived and they started my burrito it took the girl 3 tries to wrap it and on the 2 time she tried to pawn off the worst wrapped burrito ever with tears in the middle. I told her that this isn't possible to eat and she had someone else make it. This was a bad experience!! Get it together chipotle!!

Took the wife here for happy hour and could not believe the amount of fruit flies surrounding the inside of the restaurant. They were everywhere it kinda made me feel like I was in a dirty ass bar in Mexico.  When I asked the waitress she told me, " it is very normal for a bar to have these  fruit flies." Uhhhhh no not really.  My drink did taste good but swatting flies while drink kinda sucks.  Lets clean this place up.

After a crappy visit here the manager contacted me to invite me back and send me a gift card. I am still looking for my gift card 3 months later. I tried to email the manager with no response what a shitty establishment!

Really amazing burger I had the bbq one and I'm pretty sure they forgot the bbq sauce on it. It was still an amazing burger I highly recommend it. I waited for takeout about 30 minutes.

If you are a vegan or vegetarian I don't know how you don't live here.  The food is amazing here and you will feel like you are eating a juicy burger.  The berry lemonade is a homerun.

I was very surprised how good the food is here. I had a chicken burrito and for the price and quality I really enjoyed it.  The chips and salsa are amazing two different salsas. Happy hour is amazing the only downfall is the atmosphere they had a bootleg UFC fight on every tv. Like the fights you see on a weird channel, Just kinda weird for a Mexican joint. I hope this place stays around I didn't see too many people in here.

Great steak with very reasonable prices. I had the filet with prawns and 2 sides for $26 what a great value.  Comes with homemade breads and pesto garlic dip, and bacon corn bread.  The only downside is very small restaurant and you can hear the casino slots ringing during your whole meal.  Will be back soon.

I really wanted it to be good. I love the concept behind what they do. I love the menu. But the sandwich I got tasted like the worst deli meat ever. I got the turkey club which had only 3 slices of this crap meat.  Chicken looked likethe same chicken as subway. Nasty. Stick to the soups and salads.

I was so blown away by the quality of sushi the had here. The wife and I decided to give this a try looking at yelp for some great reviews. We nailed it and my wife was very happy with me. We opted for the AYCE for lunch and we were sooo happy. We love sushi and we now have a new spot plus they are open until 3am. You must try this place now. Don't let the outside fool you. You will thank me later.

This place is really really good. I was blown away with how much I liked this place. I wish I would have known about this place before. The quality and all the toppings make this place so unique. Pickled onions, slaw, 3 different salsas all fresh. Very clean restaurant and kitchen. I wish the built another location closer to my house. If you going with a baby I'll let you know that there are only 2 high chairs and last night I had to wait for one.

Giving 2 stars based solely that none of there "healthy" drinks are organic.  Which means your drinking poison.  Your better off not drinking this crap.  Please have an option for people who would like organic charge me more.  If people are soooo health conscious that dine at your "healthy" cafe then why aren't they complaining.

I got the beet burger and it was really good wayyy better than green. You can tell they make everything from scratch. The jackfruit side with the sandwich taste like short ribs the texture and flavor were spot on. We will be back soon.

I always love The Joint it's a great place if you have back pain. At $29 for a single visit you can't beat it. They first go over your problems so they can focus on a specific area. The chiropractor was very knowledgeable and understand exactly where and why I am in pain. I have referred several people to The Joint.

I didn't love it the burger was so so the bread tasted stale. The service was bad real bad she seemed annoyed when I asked a question about 1 of the beers.  I think maybe she didn't want to work or was having a shitty day.  Go to rehab burger down the street wayyyyyy better.  Gave it two stars(generously) because good atmosphere game volume was on. The hostess didn't even say bye when we left she was just texting not even looking up.  Good luck surviving in Old Town CB & CB. Teach your staff MANAGER!!

Pros: Really good burgers great flavors. Really good shakes. Ok fries. Local produce, grass fed burgers. If grass fed isn't a big deal to you google the difference and you will only eat grass fed.  Cons: price is high You take a number and sit down after ordering. I wish they had normal servers.   Return factor 90%

I came with my wife and baby at 230 and ordered 3 tacos and it came with a side I never got the happy hour menu and I really wish the waiter informed that it was happy hour before I ordered. Besides that my server was really busy and I could tell. But the food was amazing 5 stars. That happy hour menu is one of the best I've ever seen. The atmosphere is fun and trendy kind of had that 80's cool vibe.

The lunch buffet is amazing they have about 15 selections of Thai food specialties that are all amazing. The price is $9.95 per person its a steal. The owner is great and remembers us.  This has to be the best buffet in Arizona.  The food is always hot and fresh.

Came back here for dinner with the wife and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the service. The food took a very long time and when it came out it was wrong and wasn't really as good as it was the last time.  I think I'm going to stick to the amazing lunch buffet instead of dinner here.

Buttermilk donut is probably the best donut I have ever had. This place is open late so if you the craving stop by. This place is clean and they have a few tables inside.  I did get there one time at 930 and they were closed. I am not sure why the sign says 11 so im not sure if they are always open late.

So after returning the chicken kabobs twice because they weren't cooked I decided I didn't want to try for a third time. I told the owner that my chicken still is pink and his reaction was priceless. He told me people like their chicken undercooked here and I told him the the other food seemed cold he actually started eating food from my plate with his hands. Telling me that my food isn't cold. My wife couldn't believe her eyes and either could I. My wife did like her food but the owner acted like a small child.
