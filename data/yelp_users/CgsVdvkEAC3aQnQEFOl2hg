My co worker picked up lunch for us from this place.  Everybody's food looks great!  I had the best club sandwhich ever with beer battered onion rings.  They have chipotle mayo which is one of my favs.   They also have garlic or parmesean fries.  Other people ordered burgers, ceasar wrap, and reuben sandwhiches.  It all looked amazing.  Now i'm going to be in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon but it's ok i'm a happy camper!  :)

There isn't very many places open in Phoenix past 10pm for a bite to eat.  This diner is open 24 hours and I've been here twice so far. It's a great place to go to get a snack or dessert after the movies or going out.  I've only tried a few things here so far and liked everything. I've tried the hot fudge brownie sundae, chili cheese fries, and the appetizer sampler plate.  All there were pretty good. It hit the spot when I was craving dessert and something greasy. yum! I've heard that the wet fries are pretty good too. It sounds gross but I've heard from two different people that I should give it a try. So, maybe next time!

This review is about hair stylist Carissa at Beauty Brands salon in Paradise Valley.  I live less than a mile from here but had been driving to Arrowhead to get my hair trimmed by Shelby.  I had been wanting to try a new stylist just closer to home.   When I called to make the appointment I asked for a senior stylist who was good with long hair.  I was getting a trim and style.  I wished I had taken a "before" picture so I could post it.  Let me tell you.. I had just rolled out of bed and was looking like one hot mess!  What a transformation.  Carissa made my hair look FABULOUS!!.  She even gave me a scalp massage when she washed my hair and also she took her time blowdrying my hair and made sure it was perfect.  Carissa is very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable.  She seems very focused on her career and told me that she attends regular hair shows and keeps up on the hair trends and techniques. I'm so happy i found a hair stylist so close to my home.

This place is kinda dangerous.  i usually get a hot fudge sundae with caramel and nuts and a chili cheese tator tots with ketchup, onion, and tobasco sauce.  i know, totally weird combo but it works for me.  Delish! and they are open till midnight.

I had heard of this place for a while in AZ.  So i was looking forward to trying it with my the Asian professionals meetup group that I belong to.   I usually get the bibimbap but the one in the hot stone pot.  They actually cook it in the hot stone pot and serve it to you that way.  It was really good.  Pretty similar to the way I get in Korea Town back home in Los Angeles.  Yum!!

I took a tour of this health club over a year ago.  It's very close to my place but I felt like I stepped into a time warp.  The facility is clean but it was so outdated.  I live in a condo complex that has a beautiful pool and gym so for me to spend extra money to join a club it needs to be nice.  When I took the tour the guy that was showing me around gave me a hard sell.  He did mention that the owners of the place owned it outright.  I am wondering why don't they spend the money to update it?  They would get so many more members if it was updated.  I ended up trying the facility out for two months when they had a groupon special and took tennis lessons.  Even though the facility was included with the tennis lessons I couldn't get myself to use the facility.  Even the vibe is pretty dark in there.  Also I got the impression that it was very chaotic and no one really seemed to know what was going on.  The service was not good...

When its 109 degrees outside movie in a/c theater sounds good to me. Midnight in Paris was good  I think this is my favorite Harkins theater. It's in a great location, plenty of parking, older location but totally renovated. It's never super crowded where you will get trampled on like at Tempe Marketplace. The staff is pretty nice and clean restrooms.

The new tennis courts are almost done.  They look really nice and the lights are a lot better now for playing tennis in the evenings. Nicest public courts I've seen!

I usually get the same thing here. I'm"m a creature of habit. I had the summer rolls and drunken dragon noodles. The summer rolls are fantastic. I love their peanut sauce they serve with it. The drunken dragon noodles were the perfect level of spicy tonight. I had it regular hot. I've ordered it Thai hot before and believe you me....I started tearing up it was so hot.  I've had their dinner salad and Thai iced tea here before too. Both were very good. The only thing I don't like about this place is the noise level. It's just one open large dining area with the tables so closely together so extremely noisy.

I hadn't been here in such a long time. The last time I was at a PF Changs was in Honolulu. They have really good happy hour. In Hawaii my favorite drink here is the Aloha Kiss but they didn't have it at this location so I tried the Asian pear mojito. Very refreshing...I like mojitos and I like Asian pears so it's the perfect combo. I tried many different appetizers but my favorite are the fried green beans and fire dumplings.

Like the beef more than.the chicken... Everybody calls this place the pink chicken because the chicken really looks pink.  The food is great.  I don't think that they do substitutions because they charged me the regular price when I asked if i could get rice instead of beans with my meal.  I usually order the combo meal but thought I'd give the all beef a shot.  I love their tortillas and their pico de gallo is just the right amount of spicy for me.  The only thing annoying about this place is that they don't take credit cards.  I have to make a special trip just to the atm before i come here.

I"m so glad we rediscovered this place.  My friend and I had been all grubby painting and were driving around doing an errand on a Sunday early evening when all of a sudden i start feeling bitchy.  Which means my hunger headache was about to hit.  We were in South Scottsdale at the time so we were searching for a place to go as is (pretty grubby) and so we hightailed it to YC's.  I hadn't been here since college which was a lifetime ago.  So glad we came here.  It was really good.  You pick different various meats, veggies, noodles, sauces and they grill it all for you. I totally packed in the bowl.  The price also includes a beverage, side of rice (they have both brown and white), and desert afterwards.  What a deal!    Just fyi....if you can't finish what you got and you have to ask for a to go container they charge like 50 cents for the container.

i've had a membership to massage envy for the past 3-4 years.  When I lived on the west side of town i would go to the one in arrowhead, surprise, and litchfield park locations.  I now regulary go to the moon valley location because i have moved East of the 51.    I'm a fan of deep tissue and i'm very picky about getting massages.  Many years ago, I completed the massage training program at Massage School of Santa Monica.  It's hit and miss.  Once you find a therapist that is good then you need to stick with them.  At the moon valley location i usually book appts with Gary, Lydia, David, or Javier.  Lydia does really good deep tissue.  And she addresses all the issues i have.    My philosophy on resorts and local massage centers is that at the resorts the therapist does not depend on repeat customers.  Many of the clients are resort guests and they receive gift cards for the spa as part of a package or many times when guests are there as part of a work convention etc.  they will receive gift cards to use.   I feel that at local massage centers they depend on repeat business so the therapist makes sure they address all your concerns.  I have never had a great massage at a resort.

I love shaved ice!!!  I came across this place next to Hodori.  After i got my Korean food fix, we found this place next door.  I'm a huge shaved ice fan.  They had the Korean Benzoo desert.  Love it!!!

This location is near my house but there is the original location neary my work.  We order from them all the time at work.  I must eat here at least once a wekk.  I think they have been in business for over 50 yrs. Seriously, I can't get enough of this place.  Sometimes i get withdrawls. I usually order #9 with all rice no beans and 1 chix 1 beef.   Their tortillas are super sinful. you know they have lard in them but who cares..when they are good.  I've also tired the corn and beef tamales.  They also sell them by the dozen frozen too.  It's great during the holidays.  i tried to first cook them in the microwave..lets just say not a bright idea.  It turns out perfect in the rice cooker.   I also like their chocolate chimichangas.  totally sinful..

i usually get take out from this place. I've only tried the pineapple fried rice and pad see ew (which is the large flat noodles with beef). i usually get it extra spicy 4 out of 5 on the spicy scale. when they do make it spicy for me then it's really good. i think I've ordered from this place a total of 10 times and maybe 3 of the times they didn't make it spicy at all. it was bland and i had to put my own spices in it. i was so disappointed.  it's gotten better though after i called and complained that when i order it spicy i mean it and not be disappointed when i get home.

I've been here twice and both times it's been a great experience.  Don't let the name fool you...It's actually an Indian restaurant not Mediterannean.  Great food and great service.  They do not have a liquor license so they allow customers to bring their own wine to drink.  At most Indian restaurants I've been to usually you have to order the naan or rice a la carte.  Here at Kabab Palace if you order a la carte, you also get plain naan and rice with your entree.  I think it's a smart business practice to do that.

I've tried this place about 6-7 times so far.  Love it!!! I've tried the lunch buffet here with my family the day after Thanksgiving and take out is great.  The buffet variety is fantastic and different daily.   My favorite dish here is chicken saag and i always request it extra spicy.   I love their onion naan and mint chutney.  i also like their raita dressing on salads.  I've always experienced wonderful service here.  They have always been really nice.

I really like this Trader Joe's. It's within walking distance to my place in cooler weather of course. The staff is super nice and friendly. I like all the natural personal care products they have. My dog really likes the holistic dog food. I love all the different flavored hummus and the tort they have. I also find the marinated packaged carne asada and Korean bolgogi pretty delicious. Trader Joe's prepared meals are great for people that live alone and they are pretty tasty and come in good portions. The only gripe I have is that they got rid of my special secret sauce. It was the garlic herb sauce in a glass jar and I used it for cooking and everyone used to compliment my shrimp and pasta dishes because of it. People would ask how i made it and i would say "it's my secret sauce" So bummed they discontinued it.

I feel like I'm missing something when I don't come here at least once a week.  love this place!  I can't get enough especially since my friends and I discovered they have a special happy hour menu.  At this point, we don't even need to look at the menu.  I love the chilli naan, chilli paneer, tandoori fish, and samosa.  You might be thinking Whoa...hold on tiger, that's a whole lotta food.  Yes! it is.  I always have leftovers from this place for the next day!  Yum!!!

I've been going to Mr Sushi for the past 5 yrs. They are actually open for lunch on Saturdays. They have the best lunch specials and my favorite rolls i order are the Mexican and New York roll. Love their salad dressing and all the different appetizers.   The only complaint i have about this place is that sometimes they will have a all you can eat night and of course on those nights the place gets packed. They do not seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large number of customers on those nights. They need better planning on those nights. We must have waited at least 30 minutes just to order.

I love this place. The staff is really nice and the car washes are very affordable. During monsoon season where it rains almost every day for a month this place is perfect. I've never been pressured to upgrade to anything here. You can go through the drive through yourself or do the full service car wash. They always have some kind of special going on.

I really like this place.  I am extremely picky about massage and my philosphy on spa services is that I feel that small businesses give extra service because they depend on repeat regular customers  to stay in business.  Resorts are good for the amenities and the experience but I don't think that facials and massages are that great at resorts in my experience because they don't count on you coming back on a regular basis.  The customer is usually there on vacation or work convention etc.  At Tranquil Star,  I had purchased a "buy with me" deal and had the 90 minutes deep tissue massage.  I have gotten regular massages for the past ten years and I think the therapist here is probably one of the best I've tried in AZ.  I have a lot of low back pain, forearms and wrists hurt from too many hours on the computer at work.  He addressed all those issues I had and he made sure that I was happy with the pressure.  I think they are open everyday by appointment only and they have some great summer prices right now.  It's centrally located in old town Scottsdale and parking is plenty (or at least it was on a Sunday afternoon). Even without the "buy with me" deal, it's an excellent value because he has special pricing during the summer.  I've already booked my next appointment!  Seriously though, if it wasn't good I wouldn't give it 4 stars cuz I haven't reviewed many with 4 stars. If you are looking for a really super nice swank atmosphere this isn't the place for you but if you are looking for excellent massage, simple clean atmosphere, and great value, then you need to check this place out....

I have to say that this place has the best apple fritters ever!!!!  Their sandwiches are awesome too!  I don't know about all of them but the tuna on toasted bagel rocks!! you have to get everything on it..  I think they put jalepeno peppers in the sandwich which gives it a little kick.  I used to get it on croissant but the croissant got soggy.  I've also tried the roast beef too and it's pretty good!

I noticed this new Thai place so i was excited to try it out for dinner tonight. I placed an order around 8pm for pick up on the way home from work and the guy that took the order on the phone said pickup orders were taking about 25 minutes.  I showed up at 8:30pm and sat at the bar waiting. He did not let me know it was going to take  longer than he thought or offer me a beverage in the beginning.  Only after i had been sitting and waiting for an additional 25 minutes he offered me ice water.    My order finally came out and I was out the door at 9:05pm and super hungry. I got home and no napkins, no plastic utensils, no to go menu in the bag. I had ordered both dishes 3 out of 5 spicy and the owner on the phone told me that their place was one level spicier than other Thai places.  Well guess what?  it's not and the pineapple fried rice i ordered had no spices whatsoever on it.  It was completely bland.  I called the restaurant to tell him that they messed up the order and didn't' put in any spices whatsoever. The guy replied "i don't know what to tell you, you should have taken some hot sauce".  Excuse me??? you are going to blame your screw up on me?  He did not apologize or even give me an excuse that they were so busy or say well i hope you will try us again or anything like that.   He just hung up on me.  Are you kidding?  This is not good service.  OK newsflash...the food here isn't even that great to make up for the awful service.     Because of my work schedule I tend to eat out pretty often so i work long hours and work too hard for my money to be treated like crap by a restaurant.

First I want to say that this is just my opinion and my personal experience with this moving company and below is the letter I wrote to AMAZON of my experience... I purchased this voucher because I thought that the moving company was a reputable company because they are doing business with Amazon local.  I called the merchant to make an appointment on the phone and they told me that each additional hour was $69.99 and there would be a $70 surcharge for heavy items over 100 pounds.  The owner said that my King sized bed was considered a heavy item so I was prepared to pay the surcharge of $70.  I also let him know that I had 4 small dressers that needed to be moved. I told him they do not weigh 100 pounds. I asked if there were any other surcharges. He said no and everything else was included.  Two men and truck showed up and they said they were going to deduct 45 minutes from my voucher for driving time from their office to pick up location and drive time to the drop off location.  The drop off location is about 15 minutes from pickup location. After the clock started my friend informed me they took a break heating up their breakfast and sat to eat it on my time not before the clock started. Also as soon as they got there the two drivers started complaining about the stairs in my townhouse.  This is not at all professional.  The driver told me that there would be a surchage for the king size bed which I was aware of and I said the 4 dressers were not 100 pounds each.  The driver did not give me an additional estimate on price for the surchage.  The move ended up coming to a finish at 1:30 pm AZ time at the drop off location. They started the clock at 8:45 am and said I had one hour and 17 minutes for voucher time.  I tried to explain to them that they double charged me on the drive time because they had said in the beginning that the 45 minutes included the drive to the drop off address and so the total time needed to be adjusted by 15 minutes since it was included in the 45 minutes of the voucher already. Also they left black dolly marks on the stairs of the old place. They also chiped my blue antique washed dresser on the corner and told me just to put some paint on it when I pointed it out to them.  They did not put my bed together correctly at all.  The headboard is now completely loose so the whole thing squeeks. When I had set the appointment, the owner "Al" said that I had to pay the remainder in cash.  The two guys didn't have change so I ended up not getting any cash back which was $5. The two men also had to take about six phone calls mostly from the owners of the moving company and that took time away from them packing the truck. I called the owner that day which was Wednesday 4/23/14 and he said he wanted to make me happy so he would send the driver over the next day to fix everything.  The driver came over the next day 4/24/14 to clean up the dolly wheel marks but he has yet to come to the new place to repair my blue dresser or to put the bed together correctly. He gave me his cell number and he was responding to my texts but has stopped. And I don't think he will come over to fix it. When the driver came over to clean the dolly wheel marks on the carpet, he said that he understand why I was upset because the Amazon deal was not a good deal and I was taken advantage of (putting it nicely). The driver said the move would have cost me half of what it actually did.  The driver told me that the owner has 3 brothers and they all owned different moving companies and pretty much did the same thing. The $70 heavy items charge is only charged to Amazon local deal customers. He said had I called them directly, I would have only been charged a rate of $59.99 per hour for 2 men with truck no surcharges.  I had a friend call their business to verify the regular price and she was told the same thing.  no surcharges but just a fuel charge for $40.  Basically the Amazon deal is not a good deal its designed to gauge customers and take advantage of customers and this local moving company is taking advantage of the Amazon name because customers think if they are associated with doing business with Amazon they must be reputable.  I actually drove to the address on my receipt from Priority Moving & Storage and it was an apartment complex in a not so nice area of town.  On Friday, 5/2/14, I called the owner again to ask about partial refund of $140 heavy item charge, getting my dresser and bed fixed, as well refund for 15 minutes miscalculation of driving time. He said that his offices were not in an apartment complex and I can make an appointment with him for today Monday 5/5/14 12 noon which I did and he gave me another address.  He said it was a storage facility.  I drove down there and the address is a house which is listed for sale. The back yard had old abandoned trucks. I knocked on the back office door and no one answered.  Beware!
