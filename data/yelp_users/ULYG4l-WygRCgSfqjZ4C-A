My vegetarian boyfriend and I love Pizza Heaven's vegan sausage. He thought I had made a mistake when ordering, but I assured him that I hadn't - it really was vegan sausage. The sauce was flavorful and the crust perfectly baked. The dough ball dessert was terrible (can't remember what it was called), so pass on that. But, the pizza was the best we've ever had.

I recently moved to Moon Valley and had driven past Joey's for the past few months. Tonight I was having dinner with my adult son, so we decided to give it a try. When we walked up, they had a chalk board outside with the specials listed (with no prices). Beware! I ordered the chicken Marsala. It was a generous portion of chicken; however, the sauce tasted canned and it had rubbery canned mushrooms. It was not worth the $17 price for such an average meal. My son ordered the stuffed shells off the chalkboard outside. He got three stuffed shells in a meat sauce. We each got a very "diner-like" dinner salad with some lettuce, a couple of grape tomatoes, and three slices of cucumber. Nothing special at all. The iced tea tasted funny, too. I didn't ask how much the stuffed shells cost when my son ordered them. I was SHOCKED to see that this "special" was $18 for three stuffed shells!!  I will say that on the good side the staff is fantastic. We were well attended throughout our meal, so I left a good tip. But $50 is ridiculous for such a mediocre meal.

A group of three of us went on a Wednesday night for the first time.  I ordered the salisbury steak (one of the Wednesday $10 specials) and it was fantastic.  It was thick and juicy and topped with a wonderful mushroom gravy.  The mashed potatoes were homemade and very, very good.  The meal came with the salad bar which was nicely stocked with fresh items.  It wasn't a large salad bar, but it was perfect for a pre-meal salad.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  She had a lovely accent (Russian maybe?) and made sure we never ran out of beer.  Overall, it was a fun experience and we'll definitely be going back.

Alright, I tried this theater one more time and am so glad I did.  It was a very different experience this time so I have to update my review.  I went with my boyfriend to see The Heat (which was awesome, too).  The popcorn was spectacular this time!!!  I was so excited and it tasted so good that I ordered a refill.  Woo hoo!!  I did not order the unsweetened tea (which wasn't good the two times I previously ordered it), but instead ordered the sweetened raspberry tea.  It was also very good.  And, just because we were uber hungry, we ordered some of their parmesan fries from the appetizer menu.  They were amazing.  I mean, they were really, really amazing!  Everything about this movie experience was wonderful and exactly what I've been wanting all along.  Thank you to AMC for correcting the former issues and making this the 5 Star experience I've been wanting.  I'll be back again and again.

We ordered the chicken schwarma and a starter of hummus.  They have the best pitas.  To die for!  The hummus was perfect.  The schwarma was well seasoned and delicious!  The salad fresh and crunchy.  The rice fluffy and flavorful.  We'll definitely be coming back here again. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the prices are a bit high for a casual restaurant where you order and pick-up from the counter.  But, otherwise, this is a nice  restaurant and I'm glad we gave it a try.

I used to eat at Schlotzky's all the time when I lived in Mesa, so I was happy to find one on this side of town when I moved here.  I eat here at least once a week.  The food is fresh and wonderful.  If you've never had their signature bread (sandwich buns or pizza crust) it's amazing - just like I remember it.  The staff is always friendly and even knows my name now.  It's clean in the diningroom and restroom, also - which is very important.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone wanting a nice change of pace from the typical fast-food experience.

My boyfriend and I went here with friends on a Friday night.  We were anticipating a fun evening out and a yummy meal.  Well, three of the four entrees came out at once and the server told us the other would be here shortly.  Well, fifteen minutes later and it still wasn't here, so we flagged down the server and she said there were problems in the kitchen.  She said they had sent one of the chefs home early (???? it's Friday night at 7:00 PM).  By this time, our three entrees were cold as ice as none of us had touched them as we were waiting for my boyfriend's Ahi tuna entree.  The server told us she would comp us another round of drinks - just what we needed on an empty stomach.  :-(  So, the three of us began eating our cold food.  After at least 30 minutes - it could have been longer - my boyfriend's ahi tuna  finally came out.  It was supposed to be grilled ahi, but had barely been run over a grill.  It wasn't even warm.  My boyfriend told the male server who brought it to the table (a different server than the female we'd had all night) that the ahi wasn't done.  It needed to be grilled more.  The waiter got snippy and said "This is the way we do it at Wild Vines."  I looked at him and said, "Are you really arguing with a customer?"  This guy knew my boyfriend had already been waiting at least 30 minutes PAST the time our entrees had been served.  What a jerk.  He backed off and said he wasn't arguing - he offered to take it back to the kitchen to cook it more.  My boyfriend declined since we were all done with our cold food by this time.  Sometime during this time, an unkempt-looking man with a sleeveless T-shirt, discheveled hair, and a grungy-looking backpack which he slung on the bar arrived.  He didn't look clean at all and we came to understand that he was one of the "chefs."  When our server learned from the male server that there were problems with the ahi, she came over and offered to comp us dessert.  We really didn't want dessert.  We just wanted to leave.  Unbelievably, we had now been there for well over an hour and the only thing they comped us were one round of drinks.  All of our cold meals were full price.  She did point out that she comped the ahi salad - at which point I busted up laughing since it wasn't touched and was sent back to the kitchen immediately.  Wild Vines has potential, for sure.  The cold food we ate would have probably been excellent had it been eaten hot.  What this place lacks most is experienced restaurant management.  If they're going to cater to the wine crowd, then they really need to do an overhaul in how to treat customers, how to expedite food properly, and most importantly, what to do when things turn into a cluster f*$#.  There were any number of ways they could have saved the night (and their reputation) if there had been anyone there who understood the value of the customer experience.  We ended up leaving and going over to Ocho (a Mexican restaurant) where we had excellent margaritas and my boyfriend got a wonderful quesadilla - as he was starving by this time.

I tried this salon for the first time today and I have to say that I'm very impressed.  My nail technician, Mai, was very nice and her work on both my manicure and pedicare was perfect.  The salon is clean and everyone who works there seemed very friendly.  I had a gel manicure and a regular pedicure with flowers and the cost was $50 + tip.  I'll be coming back!

I stopped by Good Fellas Grill last night after reading all the reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed at all.  Ninos is a dynamic restaurant owner - offering everything you'd want in a local hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  He makes you feel instantly welcome with his warm smile and friendly disposition.  I kept thinking about who he reminded me of and it came to me this morning - the Cake Boss.  lol  While I waited for my meal to be prepared, he brought me some delicious potato chicken curry soup.  It was piping hot, wonderfully spicy, and the perfect way to begin the meal.  I ordered the hummus appetizer and the two-meat platter.  Everything was perfect.  The hummus was perfectly seasoned, creamy and rich with garlic.  The pita bread served with it was warm, fresh, and plentiful.  My two-meat platter was tasty, too.  The chicken was tender and juicy (which is difficult to do with chicken breast) and the seasoned ground beef kabab was also very good.  I also enjoyed the mountain of rice - which was basmati (or maybe jasmine).  It was fragrant, light, and fantastic.  I couldn't pass up on the little pistachio bird nest pastries by the register, so bought four of them to take home for later.  Like everything else, they were delicious - so buttery and bursting with yummy goodness.  My boyfriend is a vegetarian and I noticed they had nearly a dozen vegetarian selections including a veggie platter, falafel, hummus, lentil soup, and much, much more.  I can't wait to go back to try a different selection from their vast menu.  With most of their selections under $10 (some even at $7.99), it's affordable enough to make a regular stop.

This is a great value for the money.  My boyfriend and I go here probably three or four times a month.  They have great low carb choices if you stick with soups or salads (some require a little modification, though), but they are very accommodating with that.  If you're not low carbing, then you can enjoy their absolutely wonderful bread and the chocolate-covered strawberry that comes with each meal.  I also really like their unsweetened tropical iced tea (but wished they carried Sweet N' Low and not just Splenda).  I typically get one of their chicken salads or a piping hot bowl of soup.  I really enjoyed their cauliflower cheddar soup.  It was hearty and delicious.  I also like their BBQ chicken salad.

My fiance and I tried Red Thai last night (Saturday) for dinner.  We walked in and were seated right away at a table.  Our initial impression is that the music is way too loud, the anime on two enormous screens is kind of weird, and the oddly long bar actually seemed to have more seating then the restaurant.  The bar goes the entire length of the restaurant with at least 30-40 seats (maybe more).  We were there from 8:00 - 9:00 on a Saturday night.  Every table and booth was taken with restaurant guests, but there were only 3 people at the entire bar when we got there - which dwindled down to one lone guest at the bar who looked to be waiting for their take-out order to be prepared.  On to the ordering.  Our waitress was adequate, but nothing special in terms of service.  We asked for ice tea and were told they don't have any kind other than bottled ice tea - which were both sweetened.  So, we declined and stuck with water.  My fiance ordered the special of the night - which was an udon dish with shrimp.  I asked the waitress what she recommended for a first timer there.  She  asked me if I like spicy food.  I said that I did, so she recommended the pad thai, so I ordered chicken pad thai.  We also ordered an appetizer of coconut shrimp.  The coconut shrimp came fairly quickly and it was excellent.  The two dipping sauces were different from what is normally served with coconut shrimp, but they were both quite tasty.  My fiance's udon dish came out next.  We thought my pad thai would be following quickly behind.  It wasn't.  We noticed several other tables near us in the same predicament - one guest with a hot dish served while the other guests (or guests) were waiting.  So, while several dishes were sitting there getting cold, other guests were stuck waiting.  And it wasn't just a minute or two.  My dish took a full 7 additional minutes to come out.  Other guests also seemed to be annoyed and kept looking over at our table.  When my pad thai finally did arrive, it was delicious.  However, my fiance's udon dish was served with tail-on shrimp.  Now, keep in mind this is a  very saucy dish.  Does the chef expect people to fish the shrimp out of the sauce, and then carefully cut off the tail on the narrow rim of the bowl?  Come on.  It was ridiculous.  In addition, cutting the shrimp left an unsightly mess along the bowl rim.  Ugh.  When the waitress came by to check on us, I asked her how the chef anticipated people to eat the tail-on shrimp in this dish.  She said, "I don't really know.  It's just how he does it."  So, while the food was tasty, there were problems with this restaurant.  They appear to be trying too hard to be something that they're not.  This isn't the Biltmore area.  This is a strip center restaurant between the Ace Hardware and the 99 Cent Store.  The service was marginal and the timing of our meals out of the kitchen was not acceptable.  When we asked about the tail-on shrimp, that would have clued in any experienced server that there was a problem.  This waitress practically chastised us for questioning the chef's decision.  For these reasons, you've been chopped.

I've driven past this restaurant several times on my way home, so thought I would stop by tonight. I was greeted immediately by Ramin, who was friendly and welcoming. The interior is clean and well designed. I loved the music they played.  I ordered an iced tea - which, for me, is a test for all Arizona restaurants. It was delicious and Ramin kept my glass full throughout my meal.  I asked Ramin for a recommendation and he suggested the chicken shawarma. It was excellent and served with rice, hummus, and a salad. I will definitely be back.
