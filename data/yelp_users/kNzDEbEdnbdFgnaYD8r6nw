I think I might have spent a little too long deciding what to include in this post, but as someone who has spent a long time renting and had some pretty miserable experiences, I try to include everything I wish I would have known. Apartment reviews can be TERRIFYING, there are some angry renters out there. Here's what I took from my lovely 10 month stay at Miramonte.  1. This apartment doesn't look like much from the outside, and its nothing fancy for sure, but in my experience the office staff is extremely helpful, the maintenance man is reliable and friendly (eventually I even had no problem giving him permission to enter while I wasn't there) and its very reasonably priced. The interiors are updated with nicer carpet, newer kitchens and they have washer and dryers! big plus for me.  2. The pool is awesome, when it works. They have been having some issues but I do believe its fixed now. The gym is tiny but usually empty.   3. its pretty quiet, most of the time. I lived upstairs and was never bothered by my neighbors noise. But I do believe my downstairs neighbor was slightly annoyed by me (and I am not loud and hardly home.) So Point A--live upstairs. I've found that to be true in EVERY apt complex ive ever lived in. Point B--PLEASE NOTE--THIS IS IMPORTANT--there is an elementary school on the east side of the apartment complex. I lived directly up from the parking lot, facing the school playground, and you could absolutely hear little kids playing in the morning.  It didn't ever bother me because I work all week, I only discovered this when I happened to be home sick one Wednesday. If you work a Monday-Fri 9-5 you really wont notice so I would not let that deter you from moving in. However if you sleep in late during the week, choose your location carefully, don't get a unit that faces the school.   4. The office staff will really try to be accommodating. A new office manager took over a couple months after I moved in and you can really tell she wants people to be happy about the complex. I lived here while in the process of buying a house and definitely did my share of calling the office staff with questions about extending my lease, ending my lease, month to month options, etc. When my house closed 2 months before my lease ended, of course I couldn't get out of my legally binding contract (no surprise to me there) but I was surprised that they were very helpful about my options to sublease it myself or find someone to take over my lease completely. They definitely did as much as they could.   5. Parking for visitors isnt the worst I've seen but it can be difficult. There are always tons of spots open on the south end of the complex, but in the evenings most of the other public ones are taken.   6. Bugs- always a big concern of mine and I would have no shame in admitting if I found them. (see my other apt review, ha!). Honestly, I found one big cockroach about a month after I moved in, called the office, they had the sprayer come and I never saw another one again. (I lived there for 10 months)  7. charges. They WILL charge you for damages done to your walls or carpets, for anything that is not top-notch clean, or anything that isnt as it was when you moved in. But they aren't trying to scam you. Use your common sense on this one, you get a form to fill out when you move in that lists every detail of every room, FILL IT OUT. Keep a copy. Be present when they do the final walk through and you will be aware of any discrepancies. Just be a responsible renter and you will only pay the standard $35 carpet cleaning fee.   Hope that was helpful to anyone considering an apartment here. Granted all experiences and units are different, so if you move in and hate it, whoops. If you move in and like it, as I did, you're welcome.

i will give you the rundown of what i wish i had known before i signed away 12 months of cleanliness and good sleep (i am entering month 5!). If i was still in college i could probably deal, but i unfortunately i am getting older and am a part of the 9-5 crowd. It IS much cheaper now though then when i signed a lease, which might make it more bearable for some.  LOUD. I made friends with the neighbors so i woudn't feel guilty about asking them to SHHH. but we discovered i can even hear when they open and close the drawers in their room--so i don't think its their fault. you hear everything above you and next to you, people are outside all hours of the night, cops, parties, kids yelling, anything. it is NOT a quiet complex.  NO PARKING. You get one space. If you have roommates, good luck. The only spots left over after 7 pm or on the weekends are in the front of the complex.  They have ROACHES.  but they "dont have a roach problem' (to quote the front office employees). so i guess they are not roaches. I think they are the new breed of "dont let people find out that we have a roach problem" roach. San Tropez DOES pay for the exterminator to come every week, which is good.  But we still find little ones in the bathrooms, and B I G ones in the kitchen, at LEAST once a week. Bad. Our apartment is clean. and fairly empty. we dont know where they come from. but i know what they are.  NO CELL RECEPTION! Few people get cell phone reception in our 1st floor apt. (it is partly below ground). It is a DEAD zone for AT&T and Sprint customers, I had to buy a LAND LINE for this reason. Congratulations, though Verizon, you are the most reliable in our household.  It doesn't feel clean. Our unit wasnt cleaned well, if even at ALL when we first moved in so we had to call 4 times to get them to come back. ick.   If you are left with no other options (i strongly urge you to FIND ONE) and have to live here... the upside is that maintenance is quick about fixing your problems and the workout room is usually empty. i suggest a 3rd floor unit so you dont hear as much noise from above you, and a can of Raid for the not-really-roach roaches.

I love Bertha's. I love Bertha's sandwiches so much that i occasionally choose to ignore the fact that I am allergic to gluten and I order a real, gluten-infested bread sandwich. The rest of the time I get salads, and they are so good that I don't even feel bitter about the fact that I am eating a salad only because I can't eat bread.    They also make the best Iced Mochas i have ever had. I've watched them being made and i just can't figure out why--i see the plain old Hershey's syrup going in, but there has GOT to be something else in that bottle.   The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they never even bat an eyelash when i ask for my salad in a to-go box and I'm not to-going (because i like to put the yummy balsamic in it, close the lid, and shake it).  Glorious. I only wish it was open on Sundays (because nothing would be better than Bertha's when you're hungover) and that it was open right now. I can't wait for the Grand Re-opening!

I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS!   Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like.   Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.  There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves.   The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box.   I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!

This is the second time I've seen Dr. McMullen, my first visit was January 2013. I am ashamed to say it took me over a year and a second trip to write this review!   I am EXTREMELY near sighted, (-7.5) i cant even see my face to put on makeup in the morning. I have a very hard time wearing contacts, and for the two years before i visited Dr. McMullen I was wearing my coke bottles..errr, glasses, 85% of the time. Now I can happily say I've been back in my contact lenses for over a year.   Dr. McMullen takes the time to help find a solution no matter how long it takes. He is also extremely personable and his office staff is very friendly as well. They do their best to accommodate your schedule and lifestyle, staying open a little later than most dr offices and even open on Saturdays!  And, my new FAVORITE feature, he has a new machine that takes a photo of your eye so you don't even have to have your eyes dilated anymore! He is always up to date with the latest in technology to keep his patients healthy. But more importantly, i dont feel like im walking into an office that's over the top with gadgets and decor and charges to make up for it. It is very apparent patient health is the number one priority.   There is also a pretty great selection of frames for a Doctors office--Ray Bans, Fendi, and some super cute sunglasses for reasonable prices.   All in all, if you are looking for an Eye Doctor, Choose this one. And if you have insurance, call--they may take it! They are constantly adding new providers so they may not be listed on your insurances website yet.   Sorry for the long review, but when you find a doctor you can trust you want to spread the word. :)

Chelsea is my go-to girl for all things hair. I recommend her to anyone who asks and everyone I send her way always loves her. He listens if you know what you like, or she offers suggestions if you want help. She makes sure my cut, color and style are perfect and recently my ombré color had gotten more compliments than I can count. I have long hair and she always knows exactly what to do with it. We are to the point now that I just sit down in her chair and let her go! She is also a joy to be around and that always makes it better. Make an appointment, you will not regret it!
