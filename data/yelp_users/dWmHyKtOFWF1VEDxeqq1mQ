Great location, excellent selection, and a layout that appeals. It's got a very cozy, homey feeling that would be comfortable to gather and have a small chat.  Unfortunately, the owners or the managers seem to be so in love with their sound system that, whenever they have a musical guest, they ruin the "home" feeling of the establishment, a comfortable hang-out, and turn it into an unsustainable flood of conversation-killing, over-amplified noise.  My disdain of the sound system has turned me off of the Lost Leaf for so long that, whenever it's agreed that "everyone" is going there, I'm not a part of "everyone" and I choose to go home instead.

Happening once a year, this is always a treat, a collection of improvised theater done by troupes throughout the country.  Of course they also feature local performers.  I've sat through the entire event, and have volunteered for the festival as well. These shows will inspire you.

This is an amazing place. The shows they choose to put on are intermittent but always astounding. Their variety show series, the 'Seven Minutes', are an amazing unscreened hodgepodge of amazing experimental theatre, all under 7 minutes. They are also the hosts of the wonderful Bully Mammoth comedy team, and have actor training and writing workshops almost all the time.  Finally, they are an amazing place to showcase art, or to see the creations of local artists.

Came here a few times and enjoyed it. However, I've been coming by the last few Saturday evenings and have never found it open, despite the window claiming openness on Saturdays. The lack of predictable hours (and lack of ANY posted hours) makes this a poor choice for gelato.

Weekends are always a delight at the Torch. Friday and Saturday nights are filled with intriguing improvised theater. Occasionally there are guests from out of town, but mostly the entertainment comes from local performers, most of whom have been trained here. If you're looking to expand your horizons, they also have a drop in workshop every first Saturday of the month, which might whet your appetite for doing more... And classes are available year round!

Marie's willingness to invest in the animals she cares for is above board, a bargain considering the prices she charges. I'm always impressed by how she interacts with animals; her concern and curiosity are always evident.
