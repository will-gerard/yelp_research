Great sushi and near the apartment so very convenient.  Love the atmosphere and the service was well.  Got to do it again and try the Hibachi next time. Oh yeah!

It was okay.  Might have to give it one more try.

Normal lunch spot for me as it is only walking distance from my job.  But the food is great!
