Teds was what I expected to be and more. The food was great. Has that homemade burger flavor and taste to it that I expect at like a bbq. I remember trying the split. The notion rings were really good. Only thing that would make the experience even better if the line was not so long and the ordering process was not a process. Over all really good food for great price.

I usually never ever go to any McDonald's the food always is the same and is never fresh or is stale. So my friends wanted to go here to try the new buttermilk chicken sandwich I figure why not. So we order 2 combo. When we got it. The buns look like they been burned almost like bulk bread. Chicken sand which was dry and distasteful. Also to top things off the French fries taste like they say in the oil for hours. I called the manager and explain to her. She apologize and said yeah we been getting a lot of complain about the oil in the fries tonight. WHY on earth would you still serve them to me or anyone else if you know they don't taste right. Should of have went with my guy and stayed away. Nothing ever changes about these places no matter what location you go to. Let's be honest if there complaint about not making enough. And want a raise. Most likely they are doing a half ass job to start with hence why food always taste awful or stale.

So this is not the first time we came in to eat. Late at night their really nothing else that is open so we don't have much of choice. Every time we come in the service sucks. The staff all look like they are on some Kinda drug. I would seriously drug test every single person who works here. One of the older lady looks like she is about to expire any second. If you want decent service. The day crew is why they even have 3 stars. If you want the full waffle House experience come on down to this location. You will get it. I don't think anyone here know what customer service means.

So bough a brand new Lexus Rc. One I saw on show room floor they soar was mine after paper work confusion and everything finally got done. Hey told me that one sold. So they are getting r Another one. So after getting this other one I had to bring back for them to put the dark badge on. No big deal. I took car home looked at windshield. Saw a mine threw it. Though it was reflection no big deal. Took it back to them. Said I have to go threw insurance since there are pit marks. The car has less then 2000 miles. How can there be pit mark and on top of that windshield came defected ready to begin. Beware check the car inside and out before you buy. Cause once u sign they will not  do anything to help you. I bough an is from them Before as well spent over $10.000 with them I. Just service alone. Seem like they just lost a good customer. When exhaust and cool air intake become Avalaible for my car. I will Be taking it to Penski Lexus in scottsdale or chandler. I do t mind drive. At least there hey do good work and back there products. Please please check car inside out before signing or they will screw you over once you drive off the lot.

i was here for a friend birthday, and like last time the cars were broken, and they skipped us cause they did not have carts for everyone. Also they let someone use a racer name (SUCH A FAG) show how great there customer service is. Save your money. i gave this place several chances already only to be let down every time.

There is one thing this place does right and hat is mess your order up every time. I order number 6 shrimp ranchero. Every other time it come with the tarter sauce. Last serval time they either forgot or one they says some crap like it does not come with it. Btw they need to learn customer service. I would love to see places like this go out of business. He manager on shift has a foulmouth.

Had my usual chicken tender salad. It was good as always but this time they substitute it with the chicken from the sand which in stead. Was very tasty. The manager also came to inform us that the chicken was substitute and not normally served this way. I though it tasted really good. I definitely recommend it if you ever try the crispy chicken salad.

Great place for quick fast cheap sushi, I Love getting the bento box for 10 bucks you get a lot of food. and every 10 box your 11th one is free. Clean friendly staff. They also have a check in system where you can get free food after so many check in. Try spicy crunch roll really good.

Went here for lunch with a few friends. When we went to order the waiter has inform us that they were out of burgers no big deal. then we went to order chicken and they were out as well. SO i decided to get the nathans hot dog with seasons fries, I was then told they were out of season fries too and steak fries was the only option. Then when i finally got my food the bun was hard as a rock. The food here is not that great, ok for hanging out and watching game but don't come here too hungry wings are ok.

This is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Always really friendly staff. The food is always good. And I think the price is is good as well. Given McDonald's for 2 combo comes to 14-17 bucks. For that price. You can go to nice sit down here and eat something good.

Been going here for a long time. Service is usually always good. But as of recent they must of got a new set of crew or staff. Every time I come here they would mess up the order or forget to include my extra sauce that they charge me for. Today was the third time. Come on guys I understand your training new staff but. Come on!! Don't charge me for something your not gonna even give me.

We arrive a waiter takes our drink order. Then informs us. There is a shift change. As we wait for this (2)min change they keep seating ppl around us. Ignore us as they take everyone else drink order and food order. Before us even tho they arrived way way after. We waited about 20 min so finally ask for a check.  Do not come here.

The food was great. Price very decent. Restaurant is very big and nice. Staff looks like they can use a little training still. But I think in time they will get it. Over all if I am in the area again I will certainly come back if I want Vietnamese.

Went here for dinner it's really good and price is not bad at all. Kinda reminds me of yogis grill. The miso soup however was not that good. But the steak and chicken was really good. My buddy had the  shrimp bowl he said nothing too special. Over all for price it's good and filling.

Love this place. Use to always eat at a noodles and company when I visit Missouri I'm so happy there is one here now. If you like spicy. I recommend the Indonesia. Peanut with chicken. Everything is really fresh and good. Our cashier tonight was really nice she was very helpful. Even checked on us to make sure we liked what we got. I will be coming here a lot.
