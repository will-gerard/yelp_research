Whoops, I thought this location just opened up...but I guess I just never went down McDowell for anything.   Anyway, I fall into the category of people who think the food induces yawning. I had the Greek Pita and there was nothing Greek about it. My chicken, though, was NOT dry at all...quite tasty by itself in fact. See, its not that the food here doesn't taste good, its just that its nothing special...a sandwich packed in your lunchbox is just as good as what I had here. This wrap tasted like the thousands of others I've had. (that's right, thousands)   I didn't read reviews before I went, and I did it on purpose. Its right down the street, they serve sandwiches, so I had decided that this is a place that I will find something to like about. Another place to add to my wall-of-menus. But...I will visit 2 more times for a total of 3. 3 strikes and you're out is fair, right?   On the plus side, even though the food was boring, it was still fresh. And if you scratch the dressing, it'll be healthy. But likewise if you scratch the dressing....you might fall asleep while eating.

First things first - the pizza LOOKS better than it tastes.  As you're standing in line either waiting for your pick up or ordering on the spot...you're forced to look at that beautiful pizza.   The cheese looks gooey, the toppings fresh, and the crust crusty.  It looked so good to me that I ended up ordering a slice even though I had already called something else in.   I got ham and pepperoni.  It was honestly irresistible looking in its tray.  But when I got it back to the office I was like, "Oh." I could see that it wasn't as thick as I first thought, and a bit more grease than expected too.  The crust had the consistency that I like - crusty and, well...crusty.  But its taste was less than stellar, just kinda bland and greasy.   So now I know all that glitters isn't gold. Now on to what I actually ordered - the Italian beef.  I never had one like this before - its more like a hoagie than the thing I'm used to getting everywhere else.  The meat was thicker and chunkier (that's what she said), whole slices of green peppers, and really no juice.  Don't get me wrong, though...it tasted great.  Everything was fresh and the meat ended up being very tender and juicy.  I even liked the bread it was on.  But its not my beloved italian beef sandwich I'm used to. I went again the next day. This time I ordered the gyro, with the idea that if they get the gyro wrong I can take them off of my wall of menus. It was a traditional gyro with cucumber sauce, onions, tomato and a soft pita...but it was only ordinary.  Again, it tasted fine and good, but it wasn't one of the best I've had. And like the day before, I got messed up while I was in line looking at the food trays.  This time they had baked wing dings!  50 cent a wing was a bit expensive, but those little things were absolutely delicious!  They were seasoned so well.  And not greasy at all.  So good! Two things about this place that will make me come back more than the food - the service and the prices. The lady that works the cashier has such a warm smile and manner, like an old Italian mama.  And what I assume is the boss/owner was also very friendly and bubbly.   The prices are some of the best in this downtown area that I've found so far.  I mean, under $5 for an Italian beef or a gyro???  When I got the pizza slice and the IB, I only paid like $8.50 or so.  ONE salad costs that much at some places.   There is not a whole lotta room inside and seems to fill up quick, but there is seating outside too.  So to sum it up, If you didn't bring a lunch to work and have about $5, you can go here and have a tasty lunch.  A neat place.

I've had Honey Bears twice.  Both times I got the pulled pork sandwich.  I can't give the sandwich a passing grade.  These were from two different locations, and the same result.  The meat was unseasoned and bland...although juicy and tender enough.  The bun sauce is uneventful.  And for 5 bucks, I want better. The first time I got a sandwich, it was bought to me from the Tempe location.  The 2nd time I went to the Central location.  The service was non-descript, which I guess isn't a bad thing.  The place looked nice, though.  Neat and clean.  And there were a lot of people eating, so the stuff is good to someone...just not me.  I figure if you can't get a pulled pork sandwich right, I'd be an idiot to try your ribs or chicken.  So, I guess Honey Bears is on my Nope-List.  Too bad, cause its so convient from work.   I will, however, go back and try their catfish.  If they get that right, I'll throw another star at them.

Been here twice now with work homies. First time, not bad...second time, wow. I'm slowly getting more experienced with true Mexican food, and my favorite stuff is found at stands/trucks and Mexican greasy spoons.  This is only the second dine-in place I've been to, with the other an authentic restaurant in Tucson. Anyway, my first time here I got mahi tacos and the wings.  I dunno why I ordered the wings or why I thought that'd be a good idea at a Mexican restaurant.  They were only OK, with no real kick or anything to make them unique in any way. The tacos were great, though.  All I can remember is the caramelized onions going so well with the sweet fish.  It was really a great dish. Second time around I got a carne asada chimichanga.   Wow.   There was a spinach queso sauce all on top with melted cheese.  I could've put that sauce on the drink coasters and enjoyed myself.  Unbelievably delicious!  The meat in the chimi was seasoned well and quite tender.  It wasn't a crispy chimi due to the smothering of it in that wonderful sauce, but it all came together to make an incredible meal.  Even the beans were good, and I don't like beans.  Oh and their guacamole...so fresh.  I slathered it on top of the chimi and it impossibly made it even better.  This was honestly the best chimichanga I've ever had. We went during happy hour and sat in a happenin' spot with a DJ and all.  Music was loud but varied and he was taking requests.  We got our theme song 'September' by EWF played and it made for a really good time.   Waiter did his job decently.  No complaints there. The chips and salsa were much better this visit...the chips were actually warm and the salsa thick.  We didn't get refilled as quickly as we'd liked, but oh well. Their menu has a lot of great sounding things on it and makes me want to come back again and again just to taste everything that caught my eye.  The prices...well, this is central Phoenix so I guess they are the norm.  I'm cheap so its a bit much for me.   The coworker we were taking out was super hungry and was really looking forward to coming here.  He left quite happy and I'm glad this place didn't disappoint.

Pillow Chicken.  I saw this mentioned in an earlier review and the name made my eyebrows go up.    All the good reviews and the 2 minute distance from work made me give the place a try.  Glad I did.  First time in, I got the Pillow Chicken and the Boiled Won Tons.  Wow.  It has been quite some time since I've sat down to a meal and said 'wow'.  The Pillow Chicken was a new experience for me.  Stuff (chicken, onions, and some other good stuff) is breaded and fried in little 'pillows', then smothered in this black-pepper sauce.  The smell was one of the best experiences my nose has ever had.  And the taste was as good as the smell.  Garlicy and peppery and yummyery.  I've never had anything quite like that dish.  I will order it again to see if my awesome opinion of it is just tastebud shock. The Boiled Won Tons came like a soup.  I think its just that there is a LOT of sauce, and its subtle enough to be a broth.  Don't know.  All I know is that it was delicious.  Its spicy, but...easy.  That's the word for it.  You feel like a stud for eating so much spicy liquid, but its not going to burn your behind-hole on the way out.  (I know that was in poor taste, oh well)  These two delicious dishes had me wanting more.  so I went back that same week.  This time, I got the Lemon Chicken after the menu told me it was a 'must try'.    ...For Lemon Chicken lovers, yeah it is.  But if you're not that into it in the first place, their offering will not turn you into a fan.  That just isn't my kind of dish.  No complaints, however. The lunch special did come with a soup, though.  I have no clue what the name of it was, but it didn't agree with my taste buds.  No fault of the soup.  Its just not for me.  For what it was, it was fresh, well made, and hot.  Someone out there probably loves it.  My rating states "Yay!  I'm a fan."  I am.  I will be going back again and again trying different dishes.  You don't do that a place that you don't trust your taste buds to.  I just need to stick to things that sound good to me...like BBQ Pork Slices and anything with Prawns in it.  The place itself is nice.  Short on front parking, so go in the back and be careful driving down that narrow alley.  The inside of China Chili is nice and open with plenty chairs and tables...I think there were booths...can't remember.  Its accommodating for large parties...which is what you see mostly at lunch time.  Clean place, too.  The staff were quick to the draw as most have said in their reviews.  While waiting for my food, I watched them wait tables.  Fast.  On point.  However, I can see how some folks would be annoyed.  Its a matter of preference.  Just keep in mind that the staff mean no harm.  Speaking of speed, I got my order in under 10 minutes.  That is consistent with what you all have said.  No cold food.  No re-heated food.  None of the issues that could arise with such turnaround time.  Just good hot food served quick.    I'm so desperate for some good chinese food.  I'm completely Panda Express'd out.  This is right down the street from work and the prices are well...decent.  With tax you're talking like $9 for a lunch special.  Apparently, that's a good price for this part of town.  I just can't get over that Pillow Chicken.  I will recommend it even before I give it a second testing.

I ordered one of China Chili's more pedestrian lunch specials: The House Special Chicken.  It tasted...well, pedestrian.  Don't get me wrong, It was not nasty at all.   I suppose compared to Pillow Chicken, this dish seems like its from a different restaurant altogether. Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.    However, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.    Anyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.  Again, the soup of the day was the one that I cannot eat.  Don't know what this stuff is...but I guess somebody on this planet must like it.  Oh well, I can either hold this place in high regards related to the lone dinner entree I've tried and downgrade it for the few lackluster dishes I've had afterwards...or I can give them a break since most 'lunch combos' are only good enough to fill stomachs at the office and not to wow the tastebuds.    Meh.  The stars remain.  I keep going back...so I guess its accurate to state that:  Yay, I am a fan indeed.

Most people know all about Jamba Juice...this is just a review for the average joe who doesn't usually spend 5 bucks on one beverage.  This location is a hop and a skip away from the office...yet I've only gone here twice.  Reason is the price.  You can't get out of there spending less than $4 on one drink.  That's not my idea of pocket friendly...but, you are getting a really good beverage.  They have all kinds of smoothies and shakes and juices and such.  If its wet, they got it.  Well, not really. But you get my point.  You will definitely find something you like here...and if not, then just create it!  This particular location has great service...at least the three times I've been there (just went during this review!).  All in all, its a treat to be had maybe once or twice a week for us regular folks...if you're a big timer then maybe you go everyday?  Its good good good stuff, that's for sure.

The goods.  The absolute, gyro goods.  I needed a gyro.  I found this joint.  I got a gyro.  I am happy.  Seriously, I don't know about anything else they serve, but the gyros are top tier.  Chicago worthy.  Chocked full of meat and sauce and onions and tomato.  The pita was even good.  Heck, the paper they wrapped it in even tasted good...I mean, uhm...  Anyway, the service was good.  The inside is a joint.  The outside is a joint with joint-like parking.  Next to it is the 'licka' sto' so you can buy some Flamin' Hot chips to go with your gyro.  The only way to eat.  The price is right, too.  My gyro was only $4.60, which is a whole dollar less than my usual gyro spot.  I saw a slider on the dollar menu (you don't usually see dollar menus in places like this) that I will have to partake of.    I would put my name on their gyros anytime, and I fully recommend this place for it.  If you've never been here before, keep an eye peeled for it or you'll pass it up.  Its on the corner of Osborn and 24th...next to the brake/tune up place.

Olympic Gyros retains their 5 star rating, and I'd give them another star if I could.  Like many of you who have reviewed this place, I was contacted by the owner with a thank you and a little background.  That is key for me.  I love when owners care.    I was here not too long ago and got the Italian Beef.  Good.  I told the cook to make it sloppy.  He did so and made it juicy and drippy and soggy...the way I like it.  Alas, this sandwich failed to take me back to Chicago.  BUT...it is still an awesome sandwich.  It just doesn't have the taste I remember from my childhood, which was from a long forgotten hole in the wall that probably isn't there anymore.  Whenever I hear of Italian Beef, I can almost taste that place from back in Chicago's offering.  I was little when I had it, and my uncle's girlfriend gave it to me.  To a little kid, getting something so tasty from such a pretty lady...that sticks in your memory banks.    I have only had one sandwich take me back there.  Olympic Gyros' is still great, though.  I'm just over nostalgic.    I see a review that states this isn't Greek food done well.  I cannot say, because I am ignorant to true Greek cuisine... something I hope to remedy before my days are over.  But this IS Chicago food done well.  This IS greasy spoon done well.  I believe that is what the owner is shooting for.  WHOAWHOAWHOA!!!  Hold up!  How could I forget to talk about the WINGS?!?!  Yes, they have wings now.  I love that they promoted this event.  Awesome specials on the wings going on now.  I think they even gave some away at the very beginning.   Anyway, I got a dozen and a half for under $6.  Yes that's right.  I got naked wings and then a dozen hot.  The hot wings are what you want when you go to get wings.  Not gourmet.  Not high class.  But friggin' good and cheap.  These are the kind of wings that you run and get at like 11 at night when you're playing Spades and need something GOOD.  These are not frilly, froo froo wings.  Just wings.  They will sell many of these.  Because I believe this owner will not rest until he does.  They seemed very excited about the wings' debut, which excited me.  I wish them the best.  They'll definitely continue to get my business.

In my last update, I stated that the Italian Beef didn't quite do it for me.    I just had one today and it was completely awesome.  Totally soaked, and they gave me extra juice to boot.  I've also had a pizza puff and a slider.  The pizza puff was dead on...its all the greasiness and crispiness and gooiness that I remember from the Chi.  The slider was tasty, but don't confuse this with any White Castle offerings.  Both of these are cheap and worth tacking onto any order.  What can I say?  I love this place.

Let's get right to it.  The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.  The Food - I ordered the fire dog, a cheese slider, and fried zucchini. The firedog didn't let me down in the authenticity department.  Good meat, the correct and required condiments (neon relish, celery salt, sport peppers, tomato, mustard, onion. and seedy seed bun), cooked just right, and it smelled up the office when I opened it.   The slider was the ex-factor.  I saw 'slider' and immediately thought White Castles.  But I didn't want to compare it to that, so I slapped my head to get the thought outta there.  Its a little burger with mustard, onions, and cheese.  What makes it special is the way the meat's taste melds with the onions, mustard and especially the bun.  Mine had a little too much mustard...and the bun wasn't a player on the field at all.  In fact, the sub-par bunnage took away from the slider.  BUT, I said I wouldn't compare it to Whitey One Bite's (White Castle's), so for what it is...ITS GOOOOOOD!  You will find yourself wishing you bought 2 or 82 more of them. The zucchini was just filler for the car ride back to the job.  They were greasy and crunchy enough to get me excited at first...but their charm wore off after about 5 of them.  They are little chips of zucchini fried nice and crispy.  The taste of the batter just didn't do it for me, and the flavor of the  zucchini wasn't quite on point.  Doh, I REALLY hate saying anything negative about this place, because of....  The Atmosphere: You know what kind of place you're in when you open the door.  A joint.  Pure joint. Chicago newspaper clips, posters, political campaigns, pennants, whatever you can take from Chicago and stick on a wall.  This is the first time I've walked into a Chicago joint and was actually MOVED.  The place made me a little misty.   I miss Chicago.   This joint made me remember some of my happier times as a kid, when life didn't suck. Its the kind of place you go and sit down with your team or with your buddies or with your kids or with your ma or with your worse enemy.  The SMELL OF GRILLED ONIONS makes everything just fine with the world.  Its the kind of place you go after you've just had some kind of fun, or even some kind of heartache.  Its just the kind of place you can go whenever, for whatever reason.  You feel like you belong here; like the world's bitter and evil hands can't reach you here.  You feel...safe.  Sorry to go off on that tangent, but its just something about the actual establishment itself... Who cares about what the floors look like, or what's in the corners?  Its a joint.  Its got joint floors and joint corners and joint tables and chairs.  Ain't nothing crawling.  Nuff' said.  The Service: After my nostalgic head-trip back to Chi-Town, I had to let the guy at the counter know they had done right by me.  Not much conversation due to the uncanny line that seemingly popped up out of nowhere behind me.  He told me that when I call in an order, "Aw, you ain't gotta wait in line, just come on up."  That was almost the equivalent of him saying "I love ya', man!"  Without the awkwardness.  Oh, when I said I was picking up for 'Mike'...they all went "Mike's here!  Got Mike here!  Get Mike's order!!!  Let's go!"  Maybe its a routine, but it makes a guy feel like a million friggin bucks in a recession.  Let's just say I walked out of there feeling 10 times better than I did before I walked in.  And lastly, an elderly lady came in, and they all knew her name.  The guy immediately asked if she wanted something to drink.  I don't know...that just sat right with me.  The Value: On.  The.  Money.  I kid you not, you got 5 bucks, you can eat...and good.  Get a couple sliders and fries for under 5 bucks.  Or one of the dogs and fries.  You're looking at a little more for an Italian Beef (which I intend to trek back there for), or something like that.  Money is an issue for most people, but you won't hurt yourself having lunch here twice a week.  The Bottom Line: Despite the lack-luster experience with my zucchini and bun, I must say this:  Go here.  Go here often.  Smile when you get to the counter.  Tell them they have a nice place, even though they already know it.  Eat sliders.  Eat dogs.  Eat Frito Pie (and tell me how it was....while you stand a few feet away from me with that corn chip breath).  Sit down here.  Bring friends.  Bring people you don't know that much.  Bring people you don't like that much.  Just see how things turn out.  Your stomach and mouth will be happy.  Your heart will be happier, but perhaps out of a few years.  Write about it.  Talk about it.  Grab a few menus and stick 'em on the board at work.   This place is all right. This place is all right.

Didn't know places like this existed.  I've been missing out all this time!  If you like go karts, you'll love this.  But first thing I want to say is its $20 a go, so...yeah.  Maybe you're a balla of some sort, but that price allows me to partake only about once a month.  Which is ok I guess.  Anyway, just keep a look out for coupons...or even become a member for $20 and take advantage of some really awesome discounts.  That's what I rec.  Ok, so once you finally find the place (off in the cut big time), you go in and fill out waivers...yes, waivers.  You die, ain't they fault.  Haha, you won't die, though.  I really don't see how you could injure yourself here unless you do something ridiculous like jump out of the kart.  Then you get your headsock.  Jokes galore arise from this.    Anyway, first timers will have to watch a short video.  No big deal, just a chance for you to find things in the video to laugh at with your friends, while you sit there with your headsock looking silly.  It really just gives you a chance to scope out the place.  Its clean, bright, but pretty barren.  They have race related stuff on the walls, retro stools, and a few arcade machines, even a pool table.  But it still seems...ah forget it, you come to race anyway.  So you go out to the track area and that's when you're like, YES! You can see this is the real deal.  If you're only used to little kiddie crap karts like at Fiddlestix and places like that, then this kinda will be a big deal to you.  A REAL track that has REAL curves and REAL turns.  The smell of gas and rubber and concrete fills your nose, and the rumble of the engines fills your ears.    You'll go over and pick your size helmet.  You might have to wait til the present race is over, but its not that bad.    These karts are nice to me, since I'm only used to boxes with wheels on them, but others might not think they are good.  I must admit that the first time I went, I had a car that was stupidly hard to turn left in.  Oh, and if you're really tall or big...it can be a little uncomfortable I suppose.    The staff takes care to make sure you're strapped in good.  They don't talk much at all, and aren't the warmest bunch.  But they are attentive and will accomodate you.  You get three laps of practice, which also qualifies you.  Its here when you realize that these aren't kiddie kars.  I don't know what the guys 'in the know' consider fast karts, but these were awesome for me.  Don't know how fast they go, but its enough to get the adrenaline going the whole time.  Curves must be manuevered with thought, cause you'll find yourself spun out or in a stack of tires if you just go all willy-nilly.    You go around 3 times to get a qualifying time.  then they send you off in that order to the start line.  this is cool, makes you feel...cool.  Then you're OFF!!!  As you're going around, you really start thinking about the best way to take the turns as people keep passing you!  All the while, you're pumped up from all the tires screeching and the speed you get in the short straightaways.  Drifting is mad fun, but it doesn't win you races.  If you're really good, you'll go around like 15 times or something.  Time does fly, but afterwards, you feel like you really got your money's worth.  It is well worth the price.  They have printouts to show you what you did (or didn't do).    I can say that the experience was intense for me, being a newbie and used to only slow fun karts.  The excitement lasts well after the race as you brag or save face to your friends/family.    About the rules: i bumped a couple times as a result of not seeing a driver behind me...no complaints by staff.  I guess if you get dumb with just ramming into people, you'll get the boot.    The track is a great size.  I don't know what the standard is for these kinds of places, but this one seems adequate for maximum fun.  I guess the guys who are really serious with this stuff could provide better reviews...but for a guy who just likes to have fun, this place is awesome.  I don't recommend it for smaller kids.  In fact, I think you gotta be a certain height AND age to race...not quite sure about the age.  Also, it can seem kinda intimidating with all the waivers and stuff (in the video, it says 'if you die...' or something - just kidding).  Don't be turned off.  The most harm you can really do is spin out or slam into tires.  And the crew helps you get back on track right away.  The cars are fast but they aren't going to give you a heart attack!  And its all in fun anyway.  You can bet that there will be someone out there slower than you, so don't feel like this is only 'for the big boys'.  Bring your ma...maybe not your grandma, though.  Unless she's the little old lady from pasadena.  Fun, fun, FUN!  Remember the $20 price point, inspect your car's steering before the race, and don't have too big of a head (the helmets are tight), and you will have fun here.

In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet.  I had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. "For this?" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery.  I sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap.  So I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much.  All the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar.  As for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was.  The soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy.  The pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh.  One of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there.  Didn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well.  There is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything.  Something else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see.  Will I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets.  Should you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then.  Good value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price.  If you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe. Stay away if you're used to eating at the Chinese buffet.

Nope, sorry.  I cannot pass anything but the price here.  My bill was $9.99...if it had been 2 pennies more, I'd be mad.    We ended up here after we found out that the Hunan VIII across the street was closed for remodeling until AUGUST:(  I had suggested Hunan VIII after getting coupons and reading decent reviews here...so I was a bit embarrassed by the place being closed (not a short drive for any of us, either).   I could tell by the outside of the place.  Yeah yeah, whatever about judging books by their covers...all that went out the window with this place.  Maybe its because I was really excited about Hunan, but I saw wavy stink lines rising from this place when I pulled up.  Sillyishly, I followed my cousins in...  I looked around as we stood in line and then did the dumbest thing of all...I paid.  Now I'll start my review in the bathroom, because that's where I headed first to check on my lil' cuz who really had to go before we got there I guess.  Kitchen, women's bathroom, men's bathroom, and the door to outside were all in this little hall, which isn't a big deal cause you see that all the time.  But this time, it just seemed...icky, and dark, and foreboding.  And the bathroom had sticky floors.  Minus one star for any establishment.  Get some friggin Pine-sol.  So I finish checking on him and head for the food.  Was it really 70 something dishes there?  I guess, but it didn't really seem like it.  Just looking at everything, it seemed decent, just a little low-budget.  I was ok at that point because I knew I paid only 10 bucks for a buffet.  So I made my plate, and became disappointed with the offerings.  Too many similar chicken dishes.  Too many things with shells that needed peeling.  And upon a closer look at what I was heaping on my plate, it all looked...off. Sat down and realized there was no beverage.  Self-serve; I like self-serve beverages.  Two dispenser machine things, your very basic selections but I guess you don't need that many at a buffet.  But it was so unkempt in this spot...like nothing but kids came up to get drinks with no supervision.  You know what I mean. Finally dug in.   Nope. Potstickers?  So greasy it feels like I STILL need to wipe my mouth. Chicken on a Stick?  That didn't taste like any chicken I've ever had...and if it wasn't chicken, it wasn't pork, beef, or anything else. Pepper Chicken?  All pepper, no chicken taste...and black table pepper at that. Saucy chicken, beef, pork dishes?  All sauces were terrible, all meats tasted like a different, unidentifiable meat.  Not exaggerating. Rangoons?  Plenty of goon; almost ran.  I opened one up and there was this greasy and crumbly 'stuff' in there, and very little of it at that. Wings?  They had hot and regular fried.  Bad texture ruined a halfway decent taste for the fried...and the hot seemed like it had some of the same horrid sauce from other dishes on them. Didn't touch anything with shells.  One of the kids got crab legs...the smallest crab legs I've EVER seen.  She loves crab legs but didn't even finish the 3 she had. Another cuz, gagged on the egg foo young.  I caught the rest picking at their plates with forks, but eventually scarfed it all down due to hunger.  One did say he enjoyed it...but he is easily pleased with food. This was the least I've ever eaten at a buffet.  I couldn't get past how unclean it all seemed, and I'm not usually that kind of out-eater.  I kept tasting the food with the tip of my tongue before I let it all in my mouth, afraid I would taste something extra horrid.   Can't speak of the service.  They came and got plates.  Job done. Food was brought out at a good rate.  The first bad buffet I've been to.  But hey, there were plenty of other customers...well not plenty, but enough.  So oh well.

"I'm sorry...I'm so, so sorry."  That's the apology I gave to myself after a game of laser tag here.  I felt I owed the apology to myself, because SOMETHING was owed to me to take the place of a good time that I had hoped to have here.  Two things blew it for me.  And these are not two petty things.   1.  The guns and vests. 2.  The arcade machines.  The guns suck.  Downright blow chunks.  There is a 'heat sensor' on the bottom of the gun that requires you to hold your sweaty hand over it in order to fire.  I've used guns that you've had to hold with 2 hands, and I don't like it.  Its difficult to snipe people below an elevated opening.  Just try it, you'll see what I mean.   That isn't my main gripe about the gun, though.  When you shoot, you hear nothing.  There is no red laser beam.  Just a dot off in the distance.  Okay, okay, okay.  I'm being anal.  But this is just sub-par with any of the laser tag places I've been.  Its not like I'm an aficionado on laser tag guns, but this one just felt cheap and generic and unfun.  I'm used to guns with your friggin NAME on the back of it, telling you when you've tagged someone, where you tagged them, the name of the person you tagged, and what your current rank in the game is.  Now that's TOP tier laser tag.  Even bottom tier made some type of zapping noise and gave you an actual beam you could see.  The vests didn't even vibrate when you got tagged.  No sound letting you know you're out.  You have to look down to see if you're flashing red to even know if you're hit (and if your team color is already red...then you're just screwed).  All you get is a number for identification.  No cool codenames.  But I will say this...the targets on the vest are actually accurate.  You won't be shooting a shoulder target 20 times to get a hit.   Nothing P's me off more than broken arcade games.  Stratum's has a so-so selection.  Tekken 5 is the highlight.  But...the joystick balls have been stolen.  The Player 1 slot doesn't work.  Garbage. They have a nice selection of racing games...but on the nicest one, the steering wheels are about to come off of the game. There is a neat looking speed bag game...but the dang thing don't work. And yes, there is even the basketball game.  All the balls are flat. Time Crisis 3...but only one side works.  Blasphemy. Area 51...only one side works. Its as if they only want one person at a time to play the games.  Well, at least the air hockey works...though the scoreboard is gonna fall on some little kid probably.    Ok, those are the negatives which brought this place down to 2 stars.  But there are enough positives here that you normal, well-rounded people will probably appreciate enough to come back again.  The place is clean.  Even the arcade.  Well lighted, airy, and it didn't stink like Parmesan cheese.   The service was friendly.  Although the game administrator or "Commander" was a bit unmotivated. I didn't sample the food, nor did I visit the facilities.   The maze is a strong point.  Its awesome.  I can truly say that this is the biggest and most complex maze I've been in.  There were like a million kids in one game, and we all fit in there without running into the same person too many times.  The bases are a little cheesy, but there are sniper points, ramps, hiding spots, dead ends, all the good stuff and a lot of it.  Black lights are in full effect. Unfortunately, just when you find a good spot, the game's over.  It seemed REALLY short to me.  I should've timed it so I could give you all a better idea, but let's just say that I didn't feel I got my money's worth at all.  The games cost $8.  They have deals if you buy more than one game.  THere was some kind of deal restriction for Saturdays though, but only in the afternoon.  I didn't peep the food prices.  Well, I guess I'm just spoiled.  I lived close to 2 laser tag arenas back in Michigan, and both were better than this.  But maybe this is all we've got here.  And if so...they need to step it up...I'm sorry.  I don't give too many bad reviews, but this place stunk up my experience.  Get better guns, have some kind of 'nickname' system, get better vests, and fix the dat-gummed arcade games!  They charge enough to keep the facility up, so do it, yo.

Its not cheap. Its not health-friendly. Its not ideal for vegetarians.  So if you're budget-minded, health-conscious, or a vegetarian...this isn't the place for you.  That being said, I love this place.  Sure the waits on Saturday nights suck, but that's how it is any place you might venture into unless its a little known gem.  But for me, the wait is completely worth it.  I eat whatever the heck I wanna eat, no matter how much heavy cream is in the sauce or how much sugar is in the desert or how much fried is in the fried whatever.  And yeah, I pay for it around the midsection but hey.  Anyhow, the service has always been good, even close to closing time.   Bad service once in awhile is inevitable, and I'm sure I'll receive it here sooner or later, but so far we've been fortunate.  Whether we have a large party or just a couple of us, our food has come out in a timely manner each visit.  And none of us have had cold dishes. One of my cousins even changed her order after she got the first one and didn't like it...the waitress didn't even skip a beat.  So far, I've had mostly pasta/rice dishes.  My favorite dish here at the moment is the something something Gumbo.  Its oddly rich and subtle at the same time, the kind of thing that makes you keep shoveling forkfulls in your mouth just to delight at this combo.  The sauce is creamy but not too heavy with just enough kick.  Like I said its subtle, but at the same time its a great flavor experience. Other dishes I've tried are the New Orleans shrimp something or another, and another cajun type dish.  Both were extremely tasty with HUGE shrimp, pieces of sausage or chicken or whatever was in it.    They DO NOT skimp on the portions.  I've read that some people are actually turned off by this.  I just think that if I'm paying money to eat, I should get as much for that money as possible.  And here, you do.  Last night, we commented on how a dish that costs only $13 could be chocked full of so many big fresh shrimp.  And recently, one of the kids and his dad ordered one of the burgers...this thing was a friggin' MONSTER!  It could eat a human.  And sure it would make any health-conscious person run for the hills, but for the rest of us, this burger would make your eyes get so big your eyeballs might fall out of their sockets.  Let's just say Red Robin's burgers look like White Castles compared to this.  Sadly, this specific burger is no longer on the menu, and to custom do it, they would've charged extra.  So that wasn't cool.  And I think that is the only negative point I might have.  Seriously, I love this place.  Its only got 4 stars cause its not somewhere I can just up and say "let's go!" because of the prices.  Well......let's rethink that.  See, I HAVE to have cheesecake.  After all, it IS the Cheesecake Factory.  Its their defining thingy.  And cheesecake (plus a beverage) is what really rolls my bill over the line.  But is the cheesecake all that???  Oh my friggin goodness, yes.  I cannot speak for all the cheesecakes on the extensive menu, for I simply cannot get past the Banana whatever cheesecake.  This is just the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth.  I won't attempt to describe it, just know that if you like anything to do with bananas, this is for you.  You two were meant to meet.  Destiny.  And about that extensive menu...yeah its big.  Soooo many choices.  They've got pastas, rice dishes, platters, burgers, steaks, seafoods, pizzas (the littlest in our fam ordered a pizza and it was 2 times as big as his head)...and then of course all the appetizers, drinks, and deserts.  I don't know why someone would ever complain about a big menu.  That's beyond me.  So what else?  Uhm, its a good place for a date...although I must say there seems to be so many complete hotties here at any given time, that some unfortunate glances my inevitably happen....so be warned fellas.  I suggest you wear sunglasses. Uhm, the bathrooms were clean each time I went.  Although this last time there was a big line....with food this rich, that is to be expected.   Atmosphere is enjoyable.  Some people may think its a little uppity, but coming from a guy who wears jeans and a t-shirt most days, I'd have to say its ok.  A lot of the teen crowd and early 20s, but its not an obnoxious atmosphere at all.  Its a family place.  So...yeah.  If you can stand to spend about 20 bucks a person, don't care about the calories, and want some really good food and a lot of it, come.

I'm an idiot when it comes to shipping stuff.  So I told the girl behind the counter, "I got this, and I got this.  They go to two different places.  Wut do?"  She basically just took it from there, all with a decent attitude, a couple chuckles, and a cute face.  All I had to do was address some labels and pay.  I only paid like $13 to ship 2 hats and a little box.  Fine with me.    Looked like they have EVERYTHING you could need for any kind of shipping task.  There's all kind of knick-knacks and stuff to buy.  Boxes, labels, pens/markers, this, that, the other.  If you're clueless like me and have no idea what you need in order to ship something, I'm quite sure they got you covered.    I was the only customer at the time, so I don't know how smoothly things go at hectic times there...and all I had to ship were two little things, so I can't speak on the extent of knowledge the staff might have.  But what I had to do went quick and easy, so I'm a fan.

I had their Cheef sandwich and an order of garlic cheese bread.   The Cheef is an Italian Beef sandwich covered in mozzarella cheese! That sounded awesome on the menu and it tasted pretty darn good. It didn't have the best Italian Beef taste for my liking...but keep in mind I am a stuck-up pompous butt-head when it comes to Italian Beefness. The taste was great, don't get me wrong...I think anyone would agree. Also, the meat was stacked higher than Sears Tower...I mean there was A LOT of meat on this bad boy...tender, too. They had the peppers and stuff as is standard, plus the mozzarella. The cheese gave it a sweetness that surprised me. It compliments the flavor of the meat so well that I excused the downfall of the sandwich - the gravy. Two things make or break an Italian Beef for me: the meat and the gravy. The gravy they use is decent, just not top-rate...if they put a little more love in their seasoning of the meat, then this would be the ultimate IB. But still darned good, man.   The garlic cheese bread was better than I expected. Thick and crusty and baked perfectly with gooey cheese and plenty of butter and garlic. Tasted good dipped in the au jour as well, heh heh.   I had this delivered and it all came up to about 12 bucks. Pretty standard. I ordered, then called back cause I forgot to use a coupon and they applied it with no questions asked. Came quickly enough, around your standard 40 minute mark.   Their menu has plenty of pasta options to make me try them again, as well as their pizza that I really would like to try...especially since its supposed to be a pizza 'pie' type deal or 'Chicago style'. And...is that sum Ribz I's sees on dat menu???  Good local food where I can get a decent Italian Beef anytime I want it.

Prices aren't the greatest, somewhere between Fry's and Walmart...I'd rather go to Wal-mart.  Selection isn't too good at this one.  Presentation is only ok most times I've been in here.  They have a red box that actually doesn't see much traffic (awesome).  Their fried chicken is the worst fried chicken I have ever attempted to eat.  It tastes like...ungood.  Their rotisserie chicken is good, though.  Those are the only hot foods I've had here.    I've had good customer service, and I've had bad customer service.  Admittedly more good than bad.  But the bad pissed me off so much, I have avoided Albertson's lately.  Both spots at the customer service desk had the 'closed' sign on them, and I needed a money order.  I asked if there was somewhere else I could get one (like at a cashier or something) and he says dryly, "Right here."  It had the tone behind it as though he were saying, "Yeah right here, retard."  I ignored it and told him how much I needed one for.  "Cash only." he says in that same get-hit-in-the-face tone.  I just said ok, and left.  The problem is that I just got a money order using my plastic not even a month ago.    I guess a review isn't a place to vent, but still.  Look out for the jerk with the yellow glasses on.  And they do have some good sales at times.  And I've also never gotten any less than fresh meat here.

Back in Michigan, Guitar Center was about 5 minutes away from my house.  I used it as a safe-haven from the world; a place to relax my mind.  Straight to the keyboard room I would go...and I'd remain there for hours.  Getting to play around on the cutting edge boards and gadgets was grade-A stress relief for me, and it sort of erased any kind of bad day at work or home. I wasn't aware that there was a Guitar Center in AZ until a guy at a music store told me.  I've been there frequently since.   At any store, customer service is the number one thing for me.  This location has great staff who are willing and actually look forward to helping.  I've found that some sales associates in various stores lose interest in you once they find out you're not really going to buy anything.  Regardless of commission.  But the people at this Guitar Center are friendly, conversational (yeah, its a word), helpful, and knowledgeable.   I recently asked about some discounted studio monitors and ended up in a good 10 minute conversation that yielded some awesome information and stuff that I didn't know.  Also just yesterday I sat down trying to compare some drum machines, and an associate (Bob) came over and went through each of them with me, and actually seemed to be enjoying himself.  That is the kind of customer service that makes you want to come back again and again.   Another point I'd like to make about the staff is that they don't mind you coming in and just farting around with the gear.  They don't have that 'buy something or get out' attitude, which is an attitude that makes me want to cause physical harm.   So yeah, staff gets an A+.  The set-up of the store is a bit cluttered.  But this isn't their fault, the building is tiny.  There is, however, enough room to do whatever it is you want to do,  whether it be mess around with stuff or actually shop.  You might bump into a few folks, but so what.  I have only briefly ventured into the drum section and I will say that it is set up nicely.  My place of choice is the keyboard room, though.  It is a bit more cluttered than the rest of the place, but its not going to hender your experience.  They also have a small assortment of used equipment which the budget-minded musician (aka- the broke musician) can really clean up with.  Not to mention a no-hassle lay-away (15% down), and really cool associates who will 'put stuff aside' for you.  Prices?  Same as any other place.  Haven't done any haggling so I don't if you can make deals.  I love this store, and more particularly, this location.  I've had a bad experience with the one on Gratiot back in Michigan....but that was a long time ago and far, far away.  Oh, and if all music terminology sounds like jibberish to you, these guys WILL be patient, helpful and understanding.  You can't ask for anything more.

Hmph, fiddle sticks.  I've been here four times over the course of about 2 years. Nothing has improved since my first visit. The rides are rickety. The go-karts are junk. The mini-golf is pathetic. The sitting areas and tables are in poor display. And to make it all worse, the prices seem to have gone up.   This place suffers from lack of care. Simple as that. There is no other reason for decaying ceiling tiles that barely hold up the dusty and out-dated 'prizes'.  No need for the sitting areas to have tables that are two different colors - faded blue and rust. There is no need for entire patches to be missing from the putting greens.   Kids still seem to like this place...as long as their having fun, I guess whatever is whatever. But while standing around waiting on the tikes to tire out, I couldn't do anything but look around at the decay of this place. (not like any of the arcade games gave me something more to do)   Even my 14-year old cousin was content just standing around pointing out bad things along with me. We kinda wanted to play mini-golf but the disrepair of the courses turned us off.  I was talking with one of the workers and out of the blue, he perked up and said "Oh, and they finally got the water running through the mini-golf!" Then he frowned and said, "At least, I think they do..." They didn't.  And the fact that he was excited over something that should never be an issue pretty much said it all.   I don't know if that Saturday afternoon they were just understaffed...but repeatedly little kids had to wait way too long for someone to come and man the kiddie karts. I counted at least 5 people walk away with their kids, in just about a half hour. And once they did get to go, only 3 karts worked with one of them needing to be put out of its misery. But there was no one to man it because the guy was too busy manning the regular go-karts. We were there for over 4 hours and he pulled double duty the whole time. And its not like someone who was supposed to be working was somewhere goofing off - there just wasn't anyone else to help. I have to give the workers kudos for working hard that day. The go-kart guy took the time to help one really tiny girl make her way around the track twice, and for his age, you don't usually see that kind of dedication.  I also saw the guy that got stuck with birthday party host duties tirelessly keeping track of every guest and making sure they got what they wanted.  The bumper boats didn't bump, they gently touched. They did squirt water though...the kids had more fun squirting water at people standing in line than they did bumping.   There was a little "roller-coaster" that every time it started up, it sounded like a mack truck had busted into the place and was screeching its brakes while running down every man, woman, and child.   I didn't visit the batting cages or the driving range, but last time I did use the batting cages, they malfunctioned more than a few times. And lets not get started on the condition of the equipment.   Inside, there is no fun to be had by people over 11. Outdated arcade games that ate tokens are what you'll find. Plus some standard skeeball and hoops which worked decently enough. The ticket games are there, too...albeit old. Its enough to keep smaller kids busy and entertained. And I guess that's all there needs to be, eh?  Their event area is as bland as you can get, but big enough to accommodate two parties at once...though you'd be so close together you might end up taking the wrong kid home. For eating, there are tables crappily placed as you walk in, perfect for all the kids in line to stare at you as you try to eat or for people's booties to land right in your nachos.  I don't remember the bathrooms.   I got some Icees but refrained from buying food, even though my 10 yr old cuz kept begging for french fries. Let's just say everything was priced $2 too much, and I wasn't too sure about eating anything prepared in the place.   So bottom line, its a runned down place with no personality other than ghetto; no care or effort put into the appearance; malfunctioning equipment and tacky everything else; kids seem to have fun; staff was hard-working and friendly; overpriced; not fun for adults.   I can't recommend it. Now that their prices are so high, you might as well go to Gameworks.

DISCLAIMER: This isn't really a review.  I only got soup from here (had my stupid tooth pulled the day before), so I can't really make an honest review.  So this is just a few feelings and vibes I got from the place.  I was shocked into wide-eyedness upon opening the doors to this place.  I thought it was just a little deli.  Remember folks, I'm new to Phoenix so I don't know stuff.  But this place is HUGE!!!  And BUSY!!!  And...HUGE!!!  When my eyes finally registered what was in front of me, I was like "Wow, really?!  A cafeteria line?!  Sweet!"  I literally stumbled a bit out of surprise.  A wrap around line on one side, and then another around the corner.  I think there was like a drink station on the other side.    I thought this was going to take a while, but NO WAY!  That line moved faster than a line for free stimulus checks signed by Obama himself.  The guys behind the glass know what the heck they are doing.  You get the feeling these guys went to school somewhere for sandwich making.  (I actually just Googled 'universities with sandwich names' so I could insert a joke here...to no avail) The swiftness with which these guys and gals slapped those sandwiches together made me smile and look on like a kid.  It was exciting.  It was fun.  No joke.  The soup was only like 3 bucks, but the sandwiches and entrees got a little expensive.  You'll get outta there about $10 lighter.  For lunch just for one day, that's a bit much for me.  But MANOHMAN!!!  The meat looked so juicy and tender and scrumptious...I wanted to hold everyone up at gun point so I could make away with all the meat.    The price is high, but the sandwiches that I saw moving along that slider were stacked just as high.  You'll get your money's worth.  A place is doing something right when they make you want to come back asap.  I mean like tomorrow.  I hope the food is as good as it looks, or as good as the herds of people spilling in and out of there suggest it is...

A 'Burger Factory' you say?  Am I to understand that this is a factory that produces burgers?  Away post-haste!  Right down the street from work (everything is right down the street from work) is The Burger Factory, a place that fills my head with visions of little burgers riding down a conveyor belt.  First comes the bottom bun, then a machine delicately places a few drops of sauce on it, then another machine spreads it with precision, then the next robot arm gently places a patty, then next one puts the lettuce on top of that, then another one puts on the onions, the next robotic arm is poised to place bacon if needed, then comes the cheese machine, then the last machine places a top bun on it and pats it lovingly.  Then the complete burger continues its ride on the conveyor belt to a final machine which quickly and accurately boxes the burger, then stamps it with an 'ACME' stamp.  Bugs Bunny takes the boxed burger over to a drive thru window and gives it to the customer... ok, i'm bored at work doing stupid spreadsheets, so my mind is wandering!  Anyway, you don't get to see Bugs Bunny, but you do get food prepared with precision and quality assurance.    First, I was impressed with the number of items on the menu.  A varied variety of various burgers, some sandwich staples, Mexican food, greasy spoon dinners, and even breakfast.  Whether or not they do all of these categories well...I vow to find out and report.  So far, I've had a Philly Cheese Steak and a gyro from here.    I haven't been satisfied with a cheese steak in a very long time, but the Factory has come the closest to getting it right for me.  Tender meat, gooey cheese, and enough of it.  Peppers and onions were grilled to carmelized goodnes.  And the bread was even good.  The taste was right on point...the perfect balance of savory and sweet and devilish.  It wasn't a little boy's size, either.  I got full.  The gyro?  If anyone has ever read my reviews of gyro joints, they know I love the things more than I love my family.  Factory's gyro was...big.  That's the most memorable thing about it.  The taste was just average.  Not bad at all, but it doesn't rank in MY top 5.  Its got everything that a gyro should have...meat, onions, sauce, pita.  And lots of it all.  But like I said, the taste is only ok.  Ah, I need to get over myself I think.  Most people would find this gyro superb.  When a place has you looking forward to coming back and trying more, they've pretty much done their job.  These guys are quick with the orders and the price is not too bad at all...I'd say a complete lunch for about 8 bucks?  I like that they are open early for breakfast, because my only other options are McDonald's, The Good Egg (waaaaay too expensive), and some other places that I probably have yet to discover in this area.  Hopefully, I'll be trying their breakfast soon as they offer all the omletes that I like, and pancakes, too.  I think this is one of those places that you keep trying stuff on the menu until you come accross something you really don't like, then you just stick with what's been good to you.

I don't know any history about the Berto stuff.  I've had Fili and Eri.   I like Eri better. Been here maybe 6 times for lunch.    One reason I like this place is the prices.  I can get way too full and for under $5.  Their burritos top out at $4.99 so that's some good cheap eatin'.  It can cost a dollar, but if it tastes like a dollar then its still no good.  So the main reason I love this place is because everything I've gotten here has tasted like gold nuggets.    First thing I got was the nachos.  'Big' is too few letters in a word to describe the serving size.  3 people can eat off that thing easily...and I mean 3 of ME.  Loaded, man.  The meat (think I got carne asada) was juicy and tender and ALL OVER THE PLACE...under chips, in the corner, at the bottom, etc.  Not just a few strips of meat on top then fluff to fill it out.  That order of nachos was the best I've ever had from anywhere.  Then I got a two tacos - carne asada and abodaba (or whatever).  Again, the serving size was way more than enough for a big guy and there was enough meat and goodie falling off of each taco, that you could make two new tacos.  And oh man, the taste.  Once again - juicy, tender, mondo flavorful.  Just crazy good.  The next few times, I stuck with those taco choices, then I tried the breakfast burrito.  Sweet heavens.  I don't even like breakfast burritos, but this one is a must whenever I'm in the office on a weekend early.  Huge.  Like "that's what she said" huge.  Heavy.  Chock full.  Juicy.  I honestly haven't had anything that perfect for breakfast before.  This will either keep you going until dinner, or put you to sleep until dinner.  Actually, I don't remember exactly what was in it, but it was everything good.  Everything good.  Finally, the king of all things.  Carnitas.  First time I got a carnitas burrito from here, I danced.  I wanted to sing but...no.  No exaggeration - this was the best burrito I've ever had in my life.  And it was really due to the meat.  Crispy pork that's tender and juicy at the same time?  C'mon now.  I have no choice but to love it.  I would just end up picking the meat out just savor how wonderful the texture and flavor were.  This was my first experience with carnitas and now I haven't ordered anything but carnitas this and carnitast that since.  Today I had two crispy shell carnitas tacos.  Again, I danced.    If there is carnitas out there that tastes better than this, I must find it.  I must be informed.  Anyone reading this review is now obligated to update me, because you will fall and break your spleen if you don't.  Cheap.  Huge portions.  Perfectly tasty.  This place is a winner.  And I like it way better than the other berto thing.  And drive thru.  Yep.

I tried the Pad-Thai.  Not that great.  The sauce was...somewhat bitter and past that it didn't get any better.  Noodles were cooked well, so was the beef and the brocolli.  Its just the sauce was bad.  Price was ok.  I mean, I didn't order from the lunch menu so it was around 9 bucks or so.  But the portion was nice, really nice in fact.    I really was hoping for a better dish.  Perhaps I need to try something they are more known for, like one of their curries.    Service was good.  Friendly when they took my order and when they gave me my food.    I guess I just need to try a different dish.  But pad-thai is one of my favorites and they didn't get it right.  Oh well.  Their curry reputation is reason to go back.  Hopefully an updated awaits.

This is a hotel for people who need a place to sleep for the night, and they need it cheaply, and quickly.   Yes, it is supposed to be an 'extended stay' type place, but I would not recommend it for staying longer than a couple nights.   The area is not a place I'd live in, but its not the worse place I've been by a long shot.  Its Phoenix, and not the good part.  So yeah, you pretty much know what you get.  But if you're from out of town then I guess you don't.  Let's just say to expect inner city atmosphere...the uneasy, look over your shoulder kind. The hotel itself is the outside kind, where you walk into your room from the outside.  I don't like these kinds of places (apartments included).  I guess I feel exposed or whatever.  Meh.  The size of the room is itty bitty.  But if you're traveling by yourself, then it is adequate.  The bathroom is also small but good enough for what you gotta do.  The bed in mine was a queen size.  And there is a small kitchenette.    Cleanliness?  This is where I had my problem.  I saw a few roaches.  I am not an uppity person, but I'd rather not pay to sleep with roaches...even if I'm not paying that much.  I found one in the kitchenette sink which fled behind the coffee pot, then into the cabinet, then under the stovetop.  Another one was found coming out of the drain in the shower.  Maybe two roaches aren't bad for most people especially considering where I was and how much I was spending...but that's one too many for me.  The roaches were, however, the only cleanliness issue I had.  Comfort?  Uhm....the bed felt like a box, but its better than having nowhere to sleep at all.  It creaked and groaned like the dickens, though.  There was a nice little table to use as a desk/dining table/ironing board.  The 'sitting chair' in the room I used as a place to put my stuff so I wouldn't have to sit everything on the floor and risk carrying roaches around with me.  Features?  The kitchenette was nice to have even though I didn't use it.  It has a little 2 burner stovetop, a little sink, a little fridge, a little coffee maker, and a little microwave.  Pots, pans, and utensils were also supplied.  I didn't inspect the cleanliness of any of that stuff cause I knew I wouldn't use them...and roaches had probably skimpered over it all anyway.  The tv was little, like a 13 inch.  It had Showtime stations, and a bunch of others like TNT, TBS, all the ESPN you could want, Cartoon Network, and the regular stations.  There were more but nothing I watch.  There was no iron, which sucked.    Service?  I didn't get it.  Room service only comes by on the 6th or 7th day.  So if you need new towels, toilet paper, shampoo and the like, you had to go to the office to get it.  And there was no garbage can in the room other than a tiny one in the bathroom...so all my garbage went in a Walmart bag.  Then another Walmart bag.  And another.  When I left, I had three bags of garbage sitting for them.    I had noisy neighbors my entire stay.  I have no idea what they were throwing around at 3am.  Its like they were stomping whenever they walked.  And someone MUST have been banging on the walls somewhere nearby.  So peaceful, it ain't.  I found a different, better hotel along the way and checked out of here a few days early.  They refunded my money without even blinking.  So...  If you're in a bind like I am and money is an issue, this will suit your needs.  There were only 2 roaches in my 3 days there.  The kitchenette is a great value.  If you don't mind the area then this is a decent choice.

Skimming the reviews I kept seeing "cheap", "value", etc.  Without a doubt. Let's just say I pretty much splurged and still came in under $15.  I got: Special Combo - $3.25 Grilled Pork - $3.05 5pc Egg roll - $3.25 5pc Wings - $2.75  In the car, I started popping egg rolls.  I actually ordered spring rolls, but I'm glad they gave me these little fried wonders instead.  Honestly, I don't know the difference between lumpia and these things, but lumpia is what these were like.  Mini rolled up, perfectly fried with that paper-like exterior, filled with that yum yum shrimp stuff.  The crunch was perfect.  And the filling was flavorful.  I'd like a room in a lair somewhere filled with nothing but these things, that I could jump into and swim in like Scrooge McDuck does his gold. Waited til I got home to try the wings.  But while I was in the car, I peeked in the bag and saw they were perfectly fried.  The smell from them was that Asian fried chicken wing smell - I dunno, its just the best to me.  There was this little wall hole Chinese food place back in Michigan...they had little business and eventually went under.  But their chicken wings were the BEST asian wings I ever had.  These smelled like those, and when I bit into one, I knew I'd be back to Lee's over and over again if only for these wings.  Nothing fancy, trust me.  Most folks would say they are no big deal.  But they have the specific seasoning and texture that I love in asian wings.  Perfect.  Now believe it or not, the only little let down for me were the actual sandwiches.    Both were just really lacking in the quantity of stuff they packed in the bagbread.  Like little slivers of meat.  To be fair though, you're paying under $4 for a 8 in sandwich.  Also, the flavor was still great.  I'd never had these combinations of meat and vegs in a sub-like thingy.  The head cheese on the special combo took me back to being a kid raiding the fridge for Pops' hot head cheese.  I had never had pate or jambon before...and to be honest, I still don't know what they taste like by themselves.  All the flavors just melded into one big perfect taste that I want more of.  The pork sandwich was also blasty flavored.  That tender pork's flavor powered through all other flavors and dragged the rest of them along behind it straight into my taste buds' houses.    Can't say much more about how flavorful their sandwiches are.  Just wish they gave you more filling, but then the prices would go up:(  Perfect fried appetizers, flavors like nobody's biz, and a price that a cheap-o can appreciate.  Oh and the facility itself is big, bright, and appeared clean.  A lot of room to eat in, and also a few different stations (closed by time i got there) made it almost seem like a cafeteria or something.  Brightly inviting.  The service was non-descript, and like I said I got fried shrimp rolls instead of spring rolls, but whatever.  And they don't take credit, but there's an ATM right in the place.  They did their job by making want to try every sandwich they offer.  I also am intrigued with their drink offerings.  The mark of a good food place is when they leave you excited to get back there!

Well I have since learned that getting double meats is the way to go...and you'll still be coming in under $5. I tried the special combo with double meats...wow.  The flavors that already were awesome were even more so.  Doubly. I've also had the grass jelly drink.  Again, wow.  It is friggin' delicious.  I think its called Milk Mint Jelly???  Whatever its called, its such a refreshing drink.  And the grass jelly makes it fun. With value, quality, and taste all coming together, I've given 5 stars now.

I hated chinese food when i was a kid.  My mother and aunt ordered the stuff like every weekend, when I wanted Pizza Hut instead.  But I can still remember all those old ghetto chinese food joints, with sticky floors and bullet-proof glass.  Why anyone would trust anything coming out of such seemingly dirty holes in the walls is a matter which would be ideal for philosphers world-wide...yet these kinds of places offer the best chinese food you can find. I'm not on the south side of Chicago anymore, but I work in central Phoenix... I had to ask around, and I also had to use the actualy term 'ghetto chinese food' to finally find what I was looking for.  Siu Wok is the closest thing I could find.  What's ghetto chinese food?  Big portions.  Low prices.  No frills.  Nothing complicated.  Siu Wok hits all these, but in a nice and clean and respectful kind of way (read as: no bullet-proof glass).  I've only ordered lunch specials, so I've paid no more than $7 here ever.  Ordered three times so far.  They have won 2 times out of 3.  I'll tell you about their only loss.  It was sweet and sour pork.  Just bland and fit for cutting up and feeding to baby/dog.  I mean, no distinct flavor at all.  The sauce was orange water with sugar and vinegar in it.  The pork was tender, but the breading was like brown paper.  Just not good at all.  But the wins were indeed wins.  The curry chicken was major yummy, as was the almond chicken.  Both had great sauce and tender chicken.  However, the almond chicken was not what I'm used to.  I like the kind with breaded chicken strips, but this had just the naked stir-fried chicken.  But it was good!    The prices for the lunch specials are perfect - around $6-7.  I've only done pick-up, but I've never had to wait for my food.  The inside of the place is surprisingly clean, bright, and comfy.  Service is always friendly.    The parking can be a challenge at peak lunch hours...just bring a tank and park on TOP of someone else's vehicle.  Oh, and I think its neat that they give you 2 little cream puffs along with your egg roll (average egg roll flavor, but not bad).    Its not ghetto as I like it (food not as greasy, no fear for one's life, no dark corners with questionable contents) but its good lunch-time eating.

This is just about a weekly stop for me now, and I can't see any good reason not to give them 5 stars. The food is always fresh, always a generous portion, and always made quickly.  I'm always pleased with the HUGE pieces of meat they have in their dishes and the freshness of their vegetables.  Aside from that one disappointing sweet and sour pork order, I've gotten nothing but gems from Siu Wok.  Best in the area.

The most awesome experience I've had with wings came in Atlanta back in like 94' or something.  There was this little shack outside our hotel that sold a dozen wings for like $6 or something.  They were the best wings I've ever had.  Fried perfectly and with a sauce hot enough to know I'm eating buffalo wings but tasty as well.  We must have gone through at least 9 dozen wings.  No exaggeration.  Long Wong's wings are the first to remind me of that little shack.  Partly because it really is a little shack itself.  But the wings there are simple and effective, something that I haven't found in a buffalo wing since.  Sure the place is a dive, but what else does it need to be?  You're in the middle of Phoenix.  You're hungry for wings.  You don't need Native New Yorker type atmosphere.  You just need wings that are good and won't break the bank.  Long Wong's ain't pretty, but they fit the bill for some affordable and top-notch grub.  They've got some other things on the menu...a couple chinese dishes and some stuff that I can't remember now.  Its not important.  You come here for wings.  Oh, there are burgers that people seem to enjoy as well.  Maybe I'll check them out next time.  Little joints like this tend to have good burgers for some reason...nice and greasy!  Anyway, for under 7 bucks you can get a dozen wings.  If you're a kind person, the lady behind the counter can tell...she'll give you a free ranch.  If you come in there with an attitude or like the rest of the world is here to serve you, you get no free ranch.  She doesn't say much, she doesn't smile much, but she gave me free ranch.  So she's a saint in my book. It took about 7 minutes to get my food, which is perfect when I'm on a quick lunch.  There was one other person in front of me, so that's really a good time frame.  I have to mention that it was cash only...don't know if this is all the time, but that day there was a sign stating no plastic.  A small inconvenience.  There's about 5 chairs in there so you'll probably be standing around while waiting.  I guess there is a back area you can wait in, too.  Though it looks as if you're not supposed to be in there or something.    Got my little styrofoam container and got back to the desk.  I opened the lid and the smell of correctness filled my cubicle and drifted throughout the office.  The aroma took me back to that little shack. Presentation was surprisingly included here.  They had the little red and white paper in there on the bottom of the container, and celery and stuff, too.  Nice touch. I grabbed a wing.  It was crispy.  Heavy.  Big.  A real piece of chicken.  Not those mini-wing dings I've gotten at some inappropriate places. Took a bite.   Heaven. I was back in Atlanta in 1994. I was amazed and utterly pleased.  This was the buffalo wing I'd been patiently waiting for since the shack.  And I found it not at Native's.  Not Buffalo Wild Wings.  Not anywhere else but a little hole in the wall joint called Long Wong's.   Life is full of quirky surprises. Crunchy.  Even after they'd sat in the sealed container steaming while I went to purchase a beverage. Juicy.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, no undone or overdone stuff here. Tasty.  Delicious isn't a great enough word.  These wings were simply perfect.  The sauce (i saw the lady pour it out of one of many jugs they have in the back) is honest and humble and simple and real.  No frilly stuff.  No Sweet and Sassy this, or 5 Alarm that.  Just some good stuff.  I'd eat a tire if you fried it and put this stuff on it. What more could you ask for?  There is nothing fancy about Long wong's whatsoever.  Just the perfect wings.  I noticed some awards posted around the joint for their wings.  Rightly so.  To get the best tasting wings in the city for this price makes this joint my new indulgence.  So long, diet.  Hello buffalo wing paradise.

What's better than a buffet?  Eat.  Eat.  Eat.  No one can tell you to stop.  And the food just...doesn't...run...out.   Seriously, this buffet has excellent food.  What good is all you can eat if what you're eating is nasty?  I thoroughly went through each entree they serve and I can honestly say that each is tasty.  All sauces were right on - no overpowering knock your socks off in a bad way kind of stuff.  Meats were juicy, or crunchy, whichever they are supposed to be.  I didn't try any of the soups as they are not my thing.  They even have a made-to-order grill and plenty of sushi choices.   The set up is great.  I think there are like 4 main rows of grub, and then there is the specialty section in the back along with the deserts.  Yes, they have chicken feet!  The dining area is roomy and open, enough room for people to march back and forth with over-heaping plates of goodness and not run into eachother.  Haven't visited the bathroom yet...can't comment. One thing that i want to point out that is very important is that during dinner hours, food is replenished at an AWESOME rate.  I love fried shrimp, and I usually end up putting most of the vat on my plate.  My cousin also loves them, and I rubbed it in that I had got them all before he could get to em'.  But he came back to the table about 2 minutes later with a plate full of fresh, hot shrimpies.  The same goes for all the food, even the fruit and jello, which are sometimes left for dead out there at some buffets.  Service?  Its a buffet.  All they need to do is seat you, bring your drinks, and smile.  Done, done, and done.  No complaints.  We asked our server to split the bill like 10,000 ways and he didn't even blink.   I guess I'm cheap.  And $13 is a little steep.  I know most people have no problem with that price, and I probably shouldn't either, especially considering how great the food is.  Ah, I'm just a penny-pincher.

Good grief.  Good, wonderful, awesome grief.  I've been to the El Rancho on 19th in Phoenix.  I was all smiles then.   Even more-so here.  Screw the groceries.  Head to the left towards that smell of stewed meats, seafood salads, sweet stuff, and salsas.  That is where 'its' at, whatever 'it' may be for you.  My second time at this location, and...I still wasn't able to magically learn Spanish upon entering the place, like it seems like I would be able to.  So trying to find out what a specific meat in a specific sauce actually is, that's kind of an adventure in its own.  I go there mainly for what I FINALLY found out is cueritos, but I STILL don't know what to put it in or how to serve it.  So I just grab a fistful of it out of the bag and down it.  Works for me.  Ceviche was new to me until I was given a sample by the nice lady who noticed me staring at it (first visit)...second visit I went to purchase two pounds for our work potluck.  Both first visit lady and second visit lady were helpful and friendly...only second visit lady spoke English regularly.  I felt like taking her around the store with me to answer me every time I said "What IS that?"  The reviews show that people really like the place, but they love the atmosphere...  Is it just that its different?  So...why don't we embrace PEOPLE that are different in the same way we embrace a friggin GROCERY STORE that is different?  Coming here makes me want to get to know more about this different culture...the people, the food, and the food again.  You don't really want to leave.  So what if you can't speak Spanish, like the other folks here say, just point and nod.  Start at the first tray in the long cases of food and try a different one each visit.  Why not?  Everything is priced for those who got pocket change.  To heck with Taco Bell...I can get a whole package of tostada shells, the meat, and some salsa for less than a doggoned 'Bel Grande' combo.    Also, when I look over yonder to parts of the store yet explored (can't get out of that food section), I see the freshest looking meats I've ever seen in any store's meat section.  I can see how red and fresh the meats are from across the store.    That brings me to the pride you'll find here.  Pride in preparation.  Pride in what they put on their shelves.  Pride in presentation.  Pride in their store.    So go.  Just go.

Had to add a star for two reasons:  Lechon.  This is it.  There was a tray heaping full of the stuff in all its golden and shiny glory.  I pointed and said that I HAD to have it. The first piece I tasted was the equivalent of finding $200 in an old wallet when your rent is due.  Crunchy skin that immediately melted in my mouth.  Juicy sinful fatty stuff that clung to the thick pieces of skin.  And tender meat so juicy that it made me google how this stuff was made.  Lechon is all its hyped up to be.  The other reason for the star is for the hospitality I receive whenever I go in there.  Well, I've only been twice, but each time has been great.  Once again, the family atmosphere was in full effect.  I still haven't asked who is who, but I'll work my way up to that.  But the people behind the counter have been awesome.  This time, a dude big in stature chatted about the Knicks vs. Bulls rivalry and actually made a point that I could not deny.  Seems like a great guy and he had complete confidence in his lechon, which he full well should.  But what tops it all is the way he ended our transaction.  Let's just say it was the top of the mountain for customer/vendor relationships.  When trust is built between an owner and a customer, you pretty much have a guaranteed repeat customer.  That's what the Factory has gained in me.  Also, I got the bbq ribs again...and they were even better than last time if that's even possible. And finally, I had an order of lumpia.  Now...mines were burnt on the ends.  It wasn't ideal to have to chop the ends off of each one, but the taste of them nulls the fact that I had to do that.  These were awesome tasting lumpia.  Maybe they just took their eyes off of them for a minute too long or something.  I'll definitely give these another go. I can see 5 stars in their future if the food maintains its deliciousness, which I am confident it will.

This'll prob be my last update.   They have earned 5 stars for consistently having delicious food and for the great feeling I get when I go in.   I'm horrible with names, but the guy that owns the place served me this evening and he remembered me instantly.  Again we he had a great conversation about the NBA, this time the 'Super Friends' of Miami.  And again, trust between customer and business owner was built on, which carried over from my last visit.   Good people plus good food equals 5 stars in my book.   They now have a buffet every Sunday from 9-3 I think, or 8-3.  I'm looking forward to partaking of that...wonder how they fit all the people in there, though?  Anyway, my food tonight was again a great experience for my tastebuds.  Yes, the food is a bit greasy...but like a previous reviewer (and all the Filipino folks I know) said, this cuisine is typically greasy at buffets so the meats won't dry out.  Just put everything over some rice and you're good to go...but I still just scarf down the stuff right out of the container. I just can't stress enough how nice the people here are!

So...another Filipino restaurant casualty.  I saw they had closed some time earlier this year.  Very sad, as with Karey's Kitchen, the people were very cool.

I was referred here by a friend and it was a great suggestion.    The entire office is friendly, patient, and well-informed.   Dr. Gailey educated me on many things and answered all my questions patiently and thoroughly.    I didn't get any extractions done but the hygenist got me for a deep cleaning on one side of my mouth.  She was great.  Gentle, patient and she knows her job.  There was minimal pain; she used some type of rub-on anesthetic that did ok.  10,000,000 times better than any needles.  They brought me back for a check-up and was just as informative.  They seem flexible with insurances and the prices were really good.    I have absolutely no complaints or problems with anything here.  Awesome office and dentist!

I've been here 3 times now, and each time, I fall in love with this place a little more.  Today I had a slice of the bbq chicken pizza for the first time.  Wow.  I've had bbq chicken pizza one other time, many moons ago, and the taste almost sent me to the bathroom.  But this?  This right here?  Oh my.  Sweet and savory and spicy all at once.  And of course I love their crust with the bit of garlic at the end.  It really made my day.   I also had the Napoli for the second time.  I think this might be my favorite...wait no, the Casablanca is my favorite...no, the bbq chicken...DOH! Seriously, I've never had this type of pizza, meaning thin crust gourmet.  I'm used to the big, pan crust pizza pies.  This is a treat, though it will not replace my love for pies.  It will be a new love affair. Last thing, I'm continually impressed with the freshness of their ingredients.  I've never had tomatos so sweet or mushrooms that I would eat by themselves.  Awesome stuff.

This and Gingeroot are the only places left close to me.  I pick this one when I want something packed up quick to go.  They have the pick-a-dish style setup and I like asking what I'm pointing at.  Some of the staff are more friendly than others, but they are all decent.   I've been here probably 5 times or so.  I've never gotten anything unappetizing.  I have little experience with Filipino food...that is to say I've never had a meal in someone's house by some old grandmother, so I don't know good pancit from bad pancit...good adobo from bad adobo.  But honestly, everything I've gotten from here on any visit has ranged from pretty good to delicious.   Compared to the late Karey's Kitchen (tear), Halo-Halo, also late Eggroll Lumpia Factory (tear), and Gingerroot...this food is just as good as any them.  At each place I've had at least one dish to completely wow me...and I've had about three here, and I'm sorry I don't remember the names!  I SHALL learn my Filipino cuisine, by darnit. The prices are decent, too I guess.  I mean you can get a 2 item combo over rice for like $8.  And the amount they give you is enough. One thing that blows me away every time is this fried pork..uhm...skin I guess???  Its in the tall case sitting on the counter, all fried and golden and evil.  This stuff probably takes months off of your life, but its just pure bad goodness.  And the sauce that comes with it could be put on a hubcap and taste good. I also enjoy their lumpia.  I've had it my last two visits and each time they were very light, fried perfectly, and stuffed generously.  And the taste is awesome!  Worth a whole star from this guy. The interior has a side for karaoke, which one day I will go and just sit and watch...  There's a decent amount of tables and its one of the bigger Filipino places inside.  Filipino grocery type stuff is along the walls and makes you want to try...something or another just to see what it tastes like.  A lot of deserts and snacks.  Very cool to read the packages while you wait. I now understand about the greasiness due to frequenting places like this lately.  Sometimes I do frown at how much of my food ends up being grease, but this is mainly noticeable when you have left overs the next day...warming it up is a grease-fest.  It seems a little greasier here than the other places I've visited.  But I must say, the food still taste great to me. Oh and get the cantaloupe juice!  Theirs is not as good as Halo-Halo's, but it's still one of the best things to drink on a hot day around here.

Da chicken. Merciful heavens. I can't think of one thing I would have changed about the chicken I got from here.  The crust was crunchy,  crumbly, and tasted like golden nuggets (perfectly seasoned...and I mean PERFECTLY)...and this is AFTER a 30 minute drive home.  The meat was tender and juicy - even the breast.  And most of all, the flavor went through the whole piece of chicken, not just skin deep. Everyone has their definition of what good fried chicken is.  This place has defined mine.  Haven't had better chicken at any restaurant or even at anybody's table other than my grandmother's.  They got everything about it right. I forgot that I had two sides - cabbage and rice with gravy. The cabbage was decent, but I actually prefer Cracker Barrel's as it has more flavor.  The texture of Mrs White's was better and it was chopped up in more presentable pieces.  But was lacking any wow.  Still good, don't get me wrong.  My grandmother's cabbage has spoiled me; it's hard to satisfy me with this dish. The rice and gravy was a bit disappointing.  It was bland gravy over white rice.  I was hoping the gravy would be thick and creamy but it was instead quite thin.  Not seasoned very much...  I wonder if this is the same gravy they use to smother stuff in?  I hope not. For dessert I got the banana pudding.  I have a cousin who I think makes the best BP in existence.  But, there's always someone better.  Mrs. White's almost ALMOST beat out my cousin's, but not quite.  I don't know how I can say that, seeing as how the whole little bowl was gone in 3 minutes:)  I guess that is a testament to my cuz's BP, because this stuff was awesome.  Only complaint was that some of the bananas were too ripe, although some people like it that way? That's all for my meal.   I didn't even look at the receipt, hmmm...no clue how much it all cost me haha.  I didn't care.  I've been hearing about this place since I moved to AZ and actually swerved from the far right lane on Jefferson into the parking lot, taking out several vehicles in doing so (j/k).   The place itself as others have said is pretty dumpy.  The best food is found in places of this status but as I was looking around I felt myself wishing that this specific place would get a face lift.  I don't know, its just that they are such a staple and well-known place...they could at least frame some of the memorabilia they have on the wall.  Not dirty though, mind you.  The girl there was diligently mopping.  Too much clutter by the register...personal items of the staff just laying around.  C'mon now.  Represent what you serve, instead of allowing people to think that what they will get served may represent the look of the place.  A rinky dink liquor store that serves the best corned beef - they can look like a disaster, that's just fine.  But these guys are a soul food force in the area and I feel they could be even more with an update to their building. The folks that were working there were just fine to me.  An older man greeted the customers, gave instruction to the servers, and took my order.  He knew the regulars and greeted them enthusiastically.  I liked that.  Furthermore, some guy came in needing change.  The man (hmmm I guess that's probably Mr White???) gave him tips on where to park for cheap, gave him the money to park somewhere, and told him to hurry so he won't be late for his appointment.  :) :) :)  Also shared a few observations about a woman on tv (Let's Make A Deal).   No one was rude.  You read what the golden rule is and you'll see its enforced here.  Do unto others... I saw a plate come out to a dine-in customer that was piled, and I mean PILED with fried chicken smothered in gravy and with greens and something else on the side.  It looked ridiculously amazing.  I will go back.  I will try the porkchops, smothered this and that, and of course the catfish.  I'll also try some other sides, maybe the two I chose were their ho-hums anyway. I recommend trying their chicken at least once! Oh and i saw someone on here mention their to-go order was skimpy...sorry bud but mines was 3 huge pieces that didn't even allow the box to close:)

Went back today and took out another 10 vehicles as I rammed into the left lane to make the turn into the lot... I meant to try pork chops, or catfish...nope, I couldn't get past the chicken. Once again, this chicken did not disappoint.  I had an annoying end to this long work day when I got home with this chicken.  But as soon as I picked up the drumstick and took a bite, it ALL washed away...seriously. Let's back up.   When I opened my styrofoam container, I noticed that the chicken had gotten slightly moist from the being closed up for almost an hour after I got it.  I thought the experience was going to be lessened.  No.   The drumstick was a bit soggy on the bottom from sitting so long, but like I said, I bit into it and all the annoyances of life went elsewhere and bothered some other guy. Perfection. Even when soggy. Even when sitting for over an hour. If fried chicken remains absolutely delicious even after all that, you know you've got some special stuff. What gets me is that I saw some young folks in the kitchen, I don't know if either of them fried the chicken, but if so - someone has been teaching them the real deal.  This tastes like some old woman who has been through years of hurt and pain but also joy and love has cooked this.  Someone who KNEW what bad chicken was and KNEW how to avoid that at all costs.  Someone who cared what their food tastes like.  And if youngens' are producing this kind of fare, that deserves proper kudos. I notice there is not a 'professional' atmosphere here.  Like another reviewer said, anything seems to go.   Honestly?  So what. The food is too friggin good.  Yes, we are entitled to good customer service as customers.  But like I said before, you get what you put in with the people here.  You come in with an attitude, that is what you get. I know some people put a high high value on customer service and how staff presents themselves; I do, too.  But chicken THIS good, and I mean specifically THIS chicken that is THIS good...I can accept the very casual atmosphere here. Yes, I wish they would put a bit more pride in their professionalism.   But I promise you, this chicken will make lovers of fried chicken not give a flying flea's fanny about anything else.  In each experience I've had with it, the chicken is THAT good.

Wait, what?  Winter is over?  I....didn't even know it had come.  Winters in Michigan are spawned by the devil himself.  They are demonic devices used to torture people on the east side of the country, for whatever reason.    Why would such a thing as frozen car door handles even exist?  Who does that to people?  The devil, that's who.  Where does 'Black Ice' come from?  That's not even a normal type of ice.  Only the devil can conjure up something like that.  And what about freezing windshields?  Huh?  Who freezes the windshield...INSIDE OF THE FREAKIN' CAR?!?!?!    THE DEVIL, THAT'S WHO!!!!  Seriously, the winters here make the blistering summers an afterthought.  This is as close to paradise as is possible on Earth.  I couldn't believe that I was able to give away my winter coat for good.    Hoodies as coats.  No need for Lugz boots.  Thermal underwear shouldn't even be sold here.

Ever since the job moved downtown, I've been excited for lunch.  Sooooo many places to try.  Recently, I've had equal excitement over breakfast. This is mainly due to finding this place.  I've tried the Low Carb Omelete w/chorizo, and their special - turkey, tomato, basil, egg whites and some kind of cheese on focaccia.    I was not expecting to be satisfied whatsoever with the omelet, only getting it cause I was trying to be "good".  The thing was awesome.  Hmm, I can't remember EVERYTHING that was on it, but just remember that the chorizo went together really nicely with the fluffy omelet, and whatever else was on it made it a perfect tasting deal.  The fluffiness of it was my favorite part.  Really well made.  Enough to make me declare that at least a twice a week breakfast for me going forward.  My next visit I had that sandwich, which isn't on the menu but found on their board outside.  Now this..this right here....oh man.  Maybe because I never had focaccia before.  Maybe because I'm really easy to please when it comes to sandwiches.  Or maybe because it was just friggin delicious.  The basil and garlic together with whatever cheese on there and those fresh tomatos...that right there is enough to make me love it.  But then the fluffy egg and the thin slices of turkey give it a...solidness.  I dunno, it just all comes together and the flavor is just stupid good.    Now the first time I went in, I saw a big vat of bacon.  Next to that was a big vat of potatoes.  I ordered a side of potatoes with my lo-carb omelet (yeah there went the whole lo-carb thing) and the lady noted my admiration of the bacon and threw in a slice:)  That alone made me wanna come back for the 2nd visit.  Then after tasting the potatoes, it made me know this would be a regular place for breakfast.  Right across from Starbucks so I can call my order in and get coffee while I'm waiting.  Perfect.  Plus the people are friendly here.  I also like that they don't turn on all the lights early in the morning, making it a nice place for someone like me to eat breakfast in - I'm NOT a morning person and don't like bright lights and bright people at 6am.  The prices are fine with me.  I had to give up being cheap ever since the job moved downtown.  If you can get full for under $7, I consider that great.  And here you can.  I think both times I paid about that much.    I see a lot of the bad reviews are for lunch items.  I'll have to see what the deal is on that end of things.  But if you're hungry at 6:30 and like flavorful food, I'd suggest this place.  So far they are pretty darn awesome.

I guess I am a Lucky Boy.  I was about to go to Lenny's on Central, but I was redirected by wise coworkers to Lucky Boy's.   Its a joint, which is usually a good thing.  Mental note: don't try to come out the same way you came in!  You'll know what I mean when you get an angry driver staring at you as you try to exit the wrong way.  There is a surpising amount of dining area inside this little place.  Its even got a drive-thru.   Menu is simple with burgers and dogs, and all the usual fried sides like poppers, mushrooms, onion rings, etc. Prices are great for cheap-o's or people on a budget; my meal was only $10 because I added a lemonade and an order of mushrooms.  Still, 10 bucks ain't that bad for what I got. The burger?  Yes.  Indeed.  I got the Lucky Boy, or whatever its called, with grilled onions and cheese.  The bun was toasted, the lettuce shredded, with a big ol' tomater in the middle.  Perfect joint burger.  Not this biggest patty, but very tasty.  I will have this again.  I guess I'd compare it to an In'N'Out burger.  Going up against that, Lucky's isn't quite as good...but its not quite as expensive, either.  But I ain't missing In'N'Out with Lucky's down the street.   The shrooms were fried perfect, were fresh and rank second only to the fried shrooms at Sunrise Cafe in Maricopa, AZ.  And not being a french fry kinda guy, I must say that these fries were delicious - seasoned just so.  Ranks 3rd all-time behind Rally's fries and Red Robin's fries. The lemonade was suggested to me, and I'm glad I got it.  Not THE best, but really good. Service was quick and accurate. No complaints there. No reason not to give 4 good stars.  I'll go back a few more times and update to see if they can reach 5. Oh, and the ranch they use is the best ranch i've ever gotten anywhere.

4 stars maintained.  Each time I've been here, the burger has always been juicy and fresh...never an over/undercooked or old patty. I mentioned before about comparing this to an In and Out burger...I was wrong to do that.  This is a greasy, ghetto, round' the corner burger that doesn't try to win any appearance or neatness awards...it just tastes great.  And the quality of the meat is top-notch.  Service continues to be swift and friendly.

We go here at least once a week and we're not even leaguers.   The specials CANNOT BE BEAT!  Mondays and Tuesdays are specials days (that's a lot of 's's on the ends of words)...Monday after 9 is $1 shoes and games.  If you already got shoes, you're sweetness on a stick these days.  The regular price...meh.  I'm cheap.  its about 8 bucks total for shoes and a game.  The place is clean, which is something I'm not used to in a bowling alley.  Back in Michigan, we had a place called Liberty Bowl.  It was dirty.  That was my first bowling experience so that's what I expect all places to be.  So I was pleasantly surprised by Kyrene Lanes.  Nice and bright and SMOKE FREE!!!  Yeah!  Its an awesome place for kids because of the smoke free atmosphere.  But I don't think they have balls that are lighter than 6 pounds, and if they do they're hidden somewhere.   The lanes seem well maintained.  There are the inevitable lane malfunctions, though.  But they are taken care of with no scruff.  They've got bumper bowling...its not the push a button kind, its the 'go tell the guy at the counter to put the bumpers up' kind...which is kind of an inconvenience to have to go ALL the way to the counter if you're in lane like 88 or something. The score keepers work right...its easy to put your names in.  They don't have the really nice flat screen ones where you can watch videos...but hey, this ain't Scottsdale. After whatever o'clock, they turn off the lights and turn on the neon and music.  There are screens throughout the place that come down and display videos to some of the songs.  It can be a bit distracting if you're not used to it...but most people who are bowling at that time of night are just there for fun anyway.  The leagues are from 5:30 to 9:30.  This sucks for me because I am cheap and have to go after 9:30 to get the $1 specials...and I live out in Maricopa.  So the ride, the games, and the ride back usually takes me til like 11:30.  I gotta get up early in the morning around....hey wait, no one cares.  Food?  They got it.  And its tasty.  But its EXPENSIVE.  As are most bowling alleys, I guess.  You need about $10 to eat here...that's just for yourself.  If you got little ones...man. The bathrooms are not pretty, though.  If they kept them as clean as the rest of the place, I'd give this place 5 stars.  (That's just me)  There is a pro shop right inside here.  The guy that was in there was SUPER helpful and patient.  I know nothing about bowling other than 'throw the ball to hit the pins', and he explained what kind of shoe and ball I should get and why.  All this while helping other customers.  The customer service here is great period.  Always friendly and helpful.    The atmosphere is a little laid back, not what i'm used to.  Its nice here.  Bring the family...bring grandma!  The house balls and shoes...well, what do you expect.  If you really care that much about these two things, you should really get your own gear.  You save a lot in the long run by not having to pay for shoes.  And having your own balls is...wow, did I just write that?  Ok, so yeah.  Dirty bathrooms, and run of the mill house equipment, but great service, no smoking, good deals, and nice lanes get this place 4 stars for me.

Specials have always been running...I just got someone who didn't know what they were talking about at the time I said they didn't have them anymore.  Star re-given. Also, service was awesome on a recent visit!

I was born and raised in Chicago, and there were gyros on almost any joint's menu.  I'm surprised McDonalds there didn't start serving them.  I believe that I know a good gyro when I taste one, as I've had them anywhere from a genuine greek vendor downtown to a little shack dive on the south side.   That said, Gyro Express' gyro pita is right up there.  I've had it three times.  Each time, I've eaten it slowly savoring the on point taste and the tenderness of the meat.  The pita itself is tasty, and that is a point that a lot of people don't really care about.  The sandwich comes wrapped up nice and neat in two foil wrappers so its nice and easy to eat on the go. Now I've just gone there yesterday and I ordered my usual gyro, but noticed that they had an item from my childhood...a PIZZA PUFF!  I must explain: there was a greasy spoon down the block from my house back in Chicago, and everytime I went somewhere with my mother, I'd beg for a pizza puff from this place.  A pizza puff is just a fried rectange of dough with pizza filling inside of it.  Simple, but so good.  I couldn't believe that it was on their menu, as I haven't met anyone since I moved away from Chi-town who even knew what it was. I ordered one.  I got it and it smelled like when I was a kid.  I cut it open and it looked when I was a kid.  I tasted it, and I WAS a kid again.  It was perfect.   Maybe this place is so awesome because it takes me back to better times, but the food is great.  I can only recommend the gyro and the pizza puff, though, cause' that's all I've had so far.   The staff is nice, food is served quickly, and the prices are right.

I've been back here countless times and have yet to be disappointed.  The service has always been friendly.  In fact, today I got a free baclava just because they were really busy and my order so long - the cashier said "For being so patient"! I appreciate stuff like that. But the wait is worth it to me.  Their gyro is the best I've had in Arizona and the pizza puff takes me back to my Chicago childhood.  Always delicious, too. After over 3 years of going here, it remains a 5 star place for me.  That's saying something.

Thai cuisene is another thing that I'm no expert on.  But I do know what I like - Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.  This place has both and I ordered the Pad See Ew because I have sentimental ties to that dish. Thai Basil is another one of the many restaurants taking my money in this busy little downtownish area my job is in.  I was in the mood for something Asian and this came up in mapquest.   One thing that I like about any place is if they have their up to date menu on the web.  Even the most humble website can make things better for any restaurant.  And they have one.  (and since I just found out that this is a popular chain, they'd BETTER have one) Looking over their menu, I saw typical downtown prices ($7-$9) and a LOT of variety.    They've got curry, rice, noodle, and stir-fry dishes.  Appetizers are not many, but what they offer seems to be some quality stuff - the Fried Tofu definitely has me interested. As for my dish, Pad See Ew, it was prepared to my liking (no carrots or cabbage).  See, I had a buddy back in Michigan who would make Pad See Ew for me at his old restaurant...nothing will ever come close to it.  However, this was not a bad go.  All the ingredients were there - egg, broccolli, the egg noodles, and beef.  All of it was notably fresh; no limp broccolli, tasteless onions, or questionable beef.  In fact, the beef was really tender and tasty on its own. I do have 2 gripes about the dish.  The sauce is not the best and the onions were a little undercooked.  With the sauce, there was a slight before and aftertaste that didn't sit right.  And as for the onions, they weren't undercooked to the point where they tasted raw...just not as done as I like. But the dish was overall pretty darn good.  I'd order it again. The place itself is in the little plaza type thing that's on over here.  Its next to Starbucks so its a pretty busy spot.  I went during lunch peak time so there were no tables available (only like 8 in the first place), but there are a few nice places to sit outside in front of and around the place.   Nice ambience with all the chit-chat and people coming and going. Service?  Well there was a hello and goodbye.  They were quite busy, so there was no time for weather chat.  I must point out that every single employee acknowledged me and said hello.  So that gets an automatic star right there. So far good food, nice joint, dedicated service, but a $40 a day type price.  Thai Basil is worth keeping a menu handy.  I will be back. (Sorry folks, I'm not from AZ so I didn't know that this is an already well documented chain.  Learn somethin' new everyday!)

Today's trip to Thai Basil made me realize that I was cursed, and now thanks to this place, the curse has been lifted.   I don't know how or why, but somewhere along the road of life, a curse got put on me - no matter how spicy I asked for my Chinese food to be, it would always end up MILD.  I mean, I would say it 3 or 4 times to the person taking my order on the phone. Then i figured maybe if I spoke to the person face to face so they can see the sincerity in my eyes - the very soul of me - that maybe they would make my dish spicy. But no, they didn't. I've done everything short of putting a gun to the person behind the counter's head.   I had just accepted the fact that I would never enjoy spicy Asian cuisine; that I would always have to go home add my own stuff to it. Well no more. Thai Basil has consistently asked me "How spicy do you want it?"  Not only that, but they proved that this is not just a rhetorical question. I've given them a specific level, and they do it. They. Do. It.   So the last dish I had was the Spicy Noodles with beef. It was great. The sauce was unique and tasty...not just a generic batch sauce. Of course there is always better to be had, but for a lunch special dish, this was quite satisfying.   I just wanted to updated this review because of Thai Basil's consistency. I've never gotten a 'bad' dish from here...maybe one disappointing dish (smaller portion than I thought it should have been).   4 star stat maintained.

(just read the other reviews AFTER I wrote mine...I guess different strokes for different folks)  There was one of these right down the street from my old job, then they just weren't' there anymore. That was a sad day. They used to have a daily special of an order of fried shrimp for $4...and you got SOOOOOO many.  The places with awesome values always go out of business...  Anyway, the two times I've been to this location I'm reviewing has left me missing the other one. Something isn't quite the same.  I've order the Chicken Curry Katsu both times, which is my favorite from Ono's. They serve the curry on the side, which most people would probably appreciate and prefer...but I liked how the curry would smother the chicken on the ride back to the job and make it all happy. But I must say, the taste hasn't changed. Its still an awesome dish - curry gravy with potatoes and carrots over these perfectly seasoned and fried chicken strips...with rice and a subtle-tasting macaroni salad. Somehow, when you 'accidentally' get some of the macaroni salad mixed into the rest of the stuff, it makes it all better??? (why the question marks? that wasn't even a question. this guy's weird)   Even though that's all I ever get, the rest of their menu looks sooo good. I mean the pictures OF the other stuff on their menu looks sooo good. There's pictures of all kinds of pork choppy type things stacked on other pork choppy type things sitting next to mahi-mahi, grilled and fried shrimp, my chicken katsu, and other deliciously photographed things. I can testify that the pork choppy things are incredibly tasty. They are where the 'Hawaiian BBQ' comes from in Ono's name. Oh and the chicken, too...which I've never had because I'm afraid of exactly what others here have complained about - undercooked rubberiness. But back to the 'ribs', the sauce is one of the best sauces I've ever had on any meat. Its sweet, light, and makes you want to eat the bones.  They also have Hawaiian beverages. I can't remember the name of the one I get, but it tastes like pear juice only a million times better.   Overall, the value here is acceptable. My katsu will sometimes not be finished in one sitting, and its only like $7-8 or something...which I have come to accept as well, acceptable. I had to stop being a cheap-butt when I moved out here.   I do miss the daily specials that the other location had. The shrimp are now $5 by themselves and you get like 6, as opposed to like 26 for less money. Oh well.   The service is good here. I was asked about my holiday shopping on my last visit, and I appreciated the small talk. Wait times are ok...a bit long if you're in a hurry. The inside of this location is really nice, with a lounge area, plenty of seating, and a nice view of people going in and out of the Harkins next door.   The food, service, and value here are on point, and I cannot think of any reason not to give this place 4 stars. And if they start offering specials again, then they'll get another star.

I'll get straight to the point.  Romy's Ribs has the best pork ribs I have ever put in my mouth.    The seasoning.  Let's just say I was licking my fingers even AFTER I washed them.  Jerome (the owner) expressed that people constantly ask for his recipe.  He should guard it with his life.  Its the kind of blend that makes sauce unnecessary.  Romy is from St. Louis, so this is a St. Louis style rub, and hopefully that gives you an idea of what to expect.  Kind of spicy, very savory, and just perfect.  The texture.  Tender as ribs get.  The 'skin' was the perfect consistency.  The way he cooks them, there was a crust which is formed from the rub, and seems slightly carmelized, but not really.  When you bite into it, it's the right combo of meaty and juicy.  There is no chewiness to this.  I cannot express how much I sincerely mean that these ribs produce 'perfect' bites.    The essence.  The wood that they use is the perfect one to compliment his rub.  There is a nice smoke-ring, and the smoke and rub permeates the whole rib.  As I stated before, sauce is not needed because there is a fullness that you get that makes the rib a complete experience.  Sauce almost would lessen the rib.  I don't know if Romy makes the sauce he gives out, but it is good regardless.  Sweet, but savory.  Not too spicy.  I also want to point out the feeling I got when I walked up to the place.  From the way Jerome and the cook said "hello", you knew you were dealing with down to earth, good people.  Genuine.  He lets you taste a piece before you buy anything.  He asks your name, not to call out your order, but because he wants to know the names of his customers.  You could sit down and play Spades with these guys, and the time would fly by.  This has everything to do with the food, because that same goodness comes through in the food.   I cannot stop talking about Romy's and I cannot get the taste out of my mind.  Never before have I craved something like this before, immediately after I just had it.  He is only open on Saturdays, from 12 - 5, so you have to wait a whole week before you can get some more.  And you WILL want some more.    I have not exaggerated one single thing I have stated here.  I stand by this man's pork ribs as if I made them myself.  And I will be back again next Saturday to try the next thing on the menu.  He has chicken, pulled pork sandwiches, baby-backs, beef and pork ribs, hot links, and sides.  I paid about 12 bucks for a 1/2 slab, but that is a lot of food.  If you think its pricey, just try the snack order for like 4 dollars.  The man could charge $20 for his ribs, and I'd still pay it.  They are that good.  I decided to go back and edit this review to include that the place is a little off in the cut, and its simply a trailer with 2 pits on the back.  And they only take cash.  Another update 2/29/09: Since first writing about Romy's, I have been there more times than I count on both hands.  The main thing that stands out over a course of time about a place, is if the quality is consistent.  The answer for Romy's is YES.  I have not once had a disappointing order of pork ribs.  Not once have they been over/undercooked, cold, under/over seasoned...  Also, I have fallen in love with the pulled pork sandwich.  I would marry it if it were legal...and if I weren't afraid that I'd eat my new wife.  The pork is tender, needless to say.  It also has the right amount of 'skin' and fat.  Just like the ribs, you need NO SAUCE.  The chicken?  I've only had it once.  However, I will say that it was seasoned all the way through to the bone, and it was cooked perfectly.  You know how sometimes bbq'd chicken can have doneness issues?  Well the batch I had was cooked thoroughly.  Tender, not chewy, and the perfect smoked taste.  I must reiterate that I have not had a bad meal at Romy's.  The only thing that I might drop a little lower on my list of awesomeness are the rib tips...but only cause' I'm not a rib tip kind of guy.  They are indeed meaty and just as tasty as the ribs they come off of.  So you won't be disappointed.  Romy himself is a man that I like talking to.  He always has something nice to say, a great smile waiting for you, and good conversation.  Him and Cory are good people.  So yeah, venture all the way out to Maricopa on a Saturday afternoon and visit Romy's.  You won't regret it.

Like the other guy said, they are now open Thurs - Sat....more oppurtunity to have greatness.  His cook is gone and Romy mans the grill himself.  No change in quality.   More people seem to be getting on the bandwagon, and its just a matter of time before Romy get himself a building and really starts making a killing.  I need a pulled pork sandwich....RIGHT NOW.

Sadly, Romy has decided to call it quits.  He's sold his trailer and is no longer making his awesome BBQ.   Frowns don't do justice here. A terrible loss...

Heh, didn't know reviewing a library would be so hard...I've been sitting here thinking of how to go about it for about 15 minutes.  Anyway... Books!  Yeah they got'em.  The ones you want.  And they will GET the ones you need.  That's right, the Chandler Library system has awesome tools on their website that allow you to borrow from other branches, AND other libraries throughout the country.   But...that really doesn't have anything to do with this SPECIFIC branch.  I rate it so high because of the customer service.  The help desk is just that...HELP.   I try to do research and have the author and the name of the book all ready for them to just search it on their database...well, sometimes I forget my handy little lists at home and then I'm screwed.  But the people at this branch have you covered.  They are patient, friendly, knowledgeable, and they are easy to find lingering around the aisles or behind the desk. Once you've got your items, you'll be greeted by the people at the check-out desk.  Once again, these folks are friendly, conversational, helpful, and some of them are just plain funny.   The whole staff makes this place a pleasure to visit. Now, as far as the facility itself...  Clean, efficient, organized, bright, and well kept.  There isn't much of a 'chill-spot' vibe here, though.  Its basically a computer area (plentiful), the books, and a decent sized study area.  No cafe or comfy couches and stuff.  Go to the main branch for that.  Haven't had to use the bathroom there yet...(yes, that is important to some people). I cannot complain about them not having specific books when I want them, due to the internet system they have.  However, this branch doesn't have as big of a selection as the main Chandler branch.   This review is being written specifically to point out the outstanding staff they have, so sorry if I'm a little light on the nitty-gritty.

I've only been here once, but that will change. Right down the street from me and plenty cheap!  Their lunch specials are $4.99, which is the cheapest I've seen anywhere. I had the Triple Delight.  Immediately upon opening my container, I knew I liked this place. HUGE shrimp and strips of meat...THROUGHOUT!  They do not skimp at all.  The taste was great and everything was fresh.  The veggies were cooked just right and all the meats were tender. This wasn't a combo, so I didn't get to taste their egg-rolls or fried rice.  I'm not a big fan of either, so no big deal. The service was polite, and the wait time was about 10 minutes.   Dining in is an option, and if you do, you won't be wowed by the interior.  Its just some chairs and tables setup along the wall...white tile on the floor, and white walls.  Decor isn't their main concern.  But who cares? Bottom line is you get a lot of high quality food for a great price (my order was $9.25 for a house specialty).  This is now my neighborhood Chinese food place.

I can hardly write my review because I keep getting sticky hands from this adobo.    The only experience I have with Filipino food was adobo from a fair I went to.  I used to have Filipino coworkers who would always TALK about the food, but when potluck time came around, nothing.  Anyway, the place is small and not much space to move around.  The food is in trays and you pick what you want.    I got the 2 picks and knew I wanted adobo, but asked the guy what else is good.  He gave me pancit which looked like lo mein or something.  Then he asked me if I wanted cantaloupe juice.  It took me by surprise when he pointed to this huge vat of orange, icy, slushiness...I stuttered and said "YEAH!!!" I was about to check out when I saw somebody (I guess one of the owners or family or somethin') putting something in a bowl.  I asked what it was and the heck if I can spell what they said, but it turns out it was some kind of tripe in a white gravy with rice.  Then another guy came and got something that looked awesome as well, which was pork snout.  They gave me a sample of the snout and yeah, the relationship was instant.  Pig nose and me are now friends.  So I have here in front of me is pancit, chicken adobo, pork snout and cantaloupe juice.  I haven't had such a great meal in a while.  All this stuff tastes just as good as I imagined it would when my coworkers would torture me with mouth-watering descriptions of the stuff.  The cantaloupe juicy is unbelievable...I mean the juice of something as delectable as cantaloupe has no choice but to be heavenly, and it is.  I cannot see myself going without it for more than a week.  The adobo is tender and juicy.  The pancit is not dry like I thought it would be, and has a great taste.  The pork snout is just amazing...its got a tang to it that I can't really describe, but also can't get enough of.  I can't remember what it all cost me, I didn't care after I sampled the snout.  But I got a lot of change back from a $20, so...unless it was all 1's then its not expensive.  The people inside were all Filipino and friendly enough to a newcomer.  I've always wanted to connect with my other nationality, and good food is always a great way to do so.  I know I'll be back whenever I can.  And from what I can understand the other side of the place is some kind of entertainment area, and I think one of the other reviewers said its a karaoke thing.  Cool.  Don't be afraid of Filipino food, folks.  Its hard to compare it to other cuisines, especially because I'm not well traveled in the culinary world.  But I would immediately recommend it, even to the guy who only trusts hot dogs and fried chicken.

Unfortunately, I have not had a lot of experience with Mexican food.  I'm not even sure if I've had a REAL taco yet.  But living in Arizona now, I know that good days are coming for me and my Mexican food endeavors.    My first experience was a good one at some place that I can't remember the name of...  Then I had a so-so outing at a popular Mexican chain, but I don't remember the name of that one, either.  Now we come to Mondo's.  Yes!  The place used to be a pizza joint, and there were still red and white checkers all over the place.  A little TLC could get this joint looking nice, and if I had the know-how, I'd definitely offer to do it myself...in return for free tacos. Service was great from the start.  Friendly people each time I go in there.  They put you at ease and you feel that this is a neighborhood joint you'll be frequenting - if the food is good. And it is.  First time, I had a couple carne asada tacos and a chimichanga.  The tacos were crispy, fresh and simple.  There wasn't a whole lot going on with them, just simple tacos.  Very tasty.  About $1.50 a piece. The chimichanga is just your burrito of choice fried crispy on the outside.  I can't remember what kind I chose, but it was friggin' awesome.  Perfectly fried, nice and fat, and the ingredients used were fresh and full of flavor.   I didn't need any kind of salsa for the tacos or the chimi.  They were too good for me to stop and bother with sauce.  There is a little salsa bar there with the green stuff and the red stuff.  Each time I've been there, that's all there ever was.  I suppose that's all you really need. Anyway, I have been hooked on their chimis, so I've never tried anything different.  I know its not a good idea to write a review on a place's food until you've tried a few different dishes, but I just wanted to get the word out about Mondo's.  Mainly because the people are so nice.  You get this humble type vibe when you go in, and you really want these guys to succeed.  Great and friendly service.  Tasty tacos and chimichangas.  Easy on the wallet prices.  Yup, Mondo's is that neighborhood joint I've been looking for in Maricopa.  Other places have tasty food, but the prices are a bit high.  You can easily eat here for 6 bucks. Oh and they have Horchata!  It is the SECOND most refreshing drink I've ever had.  Reminds me of a Vietnamese drink I had once which is also a rice/coconut/milk type thing (and the #1 drink of all time). If you're ever in the area, or if you live here and want some good tacos for cheap, I recommend Mondo's. Once I try some other dishes, this place probably gets 5-star treatment...

I've been to Mando's about four more times since my review...not much has changed as far as the quality of their food goes.  The horchata continues to be great.  So are the crispy little tacos.  I haven't ventured too far out of the box, pretty much sticking with tacos, burritos, and chimis.  Its just something about the heftines of the chimi that you can't help but smile about.  Service continues to be friendly.  Only thing I'd like to see is an update for the interior, but money is tight, I'm sure.

I've been here twice; once for breakfast and once for dinner.    Breakfast was a looong time ago, so all I can remember is that it tasted great but the price was a bit much.  (I'm cheap)  I just had dinner tonight...well if you can call an appetizer combo 'dinner'.  It was pick any 4 items, and I chose fried cheese sticks, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini and fried chicken tenders.  Yup, a big ol' deep fried celebration on a plate.  Everything was fried to absolute perfection!  Nothing was greasy.  Nothing was over cooked.  Nothing was soggy.  I mean, total golden crunchiness in every bite.  The zucchini's taste came through the batter.  The mozzarella gooied out of the perfectly battered and seasoned crust.  The mushrooms had a distinct sweetness to the batter, which was pleasant and delicious.  And the chicken tenders were juicy and had a nicely seasoned batter.  It was all delectable.  Now, the service is what really won me over.  I was dead tired.  I didn't feel like eating at home.  I really didn't feel like being bothered by anybody or anything.  My waitress was very nice and pleasant.  She took the edge off of my mood and I relaxed and was at peace finally that night.  A genuine smile goes a long way.  Oh and she called me 'Honey'.  I like being called 'Honey'.  The price...eh, still a bit much.  The total bill with a drink came to 14 bucks.  I should stop being cheap.  But a $4 pop is not fun for me.  The platter itself was about $10, which is the norm for appetizer give-me-alls.  I left a nice tip because of the kindness I received.  What goes around comes around.  I can't remember what time they open, but they serve breakfast so it must be early enough.  They close at 9 during the week, and not sure about the weekend.    Its pretty quaint and cozy inside.  The decor is somehow soothing and puts you at ease.  Very clean as well.  All in all, this place is worth a visit if you don't mind the prices.  But like I said I'm a cheapo.  Anyway, I've found a place to unwind and have a good meal away from the tensions at home.

This place is down the street from a place I've been staying at lately, and I only ventured in here in search of some Sprite and/or Squirt.  I had heard about how cool this place and places like it are, but I finally got a chance to see for myself.  Its a regular grocery store for the most part, focusing on Mexican goods.    What makes this place awesome is the whole side of the store that has hot food and baked goods.  The assortment of multi-colored baked yummies is awe-inspiring.  People buzz around the display case with trays that they put their chosen stuff on, and then go to the checkout.  Everyone I've seen in my few visits there have their trays overflowing with all kinds of breads and deserts.  There is a long long counter full of hot foods.  I have no clue what most of it is, but it all looks delicious.  The signs are in Spanish, but if you know Mexican food, then you'll probably know what all the stuff is.  But someone like me can only asked stupidly, "Uh, wut dat?"   Today I couldn't resist something in a tray at the end of this counter.  It looked like some kind of roasted pork, all gooey and tender and amazing looking.  I asked what it was and the guy said pork, I asked to taste it and he let me, and then I got a pound of it.  This is what I've been wanting for so long...slow roasted pig.  I've only dreamed of what that skin must taste like, and now I know.  Unbelievable.  There is also another counter island in the middle of this section that seems to have a lot of sides and deserts in it.  It all just looks so appetizing.  Its not a good idea to come in here when you're hungry.  I admit, if you're clueless about Mexican cuisine then you will be a little lost.  You won't know what to order.  You won't know what tastes good and what you won't like.  But that is part of the whole culinary adventure.  I say embrace it.  As far as being a supermarket, its ok.  The prices are the same as other places like Fry's, but not as many sales going on.  But who cares about that stuff.  The place to be is over by those display cases of goodness.

This is a nice place to have in little Maricopa.  Its the only sushi option we've got, and luckily, it does not disappoint.    Let me say right away that I have only had the rolls.  The raw stuff has eluded me, so if you're wondering about how that is, sorry...  I visit this place whenever I'm in a down mood, because the service and food here is excellent.  The prices are normal I guess for sushi places...I haven't been to any other so I don't really know.  The inside is quaint, not too frilly.  Comfortable for a meal alone or with folks.  Every roll that I have had has been above expectations.  Absolutely excellent.  I never know what to order, so I tell the guy behind the counter what I'm in the mood for and he makes several suggestions.  He has been on point each time.  Every employee there has been awesome.  The cook always smiles and waves when you come in - makes you feel very welcome.  I recommend the Maricopa roll (yup that's the name), the Dragon Roll, Killer Shrimp Roll, and the Dynamite roll.  Those are all the ones I've had so far and they are all especially tasty.  Fresh ingredients, well prepared, and great flavors.  The portion sizes are typical I suppose.  You might not get full, so you might want an appetizer.  Of these, I have only had the potstickers, which are one of the top 3 potstickers I've had.  Their menu looks plentiful, so I'm sure you could find your favorite sushi here.  If you're a Maricopan and you like Sushi, do not be afraid to go here.  Its a great place where you will feel welcome and have an awesome meal.  Zero complaints equals five stars.

I am a rookie to the coffee shop game, as I routinely have my Starbucks everyday I'm in the office (more for the friendly staff at my pref'd location than the coffee itself). However, I have visited One Coffee down the way from Cartel, and finally Cartel itself. So far I have had the dark chocolate something something and the herbal iced tea. The dark choc thing was quite smooth and I appreciated the detail the barista gives each drink, with the leaf design on top.  I've always thought that was awesome when I see it on TV or something. The herbal iced tea is something I'd like to drink everyday.  It was perfect.  All kinds of herbal flavors came together in a minty end.  Definition of refreshing. My coworkers feel they are pricey; I agreed with them but now that I think about it, I'd pay about the same at starbucks for the kinds of drinks I get.  So I have no issue with their prices. Atmosphere is laid back and open, plenty of room to chill or get some work done. Cust serv has been spot on and friendly. If there is an adverse vibe here as indicated by some reviews and even some friends/co-workers, I did not feel that.   Or perhaps I am oblivious to it. If I have the chance to sample some more serious drinks, they will probably get another star.

Only been to this location, but been about 10 times.    The food is good everytime I go, which is always during dinner time and on the weekend.  There's usually no less than 6 of us going at one time, and not once has anyone ever complained that the food was nasty.  You got your common American dinner stuff here: fried chicken, mashed potatoes, roast, fish, steaks, blah blah blah.  Its a safe place to go when you got people who are hungry but don't like a lot of fancy foods.  But you've still got a really decent amount of choices here, so you won't get bored after your first go-round.  We usually pay like $12 or so on the weekends, which includes your drink.  I think its worth it, as everything tastes good and plus there's that made-to-order steak grill.    The place is big, but there's usually a nice sized crowd here that can make bumping into people occasionally a reality.  No big deal, just watch that soup!  Yeah sure, there's a lot of kids wandering around sometimes...just don't step on them and you'll be fine.  Some people don't like this kind of atmosphere, but this is a family restaurant.    I haven't had issues with cleanliness here yet after about 10 visits.  I haven't seen flies around the deserts...nor have I been grossed out by the bathrooms.  Freshness issues with food have been pretty much nonexistent aside from your usual piece of fried chicken or whatever that was left in the tray from 2 refills ago.  You just gotta know how to spot old food...and that's at any buffet.  But not once have I gone and the food hasn't been replenished quickly.  No wait for my fried shrimps!!!  I usually suggest this place when I know we are all kinda broke but very hungry.  So that's why I'm a fan.  No 5 stars just because its such typical cuisine, I guess.  Oh, and I've also had their breakfast bar once...they had a lot of your good but common morning stuff...all very fresh and delicious.  I don't usually like breakfast bars for some reason, but I pigged out on this one.  I recommend it!  Its on Sunday morns.

Saw them on Check, Please Arizona. I got the rame that starts with a 'T' and it isn't the Tokyo one.   It was...decent.  Nothing to rave about but still a good meal; 7 out of 10. Also ordered the gyoza and they were well cooked and flavorful.  Sauce was nondescript. The service consisted of ordering at the cashier and having our food brought to us.  Both experiences were perfectly fine, and the cashier (Vanessa?) was very friendly. Two others ate with me and they both commented that their ramen was good but they've had better.  I can't remember which ones they ordered but one had a very light broth and the other an almost brown broth.   I must say it was all fresh.  The ingredients were not skimpy and the portion size was big.   A very middle-of-the-road experience. Atmosphere is very open and public with big benches and tables inside, and a small area outside to eat at. If you like ramen, I can't highly recommend this place but I would say you could do much worse.

We went during their 'soft' grand opening and just on a whim.  We had the kids with us so I thought it might be fun, but was really hoping that it wasn't lame. Nope.  Not lame. If you've never been in a candy store, you might be overwhelmed.  There is candy EVERYWHERE.  Rows and aisles of candy and more candy.  Chocolates, hard candy, weird candy, old school candy. And of course the huge Pez section and the Wall of Friggin' Jelly Beans. We spent much longer in here then I thought we could've on just picking out candy.  I had no intention of going up and down EVERY aisle, but ended up doing so just to see "ooh what's this?!"   Kids go nuts here.  Who can blame them.  Heck, I saw grown men with wide eyes going up and down aisles...with no kids.  It puts a smile on your face to see your old favorites, and unless you had some really obscure favorites (or are reeeeeally old) then you will find what you're looking for. As one who has always had a piece of two of candy if presented, but not one to seek out bags of candy under the influence of a sweet tooth, I didn't expect to fill my baggie up so full.  But I did.  And I only spent $15.  That's it...for all that candy...chocolates and all. There were 4 adults and 3 kids with us...we all pigged out and got stomach aches later.  With the little individual pieces so accessible, its hard not to grab at least SOMETHING and buy. The owners work here and they are a younger couple.  Super friendly.  And super excited about their business, very proud.  This is what you like to see out of owners; pride in what they have worked hard to build.  The guy couldn't stop talking, and we didn't want him to.  It was quite refreshing to see that kind of attitude, and was worth a few stars alone. They plan to continue to improve; stock more, add more shelves.  I truly wish these folks the best, and will be taking the kiddos here when they 'do good'.

I've had 2 items from this awesome food truck.  Texas Toast Blackened Catfish Sandwich That day, they didn't have anymore fried catfish.  I almost said nevermind, but I'm so glad I didn't.  The sandwich was huge, I could only handle half.  It was a while ago so I can't remember everything on it, but their cajun sauce i definitely remember.  The sauce and the blackened fish meshed so well, along with the toasty texas toast.  It was flawless.  I can only imagine how much more I might have liked the fried fish.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  Fried catfish k-tacos If someone had told me I'd wake up that morning and have a perfect meal, I'd say...'why are you talking to me this early'.  The catfish was flawless (there's that word again).  Fried like my own grandmother was in that truck doing the cooking.  I haven't had catfish seasoned and fried this well since her.  A better job could not have been done here.  Every single thing on these tacos was awesome.  And again, their white cajun tartar sauce walks hand in hand with this fish.  The best catfish I've had outside of my grandma's, and the best fish tacos I've had period.  The first time I had food from this truck was at a farmer's market.  The wait was a bit because the line was quite long.  Second time, same thing.  I'm not a frequent food truck customer, so I'm not sure what an average wait time should be.  However, I did not mind the wait because of the kind of food they were pumping out of there.  I mean, you're serving up platters of freshly fried and perfect catfish.  You can take a while.  I don't mind.  Customer service is just fine. Their website has a schedule to track them, which I really appreciate. Only wish they had clones.

Been here three times now, enough to get a feel for the place's food.  I've had the Tuscani Panini, Scottsdale Panini, sweet potato fries, and raspberry Italian soda. First visit with the Tuscani, I did not enjoy the bread...had an aftertaste.  Everything inside was fresh, and the flavors came together nicely - Honey baked ham, Genoa salami, provolone, tomato, basil pesto.  Also had the Italian soda that time, friggin delicious. Went back the second time just for another Italian soda. Today was the third visit and a Scottdale Panini - Grilled chicken, bacon, swiss, avocado, dijonnaise served on focaccia.  Perfect.  Everything about it was on point.  Fresh, well put together, nicely pressed, and all the flavors were a team. I see some people really like the customer service.  I have not experienced anything out of the ordinary. The place is small, and seating is awkward.  Unless you squeeze into a corner, you're sitting right where everyone is standing around in line. Prices are decent.  Downtown. A co-worker gets the cobb salad often and it is quite huge...not something I'd finish in one sitting.  Paninis are decent size, although i usually finish both halves. Take a look at their online menu and find something you like, or make your own salad, panini, sandwich or wrap. Recommended.

I have been here about 5 times, on Wing Tuesday.  I give five stars mainly because of the wings.  From Buffalo Wild Wings, to Hooter's, to any other wing place I've grubbed at, Native New Yorker kills them all.  They may not have as extensive list of flavors as Buffalo's, but the quality is far above.  Their wings are breaded, which is my favorite kind, and every wing that I've ever placed in my mouth from there has been juicy and perfectly cooked.  No dry bones, no undercooked drummies, no 'bottom of the bin' batches.   The asiago wings are something on a whole different level of chicken wing.  I usually order about a dozen of these, and then another dozen broken down into the other various flavors they have. The service each time I have been there was awesome.  Twice, our server waived the 'gotta buy a drink to get the discount' thing.  It usual takes a while for our orders to get ready because there is usually so many of us, but no one's food has ever been cold.  We get prompt refills, napkins, extra sauce or whatever else we request.  Friendly.   The atmosphere is great to me.  There are so many HD tvs around that you can see something of interest no matter where you're sitting.  I even requested that the channel be changed to a different game once, and they did it right away and with a smile. I love this place, and would go there even if it wasn't 'Wing Tuesday'.  It is a wing lover's paradise.

Been here four times now.  I have not been disappointed even slightly at all.  Pretty much right outside the door to our building at Cityscape.  Ignore all the construction going on above your head and you'll see it tucked in the new hotel they're building.    Nice inside, being all new and stuff.  Flat screen Samsungs (I want one) overhead at the bar area...looking like an old school diner for the modern times.  A lot of seating there as well as in the main sitting area.  The place is pretty roomy and bright.  I like it.  And you can see the kitchen staff's heads through a glass pane:)  The food. I've had: The breakfast grilled cheese BC Breakfast Burrito Lox and Bagel  All 3 were completely awesome.  The taste plus the portion size made me a happy guy.  The breakfast grilled cheese has hash browns, bacon, eggs and cheese on it, made like a regular grilled cheese sandwich.  Its big.  Stacked.  And for $5.75, its one of the best buys in the area.  The sandwich is just a combo of all the good things about breakfast for me...minus a pancake that they should try to work in there somewhere...  No frills about this thing, just good eatin'.  This is something that would satisfy one of the burly construction guys walking around, or a fru-fru business lady trying not to fall in her heels.  Next, the burrito.  Now this was ridiculous.  About two years ago I discovered that I like breakfast burritos.  If I had not discovered that back then, then I would've discovered it the day I had this burrito.  Chorizo.  Eggs.  Pepper Jack.  Lettuce.  And i ordered mines without the black beans, but PLUS PORK GREEN CHILE!!!!  This stuff.  I could eat it with nothing else.  But dumped on top of this fat burrito, I went to a higher level of eating pleasure.  I took it around to everyone around me and made them look at it.  Made them.  "Look look!" I yelled, "Look at all the heavenly delight in this container! LOOOOOK!"  The burrito would've been great just by itself, but having those big chops (sounds better than 'chunks') of tender pork in all that green gravy chile type stuff was too much.  It was a big deal to me.  Those flavors just held eachother and smiled at eachother and loved eachother and stuff.  Seriously.  I'd recommend that to anyone at any given moment.  A tad...bit...pricey though - I ended paying $14 for all of it...although a nice bowl of fruit ended up in my bag somehow so maybe that did it, and I just wasn't paying attention.  Oh well.  It was friggin worth it.  I hadn't had lox before.  Couldn't wrap my mind around fish on a bagel.  But I learned that it is absolutely delicious.  This came as a build it yourself project.  A nice platter of sliced egg, tomatos, capers, two globs of cream cheese, a bagel of your choice, and the star of the show - the smoked salmon.  Ooooh!  I had fun building this stupendous sandwich.  And there was so much of everything that I could've built a solid 3 of them.  But only one bagel so I piled it high (take note CHOMPIE'S...this is what 'piled high' is).  First bite, I knew I had been missing something wonderful all this time.  Smoked salmon.  I could've just eaten that by itself.  I've never had it anywhere else so I can't compare this place's.  But it was this fresh, smokey, non-fishy, wonderful thing.  Along with my everything bagel and the eggs and cream cheese and tomato it was just a great experience.  So flavorful.  Also a bit pricey around $11-12...but again, this is downtown.  (rolls eyes)  The service is also good.  Probably because the first time we went was when they were opening at 6, and there were only like 4 people in there.  They let us sample the wonderful fresh squeezed OJ.  But this is $4 for a small cup...delicious but not worth it.  Also, everyone has been pretty friendly which is nice early in the mornings.  When its been busy, we still didn't experience any decline in service.  I would like to sit down here and see how it goes as a dine-in'er.  Oh and about the portions - everything seems big.  The sandwich was stacked like a brickhouse, the burrito was big enough to share and still be stuffed, and the lox came with so much of everything.  I suggest splitting something so the cost won't hit you so much.  Especially a burrito.  But that sandwich is only about $6 anyway, so that is just an awesome value.  I hope that their portions stay like this, but it's probably just because they are newly opened...  Fingers crossed.

This is a 3 out of 5 day stop for me now.  I have to admit that I haven't strayed from the Breakfast Grilled Cheese sandwich for the last few weeks.  Its THAT good.  Its not really productive for review writing, though.   Lately I've modified the sandwich to sub wheat instead of white, and egg whites instead of egg normals.  Personally, its better now.  I love the taste of egg anything and the whites give a good uniform egg taste.  The size of the sandwich hasn't changed; still huge.  I couldn't finish it one sitting anymore.  So I started ordering half a sandwich which isn't on the menu, but the folks there make it for me anyway.  I have unfortunately paid like 3 different prices for it since different people take the order.  Half a sandwich should be half the price, but its usually only about $2 off.  Whatever. I'd be better off just getting the whole thing and saving the other half for lunch. The sandwich's price went up $2 since my first review...so did a LOT of other items.  I knew they would modify their menu, but I didn't think they'd go up so much on so many things.  Oh well.  Its two steps away from me and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese is probably all I'll ever buy.  So yeah they got me. Another reason other than the sandwich that they'll keep four stars is their service.  I order as soon as they open at 7am and every person is always friendly.  I've gotten offered samples of their awesome OJ or apple juice while I wait.  And there are two of the folks that recognize me now.  Service and plain ol' friendliness goes a long way with me. I'll be going here as long as their there.

Never thought I'd write a review about a Starbucks, but this one is worthy of a review. I work doing a job I don't like.  I get to work early...like before-God-wakes-up early. I'm usually not in a good mood during my first few minutes there. But every morning, a couple co-workers and I make a trip to this Starbucks.  Its like 5 minutes away walking (it used to be on Adams and we went there, too).  Its always nice coming here.  There are 3 staff members that I know by name now (Jason, Johnny, and Brittney (SP)).  These guys are great.  Friendly, talkative, easy going, and down to earth.  I've gone to some starbucks and felt like I was really doing something wrong by coming in and ordering a beverage.  This location is so not that way.  Even when they get busy - they stay at the same coolness level.  Another thing that I really love here is the way they just hook a brother up - suggesting awesome drinks that I would never have thought to put together.  I've had some crazy delicious frappes thanks to these guys.  And before them, I never knew what a Black Eye was!  A lot of times I'll just say "make me something good", and they hook it up.  Besides the early morning crew, I've also had good experiences in the afternoon when its pretty darn busy.  Don't know any of their names though.  This place is such a requirement for my work day.  I need it.  Honestly.  Its not just the caffeine (I actually get decaf anyway)...its not just the familiarity of having a warm beverage in the morning.  Its coming here and seeing familiar faces and chewing the fat about the NBA, and having that personal touch, and stuff (and the cute cashier with a great smile that i don't know her name...).    These folks are great here.  I don't know enough about what is good coffee and what is not to rate the coffee.  I mean, I drink the decaf with white chocolate and cinnamon dolce just about every morning...and I think it tastes good.  So yeah, I can't say their coffee or frappes are better or worse than anywhere else.

Food = 5 stars Layout and issues = -2 stars  I cannot say I've had one thing from here that wasn't great.  My favorite thing to get is the Green Chile Cornbread!  Sweet green chile cornbread drowned in this chunky salsa type stuff with shredded pernil.  I didn't know what pernil was before but now I cannot do without it at least twice a month.  Fuego's is so tender...so flavorful.  And on top of this cornbread, its just absurd.  I could eat this anytime, any day.  Speaking of pernil, the first thing I had here was the Pernil Torta.  Actually, a coworker let me taste a little piece and I ranted on that whole day about how good it was.  Its just that it has this specific taste that my grandmother's pork ribs had.  I thought I'd never get that taste again, and who knew it'd be at a Mexican place.  The only complaint with this sandwich is the bread...i don't like it.  It doesn't...go.  If this was on texas toast, i would be eating one right now.  I've also tried the tacos and the nachos.  Both offer a lot of food.  The tacos are on par with any good taco I've had.  The nachos are huge and got a lot of different good flavors going on.  I'd recommend either.  My second favorite thing to get here are the empanadas.  The only empanada i ever knew anything about was Taco Bell's desert ones.  These ain't that.  These have beef, cheese, peppers, stuff, more stuff and some other stuff in this perfect pocket crusty flaky thing.  And there is a sweetness to it all that makes these irresistible.  I am always torn between these or the cornbread.  The value is normal downtown stuff.  You do get a large amount of food, though...so you shouldn't feel sour after you shell out at least $10 bucks for lunch.  You'll probably have leftovers (yeah right).  The staff are always friendly, although they are really busy all the time.  I've had to stand around a lot even after waiting to come in after I call ahead.  Standing around wouldn't be so bad if the layout of the place didn't suck.  This is another booties-in-my-plate type setup, where customers have no choice but to hover around diners and their meals.  No matter where you stand, you end up dancing the cha-cha trying to get out of the servers' and other customers' way.  The drink station is right in a high-traffic area, so everybody is in everybody's way all the time.  It helps to sit outside where you can people watch.  This is a frequent place for me on the lunch list.  I can't stay away from that cornbread!
