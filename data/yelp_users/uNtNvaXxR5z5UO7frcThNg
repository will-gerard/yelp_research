Oh my good god this place is amazing. Thank GOD we had a reservation because the place was freaking packed (Friday, dinner).   The service was on point - our server even took the time to write all the specials (and their descriptions, and there are a LOT) down on a piece of paper because we were sitting right in front of them and thus couldn't really see. We didn't ask him to do that - he just took it up on himself. Totally unnecessary, but it's that extra mile, folks.   I got the Rokerij Benedict - all I can say is holy orgasm in my mouth. Forreals. Basically it's two little beef tenderloins on two english muffin halves, topped with CRAB and jalepeño hollandaise.  Probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Ever.   Their green chile potato is their signature item and I found it rather unremarkable for something that they promote so heavily. But it was fine.   Drinks were strong, atmosphere cozy, staff amazing. Loves.

I've been putting off writing this review for ages, mainly because I love it so much that I want to do it justice. You're intimidating me, Postino! You're intimidating me with your loveliness!  Just get your butt to the Monday/Tuesday happy hour special. Just do it and get it over with for the first time so henceforth you will realize that it is where you need to be on Monday and/or (yes there have been a few occasions I have gone two nights in a row DON'T JUDGE ME) Tuesday night.   You get any bottle of wine and a plate of the most decadent bruschetta, for $20. We're not talkin' a few little slices of bread with some chopped romas and basil... We're talking about full-flavored, substantially protein'd, tasty-ass bruschetta here, folks. You get to choose 4 of the 12 varieties they offer, and you get 4 slices of each. That way you and whoever you go with, can try them all. TWO PIECES OF EACH FOR ME AND TWO OF EACH FOR YOU, NO CHEATING. I'm watching you. And counting. And nomming.   Here are my favs: The prosciutto w/ figs and marscapone Smoked salmon w/ pesto Brie & apples w/ fig spread Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese  Good god I want it and I want it now.  Some of the wines I've had are excellent. Some are just ok. That happens when you frequent this place as much as I do, and their wine list is ever-changing. I have discovered some of my favorite wines here, and nothing ever that I would turn my nose up at.   I've now written so much about their food and wine that I am going to skip right over ambiance. It's awesome. End of story. And well worth the sometimes 1 hour wait.  Probably my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Probably.

Oh no oh no oh no :[ The decline of one of my favorite restaurants is upon us, which makes me very sad. This might be a bit long as I normally hold Havana Café very near and dear to my heart.   Over the last 4 years I have been to each of the three locations (north valley, Central and Chandler - which has since closed) and loved each. Consistently good food, drinks, and service. The past few times I have visited, I've started to see the signs of a decline in quality, but last night really sealed the deal.   The mojitos - These are what DRIVE me to the restaurant. I have long said that the mojitos at Havana Café are my very favorite libations that have ever crossed my lips. Always very fresh, not too sweet, lots of mint, and perfectly strong. Last night they tasted like they came from a MIX. I do have to say that they were quite strong, so that was nice as I do enjoy a bit of a buzz, but that was about the only redeeming quality. A microscopic amount of mint, syrupy taste, and why on god's green earth were they PINK?! They were never pink before!   The food - I had my usual, the Paradise Pulled Pork. It was tasty as always! They have definitely messed with the portions though. You used to get an equal amount of pork, to the rice and bean mixture. That being said, you still get a considerable amount of food. But for $20 it stung a bit to be given the shaft on my tasty shredded swine.   My honey had the Gambas y Pollo which we really enjoyed. It was quite tasty! Yummy sauce that complimented the shrimp quite well.  The service - Really pretty bad. The man who took care of us (and the only one who was there serving) was not outright rude, but I felt like we were interrupting the bookkeeping that he was doing at the table in the corner, by coming in to eat (we were not the only people there). When my man asked him whether he liked the mojito or the caipirinha better, he made sort of a big deal of saying that in the (large amount) of years he has worked there, he has never tried either as they just don't appeal to him. An odd answer for sure, but I guess honest. He gave both of us a really crappy vibe. While we were there he actually threw something at the busboy.   I have experienced this man before - and once saw him repeatedly being extremely rude to a guest on the patio over the entire course of my dinner. I don't know the whole story but it was very off-putting. That experience almost had me saying I was not going to come back to this location, but what can I say, it's always been a fav of mine.   I REALLY hope this was a fluke, as I would hate to see such a previously amazing restaurant take this bad of a nose dive.   I almost feel like I've lost a best friend.   TL;DR - Great food. Definitely overpriced especially on account of the shrinking portions. Shitty service. POOR mojitos (which previously would knock my socks off).

Yay I am here with a happy update! The past few times I have been back, they have NOTICEABLY improved both timeliness and friendliness, which brings them to a solid 4 stars in my book.   Kudos, Thai Lana, Kudos.

I'm gonna have to go against the grain a bit here - I wanted SO badly to love this place! I had only heard good things, and the theme - although a bit over the top - is fun.  I ordered some Thai Teriyaki something something local special that they had written on a little blackboard in the front. It sounded amazing.  What I unwrapped was a sauce-filled mess with 6 flakes of weird lettuce and white tomato slices. Oh and a metric fuckton of pepper. The bun ripped apart at the seam, presumably because of the enormous amount of sauce that was on the sandwich. And I'm a SAUCE girl, people. If it pours or you can dip it then I want a lot of it. But this was over the top for even me. I threw over half my sandwich away.   The staff was fine but unremarkable, no real complaint there.   The inside is kind of grimy feeling but I get that it's part of the theme. If the sandwich was amazing it'd definitely be forgivable.   Normally I'd give it a second chance, but with SO many different sub places around, I probably won't risk it again here.

What can I say? Khai Hoan has the best Pho that I have tasted in the Phoenix area.   I generally get the Pho with Rare Beef and Beef Balls. The broth is tasty and not too salty or oily, and the Beef is super tender.   Also not to miss is the spring rolls. At first sight I was a little weirded out as they looked (and felt) like *ahem* something you may find at the Le Castle Boutique, but that's just how spring rolls are (chef boyfriend says technically they are summer rolls, as spring rolls are fried). But they are TASTY. Peanut sauce, crunchy fresh veggies, fat shrimp. MMMMMMMM I want some right now.   Last, you MUST get the Vietnamese coffee! You brew it yourself in the cutest little contraption that drips right into a tiny glass of calorie-free sweetened condensed milk. It IS calorie free, right? RIGHT?! When it's done brewing you pour it over a cup of ice and it is DECADENT.   Go there. Now. And crave it every day thereafter.

Oh Vig, how I love you. Let me count the ways:  1. Bocce. I mean come on. More bar/restaurants need to have some sort of interactive feature that you can play with your friends. Despite this place always being packed, I've never had to wait that long to play. AND if I wear my red suede heels, my shoes match the red team perfectly! Aaah the small pleasantries of being female!  2. The food. I can't recall trying anything that I haven't liked. My favorite being the Hot Chick. I am a chicken sandwich fanatic and this is the best one that I have found. Ever. Slightly spicy with a generous helping of avocado. Dreamy. Oh and the curry aoli they serve with their sweet potato fries is to DIE for. Can I eat it on everything? Because I'd like to eat it on everything.   3. The drinks. I can't really say they're AMAZING, because I always have beer. I can get some of my fav standard beers, plus a few interesting cocktails if I feel like branching out. Good in my book!   4. The atmosphere/decor. Cute and attracts the beautiful crowd without feeling pretentious. The patio is lovely and they are always playing awesome music.  5. The staff. Friendly. Quick. Flawless. A+  6. I can walk there from my house. Seals the deal.   In fact I love it so much that I'm going in about...oooh 30 minutes, for happy hour :]

Great little place. There is not much seating AT ALL but it somehow adds to the charm of a little British hole in the wall place. Great beers as well!  I thought my fav was the Spicy Asiago Chicken but last time I got the Carne Adovada and it knocked my socks right off.   The pasties are pretty big too, and for $9 to have a half leftover for tomorrow (even tasty reheated, I can attest!), that is a-ok with me!   Not a lot to say other than I really like this place and am always down for a patsy. Er, pastie. Er, PASTY!

I love this place! It's really basic, but you get a really great sandwich.  All their ingredients taste really fresh. The bread is soft and doesn't have that crazy-processed flavor and texture of most sandwich shops these days. All the veggies seemed ripe and fresh and made me feel like I was eating something really good for me.   My fav is the Symphony - I love me some sprouts on a sammich.   The staff has always been friendly and quick, nothing to complain about there, and you even get a little cookie with every order!   I think the only room for improvement I saw was in the bathrooms. It was right after a lunch rush but they were pretty grody.

I'm going to have to update my review to 5 stars. I've been back here many (many. MANY.) times since my last review - so many that I don't always check in for fear my friends will see just how obsessed I am with this place - and everything has been above and beyond delicious.  The sandwiches are amazing. Try the specials. No really. They know what they are doing. This is coming from a creature of habit who usually finds one thing she likes and orders it over and over again!

Meh. I've tried True Food Kitchen twice now and both times have been quite underwhelming. Not anything terrible, just bland, and boring. I had the panang curry with shrimp, and the boyfriend had the chicken sausage pizza. My curry was more like yellow curry with a lot less flavor. And the potatoes were kind of crunchy, too. Pizza was fine, nothing special.   The first time I went (for take out) I got the shaved turkey sandwich which was pretty much flavorless.  Even writing this review is making me feel flavorless and boring. Sorry guys.   I am really torn between 2 and 3 stars, because our server was so amicable, and our drinks were good (albeit reaaaally slow). But overall I have a much more 2-star feeling about this place. Meh.

I love this place. It should come as no surprise because I am there probably every other week! Squid Ink is not your typical hole-in-the-wall sushi place, it has some serious class.  Hands down, the best sushi I have ever tasted. And I'm not alone in my thoughts on this, I have taken many a friend and the consensus is that this place rocks! Their salmon nigiri - dear god - it's heaven. And a really nice cut, too. Ask them for some fresh wasabi leaves (it's actually pickled but whatever) to put on top instead of the paste you usually get. Way spicier. Way tastier.   Their specialty rolls are fantastic as well - the Tahoe is my personal fav with all sorts of crab stuffed inside and on top too! For something a little lighter I also dig the smoked salmon and jicama. That jicama gives it JUST the right texture. Mmm crispy, crunchy, fresh... holy geez I want one right now!  As far as their other food goes - I always order sushi. But I have had bites of other things and it has all pretty much blown me away. Wait wait, I lied. For brunch one day I did indeed get one of their specials - some little fried rice and kimchi number with an egg on top. The flavors sent my brain spinning!  The bartenders are super attentive and the drinks are good... they have a vanilla and jalapeno martini that I have a hard time resisting. But what can I say, I'm a freak about anything spicy.   The staff here has always been excellent - quick, friendly and might I say rather attractive? Is that allowed here on yelp? And the atmosphere and décor are awesome - all the art is original paintings and it has a rather trendy, chill vibe. They also have these big garage doors that open up to the patio that makes it kind of feel like you're near the beach. Oh and on Tuesday nights they have live music and LIVE PAINTING on the patio!  Live painting? At a restaurant? Sweet! Finally a little culture in Peoria. It's about time.
