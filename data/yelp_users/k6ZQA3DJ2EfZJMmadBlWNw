Saying you like the OSF to some people seems to be the equivalent of saying you like to eat dog turds off the street. Foo on  you.  OSF doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. It is a basic, solid, basic, unpretentious, basic, fun restaurant; it's the type of restaurant that is disappearing in this country, where we are rapidly becoming a nation of two choices: fast food or upscale. Here you will find generous sized portions, friendly service (almost over-zealously so), and a crowd of diners that are genuinely enjoying their experience. There is always at least 1 birthday song going on somewhere in the restaurant, and I've heard as many as 4 during one visit. You'll see a cable car, you'll hear creaking floors, you'll have ice cream (included) in a small metal dish.  The salads are 100% iceberg. Want field greens or Romaine? Not here. Go somewhere else. The bread usually comes out so hot that you have to wait for it to cool. It tastes much less mass produced than the breadsticks at Olive Garden these days. You can have your spaghetti in the regular size or get the larger portion "for the hearty appetite". Where do you see that anymore? They have mizithra cheese. You won't find that at Bucca di Beppo. They have spumoni ice cream. Sorry, didn't notice that the last time I was at Gelato Spot.   It's gotten to the point that I end up dining at OSF alone, with my Kindle. I hear laughs, fake puking sounds, see turned up noses when it is suggested. I've given up. It's definitely retro in atmosphere, and anything but trendy, but its consistent and satisfying.

Most helpful and friendly pharmacy staff that I've ever encountered. The drive thru can be slow, and watch out for Boxcar Willie out in the parking lot.

Good pub grub.  The best fried pickles I've had in Phoenix so far. So many places do the pickle chips, but I prefer the spears. AG has nice, big spears fried in a tasty batter with ranch. From 4-7 you get 6 big spears for $3.  The beef stroganoff is great too. Once you get past stroganoff using bow tie pasta you'll love it.  A little loud at times, lots of sports on the various TV screens, crowded bar area.

I must emphasize that this is first and foremost a BAR. There are tables as well as the bar area to sit at, but it is a BAR. DO NOT go here thinking it will be sit down Italian restaurant like Aiello's etc.   The food was very good. The chicken fettuccine was tasty with the grilled chicken. The rolls? Meh. But then when did you go to a restaurant for the rolls? Unless you are a freak that goes to Olive Garden and eats their swill just to get those damn processed breadsticks.  AGAIN, THIS IS A BAR. Don't post a review slamming the decor when you didn't do your research first.

The food is great as usual. And the service there never disappoints. Jeremy was awesome.   Fondue Feast. Lager and Cheddar Cheese fondue. The meats had the advertising Latin spin for the current Big Night Out. The dessert was dark chocolate with sea salt. All was A-OK.  The table next to us was inhabited by two of the most annoying groups of diners I've ever experienced. When we arrived, the meal was winding down for a mother, her 13-ish old daughter, and that daughter's friend. If they hadn't been so young, I would have sworn the girls were drunk off their respective asses. They kept screaming across the restaurant for the waiter, thinking they were going to hook him up with their cougar mom. I'm thinking that probably wasn't an option, as I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't play for that team. But hearing yells of  "WE NEED MORE NAPKINS JEREMY" was enough to make want to throw hot bouillon over the wall onto their skank little heads.  We had about 15 minutes of quiet after they left, until this weird older couple was seated at the same table. The woman had a ghastly hat that looked like she had shopped at Savers for a hat to wear to the Churchill Downs. It was white with lots of lace and feathers and crap. And she left it on the entire meal. They went on an on with the waiter about how it was their 24th anniversary, we got to hear about restaurants that the husband was "forbidden to go to" because of his flatulence, we were subjected to them listening to Jack Johnson on their phone, and had to hear their incessant nincompoopery while we finished our dessert.  Love the Melting Pot, but maybe will go to one in a different area of town next time.

We had a very enjoyable dinner here last night. The parking lot was PACKED so we were expecting a wait, but when we got in there was a normal crowd and no wait. Surely all those people weren't at Fleming's?  FOOD: The chips with three salsas appetizer was ok, but kind of pointless. They bring you a skillet of cornbread automatically, so paying for chips and average salsa is kind of a waste.  We both ordered the steak, which had a very tasty chipotle cream sauce on top. Included were garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed seasonal vegetables. In our case, this meant zucchini and carrots.  The steak was cooked well, exactly as ordered and was a good cut. I had originally eyed the chile relleno until I noticed that it was stuff with, among other things, raisins and apricots. No thanks.  They have a really good brunch that I've been to as well, with a "Bloody Mary Bar" where you get the liquor and the glass and get to choose your mixer, veggies, etc.

Not exactly close to ASU, but definitely has a college vibe to it. You can pick up brochures to join the local chapter of Amnesty International, New Times, and see an age range from parents with kids, to groups of older men meeting for coffee and breakfast, to college kids with their books.  I also appreciate establishments that don't play canned Clear Channel or satellite radio and allow the staff to choose the music. When I was there Sunday they were playing "The Queen Is Dead" from The Smiths. You certainly wouldn't hear that at Einstein's.  My favorite breakfast bagel sandwich is the "August 22, 1988" for $4.99 (Chili Tapin Sauce, Egg, Sausage, & Pepper Jack Cheese). It's named after the day the Phoenix Cardinals made their debut. (I had assumed that was the hottest recorded day in Phoenix, but was incorrect).  The Chili sauce definitely gives it a swift kick to your tongue. A great breakfast bagel sandwich for that enjoy it on the spicy side.  They have your basic fare as well, and lunch sandwiches and salads.  I want to also agree with Alexandra K. and cheer for the salt bagel. It seems to be disappearing from most bagel shops so I'm thankful they have kept theirs.

I wouldn't call it 'authentic'. My favorite for that is Los Dos Molinos, but Abuelo's is my favorite of the chain Mexican restaurants. My favorite is the Nogales which is basically two burros, one chicken and one shredded beef, with different sauces on each.  You should order: Papas con Chile as your side dish. YUM. Also, you can have two fried eggs added on top of your enchiladas, burros, whatever. I love that and not many places offer it.

The food is decent, but for fast food I can't handle the SLOW service. The two ladies that routinely take the orders and call them out when ready have to be the slowest fast food workers I think I have ever seen.  Neither are friendly. They both seem to be hating their job.   Ordered: Nachos with grilled chicken. Decent. But when I have a half hour for lunch I don't want to spend the majority of it in line so Mary Worth can make her extra spending money behind the counter.

The Sunrise Sampler, no need to look anywhere else on the menu.  Two eggs, bacon, sausage, AND ham, hashbrown casserole, biscuits and gravy, grits, and fried apples. And it is only $7.99 for all that food. If you don't want one of the items, you can get more of another. I usually skip the grits and apples and go for double casserole and double biscuits and gravy.  It is seriously filling and completely tasty.  And healthy too! LOL.

I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's. If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here at all.  Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch. I'm not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank.  Fair warning.

Best breakfast bagel sandwich I've ever had. Sausage, egg, and cheese on a salt bagel. The bagels are obviously boiled/baked the correct way and taste homemade. Service is friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back.

Not many chains sell salt bagels anymore, so I'm very happy about that. Service has always been fine on my visits and the breakfast bagel sandwich is tasty.  LOOK OUT for the skank that is a regular there and will almost knock you down to get into the place before you. She'll then order her "regular" with her flippant attitude (blueberry bagel with butter, but "LIGHTLY toasted, just a LITTLE brown"). Then her and her nebbish husband will take the biggest table in the place and spread newspapers all over it and she will read hairstyle magazines.  OH, she'll also completely trash the drink station with her obvious inability to do anything for herself. Ugh. Makes we want to vomit even writing about her.

Very disappointing. Hardly any wait, and now I know why. We went a couple years ago when it first opened and had great food, but it has really gone downhill.  THE FOOD: Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits are listed as jalapeno, but there was no jalapeno flavor at all. The gravy was decent. The roasted potatoes were not cooked enough and were too raw to cut with a fork.  The Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.  Belgian waffle. Decent. It's kind of hard to screw up a waffle.   SERVICE: The service was good. Attentive without being annoying.  It is definitely a place where the annoying of Scottsdale seem to flock to. I was expecting to see cameras come in to film an episode of Real Housewives of Scottsdale.  We won't be back.

Giving Durant's a 5-star review isn't really all that shocking. It's the Meryl Streep of steakhouses in Phoenix. Still, a recent visit merited a review.  I had a reservation for 4 for a dual birthday celebration last week. The group grew to five and I phoned to ask if that was OK. The maître d' informed me that they could accommodate, but since 80% of their tables were 4-tops, it might be a half hour or so. Not a problem. We just went to the bar.  We were seated in a booth after about 15 minutes. None of us are exactly slender, and the booth was a tight fit for sure, but we were willing to adapt based on the late change in the reservation. Our waitress, the wonderful Rebecca, would have none of that, and promptly cleared off a recently vacant two top and slid it over and created a much more comfortable dining area.  We started off with drinks and appetizers. Four at the table had the shrimp cocktail, and the shrimp were anything but. With a seafood allergy, I settled for the onion rings. I was pleased with my choice as they were large rings of sweet onion, dipped in a perfectly seasoned batter.  I ordered the prime rib, but was first treated to a very satisfactory dinner salad with (obviously) house-made blue cheese dressing and crouton. When the meat arrived (the medium sized portion), it was cooked to medium rare perfection. I was pleasantly surprised at the heat of the horseradish. This was no wimpy horseradish cream sauce like you get at many steakhouses these days. The garlic mashed potatoes were a great contrast to the bite of the horseradish.   And lastly, the desserts. At our table there were three orders of key lime pie and one order of the trio of crème brûlée, along with various cappuccino and coffee orders. The fresh mint sprig on the top of the key lime pie was a nice added touch. And for birthdays? No cheesy song from the waitstaff. Instead, a simple candle on the pie. Perfection.  Rebecca was just what you would expect the staff at Durant's to be: knowledgeable, genuinely friendly, unobtrusive, and unflappable. The perfect addition to a wonderful birthday meal.  We left with our belts let out a notch and our wallets empty, but it was definitely worth it.

Let me start off by saying that I've never been a fan of Fez. And let me now clarify that and say that I'm not a fan of the food, but I'm a fan of the service and the professionalism. I've never had anything cooked bad, etc., I'm just not a big fan of their menu. Personal choice. But several people in my dinner group love it so we go there from time to time, and I suffer through it.   I was in charge of the arrangements tonight, and I used their website reservation system to make reservations for 12 on Wednesday. I stand by my Quick Tip stating that this reservation system is really, really bad. This is the wording from the website: "Complete this reservation request form and we'll contact you ONLY if there is a conflict or question about your reservation. Otherwise consider your request fulfilled!" You get no confirmation, nothing. I didn't hear anything from them, so I assumed that the reservation was good to go. Guess what? We arrive and there is no reservation. Twelve hungry, some bitchy, gay men of a certain age with no dinner reservation. I can feel some of you shuddering right now.  And then the magic happens. Chelsea (more on her later) comes up and appeases us in the best way a good fag hag with experience will do. We were assured that they would "make good" and find a way to accommodate us, and after apologies all around from waitstaff and management alike, we had several small tables pushed together and were seated. No small feat for a Friday night at 7 pm. We were informed that we would have comped drinks and apps for the trouble.   Eddie: Is Champas all right with you Pats? Patsy: Lovely darling. Eddie: Should we finish off the beluga or should we have some smoked salmon nibbly things?  The only app I sampled was the hummus, but there were several other offerings that were scarfed down, along with some pear martinis and pomegranate libations of some sort. I was going to order my old Fez stand-by, the blue cheeseburger, when Chelsea informed us of the special of the night. A chicken cordon bleu variation with honey mustard sauce and mashed potatoes. Sold. The chicken was pounded flat with a great Panko crust and the sauce had a sweet tang that was really quite good. I wish this was on the menu all the time.   Chelsea handled a large table of obnoxious, randy queens like a pro. Working at Fez, I'm sure she has had her share of snatches on parade, but her humor and unflappability were greatly appreciated. What started off as a potentially horrible night turned into one of the most fun and memorable dinners our group has experienced in a long time. So Bravo! Fez. I stand by my statement about the reservation system, and I still won't say I'm a fan (personal taste), but I won't cringe when Fez comes up on the go to list from now on.

I found the portions to be very small for the price. I had the garlic chicken for dinner and the amount of chicken in the dish probably added up to the size of a small kitten.

I'm updating my review of Feeney's, as when I read the review of my initial visit, I was sort of shocked. It is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  First, make sure you check out their website for the nightly specials. Wednesday night is particularly great, with your choice of 5 freshly prepared entrees, including potato or vegetable, AND soup or salad for $10. Nice.  Second, when you check in on yelp, look for the instant 10% off coupon. Immediately. For that use. Not a "10% off after 4 visits" or a one time use. Every time. Nice.  Third, I am always a bit taken aback by the sincere friendliness of the staff, especially the owner. She always remembers us, even when we haven't been for a few months and we are always greeted with a big hug and a hearty "Hello! Welcome back!". Nice.  Fourth, the salad bar that I was unimpressed with in my first review impresses me now not for its variety, but for its consistently fresh and always well stocked bounty. Not only leafy salads on the salad bar, but some slaws, a few pasta salad choices, and lots of very fresh veggies. And I'm a sucker for the carrots that have been shaved into curls and the cool fresh ground pepper mill. While you are getting your salad, the chef(s) will routinely visit with you, as the kitchen is right behind the salad bar. Nice.  On my visit last night, I started with the onion rings as an appetizer. They were good. No flavorgasm like the ones at Durant's, but then how could they compete with those? I had the $10 special Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and salad. Salisbury steak has been much maligned by the Swanson TV Dinners of old. When done right, and Feeney's does it right, it is a flavorful piece of ground prime steak. Here's a hint, if they ask you how you want your Salisbury steak cooked, you pretty much know it is going to be better than the chopped steak meal you are going to get at other restaurants. The mushroom gravy is an added treat for both the steak and the mashed potatoes. Another at the table subbed the fresh veggies for the potato, and they were a nice assortment of zucchini, squash, and broccoli. Not a limp, greasy garnish like you get some places if you opt out of the potato portion. Nice.  Another hug upon our leaving. Goodbyes from the waiter and the bar staff. You can easily see why most of people you see in Feeney's are regulars. Count me as one now.

One of the most frustrating layouts of a restaurant I've ever been to. Two "front" doors, bathrooms placed too far away from the bar and the dining area, strange patio layout.  FOOD: Possibly the best French onion soup I've had in Phoenix. The burger wasn't earth shattering, but was good.

Yes, it is a market obviously targeting the Hispanic market. But don't let that deter you from shopping here. The hot food counter, OMG! So many different foods to choose from, along with just off the griddle tortillas, Horchatas, etc. Phenomenal.  They have one of the best produce sections I've ever seen. If you are a fan of different peppers, you will be amazed. Also, many fruit selections that you won't see in your local Fry's or Safeway, or much cheaper than they would have. Mangos for days.  Wander the aisles and discover some new favorites. Tamarind juice? Check. Instant flan mix? Check. The list goes on.  Don't leave without a walk past the butcher counter, where you will likely see an entire cow head for sale.

Can't say enough good things about Meikle Moving. It was my first time paying for movers and they came highly recommended from a friend. The cost was very reasonable, the two movers that came to get my furniture were prompt, speedy, and very careful.  The only negative (and it really isn't a negative about them) was when their truck broke down on the way to my new place. They stopped the clock and transferred everything to a new van and everything progressed quickly after that.  I'll definitely use them the next time I move.

I'm not kidding when I say these were the best nachos I've ever had. Amazing chili flavor with the chicken, black beans, fresh chips. Just great.  Others at the table had THE MAC 'n Cheese and said it was pretty good as well.  I still don't understand how some of the "games" aren't considered straight-up gambling. There was a teenage girl sitting at a slot-machine that dispensed tickets. Yes, it isn't money, but still is just a little too close to a Vegas slot machine for my taste. And I have loose morals.  Just sayin'.

Look for the guy that sells the spicy pickled items. Free samples. The spicy pickled asparagus ROCKS!  Show up an hour before the scheduled closing time or you will have limited selection. They start packing up early.  Pinnacle Farms has a great no contract food co-op. Make sure you ask her about it when you see their booth.

This review is based on two visits. One was hands down a 5 star experience. The second was a 3 star. Let me just say before I get into the review that I LOVE this restaurant. And will go back. Many times. Every visit to any restaurant isn't going to knock the ball out of the park.  THE FOOD:  On the 5 star night, I was out with my boyfriend and his friend and we all thought our dishes were great. I had the lasagna, which had just the right amount of spice in the sausage. Nice sized portion, perfectly cooked. Others had a spinach ravioli dish and the pesto gnocchi dish. All of our plates were as clean as we could get them. If there would have been any of the bread left, I might have used it to sop up the small amount of sauce remaining.  On the 3 star night, I was with a large group. I had the Chicken Fiorentina. I had to fight myself to not order the lasagna again and to try something different. I wish I had stayed with the lasagna. There was nothing wrong with the chicken at all. Cooked great, nice creamy panna sauce, perfectly cooked green beans on the side, just not as big of a fan of it as I was of the lasagna. Next time....   Several people had the chicken cacciatore and professed it delicious.   THE SERVICE: On the 5 star night, we had the service you would expect for a 5 star review. She was attentive, charming, gave valuable opinions/information on what to order. Wonderful.  On the 3 star night, I didn't have a problem with the service at all. This is based on what others in our group have said. Some said he was inattentive, seemed bored, insincere, etc.  Again, just like the chicken vs. lasagna argument above, I would have preferred to have the waitress from the first night, but the waiter from our second visit was fine. One person in our group manages a Scottsdale restaurant and I asked him if he was finding the service lacking. He had a good point when he said, "If I was waiting on 10 gay men of a certain age, I would be falling all over that table." It's true. Gay men as a group tip handsomely.  I'll say it again though. I LOVE this restaurant. I love that Joe comes out and chats with you. I love the ambiance. Maybe someday I'll try something else on the menu, but next time is definitely the lasagna again.

All of us had breakfast, of sorts. My grilled cheese on sourdough was pretty basic. I think I paid $7 for some melted cheese slices on toasted sourdough.  Other items ordered by my group: breakfast burrito ("Sorry, we're out of salsa"), said to be decent, but again pretty basic. Another ordered a veggie burger and it was suggested to add fried eggs to it, which he did. He said it was very tasty.  Will I go back? Probably not. That was a long haul from Phoenix. If I find myself some morning in Cave Creek I would consider it.   Oh, and also no (or broken) air conditioner. FAIL!

I really had my doubts about this place, and my dinner group went there sort of as a joke. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was sort of an A-List Hooters type in a D cup. All pleasant as can be for being visually raped hundreds of times a night by Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel and friends.  THE FOOD: Deep fried mac 'n cheese appetizers. Damn those things are addictive! I could have eaten an entire basket by myself. The ranch dipping sauce adds just the right amount of coolness to the triangle of ooey-gooey goodness. I had T.K.'s "Diablo" Chile Chicken Sandwich: Grilled chicken breast, fire roasted Ortega green Chiles, Swiss cheese, bacon and jalapeno mayo. Being from New Mexico, I'm skeptical about how anyone else does green chile, but this was just right. Tender chicken breast with two BIG green chiles sliced and laid on the burger providing a perfect amount of heat to the chicken. Not sure I even detected the jalapeno mayo, and I got some regular mayo on the side for the fries and ended up adding it to the sandwich as well. Others at the table had steaks and said they were acceptable, but not great. The freedom fries were standard fries, but tasty.  THE EXPERIENCE: Too many entrances. We were meeting as a group and everyone came in a different door. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but this place is HUGE. We were there on a Friday night and halfway through the meal couldn't even hear each other because the live band had started.  I would defnitely go again, but not on a night when they had live music.

I go here for lunch from time to time because it is close to work.   If you have little kids, you will love this Chick-Fil-A. If you don't, it will annoy the hell out of you. Guess which category I'm in?  It's like trying to order food inside of a daycare center. The little kids scream and run around continually with their balloons. I expected to start hearing some sing-song rhymes and jump-rope chants. This would be fine on its own, but the staff seem to cater to the kids at the expense of everyone else. Today the line was stopped so that a red balloon could be located. "She really wanted to have a red balloon, not a yellow one." Too damn bad!  I can't complain about the food, it's consistently good. It's just a frickin' headache to get food here.

They commit the ultimate sin for a coffee shop: milk is NEVER available over at the drink station. No milk of any kind. And then when you go up to the barista stand to ask for milk, some of them give you the stink-eye.   If it didn't have the built-in traffic from the movie theater next door and American Express and Petsmart, this Starbucks would tank but fast.

1. The tomatillo red is the absolute best. I could eat it on anything.  2. They have a great app for your phone. It stores your favorite order, your card # (if you want), and you just click, send the order, walk in, laugh at everyone waiting in line, and get your food.

We usually eat there every Monday. I used to get the spaghetti and meatballs special, but got kind of bored with it. The mac and cheese is great; the best pizza is the mushroom/sausage/pepperoni.  I was very disappointed with the manicotti when I ordered it. And the buffalo chicken "sandwich" is interesting, almost like a flatbread taco.

If you are looking for a basic pizza, this is not the place to go. They have an excellent crust, and they have gluten free options and also tofu "meat" toppings if you so desire. They also have different sauces (white, pesto, traditional) and different toppings (artichoke hearts, Portobello mushrooms, etc.)  The calzones are great also, and big enough to feed two.  TIP: Order one of the "named" pizzas on the menu if you can find one that suits you. If you build your own custom pizza or calzone you may get a bit of sticker shock when they bring the bill.

I felt like I had walked into a bad 80s music video. The prices are good sure, but would I really wear a pink and neon plaid shirt or black pants with suspenders? No wonder our youth are getting bullied.

I'll probably be stoned to death and lose my pink card for this review, but I've given Bliss a chance three times and was sorely disappointed all three. From inconsistent service, to snooze-inducing food choices, I just can't go into the rapturous food orgasms that many of my locals seem to have when eating here.  I haven't done the reBAR side of the combo, so all I can speak of is the restaurant. I like the space, and sure the staff is cute (in a sort of frat-boy/porn star way), but I need good food with my eye candy.  Things I have tried: 1) the chicken soft tacos -- no flavor and HEAVY on the purple cabbage. 2) loaded mac n cheese -- I prefer the mac n cheese at Switch, hands down. 3) buffalo chicken sandwich -- decent taste, but a total mess to eat.

First let me address the decor. Everyone seems to love it, but I felt like I was eating inside of a Crate and Barrel store. One of the people with me said he felt like he was in a renovated Red Lobster. I do have to say the bathroom had some of the best lighting I've ever seen.  FOOD: All of us ordered the red velvet pancakes after seeing them reviewed on Chow Bella. I'm not really a pancake person, but I wanted to try it since it was something I had never had. They were truly great. Very rich, but very good. The Gran Marnier syrup was my favorite part. I had to ask for more. The bacon was tasty and crisp. I ordered a side of poached eggs. They were just a tad shy of done, too much of a runny white for my taste. And I should have ordered some toast or something to sop up the yolk with.   DRINKS: For their Sunday brunch, you can get any entree and bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, or screwdrivers for $24. The most expensive entree is $15 and the drinks stand-alone are $5, so you would need to have at least 3 drinks to make this a worthwhile "deal", but it is brunch. Booze it up.  SERVICE: Spotty. It wasn't really very busy and it was difficult to get the attention of the waitress. We asked for separate checks (I know, scandalous in Scottsdale) but were told that would be no problem. Then the check came as a group. No biggie.  Would definitely go back, but will get the steak and eggs next time.

I can't say enough good things. Every thing you've read in other reviews is true. Great service and sublime food.  We were a group of 8 and the waiter gave everyone equal attention. We ordered the fritters and the pretzel bites for appetizers. Both were great. The pretzel bites and cheese are addictive.  As an entree I ordered the short rib stew, and attached a pic of it. The rib meat was tender and tasty, and it had just the right amount of heat from the green chilis. Amazing cornbread too. Others ordered the fish and chips, and the sloppy joe; all were happy with their orders.  I'll definitely be back.

Hey hipsters. Join the lines at Windsor. And they are pretty much worth it.  The wait for 4 on a Friday night was about 30 minutes, not horrible. We were seated in a big booth with plenty of room.  THE FOOD: We ordered the cheese fondue appetizer. The bread and apples were great in it, but we were a bit confused by the pulled pork on the side. Should we stir it in? We ended up putting it on top of the bread after being dipped in the cheese.  I had the Windsor burger. I have read reviews treating it like it was the second coming. I wouldn't go that far, but it was a good burger. Juicy and obviously hand formed, with smoky carmelized onions and the rest of the fixins. The fries were suprisngly tasty, not just a throw-away side dish.  Others at the table had the pastrami sandwich which was proclaimed "interesting", but very tasty.  THE SERVICE: Adequate. Not great, not bad.   THE DECOR: The wall of cassettes is amazing. Look at my pic, that is my favorite. I have become obsessed with what I think might be on that mixed tape.  Will I go back? Sure. But I'm going to wait for the frenzy to die down a bit.

From the other reviews I've read for this location, they seem to be having problems getting their act together, but both visits I've had here have been great experiences.  The service and perkiness almost borders on annoying. Almost. They have just he right amount of friendliness and sincerity to not cross over into the cloying territory. Drinks were never empty, the check cycle was quick. What more can you ask for from your waitstaff?  The Alfredo the Dark pasta (with chicken) never disappoints. It is big enough to take half of it home and have a great meal the next day as well. The salads are huge. Even what they have as a "side" salad is meal sized dish of fresh Romaine, Parmesan, and tangy Caesar dressing.

We were thrilled to see that Joe was opening Charr in Moon Valley along with Mini-Aiello's and his awesome pizza place. We were not disappointed.  From the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to Joe himself coming to chat with us, you feel like you are a regular at a restaurant that you've been going to for years. We were seated and ordered drinks, some alcoholic and some not, and all were good. The dirty Grey Goose martini was especially good. It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.  For our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a "miss", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.  Various burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches. Everyone loved the obviously fresh-made garlic knot buns and fresh toppings. The sauteed crimini mushrooms and carmelized onions on my steak and blue sandwich were awesome. If you are a fan of the blue cheese, ask for extra. It was a little skimpy on my sandwich for my taste.  We were offered the desserts (made by Joe) including bread pudding and an apple crumble, but we were all too full to try those. Definitely next time.

If I could give no stars I would. Mandatory $10 parking on game days is the ultimate insult and rip off. And the attendants taking the money are rude and surly. You'll feel like you are dealing with the mafia, which isn't far from the truth. I feel bad for the retail stores stuck in their contracts with this hell-hole. Do yourself a favor and drive up to Anthem or wait until the Premium Outlets in Chandler open in a few short months.  I was worried Tanger Outlets in Glendale would put the Anthem Outlet out of business. I'm not worried anymore.  Probably the biggest business fail in Phoenix for 2012.

Everyone, when considering Mr. Troncellito, make sure you read the filtered review on here, as he has responded to Nestrelda's review. I'm not quite sure why his is filtered, and her hatchet job is left to stand, but so be it.

The dairy case next to the diapers. Perfectly logical.
