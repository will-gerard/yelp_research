Brought my ring in to be sized they told me it needed a new shank which would cost $216. Within the first 3 days of getting it done I lost a diamond. The guy tells me this happens because when they size it, it will expand the prongs. After getting it back within 24 hours the same diamond falls out. So I bring it back. 3 days later a different diamond falls out. You would think they would cover it because I paid $200+ and it is their fault the diamonds are falling out. But because I don't have Jareds warrenty it is now going to cost me $400+ to fix all the prongs. They claim it is not their fault and that I must have worn down all the prongs at work or at home. Weird, I never had a single problem with it until they touched it. Will never ever ever go back EVER!

I brought my husband and my friends that were in town from Chicago. When we left our cheeks (face cheeks) hurt so much from laughing. Howard the owner was the funniest, he invloves you and interacts with the audience. We left and couldn't stop talking about the show all the way home. Thank you for such a fun night out!
