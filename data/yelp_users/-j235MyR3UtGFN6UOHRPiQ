Very cute authentic looking decor,  our waitress was very nice and made suggestions since it was our first time here.  The chips came out hot and green and red salsas were tasty and hot. I liked the red, yum!  I ordered a beef taco and cheese enchilada,  both very good and we're piping hot! They have you a huge portion too so go with an appetite, I'm STUFFED and my plate still looks full.  Prices are fairly low considering how much food you get. I would come back and try this place again.

Came here for a friend's birthday,  staff was very attentive and food was excellent! I ordered the cowboy steak over beans and it was cooked perfectly.  I think we had 8 people in our party and every one of us was ranting and raving about the flavor and freshness of our dishes. My boyfriend ordered the salmon with fingerling potatoes,  delicious.  Looking forward to our next meal here....great place!

I cannot even begin to tell you how angry I am about my experience here.  My family is Italian from NY and I drove almost an hour to try out this place because of its reviews.  We pulled into a dark divey parking lot, next to an appliance part store. We walked in and my first thought was that they were busy, so that's good right? The decor is sterile and outdated, no music and in need of some warmer inviting ambiance. We were told it will be would a few minutes since we didn't have a reservation, although there were still tables open, so we waited 10-15, no big deal.   We finally get sat, and a lady brought over water and bread. We looked over the menu and planned what we were going to order. The waiter finally came over 10 minutes later and got our drinks and told us the specials....then walked away.  We waited another 15 minutes for him to return which never happened. By this point,  I have been here over 30 minutes and felt like we were absolutely being ignored and judged on purpose. Btw, the server was an older gentleman, gray hair. I own a business,  if one of my employees treated a guest like this I would be embarrassed.   I would not recommend this place...ridiculous customer service.

We came across Los Taquitos at the Taco Festival in Scottsdale a few years back and been going there ever since. The staff is always friendly, the place is clean and the prices cannot be beat!  My favorite is the carne asada tacos (Mexican street tacos) and they are 1.15 a piece, you cannot beat that! Definitely worth a try, you will not be disappointed. :)

There's clearly a reason this place has two stars. Customer service seriously sucks, aside from unfriendly and lack of personality and bad attitudes,  they served us rotten vegetables on our bagels, approximately 3 little slimey cucumbers is not acceptable ...and every table is dirty. I hope the management is paying attention, the parking lot is packed so it's definitely not the location...it's your employees.

A little concerning when there's only a few cars in the parking lot, this should have been my first red flag. Server was nice enough,  place was clean (since that's really all there was to do with 3 tables of people). My boyfriend ordered the prime rib with crab legs, he was happy with his order. Personally,  I thought his prime rib was a little salty. I ordered a sirloin that looked almost boiled,  but was not seasoned and tasted beefy.  Our Server was nice and exchanged it for a rib eye. It looked soooo much better but again beefy tasting, and SUPER fatty. Very disappointing!  The manager came over again, I explained that although this was better it's still not great because it's really fatty and beefy in flavor, he apologized and said he would adjust the bill. When we got the bill, he took 15% off and went back to the bar he was sitting at when we walked in. I will not be coming back, absolutely lost a customer.

I highly suggest going to the McDonalds on McClintock and Elliot, aside from always getting my order correct and fill my soda all the way to the top but they also hire cashiers who know how to count change correctly.   At this location, there's countless times that the concept of fast food is waiting 20 minutes only to get stale bread, cold french fries and the genius giving change cops an attitude when you correct how much change he owes you. This location is in desperate need of a severe Ronald ass kicking! Shame on the management, can you even try to care about your customers.

We have been here a few times before and just realized ive never left a review for them.  This place is truly a diamond in the rough for Scottsdale hidden on Scottdale and Shea.   The salsa Is flavorful and fresh, sooo good. My favorite is the chicken fundido, highly recommend. I posted a pic too.  Staff is attentive and at 6:30 there are few booths available,  don't let that discourage you.... Just tells you its great.  I know another post commented on the ventilation,  no idea wth they are talking about. Place does not smell, it's old but it's clean. Try it... It's worth my 20 min drive!

We visited the location on Alma School, pizza was OK, The Tempe location is definitely better in both food and service.

We've been looking for a custom design ring for our engagement/wedding for well over a year and a client of mine had highly recommended  Gauthier. We had stopped by twice before and they were closed, so we were in the Old town area again and stopped in. I was excited and looking forward to seeing their showcases and having something created. My suggestions is to maybe call and make sure they are open before heading over there.  The jewelry is unique, brilliant and truly a piece of art...which I absolutely appreciate. I came in with pictures and elaborated on some ideas of what I was looking for.  I am giving them two stars....which has nothing to do with the beauty or quality of their jewelry but more so because of our experience. I hope you don't have the same....  What I didn't appreciate...when we walked in the sales girl seemed very nice, a little pushy but I felt like she was making an assumption we could afford ...they say "don't judge a book by the cover". Once we said that we don't have a price in mind, as this will be the one and only ring we will be purchasing in our marriage it needed to be unique and personal,  From that point,  the sales gal started showing us a ton of pictures on her ipad and rings from the showcases that were not even remotely close to what I had described. I even showed her pictures of other rings I liked. I don't think she was listening...  What turned me off was that when I mentioned I saw another Gauthier ring at a local high end jeweler's store, she immediately knocked the other jeweler by saying it was probably an estate piece and if you want something custom they are not really known for their custom work, but if we were really looking for something custom and a quality master piece then she has a selection to show us. I was ready to just leave at this point... I get it,  she is a sales person looking to make a sale..but truth is, she lost my business because how not only she treated us at the beginning but also because of her unnecessary comments about their competition. I am not comparing a mall jeweler to them...I am comparing another high end custom jeweler to them...all in all just really disappointed because I was looking forward to having them create something amazing.

We've come her a few times and usually enjoy what we order, especially if you like spicy foods.  My boyfriend ordered the Habenero burger which he really enjoyed I ordered the skewers, very healthy and a good choice if you are debating. I have also had the tacos, they were spicy but pretty tasty. The service is usually pretty good and attentive. They usually are helpful with suggestions if you are debating on what to order. If you check in on yelp, you get chips and salsa. The chips have a great flavor. I will be back, I like this place.

Location,  location, location! I respect that this business has been a fixture to old town for 37 years but if you know real momma's italian cooking this place was pretty disappointing.    Service was friendly and attentive, brought sour dough to the table.... Why not Italian bread? I ordered chicken cutlet parm and it was kinda flavorless, the chicken could have been tenderized and seasoned a bit more. My boyfriend ordered the meatballs, because the sign outside said "greatest meatballs in the world"... he said "the sign lied", we know great balls, we grew up on Italian food we're from New York.... The sauce on my pasta was acidic and overcooked. The one thing that I bitch about is when I get a pasta dish and my plate is FULL of water.  I literally poured it into another plate.  That's just a lazy cook and not acceptable, especially if im paying $50+ for dinner.   Chances are we wouldn't return to Italian Grotto. Lots of other great Italian places in the Valley.

I have drove past this place for years and always wondered if it was great. We are from New York and KNOW good Italian food. Today, I was watching Drive In, Diners and Dives and saw Guy ranting over what a great Calzone they make, needless to say we headed there for dinner.   I ordered the white pizza and a calzone...and this was a PEPSI establishment, I know that doesn't mean much to some but it does to others. Anyway, the pizza  was thin and crunchy which I like, and garnished pretty with lots of basil. The basil is what saved this pizza because it barely had any ricotta and not much flavor. I literally had 2 slices, my boyfriend had one, and we took the rest home, this is not usual. My boyfriend ordered a calzone, when it came out the bottom was completely burned, enough that scraping off the bottom wasn't enough because you can taste it through eat bite. I took his plate with the calzone upside down to the counter and asked if this looked burned to the guy at the counter who more or less shrugged his shoulders and asked us if we wanted them make another one. I just got our money back.   I was not impressed, and would not recommend this place. There are other places in the valley with much better Italian food.

Two words describe this hotel,  cluster fuck! Stayed here for a convention I had to attend and my friend booked online for a deluxe room for 4 people and requested a roll away.  Checked in at the hotel and they could not accommodate because it was a fire hazard, well this doesn't work!  I asked the cost of the upgrade and how many that could accommodate.  I was told there is a king sized bed, the couch pulls out and we could have a roll away,  an additional$50/night. We already payed for one night. My thought was cool, this might work! I put down $100 deposit on MY credit card. So, we get to the room and couch doesn't pull out. I call and talk with a manager and for the run around. She gave me $10 off making it an additional$40/night. We called back later and they said we already got one away and they are overbooked. Customer service isn't something they excel at! Looking at my bank statement I noticed that i was charged for the room, all 4 nights....my friend should have been charged but my friends just paid me but because of this disorganization it left me with -$800 in my bank account. Bottom line, we could have stayed somewhere sooo much nicer for $265/night.    Oh wait,  this gets better....aside from this place being seriously outdated,  and not clean!  Resturants are to be desired unless you want to eat at their high end resturant at $42 steak.... This is NOT Ruth Chris by any means. We found broken glass  that looked like it was used for drugs....SERIOUSLY!   I have zero intention to ever come back here nor would I recommend anyone to stay here.

I use to really like this place,  food is authentic even though the service usually sucks.  Tonight was especially bad, we came in at 8:30, and we stood at the register waiting to be seated for 10 minutes,  and that's not an exaggeration...not because it was super slammed but because the one waitress who was working just didn't care.  Almost every table was filthy and that should have been a sign to leave.    We literally waited 30 minutes for our meal,  and to say it was warm is being kind. My taco was soggy which meant it probably sat in the window. The waitress NEVER came back to check on us...so my meal just sat there because I'm not eating at this point cold mexican food and taking a chance of getting sick.    In conclusion,  this place is going on the NO GO list of places not to eat at anymore.

I am absolutely boycotting this store! And I love to shop so this should tell you that there is a serious problem. I feel like a hamster in a maze first and foremost however I have spent plenty of money here in the past but tonight I was so disgusted that I am perfectly happy not returning and paying more elsewhere.  I stood in line for 20 minutes and the lines behind me just got longer and longer...and it wasn't just my line. How about open a few more lanes to get customers check out maybe? Eventually, we got annoyed put our shit back and started to walk out My boyfriend demanded to talk with a manager, Some 22 year old kid came out saying he was the manager and we said that this was poor customer service and people in line are all annoyed, etc. His response was "That's just kinda how they do things around here." REALLY???? Sorry...lame answer, not acceptable! The quote of "You get what you pay for, and you pay for what you get" stands very true here.

I was looking forward to checking out the hype of a dine in theatre,  however this has to be the most miserable experience I've eve had in 30+ years of going to the theatre to see a movie. The seats are absolutely uncomfortable and torn up and needs recovered. The food tastes microwaved and the soda was flat and clearly prepoured because the ice was already melting. Also, I didn't love eating in the dark or all the strange smells from burgers to Brussel sprouts and add milkshakes and then popcorn...ugh!  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars was the screen was a good size and the sound quality. This place was def disappoints. I will stick with Harkins.

I've eaten here a few times and have never been let down. The crab cakes are great,  steaks,  salmon... Never a bad meak...  The food is always perfect,  the service is outstanding,  great ambience....I appreciate that th servers make suggestions and very friendly.   We went here for my birthday and I had the filet medallions with a wine portobello sauce with a green Chiles mac and cheese...OMG freaking DELISH and worth every damn dime. My boyfriend got the prime rib and swore it was the best he ever had.   When the manager stopped over we ranted and raved about our server, Michael and how awesome our meal was and she offered us a free dessert.  When my boyfriend told the manger it was my birthday...my dessert came with a candle and the server created a card with highlighter markers and had all the staff sign the card....This place is one of my favorites but tonight showed me they ROCK! Super highly recommended

Absolutely not fast food, I have been literally sitting in my car for the last 15 minutes and I still have two cars in front of me and all I ordered was a drink I am slightly pissed off. It would be appreciated if the people who work in the drive thru would have asked the people with longer orders to pull to the side 15 minutes is absolutely not acceptable.

I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD, however I would be lying if I said that this place was worth recommending. I asked the girl at the counter what did she recommend since I have not ever been there "Oh, I don't eat here, so I don't know" maybe this should have been RED FLAG number one!   I figured keep it simple, I ordered a chicken burrito and my boyfriend ordered 5 street tacos. We waited about 25 minutes, (there were 3 tables who already had their food) and when our food FINALLY came out my chicken burrito was burnt on the outside and when I opened it up the chicken inside was NASTY, well overcooked and HARD. I gave up quickly! The street tacos were greasy, I think he ate 3 of the five before he was DONE. Bottom line, save yourself the $20 bucks, there are plenty of FRESH and authentic Mexican food places around the valley, this is not one of them.

Service was pretty good, however they have Pepsi, boohoo! Salsa was tasty but the chips were stale. They ambiance was bright, colorful, nice patio...food was a 3 out of 5, however it's a Lil pricey for what you get. One beef taco with rice and beans is $11. Steak fajitas are $17. Would I try this place again? Eh probably not.

A friend told us about how great this place was and we decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and myself have over 30 years in resturant and customer service experience and I always take a moment to compliment great service, however this time  I was so incredibly disappointed that I felt it was necessary to speak out about how not only was the food FAIR but the lack of customer service was borderline pathetic.    The hummus had no flavor, and the pitas were about the same. When we placed our orders, they were out of the three dishes we had inquired about. After about 20 minutes my boyfriend's meal came out and it was cold, I then sat there for 7-10 minutes awaiting for my salad wondering why it was taking forever and as to why you would bring out one meal and not the other with zero explanation. I have had mint salad at other middle eastern restaurants however this was not so amazing, and should really be served as a side dish and not a meal, especially being $9.00 I also asked for chicken to be added which consisted for an additional $4.00 (4 pieces).  The guy who took our order was too busy in conversation with everyone else and never once checked on us, although he was sure to make eye contact with me about 5 times. Eventually, the gal who was working (Brittany) stopped over to fill drinks and see if we needed anything...she was the only positive thing about this experience.   I expressed my concerns to Brittany who went to tell the owner that we were not happy with the experience and all she can say was sorry sorry sorry and never offered to make things right,  and pushed for us to have "a little dessert to go"...which I did not want. I wanted my "meal" comped which would have been the right thing to do, aside from the apology and to leave.   The guy who originally took our order came over to apologize and did nothing but give me a list of excuses on why he may have dropped the ball... in which I called him out on, this guy really should look into another profession because customer service was not his strong suit tonight.   Bottom line, I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are many middle eastern restaurants ASU who have superior service and much better food.

Absolutely disappointed to the point I will probably never return. We went for dinner after the dinner rush at 7pm, this place was super noisy to the point where we couldn't have a conversation with people at the table. Seemed like they were seating by the rooms vs by server, so once one room was filled up they would seat in another area.   My biggest complaint is that I ordered Veal Marsala, my veal was VERY overcooked and tough to even cut into, I did tell our server who swapped out for Chicken Marsala however it took them about 40 minutes and by the time I was super annoyed and not hungry let alone my friends and family were already finished eating. Also, two people at my table ordered meatballs, they were also overcooked and came to the table luke warm, they were not eaten and asked to be taken off the bill. The manager said that the meatballs were boiled and probably at the bottom of the pot and not stirred.   Christina was our server and probably the ONLY thing positive I can say was that she was very sweet and accommodating however I would suggest giving this girl a promotion to manager as the manager who came to speak with us never introduced himself, had a bad attitude and did the bare minimum by taking the meatballs and Marsala off the bill but his attitude wasn't one of a manager should have. The only way I knew his name was that his initials are on the bill and it on the door.   And for a suggestion.....it would be really nice if they offered gluten-free pasta for those of us with allergies since they are a pasta establishment. I had 5 things to choose from, and 3 of those I couldn't eat...you know the rest of the two other options. Meh!

I walked into the barbershop with my boyfriend who requested Valarie. The emo receptionist gal explained it will be 45 minutes, she took his name and number.   We returned approximately 40 minutes later...so 5 minutes early for the appointment time, and were told it will now be at least 30 more minutes because Valarie had started another client; however the same receptionist said "you weren't here so we took someone else" then said "I called you" we confirmed she had the correct number and there was no missed phone calls...This is POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!    I have been in the salon industry almost 20 years and I would NEVER treat a customer like this.  No apology,  just lie to my face because the receptionist thought she could squeeze someone in and there were other stylist available....not acceptable!  We left and my boyfriend was pissed and will not return.

The best part about our visit at Hungry Monk was the soda,  listening to the The Thong Song, and that our server was really nice.  I really wanted to like this place since it's close to the house but I just can't.   We ordered 10 boneless honey hot wings, they were ok, not great. I prefer the wings at Zipps or Native much better. I ordered a chicken pita with chips, chicken was dry and even adding the sauce was still pretty flavorless.   My boyfriend ordered a burger and onion rings,  the cheese was sliding off the burger and he said it just tasted greasy. Onion rings were cold. He sent the whole thing back and ordered a Philly Cheese steak, said the cheese whiz had a very sharp flavor but not a fan but the seasoned fries were ok.   Chances are we probably be passing on this place, pretty disappointed.

A friend of mine suggested we meet at Hula's for drinks and dinner and from the description it sounded great, I had just hoped it would hold up to everything she said and it totally did!   The atmosphere is great, staff is super friendly and made some great suggestions and the food was really good too. The banana coconut cream pie is freaking amazing!   We will absolutely be back to this place and bring friends.

A friend recommended this little neighborhood bar down the street from where we live. Russ was our server and he was excellent, recommended customer and personal favorites and provided excellent customer service. Their menu is quite extensive so lots to choose from. I got the steak kabobs and a salad and my boyfriend got the Philly Cheese Steak, both were tasty and hot. They also serve coke products which is always a thumbs up! The was another gal there also assisting Russ and she was really friendly and filled drinks, etc. The place was clean and laid back and at 9pm at night had quite a few people there which was nice to see. Zipps is probably the closest bar similar to this place without the obnoxious staff or loud crowd...needless to say we don't frequent there but we  I will absolutely be going back to LUCKY LOU's... and would recommend this place.

If I could leave this place ZERO stars I would. Online and on their door it says open till 9:30, so when we arrived at 8:45 they were already doing side work which is fine but the gal sweeping said "you take out"...REALLY? Poor customer service,  we chose to go elsewhere and probably wouldn't give this place another try.

I cannot stress enough to NOT go here. I thought it would be a great treat  since my back was feeling tight from shopping at the mall but these "massage therapists" were super rough leaving me feeling light headed and bruised,  two days after my "massage" I seeing a doctor for a pinched nerve.  Save your dollars and go to a PROFESSIONAL and LICENSED massage therapist,

Absolutely disappointed! My pizza came out COLD, waiter never checked on us so I flagged down the manager who offered to make us  another pizza. I'm literally sitting watching the guy making pizzas throw my pizza together with a shitty attitude and slamming down the silver lid where the toppings are kept.  The manager was nice enough take both pizzas off the bill.  The manager and our waiter are the only reasons why they are getting 2 stars for doing the right thing.   I'm from NEW YORK,  and this isn't New York pizza even if they have locations there.

I have been going to Pretty Pretty Please for my facials and lash extensions and I wanted to take a moment to share with everyone that this is one place not to miss out on! Amanda is absolutely so accommodating and makes you feel like a friend from the minute you walk in her salon. She is such a sweetheart and takes the time to consult with you on your needs. This lady is a true natural talent and my skin has never looked so smooth or clear. Aside from facials I have had a few events and had her do my make up,  AMAZING! Since then I have been hooked on her eye lash extensions and get compliments every where I go! I highly recommend her and promise you will not be disappointed.

Absolutely disappointed and no intention of trying again. Service was pathetic,  our server never checked on us. They were out of diet coke. The decor was urban shabby chic meets thift store. Pizza was tasteless hardly any cheese.  Don't waste your time and money,  there's plenty of other great places in Phoenix.

After all the great press and awesome reviews ive heard I was looking forward to dining here.  My first thought was that the decor was urban shabby chic meets Goodwill garbage.  Sad but true!  My experience was absolutely disappointing and have no intention of trying it again. We were sat at a small uncomfortable table, with hard wobbly chairs.  Our server stopped by for drink orders however they were out of diet coke, because they only sell it in glass bottles, this was his explanation. Lame!   Once we ordered the pizza, we never saw our server make any other attempt to check on us. Our pizza was dropped off by another server,  and yet it was BURNT, looks and by taste. How do you bring this to the table! I posted a pic as well...This Pizza was tasteless, amd hardly any cheese yet the mushrooms were truly the only compliment i can give and the reason it deserves one star. I really don't understand the hype of this place.  I enjoy gourmet food but i assume alpo has more flavor then our pizza did.  Don't waste your time and money,  there's plenty of other tastey restaurants in that area to choose from.

Location is good and staff was friendly and after all the great reviews we thought we would give it a try. ..I have to say that for a $10 pizza I got my moneys worth. Still in search for some real NY pizza..... this place was just okay, didn't taste like they use quality of fresh ingredients.... and they have Pepsi,  eh. Chances are we wouldn't try it again.

A friend of mine recently tried this place and was ranting so we had to check it out. I called before we went because we are coke drinkers so thumbs up. Place is clean and hostess was super friendly.  Our server made some great suggestuons, the wings for appetizers are delish, doesn't need sauce because they ate good dry. We tried the fried pickles,  those are pretty yum too.   We split the full rack of ribs platter, and still have plenty we took home, HUGE portions and lots of meat on the bone. We got the mac and cheese as a side,  you have to try this. ..soooo good! I Think this meal was $23 but worth every penny consideing how much food you get.   After being piggies and tried a lil bit of everything,  we ordered the apple crisp. Very good...  I will be coming back here for sure, great service and easy going atmosphere.

I'm sooooo excited to found this lil gem of a resturant.  I love crepes, especially when they are good as this place.  I ordered the vanilla and strawberry crepe which was amazing.  I also ordered a vanilla iced coffee which was also very good. Highly recommend this place.  I see myself becoming a very frequent customer.

Came here tonight for a friend's birthday and now a huge fan of this place,  great ambiance and excellent service.  Our server, Nick made awesome recommendations and promptly accommodated requests.   I ordered the rib eye steak with Maui marinade and fingerling potatoes,  seriously ate every last bite it was so good that I didn't care how stuffed I was,  and these are HUGE portions.  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib with a loaded potato, seriously could have split this meal,  and it was incredible.   Highly recommend this place,  awesome for date night,  special occasions or something different in a fine dining experience. Definitely will be back very soon.

After completely being let down and loosing money at another jeweler, we were diligent in researching who was going to create my engagement and wedding rings.    From the minute I walked in, Lance met us at the door and was psyched about what I was looking to create, and showed me a bunch of rings they created he thought I might like for ideas. I met with Brent, and appreciated his sense of humor and passion for his work. I knew these guys at House of Diamonds were who I wanted.  The showroom is beautiful, they are completely honest and no pressure,  and one piece of jewelry is prettier then the next.   They created 3d printed molds for us to come in and see, so cool to see what it would really look like. The whole process was so fascinating and they are so accommodating, they truly made a ring I so love and proud to wear (posted a pic) and I have referred many of my friends to House of Diamonds.   Brent and Lance have become more then just our jewelers for life,  they've become friends too. Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart.  Much love and continued success

I am so incredibly disappointed after seeing 4 stars on yelp...I was so excited to try this place and when I saw they were highly rated for restaurant week, it made it even better.   We called and asked if a reservation was required, and thank GOD we did! The owner had answered our call and told us 7:45. We got there at 7:35 and there were at least 4 groups awaiting and a line out the door. The owner was greeting people and telling those without a reservation there was at least a 40 minute wait. As we stood there I noticed that at 85% of the tables, most people were just sitting with no food. I should have realized at this point I should have left. As busy as it was there was literally 3 tables that were dirty, and the busser was slower then molasses, by 8:10 we were finally sat yet were still waiting water, menus and utensils. The waitress takes our order by 8:22 and we wait...then wait some more...  At 8:41 my boyfriend's soup (horseradish potato which was hot and "pretty good")comes out along with the soda I ordered at 20 minutes ago. By the way, its RC and its FLAT. At 8:39, I flagged down our waitress and asked for my boyfriend's glass of wine...still waiting. At 8:48, my peirogie appetizer finally arrives, two bites into it and they are COLD. Needless to say I am really trying to be patient, I ask the busser to please send over the waitress. I sent back my app and when it comes back, instead of making me new ones they just resteamed the ones that were cold. I didn't think they were so spectacular, I have had better at our restaurants in the valley.   My boyfrend at this point finds this whole experience comical so he is now timing how quickly food is coming out since it is literally coming out one plate at at time, not even kidding!   At 9:02 ONE of our meals comes to the table, the other plate arrives at 9:10, We both ordered Schnitzel cordon bleu and came with other sides...both of our potatoes being cold, as in NOT luke warm. Personally, I was NOT a fan of this dish and picked it at. My boyfriend on the other hand enjoyed it.  At 9:17 the waitress finally comes to check on us.I am trying to be nice but I am so over this experience. By 9:24 the owner stops over and although very nice explains that the ticket printer backed up and when they finally got it working there were tickets everywhere and offered me dessert. I replied "no, thank you because it comes with my meal". At 9:37 the waitress comes back with our desserts, and we make a comment about the ticket printer and she replies with "Oh, I didnt hear that happened but could be"..so we ate our dessert, I order the crepe with ligonberry sauce. Crepes were tasteless, glad the ligonberries were tart to add flavor....we paid the check and left.  In conclusion, I am usually a fair and patient person especially because I am a business owner myself so I try to give local business a thumbs up,  however this experience gets two thumbs down as not only did I observe poor customer service but to sit and get excuses over 2 hours tells me there is a problem in the kitchen let alone need more staffing during a week such a resturant week, this just cant handle this much business aside from the food being mediocre. I gave them two stars one for effort and because my boyriend liked it. This is on my personal no go list.

How does this place have four stars? We came in at 6:30 on a Friday night and it was empty except for one one table.  There were two girls working who were less them excited to help us or the gentleman waiting in front of us. I asked for a steak bowl and there was literally 4 little pieces of steak in the pan..I told her I really wanted Steak,  and she said they only had chicken or carnitas. We both said we really wanted steak,  the girl (Hispanic wears glasses) turned around grabbed 3 pieces of steak from a covered pan that was NOT hot cut it up and put it on my bowl. Lame!  My food tasted like microwave saltiness,  and my boyfriend got a steak burrito and said it was chewy, salty, and rubbery.  I give them one star for cleanliness,  and one star for having coke products. I wouldn't give this place a second try.

We spent several months going from store to store comparing what we found at Pruitt's. The staff was super friendly and when comparing price and selection,  hands down this place had the best deal and we special ordered the color and I needed the chaise on the other side, no problem.  My couch was delivered in 2 weeks and was so much better then I could have asked for. We just love it. (Posted a photo)

When everyone in this place is Hispanic, and we are the only Caucasians in the place we figured this has to be authentic! The food was great! The service was great! And they serve COKE, not pepsi so that is always a huge thumbs up. I had the USA Torta, which is like a sandwich, breaded chicken, ham, pineapple and cheese with a chipotle sauce, lots of food and very good...I took 1/2 home!   I had passed this place 100 times recently and the parking lot seemed always busy. We love Mexican food so I was hesitant since I remember being a kid and going to this place when it was JB's for breakfast with my grandmother. Place was great, and will for sure back to try something else.

Very impressed!  This was my first time at a medical dispensary and everyone was super friendly, Michael helped me and was so helpful and educated me on what would be best.  I expected that I would pay more then I was to a caregiver I had been working with and I actually paid quite a bit less. Definitely will be a good to place,  highly recommended and looking forward to taking a class there.  Thank you Harvest.

Tried this place for the first time tonight.  I love that they are open late, serve coke products,  have a fun atmosphere and decor and the service was great.    Our server suggested the nachos as an appetizer... which was absolutely terrific.  For dinner,  we took his suggestion and ordered the taco sampler plate, which had rice ans beans with carne asada, carnitas and Chicken.  I have to say my favorite was the carnitas,  I will for sure order that or the carne adada next time.    I also ordered the corn, omg this was delish.... something really worth ordering.    We will for sure be visiting this place again,  a new favorite.

Pretty disappointing.... Since I saw good reviews and a friend was raving about a new taco shop and I was psyched since it was close to home.   We ordered 2 tacos each and 2 cheese quesidillas, and 2 small sodas...seems like a lot of food, especially since it was $26bucks. WRONG!    They are nothing more then small mexican street tacos, not much flavor in carne asada, nor do they give you enough meat however they are generous with shredded lettuce, isn't that great. ..oh and a knife spread of guacamole.  Eh!   They have coke which is always a thumbs up....The manager was attempting to fix the soda machine which took15 min to figure out why the machine wasnt calibrating correctly....kinda sucked eating mexican food with nothing to wash it down with til after I was done eating...I get it, it happens but how about offer water maybe.   In conclusion,  if this place was priced according to the size of their food it would probably give them another star but I really wasnt impressed  with the lack of flavor or experience so chances are we won't go back..better off saving your money and hit up a cart on AZ Ave for some authentic mexican street tacos

I am a new client and called to make an appointment and had a female problem.  I spoke to a really nice gal at scheduling who made an appointment with the nurse practitioner for me for the next day. I was definitely impressed.  I got a little lost trying to find this place, google gave crazy directions but I did find it...Note that you need to turn down Elgin where the hospital is, its in the big building in the same parking area of Chandler hospital.  Btw, go early because parking was a bit of a pain in the ass  Once I got there there was 2 receptionists, one was really friendly and the other seemed not as personable, but took care of all my paperwork; she did her job so I appreciated that.   The MA who took me back was really nice, and I met with a NP, Denise Craig who was really sweet and friendly and definitely took the time to chat with me about concerns in my paperwork and the reason for my appointment.   Definitely a way better experience then where I was going. I wouldn't hesitate to make an appointment here.

I have to admit I was hoping for the best,  especially since they have banana milk shakes which is all time family favorite.  The decor is cute however the staff lags on cleaning up tables.  Speaking of the staff, the two guys were too busy slacking off while the cook was taking orders and making the meal.  Oh, and the banana milk shake tasted like tapioca pudding so clearly not real bananas.   We ordered 2 Signature steak burgers, which looked good but ended up more like Signature grease burgers on stale bread. The meal comes up with shoe string fries that were greasy, burnt, and when I got to 1/2 way in the box were more like the crumbs of french cries of fries, REALLY!  We ate 1/2 our meal and pitched it, not worth shitting on the potty the rest of the night.  Yes, that greasy!   I would suggest going to the chuck box down the street.  But hey, thanks for the wifi I posted this review with.

I remember seeing The Drip Room on the news when they first opened,  and 2+ years later I tried it today.    The entire staff was super friendly, well educated,  and truly care that you're comfortable, making the experience great aside from the medical benefits from getting the actual drip.  Today was my first experience and it was great,  I will definitely be back. I suffer from chronic pain and fatigue and went with the inflammation drip. My fiancé had been fighting off strep throat and the flu from a month ago,  he went with the immunity drip.   I'm actually looking forward to seeing how I feel, and my next visit. Thanks ladies

I called to inquire and make an appointment to obtain my card,  everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable from the gal who answered the phone (think he name was Brianna  or Bianca) to Nicole who arranged my papers to Dr. Jordan. I was there less then an hour. Place is super clean and NOT intimidating. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get their card.

I have been to this post office many times in the past, the people who work behind the counter are usually very nice and I appreciate them...  HOWEVER today there was a line so I used the self service computer to mail a package. I paid $12.+ for 2 days but it said it would be delivered on Thursday, today is Monday...that is not 2 days. There was a man working there with short dark brown hair and mustache and beard and wore glasses. Wearing plain clothes and a name badge that was turn around but I believe it said Don. When I asked him WHY 2 days is 4 days I got a totally condescending attitude that everything is going ground and that the package could be delivered in 8 days because there are no flights and that that is just how it is and there are no refunds so I can file a complaint but that is how it is.  SERIOUSLY? USPS is having financial difficulty and this is your customer service. I felt like I just got screwed at the casino and just made a $12+ donation to USPS! I grabbed my  package and spent $23 at Fedex to ensure delivery. USPS just lost a customer!

Hula's by far is one of my top 3 restaurants in the valley and when i heard a second location was opening in Scottsdale i was excited!  This new location offera a nice easy going come as you are atmosphere and love the  large open patio.   Our service was terrific, she offered suggestions and made sure our drinks were always full.   Food was terrific, we ordered my favorite Coconut shrimp rolls with the pineapple sauce is AMAZING! I ordered the luau pulled pork with sweet potato fries, these portions are pretty generous too, I took 1/2 home. My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken with rice, johnny cakes and plantains. Very generous portions....and very flavorful. I posted pics on here too.   Highly recommend giving Hulas a try....oh, my favorite drink is called The Painkiller.    Thanks Hulas for another location, great service and delish food :)

Tried a new place that recently opened up and being adventuresome we tried Korean food. Place is clean,  nicely decorated.  Service was alright, nobody really checked on us which sucks but they are busy and mostly Asian people :)    We ordered Bulgogi which is a sweet Korean BBQ rib eye, very tasty. The shrimp fried rice was very good, it comes with a sunny side egg which was a lil weird but was good, and these two things together are plenty to share.  They also served small side plates with cabbage, tofu, spinach,  bean sprouts and one other thing.   We also got a philidephia roll which was excellent,  quite a big larger then other places and the st uff with more salmon and cream cheese.    All in all, place was pretty good however their soda is canned and tasted like a soda that had been in the sun.  They Defintely need soda on a gun. We will be back :)

We've ordered from li's quite a few times, it's close to the office and the prices are good however  today was pretty disappointing. I found a straight black hair in my white rice, needless to say I didn't finish my lunch and my coworker ended up making a few trips to the bathroom...I think it may be awhile before I can convince my office to order from here again.

My boyfriend and I have visited the old location several times and was happy to see that this family business was expanding to a bigger location.  Tonight,  we ate at the new location and I went there being hopeful, the new location is very nice, spaceous and left disappointed. We were the second table in an empty place,  kinda sad. I've seen their old place BUSY. The server who assuming a high school aged guy was nice enough but did bare minimum. I even got up to grab silverware for our table. We've continued to come here because he likes the calzones, however the pizza isn't NY pizza and kind of tasteless.  You would think it should more or less be the same.  Truthfully,  I want mom and pop shops to succeed but something is missing... maybe cooked with love :(

This place is awesome! It's 2 miles off the Wickenburg circle but well worth the drive. The staff was friendly,  place was clean and the food was authentic, fresh and flavorful. We eat a lot of Mexican food and this was seriously great.   I ordered the Macha beef Chimi and my fiancé ordered a red enchilada and chili relleno, he said his meal was "outstanding".

We eat Mexican food VERY often,  and this place truly is a gem hidden in a shopping center. Im considering this place my favorite.  Aside from fresh and authenic great food, super cute decor,  very clean and friendly staff.  I ordered Carne Asada street tacos,  which are bigger then most places came with rice and beans. Seriously, delish! You won't be disappointed..oh, and they have coke not pepsi!

We found this place on yelp, decided to go for a lil drive and check this place out. I'm glad we did. Place is cute, staff is helpful and friendly.  I ordered a Hawaii and my fiancée ordered a Baller Pizza, both were excellent.  Definitely taking the drive to come back

Dear Management, I fully support hiring senior citizens but what exactly is the job of a greeter??? Is it to play part time Barnie Fife??? This is now the 2nd time I have left feeling angry, violated and discriminated by guy (senior, bald, always at the door)working the evening shift. I bought paper towels, cleaning supplies, plastic organizers, etc and paid for them with receipt in my purse....you can SEE the plastic bags in my cart....but WE get asked to see the receipt? What kind of policy and procedures are in your training manuals? You sure as hell weren't spot checking nor are you costco. I stood outside angry, he didn't ask a few others who walked out after us....why profile me??? I own a successful business, and would rather shop at Target. Shame on your management and shame on him. Very disrespectful to your customers!!!

Just WOW! We get to the counter to order and there are three people standing there, one which was a manager, not one of them greeted us. Finally one of the gals said she could help us. We asked what size the medium is and she didn't know (not motivated to ask, but she's a kid). We ordered a medium pepperoni Pizza, 2 drinks and tokens. As we're waiting on the pizza were looking for a place to sit and almost every time table needed to be bussed. It was about 8pm so they weren't that busy and had plenty of staff. The carpet was full of food as well. Eventually, the pizza came out and it was fair to say it was tasteless and overcooked. I expected a little more since the location is fairly newer but this is just how they operate apparently. Very disappointing and have zero reason to go back.

We started with fresh chips that were hot to the table and ordered guacamole that was flavorful and creamy.  I posted a pic.   I ordered a 3 tacos, chicken, Carne and grilled shrimp and all three were amazing, I don't know which one I liked best. Beans and rice came with,  also excellent. I love that they have real Mexican coke (as well as a huge variety of other Mexican sodas).   My boyfriend got a Chile relleno, and he just kept shaking his head YES, he says it's very good.   Decor is nice,  bright colors and clean.  Staff is friendly and made great recommendations.    I'm sure we will be back many times.  Recommend!
