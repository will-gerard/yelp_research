My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.  The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for "Cha Shu Ramen" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)  The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some "roadhouses."   Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.  It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.  If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)  I think it's too small for groups over six.  Maybe we'll see you there.  Added 11/18/07 I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for "Hakata Ramen." For extra pork, ask for "Cha-shu-men" or "Cha-shu-ramen." Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.

I don't want to spend too much time on this restaurant. I've already wasted time eating there. Too salty! Too dry and too salty. I know you want more, but I've wiped it out of my mind.

We've lived here for 10 years and I've been training myself to eat hotter food over that time. The first time we went to Los Dos was almost 20 years ago and I could hardly eat the food, it was so hot. Now I just salivate when I think of it.  I used to eat the Garlic Shrimp which is tasty but not hot. I've graduated. I love the Garlic Roast Pork and the Green Chile Stew. Unlike the other entrees which normally come with rice, beans and a tortilla, the Green Chile Stew comes with rice, beans, sour cream and 4 sopapillas. Yum! It was so good! We had the Garlic Pork and Green Chile Stew last Sunday... and my hubby drove in from Gold Canyon to bring the same plates home tonight. I'm set for a few weeks now.   I'm not crazy about their salsas, personal preference.  Their chips are nice and hefty.  This is a NEW MEXICAN restaurant, not Mexican. You can compare the two things, but they're not the same.   It gives the initial appearance of being a dark & dirty dive, but it's not. It's clean. I don't have to check my seat or table before I sit. Parking can be a problem but who cares? The food is worth it.  Service sometimes lapses... see above.  I wish it was in my backyard instead of @25 miles away.

Don't give thanks here. It's been a while since I've posted, but for anyone who can't remember,  see my motto above. And I get even more pissed when it's expensive bad food!   So imagine my mood when we left Quiessence yesterday having dropped $171 for 2, (including tax & tip), on a meal that  was certainly worse than what I could make at home. I had the Date & Beet Salad, the Turkey entree, and the Apple Crisp for dessert. Served family style were, greens, Sausage & Onion stuffing, Roasted Carrots & Parsnips, Mashed Potatoes, and a bread basket.  I'll start from the beginning with the salad which was OK. Not what you'd expect for the price, but acceptable. The turkey was brined in an over salted liquid with something odd added. It was moist, but I still left slices on my plate the flavor was so odd.  The stuffing had very little flavor at all & was dry. The sausage added nothing but meat so  that the vegetarians couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes were also over salted. The carrots & parsnips were severely undercooked. Hard as rocks. Or maybe they were overcooked & dehydrated, since a few of them were mush. The greens were good. All of the side dishes were left over. There were 3 kinds of bread in the basket; a dry foccacia, corn bread, & a soaked, with oil or butter, corn bread. They all seemed like they were from the previous day, & someone had tried to save them.  We all had the Apple Crisp with Cranberry Ice Cream for dessert. It was also OK.  The Crisp was good, but needed lemon juice to cut the sweetness. The ice cream was an Iron Chef moment.  Not a good one. I removed as much as I could & poured a little cream, supplied for the coffee, on my crisp. Oh, for some vanilla Hagen-Dazs!  We were tired of counting pennies, and thought we'd splurge. We'd all been to Quiessence before, when there was a different chef. It's a lovely location, but not enough to make up for the food.  On the day that I usually give thanks for the bounty of life,  I started planning Thanksgiving dinner for next year.

Can we just keep this between ourselves? They just don't need any more customers to form a line at Sushi Ken.  I lived in Japan for four years. My husband is Japanese, & we've picked apart every sushi restaurant in the East Valley(not on Yelp, though). I should make a list.  This is where we eat sushi. We live @ 40 minutes away & drive in for a meal.(Though with the price of gas...)  In the price:freshness ratio of good sushi, Sushi Ken has it made.  It's like a real Japanese family restaurant. Giant menus with a little of everything on it. Want sushi? Got it! Kids only eat noodles? Got it! Sister-in-law doesn't eat fish? Got it! Just like home, there's something for everyone.   In addition, the sushi is actually good, fresh & plentiful. Plus, if you can read Japanese there's little signs posted around with specialties like negitoro donburi, my favorite.  Here's a little story; We've been married almost 33 years. I'm ashamed to say that until my last trip to Japan in 2004 I didn't like sushi. At the great Tsukigi Fish Market, I ate my first negitoro donburi & fell in love. I even had it as my last meal at the airport before we left Japan, and my husband has taught himself to make it for me at home.(good guy!) It was life changing!  So go to Sushi Ken, and enjoy! But let's just keep it between us so there's still some negitoro for me!

Not a current discovery, but I haven't been Yelping this year.  After major disappointments in Greek and Middle Eastern food in the Valley, I was thinking of keeping Pitta Souvli to myself. I don't want it too crowded for me to get in, but I don't want it closing either, though it seems to be in no danger. Happy hours get you drinks and some  appys at half price.  I thought the humus was bland.  It's too small for groups over 6 or 8. They have a small but good wine and beer list. Odells 5 Barrel IPA - my new fav! And I don't like IPA's.   Over the past year I've had the Gyro Platter which I adore. The meat is crisp but juicy. And instead of fries, it comes with their marvelous roasted red potatoes and a little salad. Stuffed Red Peppers, 2 meals worth of goodness. The stuffing was meat & rice, just like mom used to make. Lamb Souvlaki, tender & well seasoned and cooked. Mushroom Souvlaki... I thought it was boring, just mushrooms.    Sorry there wasn't more. I keep going back for my gyro and roasted potato fix, and I drive from Gold Canyon, folks, it's not next door.  The prices are low, even with our beers, and we've decided to put it at the top of our list whenever the question is asked, "What's for dinner?"

Sunday night dinner. After Christmas and shopping, not very crowded, we had an entire room, six tables, to ourselves since we asked for a quiet table. It's next to Barnes & Noble, so the location is perfect for me.  Don't usually go to pubs because pub grub is usually heavier than I like. And sadly, I don't drink much anymore. But I had drunk some stellar beer the week before, and wanted to have some more.  We had 2 kinds of beer on tap, and one was slightly better than the other, and the food was better than most pubs I've been to.  When we arrived, we were told at least three times in three minutes that the host would be right there.  He was, and started bringing us to the back, but he was stopped by a waitress who reminded him that we wanted a quiet place, and the front room was empty. Our waitress was very good; cheery, competent, but not annoying.   The menu is small, and has mostly British dishes on it.  Hubs had the Traditional Sunday Roast, and it was delicious. He kept raving about the gravy. I had the Fish and Chips, with cod, and they were cooked exceptionally well. The fish was heavily battered but grease free. Hubs saw a pool of something on my plate and asked if it was oil? Nope! It was juice. The two pieces were @ 12 inches long, and I couldn't finish the second piece. The fries...ah, the fries...heaven. Probably why I couldn't finish the fish. The cole slaw was an afterthought, and the only let-down. Next time I'll remember to ask for the curry sauce instead and I'll try the haddock. And the cider.

This pub is now an Irish Pub. The fish n chips was heavy and oily and I could have made my sandwich better at home.  I think this is the third or fourth change for this pub. Can't understand why a place with good location, good beer and possibilities of good food keep failing. Maybe it's because the food doesn't match.
