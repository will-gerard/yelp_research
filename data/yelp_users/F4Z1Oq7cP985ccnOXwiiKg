Terrible service and not professional at all. Supposedly he has been in service for 25years but the way he handled his business and errors was not. He charged $300 for 2 pairs of suit pants to be hemmed and for 2 jackets to have the sleeve lengths increased and the collar to be adjusted. What a waist. Never going back.

Horchata. Horchata. Horchata. Love it. Plus it goes well with any meal you get at Rollies (nicknamed it that when we were in high school 10 years ago).  Bean and cheese burritos for the classic. Add the green sauce, you won't be disappointed. If you're starting early and want a quick but still authentic mexican breakfast you can count on Rolando's. The breakfast burritos are always on point...I mean cops even come to get them!  They used to be open 24hrs but that changed to closing at midnight but still opening around 6am.   If you haven't been it's a must!

I love Capt'n Bills! I've been coming here since I was in high school and the food has been consistent! 10years and counting! Prices are more than fair especially for the amount of food you get.  I never shy away from my turkey provolone with all the veggies. Don't forget the house dressing! Best addition to your cold sub without a doubt. And if you're in the mood for a dessert don't skimp, get the brownie.  The girls are great, quick and friendly. If you see Bill he's pretty cool too since he's been running the joint for a few decades.   Don't be turned away by the outside of the building or the inside...it's been around for sometime, you'll be able to tell by all the tables-they have photos of the previous years (and I mean years) customers that used to frequent Bills.   Capt'n Bills is the best sub shop I've ever been to and will continue to go when I'm craving a sandwich.

My favorite local pizza place!  Started going here when my siblings were in high school and got hooked on Napoli's lunch special: 2 slices of cheese and a drink.  Haven't changed my order since! Except of course the addition of hot wings with a side of ranch. The slices are huge, the wings are mouth watering, and the guys behind the counter are the real deal!

Live the service and quality of products.  On the higher end but if you're looking for that stand alone splash or accent piece you'll find your wow factor here.   Staff is well versed in product and always willing to go above and beyond.

Side Bar is great!   You might want to get there a little bit early to be established in a spot and with the bartender otherwise you may go unnoticed when the place gets packed. But on most nights it's easily maneuvered and service is quick.  The place also gets loud as the night goes on due to the space being smaller than usual. But it isn't all that bad. I would t recommend having a meeting or first date there!   Go to enjoy the music, drinks, atmosphere and black/white movies they play!   I loved my Moscow Mule, the music they play and the bathrooms. ..they always have mints for you!  Check them out!

Soccer!   I've played at this park for several years both for club ball and now for women's league.  Thankfully they maintain the park by continuing to reseed fields, line them and keeping trash in the garbages.

Love the staff. Always energetic, welcomes you with a friendly smile, ask about your day and what you have going on. Line does get long but don't get turned off because they work quick to get you through it.   I'm an avid Iced Black tea or Iced Dirty Chai with Coconut milk but I've switched it up to the Iced Rebel. The team adds flavor and if you ask for a surprise they flavor it for you and make sure you try it in front of them before leaving to ensure you're a happy camper.  Thanks Dutch Bros for always being consistent!

Food is always consistent and so are the employees that greet you with up beat personalities.   Sit inside or out, either way you will get your food quickly after ordering.   I totally recommend: -Thai Chicken Protein bowl forbidden rice/sweet potato hash -Acai Bowl -Fresh juice, Kale Cleanse or Green Glory  All is so satisfying and not heavy. Best part if you don't finish it, take it home and save it for later!

Got a notice on my instagram about Nook opening recently in Phoenix. Had to come try it out for a quick bite after work.  Happy Hour 4-6pm, Hummus plate was filling and had a plethora of veggies to accompany the two large scoops of hummus.   Margherita Pizza add Chicken and their peppers. Very light but filling.

Terrible friggin service and cashiers were rude! They were not knowledgable nor did they care to assist customers find the proper food for pets. Jesse had snide comments regarding Science Diet and wouldn't help find a similar food for us.   Never coming back. Hire individuals that want to work and are interested in the well being of animals as opposed to teenagers that want to be on Facebook.

The Backyard BBQ on Sunday afternoons is really filling and flavorful. It starts at 3pm and if you're still hungry after your first plate you can ask your server for a second helping.   Red Sangria is strong and fruitful while the White Sangria is sweet.   Veggie burger and sweet potato fries are a must.

I liked the funky modern atmosphere.  I sat outside, it was humid without misters but wasn't too bad. Only negative was the lighting - there wasn't enough. Other than that the patio was legit.  Service was good. Food was even better. Taco Monday?! Who knew this was a thing. Diego Pops originators of the taco Monday kick though! We ordered 1 of each their 7 tacos featured (plenty more to select from) these were the $2 or $3 deal. Favorite was the cod, salmon, green chili chicken.   They have a killer selection of sauces/salsas they bring out too which only adds to your dish! Chips and salsa were on point, salsa was chunky and had a good kick.  Best part... CHOCO TACO!  definitely a spot to go check out.
