Pretty awesome Globe, AZ inspired Mexican food. It's not as fancy as a corporate joint but the food there in delicious. And they always have country music on. Which I appreciate! Order the #1 combo. Tamales are great

This is my go to take out place! I've been ordering here for years now and have always been very happy with the food. Some of my go tos are the beef and broccoli, lo mien, sesame chicken, and egg drop soup.  I always try to get the lunch portions because it comes with rice,  entree, and then soup or soda for way too cheap and its a lot of food!

I have never been so dedicated to any smoke shop in my life. The staff is excellent, they are knowledgeable and personable. By far the best deals in Tempe on quality glass pieces and even better prices on smokes. If u smoke American Spirits go here! For $7.50 a pack, it's the cheapest prices without driving to the reservation for spirits. Kyle is always full of interesting conversation and the other guys will do what ever they can to get you what u want on your budget. They also have mega sales from time to time with outrageously low prices on everything. Got a great selection of vapes and pens. A lot of asu and other sports related vape pens. Tons of hookah gear too! One stop shop for all your smoking needs with chill and approachable staff! Don't miss out! Head down to A&A!

I love that they offer fried mushrooms! I've always loved them and having a pregnant wife at home who constantly craves them makes my day so much better! The cheesesteaks are delicious and reasonably priced, not to mention extremely filling. The only down side is they aren't open on Sundays for the month of July. My wife and I both love this place, the staff is very friendly and helpful, food is delicious and pretty quick,  I highly recommend it.

I always order the chalupa meal and this time I decided to get a side of rice to go along with it. Well I was rather surprised to find that the amount of rice didn't even cover the bottom of the already small container. The rest of my meal was okay but overall disappointing.

Awesome place to relax! Quiet patio, friendly customers, hilarious staff. Shady all day. Wifi. And most importantly the best coffee in the whole valley. I was not a coffee or tea drinker until my buddies dragged me to coffee rush. Now I'm there almost every day. If you are looking for a place to study alone or hang with all your friends, coffee rush is the place to be night or day!

Are you looking for a country bar with a great dance floor, cheap drinks for a fun night with friends?! Stay away from moonshine. Crowded! Country swing is impossible with the crowded dance floor. Since they're open til 3am they get too packed by the end of the night with tools who aren't there to dance or drink, just to sober up and fight. Not a fun place to take a date dancing. As sad as it is to say, you'll have a way better time going to denim and diamonds. However if u wanna see Tempe police break up chick fights and watch people bleed, you might get a kick out of it. Like most places on mill, there's a complete lack of class from the patrons and staff. Bottles are $4 beers are $5. A good shot of bourbon is $6.50+.

If you are a big fan of the Mesa police department then move in here! The boys in blue are here every night handling all sorts of monstrosities. Officer Martinez from MPD quickly arrested a random drunk man trying to kick in my door one night. Thankfully Martinez and some other detectives were already on the property arresting someone else so the response time was minimal! That's the only good thing about this place. Maintenence staff changes so frequently that you're better off taking care of things yourself. Office staff is more concerned with duping more people into moving into crime central than helping you with your issues. Grounds crews will do landscaping maybe once a month. The security guards they advertise are a fraud. They could care less about your problems. I once asked a guard what the issue was with some cops that were in our court yard. He told me to mind my own business and not to be a nosey neighbor. If you like parties there's always fat bass dropping til 5am. The apartments are nice however. Everything works ok. If an appliance breaks be prepared to raise hell to get it fixed. Get the district managers email if u need to get stuff done.

By far the best Mediterranean food in the area. Serving size is enough for two meals. Price is great. Fast food pricing for healthy delicious food. Meat is fresh and cooked daily. Hummus is incredible. Chicken is spiced to perfection. Gyro is the freshest in town. The serving set up is identical to chipotle. Atmosphere is very comfortable and clean. There will be a full service bar very soon. If you need a quick meal and don't want fattening fried food this is the place for you. Most fast food pita joints are dingy and smell. This place is most certainly deserving of a five star review.
