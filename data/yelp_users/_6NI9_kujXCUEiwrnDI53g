I am sad to say that in the, ahem, 27 years that I have lived in Phoenix, I have only been to the Desert Botanical Gardens a handful of times. I obviously didn't know what I was missing. I attended the Yelp event here last spring and it was simply magical.   It is a wonderful venue for evening events and I am sorely disappointed that I was unable to go to Las Noches de las Luminarias this year because I heard it was simply amazing. I bought tickets and it got canceled due to rain. Yes, this does happen occasionally in Phoenix....like once a year, guess it was my lucky day.   I am looking forward to the next exhibit/event that I get to go to here, it is a true gem in Phoenix. And if all else fails, I will definitely be at the butterfly event this spring and at the Luminarias next winter.

I have only been here once, but I really liked it and will be going back soon:)   I met some friends here for happy hour one Friday after work and totally love it. They have awesome $5 plates in the bar and the portions are enough to share. We had the bacon wrapped scallops which came with four different sauces, they were excellent (and I'm not a big fan of scallops) and the mushroom and brie toasts (you can't go wrong when brie is involved). The food was awesome and the bartender recommended a glass of Cabernet for me, which was perfect. He didn't try to sell me on anything, he just listened to what I like and suggested I try this one. I wish I could remember what it was called, I guess I'll just have to go back.   The ambiance is cool, the bar is downstairs, very cavern-like, I dug it. It is definitely someplace you could get cozy with your date, there is a big fireplace and lots of dark booths. The only complaint I had, which didn't even really affect me, it was so dark upstairs that I would not want to eat dinner there. It took my eyes a good two minutes just to adjust after walking in. I don't know how the staff works in that environment, but the bar was not as dark, and of course that lighting is more appropriate in an underground bar.   The staff was really friendly and talkative, they were engaged in conversations with all of the guests sitting at the bar and they seemed to really enjoy being at work....rare in the service industry.   Definitely check this place out, just don't sit in my seat at the bar.

Ok...I went back after great anticipation.   I still love this place. I had the same wine as last time and I still cannot remember the name of it, but man, it is good (maybe the reason I can't remember the name is because I had too much of it). I went again for happy hour on a Friday, it is dangerous that this place is so close to my work. This time we had to sit at the bar upstairs because the one downstairs was packed. I really love the open kitchen. You can watch them prepare all of your food right there in front of you. Our bartender was awesome, joked around with us, talked wine with my friend who worked at vineyard for years, and gave us some great recommendations for Riojas that he thought we would enjoy. I love service like this, that is why I will keep coming back, people who genuinely like their guests and enjoy their jobs. The awesome food at $5 a plate doesn't hurt either:)

DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG HERE unless you want him to come back cut up and bleeding.  I brought my shih-tzu here to be groomed by Sylvia and when I picked my dog up he was shaking and visibly upset.  When we got home, he wouldn't walk, run, play, or even go to the bathroom or eat and drink.  My dog is two years old, this is very out of character for him.  I knew something was wrong with his back leg because he wouldn't put weight on it, and upon closer inspection I noticed that the entire inside of his leg had been cut up by the clippers.  His skin was raw and bleeding, and there were other spots on his back that looked the same.  I immediately called Petsmart and they told me to come back and they would reimburse me.  I returned the next day and asked that they have their vet check him out as well, because the situation had not improved over night.  They agreed to refund me and have the Banfield vets look at him.  I ran home to get my dog, and brought him back.  When I arrived, I was told I would be next in line, right after the dog in front of me because he was an emergency.  Ok, not a problem.  Then another dog was seen and helped, then another dog, so I finally went up and asked how long I could anticipate to sit there waiting on a Sunday afternoon.  The woman couldn't give me an estimate and told me I would have to wait until all of the appointments were seen first.  I, once again, asked to speak with the manager, who does nothing for managing situations whatsoever, and he told me that because they are a separate business, they couldn't do anything about the wait.  Needless to say, I left.  For $56 + $10 in tip, I can find a groomer who will treat my dog correctly and humanely, and I will not have to worry about them coming home injured.  I will never return to Petsmart for grooming, nor will I set foot in this Petsmart for anything again.  There are quite a few other pet stores and groomers in the area and I'm sure their level of service will exceed Petsmart's lack in customer service tenfold.

Love this place!  The wine selection is awesome and the food is super yummy.  I recommend you order the brushetta sampler, there are so many options and I have tried and love them all.  On Monday's they have half price bottled wine night, excellent for happy hour.  My only complaint is the parking situation, I hate that my only option is valet.  Why can't I just park my own car?  It does get packed in here so come early, it is busy because it is awesome.  One other thing I have noticed and really appreciated is that everyone who works there is guest oriented.  I had a manager opening my wine for me, the hostess told us about the specials, the waiter helped us move from the lounge to the restaurant, it was great.  There was no, "Oh, that's not my job, so and so will be right with you," they take initiative and focus on the guest, something that is lacking in too many places today.  Love it, can't wait to go back.

Did a little bit of day drinking/lounging on the patio here the other day, and I must say...I love this place.  From the cutie pie that served us and his witty personality to the awesome wine and bruschetta, it was perfect.  I would come here everyday if I was a lady who lunched.  But alas, I am not that spoiled, so I will just continue to stop by from time to time and get a little toasty (in more than one way) on their lovely patio.

Again, I love this place.  I am seriously considering moving into this area because of the restaurants and businesses, and Postino is on the list of awesome places I can't get enough of.  I went here on Saturday afternoon with a girlfriend.  I was really hoping to sit on the patio since it was GORGEOUS out, but of course, we waited till absolute prime weekend lunch time and were forced to sit inside.  I make this sound horrible but it isn't at all, I was just being dramatic.  It turned out great because we sat at the bar next to this super cute, chatty couple and talked with the very nice, helpful bartender.  They roll up the garage door windows and open the doors when it is nice, so it was almost (not quite) like we were on the patio.  One plus: no bees inside.    My friend and I decided we would day drink (why not? it is the weekend) so she ordered a mimosa and I a Bellini.  Fresh juice paired with champagne (sparkling wine, prosecco, cava, bubbly, whatever) = delicious.  AND all glasses of wine and beer are only $5 from 11:00am - 5:00pm.  Thank you, may I have another?  After our second adult beverage we ordered olives and brushetta.  Both were delicious and perfect for a light lunch.  I probably could have sat there all day had we not made movie plans.  Probably better that way anyways, I wouldn't want to overstay my welcome (or not be able to drive myself home because of Bellini imbibement).    All in all, another great experience at Postino, maybe I will check out the new one on Central next time....

I went here again tonight, I think I need Postino rehab.  I was with about twenty women from my sorority alumni group; we just met up for some drinks and snacks after work.  Postino knew we were coming and set aside a great little arrangement of couches, tables and chairs for us all.  I had two glasses of wine, Grayson Cabernet (which was really good) and a Reisling (I can't remember which one, but I liked it).  My friend and I also split the selection of four bruschettas.  We had the brie and apple (my favorite), the caprese, goat cheese and roasted red peppers and salami and pesto.  They were all amazingly good!    Simply put though, I love this place because it is consistently good. The service is always great, it is reasonably priced, the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful.  Right now is the perfect time of year for them to roll up their garage doors and let the fresh air in off their patio.  And the dimly lit bar is the perfect place to get a little tipsy on a Tuesday.  ;)  I will continue to go back time after time because I am never let down.  PS:  After reading their menu front to back, even though I have it memorized, I noticed that on Mondays and Tuesdays for $20, you can get a bottle of house wine and a plate of bruschetta.  This is definitely enough for two people to make a meal out of or for three to four to share as an appetizer.  What a great deal!  My only complaint remains their monopoly on parking and the pretty much mandatory valet.  Just let me park my own God damn car!  If you don't mind walking a bit, though, you can skip this part.

Dr. Bracken and his staff are amazing, he is the dog whisperer!  I have been taking both of my dogs here for years, and I love this vet.  They are focused on what is best for my dog, don't recommend things they don't need, and are very reasonable.  They even called to check up on my pup after she had her teeth cleaned.  They are awesome and I recommend them to all of my friends and family who have pets. :)

I have been jumping from nail salon to nail salon and I have yet to find one I truly like.  My friend refered me here and I have to say, I really like it.  I never have to wait, they do a great job on my pedicure and they have the Shelac nail polish that stays on for two weeks without chipping.  Not only do they have it though, they know how to apply it so that it really does stay put.  The staff is friendly, the shop is clean and the prices are very reasonable.  I have definitely found a new nail place.

This place is great if you just want to get drunk and dance...seriously:)   Thursdays are, in my opinion, the best because it is is a slightly younger crowd than who is normally here (apparently old people can't party on a week night), and the drinks are two for one (always nice on my wallet).   They play a wide range of dancing music from Journey to Lil' Wayne, but mostly I just like the overstuffed white couches out on the patio. They are perfect for when your stilettos start to hurt or you have had one to many vodka sodas and need a rest.   The doorman, Vince, is such a sweetie, he always remembers me and I never have to wait in line or show my ID, something I appreciate since I frequent this place. The bartenders are pretty quick too, especially for how crowded it can get.   Usually I just order my usual Ketel One and soda, but I have noticed they have a pretty great looking martini menu as well, how apropos:)

I really like Zinc. The food has been excellent every time I have been here and the service has always been great. This is a great place to go on a Sunday afternoon to sip champagne and people watch.   The decor is awesome, looks very authentic, and they have a great patio that is perfect when the weather is nice.   The prices aren't anything out of the norm for this type of restaurant and considering it is in the middle of Kierland, it is fairly unpretentious, something I love about it.   One thing I have noticed, though, this would not be a vegetarian friendly restaurant. I am a bit of a picky eater when it comes to meat and sometimes I have trouble with the menu. But, that is with all French food, they like their meat. However, the staff has always been very accommodating to my eccentricities:) The onion soup is fabulous, by the way, and my friend loves their mussels, he gets them every time we go.

These guys are great.  My "Low Tire Pressure" light came on, as well as my "Brake Fluid" light so I stopped in to see them. Instead of lying to me or telling me I need something I don't, the super helpful guy put air in my tires, topped off my brake fluid and did a pretty intense visual check on my brakes....all for free. He told me I was good for now, but come back in about two months, I will need new brake pads then.   I cannot tell you how many times car service guys try to take advantage of me because I'm a young girl who doesn't really know about cars. It was so refreshing to have an honest and knowledgeable guy look things over and really help me. He didn't charge me a dime for the courtesy, even though I pretty much insisted on some sort of payment. He just said, "Do me a favor and come back when you need a real service". You bet buddy, I will be back.   I loved the ethical business practices and I now trust these guys to take care of me and my car. Good job, Brake Masters!

As a single girl who knows nothing about cars and HATES going to the dealership (cuz they always rip me off), I take my car here ALL THE TIME.  I love that they don't ever try to screw me; they fix what needs to be fixed and leave the rest alone.  They are honest: they told me I don't need a new air filter...yet, and they are funny and nice.  They even humored me when I stopped in to have air put in my tires....I know, I know, I'm a grown woman, I should know how to do this.  Blah blah blah, the truth is, I know how....I just would rather have someone else do it for me;).  I have been coming here since I got my driver's liscense and will continue to come back because I appreciate not being swindled and taken advantage of and they do a great job for a reasonable price.    Keep it up, guys!

In addition to the name, which I love by the way, I really liked this place.  I went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers.  There were five of us, we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50.  Not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio.  They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare (nothing special, just your typical bar food), and they offer mini pitchers of beer (I love that).  My only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio.  It's just gross.  But, the patio is big enough that we just moved "upwind" from the smokers and we were fine.    This would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks.  I'll be back again.

This is probably my favorite spot in Scottsdale.  Kaz is awesome.  I love that it is hidden and hard to find...only people who know it is there, go in.  They have the most extensive wine list I have ever seen, which at first was intimidating, but ultimately there is something for everyone.  They have bottles ranging from $15 all the way up to $2500, how could you not find something that you like.  In addition, they have a great menu of tapas and plates that are great for sharing.  They continuously update their menu to reflect the seasons, and their wines by the glass change constantly.  I used to go every week and the list was always different.  I usually go on Mondays and Thursdays for the live jazz.  Monday is a woman who sounds like Etta James, she is fabulous, and on Thursday they have a band that is probably the best jazz band I have ever seen.  You can call ahead and reserve a couch which is great for a group, there is a minimum, but it is pretty easy to meet with 3 or more people who are eating and drinking.  I love the darkness, it is very intimate.  It's a great date spot when the music isn't playing, it does get a little loud, but awesome for say a group of four.  The only complaint I have is about the service, sometimes it is a little lacking, but this isn't the type of place you are in any rush to get in and out of, so it's ok.  The atmosphere, wine and food more than make up for it.  My other issue is with the cover charge.  I realize it is because they have live music, but I feel like cover charges are for clubs.  I think they should have a minimum check amount and if you go over it you don't pay cover, otherwise then you pay, just a thought.  Still, not a big enough deal to keep me from coming back week after week.  Peter Kasperki owns Kaz and he has quite a few restaurants, he also owns Cowboy Ciao, Mexican Standoff, Digestif, Sea Saw and has more coming.  I have only been to Cowboy Ciao and Digestif, but I really like both of them as well.  He knows what he's doing.  I have lived in the valley my whole life and I have yet to find a place similar to Kaz, it truly is great, especially in a sea of not so great places in Oldtown Scottsdale.  Oh, and they are open until two, and they serve until two.  No "oh its 1:30 we are shutting down for the night".  They will even let you order food until 1:45, as long as you eat quick;)

The service here is AWFUL!!  I had to just get that out.  I run a university alumni group and we have been going here to watch all of our football games this season.  This mean, every Saturday, 15-30 people show up and bring them business, stay for 3-4 hours, spend money on food and drinks, and we take care of our waitress who usually is Megan (she's awesome, PS).  However, Zipps is unwilling to reserve us any sort of area, give us any sort of drink or food specials and as of last night, they wouldn't even put our game on one of the 20 televisions in the entire bar area until the UofA game was over.  When I asked to talk to the manager, Jeremy, he copped a SERIOUS attitude with me.  He told me they have been more than accommodating to our group and we don't appreciate anything they have done.  He said he would turn our game on once the others were done.  Well, Jeremy and Zipps management/owners, by me having to arrive at your establishment at least two hours early to ensure we have a spot, your staff telling me I cannot sit at a table unless I have a minimum number of people with me, me paying the same price as everyone else for everything on your menu, and then as of last night having your server put our entire group's tab on one person's credit card and telling us we have to wait to watch our game when there are 10+ alumni sitting there waiting; if you think that is ACCOMODATING, you are DELUSIONAL.    Last night was the last straw in putting up with their awful attitudes and service.  Ten minutes into the game, when they finally did put it on the TV, we had already paid our tab and gone next door to O'Clancy's where they had no problem giving us three big tables, drink specials and our game (did I mention it was the home team, ASU game?) on three big screens.  We will be moving our groups' viewing parties to another sports bar from this point forward.  In case you forgot, Zipps, sports bars are a dime a dozen and yours isn't worth ten cents.  I know Zipps' owners have recently fired much of their staff and hired all new management and servers at their Kierland location, I think it is time you reevaluate who you have working for you at your Camelback location.  And, incase you deal with other alumni groups in the future, the two bars I have talked to since last night have been more than willing to reserve an area for us, give our group food and drink specials during our games, and always promise to show our games.  Remember, Zipps and Jeremy, football season may be half way over, but basketball season is just around the corner, and....our team is good, so we like to watch them.  That is 26 games that we will be watching from December to March, not to mention every Saturday from now until December 4 for football.  Man, sucks for you.  I guess your loss is someone else's gain.  Oh, and by the way, I'm a server and have been for almost ten years, so I know what accommodating is, and you are not it.

THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself.   Todd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took "the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I "get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world". Apparently my "myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, "[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it.   I cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.    ***ADDITION 10/19/2010*** I was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.  I was not asking him to "hold" tables for us, I was asking that they take care of  "actual customers".

Love this place!  The food is consistently delicious, the service is always quick and polite, and it is very reasonable.  We come here at least once a week and it is one of my favorites in the Arcadia neighborhood.  There is a reason it has been around for years, it's fantastic! :)

I have been coming here for years and it is, hands down, the best filet in town. I have been to every single great restaurant and steakhouse in Phoenix / Scottsdale, and I still maintain they have the best Medium Rare Filet in all of the city.  The service here is great, the drinks are wonderful, the live music is entertaining, and the food is superb. Bobby's is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Try the Caesar salad, eggplant rollitini, butternut squash ravioli, tiramisu, it's all good!!

Awful!  First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.    I went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.    A woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, "I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.    At this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.    There are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?  Needless to say, the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.  Oh, and the people that go here: I might as well stay up in North Scottsdale, it's the same yuppie, "I'm so important"/30K millionaire crowd that has taken over what used to be the great city of Scottsdale.  It's sad, I really wanted to like this place and it has the potential to be fabulous...if they just start over.  Don't waste your time or your money.

The Root is a great, reasonably priced hair salon in Phoenix. The stylists are extremely well trained and very knowledgeable as to their products and trade. The owner is Lauren Hart and I have been going to her for about 12 years now. Every time I leave her salon my hair looks amazing. She has been doing hair for more than 20 years and you can tell. Lauren and her staff continuously go to classes and hair shows to stay up to date on the latest trends and technologies in hair. Everyone that works there does an amazing job and they are all so friendly and upbeat.   The decor is very minimal and everything is extremely clean. There is really cool artwork everywhere that is all for sale and changes periodically. The salon is really a place you can go relax and enjoy yourself. I recommend this salon to everyone I know because the staff is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. I know how hard it is to find someone to do a great job on my hair and I have been fortunate to find this salon.   If you are new to the area or just need a new stylist, The Root has what you are looking for. They specialize in color correction and they really do have the client's best interest in mind. They also offer some waxing services, deep conditioning, and they carry a wide variety of products.   One tip, call ahead. Because they are so good at what they do, you need to book your appointment in advance, especially if you want to get in with Lauren. Also, they are closed on Sundays.

Great neighborhood bar with good drink specials and friendly staff (especially Angie). Trivia on Wednesdays is always a good time and the pretzel, nachos, and wings are delicious to mention a few.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. When I first saw the address, I was very skeptical. It is in Sunnyslope. I literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on Central and that this place was probably one of them. I'm so glad I had that talk with myself. This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes, small businesses and a school. They have a great atmosphere, the inside has roll-up, garage doors and there is a huge patio.   My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasn't the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didn't try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, it's Monday!?!   Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back.   Good atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices and friendly service.

I have only been here a couple of times but Peter Kasperski has done it again. I always sit at the bar because the first time I went there was late night after I got out of school and the bartender was so friendly and knowledgeable that I continue to sit there. Creature of habit, I am. I have had their BLT several times now because it is really yummy and I'll be honest, I am a pick eater and it is one of the few items on the menu that I won't have to modify at all. My friends, however, are not so picky, and have tried pretty much everything else they have to offer and loved all of it.   I also have to mention that they have a great wine selection (of course, if you know Cowboy Ciao or Kaz, which are owned by the same guy) and their cocktails are good, too.   Mostly the reason I am reviewing this place, though, is because I truly adored our bartender. I cannot remember her name but she was just awesome. She chatted with my friend and I for a great deal of time this last time I was there and we talked about food, wine, etc. I work in the industry and I love to meet others who do too and she was just great. She knew so much about food and wine and I just appreciated her insight.   I cannot wait for Mexican Standoff to open, it is the next restaurant that Peter is opening and from the sounds of it, I will love it.

Ugh...I knew it. I have been avoiding this place like the plague, but I finally caved in and went with a friend who loves it and swears it's awesome. I don't know where else she goes, but man those places must be similar to hell.   We started off in Sushi Roku, just for a drink. Drinks were good, your average $11 Cosmo, nothing spectacular but nothing bad. Staff was pleasant, the girl behind the bar actually acknowledged our existence and chatted with us, something unusual in this area. Next it was over to Shade Lounge, the lounge by the pool.   Disaster. When we first got there it was pretty packed, we didn't have any problem getting in, but then again we are three 24 year old girls dressed to the nines. The cocktail waitress was great, chatty, recommended some great drinks, I can't remember what they were but the one I had was Grey Goose Orange and raspberries...tasty. We took a seat at a table that had a reserved sign on it, but the girl said it was fine, the people weren't arriving until later and she would let us know if we needed to move. Perfect, we were waiting for our group to arrive because we already had a table reserved elsewhere. Things were going great up until what happened next.   Out of nowhere, this big monkey in a suit comes up to us and demands that we move immediately. That's all and well, buddy, but I want my credit card back before I just get up and walk away. The guy continues to tell us we have to move immediately because the group that has reserved the table is waiting....and waiting they were, right behind him, all 9 girls. What happened to giving us some warning. Talk about making your guests uncomfortable. We basically told him we weren't going anywhere until he brought us our check and card. Fine, he says. I'll be right back. Great, minus the 9 girls totally glaring at us, eh, awkward. So he comes back, he can't find our waitress and says, "I have another table for you, come with me, I am comping your drinks." So we decide this will suffice and we go sit at another table.....right next to the one we are already at. Um, call me crazy, but why couldn't he just seat the other group here? Whatever, we say, free drinks and a table, we are fine.   No we are not. Our cocktail waitress comes over with the check. $40 for three drinks. This would be fine and expected at this place, except for the fact that Monkey in a Suit was supposed to comp our drinks. Not waitresses fault, Monkey's fault for not relaying the message. So, we explain the situation and we ask for the manager.  Mr. Manager in a suit who thinks he's the shit because he manages the bar at the W comes over. We retell the events of the evening and the guy literally has the balls to say this to me in his snotty little voice, "Well what do you want me to do about it? I already comped your drinks." Up until this point I wasn't really that pissed, I was just annoyed and wanted to bring it to his attention. What this jack ass doesn't realize is that I work for the only resort in Scottsdale that has managed to earn and maintain for more than 30 years consecutively five diamond and five star status (there are only three resorts in the world that have accomplished this). I'm pissed now. How dare you have the audacity to talk to a guest like this. The proper response would have been to apologize, and ask if there is anything else he may do to make our experience enjoyable, I would have been fine. I then asked him what his name was and who his supervisor was. He gave me his first name, Dominic, and refused to tell me who his supervisor was, he said he was the supervisor. At this point, I said, "Bring me the credit card, don't even think of charging anything to it, and you will be hearing from me, this is completely unacceptable."   I immediately went downstairs to the front desk and spoke with Melvin, who was the most accommodating and friendly person I met in that hotel. Props to Melvin. I told him I was hoping to plan an event for the holidays and asked if he could get me some contact information...sneaky I know, but I wanted to make sure I got accurate info. He proceeded to give me all of the information I needed.   Needless to say, I will not be returning to this place ever again, and I will not be recommending it to anyone.  In fact, I will be telling people exactly what I just wrote here. In addition to the typical wanna-be millionaires and the cougars and bimbos that flock to Old Town and the pretentious attitude that is all too common in these sub-par establishments, this experience pretty much ruined our night. We didn't even stay for our table that our friends had reserved. We headed over to Kazmierz for some wine and great jazz.

I debated between four and five stars....   I have been wanting to check this place out for sports and finally did this past weekend. I went here on Saturday to watch college football and have a few beers with friends. When we got there, the host (possibly the manager, not sure) greeted us immediately. We asked if we could watch the Washington vs. Oregon State game (Go Huskies) and if it would be possible to get a table for six. He took us towards the back of the bar to a huge booth with a giant big screen right next to us. He asked, "Will this work??", well "Hell YEAH this will work! Thank you!" We are off to a good start:)   Our super friendly server listed all of the beers and gave us some pointers on the menu. We got a couple of drinks and then decided to eat something. Let me tell you, they have something for everyone here. They have small bites, appetizers, salads, burgers, steaks, full entrees, and desserts; the selection is huge. We settled on some small bites to share and ordered some more drinks.   All in all, this place was classy yet laid back; something that is rare in Phoenix / Scottsdale when we are talking about sports bars. Zipps is a nightmare and Fox is expensive; Wolfley's fits right into the gap because they're reasonably priced, chill and accommodating AND they have good food to boot.   Oh, and they have a great patio with an indoor/outdoor bar, and I'm pretty sure I spotted Cornhole, YES!  They are a great addition to Desert Ridge and I will definitely be back!

Never again.  My friend bought me a Groupon for a "classic blowout, hair therapy treatment, and a five-minute scalp massage".  When I arrived, I asked for my hair to be styled with big waves which the stylist said would take too long since she would need to blowdry it and then style it. So, I was given the option to have my hair either dry styled or shampooed and blowdryed but not styled. Well, since I wanted the hair therapy and scalp massage, I opted for the blowdry.  What a waste of time. There was no massage, it was the fastest, most rushed shampoo I have ever had, and I didn't get my hair treatment. Then, she blowdryed my hair as promised, but that was literally it. Normally this would include a round brush or paddle brush to at least make it straight and styled. Nope, it wasn't even dry. She kept asking me to run my hands through my hair to make sure it was dry - I guess she couldn't tell on her own. And she declared me finished with still damp, still wavy, and unstyled hair.  Then came the kicker. I hand my card over to pay and the receptionist (a man but I forget his name) informed me that they would be adding gratuity and told me how much I was to pay! I am a great tipper, I will always fork over 25-30% for a good blowout because I have a lot of long, thick hair, but this girl didn't deserve a tip at all, let alone the 20% that was DEMANDED from me.  I called several times to complain, the manager called me back and left a message, I called her back and left a message, then I never heard from them again.  Terrible service, terrible customer service, and with so many options and competition, I will be going elsewhere - like Drybar - from now on.

If I could give them less stars, I would.  We arrived to the festival at about 5:00pm with tickets to the tequila tent.  The tent was shut down, most of the booths were sold out of tacos and we basically left after about thirty minutes.  I have contacted this company three times to get a refund because I didn't get to use my tequila passes and I don't think it is right that I paid entrance for an event that was practically sold out (Hello, stop letting people in if you know that there is no food left.)  I have yet to get a response, so I am hoping this will garner some sort of reply to my request.    The level of customer service exhibited by the people that put this on is AWFUL. If this issue is not resolved, I, and my group of friends, will not be returning in the future.

Not impressed. My stylist did an OK job in drying and styling my hair, but having to listen to her belt out Mariah Carey for the first half of my appointment and then listen to her and another stylist rap obscenities along to a radio station that I'm almost positive is not on the approved playlist, I will go elsewhere.  I'm here to relax, not listen to you audition for American Idol.

OMG this place is amazing!  Get the trifecta three with crab and shrimp. Be sure to get extra bread and just get down on that food! It is soooo good, the service is good, the price is so reasonable for fresh seafood, and you will leave craving it again and again.  I'm so glad this place opened right by my house!!

Four stars for location and ambience, 1 star for their prices. $5.50 for a latte with honey is absurd. Not when there are so many other coffee shops in the neighborhood. I wanted to like this place but not at that price.
