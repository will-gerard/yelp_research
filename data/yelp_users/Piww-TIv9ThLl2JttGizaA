While their happy hour is good ($5 wines by the glass) , and the food is passable, I was absolutely perplexed when they could not tell me the price of a bottle of a split of champange in their prominently displayed behind bar wine cooler. When I inquired with the manager he strangely acted like I was in his house saying "did you ever think that there may be a reason it's not on the menu? Maybe it's part of a personal collection!" It seemed odd, and completely devoid of any hospitality. I probably won't be back any time soon.

My engagement ring is BEAUTIFUL. Danielle was a dream to work with. If you go in definitely ask for her. The quality, as far as I'm concerned, cannot be matched. I love that each piece is an original, and that nobody else has a ring that looks like mine. I get so many compliments on my engagement ring. I'm about ready to go in and have another check up on the setting and to pick out my wedding band, and I can't wait. They sell Rolex also, which is a pretty sweet plus.

Trash. The manager is spiteful and rude. Would rather see a table sit empty rather than seat it with a table of girls. Felt like we wouldn't be worthy of a table, even though I have money to spend here for a bachelorette extravaganza. Too bad. I'll never be back. Managment is horrible and would prefer to see an empty restaurant that a table of girls.

Tried to get a table. On a Wednesday had a ridiculous wait because they wouldn't seat a table of two at a table for four. (75 minutes with tables for 3-4 sitting open!!!!) it's summer in phoenix! What are they waiting for to put butts in their seats. No matter. I left and went to Stingray who got me in with no incident at 7pm.

I would not recommend this salon at all. I booked my first appointment, arrived on time and went through the store with the sales person. Emily helped me pick out dresses to try on. Some of them were sample dresses which would have really saved me some money. I tried on about twelve dresses, some yes and some nos. it was like pulling teeth to get dresses that were what I asked for. I wanted simple, no bling, but many of the dresses she brought I looked at and just said no and tried to explain again what I wanted. After that, she started putting the screws to me to put one of the dresses on hold with a $250 deposit. I finally caved and put a deposit on a dress which ended up to be a no, with the understanding that we could move the money to a dress of my choice from the upcoming Allure Bridal trunk show. I was also promised that there would be two specific dresses that they didn't have in stock that day but that I really wanted to try on.   Jump cut to my trunk show appointment. None of the dresses I wanted, that I was promised were there. I had my bridesmaid come out from Las Vegas to see the trunk show items that turned out not to be there. When my appointment was confirmed I asked how many styles had come in for the trunk show. They said they had lots. Turns out they brought in about eight styles on a tiny rack in the main room. What a waste.   I was so angry. After some negotiation I was refunded my deposit. I'm so disappointed in my experience and in the customer service in general. Also, in the selection and their listening to what I wanted defiantly require some improvement.

Good experience my first time here. Good thorough car wash. My car was shiny in and out. No water spots. It took a little longer than I would have liked for them to greet me and take my keys, but outside of that the experience was good. The lady at the counter was engaging and polite. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. I'll be back for sure.

I have continued to frequent Francis and sons since I wrote my first review. Did you know that if you buy 5 you get the sixth free? Also. Punch cars for a freebie every 10th. Always happy with the quality and service.   Good experience my first time here. Good thorough car wash. My car was shiny in and out. No water spots. It took a little longer than I would have liked for them to greet me and take my keys, but outside of that the experience was good. The lady at the counter was engaging and polite.

I really love this salon. I have been coming here for 3 years now. Lee or Michelle are my favorite techs. They usually have my color waiting for me when I come in. They always know exactly what I like and do a great job. Always super thorough. I highly recommend this salon.

I was not impressed at all with this salon. When I walked in I walked to the desk and let them know that I had an appointment. The woman at the desk was nice enough. I signed in and filled out a short questionnaire and then she pointed me in the direction of the dresses to help myself. Without asking me what I was looking for, what I liked from other salons, or specific designers that I wanted to see, she sent me on my way to pick out dresses. All of the dresses were in plastic, so it was next to impossible to ascertain what style each dress was. Every other salon has offered me heels and foundation garments to try on with dresses, as they make everything look lovely and it can make the difference between a serious maybe and a absolute no. The attendant was not helpful in helping me into and out of dresses, and tried to tell me that the dresses are of superior quality, so they will not require corsets or slips (HA! No one is that perfect!). Many of the dresses looked old. A few that were pulled for me were seriously damaged or torn or had staining in questionable areas (underarms, lining, gross). Just not really a professional feeling to the experience. It's not worth the savings to have a dress that is several seasons old and already dirty or damaged.

Had a great time here. I have been a couple of times. Once with my mom and her dog, and another time with my fianc√© and friends. Had a great time each time. The green chile dip is delightful. Beer selection is good too. They have a lot of selection, not only from their own menu, but from breweries all over the west. The patio is absolutely the spot to be if it is not too hot out. On the weekend the vibe is chill with dogs and owners all over. We live in Chandler, so it is a little out of the way, but worth it for a good Saturday beer and burger.

Worst manicure of my life. Rushed and completely dry. The technician totally botched my cuticles to the point where I told her to stop in the middle of the manicure. I will have to go to a different salon to have them salvaged. Ugh. Never again.

I didn't end up purchasing my dress here, but the service was great. They offered me a slip and bustier to try on with the dresses. They helped me get into and out of the dresses. They listened to what I asked for and helped me select a number of dresses. I liked the salon, the knowledgeable staff, and for the most part the styles. There are not a lot of choices on colors, ultimately making the choice against the dresses that were maybes from there, but the experience was great.

This was the best bridal gown shopping experience that I have had. Kasey put me at ease, listened to what I wanted, also to what I didn't like from my previous experiences. I was supremely discouraged when I got there because I had had some terrible experiences at other salons. When we got there Kasey greeted us, showed us around, and got a feel for what I had in mind. She helped me pick about 10 dresses. She is expert in getting the dresses on in a flash. She asked me if I liked them, if it was a no, or I didn't like it as much as another style she would take it out of the room. There were three strong maybes. We finally found the dress, and it was in my price range once she negotiated with her manager (no stress on my part!). There was never any stress or pressure. Just encouragement and expertise.   I couldn't be happier. I finally have my dress after 5 salons and over 50 dresses tried on. I was in great hands with Kasey at the helm of my experience. I would HIGHLY recommend this bridal salon.
