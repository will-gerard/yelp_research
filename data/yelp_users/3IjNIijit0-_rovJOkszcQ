Great, authentic Thai food in the heart of Phoenix. They are always packed which is a true testament to their food! The service is always exceptional as well. The only downside is DDD was just there last week so expect a much longer wait once the episode airs!

Cash or debit only. Best prices in town. They make dry cleaning so affordable. I've been coming here for three years and will continue to do so. The majority of my work clothes are dry clean only and I've never had an item lost or damaged. If you bring a stain to their attention they are usually able to remove it. Just like any laundered item, not EVERY set in stain is removable (i.e. You spill Clorox on your dress... Just throw it out). I'm not sure why some people are complaining. Out of the dozen or so dry cleaners I've used, Seville has always been friendly, fast (same day service) and efficient. Thank you for raising the bar on dry cleaning.

Another great Yelp find! They are a step up from the Outback type restaurants with the delicious food of a more pricier steakhouse without the pretension. Everything we ordered was fantastic. Their steaks were done perfectly (not something many restaurants do well) and their garlic mashed potatoes were phenomenal. Make sure to try their baked potato soup... It's to die for!

I agree with a fellow yelper that the quality has gone down slightly in the past few years. Coming from a family of European immigrants, I would also agree that their bread needs work. Other than that, the sandwiches and salads are delicious and I will continue returning! Don't come here if you're on a diet. :)

We stopped here on the way to San Diego based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely worth it! This is a great place to go if you want a delicious and quick meal in lieu of a fast food stop. The food was fresh, authentic and very affordable. We will be coming back next time we are in the area!

Island Time is an amazing company. They have top notch customer service and are reliable. When I was looking at hiring pool companies I found them through Yelp and the owner was actually the one who came out to do the initial assessment! He was knowledgeable, courteous and extremely professional. Since hiring them last year, I've referred three other families to them all who feel the exact same way. An added bonus is they have an online bill pay system for those who use them as a monthly service. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my pool needs!

This is the only place that if zero stars were available, they would get it. AFTER moving out of the house he put this service in my name. We weren't even married at the time! I came home one day to see two men just wondering my backyard. Nothing was done! I called to complain and inquire to what was going on. I then received an invoice in the mail with my name on it, again, on a service I never asked for. After repeated messages, changing the locks to my backyard and demanding service be cancelled they threatened to send me to collections for the $100ish charge. Long story short, if you're looking to do business with a corrupt, incompetent business then this place is for you! They are a joke.

I came across this restaurant while running errands one day. Their service is top notch and the sandwich I ordered was perfect and filling for the price. A must try if you are looking for a quick bite in the Kierland area!

This restaurant has an identity crisis. Is it a sports bar? Is it a sushi restaurant? I don't think the owners even know. The bill was pricy for what we got. Happy hour specials were mediocre compared to neighboring sushi restaurants. Service and quality of food were sub par. We definitely won't return.

Good nail salons are like hair salons... Once you find a good one, you drive out of your way to continue going. Shea Nails is the best nail salon I've found in the area (quality, affordability and most importantly sanitarily.). I've gone in places in the area and if they don't clean their tools or the place is unkept cleanliness wise, I won't get any services done. I've had too many friends get fungus from dodgy nail salons... This one is definitely trustworthy. The staff over the past three years has always been great and there is a wide variety of pedicure services from a simple polish change to the super deluxe which includes callus remover and a paraffin wax for your feet! I won't go anywhere else.

I posted an updated review due to one poor manicure by a newer manicurist, as I've been a frequent customer for years, and changed my rating today to a higher rating. This is due to the quick response from the owners to do what they can to correct it. I am a loyal customer and this is further proof why. They expect quality like their clients. One manicure up to my liking in 5 years is a good track record, especially after hearing from a friend that a salon down the street had given her poor service AND nail fungus. No thanks!  Please do note that this salon has experienced larger wait volumes lately (especially on weekends) so I do highly recommend calling ahead for appointments.

I've been coming here for three years now based on yelp reviews. Threading isn't as popular in Arizona as it is in other regions in the U.S.  After being introduced to threading in Chicago, I won't ever go back to waxing. Tori is the one I go to and hands down one of the best! If you're looking for affordability and more important reliability, this is the place!

Very clean bowling alley that accommodates people ranging from families with small children to those looking to drink and have a good time. The only downfall is downtown parking but don't go to a downtown spot if paid parking is an issue for you!

Wow! What an amazing place and find. We are in the area frequently and didn't even know this place was here. The service was perfect and pleasant. We all tried each other's plates and everyone's dish was top notch and melt in your mouth pairings of flavor. We definitely will be back! Their only downside is they are open just for dinner.

If you're a fan of Fox restaurant concepts and the Culinary Dropout, then this place is for you! I've never had a bad dish here. Their soups, salads and entrees are all spectacular. All of the flavors of their dishes are married beautifully and every bite you take will dance in your mouth. Pure happiness! You won't go wrong with any of their signature drinks. Their only downfall is there is always a long wait so make sure you plan accordingly especially during large downtown events.

Not worth the hype. After growing up in Chicago, I'm used to good pizza. The service is ok. The crust is so charred expect a nasty after taste for hours. Pizza is by no means health food but this one has oil dripping off of every slice. If you want to wait  for over hyped pizza then this place is for you. The only thing worthy of above average ratings is their shabby chic decor

The chips and black bean salsa that are complimentary are amazing. We ordered the SOL guacamole. It has a perfect blend of goat cheese and mango added. Simply delicious and well balanced flavors. I ordered a jalapeño margarita which was average (same as you'll taste in any AZ restaurant). We choose a la cart tacos. Here is where extra stars come in. I like hot food. Ghost pepper hot and the hottest wings never phase me. Then comes their viper taco... Great blend of flavors and a sauce so hot no amount of water will chill the heat. A+

Attention all meat eaters! This place is phenomenal. We've been here half a dozen times since it opened. We haven't had anything bad. Excellent service. Finger licking food. Best brats in Arizona. We can't wait for it to cool off and sit on their extensive patio! A+

If I could give this place zero stars I would. My husband and are American and know more about Japan, pronunciations and food than the staff and owner. The tea my husband ordered was made in a coffee maker. Don't believe me? Try it and find out. My water had floating lettuce in it so I got a hot tea because at least that was boiled.   The miso soup is boiled water with zero flavor. I'm not sure what the gyoza was made out of. The seaweed for the sushi was chewy. The sushi is questionable. Outside of the bad drinks, the brown edamame should've given this place away. The only solace was the elderly couple that was eating at the bar. It looks like they were here before and survived. This gives me hope considering their immune systems are weaker than mine and they're still alive.   My husband tipped the waiter. He figured he needed more money for cigarettes. At least there's a chick fil a close by to get this taste out of our mouths.

Amazing. Just as great as my frequent trips to their main restaurants minus my jalapeño margarita (not served in their airport location).

This is one of the best burger joints in Phoenix. Everything is local/natural. Their burgers range from rare and perfectly seasoned Ahi to a more traditional mushroom Swiss to the spicy side with poblano peppers. The burgers are fantastic and their shakes are a must as well. Try the Nutella pretzel shake and you won't leave disappointed!

If you're looking for a Chicago suburban banquet hall turned restaurant... This is your place! When you walk into a restaurant and the staff out numbers the patrons 2:1 you know there's a problem! They have a nice outdoor setup but if you don't go to dinner there quick, you may not get a chance to. I'm surprised they haven't closed their doors already and give this place only a few more months on life support. The food is moderately priced given the area but it's nothing to write home about. Their hummus is homemade and something you come to expect from traditional Mediterranean establishments. We ordered scallops which at some point may've tasted good. They were sautéed and seasoned on the outside but cold on the inside. I didn't think restaurants microwaved scallops... Maybe they do? The service was so-so and the only other table in the restaurant that was occupied was next to us and had their own waiter who neglected to serve them for over 15 minutes. All in all, this isn't what I would expect for the price, service or quality of food.

I went here for a work function and will definitely be back. Warning to the serious golfers out there, this place may not be for you :). It's a fun atmosphere whether you're going on a date or family adventure. The food is great. The only downside is parking can be difficult given how busy they are even on workdays!

Best brunch in town for the quality, service and prices! Their mimosas are champagne with a slight touch of orange juice in a wine size glass! Another plus is you can bring man's best friend to join in the dining experience. A definite weekly must if you're a local.

We frequently drive by this new trendy restaurant on Scottsdale Rd. We decided to give it a try at lunch. The food was delicious and I would highly recommend the shrimp avocado salad. The ambiance and decor is similar to other restaurants you'll find in Scottsdale. The only reason they don't get 6 stars is due to the service... Our waitress was great, just the time it takes to get your food is longer than you'd like for lunch. We'll definitely be back!

Great service and amazing bbq. We just got back from Texas so that is a huge compliment. We will typically drive to Texas BBQ past downtown from this area for good bbq. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we shared the chicken/ribs and shrimp (the shrimp is an appetizer). It's unfortunate that a few other yelpers had unfortunate experiences following their opening. It seems like all the kinks were worked out... Everything was top notch. The ambiance was great with modern country music. The server and hosts were attentive and friendly. Nobody was wearing anything revealing so my husband and I were shocked at the review one helper had on revealing clothing. It almost seems like the two negative reviewers were at a different restaurant. The sides we had were cole slaw and Mac and cheese. Both were some of the best you'll get in Phoenix. The meat was perfectly BBQ'd and sauce was super tasty. The slaw is some of the best I've had in the country. Their ribs one deserve 5 stars. They are beef ribs. For the real BBQ lovers out there, you know most restaurants choose pork because it is so much easier to cook those tender. This is the ONLY AZ restaurant I've found with amazing beef ribs. Everyone else pales in comparison. The two downsides were that we found they have live country music Weds through Sun and we weren't here for it :) and that the sauce is so great that you need to go to the bathroom to wash your hands... That is a good sign for all of y'all looking for real BBQ. Perhaps wet naps are the next addition to the menu. We will DEFINITELY be back! Thank you!!
