One of my favorite places to go for date night. The food is incredible; can't find anything like it anywhere else. Service experience is unique and very fun. Lou, head of customer service, is always on hand to make sure each guest is having a great dinner. Will continue to be a customer! I would highly recommend everyone try this place for a fun date at least once!

Come here twice and once they've only had one belt running so they had to turn us away. This time their credit card system was down. Not coming back to try a third time.

I probably come here three times a week. The environment and staff are super welcoming and the smoothie options are great! I don't think I've had the same one twice yet. Very happy Blend customer!

This place was great! First time here, and definitely coming back. The fruit was fresh, fondue was great, and the owners are super welcoming. Definitely check ELF out - so worth it
