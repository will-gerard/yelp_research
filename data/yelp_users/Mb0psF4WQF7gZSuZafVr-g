We had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone I saw this one.  On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.  The place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.  On to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.  I wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my "regular" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.  I hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas).

Visited again recently.  This time I had the beef burrito.  Oh...my...god...it was GOOD!  Very good seasoning, Unlike my chicken chimi last time, no need to add anything to the beef burrito!  Also ordered was a pork (carnitas) burrito.  Use the green salsa from the salsa bar and it becomes really good too!  And we took tamales home.  Can you guess?  Yeah...they were really good!!  It's almost enough to make me wish I lived downtown.

This is a nice theater.  Alas our show was not in the Cine Capris theater.  But their regular theater was nice.  There was plenty of leg-room, so when people needed to get by I didn't even have to stand up.  THAT was nice.  I could stretch out a little and not kick the folks in front of me.  Even better than most other Harkins theaters.  The sound was adequate (typical of a Harkins), and the screen was pretty standard.  A bit small, but that is the standard now.  Typical concession stand with typical outrageous prices.  They do offer "seasoning" for the popcorn so you can make it like kettle corn, or some other choices.  A very nice touch.  Employees were nice, and very casual.  Some places it almost seems like the employees are just looking for some infraction of some rule.  Not here.  Just decent customer service.

First visit here.  We bought a few different items.  I was very impressed with their spelt and 9-grain breads.  Very good.  One of the better bakeries I've discovered so far.

We had passes for a screening of "The Internship".  This was our first time here.  But it was not our first screening.  So we had definite expectations about how the screening would be handled.  They didn't seem to be well-organized at managing the screening line, nor the "VIP" screening folks.  It was not quite a mosh-pit, but it wasn't orderly either.  The theater itself was small.  The screen wasn't impressive.  The sound wasn't impressive.  It wasn't horrible, but not as good as other theaters I've been to.    The one really positive thing was the seating.  The seats were comfortable, and there was noticeably more leg room here than any other theater I've been to.  The space between rows clearly is significantly larger.  People can walk by you and you don't even have to move.  I wish all theaters had that much separation between rows.  It was great.  I didn't get any snacks so can't comment on the concession stand.

For those who don't know, Trader Joe's is a sort of up-scale market.  Their selection is less than one of the big groceries like Fry's, but what they do have tends to be organic, and often rather unique.  Their produce is generally 'clean', as are their meats and dairy.  They carry uncured bacon, not-from-concentrate juices, natural grain breads, and some gourmet frozen foods too.  Among other things.  The staff is friendly and helpful, too.  Of course you pay for this level of quality.  But given that this is stuff you're putting into your body, I think it's worth it.  If it were more convenient to my house I'd come here more.  Good stuff.

It feels weird being a "fan" of a colorectal doctor.  ;-)  As near as I can tell this is just Dr Venkatesh.  I've never seen anyone else here, or at least not in a long time (he had a lady doctor there many years ago, but I don't see her now).  Dr Venkatesh came highly recommended when I first saw him many years ago, and I have found him to be thorough and gentle.  (And "gentle" is very important here!!)  The wait this time was a bit longer than usual, but when he came in we discussed the problem and then he got out his scope and checked it out.  His assistants are all female, which might bother some people.  I really didn't care.  I'm just another "face" in the crowd to her, I'm sure!  :-)  I would recommend Dr Venkatesh for all your colorectal needs.  He often is one of the "top docs" in that annual ranking published by one of the local magazines.

This is a nice little produce market.  He buys mostly from local farmers.  The pre-made items (like tortillas, salsas, etc) are from local companies.  Produce varies.  One of the few places you can find okra during okra season, and it usually doesn't have the brown spots you find on the stuff in the bigger stores (on those occasions when they even have it).  They are a bit pricey.  But the produce is generally very fresh (helps when it isn't shipped from South America!).  This is a family business.  The owner and his daughter are there most of the time.

Somewhat difficult to review this one because they didn't actually do anything.  I was having a problem with a lock.  The lock maker actually sent me parts to be used to repair it.  But, while I could get the lock out of the door, I couldn't take it apart.  These guys said I could bring it to them, so I did.  Of course when I bring it to them it works fine.  So they send me on my way with no charge.  I have put the lock back, and it's still not quite right, but it is better.  No idea why.  However, I have to give these guys a good rating for customer service.  They were going to fix the lock with the parts I brought with me, and when they found no problem they didn't even charge me a diagnostic fee.  I like that.  If this thing acts up again I will be trying these guys first.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is because the first guy didn't seem to know anything about an Emtek lock, and after several minutes of not getting anywhere with it he took it to another guy in the back who seemed to know them.

This one is in Chandler mall.  Second floor above Wildflower Bakery.  One very nice thing about Lenscrafters is that they will adjust your glasses for you free.  Their frame selection is a little limited, but they do have some nice choices.  They accept several different insurances, or if you don't have insurance you can use AAA.  Plus they have specials from time to time.  And they do stand behind their work.  If you have a problem within the first few weeks (90 days, I think), they will make it right.  Even if that means new lenses.  We usually come here for our glasses.

It's Denny's.  Basic American food and reasonable prices.  We did not try a "slam" here, so I can't comment on that (unlike my other Denny's reviews).  Service was adequate.  Food was adequate.  Nothing special.  We specifically went for the Lord of the Rings menu because we had sampled that on a recent birthday, and wanted to try other items (plus had a coupon).  My wife had a Shire skillet, and I had the Ring burger.  As I already said, not bad but nothing special.

Dr Susan Pardee.  She was originally recommended to us by my wife's primary physician.  Dr Pardee is nice, but professional.  Don't expect much chit-chat, but she doesn't leave as long as you are asking questions.  She's good at explaining things, and also does her own minor surgeries.  I can definitely recommend her for any dermatological problems.  My entire family goes to her whenever we have concerns.

Dr Bernard is one of the few Gonstead practitioners in the valley.  He doesn't really advertise it that I noticed, but if you ask they will tell you.  I have had several chiropractors over the years, and the one who consistently helped me was Gonstead.  But she is so far from where we live now.  So we decided to try Dr Bernard.  He has adapted his approach a bit compared to my previous chiropractor, but after several visits I can say his work has helped with problems.  He is effective.  Another nice thing is he is on my insurance.  That's a nice bonus!  This has become the tie-breaker between him and another one I found recently who doesn't take our insurance.  If you have pain (back, neck) Dr Bernard can probably fix it for you.

It was our anniversary.  So I open up YELP and start looking for something different, something good.  I spotted this near our office.  Good reviews, never been here...let's go!  The atmosphere is very nice.  A touch of class to it.  The menu was a simple over-sized heavy paper.  Lots of interesting dishes listed.  The waiter recommended a few, and we ended up going with two of his suggestions.  First was the ziti and chicken.  It came in a white sauce with pesto.  (A lot of their dishes have pesto, which may be why they named the restaurant "Pesto's"!)  It was very tasty, and the portion was quite reasonable.  Something different from a lot of Italian restaurants (and vastly better than most of the chains like Olive Garden).  The other dish was their Italian burger.  It was BIG.  And surprisingly good.  Very nice seasoning and toppings.  Not an ordinary burger!  Our waiter was two for two.  We had a very nice anniversary lunch.  I think it safe to say we'll be coming back.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants something different than typical Italian fare (though they did have a lasagna I was tempted to try...maybe next time!).

It's Subway.  Maybe it's just me, but they don't seem as good as they used to be.  They barely put any marinara on their chicken marinara, and the bread seems to turn into a doughy mess after just a few minutes.  It looks OK when they cut it and put the stuff on it, but just in the time it took to get to the table it had collapsed from a full, airy bread to a wad of dough.  I'm not sure the toasting helped at all.  As restaurants go, they suck.  As sub shops go, they are really below average.  I'd go here before going to McDonald's or Burger King.  But that's about all I can say.  If you have other options, I suggest taking them.  If not, it beats McYucks.

Not much to say about this.  Typical Starbuck's beverages (you either like their coffee and other beverages, or you don't), a few munchies (not many).  But the staff was very friendly and efficient, and the little patio outside is nice.  Convenient location.

This is probably the best oriental market in the city.  The next best one I can think of is in LA.  They have a wide variety of products from all over the world, featuring nearly every culture on the planet.  Indian, Indonesian, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese...they seem to have it all.  It's about the only place to get many fresh produce items.  Want some durian?  They have it.  They also have a large variety of seafood and meats.  Including cuts and pieces you won't find in most American groceries.  And let us not forget their international beers aisle.  Not a BevMo or Total Wine, to be sure, but a large variety nonetheless.  If you are cooking authentic Thai or Filipino or other ethnic food, this is the place to come to get your ingredients.  And you'll get used to the smell (mostly from their live fish tanks, as near as I can tell - oh yeah, they have live fish you can buy) within a few minutes of entering.

I first became aware of Dunn-Edwards paints when our first home was being built.  The reputation was that the paint was consistent in color, covered well, and lasted long.  That seemed to be the case, so when we built our new home we had the painter use the same paint.  It turned out that was his preferred brand anyway.  And it has held up well.  Since then we've repainted one room (for color change) and came here to do it.  Now we're looking to repaint the garage, so we came here to get color samples.  We will be buying their paint again for this project.  Pricing is comparable to (or better than) the higher-quality paints carried by the big box stores, and vastly better than their base-line stuff.

We had breakfast here. I had the country fried steak, my wife had the crab cake florentine. Both were very good. Plus they included muffins. The chocolate mousse muffin was wonderful, too.  Other items on the menu included eggs benedict, and a few kinds of quiche.  Service could have been more attentive, but it was adequate.  The manager let us use two coupons (there were four of us) rather than having to sit at separate tables.  That's good customer service.  We did not eat lunch this time, but I did look at the lunch menu.  It had a variety of dishes available from simple stuff like a burger, salads, and au jus, to "fancier" dishes like quiche and pot pie, and salmon and parmesan chicken.  It's not a high-end bistro, but for what it is it is good.  Although the setting is casual, their menu is more extensive than similar places with some different dishes one normally doesn't find.  I anticipate we'll be returning to try more of their dishes.  And definitely buy some of those chocolate mousse muffins!!

We had dinner this time.  A wide variety of dishes.  I had beef bourguignon, the others had chicken dishes.  One opted for the 3-course meal.  The food was good.  My only complaint would be that the beef was too fatty.  But they gave me so much of it that I ended up with enough beef to satisfy my personal portion requirements.  The others seemed to enjoy their chicken dishes (one was the brie chicken, I forget what the other was).  We also had a coupon for free muffins with minimum purchase.  Their email club is pretty good.  We regularly receive coupons, and they are decent coupons.  We will continue patronizing Mimi's.  No, it's not the Cordon Bleu (I imagine...never been there), but it's good stuff.

Spotted them on YELP looking for a sushi place.  Good reviews, so here we are!  First impression...Reggae??  Playing reggae in a Japanese restaurant?  That's odd.  Pretty typical menu for a Japanese restaurant.  I had curry, daughter had sushi.  Both were very good.  A tad pricey, but some of the better Japanese food and sushi I've had in a while.  Service was adequate.  I will be back.

I've eaten at Applebees on rare occasion.  It has never been any place I sought out.  In this case they had the advantage that they were not a McDonald's or Burger King, and they were open very late.  I had the 7oz sirloin. It was adequate. Nothing special.  A little dry, and a bit gristley.  The mashed potatoes were nice, and the garlic broccoli was fine.  The onion rings were fine.  Nothing special.  The breading was nice, but didn't have much flavor.  The others seemed to like their wings and the pasta dish they had.  I was told "three stars" when I asked about them.  But I just can't go to three stars on this one.  You might argue me up to 2.5 stars, but that's not an option on Yelp.  My wife did say the strawberry margarita was good (I didn't drink it).  If you have no choice, this place is OK.  Food is adequate, they have a happy hour, and they are open very late.  One of the better "last resort" options around midnight.

Needed something laminated and they did it fast. Came out well, too.  It's an interesting fusion of a FedEx office and a Kinkos (which no longer exists).  I can see coming back here for printing, laminating, and of course shipping.

This is a chain.  Not a huge chain, but they have several locations nationwide.  I've been moving more towards smaller restaurants, family-owned, one-of-a-kind.  But this is one exception I make.  I've reviewed them before.  They are sort of an Asian/American fusion place.  They also have jambalaya and sushi..  It's hard to nail-down the cuisine.  But it is good food.  On this occasion I had the basil pesto linguine.  It was very nice.  I have since returned and ordered it again.  Though I've tried several other dishes, and they mostly are pretty good.  See my previous reviews.  They continue to be a bit pricey, though I feel a bit better about visiting them right now because they had a gift card offer (buy $100 get $25 free now, and another $25 after Jan 1).  That reduces the effective price by 33%.  Their menu is really good at that pricing!   :-)  Service was outstanding (both this visit and the subsequent visit).  Food still very good.  I'm giving four stars this time.  That might be a little generous, but they are better than three stars (which I've rated in the past), and the gift card deal has addressed my complaint about pricey-ness.  Overall, a solid dining experience.  Good food, good service.

It's Red Robin.  A burger joint.  With endless fries.  I like their burgers.  They taste fresh (because they are), and you can have them however you want.  They have numerous specialty burgers too.  The fries are ordinary.  But they have a shaker bottle of seasoning on the table that really helps them.  They are hot and fresh, but not seasoned.  Their shakes are pretty good, and they give you a lot (the glass, plus any extra in the metal mixing cup).  This is one of my preferred burger places (when I go out for a burger, which isn't really that often).

Time to update my review, it seems.  We found ourselves here for dinner because we had an appointment in the area.  Not much has changed, really.  It's Red Robin.  A burger joint.  Their burgers are pretty good and the endless fries are nice too.  At dinner time the place is LOUD.  Much worse than I recall for lunch.  Maybe the kids?  It was a pretty full house.  I had the peppercorn burger, the wife had a chicken salad.  The chicken was odd.  Unexpected texture.  They took care of it in a timely fashion.  My burger was pretty good.  Really probably 3.5 stars, but for a burger place they are pretty consistent and good.  So I don't want to round down.  Due to time constraints we had to eat and run.  I think service was reasonably quick, especially given how busy they were.

As the name implies, Wildflower makes bread.  They have a fairly wide variety of breads available.  You can buy just the bread if you want, but they serve actual food too.  Their food is sandwiches (hot or cold), soups, and salads.  We were in the mall on an errand and stopped here on impulse.  There was a line, but they seemed to take the orders pretty quickly.  The cashier was friendly and helpful.  I ordered a soup in a sourdough bread bowl.  My wife ordered a soup and half sandwich.  Service was very slow for just soup and sandwich.  Really slow.  Probably about 30 minutes to get the food.  Frankly, it was ridiculous.  If they were cooking the meal from scratch it might make sense, but just ladling out some soup and assembling a sandwich should take 10 minutes...tops.  There really is no excuse for nearly half an hour for such a simple order.  Finally the food arrived.  First...where is the bread?  They had to hollow-out a sourdough bread loaf to put the soup in.  Where's the bread?  I've had this style of soup service before, and they usually put the chunk of bread they removed on the side.  I would have liked to have it.  It would have made the meal a bit more filling.  Without it the meal felt "small".    The soup itself was tomato garlic.  It was very good.  The bread bowl also was good (it really would have been nice to have that good bread they removed from it!!).  My wife also enjoyed her minestrone and sandwich.  I tried her minestrone, and it was very good.  Had the service been faster, and I had been given the bread (which I'm sure they just threw away...wasteful buggers), I'd rate this three stars.  Maybe 3.5.  The food was very good.  Not 'fabulous', but very good.  However, the time to get a simple order of soup and sandwich is simply unreasonable and they must receive a deduction in rating for that alone.  Not giving me the bread also is really stupid.  It costs them nothing, and would have been a "class" move, in my opinion.

Normally I don't write an update so soon after doing a review.  But I did have to comment about something.  We went back here to try them again.  They weren't as busy as last time, so that may have been a factor, but the wait time for our food today was MUCH less than last time.  It was definitely reasonable this time.  The quality of the food was about the same as last time (which was "good"), so give them a third star.  "But you show four stars now", you say.  Yes, I do.  Because of something I noticed this time.  One of the items I ordered was the soup in a bread bowl (again).  This time it came with the inside bread on the side, and the "cap" they cut out of the top to hollow out the bread.  Someone in management was listening here on Yelp!!  I gotta give bonus points for that (i.e. for the bread, and for management listening).  It is rare that management even pays attention to reviews like this (or so it seems), and even more rare that they do something about it.  Kudos to Wildflower for listening and caring!

Had a strange problem with one of my lenses.  It took a while to figure out that's what it was.  At first I thought it was my meter.  Once I figured it out I contacted Nikon and they said to send the lens here.  How fortunate I live and work within driving distance!  No need to ship it!  :-)  So I drop my lens off, describe the problem, get my claim check.  About two days later I receive an estimate in my email.  It was actually less than I feared!  So I call them and authorize the service.  Today I got to pick up the lens.  It appears to be fine now.  I will, of course, be testing it more rigorously.  They warranty their work on lenses for 6 months.  I'd go with five stars, but I want to shake-down the lens first.  I reserve the right to come back an increase my rating if I'm still happy a few months from now!  But this has just become my go-to repair place for all things photographic.

OK...I know this is a chain.  I try to steer away from chains most of the time.  In this case we had an appointment nearby, and it was incredibly convenient.  Plus sometimes you want simple food.  OK...enough justification...  We find this better than KFC.  The marinade they use is subtle but flavorful.  The chicken at this location was no exception. The beans are ordinary pinto beans.  At least they aren't that refried muck.  The rice is very lightly seasoned, not what I would call Mexican rice despite its color.  However, adding a bit of pico de gallo to both makes them better.  We ordered a "three course meal".  This included soup and a dessert.  The soup was fine (again, add some salsa to jazz it up a bit).  The dessert was supposed to be chocolate churros.  But the manager was very accommodating. She let us swap out the churros for a brownie.  That's good customer service.  The brownie was pretty dry (so I wouldn't recommend it), but I give credit for the customer service.  I have to round UP my rating instead of rounding down.  So instead of 3.5 stars I have to go to four.    Understand that is for the sort of place this is.  I'm not comparing to Kona Grill.  This is a fast food chicken place.  It's not fair to rate them against Vintage 95.    Also, the place was clean (dining room...I didn't check the restroom).

We've been here a few times now.  An eclectic variety of dishes with a unique twist on each.  An American fusion of cuisines that they make their own, ranging from pizzas to grilled meats and fish.  Haven't had a bad meal yet!  Good stuff.  And on your birthday they'll credit you $10 towards whatever you want on the menu.

I really like this place. An eclectic American fusion menu including unique pizzas, burgers, seafood, and more. Good stuff.  You order at the counter, and seat yourself.  Service is friendly.  And on your birthday they credit you $10 towards your meal.   A nice little gem in Gilbert.

Haven't reviewed this place in almost 2 years.  I should probably update!  Liberty Market appears to be very popular, always busy. Some nights they have chef's specials.  Tonight was one of those nights, and that's what I ordered (the rib-eye).  First, it was overpriced (probably the only reason not to give them 5 stars tonight).  But it was cooked perfectly, and had a nice sauce.  The accompanying potatoes and broccoli (from Agritopia) was very nice.  A solid four-star dish.  The others ordered a burger (with chips) and a pizza.  They seemed to enjoy them.  The prices on those were also a bit more reasonable.  Service was very good.  We were greeted several times between the door and the counter, and a woman I think was likely the owner checked on us later as well.  This remains one of our favorite American cuisine restaurants with a unique flare.  Not ostentatious or snooty.  A casual elegance.

Seems like I review them every two years!    As always, they are a nice place with a unique take on basic food like burgers and salads.  Their menu is getting a little stale.  Seems it's always the same.  At least the lunch menu was (we came for lunch).  I've already tried all the stuff I want to try.  Maybe it's just me.  But don't misunderstand, the food is good.  I just can't imagine coming here all the time.  It would get monotonous.  Their prices are still a bit high.  If you want a bottled soda it's $3.  I could see maybe half that (which is still too much, but not unusual for a restaurant).  We had the choice of breakfast or lunch menus.  We opted for the breakfast because, frankly, we've been through the lunch one pretty thoroughly.  The chorizo dishes (burrto and chesadilla) were very good.  The Sicilian scramble was not as good, but still good.  I probably need to come for dinner more.  I haven't exhausted that menu, yet.

This place is outstanding.  When you show up there will almost certainly be a line.  But it's worth the wait.  They take the most boring meal of the day (breakfast) and make it exciting.  I had the green chile pork omelet.  The flavors were bold.  It was wonderful.  And I don't really like breakfast.  The others in our party enjoyed their food also.  The portions are generous, and the prices reasonable.  I will almost certainly be back!

Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.

This is not specific to this location.  I am finding all Paradise locations are 2-star.  They aren't BAD, but they aren't really great either.  The staff here was friendly enough, and was even calling some customers by name (I assumed they were regulars).    On this occasion we got bagels, scones and cookies for a meeting.  OK...the scones were really good.  I gotta give them credit.  They were very popular at the meeting.  If it was just the scones they'd probably get four stars.  The bagels were "just bagels", and they didn't offer us any cream cheese (we made the mistake of assuming it was included, so didn't think to ask for any).  The ones at Einstein Brothers are better, and they include the cream cheese (though you do pay a little more for their "baker's dozen", if you buy the cream cheese at Paradise it's about the same).  We ended up getting cream cheese at Einstein because the Paradise was too far away when we realized the error.  They should have asked if we wanted any at Paradise when we were buying the bagels.  Maybe 2.5 stars for the bagels, but deduct a star for neglecting to mention cream cheese.  The cookies taste manufactured.  That's the only way I can express it.  Not like fresh homemade cookies.  Like a machine's interpretation of what a cookie should be.  I am not impressed.  And this isn't the first time.  I think I am done with their cookies.  One star there.  So, overall, that's an average of 2 and 1/6 stars.  Or just 2.

It's a good Safeway.  Predictably good meats and produce, and some of the bakery items are pretty good too (artisan breads).  Not the cheapest of the groceries. Shop the sales and you can save some money.  This one is particularly cool because they cater to an older crowd (Sun Lakes).  So they have some better stuff, in my opinion.  Less of the kids junk food (Lunchables and that crap), and more stuff to appeal to grown-ups.  They have the kids' stuff, too, but you can tell the difference when you shop here.

Fry's generally has good prices, and good sales.  We like their meats and produce.  They also support local charitable groups with gift cards in which a portion of the gift card sales goes to the group.  All around a good store.

As the name says, it's a deli.  A hoagie shop.  And it blows the chains (Subway, Quiznos, etc) out of the water.  It's a family-owned place.  The staff is very friendly and nice, and go out of their way to be helpful.  They know several of their customers by name.  They have several kinds of hot and cold sandwiches, and you can customize them any way you like.  I had the "chicken steak", and had them melt provolone on it, and add marinara, onions and peppers.  The portions are large, and the price is quite reasonable.  Oh...and they "import" cheesecake from NYC.  It's really good too.  Don't let the simple decor fool you.  The chairs and tables are cheap, but the food is really good.  They do close early, so be warned.  3pm on Sat, and 6pm Mon-Fri.  Closed Sun.  Cash only.

Dr Leber has great credentials.  Stanford Medical among them.  She is an internal medicine specialist.  She also makes the "top docs" list frequently.  My wife has been going to her for many years (probably about 15).  She is very good.  She does move fast, but if you have questions she will answer them before leaving the room.  If you are already a patient, and you need to be seen you can get a same-day appointment.  She will fit you in.  Definitely a top doc.  She had to close her practice because she was so much in demand that she couldn't handle the patient load.  Since closing it she is back to the high standard we have come to expect.  She opens it up occasionally to admit new patients, but you have to call to find out if she's open now.

We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.    They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasn't bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it.

This is an excellent outdoor outfitter.  They have hiking boots, backpacks, cold weather gear, sleeping bags, and assorted tools and toys for outdoor stuff.  This is probably my favorite place for such equipment.  I bought my last pair of boots here.  This time I was returning a hydration bladder.  I had hoped to make it work with my camera pack, but I couldn't do it.  So REI took it back, no muss no fuss.  Also, their sales people are generally friendly and knowledgeable.  So far whenever I show up there is someone in the store who knows about whatever I need.  Definitely don't go to Walmart or other big box stores.  They're cheaper, but they're cheaper FOR A REASON.  When you're out in the wilderness all you have is your equipment.  Cheap can be very expensive in that situation.  Come here and get the good stuff you need for your activity.

This seems to be a one-man shop.  As the name says, he repairs shoes and luggage.  On this occasion we had a luggage handle fail.  It took about a week to get it back, but the handle has been reattached.  Appears to be very solid, and the price was quite reasonable.  In dealing with customers he seems to be very no-nonsense.  Somewhat aloof and professional.  Which is fine.  He was direct and polite, and that's good enough.  I will be coming back here with any future shoe or luggage problems.  He also does have a very limited selection of products for sale (e.g. shoe inserts).

This is a nice Safeway.  It has the usual products you expect at Safeway.  Good meats, good produce.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  One even recommended a bakery to us this visit.  Turned out to be a good bakery, too.  Sometimes they can be a little pricey, but they often have good sales.  And their new Android app really helps too.

This Chipotle is sort of tucked into the shopping area.  Easy to see if you are in the right place, but otherwise a bit of a hunt.  It has the some format as every other Chipotle we've been to.  Burrito prepared quickly.  It was very tasty, as usual.  Seemed a bit smaller (I usually can't finish one in a single sitting).  But I can't be sure about that.  As fast food goes, this is some if the better stuff.

Hard to rate this.  It's a historic building in downtown Phoenix.  I could rate the show, but what does that have to do with the theater??  Because it is historic, it's old.  (Duh!)  As such they do things we might not today.  The waiting area before they open the doors to the auditorium is very small.  Not much they can do about that, but it was almost shoulder-to-shoulder, hard to move around too much.  Possible, but hard.  The concession stand was up-scale (a wine bar, really).  The lines were not well defined.  Inside the seats were pretty comfortable with ample leg room.  The sound was not integrated into the theater, and was speakers on the stage.  As we were sitting towards the left-front we were moderately close to the speakers and the volume was annoying.  Too loud.  I know they did that for the people in the back, but it's a bit unpleasant for those of us up close.  If they could retrofit some speakers in the walls or ceilings (or even just high above the stage) that would be nice.

I've said it before when reviewing other FCU branches, and I'll say it again:  banks SUCK!  First Credit Union is not a bank.  They report to no shareholders, no investors.  There's just the members (like me!).  Service is better, fewer (and smaller) fees, and a full-range of services.  The only down-side is fewer locations.  But that's not a major problem since I have direct deposit to my checking account, and I can pay most other bills electronically.    FCU also financed my last car, and our home.  Leave your bank. Come to a credit union.  I am happy with this one, but there are other CUs to choose from (which you may qualify to join).

This is a lovely restaurant in downtown Chandler.  It's not a typical "Mexican" place.  Sure it has the usual stuff (burros, etc).  But you can also get chicken mole!!  The service is good, the food is good, and the menu has some different items on it.  And when the weather is nice they have a patio.  I should really come here more often.

These folks are open for breakfast and lunch only.  The menu is modest.  A few varieties of breakfast burritos, plus some "classic" items like tacos and burros.  I've had the chorizo breakfast burrito and the shredded beef tacos.  The former was tasty, but a bit mild.  Chorizo should have a 'kick' to it, but theirs doesn't.  Perhaps it's the other things in it that diluted it.  The tacos were excellent.  Simple, but really good.  I will likely be back, and I will try the chimi.  The result of that may either raise or lower my rating.  This rating really is about 3.5 stars, but YELP doesn't allow that.  I rounded up because Ramon was very friendly and helpful.

Their hours are not the most convenient, and they don't pay for glass, but they're the most convenient place on the east side and their staff is friendly.  You can also drop off lots of stuff that they won't pay for, but at least you're recycling.  They pay for cans and plastic bottles (and maybe some other things, but that's all I ever bring).

We were referred by a coworker.  My wife had a new prescription and wanted to get both sunglasses and progressive glasses.  Lenscrafters seemed to be a bit high (though we've had generally good luck with them, and they do stand behind their work).  So based on the recommendation we decided to have these folks quote the glasses.  The quote for the sunglasses, using the same insurance, was lower than Lenscrafters.  Their frame selection was comparable (maybe a little less, but not a lot).  The staff was friendly and helpful.  And while they didn't have that whiz-bang frame-fitting gizmo that Lenscrafters does, they seemed to get it done just as quickly.  We are due to pick up the glasses in a week or two.  I'll update this review then (you'll know because this sentence will be deleted when I do!).

I've come here twice now.  First time the car was totaled, so I couldn't really rate their work.  This time it was a "fender-bender", so I can.  We have the car back already, and they seemed to have done a good job.  It was really very minor, but in repairing the rear bumper they had to remove it and so also were able to verify that the structure underneath was not damaged.  I came here because my insurance prefers them, but I would come here anyway.  The only other shop I've found that I like is T&S, who also do a great job.  Chandler is a bit closer to us, though, and as good as T&S.

We have been fans of Buca for a while now.  We don't usually make it to the Scottsdale location, but this time we did.  And they did not disappoint.  The carbonara  was very good, as was the supremo pizza (thin crust, slightly charred, crispy, and very flavorful sauce and toppings).  Service was reasonably good.  So far it's probably the best Italian food we've found in the Valley.  Which is amazing for a chain restaurant!  There may be some mom-and-pop place that's better, but we haven't found it yet.  This is our first choice for Italian.

We decided it would be fun to check this out.  Make a day of it.  I won't spend any time on the "town".  Suffice to say it was disappointing.  Little kids might like it.  When they say "admission to the town is free" it's not really true.  Yes, you can walk down the street for free, but if you want any of the attractions they will charge you.  Be warned.  On to the steak house.  The ambiance is not bad.  Very rustic.  There was no band when we were there, but they do have a stage for one.  Not sure that would help.    They have no bread service.  So after you order you have nothing to munch while you wait.  And you will wait.  They weren't very busy but we waited.  You would think they must be cooking it fresh, right?  Well...read on...  When the food came it looked like typical fare for a steak house.  The steak was a bit tough, but pretty good.  Not $21 good (yes, it was $21), but pretty good.  They appear to use real fire (which is a plus!).  But for $21 I expect a LOT more.  Frankly, Black Angus or Outback are just as good (or better) for less.  The fries were lukewarm.  Definitely not fresh from the oil.  And now comes the puzzle.  The chicken was cooked through, but still cold.  Not COLD, but not even really lukewarm.  Did they really cook this fresh?  I don't see how or it would have been HOT.  I suspect it was reheated.  And before you think maybe it was a fluke, the neighboring table had cold chili.  Yes, that's right.  Of the half dozen or so occupied tables at least TWO of them had cold meals.  Something is fishy here.  They did take the chicken (and the chili at the next table) back and replace it.  But I don't buy that it was a fluke.  I think they are reheating old food.  And doing a poor job of it.  If you want this sort of food (steak, chicken, etc), there are a lot of places you can go that will do it better for cheaper.  This place is all hype, but they don't perform.  We won't be going back.  They get one star because the steak was pretty good, and because YELP doesn't allow zero stars.

Our oven's temperature probe hasn't been working properly.  E&J was one of the service companies the manufacturer specified.  Good Yelp ratings, so I called for an appointment.  They scheduled quickly.  The tech came out and determined that the control board was dead.  I wish I could say how the repair went, but the board is VERY expensive and so we decided not to fix it.  Everything else works fine.  Instead I bought a temp probe with transmitter.  Cost about $60 and lets me know when meat is at the desired temperature.  That's 1/10th the cost of the repair.  I did have to pay for the service call, which is fine.  If I had done the repair they would have charged only for the repair, which is a good policy.  I expect I will call them again for my future appliance service needs.

Initially my wife came here because of a problem her other dentist didn't think was a problem.  She got to see Dr Konkle, and he did a filling for her.  Problem gone!  Since then both she and I have had cleanings and some additional work also.  She saw Dr Hatch this last time.  They seem to do good work.  Both Konkle and Hatch.  We were able to get in relatively quickly, and in my case the filling that was a bit painful recently was quickly replaced.    The hygienist was different, and contradicted things I had been told in the past.  Still undecided about her.  But there are several to choose from.  So far two fillings handled well.  Overall, seems to be a good practice.  If it wasn't for a concern or two with the hygienist I would probably go 5 stars here.  But given that most of my chair-time is with the hygienist I think that has to factor into the ratings.  So four stars, and I can recommend them for anyone seeking a dentist.

I can't speak as a gambler.  But as a hotel I really like the Rio.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  It is off the Strip, but you can walk across the bridge or take the free shuttle to Harrah's (or Bally's), so it's not a big deal to me.  And the price is usually very reasonable.  Especially given how nice the rooms are.  And the buffet...the Rio buffet is one of the best.  Huge variety, generally really good food.  But that's a different review!

We were advised that their BBQ ribs were to die for.  They do them special after 4pm, and we just had to do it.  So we did.  Frankly, they were adequate.  Nothing special.  I can think of two places near my home (Phoenix) that are better.  Not sure what my friend was thinking.  But their brew was pretty good.  We won't make a point of going back, but you could do worse.

I really enjoyed Mystère.  It didn't seem to have an obvious story to it.  But it was a lot of fun.  Some very nice acrobatic work mixed with some funny stuff.  The funny was mostly to keep the audience occupied while they setup equipment for the next acrobatic sequence.  Probably the weakest part of the show was the traditional trapeze act.  Seen this a dozen times at Ringling Bros when I was a kid.  Really basic transfers and catches.  Kinda boring, really.  That's the only reason I didn't go 5-stars.  Except for that the show was engaging and entertaining, and reasonable prices are available (we got our tickets from one of the discount ticket booths on the strip; those are same-day tickets and seat selection may be limited, but it worked out well).  Out tickets were either second or third tier, and they were great.  We could see all the action.  The theater isn't that big.  I can recommend this show.  Kids may or may not like it.  It's not really a circus, so they might get bored.  It's more aesthetic and grace, rather than Bozo the clown and elephants.

This has been my favorite buffet for a long time.  It is huge.  They have a very large selection of food, and it's all really good stuff.  A wide variety including Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and American. The only thing I noted this time compared to previous visits is that they didn't have some of the fancier dishes anymore.  They used to have hasenpfeffer (for example), but no more.  I seem to recall other things like chateaubriand, but nothing like that this time.  They also seem to have removed their burger station (which is good...why pay so much for a buffet only to get a burger??).  Overall it's still my favorite buffet, but I have not been to the Bacchanal at Ceasar's...I hear good things about that one, but it's very expensive.  The Carnival World buffet is on the "Buffet of Buffets" pass, which is very cool.

This place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  They have a boring, uninspired menu. Nothing special. The food itself was fine.  It was fresh, and they apparently use all-natural organics.  We had the special Denver scramble. The home fries are chunks of pan-fried potato. Lots of rosemary.  But the flavors just weren't very exciting or bold.  The strawberry preserves were very good, as was thick cut toast.  Yes, the toast is worth mentioning.  Cut thick, toasted to perfection.  And the bread itself is a really good bread.  I doubt I will return.  If I'm going to go out for breakfast I would choose someplace that features bolder flavors, like The Farmhouse in Gilbert.  My wife liked it better than I did.  It's really not bad, but if I'm going to go out and pay for a meal I prefer something less pedestrian.

Don't know how I missed this place before.  Spotted it here on Yelp.  Had the chance to stop in for lunch.  The owner is VERY gregarious.  And loud.  Which is fine.  I like seeing an enthusiastic owner.  They usually want to do a good job.  This place seems to be pretty authentic.  The proprietor apparently is from Puerto Vallarta.  Fresh ingredients. Home made. Authentic and flavorful.  I had the burro (enchilada style) because I almost always get a burro or chimi when trying a new place so I have a basis to compare to other places.  When I said "rice and black beans" I had thought they would be on the side, but like many burro places he put them inside.  Which is fine.  Though ti did allow a bit of skimping on the meat.  It was very good, though.  My wife had the "tacos".  These are more like miniature tostadas except the tortilla is soft.  I think actually this is more authentic than either a tostada or a "typical" taco one finds in most places.  But again, lots of rice and tortilla, not as much meat.  Tasty, but just too many carbs.  A little more meat, maybe some added veggies (tomato, peppers, onions, etc) and a bit less on the starchy stuff would have helped.  Just three tiny tacos and a mound of rice (my wife opted for no beans).  I would probably rate this 3.5 stars, but I can't do that.  And the owner's enthusiasm and cheerfulness makes me round it up.  I think I will come back and try them again sometime.  Try something different.  The flavors were very good, but we just wanted a bit more meat and less starch.

I am not a fan.  Instead of being able to go where you want you have to walk past everything they have.  There are a couple of short cuts, but they aren't always obvious.  And most of what they have is really pretty cheap stuff (cheap in how they made it, not necessarily price).  They do have some interesting ideas (like how to have a complete apartment in something like 150 sq ft).  I would take their stuff over anything at Walmart, but how it's made and how it looks is just cheap.  I really don't like the look of most of their stuff.  We bought a basic table (similar to a side table).  It's nothing fancy, but it will serve the purpose (we're going to cover it and put a mini fridge on it so we don't have to bend over to get into it).  Probably could have gotten a cheaper one at Walmart, but those are particle-board crap.  This one appears to have been solid pine.  Anyway, there are a lot better furniture and household stores out there.  In my opinion this place is more hype and fad than anything else.

I've lived in the Phoenix area for over 17 years, and this is the best BBQ I've found so far.  No contest.  I'm partial to the pulled pork, but their brisket also is awesome.  And the bbq beans are to die for...  Two sauces available...regular and habanero bbq sauce.  And homemade root beer and lemonade!  Oh...and on your birthday they feed you for free (up to $10).  Great food, great prices.  A gem for any BBQ fan.

Well, after two years I should probably update my review!  There isn't much to update, though.  They have maintained the quality and flavor that got five stars from me two years ago.  A friendly, casual place with some awesome pecan wood smoked meats, and beans that are out of this world.  Their brisket also is really good.  As usual I got the pulled pork and beans.  Plus their homemade root beer.  Heaven!  I continue to compare all other BBQ places I visit against Joe's, and so far Joe's has won every time.  They remain, in my opinion, the best BBQ in town.

More than a year since my last review, and they're still doing it right. Best pulled pork anywhere. At least I haven't found better. I see why they were top 10 in a national rating not long ago.  Pecan smoked meats, and killer sides. Especially the beans.  Homemade root beer and lemonade, and their fountain has red cream soda (alas, not homemade).  Beef pork, chicken, "bakers", beans, potato salad, mac and cheese, and a few different desserts.  They don't do it fancy here but they do it well.  If you want BBQ, this is the place to go.  Hands down, no question, no contest.  When the weather is nice they even have outdoor seating.

I find myself back at Joe's!  They're still doing it right.  Obviously the menu never changes.  In this case that's not a problem because this is a BBQ place.  If you want BBQ then you come here.  And this is THE place you want to come.  Pulled pork and bbq beans.  Soooo good.

Obviously a big chain. This location was very busy when we arrived. The offer crepes. Birthday gets you free pancakes.  "IHOP" is a shortened version of their original name.  I remember "International House of Pancakes".  And one thing they do well is pancakes.  Light, fluffy...nice.  My wife had that, and I tried a bite.  Yes, very nice.  I had the chicken-fried steak.  Totally underwhelming.  Even Denny's does better on that one.  So I suppose if you really want pancakes, this is a good option.  If you want something else, maybe not.  The free birthday pancakes are a good reason to visit, but otherwise I can't think of one.

First visit to this theater.  I don't recall which number theater they put us in, but it was a nice theater (screening of World War Z!  First, the rows had plenty of leg room.  People going by did not necessitate you standing for them to get past you.  Just pulling your legs in was enough.  The arm rests were double-wide!  No more trying to share a 2" wide arm rest with your neighbor!  And the seats and arm rests had very nice cushioning.  Very comfortable!  The screen was a reasonable size.  Our particular one had a dirty spot of some sort which was visible when bright portions of the picture were projected onto that area.  They should clean or fix that somehow.  It was a little distracting at times.  The sound system was pretty good.  Not as good as some, but definitely good enough.  I have eschewed AMC for a while now.  But this theater is a winner.

I like harkins. This isn't as good as some of their newer ones, but it's still good.  Seats were comfortable, sound system was OK, screen was a tad small (but maybe I'm getting spoiled).  Staff seemed friendly.  It was a good experience.  Last time we were here we did the IMAX, and it is a great IMAX.

Allow me to preface by saying that I'm rating this as a fast-food chicken joint.  Comparables are places like KFC and Louisiana Fried Chicken and Churches (etc).  I'm not comparing to Pappadeaux's or anyplace like that.  We were coming from a work out.  Didn't eat much before (hard to work out on a full stomach...sometimes get to feeling really sick when we do that).  So we were HUNGRY!  A craving for chicken was in the air, and especially Louisiana Fried Chicken.  But there was a notice on their door that the landlord had locked them out.  Consulting YELP we spotted "Popeye's".  So off we go!  The place didn't look special at all.  Routine fast-food look with a drive-thru.  Menu was similar to other fast food chicken places, except the "Cajun rice", "Cajun fries", "red beans and rice", and "Jambalaya".  You can get the chicken "regular" or "Cajun".  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I went with a deal they had painted on their window, and then ordered some extras (Jambalaya and two sides).  Then realized maybe there was a deal that would include that and cost less.  The guy looked at the total, checked his board quickly, and said that was the best way to get what I wanted.  The food took about as long as expected for a fast food chicken joint.  The fries were like most seasoned fries I've had.  Maybe a little more kick, but not much more.  They were very good, but didn't jump up and say "Cajun" to me.  The Cajun rice was similar to a dirty rice (Cajun), and was good.  Not spicy (hot), but very tasty.  The Jambalaya was also good.  Again, not spicy.  Not comparable to Pappadeaux's.  But good.  We ordered half/half for the chicken so we could try the regular and the spicy.  The regular was like KFC used to be long ago (when KFC was "Kentucky Fried Chicken", and was good).  It was your basic good fried chicken.  The spicy was a bit inconsistent.  Some pieces were "I feel the burn" while others were more mild.  I preferred the spicy anyway.  Good fried chicken with a bit more flavor.  Frankly, I prefer the food at Louisiana Fried Chicken, but that doesn't do much good since they are evidently out of business (unless they can pay-off the landlord and get un-locked-out).  Popeye's was very good for what it is.  I foresee Popeye's being our new Cajun chicken joint for now.  If LFC comes back I may have to re-evaluate.  But we were very happy with the food we got here.  In fact, we even had the leftovers for lunch today!  :-)

This is part of a chain of markets.  They seem to specialize in Filipino foods in particular, but there is a variety of other stuff.  Plus mostly fresh seafood (I mean, this is Vegas...there is no ocean...but it still seems pretty fresh).  Plus lots of grocery items for the Asian/Filipino recipes you want to do.  Patis, bagoong, sauce for Filipino spaghetti, etc, etc.  Overall, a good market.

I started with E Leslie Pospisil probably 17 years ago now.  He was recommended by a coworker.  And I stuck with him.  He was careful, gentle, and seemed to only do work when it was needed.  About the time he went into semi-retirement (and now full retirement) his sons had graduated and were entering the field.  Dr Doug inherited me (and my family).  Dr Doug, like his dad, is thorough and gentle.  He does his best to minimize discomfort from the injections (there is only so much he can do, but he does try).  He is conservative in his drilling and recommendations so you know when he suggests something that you really do need it.  And he will spend as much time as he needs to do the job right. You don't feel he is trying to rush you out of there.  You really couldn't ask anything more from your dentist.  Unfortunately our favorite hygienist moved away.  But he has several good ones, and you can request your favorite (once you have a favorite).  Going to the dentist is never fun, but you should go a couple times a year and this is a good guy to go to.

Time for my biannual cleaning.  I was taken back reasonably quickly, and they set to work.  The Pospisil brothers run a good office.  There is some variability among the hygienists, but they're all pretty good.  I see "Dr Doug", and he's gentle but thorough.  She also sees my wife and daughter.  He's handled several issues over the years, and they've all been successful.  So we keep coming back twice a year.

This is the main branch of First Credit Union.  It's a bit bigger than most of the others.  But it's still the credit union.  Check my reviews of the others, this one is the same.  Banks suck, credit unions rock.  I use banks as little as possible, preferring instead the no-hassle credit union environment.  As I've said before, they have no shareholders.  They are responsible to their members.  Banks only care about the quarterly report to their shareholders, and they make all those profits off of YOU!

We had an occasion and were seeking a good restaurant.  Scanning options nearby we spotted this place.  Good ratings here on Yelp.  So we decided to go.  Driving by it is not obvious this place is here.  It looks like  motel from the outside.  Inside there is a shop and this restaurant.  The menu is a large board above the counter.  It's a dive.  But the ratings were really good, and a dive isn't necessarily bad.  So we got in line.  The three of us ordered different things.  I got the signature dish (ahogadas Guadalajara), my wife got the caldo de res (soup), and our guest got a chicken burrito.  Plus a side of rice (me).  My wife says her soup was good.  Our guest says her burrito was good.  I didn't notice any great enthusiasm, but they apparently were content.  My dish is essentially a smothered sandwich.  They take the meat they would normally wrap in a tortilla and put it on a bolillo bread.  I see why there wasn't enthusiasm from my dining partners.  My ahogadas was fine.  Not great, but fine.  The sauce tasted a lot like chili powder.  Reminded me of a sauce I made years ago in college that was basically tomato soup and chili powder.  Really underwhelming.  And the rice was REALLY underwhelming.  Very weak flavor.  I've had authentic Mexican food, both in Mexico and here in Phoenix (I still mourn the loss of La Tolteca to fire).  This really isn't it.  If the other reviewers here like it, that's their prerogative.  But I most definitely don't agree that this is particularly authentic or good.  It's not bad.  If I were in high school I could see coming here to get away from school food (as we noticed:  about 15 minutes after we got there the line got VERY long full of high school kids from Chandler High).  But otherwise, no.  I could come here again, but I wouldn't make a point of it.  Real rating would be 2.5 stars if I had that option.

This place is really really good.  Simple food, but done very well.  Service is good.  A tad pricey, but even something as basic as a steak is done extremely well.  Better than most of those snooty expensive places, too.

I decided to do an update to my original review.  Yes, we still give 5 stars.  Today is my third or fourth visit.  My first visit was April 2010 on my anniversary.  I had the Aspen Sirloin, and it was very good.  Light seasoning, but just enough for a nice flavor.  Meat was juicy even though I like mine medium-well (very little pink).  Sometimes places when they try to achieve 'medium-well' will dry the steak out.  Firebirds got it just right!  The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also very nice.  Good flavor without being overpowering (Parmesan can be pretty strong).  And the bread service was great.  It comes out fresh and hot!  I love fresh bread still warm from the oven!  I do wish they had a wheat loaf like Black Angus, though.  But it was wonderful.  They offer numerous dishes here, not just steaks.  You can get salmon, chicken, pasta, even burgers and sandwiches.  So far I've tried the Aspen Sirloin, and the au poive steak (I've had that twice...it's totally awesome!).  Their fresh lemonade was perfect!  It's not the swill from the fountain.  This is real, fresh lemonade.  Truly wonderful.  A bit pricey, but I highly recommend this place if you want good American cuisine.  Nothing fancy, but what they do is done extremely well.  Simple flavors to accentuate the entree, not cover it up.  I'm not sure any of the high-end fancy places could do any better.  Probably not as good, in many instances.

Well, it's been a while.  My old reviews are stale.  So here we go again...  I still rate this 5 stars.  They are still a bit pricey, the menu is basically the same as before, and the service is really good.  We come here every few months.  Usually on an occasion as this is a bit more appropriate than Outback or Chipotle for an occasion.  Today was no exception.  We received an email coupon for a "free side salad" (with entree purchase), which was a nice bonus.  My wife wanted the salad, so I ordered the kobe meatloaf.  She ordered some soup because we expected a relatively petite salad.  Well, we were wrong.  The salad was huge.  Filled up my wife so that she barely touched her tortilla soup (though she did try it and said it was very good).  The salad she chose was the spinach, and she loved it.  The Kobe meatloaf (with mushroom sauce) was OK.  Not as spectacular as I was hoping.  But it was good.  The mashed potatoes were good (as usual), and the beans had a nice flavor (not the tart flavor the beans of so many places have).  It wasn't a bad choice, but I doubt I would choose it again.  It just wasn't "special" in any way.  Not of the same caliber as the Aspen sirloin or the steak au poivre, even though the price was almost the same.  Still no wheat bread...but that's not enough to take away a star.

It's been two years since I reviewed here.  Time to renew.  This time we showed up for Restaurant Week.  It was a decent deal.  Hard to know if the portions were a little smaller, but the filet medallions with bleu cheese sauce on the menu is almost as much as the RW price was.  So can't really complain there.  I actually ordered the "flat iron steak" (which is a particular cut of sirloin).  I thought the portion a bit small, but not horrible.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a generous portion.  But I didn't taste the garlic like I expected.  Their signature Fired-Up sauce was too heavy for the sirloin.  Very strong flavor totally overpowered the meat.  It might have been more appropriate for a rack of ribs or something similar.  The meat was served in a puddle of that sauce.  I found a quick tap on my plate seemed to remove most of the sauce, and the little bit that was left was not too overpowering.  But they really should have used an au poivre sauce (or maybe a red wine sauce).  Would have been a better match.  The key lime pie was REALLY good.  Too much whipped cream, but that's easily removed.  Really good.  I wish I could go 5 stars, but I can't.  The sauce selection for my entree just did not work, and the garlic mashed tasted more like a cheesy mashed to me.  Not a lot of garlic (I really didn't taste any).  But I can go with 4 stars for now.  I'm sure we'll return at some point (we seem to come here a few times per year) and I will update my review again.

This is probably obvious to everyone, but this is a membership club.  You have to pay the annual fee to shop here.  And they only accept ONE credit card (American Express).  The really cool thing is you can get an AMEX card for free through Costco, and it serves as your membership card too!  Plus the cash-back bonus you get every year.  This particular store features "self scan".  Self scan is really cool.  You get a hand scanner, and as you shop you scan the items.  When you get to the register you hand over the scanner, they feed the data into their system, and you swipe your card.  That's it.  Then you just walk on out.  Costco tends to feature better quality stuff at decent prices.  Walmart may beat them on price sometimes, but the quality is never as good.  And Costco often will win the price war in any event.  You can get computers, cameras, outdoor stuff (tents, sport chairs, etc), small appliances, canned/packaged foods, fresh foods (bakery, ready-to-bake prepared foods, etc), and even optical and pharmacy.  All at prices at, or below, everyone else's.  The only bummer (sometimes) is that you have to buy in bulk.  You can't buy one onion.  You have to buy the 10 lb bag of onions.  But for a lot of stuff that isn't a problem (e.g. 3 lb package of butter, large blocks of mozzarella, big loaves of bread, etc).  Oh...and they have a car buying program, and a travel agency, both of which can get you nice discounts.  We even had our car and home insurance through Costco until our employer offered us a better deal.  Except for that, Costco beat all comers every time we shopped insurance.  The little green lizard was road-kill.  No contest.  We've been members for several years, and have overall been very happy with the products and services we get here.

Yes, I am still a fan.  Still a member.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention also that I'm a stockholder.  This place is so crowded all the time how could I not buy the stock?!    I still find a lot of great stuff here at good prices.  The selection changes from time to time.  Right now they have begun to stock their spring/summer stuff.  Jumbo weed killer, swimsuits, storage sheds, patio furniture, Turbo Tax (the cheapest you can find it anywhere is here at Costco), and more.  Plus the usual stuff like big packs of pasta, toilet paper, olive oil, rice (several kinds), cereals, butter, tortilla chips, bread, meat, and a lot more.  We bought the large storage shed two years ago (they have another one now), plus at various times some of their furniture, some clothes, our washer/dry pair (when we moved into our new house several years ago), toilet paper (of course!), butter quarters, chips, tomato bisque soup, oil, pasta, bags of rice, bags of sugar, I'm still working on my bag of salt from 20 years ago (no, I'm not kidding...big bag for cheap and we still have a little left), I always get my Roundup here (much cheaper than Home Depot), garden cart and accessories, and much more.  If you get your fuel here you'll probably save enough to pay for your membership just from that.  Their return policy is excellent, their value is excellent, their quality is generally very good; probably the only downers are that you have to get your stuff home yourself (e.g. hope you have a pickup truck to get the shed home!), and the sales people don't have the product knowledge you would find in a specialty store.  But if you know what you want, that isn't a big deal, in my opinion.  As a member you're also entitled to visit the Business Center store at 33rd Avenue (they have different stuff there...I reviewed them a while back), and also to utilize their car rental discounts, travel services, insurance services, auto center (mostly tires and batteries, I believe), optical, pharmacy, photo center, and everything else.  Costco is the first place I look for something.  If they don't have it then I'll go elsewhere, but I come here first.  Note that they are discontinuing their American Express card in April.  It will be replaced with a VISA card.  So my previous comments about AMEX in my old review don't apply anymore.  But they will accept the VISA, there will be no annual fee, and you'll still earn reward points that will show up as a check every year.

This particular location is very upscale.  Sort of like AJ's, only MUCH bigger.  Besides the usual stuff at Fry's Marketplace they have a wine and cheese bar, a "wine cellar", a small cafeteria, a sushi bar, and some really good breads (beyond the usual French bread and baguettes).  The cafeteria has some nice stuff.  When I saw them setting up for dinner they had prime rib.  They also had a cold food bar, and after you buy it you can go to a lounge with a microwave to nuke it!  I grabbed some stuffed chicken breast.  They charge $7/lb for all the stuff there (a tad pricey, but it was pretty good).  The fish counter had some really nice stuff (like ahi tuna).  I wish I lived closer.  Fry's prices on the general stuff, plus all these nice extras.  I would come here regularly if I did.  And covered parking!  Even valet, if you want it.

This Costco is further from my house, so we don't come here much.  Used to come here a lot when we lived in Chandler (before the Chandler Costco opened).  We were driving by, so we went in.  This one is an older store.  But it still has the same products as other local Costcos, and their staff is also good (like the other Costcos).  No need to make a special trip here if another one is closer.  But if you live nearby it couldn't hurt to check this place out for yourself.  Lots of benefits to Costco membership.

My wife likes this place for the "crafts".  I'm indifferent to that, though they do seem to have a large selection.  I can't really comment on the quality of it, however.  For me, this is a custom frame shop.  They publish coupons periodically for up to 60% off.  I had such a coupon this visit, and I had a photo I wanted to frame.  The frame and matte selection is good, and the staff manning the framing desk seem to know what they are doing.  We've always been happy in the past.  And with the discount coupon it's much less painful to get that memory mounted and framed.  My "art" won't be ready for a week or so, but if past experience is any indication they will do a good job with it.

This is a tough one to review.  So much is a matter of taste as opposed to a matter of fact.  I do not like Aeropostale.  This one is at Chandler Fashion Center.  The staff was very nice, friendly, and helpful.  This time I was returning something my wife bought.  No problems.  But for shopping, I do not like this place.  I find their quality to be low, and I can't stand being a walking billboard for their store.  A small logo is fine (and some of their stuff has just that), but most of their stuff says "AERO" in huge letters.  Must be a 500 pt font!  And while the fabrics are usually very soft (which is why my wife likes it), it is not durable.  I have a couple of shirts developing holes just from routine wearing (no yard work or such, just wearing to work or shopping or whatever) in less than a year.  As I have many shirts, these have only been worn/washed maybe 8 times in that year, and they already have holes.  I'd rather shop someplace with higher quality, and a smaller font.

This is a fast food burger joint.  Not as fast as McDonald's.  On the other hand, they are so much better it's not even a contest.  For what it is, this place is probably the best I've had.  This is NOT the Cordon Bleu, and I'm writing this opinion with that in mind!  Their burgers are prepared fresh (no heat lamps!), and they taste fresh.  Even if you get a McD burger hot off the griddle it tastes like something that wouldn't spoil if you let it sit out for a year.  Fatburger's burgers are hot, tasty, and seem very fresh.  Made with real ground beef (it even crumbles a bit as ground beef is prone to doing...don't ever remember McD's doing that).  The curly fries are really nice.  A light crunch, very tasty.  Also fresh and hot.  And the shakes are pretty good too.  Not the best shakes, but pretty good.  The ambiance is supposed to be sort of 50's diner.  Complete with a juke box (that looks like it's from the 70s...ooops).  As they were established in 1952, according to their signs, I guess they are trying to stay in touch with that...at least a little.  If I have a craving for a burger and fries, this would be my first or second choice of places to go.  A tad pricey, perhaps, but you can order various size burgers from 5 oz up to 24oz.  Did I mention they're really tasty?

This is a very nice bakery.  They have other stuff, too (like soups and sandwiches), but the breads are the stars. And the cinnamon roll is competitive with the likes of Cinnabon.  Numerous breads available.  I like the high 5, but they have some others that are high fiber whole grain breads too.  Their breads are very flavorful...not like that white spongy mass-produced stuff.

This seems to be a good market.  It aims primarily at Hispanic clientele.  The produce includes "ordinary" stuff, plus some unusual fruits and vegetables you generally won't find in the better-known grocery stores (Fry's, Basha's, etc).  If there's a chili pepper you want, they probably have it.  But in addition to the grocery is a juice bar with fresh-squeezed juices (like papaya, guayabana, etc).  And then there's the lunch counter.  Very Hispanic, and very good.  I don't want to say "Mexican" as I suspect it goes beyond just that.  It's simple fare, but very good.  It rivals most full-service restaurants (and beats most of those!).  Great lunch counter, good grocery, a juice bar, and a Hispanic bakery.  Probably the best such market we've found around town (I just wish it wasn't so far from home).

This is a good Costco.  I do wish they had the hand scanners like the Chandler Costco.  But the store is clean and has all the Costco services (optical, pharmacy, bakery, etc).  Of course, you will always spend more than you planned here.  It seems unavoidable.

You can't beat Costco.  I like Costco so much I actually bought the stock.  This Costco is a good one.  Each one is slightly different.  They seem to carry a few different things depending on the area.  There's a lot of cross-over as well.  One thing I noted was that they have expanded their LED lighting selection...as soon as I need some new 4' tubes I'm coming back here to pick up a pair.  Great prices, good quality, products we want and need.  They change seasonally (so if you think you need weed killer better stock-up while they have it!).  We always end up spending more than we planned.  Too much good stuff!  You easily can save enough money to pay for the membership.  Heck, just gasoline alone can do that.

This is a difficult review to write.  There are really two parts to it.  The first is the actual chiropractic experience.  Dr Bos is a Gonstead practitioner.  I've used that before, and it seems to be a good system.  I came to Bos because it is closer to my office, and because he uses Gonstead.  He has been reasonably successful at alleviating my problem.  It's not completely gone yet, but it's going away.  I feel confident asserting that his efforts are responsible for this.  So that part is all good.  But...  He also hawks snake oil.  This really irritates me.  He has potions and compounds for all sorts of things.  These are not medically approved items.  They either have not been shown to work, or have been shown not to work.  He tried to convince us to purchase one after administering a dose and then "demonstrating" improvement...in less than 10 seconds.  Excuse me?  I'm not an MD but I do know that anything you ingest will not be absorbed in 10 seconds.  It takes two or three seconds just to get down to the stomach.  Then it needs to absorbed (which will take tens of minutes, at least).  And then it has to work its way through the bloodstream, which takes more time still.  And he's claiming improvement was observable in less than 10 seconds.  I hate this kind of woo-woo pseudo-science stuff.  I have to deduct stars in the rating for this sort of rubbish.  Otherwise I might have given 5 stars.  He's a good chiropractor, and knows what he's doing in that area.  My problem is dramatically better.  But all those supplements and potions are pseudo-scientific nonsense. I know it's appealing to "go natural", but the fact is there is little or no science behind most of it.  I can recommend him if you have back/neck pain, but just ignore the potions.  As I once heard it said, all you're doing is making expensive urine.

It's been over a year since I reviewed.  I will reiterate my 4-star review.  Dr Bos uses Gonstead methods, and is very thorough.  He never seems to be in a hurry to finish with you.  If you arm hurts, he'll check it.  We get good results with him.  We continue to come to him as needed.  You can pre-pay and get a reduced rate, which we do.

We stopped here after shopping at the nearby market.  Just a whim.  Glad we did.  They have a very large menu of smoothies (and other drinks, including boba, of course).  I had a fruity smoothie (honestly forget what exactly, but it was tropical).  It was very good.  Not much seating inside, so expect to take it out.  When we were there it was SRO.

First visit here.  Heard good things about it, and had a chance to try a slice someone brought home once.  We were coming back from a movie, it was late, and we had a craving for pizza.  We made a good choice.  We arrived about 15 min before closing.  Almost nobody in the place.  The bartender (there is a bar by the entrance) greeted us and gave us menus.  We ordered pepperoni and mushroom take-out.  She put in the orders and then brought us some water while we waited.  I could see them hand-tossing our pizza, and within about 15-20 minutes (I would guess...I wasn't timing them) we had our piping-hot pizza!  Took it home and served it up!  It was a simple pizza, but it was very good.  The sauce, the cheese, and the toppings were reasonably generous (could have been a bit more, but it was good).  They do NY-style crust, so it's fairly thin.  I definitely can see coming back here!

This is a high-end market.  You can get sushi-grade tuna, fine cuts of meat, various gourmet prepared foods, etc.  Plus their cafe is better than what you usually find in a grocery.  And they have a sushi bar.  And a really good soup bar.  You can find most items you would find in a normal grocery, but higher-end.  Better quality.  Pricey, but very good stuff.

Sort of mixed, but...  First, let's talk about "the bad".  I'll try to shorten this a bit for those not interested in reading a novel!  We show up to emergency.  Pretty severe abdominal pains.  They get her checked-in and tested pretty quickly.  CT scan and sonogram show there is "something" in the common bile duct.  Due to insurance nonsense this isn't enough to warrant "in-patient" admission, so she's taken to the "observation" area.  MRI next morning confirms these are stones (which is good news...before the MRI they couldn't be sure they weren't cancerous masses).  Now here's where it gets bad.  First a surgeon visits and says it's either going to be him doing surgery or another doctor doing a less-invasive procedure called ERCP.  Then a second doctor shows up (GI specialist) who says ERCP.  Then a third doctor shows up who says no ERCP because the stones were too big (and that the previous doctor wasn't the one who would do the procedure if ERCP were an option, doctor #3 would have done it).  So why did doctor number 2 show up at all if he wasn't going to make the final decision anyway??  The surgeon comes back and explains what he will do, and then has to try to fit this into his already-booked schedule.  That's the short version.  And all of this while we're still in the "observation" ward a full 24 hours later.  I can't blame MGMC for the insurance policies, and will in fact credit the head nurse on the night shift with forcing the issue and getting her into a proper room so she can actually get some sleep.  This, in fact, is when the "good" starts.  Once in the room the nurses (all shifts) were great.  No more contradictory statements from doctors, either.  The following day we find out the surgery schedule.  The surgeon appears to have done a great job, and she's recovering as I type this.  With any luck she'll go home tomorrow (they just have to make sure her digestive system is functioning again).  The ER staff was great, the nurses were great, and the surgeon was great.  If they could just clean up their communication problems so the patient isn't getting erroneous and/or contradictory information from different doctors I think they'd be A++.  And, yes, I made sure their administration knew about the communication problems.

I've been coming to Discount Tire for decades now.  They have a wide variety of tires available, and can order anything they don't have.  They also offer a sort of insurance (I don't want to call it a warranty because you have to pay for it).  The coverage is pretty good, and they will replace any damaged tire.  Only normal wear is exempted.  Their people also seem to be very knowledgeable about their products.  The only bummer is that they don't offer nitrogen.  A lot of cars now are coming with nitrogen in the tires.  If you come to Discount Tire you'll lose it because they use ordinary air.  But otherwise this is a good place for all-things tires.

I was going to a shop that did custom stuff in addition to routine stuff.  Eventually he was making enough from custom work that he decided to stop the routine stuff, which left me out in the cold!  But he sent me to Ken at Desert Auto Works.  And I am soooooooooo glad he did.  Ken is da' man!  He is honest, competent, and takes the time to explain what's going on with the vehicle.  Ken also doesn't just identify an assembly and replace it.  He finds the component of the assembly that is bad, and replaces only that, saving his customers a fortune!    Most recently I have been having an intermittent problem.  Ken has wired in some lights which will tell us where the fault is the next time it occurs.  He is growing and has hired a few guys, but he seems to have chosen them carefully.  They appear to be honest and competent too.  I will keep coming here for as long as he is doing this.

Like others here I lament the loss of Ken.  But I'll bet he'll be a good doctor.  I've known Diego a LONG time (working for Ken).  So I still come here.  The service I received today was prompt and friendly from both people I dealt with (including Diego).  I cannot say if I was overcharged.  It was expensive.  Checking online I see prices ranging from about what they charged me to about 1/2 of what they charged me.  I suspect many of the cheaper ones are "knock-offs", which I would not want.  It will be sad if they have started the overcharging-mechanic game.  They were always honest and fair here.  If I find out otherwise I will amend this review and take away the stars.  I will pay close attention when I come back for a tune-up in 6 months or so.

I've seen these around for a while now.  Several locations.  Well, we ended up with a restaurant.com certificate for them.  So...time to try them out!  The service was reasonably good.  We were seated quickly, and a server showed up not long after.    We started with appetizers.  There was a craving for calamari, and so some was ordered.  It was good, but I didn't like the dipping sauce.  I prefer the marinara used at Buca.  We also got the hummus variety bowls.  The hummus was really good.  For the main course we ordered gyro and souvlaki.  Both were very good.  The menu also features stuff I don't associate with Greek (like burgers and chicken parmesan), but either way it's a good variety of choices.  Next time we'll have the flaming cheese dessert.  :-)

It's Walgreens.  Generally they are all the same.  However, I will say the pharmacy staff here is very good.  They are helpful, friendly, and seem to be efficient in filling prescriptions.  They also are good answering questions about non-prescription products.  There are probably two other Walgreens convenient to either my home or office, and another two or three CVS.  This tends to be my first choice of them all.

This is a tough one.  It's probably the best Filipino restaurant in the Phoenix area.  But that's not saying much, because the few there are here are really not good.  Compare Jeepney Bistro to one of the places in Filipino Town (Los Angeles), and they get blown away.  And, for the record, my wife is a Filipina.  And she cooks MUCH better than the chef here.  No contest.  A lot less grease/fat/oil, that's for sure!!  Also, their portions are a bit small.  Bigger than a few other places I could name, but still small.  If you really want some Filipino food, and you don't know my wife to beg some from her, this is probably your best option without driving to LA.  But don't form your opinion of Filipino food based on this place.  Go to LA and try Bahay Kubo Natin, or some others, and you'll get a much better idea of what the cuisine is about!

This appears to be one of the better mammogram facilities around.  We got the first basic mammogram at the Chandler Blvd location, and they called to do a "diagnostic" screening follow-up.  Everything was fine.  And this wasn't the first time.  In the future we will do our best to come straight here with a diagnostic order.  They seemed to be reasonably efficient, and the staff did their best to minimize her discomfort.  Given the purpose of a visit here this went well, and was a good experience.

I like Sprouts market.  They are all very similar in terms of what they carry, and I've reviewed other locations about that.  Good meats, good produce, and better processed foods than most groceries.  This day we were using their deli.  They offer sandwiches, freshly made to order.  They also have a little soup bar (generally three choices on any given day).  So we got a soup to share and a pair of fresh sandwiches.  The bread was fresh, the sandwich was good, and the price was hard to beat.    I don't know if all Sprouts do this, but I know this one and the one by our house does.  A good lunch option.

I've never been to NYC, but supposedly this is NY-style pizza.  Whatever.  It's very good.  They are probably the best pizza chain around.  Very flavorful pizza.  Tonight we had "free slice" coupons.  Not sure where they got the slices (i.e. where's the rest of the pizza?!!).  But they were fresh, hot and good.  We did take out tonight, though we have eaten in before.  In the past we haven't cared for their non-pizza dishes, but we didn't have that tonight so I won't comment this time.  You can't go wrong with the pizza, though!

Yes, we went back!  My previous review of their pizza still holds.  It's the best around that we've found so far.  Today I also had the soup.  Chicken and cheese tortellini.  It was very good.  Not spectacular, but very good.  Served with three garlic knots, which also were very good.  I'd give the soup and knots 3 stars, but the pizza remains a solid 4 stars.

Honestly, I've found a new favorite pizza.  Grimaldi's.  But...I do get NYPD emails, and they had a deal.  So we took advantage of that tonight.  We placed an online order for pickup.  The online system worked well.  When we showed up the pizza was ready.  A quick check to be sure it was my pizza, and off we go.  The pizza was as good as it always is.  NYPD does do a good pizza.  The sauce is the key to any pizza, and theirs is very good.  You can also see that they sprinkle something on top  (likely "Italian seasoning").  Ingredients seem fresh.  I didn't interact too much with the staff since it was take-out, but what little I did they were cheerful and helpful.  I still like Grimaldi's better, but this is a solid #2 right behind them.  A bit of incentive (like the coupon we had), and I'm here!  Unlike Grimaldi's, they have delivery here too.  You won't go wrong having an NYPD pizza.

For Dad's day they offered a free meal.  So we went for dinner!  I just reviewed them three months ago, and nothing has changed.  The pizza is good.  I ordered chicken parmesan, and it was reasonably good too.  I tried a slice of leftover pizza later on, and it was good.  I still like Grimaldi's better, but it was very good.  Their pizza is definitely the star.  Their other entrees are fine, but pizza is what they do best.  And you can't beat "free".  It's cool that NYPD does stuff like this on Father's Day, and Veteran's Day, etc.

First, I'm a guy.  So I get a "haircut".  I don't get waves, tones, highlights, frosts, or anything else weird.  I get a haircut.  So I cannot comment on any of the weird stuff people want done to their hair.  With Sam's you show up, get on the list, and when it's your turn you get one of the "stylists" at random (whoever finished their last client when it was your turn).  I have no idea if you can request someone, but it doesn't seem like it.  Which this time was fine since I've never been in this shop before!  My cutter (hey, I don't do "styles") was a nice, friendly young lady.  Not too chatty, but a little.  She asked how long I wanted it, the ears, and the sideburns.  And then off she goes.  When she was done most of my hair was on the floor, and what remained on my head was how I wanted it.  As a bonus she then washed it saying it was included with the service.  So then I wasn't dropping lots of little hairs everywhere as I went home!  When I come back if I see my cutter working that day I guess I'll find out if I can request or not.  She did a fine job.

I like the Elephant Bar.  Been there many times.  Their fusion of Asian, Cajun and American cuisines is somewhat unique, and tasty.  I like their jambalaya, but they also have chicken and seafood dishes that are very nice.  The decor also is kinda fun.  Their happy hour also is pretty good, and they do a reverse happy hour after 9pm.  They also have decent lunch specials.  I will have to knock them for their desserts, however.  The only one we've tried that is any good is the mud pie, and you better like coffee flavor or you won't like that either.  They do NOT have a pure chocolate dessert.  Their brownie has walnuts (I hate walnuts).  The Creme Brulee is OK.  But really, the dessert menu is very weak and disappointing.  The the main menu has a wide variety of dishes available, and you're sure to find something you will like.

Been a while since I reviewed this place. It's still good.  Their menu still has a variety of tiems, and I still think they are a bit over-priced.  But being in their email club I get coupons fairly frequently, and they make it a good value.

Great food, reasonable prices, good service.  Crawfish and shrimp by the pound.  Three sauces (as I recall) with three heat levels for each.  I had the signature "Hot & Juicy" sauce, but got mild because I was not alone.  On my own I'd probably get medium.  Great flavor.  Be ready to get messy.  They provide paper towels and bibs...you'll need them.  This is on my list anytime I return to Vegas.

I continue to come to Joe's Farm Grill on occasion.  It's not a must-visit like Joe's Real BBQ, but as I stated in my first review 18 months ago they have some items here that are not available at the other Joe's.  I have tried a few of their other dishes in that time.  Their Sonoran hot dog (with pulled pork) is very tasty, their shakes are pretty good, I do like their garlic fries(!!), and their grilled pizza is not bad at all.  I would actually give them 3.5 stars if I could.  For what they are they are very good.  Not fantastic, but very good.  A unique array of salads, burgers, and other sandwiches, hot dogs, plus the pizzas...American comfort food with a twist.  Today I went back to my "standard" and got the pork plate (comes with garlic fires and slaw, though I don't like slaw).  I have buns at home, and so can make some pulled pork sandwiches and munch on the garlic fries.  What more could you ask?

I know many are a fan. I can't really say I am.  Their BBQ is not as good as Joe's Real BBQ on Gilbert Rd, even though the same guy owns both.  But they do have a fairly large menu and some unique items.  I don't come here often, but I usually manage to find something good.  I can't really add much to my last review.  I still think they are 3.5 stars and have some good stuff.  I have to give four because they definitely don't deserve only 3.  I wouldn't mind if they mixed up the menu some.  Maybe had specials that change weekly or monthly.

This is a nice theater.  Seats are comfortable, sound is reasonably good.  But they do have their front row too close to the screen.  They should take out the first two rows, at least.  Maybe three.  Ticket prices are silly ($9.50?  really??).  But if you have a coupon, pass, student ID, or matinee, it's manageable.  Concessions are similarly expensive.  As with all theaters.  But they do offer different flavorings for popcorn.  That's nice.  We seemed to gravitate to the "kettle corn" flavor.  Their yearly refill cup is worth it if you visit several times a year (they refill for $1 all year).

This is a good theater.  Seats are good, picture and sound are good.  Prices are excessive, but that seems to be the norm now.    I get passes or matinees.  But the theater itself is very good.

This is an open-air mall.  Unlike most malls which are totally enclosed, this mall is outdoors.  In the outdoor area they sometimes have "events".  The Batman "Tumbler" was there for a day once, we've heard concerts here, and this last visit they had a sculling team there with their boat.  They have many of the usual shops (American Eagle, Gap, Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, etc).   The Harkins Theater hear is pretty nice.  We like the Genghis Grill for food (see my review of them).  The Paradise Bakery is nice also.  There are several other eateries here, but we haven't tried most of them yet.  However, several choices are available.  This is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on.

I was invited to come to this place on the spur of the moment.  I probably should have declined, but I do like Indian food and I figured I could order off the menu.  Yes, they do have a buffet here, but I hate buffets.  Allow me to digress about buffets briefly.  The first problem with them is that they encourage me to eat too much.  I always want to get my money's worth, so I stuff myself.  Not great.  Second problem is a bit more gross.  Any idea how many people wash their hands after going to the bathroom?  Maybe half?  And here is a row of food trays with utensils being handled by literally dozens of people, half of whom did not wash their hands recently.  And that doesn't include those who may be sick, or recently coughed/sneezed into their hands (without washing afterwards).  And those serving utensils are touching my food??  Uhhh...no.  So I order from the menu (more about the menu in a moment).  I'm not very hungry, so I just order a lentil soup with mixed vegetables in it (Sambar).  The waitress proceeds to the buffet line, grabs a bowl, and ladles the soup from the buffet into the bowl.  There's my sambar.  Served with one of those potentially toxic utensils I just mentioned.  Ugggh!  I wanted it from the kitchen where only one or two people who haven't washed their hands will handle it!!!!  Not cool.  The service itself was inattentive.  They seemed a bit understaffed.  Maybe someone missed work so they were short-handed?  Dunno.  But it was inattentive.  What interaction we did have with the servers was friendly.  The soup was very flavorful, but very lacking in lentils.  I expected to see lentils.  It was mostly broth with a few pieces of vegetable in it.  Disappointing.  And now for the menu...it featured a large variety of dishes.  That bit was good.  But every section that involved meat indicated the meat was halal.  Some argue that halal meat is more humane, but I do not believe that is true.  There are a few brief religious ceremonies/utterances that must be done before slaughtering the animal, but basically they hang it upside down and slit its throat while it's still conscious.  It then bleeds-out (probably at least 20-30 seconds before it passes out).  I do not see how that is more humane than the typical western method of stunning the animal first, then stringing it up and cutting the throat.  There is no suffering in the latter (if it's done properly).  I'm not squeamish about slaughtering an animal for food, and I do know where meat comes from.  The only reason to do it halal is religious, and I have a problem with inducing suffering without very good reason.  Ancient traditions that aren't really relevant to modern hygiene do not qualify in my opinion.  I'm not criticizing others' beliefs, but I do not share them and don't think I should have to partake in them.  They have plenty of vegan dishes, and that's fine.  My soup I believe was vegan.  I do wish she had brought me a fresh one from the kitchen instead of one from the buffet line.  Prices seemed a tad high to me, too.  But the place was busy, and clearly very popular with Indian people (most patrons appeared to be Indian).

This is some good cajun!  First visit here.  I'd heard a lot about this place, but living in Gilbert it's not easy to get here.  Today we were within about 4 miles, so we went for it!  Went with the family.  Between us we ordered the Cajun Combo (which was a blackened catfish and shrimp creole with dirty rice), Pasta Mardis Gras (which has andouille, crawfish, and grilled shrimp in a marinara over pasta), and a po boy and gumbo.  The po boy was good, the gumbo was very good.  And they were the least of the three orders!  The pasta and the combo were both outstanding!  Really flavorful and good!    Portion sizes were respectable.  We had to pack some of the food home.  Service was a little weak.  A bit slow and inattentive.  Not really 'bad', but could have been better.  I'd take away maybe 1/2 star for it, at most.  But I can't bring myself to downgrade a whole star, so 5 it is.  We'll definitely be coming back here when we can.  Best cajun/creole food we've found in the Valley so far.

We don't live nearby, so it's been a while.  But we happened to be nearby and so came in again.  I don't recall it being so loud last time.  It was VERY loud.  I mean really LOUD.  Not sure why.  The place was full, but I don't see why everyone was shouting.  Weird.  Various dishes were ordered.  I was hoping for a Cajun catfish.  Breaded and deep-fried.  Sounded good.  Well, it was a disappointment.  It may as well have been Long John Sliver's.  There was no seasoning.  The waitress was nice enough to bring me some Cajun seasoning which I sprinkled on the fish.  It helped, but I think it would have been better if it was part of the coating instead of adding it later.  The other dishes ordered were better (I got to sample them).  So it's clear I just ordered the wrong thing.  However, I think it fair to deduct points for this.  Everything should be flavorful and exciting.  And the fried catfish just wasn't.  It's not a question of not liking something.  The catfish was cooked properly and tasted like catfish.  But there were no exciting flavors unlike the other dishes they offer.  Why did they do that?  I expect more than Long John Silver's.  I also got a bowl of gumbo.  It wasn't quite as good as I remember from last time.  it had a slight burned flavor to it.  Like maybe they cooked the roux too long.  But it was otherwise flavorful.  I'm still a fan based on the other dishes I sampled (and wished I had ordered).  I just won't order the catfish ever again.  I also had the key lime pie.  It was a bit too sweet.  I've never had such a sweet key lime pie before. The tart tang was there, but overpowered by the sweet.  Strange.  Maybe they assumed the raspberry sauce they drizzled on the plate would help counter the sweetness?  Don't know.  I didn't use the drizzle because I just wanted key lime.  Usually whipped cream is there to counter the tartness (and there was some).  But the pie was too sweet already.  I gotta deduct a few points for that too.  So I'll take one star away.  I can't really justify taking two from them.  I definitely expect better than what I got.  It's one thing not to like something, it's another when something you like isn't executed as well as it should have been.

We've done CPK before, but this was our first visit here.  We had a "sync" special through our credit card (we synced elsewhere on the web and this deal was "loaded" onto our card by the credit company).  So we paid a visit!  The pizza was as good as I remember.  And as small.  I love the spicy Sicilian, even if it is thin crust. The food came fast. And even though we had to ask for more bread, the service was good.  There were three of us, and we finished 1.5 pizzas (the Sicilian, and a mushroom, sausage and pepperoni).  The pizzas are just a bit small.  But the flavor is very good.  One complaint would be that the bread service was cold.  I like my bread warm from the oven!  The bread was good, but warm would have been better.

We got the "Buffet of Buffets" thing.  We ended up here for our last dinner because it was right across the street from the show we were going to see (less stress getting there on-time).  We'd already gotten our money's worth out of the pass, so this buffet was "free".  We arrived at an ideal time...only one group in line ahead of us.  When we left the line was rather long.  The food was OK. Not great, but not bad.  Surprisingly they had a very limited selection.  Really just the one counter of items (maybe 10 or 15), and then the dessert counter nearby.  Literally only about 1/3rd the size of the Paris buffet, and not even 1/8 the size of the RIo.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  What they did have was pretty ordinary.  The sushi was cooked, not "fresh" (i.e. raw).  When compared to other buffets on "the Strip", this was pretty weak.  Were we not pressed for time because of the show I would have left and gone somewhere else.    One positive thing was that they have Sierra Mist.  That's the only major soda that is made with real sugar only (i.e. they don't have a high fructose corn syrup version anymore).  I avoid HFCS due to the toxic nature of it, so it was really nice that they had Sierra Mist.   They also had cotton candy.  Cotton Candy??  What, is this the state fair??  That was an odd thing to see there.  If this buffet is convenient (as it was for us), then it's OK I guess.  But you can do a LOT better if you're willing to walk a bit (or grab the shuttle to the Rio).  With the Buffet of Buffets you would do much better to visit other places.  If you don't have that, this place is cheap and not horrible.

Saw that this place seems to rate pretty well, and we had just finished a screening of Sherlock Holmes, and we were hungry, so we gave it a try.  The selection of meats was good.  My wife thought they could have had more veggies, but I thought there was an ample variety.  And then there was dry seasoning (many kinds), and sauces (many more).  The bowl was small, which was a little annoying, but you build it yourself so you can pack in as much as you can.  I packed pretty well!  Then they cook it and bring it to you.  I liked mine (using Szechuan sauce).  We all liked ours, in fact.  I can see coming back here again.

We got to watch The Avengers preview this morning!  (nah, nah, nah!)  :-)  The movie showed in the Imax theater here.  It was my first movie at this location (we live in Gilbert, if it wasn't for the free preview I would not come this far for a theater).  The theater clearly is not an original IMAX.  Comparing to the one at Arizona Mill makes that clear.  The screen isn't as big, and the seating not as vertical.  But it was a close approximation here at Westgate.  There was plenty of leg room.  If someone needed to get by there was no need to stand up and have your seat retract to let them by.  The seats were comfortable, the sound system was good, and the screen was respectable (smaller than true IMAX, but still very good).  The concession stand is fine.  It would be nice if they offered seasoning for the popcorn.  I've been in several theaters that offer this now, so you can flavor your popcorn to be like kettle corn (for example).  If you get it here, skip the butter.  It's not really butter, and not very good.  At least I didn't like it (and I usually like it).  All in all, a solid theater.  If it were closer I'd come here again.

Keep in mind that this is fast food.  I'm rating it as such.  I'm not comparing it to a place like La Tolteca, or Firebirds, or Top of the Rock.  That would be silly, IMO.  I like Chipotle.  They give you a lot for your money, and it's very tasty.  I can't really say it is authentic, but it's very good.  This time I had a barbacoa, and it was very good.  My wife and I shared it, and we were both full when we were finished.  This is perhaps the best fast food out there.  I don't know (but should probably look up) the "label" to see how much fat and such there is, but their ingredients do appear to be fresh, and the food doesn't sit like a rock in my stomach for hours like a lot of fast food does.  In a hurry and want some good food?  You could do a lot worse than Chipotle.

After surveying the family, we all agreed on 4 stars.  The three of us ordered combo plates.  Chimi, steak picado, and green chile burrito.  The entrees were about the right size.  They skimped on the rice and beans, though.  Probably half the size they should have been.  But the flavors were very nice.  Simple, but good.  The beans tasted "fresh" compared to the glop you get at most Mexican restaurants.  I would still have preferred to substitute them.  Menu says "no substitutions", but maybe that doesn't apply to the rice and beans (I like double-rice).  No chips and salsa, but that's OK.  And the price is definitely right.  Probably 30% less than most other places serving similar food.  And many of them aren't as good!  Oh...and the lemonade is fresh.  Not that Minute Maid swill.  I thought it was very good.  Seating is very limited.  If more than a dozen people show up there will be no place to sit.  We were lucky that they weren't busy when we arrived.  It's a bit far from my usual stomping grounds, but when I'm in the area this will be my choice for Mexican food.

I love Costco.  Good stuff at reasonable prices, plus pharmacy and optical and gas and bakery.  See my other Costco review (from Chandler) for most of my comments.  This store doesn't use the hand scanners I mentioned in the other review, but otherwise it's much the same.  One thing I will note is that their berry smoothie from the lunch counter isn't as "berry" as it used to be.  Not sure if it's just this one, or if it's all Costcos.  But it was not as flavorful as it used to be.  Only accepts American Express, cash, or checks.

The theater was very small.  Screen was small.  Sound was OK.  Seats were fine (they rock a bit).  Like all Harkins they have seasoning for your popcorn.  But this would not be my first choice for a theater.

This is a review of the bakery.  We did not dine here.  We had an event, and needed cookies.  Five-dozen.  They have a reasonable variety of cookies.  It is cheaper to make your own, of course, but these aren't too outrageous.  About $8 for a dozen, and they're reasonably large.  The cookies themselves are pretty good.  Frankly not as good as mine (I just follow the Tollhouse recipe, or whatever...I'm not a master baker by any means!).  But good.  Chocolate chip, sugar, snickerdoodles, and even a lemon cookie.  I also like their muffins.

This is a review of the cafe within this market.  This cafe specializes in numerous Asian dishes.  They have cooked ducks hanging in a display case.  They feature drinks with boba and taro.  A lot of the signs are written in Chinese.  It appears to be fairly authentic.  That said, it didn't look like anything I had when I was in Taiwan.  My wife got a beef-noodle soup.  She seemed to like it.  Our daughter got a chopped beef and rice dish.  It was very fatty.  I don't really like this place.  My wife thinks it is OK, mostly I think because of the drinks (made with taro, melon, boba, and other similar items).  There is no waiter service.  Food usually comes out within 10 minutes.  Not very expensive.  I won't recommend this place.  But if you want some Asian food on the cheap, and aren't too picky about fat, you might like it.  Or find it is adequate.  The market itself is a good Asian market with many authentic items from several countries.  But I'll review that another time.

This is a very nice market.  Their produce is generally very good, and if you ask they will usually cut something open and let you try it.  They have bulk spices, allowing you to get as much or as little as you need.  Same for their bulk grains and nuts.  Their store brand salsa is better than any national brand I can think of.  Their store brand chips are also very good (better than most national brands).  Their meat counter is small, but features all the basics plus a few specialty items.  And many of these meats are "no hormones, no antibiotics" products.  Oh...and on Wednesdays they honor BOTH the previous week's ad and the new week's ad.  We come here almost every week (often on Wednesday!).  It's a very good market.

We continue to come to Sprouts.  There are two convenient to us, and we just go to whichever is closer to our route that day.  Sprouts has changed a bit.  They now have a deli that makes sandwiches, and they've added a soup and an olive bar.  You can actually walk in and order some lunch now.  We've also begun buying most of our meat at Sprouts.  They have regular meat which appears to be like everyone else's, and then they have "organic" which was not given hormones or antibiotics, and their primo stuff is organic AND grass-fed.  Corn is not a natural food for cows, and given enough time it would actually make them sick (though they are slaughtered before that occurs).  The grass-fed is very pricey, so we mostly get the "organic" (including their organic hot dogs).  The produce is still good (and they will cut you a piece of apple or orange or whatever so you can try it for yourself!).  Their "canned" products (salsa, sauces, chips, etc) are generally very good.  Their spice section is nice (they have bulk packaging, but you can spoon-out as much or as little as you want; it's priced by the ounce).  All in all, a very nice market.  We come here (or the one on Val Vista) a lot.

Sprouts remains one of our primary markets.  I come to this one a bit less because it's a bit out of our way, but sometimes it's convenient.  Good produce, good meats, a lot of organic options for those who want them, many of their processed foods (like frozen dinners) have all-natural ingredients...good stuff.  It is smaller than a supermarket, so there is perhaps a bit less variety.  But still plenty of choices to be had.  And if you want to try something (like an apple) to check the quality, just ask.  They'll happily cut one up for you.

This is our favorite Buca, and our favorite Italian restaurant.  The food here is always really good, and the service has always been attentive.  Their pizza (especially the supremo) is the best we've had outside of Italy.  They have numerous pasta dishes that are very good, including their lasagna, baked ziti, chicken rigatoni, and arrabiata.  My wife loves their San Remo too, but I'm not a huge fan (not fond of artichokes).  The decor is a tad obnoxious, but it does give you something to look at while you're waiting for the food.  We will keep coming back to this place as long as the food and service are this good.

It's been a year since my last review.  Yes, I'm still a fan!  Went for lunch today.  They are now offering lunch portions (at lower prices), and honestly they are still pretty huge!  My wife and I were not able to finish either of our dishes.  We each have another meal from the leftovers.  For 99 cents you can add either soup or salad to a lunch entree.  The food is good, the portions are large, and they do a lot of coupons (which make the price quite reasonable).  Without a coupon they are a little expensive, though not outrageous.  Join their e-club and you'll get coupons in email, plus they have them in the paper and sometimes in coupon mailers.  So they aren't difficult to get.  Today I tried their Tuscan bean soup.  I think it would have been good if it weren't so salty.  I mean really salty!  But behind the salt I could taste what seemed like a decent bean soup.  This is the only thing I remember having a problem with at Buca.  But they replaced it with minestrone, and that was pretty good.  We will be back before Sunday as we have a $10 off of $20 purchase email coupon, and we definitely want to use it!!

I haven't been here in a while.  Been trying other places.  But I was pleased to see that despite they being a chain that the food is still good.  The ambiance is unchanged.  Very cluttered.  It's supposed to feel like a basement, and it does.  Service was good.  We built our own pasta dish, which was a nice option.  Their meatballs are enormous.  Nice seasoning, good sauce.  We also had an order of calamari, and they still cook that perfectly.  It's always tender, never chewy.  If you want Italian food Buca continues to be a good option.

This is a good ophthalmic office.  They have a variety of specialists here.  Our child had minor surgery a few years ago, and she's doing fine.  My wife and I come here for full checkups of the eyes.  They check everything, as well as do the refraction.  We've been happy with them.  Sometimes you have to wait, but how many doctors are really punctual?  This visit I got a glasses check.  Prescription felt weird.  They verified the glasses were ground correctly, and then did another refraction on me.  They tweaked the script a bit (not a lot, but what the heck...may as well get it perfect) and wrote a separate script for computer work.  The cool thing there, she dialed in the calculated value (they calculate from your base script), and then fine-tuned it.  Turns out my computer script was significantly different from what is normally calculated.  And all that in a "glasses check".

This is part of India Plaza.  As you would expect, it is an Indian restaurant.  Punjabi, more specifically.  I had heard good things from Indian folks I know, but it took me a while to come in.  First, don't confuse the cafe next door with The Dhaba.  It's all part of the same plaza, same owner.  But the cafe has a much different menu (much simpler).    The Dhaba is relatively small.  Perhaps 10 tables.  Reservations are a good idea if you want to be sure to get a table without waiting.  The ambiance is simple, understated.  The plates and utensils are rather unique.  Metal plates (with some sort of different metal rim piece).  I'm assuming these are traditional.  The menu is quite extensive.  I didn't really know what most of the items were.  There is vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian.  But no beef, which was not really a surprise.  The samosas were very good.  They were served with a chick-pea dip (or soup?), that was also really good.  We played it "safe" and went with vindaloo and tikka masala, and both were excellent also.  My wife did have the mango lasse, and she said it was good but not as good as India Oven.  The rest, however, was better.  The naan bread is not included, you have to order it.  It's good, but I think it should be included as it is in most other Indian restaurants.  Now for the bummer:  the price.  The Dhaba is probably 30% more expensive than the next best Indian restaurant we've found (India Oven).  Maybe 40%.  It was all good, but definitely pricey (despite Yelp's scale being "moderate"...at perhaps $20 per person including tip) compared to others in its category.  If you use "Groupon" they sometimes have one for The Dhaba, and it really helps.  The one I've seen you pay $20 for $40 of food.  We went over $40, and the final bill (after Groupon) was about what I would expect to pay at India Oven.  Is it worth it?  With a Groupon, Yes!  Without, well, that's up to you.  It is really good Indian food.

This is a nice Sprouts.  Clean, friendly staff, good stuff.  It's a bit far from our house, but we were in the area and wanted lunch.  The lunch counter sandwiches were pretty good.  First time I've tried that.  I can definitely recommend.

We've been here several times.  Usually for happy hour, or "reverse" happy hour (after 9pm).  Note that happy hour on Friday does NOT include drink specials, just food (go figure).  One time we ate in the dining room.  This review will be about the happy hour and bar menu.  The food here isn't really authentic Italian.  But it's good.  They're shooting for "high class" while remaining "casual".  We've sampled everything on their bar menu, and it's all good.  The "Brio burgers" are tasty, the flatbread pizzas are almost authentic and pretty good, I didn't really care for the dip but my wife liked it, and the beef on bruschetta is really good.  And you can feed four people for under $20 pretty easily if you are doing happy hour.  The bar area is a little loud, and a bit small.  It can be difficult to see any of their TVs because you have to twist around and/or crane your neck to see.  The booths are about the only places where it's easy to watch, and they only have two of them.  It is not uncommon for the bar area to be full, but they will honor happy hour specials in the outdoor seating accessible from the bar area.

This is not my first time here.  It's kinda cool that they have all-you-can-eat peanuts.  And their bread rolls are really good.  The rest of their food is just average.  Not great, not bad.  I'd probably give 3 stars for the food.  Maybe 2.5 stars (if Yelp allowed).  But they are inconsistent.  This time was particularly bad.  This is the second time we have walked out of here. We sit for a half hour and don't get water or menus.  I ask for them, receive many apologies, and then the server disappears after bringing them.  He did come back after about 60 seconds to see if we had decided, and then was gone for at least 15-20 minutes before I got up and left.    That's right.  Sitting at that table for nearly an hour and getting only water and menus (after asking for them), and never getting even to submit our order.  Never again. Food was always average, but service was either very good or very bad.  This time very (very) bad.  The food certainly isn't good enough to tolerate that.  At least I got some peanuts, otherwise I would have been getting a headache from hunger.

Spotted their van near my office recently, and it just sounded good.  So I pull up Yelp, and apparently most others think it's good!  So it made the list of places to visit.  And today we were nearby, so we stopped in.  As the name implies, they have fried chicken.  They have a few other things, like gumbo, but mostly it's fried chicken.  And it was good fried chicken!  The chicken was crisp and not excessively greasy.  So often fried food is cooked so long that the oil penetrates the food.  But not here.  The breading was crisp and not oily, and the meat was moist and tender.  The breading itself has seasoning that gives it a gentle kick (just a bit of spice, but not really "hot").  The fried okra they apparently buy, but it was good.  So wherever they buy it does a good job.  Their gumbo was a bit soupier than I like, but it was very flavorful and good.  I prefer thicker, but that's just a texture thing.  It was still very good.  And they include dirty rice with it (which also was good).  Probably the only bummer is their "rolls".  They seem like rolls you might buy at the grocery in cellophane bags.  They should probably change those for Southern biscuits.  They'd be a better fit with their cuisine, and probably taste better too.  Seating is limited.

It's difficult to rate the park itself.  I came here for the "Oktoberfest".  I couldn't see much of the park because of all the booths.  I can say that the "Oktoberfest" was utter crap.  I've been to the real one in Munich.  This wasn't even close.  First, "Oktoberfest" is not a carnival.  So what is with those stupid rides?  And when you get a beer, it's in a tiny (TINY!) cup.  The real deal you get a pint.  Sure, it's still over-priced even in Munich.  But at least they give you a decent quantity.  Also, the selection was a joke.  There was Warsteiner (probably the best of the choices), Bud (are you kidding me?), Beck's, and Shock Top.  That's it.  In Munich there are about a dozen halls (I didn't count), each featuring a different brewer.  Here they expected the crowds to get their beer at a counter, which made for huge congestion and crowding.  The proper way is to have everyone sit on the benches (at really long picnic tables) and a bar maid brings you what you want.  Much more efficient that way as there are only bar maids running around instead of hundreds of patrons.  Seriously...the Tempe "Oktoberfest" is a complete waste of time and money.  Will never go again.  I suspect the park itself might be nice if it's not shoulder-to-shoulder full of people and booths selling junk food.

We have been Costco members for a long time.  We had no idea these "business centers" existed.  There aren't very many of them.  This is the one (and only) in Phoenix.  And this was our first visit.  First, the place is huge.  Probably about 50% larger than a normal Costco.  They have a lot of the same stuff here.  There's also a lot of stuff they don't have that you'll find in the normal Costcos.  But there is a LOT of stuff here that you wont' find in the regular warehouses.  I can't even begin to list them all.  Baking sheets of various sizes, silicone baking mats, rolls of butcher paper, thermometers and temperature probes, large packs of office supplies (pens, reams of paper), etc.  Clearly catering to various small businesses.  And then there's the food.  Huge bags of onions and potatoes, cases of mushrooms (sliced or whole), 40 lb packs of chicken breasts (boneless, skinless, great price...we grabbed one because we have a freezer!), cryovac packs of beef neck, beef shoulder, pork shoulder...10 lbs, 20 lbs, more.  You want a whole halal lamb?  They have them.  This place may not be suitable for everyone, but I can definitely see coming here every month or two for some of the meats, the prepared frozen items, and the sodas.  Yes, the sodas.  They have several varieties available you don't find in other stores, plus other beverages also.  No alcohol, but who cares.  Half-liter bottles of Coke made with real sugar.  My wife picked up a case of mango sodas.  I have little doubt this is where some Mexican restaurants get these sodas.  Like all Costcos they accept the American Express card, and this one has a gas station.  I didn't see a pharmacy or optical center.

Less than a week before our daughter was due to leave for college she drops her phone on a concrete floor.  Shattered Nexus screen. They had one in stock and it was ready after a few hours. Phone works now, and daughter is off to college.  Replacing a screen isn't cheap, but it is cheaper than a new phone.  And the phone is like new now, so we have a happy daughter.  Not much more to say.  They do a good job, and they do it relatively quickly.  This is my go-to phone repair shop now.

Manager lady is brusque and annoying. Wait staff seems friendly and eager. Wide selection of dishes, plus daily specials.  We ordered the "gang pang" chicken (seriously...that's the name... ;-), and the szechuan chicken.  Both were listed with the red chile warning icon (spicy!!).  But neither was spicy.  Or at least not much.  And the flavor was OK...not great...just OK.  If you're looking for some fast Chinese take-out, this is adequate I guess.  Nothing special.  Dining in you just get to pay for drinks and a tip, so why bother?  There's a place on Alma School at Elliot that's better (China Way) if you want Chinese food.  If we eat here again (unlikely), I'll update this with opinions about whatever we order (won't be szechuan or gang pang!).  Maybe some of their other dishes are better.

We've been to the Grimaldi's in Chandler.  Great pizza there.  We had high expectations when we came to this one in Gilbert, and we were not disappointed!  We were greeted promptly when we arrived.  I suppose I could ding them for telling us it was a 15 minute wait and then seating us in 5 minutes, but that's a positive error so I'd feel odd doing it!  The server was very friendly, and even offered to serve up the first slice when the pizza came.  She did well.  The pizza was hot, fresh, and very good.  This place is a tad pricey, though if you have a coupon that can help.  A great pizza with excellent service.  No complaints.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a great pizza.

This is just an update to my older review.  Grimaldi's continues to be one of the best pizzas in town.  Judging by the crowd waiting to be seated I apparently am not the only one who knows this!  Probably about a 30 minute wait.  As usual, the pizza was very good.  We also ordered an antipasto plate, and it was very nice too.  The server was friendly, but a little slow.  Probably because they were full.  Not an empty table (which is why there was a wait!).  This is still my favorite pizza place (outside of Florence, Italy...but this is a lot closer).

We've done happy hour here several times.  The appetizers they prepare are generally pretty good.  Today we ate lunch.  This review is only for lunch.  The chicken parmesan sandwich was mediocre.  The chicken was overcooked, the marinara was very mild, and the breading had no seasoning.  Definitely skip this one if you come here.    My wife had a sausage pasta dish that was pretty good.  I could see ordering that one again.  Service was adequate.  Not as attentive as it should have been, but adequate.

It's been a long time since I reviewed here.  But we decided to head over for the "tapping" of the new Trippel.  Well, that was the first problem.  All this hooplah over the tapping, and then they don't even have a party.  They used to do parties for the tapping.  Everyone would get a free glass of the new beer (not a tiny glass, a full-sized glass!), and there were some food samples, etc.  Not this time.  You had to ASK about the Trippel, and then they gave you a tiny little glass about the size of two shot glasses.  We were in time for "happy hour" so we ordered a few "sliders" (French dip and brats), and my wife had the roasted vegetable salad and I had the tuna plate.  All on the happy hour menu.  For the price charged the portions were ridiculous.  In fact, most of the happy hour pricing is silly.  $9 for the sliders??  With three potato chips??!  Not much of a discount!  The food itself was pretty good.  Not spectacular, but pretty good.  I didn't try the salad, but my wife liked it.  We both liked the French dip and the brats, and the tuna was nice.  But it was too expensive for the quantity.  Also, our server (Rhiannon) was really good.  Very personable, reasonably efficient.  The food was three stars, and the service was four.  But the value just is not there.  Overall, I'd say "skip it".  We mostly stopped coming here for ordinary meals and happy hours because it was nothing special and poor value, and if they aren't even going to have a party for their "tapping" (that they trumpet in their emails) then there's really no reason to come here at all.  You can get comparable food -and more of it- for less at other places.

Safeway is expensive.  It just is.  But they often have good sales.  The produce is generally pretty good (though we prefer Sprouts' produce generally), the meats are generally good, and their deli area is really good.  Their soups and chili are probably the best of all the grocery stores.  They sell them either hot , or pre-packed in a refrigerator.  The chili has a lot of meat, and is very flavorful without being salty.  Their deli sandwiches are pretty good, too.  This particular location is clean and the employees are friendly and helpful.

Safeway has become our primary grocery store (except maybe for Sprouts).  We mostly shop their Club Card special using their phone app.  Prices are competitive with others (and sometimes better!).  And I like the gas rewards.  Pretty good produce and meats.  Their "Open Nature" line is mostly all-natural and some good stuff.  And of course the usual stuff you'd expect in a grocery.  Each Safeway is a little different.  This is a good one.  I like the one in Ocotillo, but I don't get down that far south very often.

I should be up-front and say I don't like massage.  It hurts me.  A lot.  I do not find it relaxing.  For me it's about fixing problems, working out problems.  I do massage in conjunction with chiropractic to try to stay pain-free in my daily life.  So we decided to try this place.  One nice thing up-front is that they don't do the contract thing.  I hate that.  I don't want a monthly charge whether I go or not, and having to give notice if I want to stop (and I have to go at least a year before I can stop).  Touch of Tranquility does NOT do that.  So that's a plus right there.  The massage itself is tricky.  First, it likely will depend on whom you get.  My massage therapist was fine.  She asked several times if I was "OK", because it does hurt.  Even though I specified neck and shoulders and back, she did spend time on my legs which I thought was pointless.  My problems are always neck, back, and shoulders.  Next time I'll be more definitive to ignore everything else.  I'll go 4 stars this time, but after another visit or two I may revise.  I haven't decided yet if this is my new massage place, but it might be.

At last...  My wife is Filipina.  I get Filipino food pretty regularly, and it's good stuff.  Until this place the only other decent Filipino food has been all the way in L.A.  All the other places in the Phoenix area that I've tried were mediocre or even bad.  And there aren't that many places here!!  We happened to be on the west side, and I knew about this place so I decided we should try it.  We had a variety of dishes, all of them authentic, and all of them good.  I did think the Bicol Express had a bit too much shrimp paste (bagoong) in it, at least compared to the one my sister-in-law made once when I was visiting the Philippines.  It was still good, but just a bit too strong.  It covered the other flavors.  If they fixed that and gave slightly larger portions I might even go 5 stars.  We had the Bicol express, sinigang, a soup I don't remember the name of, and a curry (which wasn't really Filipino, IMO, but was still good).  We don't come this far west often, but next time we do I think we'll return here.  It's nice to get some dishes my wife doesn't make often, or even just give her a break (since she's the only one who can cook this stuff at home!).  It's definitely a treat for her, and that's what matters.  I look forward to trying some of their other offerings.  Don't know if I'd come here at night.  The plaza looked bleak and I'm not sure how the neighborhood is.  But for lunch, no problem.

This is one of my favorite "shows" on the Strip.  During the day it's boring.  But at night when they light it up it's really beautiful.  No naked girls or anything like that.  Just "dancing" waters moving with the music.  And it's free to anyone who just walks by.

This is a pretty small farmer's market.  Actually not that much produce (I expected more).  Just one large table, really.  Several people selling prepared hot foods, and a few selling oils, spices, etc.  Prices weren't really very good, selection wasn't much.  It's almost more like a fair than a farmer's market.  I don't see the point going here again.

It's a burger joint!  They have other stuff (like chicken sandwiches and "melts" and hot dogs), but it's basically a burger joint.  They have a counter you can sit at, or you can get a table.  They play mostly "oldies", and for a nickel you can pick what is playing.  If the mood strikes them, the staff will get out and dance to the tune!  It's loud here, but a lot of fun also.  The french fries are ordinary.  Generally served very hot (usually a good idea to wait a couple of minutes before biting).  Nothing wrong with the fries, just nothing special either.  They are thicker than what you get at McD's or BK or one of those places.  Fries are "bottomless".  You can get as many refills as you can eat.  The burgers are hot and fresh.  No heat lamps are evident.  Very tasty.  Nothing extremely special about them (it's a burger), but it is good.  Their dark chocolate shake is what a shake should be.  Costs about twice what it should, but it is sooooooo good.  Sometimes I come here just for the shake.  One of the better burger diners around.  I prefer them to Fatburger (which I also like).  If you want a good burger don't go to McD's, come here.  It's pricier, but so much better there isn't really a comparison.  And it's more fun, too.  The manager (and most of the staff) do a good job of being up-beat and excited, helping the "fun" and "friendly" atmosphere.

It's been a while so I thought I would update my review.  As I said last time, it's a burger joint.  Burger and fries is what they do best, and they do it pretty well.  Burgers taste fresh.  Good shakes, too.  Obviously I'm not rating this against a place like Vintage 95!!  For a burger joint they are very good.  The place is loud, and they play lots of oldies (which I like).  And every so often you will lose your server as they get out and do a dance for the customers.  It's fun.  Service is usually very good also.

It's been less than a year since my last review, but with such a large change in performance I decided I should note it.  In the past I was always happy with this place.  They're just a burger joint, but there were a good burger joint.  And fun.  Dancing, ketchup drawings, etc.  I always rated them well.  Not this time.  I always order a burger here.  That's what they do, right?  So my burger comes out...first I asked for a double patty, but didn't get it.  They offered to re-do it, but I just emphasized they better not charge me for the double.  Which they didn't.  The burger itself didn't seem as if it just came off the griddle.  Not piping-hot.  The French fries were just sad.  They were warm, not hot, and no subtle 'crunch'.  They were not fresh from the oil, they'd been sitting a while.    And they no longer have the dark chocolate shake!!!  Just the Hershey's regular chocolate shake.  That was something I always looked forward to here, and now it's gone!  I can get a burger anywhere, it was the combination of the burger with the dark chocolate shake that kept me coming back.  My wife thought the brisket tots looked good (and the picture DID look good!).  Well, it was nasty.  The brisket bits were sliced like bacon, were only slightly more tender than jerky, and there wasn't very much brisket.  The dish was mostly tots, and they were covered with this semi-congealed gunk that was supposed to be a cheese sauce.  Very poor performance (1-star for this one!).  And then the staff didn't dance once while we were there.  I know they have work to do, but in the past we've always had at least one (and often two) dances during the time it takes to dine here.  Not tonight.  No dark chocolate shake, no hot-fresh fries, one completely nasty entree, and not even the fun atmosphere...one more visit like this and I'm never coming back.  There are too many other choices to put up with this.

This HD is very good.  They seem to have knowledgeable people.  When I was putting in my irrigation system a while back I got a lot of good info from their plumbing guy.  Apparently he was a master plumber.  On this trip I needed a overheat sensor for a can light.  The lighting guy had a can he said he couldn't sell because it was missing something, and proceeded to rip the sensor out for me.  No charge.  That's customer service!

Eh. It's OK. Not great, not bad. Uninspired.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich.  Hard to mess that up.  It was fine.  No seasoning, though.  No evidence it was marinated.  Nothing.  Just grilled.  My wife had the chicken wings.  She wasn't impressed.  Normally she loves this sort of thing, but these she says weren't that good.  Service was fine.  Lots of TVs to watch whatever sports may be going on at the time.  I can't really recommend them.  "Meh" covers it.  Not really bad, but not particularly good either.  You could do much better without having to drive too much further.

First...it's a burger joint.  As with other of my reviews, the star rating here takes into consideration what the place is.  It is not Top of the Rock, or Delmonico's or anything like that.  It's a burger place.  And the burgers are very good.  You can get a variety of preparations (teriyaki, bleu, A1, etc), or just get a regular burger.  The service has always been friendly, they offer bottomless fries with many menu choices, and the burgers are reasonable size.  Or if you want chicken, they have that too.  I have been here a few times and always get the burger.  Today was the A1 burger, and it was pretty good.  Their fries are bland (just a bit of salt), but the seasoning bottle on the table makes them really tasty.  Four of us ate for right at $50, which included one float and one large shake (which also was pretty good).  Generally, if I want a burger and don't feel like doing it myself, this is where I come.  They do a good job, and the endless fries are a nice bonus.

We really don't come here often.  It's a burger joint.  I can do burgers at home.  Plus it's a chain which I try to avoid most of the time.  But it was late, we had a coupon offer, and a burger sounded good.  So we decided to show-up.  As this is a burger joint I will rate it accordingly.  I will not compare it to Vintage 95.  This is a place to get a burger, maybe a salad, a brew if you are so inclined.  Nothing fancy.  They have several variants on the burger.  You can get a classic burger (with the usual onion, tomato, lettuce), a chili burger (great if you want people to avoid you for the next few hours!!), a mushroom burger, a BBQ burger, a bleu cheese burger, etc, etc.  All of these feature endless fries.  I like that.  They just keep bringin' them fries!!  Service was fine.  They could have been a bit more on-their-toes about refilling fries, but it wasn't too bad.  Burger was cooked properly and tasty.  I like using their house seasoning (in a shaker bottle) on the fries.  If you're gonna go to a chain to get a burger, this is probably one of the better places to go.  For what it is the food is good and the service is fine.  And bottomless fries is ALWAYS good.  :-)

This Lenscrafters is a bit hit-or-miss.  Sometimes I go in for an adjustment and they do a great job, other times I end up with the nose pads causing pain.  This visit seemed to go well.  No far the adjustment seems to have been good.  If you are getting new glasses their selection seems more limited than some of the other locations.  If this one is closer it's worth a try to see if they can help you.

Actually, my wife is the fan.  I'm not a clothes person.  If it fits, is simple and comfortable...I'm good.  I don't go for fashion at all.  But my wife seems to like the fashion here, and she especially likes the numerous sales they have.  The staff is busy, but tries to be helpful.

As the name implies, this is a sub shop.  They have a variety of hot and cold subs, some traditional and some not-so-traditional.  You can get an Italian (cold cuts), meatball, Philly, and several more. So far all the ones I have tried are good.    They only have "white" or "wheat" bread, compared to others who have four or more choices.  Their bread holds up better than Subway's bread (don't know why, but Subway bread seems to turn to mush pretty quickly).  They are pricier than Subway, but they are worth the difference.  And their staff was very friendly and helpful.  One thing you have to know is that after you pay you will probably have to wait about 5-10 minutes for them to bring the sandwich to you.  They make each one fresh, and custom to your order.  As near as I can tell they even slice the meat themselves after you place your order.  Unlike most places that have little bins of prepared ingredients.  So it does take a little longer.  They are popular enough that sometimes they do get busy, and the line can get long.  It's because lots of people seem to like their subs.  But it also means a longer wait if you hit them during a rush.  I try to time it a bit early (maybe 11:15 am), or a bit late (maybe 12:30-1pm).  If you try to go 11:30-12 you are likely to hit the lunch rush.

We really like this store.  It's not as big as a Safeway or Basha's, but they have a good variety of products.  Some of their store brand items (like their chocolate fudge cake) are really good.  We sometimes get their prepared meals.  The "Chinese" meals aren't very good, but many of the others are quite tasty.  Their breads are also very good (I love their whole grain hamburger buns).  The staff is generally friendly and helpful, and their meats are fresh.

It's been a while so I thought I would update my review.  I still like this store.  It's a very nice store with nice employees.  The fresh bakery has, unfortunately, gone downhill.  Initially I really liked their pastries such as their chocolate croissants.  But lately their pastries seem less tasty.  They seem to be using less chocolate, less cinnamon in their cinnamon pastries, etc.  Very disappointing.  Their loaf breads are good, though.  Their other products are still good in general.  I still give them 4 stars.

Where do I begin?  Long ago I remember "Tom's BBQ" at Alma School and Warner.  It was decent.  Until San Tan BBQ came to town it was my favorite.  (Then San Tan closed and I discovered Joe's!!)  Tom's long-since left the place I remember.  Well, we were in the area of Chandler Heights and Gilbert tonight and thought "why not?".  So we stopped in.  After all, Yelp showed 3 stars.  When we entered the place was packed.  Good sign, I'm thinking.  We were seated promptly, and the waitress came by quickly.  She wasn't much for chatting, but she was friendly and professional.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, my wife had the brisket sandwich.  We were very surprised how quickly the food came.  We both tried our beans first.  They were...OK.  Not really good, but not really bad either.  I removed the top bun because it seemed so small, but the meat was piled respectably thick.  Fine.  Put the bun back and take a bite.  This is where it goes wrong.  The meat was very tender.  That's about the best I can say about it.  The sauce was like a generic grocery store sauce.  Not bad, but not really good.  The meat seemed like it had been boiled, and then some sort of smoke flavor added.  It was nasty.  The "smoke" flavor was not right, and not good.  Almost like a burned flavor, but not quite that either.  The after-taste of that flavor lingered about an hour after we left.  (What is that?!)  Compare and contrast to either Dave's or Joe's (both of which are good, though Joe's is much better).  My wife's brisket sandwich was no better.  Well, maybe a little better.  She said it also seemed like it had been boiled, but there was no smoke flavor at all (so she didn't have to deal with the after-taste like I did).  She was, however, a bit nauseated until after we got home.  I understand...my stomach felt like I had just had a Big Mac (that always leaves me a little queasy with the feeling of a rock in my stomach).  It was further, but we should have gone to Liberty Market instead.  We thought about it, almost did it, but this was closer.  Bad choice.  Never again.

It's been a while since we came here.  We used to really like this place.  We happened to be in the area, and so we thought "let's drop in!".  I don't know what happened.  Maybe a different chef?  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  My wife complained her basil chicken was too salty.  And even though I ordered medium spice, my curry wasn't hot at all.  It was also very soupy.  Not nearly enough chicken and vegetables.  Service also was indifferent.  It used to be a husband/wife.  I'd never seen this girl before, and she was not very attentive.  Kinda sad.  Finding good Thai food is difficult (I've actually been to Thailand).  This place was one of the better ones, but not this visit.

Been here before.  First time (a few years ago) was pretty good.  Last experience wasn't great.  Seems like each visit is worse than the last.  Gave them one more try.   Service was brusque. Flavors were mediocre, most dishes too sweet.  Not coming back.  Not much more to say.

This one will be short.    We were shopping and on impulse stopped in here for a smoothie.  They had an ad in the window for a free smoothie with the purchase of a $25 gift card.  Cool, right?  Well, they said they didn't have any gift cards.  Annoying.  I don't want to say "bait and switch", but really??  Then we decided we wanted the next larger size cup.  You'd think they'd be happy to do that, right?  Wrong.  Already made the smoothie in the smaller cup.  Can't you just put that in a bigger cup and top it off?  No.  Yes, I'm serious.  It's ridiculous.  No attempt to accommodate us at all.  The smoothie itself was OK.  Not great, but not bad.  But the customer service really sucked, and no evidence the girl was at all sorry about it.  She can't claim to have been rushed because there was only one other person in line.  Not going back.  Too many other options for our impulse snacking dollars.

This company manufactures and installs garage cabinets.  Tom (one of the owners, the other is Deidre who handles most of the phone and email contact) came out, measured our space, designed our cabinets on the spot, and gave us a quote.  We exchanged a few emails asking questions (like how much to get handles, getting them to drop off color samples, etc), we decided to go with them.  They were able to schedule us within 5 days of our finalizing.  Paul (he makes and installs the cabinets) showed up and got the cabinets installed in one day.  He had to improvise a few things on the fly (e.g. making sure our 220V outlet was accessible, plus an obstruction Tom hadn't accounted for).  There were a few things Paul wasn't happy about that he pointed out to me, and he arranged to come back to take care of them.  He didn't even take payment then.  He came back, addressed them, and we paid in full at that time.  After about two weeks something apparently shifted or settled so that one door didn't close properly, and Paul came back and fixed it (plus replaced a door he didn't like because it was bowing).  I really liked how easy this was, and how conscientious Paul was.  The cabinets look great.  So in the "pro" column I have to put how easy the process was, the conscientiousness of the installer, and the service after the install.  They claim if we ever have any problems to give them a call and they'll handle it.  The only "cons" I have are regarding the actual materials.  But it is important to understand that everyone uses these same materials.  So it's not a problem unique to AGS.  The doors are a laminated particle board, and only the surfaces visible from the outside are laminated.  The inner surfaces are exposed particle board.  They should have had an option to laminate the inner surfaces too (it would protect them better from moisture).  Though I would have preferred a marine plywood that could be stained and sealed (and, if Tom and Deidre are reading this, I would recommend that option be made available with whatever up-charge is appropriate)  The shelves are a "press board" (actually high-density fiber board).  Very strong, heavy, not laminated or coated.  Plywood shelves would be lighter, probably thinner for the same strength, and again could be sealed if the customer wanted.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of particle board.  But, as I said, everyone does it this way.  So I can't single out AGS for this.  If they had offered those options I mentioned I would have given them 5 stars, because everything else about the experience (at least so far) has been great.

This is an Asian market.  They specialize in foods and ingredients from countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, etc.  They have a large variety of rices (generally in large bags), various fruits and vegetables not normally found in American groceries, many prepared foods, seasoning packs, and much more.  If you need fish sauce, they have it here.   Their meat section is unique also.  You want frog?  Chicken's feet?  Duck heads?  Yes, they also have more typical poultry, pork and beef.  Plus some very specific frozen items such as fish balls, siopao buns, red bean ice cream, and more.  The smell of the store is a bit off-putting initially, but you get used to it very quickly.  Whether you want to cook your own Asian dishes, or if you just want pre-prepared sauces and seasonings, they probably have it.

Mekong is a little further than I like to go, but we still come here ever couple of months.  Lee Lee used to be our primary Asian market, but their selection seems to be declining.  We'll still go there, but if they continue having problems they may not last much longer.  In which case we'll have no choice but to drive the extra several miles to come here.  Mekong is the anchor store in the Mekong Plaza.  Lots of eateries and a few shops here.  The supermarket is well-stocked with Asian-oriented produce, an extensive fish counter (including live fish), and a meat counter.  Plus aisle after aisle of various Asian goods including rice noodles, seasonings, various canned things most Americans wouldn't recognize, snacks, drinks, etc.  Like an Asian Safeway.  Pricing is competitive, and there aren't many places you can obtain some of these items.  Aisles are more narrow than conventional grocery stores, and sometimes they are made more narrow with boxes of product (often unopened boxes) stacked in places.  For Asian foods and fish this is probably the best place in the Phoenix area now.

First visit here.  As usual I order the chimi on a first visit to a Mexican place.  It was fine.  Not great, but not bad.  I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't make a point of visiting again either.  Service was fine (perhaps a little slow).  Food was OK.  Chips were fresh (warm), which I like.  Salsa was fine (nothing special).    Really rates 2.5 stars, but I don't have that option.  And it's not worthy of 3.

I like Harkins.  The seats are comfortable.  I kinda wish the screen was bigger.  And something about the surround sound just doesn't seem right, but I can't put my finger on it.  But it's still better than any other theater in this area.  Each row of seats is enough higher than the one in front that it would take a VERY tall person to block the view of another patron.  In some theaters that is not true.  Overall, a nice theater.  One thing I will slam them for is their ticket price.  $9.50?  Really?  I know they all are this expensive now, which is why we don't go to the theater much.  For three of us (two adults, one student) it's $26.  I can buy the DVD for that (BluRay!) and watch it as much as I want.  But when we get passes at the office, for example, we do like this theater.

I like the clothing here.  I'm not a big fan of having a store's name plastered across my body in 4" lettering.  They do have some of that here, but they also have some nice stuff with a small eagle logo.  Simple, understated, and nice.  And the quality seems better than some of their competitors (especially that French-sounding competitor that really loves the 4" lettering on practically everything they sell).  Come during a sale and you'll get a good deal on decent clothing.  They have everything from jeans that look like they're ready for the rubbish bin (I know holes in jeans are fashionable again, but they still look like they're ready to be tossed if you ask me!), to nice collared shirts you could wear to work or a  nice evening out.  Nothing formal, but most everything else from grunge to office casual.  If you buy clothes anticipating to toss them in a few months because you've already worn them a few times and want something "different", the quality here probably won't matter to you.  If you plan to wear it for a few years, the quality here should be a major consideration for you, in my opinion.  I just wish they had a nice wallet on this visit...I'm looking for one...[sigh]

Ummmmm....yuck.  Just "yuck".  I mean, seriously?  I give it one star because the waitress was nice and we got good service.  We were here last week.  Wife got her birthday "grand slam".  OMG...I don't know what they did but it was disgusting.  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and, well, just "yucky".  They should have been "light and fluffy", as most breakfast places will make them.  Eggs weren't a lot better.  I wouldn't be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life.  It was free for her birthday, and I still think we got ripped off on that one!  I had a burger and fries.  Well...they were better than McDonald's.  Can't say they were bad.  But definitely nothing special.  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about 10 minutes for a fraction of the cost.  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that.  For the price, Denny's burger was definitely not worth it.  I don't care if it's free on your birthday, it's not worth it.  Don't come here.

Well, it was someones birthday. So I ended up here again.   The slam still didn't look very good, but I had the Santa Fe skillet, and it was very tasty.  The kid enjoyed her chicken fried steak.  And my wife seemed to like her "Hobbit Hole" (yeah, Tolkien themed food...).   And the service was friendly and reasonably good.  So I must amend my previous review.  This was a three star visit.   Maybe 2.5 (like I said, the 'slam' still didn't look appetizing to me).  I can definitely recommend the Santa Fe skillet if you come here.  Though it's still not my first choice of places to come, frankly.  But if you order the right things you certainly could do much worse than this place.

Yes, it's been a year (or more?), but I'm here again.  Late night at work, late from the gym, and hungry.  With most places closed or closing.  And we had a coupon for Denny's.  It's a diner.  A mediocre diner, but a diner.  The service was good.  Looking at my past reviews that seems to be a constant.  I decided to try something different.  Not a burger.  Not a chicken-fried steak.  I got this chicken skillet thing.  It wasn't fancy.  Some sauteed vegetables and potatoes (maybe even pan-fried) and a few pieces of boneless chicken.  It was tine.  I thought the flavor was nice.  Nothing special, but nice.  We then opted for the "sundae".  It was three scoops of ice cream with chocolate syrup and crumbled oreos.  It wasn't as good as it sounds.  It was OK.  Not bad.  But not as good as it sounds like it should be.

This place is awesome.  It's a one-stop shop for all your pediatric needs. You can stop reading right there if you want because that sums it up.  We have a teenage girl.  It's pretty silly that "adult" doctors won't see her until she's 18 because in every other way except the calendar she's an adult.  Fortunately they have a pediatric gynecologist here at PCH.  Her pediatrician recommended she come here to consult about occasionally-severe dysmenorrhea.  She said Dr Williamson was great, so we made the appointment.  Well, Dr Williamson was great.  She communicated very well with our daughter (communicating with a teen is an art form!), and was very thorough.  She asked lots of questions, did a lot of poking and feeling ("does this hurt?"), and then had her last blood-work forwarded to her office.  After examining the results she ordered the tests she felt were missing, wrote a prescription for hormone pills (low-dose oral contraceptive; in this case it should smooth-out the hormones to reduce or eliminate the 'cramps', will help with acne, and of course it will prevent pregnancy).  She spent a LOT of time with us.  None of that hurrying out the door nonsense you get with a lot of doctors.  She was great!  Then we were able to get the blood-draw and the prescription filled in the next-door building on the PCH campus.  So we were able to get everything taken care of in one trip.  It's inconvenient for us to come here because we live in Gilbert, but we will be coming back.  Dr Williamson and the PCH are worth the trip.

This is a smaller store, but the staff was quick to ask if I needed help, and then took me right to what I was looking for.  Not as much variety as the big box home improvement stores, but they have stuff the big boxes don't (like the item I was looking for).  And although the store is small, if you spot an item online you can have it shipped to the store for free and just pick it up there.

This is one of the larger tile stores around.  Various kinds of tile (ceramic, porcelain, travertine, and even slate.  Prices are reasonable, a moderately large selection.  Staff is VERY busy but helpful when you can get one.  We ended up buying our tile from them for this latest project.

This is one of the few CVS pharmacies that carries Pepsi Throwback (with REAL SUGAR!!).  I would come here just for that.  They don't always have it, but are more likely than most to get some.  Their CVS generic medications are fine, and obviously cheaper than name brands (with the same active ingredients!).  Their staff, including the pharmacy staff, are generally friendly and helpful.  All-in-all a good pharmacy.

Well, after 3 weeks there is some improvement noted.  It's not "cured", but no one expected it that quickly.  However, the pain is not as frequent and the "good" periods are longer and more frequent.  Hopefully the podiatrist will recommend continuing the treatment.  They have a variety of equipment and techniques to handle the various problems we've seen while ours is being treated.

This is a large Basha's.  Feels bigger than "normal", but maybe it isn't.  As is typical with Basha's, they have a good variety of stuff.  Produce is usually good.  Meat is usually good.  One nice thing is that they are a local chain instead of a national one.  There are benefits to the community to keep money local.

We've used SimonMed on two different occasions, and both were satisfactory.  On this occasion my mother-in-law needed some scans.  They were handled quickly with no hassles or problems.  We haven't seen the results of the scans  yet.  If we have to go back because they messed up something I will update this, but otherwise it went fine.

We didn't purchase anything today.  But the staff was very friendly, helpful, and didn't mind explaining about the different shoes (like MBT).  Not cheap, but good quality stuff.  You mostly don't find Skechers or other cheap stuff here.  I can foresee buying shoes here in the future.

As the name implies, this is a shoe store.  But not a Payless Shoe Source store where everything is cheap excrement made by slave labor in China.  No no!  The shoes here are, almost without exception, good for your feet.  They are actually designed to deal with neuromas, plantar's fasciitis, pronation, supination, etc.  And a lot of those problems arise when people buy the junk at cheap shoe stores and wear them.  After 20 years of that your feet will hate you, and when your feet hate you things get really bad.  You suffer.  So now we get most of our shoes here.  Sales are best, of course, so it pays to check them out around obvious sale times (Labor Day, etc).  But even at full price it's small compared to the relief from foot pain.  And unlike most shoe stores, the sales people here know their stuff!  We had concerns about a shoe we ordered from their website.  James knew about the shoe, and explained why it wasn't the correct choice for my wife.  He then brought us the correct choice which she tried on.  Seemed better, so we were able to exchange them straight up.  The price was the same, so zero balance.  Trust me...take care of your feet and get good shoes.  If you're still pain-free after 20 years you can thank me then.  Problem is people don't realize it until they already are in pain.  They never think about it in their younger years when they feel fine.  But when you get older and things start to hurt you kick yourself for being stupid all those years before.  I speak from experience.  I can spare you that.  Come in and talk to James, and he'll get you squared away with shoes that will help your feet feel better and stay feeling better.

Let me start this with a 'tip'.  If you get a coupon from either Groupon or "Living Social", you save a LOT.  Yes, this place is expensive.  But when you get the "deal" the cost falls into the same range as other car washes.  This was my first visit here.  I did get the Living Social deal.  When I pulled-up a young man walked over and explained their system (I was going to go inside and ask since I had the coupon deal thing).  You pick your wash (my coupon picked that for me), your scent and then go inside to the register.  Inside I could see how the wash worked, and I liked it.  There are no spinning brushes or flopping strips of material.  There are arches with sprayers, and as the car goes under each it gets wet, then soaped, then rinsed, and probably a spray wax too.  In between each arch are people washing by hand.  So after you get soap they move in and work the soap in by hand.  I lost sight of it after the rinse, so not sure about the spray wax.  Next the vehicle is taken to a finishing station outside where they vacuum it, do the windows, dry it off (blowing compressed air into all the crevices to get out all the water), and then they put something on the plastic pieces and dashboard to make them shiny.  Given the amount of by-hand labor involved, the pricing isn't too bad here.  All the cheaper places have spinning brushes and such (hope you remembered to take down your antenna!).  If anyone does anything by hand it's only the finishing at the end.  But Classic Car Spa is all by hand, so you should expect to pay a bit more.  When it was done the car seemed clean.  They did it reasonably quickly, and I haven't found anything that they missed.  My coupon gives me two more washes, and I will be using them happily.

A bit pricy, but they keep a record of what you like so they can do it consistently. Seems to work well.  The girls are always friendly, and they usually offer you a bottle of water or a soda.  I'm a regular at this point.  Coupons help, plus they have a punch card you can redeem when you fill it up.

I took my wife here for a cut.  She didn't want a fancy style, and she is not one to pay $100 for a salon.  We spotted this place and decided to give it a shot.  My wife was really happy with the result, and the price was not unreasonable (which made her even happier).  We'll be coming back.  I may even get MY hair cut here (it's getting close to time!).

It's fried chicken.  KFC.  I haven't been in a long time, but we had a coupon and fried chicken sounded good.  Well, the original recipe wasn't what I remembered.  A lot of pepper, which I didn't mind, but I don't remember that from my youth.  The breading seemed a bit soggy.  We also got some extra crispy, and it was better.  Nice seasoning, and not at all soggy.  It was good.  The potato wedges were fine.  As were the beans.  The corn was not as firm as it should have been, but not bad.  One annoyance was that condiments and utensils are behind the counter instead of accessible by the patrons.  So I had to wait around for the people behind the counter to get them for me.  They weren't ignoring me, they were just busy.  But it was still annoying.

Quick, efficient, and they do it right.  There's not much more I can ask of an imaging facility.  On this occasion they did an x-ray.  Good pictures first time.  Wait was short (x-rays are walk-in only).  I would return here.

This used to be Thai pots. Menus still have that name on them. Family owned, and as near as I can tell only family works there.  They need to control their kid better (or just leave him home - occasionally he was cute trying to show people to tables, but mostly he wandered around staring at people and moving chairs; I'm sure he was bored out of his mind).   We showed up for lunch.  $8 lunch special. Nice decor (much better than the original Thai Pots).  Staff was friendly.  We placed our order.  They didn't ask about spice level.  They rank 1-10 (with 10 being Thai-hot, a.k.a. please-kill-me-now).  Before he walked away I said "six for mine!".  Shortly after a spicy soup arrived.  They didn't identify it, but it might have been tom-yum.  It was mostly broth with a few bits of vegetables in it.  But it was tasty.  Then the main courses arrived.  Presentation was nice.  Rice was ample (and it turns out you can get more for free, unlike some places!).  And it had an egg roll...yes, an egg roll.  Even tasted like an egg roll.  Pretty sure that isn't really Thai.  But anyway...the food was very good.  Portion sizes were reasonable.  My "six" didn't seem like "six" to me, but at least it wasn't "one".  One bummer...no brown rice.  I don't eat white rice much anymore (or JASMINE rice, as the owner proudly proclaimed...with cause, since Jasmine is probably the best of the white rices).  I just prefer brown now, but no such option here.  Still, it was very good and reasonably priced.  And the ambiance is much better than the old Thai Pots.  You could easily miss this place...next to the Goodwill drop-off, sign difficult to see if you aren't right in front of it.  But it would be a shame to miss it because this is some of the best Thai food in the east valley.

Unusual for us to end up in this area, but we were and we were hungry.  I spotted this on Yelp, and noted generally good reviews.  So we drove over.  When we entered the place looked kinda divey.  But the smells were good!   The host was friendly and helpful.  We almost went for a roti, but it's hard for me to judge a place based on a dish I've never had.  So we got a curry chicken and a jerk chicken.  Then we opted to sit at an outside table.  We also ordered a fruit smoothy (mango and banana, I think).  While I didn't order one, I noted several unique sodas were available too..  The food was VERY good.  The curry was a yellow curry, and very nice.  It was mostly chicken and potatoes (I like carrots in my yellow curry also, but that's minor).  The jerk chicken was very well done.  Strong jerk flavor with just a bit of heat (note that my idea of "hot" is hotter than the average person, but I'm still a wimp compared to a Thai person).  Both dishes were served with a rice/bean combo (i.e. not rice AND beans, but rice&beans).  It was very good too.  The mango cheesecake was excellent.  All in all, a great meal.  This isn't exactly waiter service.  You walk up to the counter and order the food, and they bring it to you (inside or outside).  I had no trouble with the service at all.    Next time we come here (and there probably will be a next time!) I think we'll try the roti.

This is a review of the giant cookie. I ordered one recently (snickerdoodle), and it wasn't very good. The cookie seemed like it had too much flour in it. Very doughy (not raw-doughy, too much flour doughy). As a result it was also pretty dry.  And they never asked about color for the icing design. I should have thought of it myself, so I have to take some of the blame. They picked a ridiculous color combination (red and zinc chromatic green) for me.  For an order like this they take your phone number, but they never called me to say "hey, you didn't specify a color".  I don't think I'll be ordering one from here again.  I had better luck last time at the Paradise at San Tan Village.

Eh. Better then Taco Bell. That's not saying much, though.  You ask what motivated me to come here?  Apparently they arbitrarily decided that Friday (7/24) was "National Margarita Day".  In actual fact there is a National Margarita Day, and it's Feb 22.  But when they declare an all-day happy hour, fine...it's "National Margarita Day" as far as I'm concerned.  So we get one each of the two types of margarita they sell, plus they had $3 appetizers.  So we ordered the mini chimis, taquitos, and red chile beef cheese crisp.  Plus a side of rice.    I did NOT like the cheese crisp.  Ever smell chili powder?  That's what the red beef tasted like.  Chili powder.  My wife was a bit more forgiving, but I stopped after about 1/2 piece.  The mini chimis were fine.  Nothing special.  In fact, less than nothing special.  "Underwhelming" leaps to mind.  The taquitos tasted like those Delimex ones at Costco...you know, the ones they sample in the store trying to get you to buy the 2000 taquito box in the case behind them?  Yeah, those.  Again, totally underwhelming.  But the rice was flavorful.  I liked that.  The margaritas were sad.  It's a good thing we only paid $1 for them or I'd be upset.  But, after years of seeing this place, I've finally tried it and proven that I was correct not to come here before.  I won't be coming back, either.  Better than Taco Bell, sure.  But why would you want to do either?  Even with "happy hour" pricing it's not worth it.

Other reviewers have really covered this well.  This pass is a great deal, especially on weekdays IF YOU USE IT CORRECTLY.  If you buy the first one around 8pm you will get that dinner, then breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day.  It becomes worth it if you do all that.  If you are in an entrance line when the time expires, you are outta luck, so be sure to be inside your last buffet before the time is up.  We bought ours in line at the Rio (Carnival World).  I'm not sure if you can buy it in the other lines as well, but I would assume you can.  The included buffets are adequate, especially if you include the Carnival World.  We had hoped to do Bacchanal despite the extra cost, but it would have been tight to get to our show (plus we weren't really hungry by the time our last dinner buffet had to be done).  So we didn't.  Next time maybe we'll do it first.  You get a $5 discount if you are a "Total Rewards" member.  It's free to get a card at any Total Rewards desk (I know they have them at Rio, Flamingo, and Harrah's, and probably also at Paris and Planet Hollywood since they're all part of the buffet pass).  But you do have to be over 21 to get a card, so if you're bringing kids they will be full price (because they can't get a card).

We like this place.  The noodles are always fresh (they make them, and you can watch them!), and the food always tasty.  The quality of the service depends on how busy they are and which server you get.  If they're busy the service is spotty even with the better server.  This visit we got the server who doesn't seem to want to be there.  She's mostly indifferent but if you ask for stuff she will bring it.  The food is good.  Some of the best noodles anywhere.  We will keep coming back as long as that is true.

This place was recommended to us by an Indian coworker.  He said the food was very good, and reasonably priced.  So we decided to check it out.  For our first visit we opted for the buffet.  A way to try several dishes at once.  All the food was very good!  My one negative would be that the vindaloo was not spicy.  A good vindaloo is VERY hot.  But on a buffet they have to appeal to everyone, so they can't do that.  Next time I'm ordering from the menu!  Allowing for that, everything was very good.  The buffet  had a selection of chicken and lamb dishes, plus vegetarian, and several desserts.  They also had Indian chai tea, and a mango drink.  The naan bread was very good, too.  My coworker was correct.  Easily the best Indian food we've found in the Phoenix area.  No contest.

We drive by this place all the time, and we see the $3 wash sign.  So, after the mud storm the other day we brought our car here.  They are very fast, not many frills.  You drive up, pay the guy for what you want (they have a full range of wash options), then go through "the tunnel".    It is not a no-touch system.  Beware your antenna.  Once out the other side they have stalls where you can (if you wish) park and vacuum the interior.  They also have compressed air to blow stuff out of crevices.  And it seems you can have as many disposable wet towels as you want.  They are meant mostly for wiping your interior vinyl (they are not 'no streak', so not ideal for glass).  They also sell lots of products from a small cart to aid in cleaning/detailing.  You can do about as much as you want to do, or as little.  We did a first upgrade wash (I forget what it was called).  About $5.  Car looks good.  I think we'll be back.

Well, we have canceled our membership.  Their system was damaging our car.  I'm not entirely sure which step was doing it, but a piece of trim that runs near the edge of the roof was pulled up and bent over after the last time we ran through their wash.  I don't think it was the heavy cloth strips they drag across the car because those would have been more likely to push it back down rather than peel it up.  But, whatever.  Never had this happen before, and not going to chance it again.  Of course they take no responsibility (no car wash does, to be fair).  I think "touchless" is the only way to go.  And this place ain't touchless.

We were here several weeks ago.  The owner is enthusiastic and really cares.  He was eager to help us order, and very interested in our opinions.  But the food we had was just ordinary.  Nothing special.  Some items seemed excessively salty, too.  We did mention the saltiness.  Maybe he'll fix it.  Portion size was OK.  Their menu does feature some interesting sides (sweet potato fries and turnip greens, among others).  There are other places I would go before coming back here.  Maybe if I had a coupon or something.  Otherwise I'm going to Dave's if I'm on this side of town, or Joe's if I'm in Gilbert.

This is a hidden gem.  And I mean hidden.  If you don't know it's there you'll never find it.  If you do know it's there it still may take some looking!  They are part of a church campus.  "The Grove" sign is quite visible from Gilbert Rd, but this coffee shop isn't particularly well-marked.  To help you out, the easiest approach is the turn in by the sign "The Grove" and park in the lot that you just entered.  There is a second entrance just north of the sign that will take you around back.  That can work too, but isn't as obvious.  Once parked you want the small building that you're looking at (glass doors).  They have a very comfy seating area (like a living room), a few tables (inside and outside), and the coffee bar.  Now...on to the coffee...  The coffee is probably some of the best you will ever have.  They get it directly from farmers in Central America as part of their charitable work (they go to villages and help dig wells, build houses, improve farming, etc....any proceeds from this shop goes back to that charitable work).  They actually bring the beans back and roast them here.  So they cut out middlemen both in buying the beans and in processing (roasting them).  The result is gourmet coffee that is less expensive than most outlets.  Here, also, your coffee is prepared custom.  Not much machinery.  The girl hand-tamps the coffee for your espresso, etc.  The result is a really outstanding coffee.  They have several offerings (their "Cuban" is extremely popular and very good).  You can get various additions like almond milk, or cream, or pistachio...etc.  If you are a coffee person, this is the place for you.  The ONLY thing I can ding them on is that their selection of munchies to go with the coffee is extremely limited.  They get a few items from a grocery bakery, but not many.  I would only deduct half a star for that, but YELP doesn't give me that option.  If they ever improve their munchie offerings I will update with that fifth star.

Got a Groupon for this place.  Timing was good because we were going on vacation for a week.  The unique thing about Blue Sky is they have lots of covered parking.  Of course they also are a bit more expensive, but the Groupon really helped with that.  They give you a ticket at the gate, and another slip in the shuttle indicating where you parked.  Don't lose that slip as it has their number to call for a pickup if you get back after hours.  The shuttle showed-up pretty promptly.  For shorter trips this beats using a shuttle service like SuperShuttle.  For longer trips a shuttle service would make more sense since the per-day parking charge will exceed the round-trip cost of the shuttle after more than a week or so (depending on how many people you're traveling with).  Do the math.  If parking makes more sense, this is a good lot.

We came here for dim sum after rave reviews from some trusted friends.  Well....  eh.  First, their "duck tongues".  Supposed to be great.  Frankly, they were like chicken feet.  Nothing to them.  Just bone (yes, there's a bone in the tongue).  Not really the fault of Mekong Palace, of course.  Just the nature of the duck tongue.  But as for the rest, it was very strange.  Pretty much everything we had tasted basically the same.  Shumai, dumplings...everything.  Tasted the same.  Not that it tasted "bad".  It didn't.  But what's the point in a variety of things if they all taste basically the same?  It was boring.  Probably won't be coming back here.

A little tricky to find.  They are behind the Fossil store.  Basically these are standard cupcakes.  They do have some unique ones (such as pumpkin spice for Halloween).  I had a double-chocolate, and it was good.  But it wasn't $3.75 good.  I could do almost as well at home (I'd just need to learn how to do the butter cream frosting).  As I said, the cupcake was good.  But it wasn't GREAT.  And for $3.75 it should be GREAT.  But I suppose if you want something unique (like the pumpkin spice), it might be worth it to come here.

OK, Megan!  Although we've never met I saw your review and took your advice to come here!  We actually showed up late enough to be called "brunch".  I ordered the pulled pork from the lunch menu.  Also ordered by our table was the chorizo burrito (breakfast) and the French toast combo.  I am told the burrito was really good.  The French toast was "good but nothing special", as were the eggs and ham.  My pulled pork and fries also was good.  I like Joe's better for the pulled pork, but this was different.  Sort of sweet and spicy.  I'd give it 3 stars, frankly.  The fries were cooked perfectly.  Crunch on the outside, tender on the inside, but the seasoning was almost non-existent.  Still good, but not great.  I can see trying this place again and ordering something different.  I went with 4 stars mostly because I'm told the burrito was really good.  My pork, and my wife's French toast combo were probably only 3 or 3.5 stars.  So I rounded it.

Sprouts is a great market.  Their produce is generally very good.  They often will let you sample it for quality.  They have a lot of bulk product (grains, peanuts, granola, chocolate morsels, etc).  And they feature a lot of canned/packaged processed organic/natural products like soups and stocks, sauces and salsas, etc.  They also have bulk spice section where they sell by the ounce.  And they feature natural sodas that use real sugar instead of that corn syrup poison.  Not as much variety as a supermarket, but still a good variety of good quality stuff.

Sprouts remains one of our primary markets.  This particular location is conveniently close to our house, so we come here most often.  Good produce, good meats, a lot of organic options for those who want them, many of their processed foods (like frozen dinners) have all-natural ingredients...good stuff.  It is smaller than a supermarket, so there is perhaps a bit less variety.  But still plenty of choices to be had.  And if you want to try something (like an apple) to check the quality, just ask.  They'll happily cut one up for you.

This restaurant hosted the Murder Mystery dinner thing recently.  We bought tickets through Groupon.  There were only three menu choices available, but I won't hold such details against Old Spaghetti Factory.  All I will rate is the food and service.  The Murder Mystery was a different company.  The salad that was presented was sad.  Truly sad.  This pathetic (and SMALL!) thing with a creamy dressing (and we weren't even allowed to choose the dressing!) is what gives salads a bad name.  Even my wife, who loves salads, didn't want it.    There was bread service, and the bread was fine.  A crusty sourdough.  I liked it.  Then the main course.  I got the "spaghetti vesuvius".  Supposed to be a spicy spaghetti with a rose sauce (tomato and cream), chicken and sausage and peppers.  The portion was very small (like a lunch special).  The flavor was fine.  Nothing special but fine.  It looked more appetizing than the salad, but still was sort of sad.  You'd think there was a food shortage or something, and we have this little portion that looks out of place with the size of the plate.  Even some fancy presentation would have helped (like you sometimes see in fancy places where there's not much food on the plate but they do something ornate in hopes you won't notice).  If the pasta hadn't been reasonably good (flavor) I would have to go with one star here.  The salad was pathetic.  The main course looked sad and impoverished.  And the dessert was this tiny scoop of neopolitan ice cream.  Emphasis on "tiny".  Service was reasonable.  Nothing extraordinary, but fine.  That and the taste of the pasta saved them from one star.  Normally I take half a meal home.  This one, which included dessert (which I seldom get) was barely enough to satisfy me.  I had no leftover.  In summary, I'd pass them by.  There are other Italian restaurants that have better food, and more of it.

I used to like Olive Garden, but they've really gone downhill.  Their bread sticks are faint echoes of what they used to be.  And their portion sizes seem to have shrunk.  I had the parmesan crusted steak with ravioli.  Thought I'd go for something different.  The portion was small, the parmesan was very weak, and the steak was stringy.    My wife had stuffed chicken marsala.  The "stuffing" was like the stovetop stuff you buy at Thanksgiving.  Seriously.  Prosciutto?  Couldn't prove it by her serving.  I think they may have held up a photo of prosciutto in front of the dish before bringing it out, but it didn't seem to have any in it.  What it DID have in it was salt.  A LOT of salt.  We actually sent it back, it was that salty.  They replaced it, and it was a bit less salty, but still more than it should have been.  The pasta fagioli soup is the one thing that still seems to be good.  It's the only thing we've really liked there the past two or three times we visited.  That said, I must give them credit for trying to make the salty dish right.  They ended up comping the dish for us, which was nice.  Not that we can really eat it at home either (it's just as salty here!), but my wife is planning to dilute it with something to cut the salt flavor.  I had a coupon, so we ordered a dessert.  The layered chocolate torta thing.  It was good.  Not great, but good.  Oh...and service was attentive.  It wasn't her fault my wife's dish was so salty.  She (Candy) did a good job.  There are a lot better Italian places around.  If you want to do the bottomless soup bowl, that's a pretty good choice.  Everything else is mediocre (or worse).

I've been using Safelite for a while now.  The one near my office closed, so I had to drive to this one.  All I needed was to have the rear view mirror reattached.  The entire assembly came off.  I expected to have to pay, but it's a free service!  They just made sure everything was clean, applied the adhesive, and the mirror is back up!  No charge!  Past services have included chip repair and window replacement, and it's always been zero hassle with insurance.  They handle everything.  (We do have full-glass coverage.)  So I'm going to keep coming back when I have an auto glass problem!

We had a coupon for a free "Guaca-Tony".  And we'd heard some good things, so here we are!  Well, kinda wish we hadn't.  First, let me say the server and manager were very good.  They did their best to take care of us.  That's good...but...  The Guaca-Tony bread was very salty.  No idea why, but it was.  And I LIKE salt.  I'm a potato chip junkie.  But it just didn't work here.  The guacamole was mediocre, too.  Definitely "meh".  If it hadn't been free we might have sent it back.  The calamari was overcooked, too heavily breaded, and salty.  We actually sent that one back.  If you read my reviews you would know I almost never do that.  Maybe once a year.     Lastly we got the rigatoni.  It was spicy and pretty good.  We added meatballs.  They were OK.  Not fabulous, but OK.  Reasonably large, too (though not large like Buca).  The garlic bread that came with it was salty. What's with all the salt? I love salt, but this was too much.  I've never experienced this before.  And it wasn't just me.  My wife had the same reaction.  I'm surprised to see four stars on Oregano's.  Maybe if we had ordered the pizza instead?  But what we ordered was mostly disappointing.  I don't think we'll be back, even though we have another free Guaca-Tony coupon.  I do appreciate the server and the concern of the manager whom the server notified, but that's not enough to make up for mediocre food.

We were just a few miles away from this place, and we were hungry.  Yelp showed good reviews, so we drove over!  First, the parking is tiny.  At least in front.  They say "more parking in back", but it's not immediately obvious how to get to the back.  The building is run down.  Inside, the place is a dive.  Not exactly "dirty", but not what one would call well-maintained.  On the wall is a small menu,  Actually, the sign is large, but there are only a dozen or so items on it.  The primary choices are "tacos" and burritos.  The tacos are soft open tacos, sometimes called "street tacos".  Several meats available.  Asada, pastor, lengua, chicken...  I opted for a combination plate which had some decent refried beans, rice, pastor (pork) and asada (beef).  Normally I give a pass on the beans, but these were tastier than most (I got a sample), so I went with it.  The rice was very good.  The meats were served with warm tortillas.  They were simple, but very good.  From what I know this is really authentic fare.  Not Americanized, just what ordinary Mexicans have in their homes.every day.  It's a bit far from my house in the east valley, but this has made the list of places to go when I find myself in Phoenix.  Be warned, it is cash-only here.

I don't get the big deal.  The ice cream was mediocre. Nothing special at all.  And the "mix-ins", while nice, are again not a big deal.  And this stuff is expensive for being so mediocre.    On the plus side, the staff was very friendly.  If I have a coupon I might return to Cold Stone, but otherwise probably not.  I much prefer Frost gelato.  No contest.

We had high hopes for this place.  Rave reviews (mostly), and personal recommendations.  Heck, if you don't have a reservation you probably aren't getting in!  What a disappointment.  Even with the reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes.  Menu looked appetizing.  Sounded very up-scale!    I had the salmon.  If you can call it that.  The actual salmon was microscopic.  A tiny piece perhaps 2" square by about 1/2" thick.  That's it.  The rest was "greens".  Apparently they expect you to fill up on "greens".  And the flavor of that miniscule bit of salmon was just ordinary.  Nothing special.  One person had a sandwich.  It was small, but bigger than the salmon.  It was reasonably tasty.  At least as good as Quiznos.  But, again, nothing special.  Also, you have to ask for bread service.  It's complimentary, but if you don't ask you don't get.  And the bread wasn't even warm.  The lemonade was really sub-par.  Not good.  The one bright spot was that their apricot tea is really outstanding.  If you like salads and "greens", you might like this place.  The person we went with had been there before, and she loved her strawberry salad.  But even she commented that the portion size had shrunk (she had never finished a whole serving before, but this time she did).  The other two salad-eaters in the group weren't as impressed (they didn't get the strawberry salad, though).  Overall...I'd skip this place.  Drop in and buy the tea (they sell it in leaf form), but skip the food.  Overpriced, undersized, and nothing special on the flavor front.

Chicken was undercooked when we received it, and then came back overcooked when we asked them to touch it up.   The pupusas were claimed to be their specialty, but were mostly cheese.   The black bean rice and bean dip both were really good.  Decor and ambiance are minimal.  Service was slow.  But they did seem to have a steady stream of customers.  Not busy, but not empty either.  I doubt we will return here.

They keep a record of your preferences so they can repeat. They cut your hair quickly and well. A bit pricey, but coupons and rewards card help.  They offer free touch-ups after you've had a cut with them (it's not a full cut, but they'll get the fuzz off your neck and tidy up between cuts).

Well, we've been here twice now.  First time we got pancit.  It was salty.  Not horrible but not great.  Today we mostly bought baked goods.  The pan de sal was mediocre.  The baliwag was mediocre.  The puto bungbong was very disappointing.

We bought a "living social" coupon thing for this place.  We're always up for trying new BBQ!  We got the brisket with the coupon, plus got some sausage links and pulled pork.  Plus the sweet tea.  The tea was very good (though my wife thought it was too sweet...it was just the way I like it).  The brisket, while it had a nice smoke ring, had very little smokey flavor.  And basically no seasoning.  The sausage link was "just a sausage".  No smokiness, nothing special.  The pulled pork was drowned in sauce, so I can't say if it was smokey or not.  The flavor of the pork was OK.  Not great.  Just OK.  Two stars is "I've experienced better".  And I have.  Dave's BBQ is better.  Rudy's is much better.  And Joe's is vastly better.  Texas BBQ House is not bad, but it's not particularly good either.  I've certainly had worse BBQ, but there is much better available.  So why go here (unless it's just that it's convenient to where you are)?

We used a Groupon.  The Groupon is good for standard tint only, and that is explained up-front.  I anticipated having to pay for the first up-grade, and the up-charge was reasonable.  No complaint there.  One small "gotcha" was that removal of the old tint was not included.  The rate wasn't unreasonable, but one should still be aware of this.  I figure the Groupon still saved me $30 or so.  I found the people I dealt with to be courteous, helpful, and professional.  They got the job done, and it appears to be very good.  The true test will be if I still feel this way in 6 months, or if we are having trouble with the tint.  But so far it is excellent.  And it does have a lifetime warranty, so if we do have trouble they said we can just bring it back.  If I have any more tinting that needs doing I will come here and let them do it.  If you don't see an update from me in a few months, that means the tint is holding up well and I'm happy.  :-)

This place appears to be one step above fast-food.  You place your order, then sit down and they bring it to you in about 5-10 minutes.  The food appears to be fresh.  Their menu is interesting because it combines Greek/Mediterranean with "Chicago" foods.  Thus you can order shwarma or a gyro or a big fat burger or an Italian beef sub, etc.  We had their Mediterranean food.  Ordered was a Greek chicken salad, a shwarma plate, and a souvlaki plate.  All were very good.  The portions were good, the flavor was good, and it seemed very fresh.  The prices were reasonable, too.  I might have liked a bit more seasoning, but that's really a minor nit-pick.  I might give only 3.5 stars for that, but since I can't, and since the food was hot and fresh, I'll round this review UP to 4 stars.    For what this place is they are very good.  For a quick meal that is hot, fresh, and not the usual fast food, this is a good choice.

Really good gelato. Our third visit.  We try to come here when we visit San Tan Village.  Numerous flavors, some of which change seasonally (no orange tonight!!).  Others are pretty stable (e.g the dark chocolate and limoncello).  The flavors are strong, but not overpowering, and very nice.  I ended up with limoncello.  Reminds me of Firenze (Italy).  They probably need to me more mindful of how they pack the cups because sometimes there are voids, but if you show them they make it right.  Tonight the void was small, so I ignored it.  Last time is was large, and they gave me a whole new one (that had no voids).  They may also be introducing a frequent visitor or loyalty card of some sort, based on what the owner was saying to me.  I'm sure I'll get to make good use of that!

After more than a year and a half this remains my favorite gelato place, bar none.  Based on the lines I see here most of the time, I'm not alone!  To their credit, they manage to move the line pretty quickly while still giving very good service.  Probably my only complaint is that their orange gelato is "seasonal", and so you can't get it all the time.  Tonight it was gone (though they had "spicy chocolate", which really was spicy...burning the throat several seconds after swallowing).  So tonight I got the limoncello.  Good stuff!  They also have a gelato shake (which my daughter says is great), and a gelato cake (which I plan to try sometime!).  And on your birthday you get a free small (piccolo).  Which is pretty cool.  I just keep coming back for more.

We've been here a few times.  I am not a fan.  But my wife generally likes frozen yogurt, so I'm rating based on her comments.  She's not a fan either.  The selection is pretty limited, it's very pricey (hey, mall space ain't cheap!), and the staff is usually disinterested.  We had one young lady who was enthusiastic, but the others have always been chatting with someone else and very apathetic to our presence.  My wife has tried several flavors, but so far has only liked the pistachio (she says that one is "four star").  All the others she says "meh".  The toppings bar?  Doesn't look nice.  Sorta reminds me of the nut bowl on the bar in a lounge/bar. You just don't even want to touch it.  Alas, we have a pre-paid card to use up, so we'll be back.  Hopefully they'll have more pistachio for her.  Oh...the pre-paid card is, in effect, a "get one free" deal.  You spend $20, but the card is valued at $25.  I believe.  (My wife carries the card.)  We got it on our first visit (when she had the pistachio) because it was a decent deal.  All in all, I much prefer Frost Gelato.

There's a new sheriff in town, and it isn't this place.  First, there was an odd smell when we first walked in.  No idea what it was, but it wasn't a "fresh" smell, shall we say.    The display fruit that was supposed to show the flavors of the various offerings were rotten. Possibly an oversight except when we tried to be helpful and point it out the lady (owner?) seemed annoyed instead of appreciative or even embarrassed.   I mean, seriously...the orange slice was dried-out.  The mango half was nearly black.  Yuck.  And it was resting on top of the mango gelato.  Double-yuck.  On to the gelato. It was ok. The flavors were mild but nice.  My wife did make mention that the pistachio was very good.  My limoncello was very mild.  Not bad, but not bold either.  Usually gelato flavors are bolder.  The portion was much smaller than one normally gets in a gelato shop.  I'd estimate 30% less than typical in most places.   Frankly, there is a much better shop with friendlier employees, tastier gelato, and bigger cups (at almost the same price) less than a mile away. This shop may have been the best in the area before, but they definitely aren't now.  Yes, there's a new sheriff in town, and they're less than a mile up the road from Dolce Vita.  As I said, the gelato was ok. But the bar has been raised, and Dolce Vita just doesn't clear it.  Not impressed.

This place specializes in burgers.  But they aren't ordinary burgers.  They're gourmet burgers prepared in different ways.  They also have some vegetarian fare.  We tried two of their appetizers, and they were really good!  The Children of the Corn fritters were excellent!  I had the Hyde burger which is made from pork, and it was wonderful too!  I believe the chicken sandwich is the Jekyll (though I'm not there now, so I might be wrong!).  Apparently this place was once a haunted house.  They have kept that motif, and their menu items are named after horror movies (e.g. Hyde burger, Children of the Corn fritters, etc).  It's not really very scary, the wait staff isn't dressed up, and they have rock music in the background (it would be nice if they changed it to something a bit more thematic to the motif).  It's just fun.  A tad pricey, but fun.  And very very good food.  Apparently after 9pm they have "scareoke" night...  :-)

I remember this place on Chandler Blvd many years ago.  As I recall it disappeared shortly after the Chandler Mall was built and Dave's BBQ opened.  Dave's isn't the best, but it certainly was better.  Suddenly my wife discovers this location.  Well, we were in the area last night so we stopped in.  Joe's crown is safe (Joe's Real BBQ). Dickey's was totally ordinary. The beans tasted exactly like Bush's beans.  As canned beans go, Bush's are good.  But I expect more in a restaurant than opening a can.  The brisket had no sign of rub or smoke flavor.  It was properly cooked, but tasted like unseasoned beef.  The pork was a bit better, but still bland.  Sauce was mandatory to get any BBQ flavor at all (which good BBQ should NOT require).  I saw a bottle of the sauce and it has HFCS instead of actual brown sugar.   The waffle fries were very good.  They do have free soft serve ice cream, which is a nice touch.  But overall "I've experienced better".  I might go 2.5 stars, maybe.  And if I have to round my rating I absolutely cannot go to three stars.

This location is a "corporate" store.  As such they accept all coupons and groupons.  We had a groupon, and the location at Tempe Marketplace wouldn't accept it.  The format is the same, however.  Mongolian BBQ.  A 'bar' where you select what you want in your bowl (meats, veggies, spices and sauces), take it to the cook, and he cooks it up for you.  There are several places that do this (such as YC's).   We found the ingredients here to be good, a nice variety, and the staff was very friendly.  The finished bowls were delivered to our tables cooked and piping hot.  Probably the one thing I have to ding them for is not providing enough starch (in my case, noodles).  Of course I do pack a lot into my bowl (see below for my tip), but still...they should add 50% more noodles than what they do.  Also, YC's usually has a person who will suggest combinations (if you don't already know what you want).  GG doesn't seem to do that.  Tip:  bring a sheet of wax paper with you so you can pack down your bowl.  You'll get more that way.  Also, the veggies should go in first because they will tend to want to fall off the top if you put them in last.  Mushrooms at the bottom (they don't grip on anything).  Meats on top.  Mound the bowl high, you get as much as you can fit onto the bowl for the one price.  So don't be timid.  And, yes, you can take home the leftovers.

OMG, this is what eating out should be!!  Seriously.    Why go out to get a burger you could do just as well at home?  Uncomfortable hard benches and tables so you can't move your seat relative to the table, ordinary food, the usual fountain drinks, servers in uniforms with plastic name tags, etc.  Well...not here.  The decor is very cozy and homey.  You could almost be in someone's house.  Wood tables, chairs that move and are comfortable, and simple yet elegant and exciting food!  As I said, this is what eating out should be.  We didn't do anything from the "starter" section.  Our starter was a bruschetta order.  Theirs is not those little 2" bread circles.  They appear to have taken a full Italian loaf and sliced it thick (about an inch).  Four pieces (there are six to choose from), all very unusual and unique.  This really is a meal all by itself.  Now I'm not really a cheese guy.  I like mozzarella, ricotta, paremsan, and such (i.e. Italian cheeses usually on Italian food).  These things have goat cheese, feta, cream cheese, etc.  I didn't really expect to like these, but this was a treat for my lady and she LOVES different cheeses.  Well, I tried them...and they were good!  I think I liked the salmon and pesto one best (I forget which cheese was on it).  If you're a Spaniard you'll think of these as tapas.  And they are very much like that.  As I had planned to leave most of the bruschetta to my wife (which I did) I had ordered the tomato bisque soup.  It was very good.  Very thick, which I liked.  Finally, my wife had the BLT salad and I had the pulled pork.  I almost went with the grinder, but wanted a hot sandwich (and the grinder is cold).  Both were excellent.  I was a bit hesitant because my pulled pork standard is Joe's Real BBQ, and that's simply one of the best ever.  But this was a very respectable (and delicious) sandwich.  Most places I would not order the pulled pork because it is such a disappointment compared to Joe's, but this one I would order again.  It holds up well against Joe's.  (Joe's is a bit better but it's not a rout.)  My wife really (really!) liked her BLT salad.  We were so enjoying everything that, despite being quite full, we ordered one of their desserts.  The lady chose the coconut tres leches.  I'm not a fan of coconut, so you can't really go by me.  But she loved it.  It was a large piece, and she really enjoyed the flavor.  We really enjoyed the entire dining experience.  The seating, the ambiance, the attentive servers, and of course the food.  My wife was saying "best lunch ever!", and even posted such commentary on Facebook.  She was actually excited by the meal.  When was the last time that happened to you?  I'm pretty sure if you're reading this that it didn't happen at the Olive Garden or Chili's!  But I'll bet it will happen here.  Sorry for the novel, but this place deserves it.  It's a tad pricey, but you easily could go to a chain and pay comparable prices for a meal for two that wouldn't be as good.  We will be coming back.  The menu isn't huge, so I wouldn't want to come so often that I get tired of it.  But I do want to come back and have another dining experience like we had today.

I should really come here more often.  Hard to beat.  As I said a year and a half ago, "OMG this is what eating out should be".  And it is.  Some unique and tasty items on the menu combining wonderful flavors, good service...truly hard to beat.  I can't pretend to have been everywhere in Phoenix, but this is certainly the best restaurant I know about in Phoenix.  I do prefer their dinner menu to their lunch menu, but both are excellent.  The rest of my previous review still applies.  My one criticism is that they don't have a death-by-chocolate dessert.  But the desserts they do have are very good, and not the typical fare you find in most places.

First time we went to Rudy's we spotted this place under construction.  Well, now they're open.  We decided to give it a try.  Tried their pulled pork, their shredded beef, and their sliced brisket.  The service was very enthusiastic.  Employees were eager to help and explain stuff.  Also, the ambiance of the place is very nice.  Much better than Rudy's (or Joe's).  it's a much more relaxing environment to eat.  I really liked it.  They use a cafeteria/deli approach.  You get in line, walking past the case and pointing at what you want.  Sorta like Joe's, actually.  But they pack it up and label it like the grocery store deli.  Not saying this is a problem.  It's just how they do it.  The pulled pork was fine.  Nothing special.  Just OK.  The shredded beef was not as good.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't taste like barbecue to me.  It tasted like shredded beef.  Which is fine, but where's the BBQ?  Where's the smoke?  Their sliced brisket was moist and tender, and tasted like an oven-roasted brisket.  Basically no smoke flavor at all, and if there was a rub (they said there was), it was very (VERY!!) mild.  All in all, disappointing.  It might be fine for people that like bland food (hey, there's nothing wrong with that!), but it wasn't really barbecue, in my opinion.  If their food was like Rudy's or Joe's, combined with their dining room ambiance, we'd have a new barbecue place.  But it wasn't even close.  Again, I'm not saying it was bad.  But it definitely wasn't as bold and flavorful as barbecue is supposed to be.  My wife did like their fresh jerky.  So there is that.  But I doubt they will survive long when they are literally across the street from the bold flavors of Rudy's.  Not unless they change their recipes.  Prices are comparable to Rudy's, but not the flavors.  (Sorry for mentioning Rudy's so much, but as they are less than 100' apart they are inviting comparisons.)

This is one of two locations for this practice.  They have on staff here several specialists, and so can address all aspects of your eye health.  They may cost a tad more than a simple optometrist, but they can deal with anything you have.  Our daughter had a sty removed several years ago (by Dr Mansueto), and my wife and I have been coming here for full check-ups for even longer, starting with Dr Lewis (who has since retired).  This last visit I was informed that I will probably need cataract surgery in about 10 years.  Unless things change with this practice I will come here for that procedure.  I've seen both Dr Matsumoto and Dr Konti, and both seem very competent.

My wife has had foot problems for a few years now.  Initially it was a neuroma which was diagnosed by Dr Discont.  The orthotics he had made fixed her problem.  However, recently, she began having severe pain.  X-rays revealed she had bone spurs which led to plantar's fasciitis.  For this she saw Dr Krahn.  Initially I was concerned that Dr Discont was not available (he was booked out several weeks).  But Dr Krahn has proven to be a knowledgeable, patient, and thorough physician.  He methodically applies treatments, and if results are not satisfactory, he moves to an elevated treatment.  Surgery is his last resort, and so far my wife has managed to avoid it.  She is still battling her problem, but progress is being made.  Dr Krahn is pleased with it, and thinks we will be able to avoid surgery.  And now our daughter, the soccer player, is seeing Dr Krahn for foot pain and ankle spraining.  It's too early to tell, but the x-rays showed her feet were fine.  She is getting therapy to strengthen her ankles, and we are hopeful that the foot pain was just because her cleats were a bit too small (even though she thought they fit fine).  I definitely can recommend this office.  And while both doctors are good, I'm really liking Dr Krahn.

I really wanted to like this place.  It's much closer than the chiropractor I've been using.  I liked my chiropractor, but it's just incredibly hard to get to the office after work fighting traffic on the US 60.  The Joint is so much more convenient.  I've been in chiropractic care for the better part of 30 years now.  I've been to numerous practitioners over that time.  Some were absolutely dreadful, some were neutral, and one or two were really good.  So I gave The Joint a chance, having done four visits before writing this review.  First, the staff is very nice.  I don't doubt for a moment that they actually did care and wanted to alleviate my issues.  But they were unable to do so.  At most I would get a few hours of relief and then the pain would creep in.  My last visit I can't even say that.  I experienced little relief, and then a NEW pain appeared.  A very severe pain, far worse than what I had before.  I relented and went back to my previous chiropractor, dealing with the traffic and long drive.  She said my "L4" was out, adjusted me, and relief began almost immediately.  It's been a full day now, and it's not perfect, but it's a lot better.  I will need another visit to finish this off, but I think it is an illustration of the difference.  So I cannot recommend The Joint.  While they exhibited concern and empathy, they didn't really exhibit competence at producing positive results.  And that ultimately is the whole point of chiropractic care.  I can recommend my other chiropractor if you live near her office, or are willing to fight the US 60 to get there.

What can I say, it's Chipotle.  Fast food, but done really well.  Their burritos are large, and their prices reasonable.  You tell them what you want in it, and they make it right in front of you.  I'm not normally a fast-food fan (in fact, I hate it).  But this is the exception to the rule.  Don't expect authentic Mexican food here.  It's not.  It's Mex-American burritos.  But if you're hungry, want something fast and inexpensive, and can't stand the usual greasy fast-food crap, Chipotle is a good alternative.  For what they are, they are very good.  If you're wondering how they compare to Qdoba, frankly I find them interchangeable.  They both do the same thing, and they both do it well.

Rudy's is based out of Texas.  Today is their grand opening in Arizona, and Chandler is lucky enough to get them.    Today I had pulled pork and "Rudy's Beans".  I always get the pulled pork on a first visit to any BBQ place.  It's how I measure the place.  The beans are really mediocre.  Very soupy, a lot of pepper, and really nothing special.  Not bad, but not great.  The pork has a very mustard-y flavor.  Caught me by surprise.  I had thought mustard-y BBQ was typical of Tennessee and the Appalachian region.  But it was good.  And it was BIG.  They put a lot of meat on that sandwich!  There was also some chopped-up vegetables in it (onion and celery, I think).  I tried my wife's brisket and creamed corn.  The brisket was very smoky, and very nice.  I hate creamed corn, but this one was actually pretty good.  I was surprised.  They were also giving out samples of their sausage.  That was really really good!!  I ordered some for take-out.  Not as good as Joe's Real BBQ, but better than Dave's!  Also, I noticed that their sauce is labeled with "contains no HFCS".  Which is great!!  You can buy their sauce and rub in their store.  The place is loud.  You go up to the counter, tell them what you want, and they shout to the cooking folks in the back.  They also shout "next in line" a lot.  The meats are sold in 1/2 lb increments.  I'm sure we'll be back.

Just a quick update.  Covered most things in my first review, and nothing there has changed.  I do want to add the comment that their green chili stew is really good!  We went today for lunch.  I ordered brisket and sausage, both of which were very good.  But we had a chance to have the stew (someone catered a lunch at my company using Rudy's, so I had tried it there).  Today we made a point of ordering a quart of it!  Really good stuff.

Sorry, I just can't recommend Rudy's anymore. They are just ordinary now. When they opened they were really good.  I was there on opening day.  I'm the one who entered Rudy's into Yelp and uploaded the first photo.  They were four stars when they opened three years ago.  Theirs was the best brisket around here. Now, despite the smoke ring there is almost no smoke flavor. Couldn't taste any rub either.  You have to drown it in sauce to get any flavor (and good BBQ does NOT need sauce!).  The only worthwhile things now are the sausage and green chili stew. Not enough to recommend them.  I have no plan to return.  It's only slightly closer than Joe's, and Joe's is so much better.

This is a teppanyaki joint.  I think there's some ordinary seating in the bar area, but otherwise it's a teppanyaki joint.  The first thing you have to understand is that you are paying for the show.  There are 8 people to a griddle/chef.  You get the chef all to yourselves for a couple of hours.  Our reservations were for 7pm.  They didn't really get started until 7:30, and we didn't leave until after 9pm.  I'm pretty sure they didn't have another seating after us, so that was it for the chef.  He prepared 8 meals.  So, of course, it's going to be expensive!  The other thing about teppanyaki, a lot of the enjoyment is heavily dependent on the personality of the chef.  They all are skilled with their knives and utensils.  But some are more "fun" than others.  Ours this evening was OK.  I'm not a frequent teppanyaki goer, but I have had chefs that were more fun.  But this guy wasn't bad.  The food itself was prepared well.  Teppanyaki is not fancy.  Simple fried rice with soy (or maybe oyster) sauce, simple fried meats (including beef, chicken, salmon, scallops, and shrimp), and simple fried veggies.  Seasoning is minimal (mostly just salt and pepper), and sauces are probably just soy, hoisin and oyster..  I'm honestly not sure which he used.  That's all there is to it.  As I said, it was prepared well and was very good.  Simple, but good.  One criticism, he did the mixed vegetables last.  I would have preferred them right after the rice (which he did first).  By the time the vegetables were put on our plates I was almost done.  I would rather they have come right before the meat.  One tip:  get the filet mignon instead of the steak.  It's only slightly more expensive, and is MUCH better (more tender, etc).  I had the filet and the salmon.  Both were good.  If the show had been a bit better I likely would have gone with 5 stars.  I'm paying for the show, so that has to factor into the rating.  And I have seen better shows.  It's not steak au poivre, but for what it is it was very good.  Oh...and if you like sake...bring a designated driver.  He has a squirt bottle full of it and likes to squirt it in people's mouths.  Apparently the "record" is a count of 137 (they count while they're squirting).  I think they relied on that a little too much for the "entertainment", but folks seemed to like it.

We spotted "free coffee" and thought we'd try it.  While there I got a donut.  Pricing about same as bosa, but not as good. The "old fashioned" was a mouthful of sugar. Couldn't really taste the cake part of the donut.  I like sugar, but I wanted a donut.  I really can't recommend this place.  It wasn't awful, but Bosa (and another shop I need to review soon) are much better.  Heck, Fry's is right next door and their bakery makes better donuts.  Not much more to say.  Try someplace else.

Well, it's been a year.  Figured I should update.  First, I still don't like the prepaid plan thing.  Too much like a contract.  This is supposed to be quasi-medical, not a gym membership.  However, after the first year was over the x-rays showed clear changes in all three of us.  Further, my headaches (that radiate from my neck) are much less frequent.  In fact, it's now an unusual event when i get one.  So that's good!    I did end up with some back pain that the standard treatment didn't fix (in fact, it occurred after I started with them!).  After several weeks complaining about it the adjustment routine was altered and now it does seem to be fading away.  Where I was aware of it constantly before, now I seldom notice it.  If it wasn't for the slow response to my complaints I'd probably go 5 stars, but I think it took too long before it was decided we needed to try something different.  Gotta give a deduction for that.  We are continuing with this office for the time being.  There has been definite improvement.

As the name says, they make the pizza then you take it home and bake it.  Interesting concept.  I think it's a little pricey, but they put on a LOT of toppings.  Their largest size barely fits in our oven (which is a standard wall oven).  But it fits.  They put it on a baking tray for you, but after about 8-10 minutes you want to take it off the tray so the bottom of the crust will firm-up a bit.  You can leave it on the tray, but it will come out limp.  Cooked, but limp.  Transferring to the oven rack resolves that problem.  It is easy to tear the crust doing this, so be careful (or put the tray on a rack below the pizza to catch anything that may drip).  We ripped one because we tried to move it too soon.  The pizza itself is very tasty.  Toppings seem fresh, and the sauce is good.  And I prefer eating at home anyway!  There are coupons available pretty regularly (mail flyers and such), which make it a bit less pricey.

My wife has foot problems.  I have knee problems.  These things have made us aware of the importance of good footwear.  But good footwear is very difficult to find.  Most shoes are pieces of crap, frankly.  No stability, no support, no shock absorption.  This store specializes in shoes and sandals that do offer such support and quality.  You pay for it, but it's cheaper than suffering foot problems.  And their staff seems to knows their stuff.  If you want to have healthy (pain-free) feet, you need good shoes.  And this is one of the few places you can find them.

Been a long time since I reviewed.  But I don't go shoe shopping much either.  When I do this is my first choice.  Most of their shoes are good for your feet.  Crappy shoes lead to foot problems and lots of pain.  They're pricing is a bit high, and their sales are often mediocre.  But if you want good footwear that helps with your foot problems (or prevents you from getting foot problems) this is the place.  Most of their sales people are knowledgeable, but I do prefer Aaron.  He's one of their trainers.  If he's not available you can usually rely on the other staff.  Before you say "but it's so expensive", how much is living without foot pain worth?  Both my wife and I have problems, so in hindsight I can say the "cheap shoes" we used to get weren't so cheap.

As the name implies, they sell batteries.  All kinds of batteries.  This is the closest battery shop to my house.  The staff seems to know their products, and the prices are comparable to other battery shops.  Usually I come here for the large lead-acid battery for my UPS.  Today we actually came for a tiny watch battery.  They had it, and the price was reasonable.  You can probably beat the prices online, but there is value to having someone who can answer your questions and give advice.  Plus it is easier to return something here.  And shipping some of those heavy batteries would not be cheap.  For ordinary alkaline batteries I go to Costco.  For just about anything else I come here.

Generally when I need a battery, this is where I come now.  It's a small store, so they don't have everything on-hand.  But odds are they can order it for you.  On this occasion I needed to replace an old Macbook battery.  No, they didn't have it, but 'yes' they could order it.  And, believe it or not, they were cheaper than the prices I found online!  Took a week to get it, but I have it installed and it's charging now (I'm on a different computer...I'm going to go to full charge and then full discharge once).  I routinely get my gate opener batteries here too (lead-acid).  I'm happy with them thus far.

What can I say?  It's Chipotle.  There is nothing really special about this location over any other.  So if you like Chipotle then you know what to expect!  They do burritos and "bowls" (which are basically burritos without the tortilla for those worried about carbs).  The burrito is generously large, and the ingredients are flavorful.  They make it in front of you very quickly.  There are several options including chicken, steak, carnitas (pork) and barbacoa.  Several salsas to choose from (or you can mix...I usually do).  For fast-food this is top-notch.  Much better than McD's or KFC or something like that, about the same price range for a meal (maybe a little more), and very tasty.

We happened to be going by here and on an impulse decided to stop.  It's a tiny place right on the road.  They have a drive through and a walk-up window.  When we visited there were two young, very enthusiastic people inside.  They had several coffees available, as well as some Italian soda.  My wife had the coffee, I tried the soda.  We were both very happy with our choices.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't.  And the enthusiastic service has to count for something, so we'll go with four stars.  They also have a stamp card so you can get a free beverage when you fill it.

This is a nice mall.  It's a bit far, but they have a good variety of stores.  The food court is OK (could be better).  This trip we were looking for shoes carried ONLY by the Dillard's in this mall.  It was a successful mission.

Very small affair. Food overpriced, as expected, but not any better than restaurants where you'll get more for less. Mostly booths selling stuff, including timeshare!!  Yes, timeshare!  I thought that was kinda tacky.    There are some dance exhibitions, but not continuous. About every 90 minutes.  They have 5-yr old kids who can't really dance (they're only 5!!).  They're relying on the cute factor, but I'd rather have seen some real dancers.    Greek coffee is interesting.  Fortunately I had a coupon so didn't have to pay the admission.  They've been doing this a long time, and it seems everybody has heard of it.  But I was mostly underwhelmed.

There are two listings here on Yelp.  However, if you check Winco's website the address they show is THIS one (Power Rd), not the Hampton address.  So I'm putting my review here.  This building used to be Costco.  Costco moved about a mile down the road, and Winco moved in.  Winco reminds me of Food4Less.  Same basic layout, and I don't think Food4Less took credit cards either.  Plus you bagged yourself, just like Winco.  The prices here are mostly reasonable.  You can do better in a regular grocery if you shop the sales, however.  For everyday prices these guys are a little lower, and I think at least some of that is the 5% (approximately) that they save by not accepting credit cards (VISA and those all charge a percentage of every transaction, which stores pass on to us).  Factor that in and this place probably isn't any better than Basha's or Fry's, and not as good as Costco.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad store.  But I wouldn't make a special trip here unless they had some great sale or coupon (which they did for their grand opening).  They are more hype than anything really special.  And, just to emphasize, they DON'T take credit cards.  Be aware of this, because they don't have it posted anywhere except at the registers.  By then you've already finished your shopping.  If it weren't for this I'd probably have granted three stars.

I've driven by many times, but never stopped.  With a restaurant.com certificate in-hand we stopped this time.  It's a very small place.  I would estimate 10 tables/booths.  You order at a counter and they bring it to you when it's done.  The menu is a sign above the counter.  Very "divey".  Our group ordered a variety of things.  As always, at  a "new" place I order a chimi (or, in this case, burro because they didn't have a chimi).  It was very good.  Everyone seemed to like their food.  For the price this is pretty good.  The ambiance sucks, but the food is what you come for.  Not the best Mexican I've had, but definitely the best within about 10 miles of my house.

First off...it's a burrito place.  Sorta like Chipotle.  One big difference is that they start with a ball of dough.  They pop it into a press and out comes a tortilla.  Very fresh.  Then the usual rice and beans and filling.  Etc.  I give it four stars as a burrito place.  I'm not comparing it to a steak house or a full Mexican place.  For what it is it's very good.  Very tasty, very fresh.  They even have a stamp card for frequent diners.

This is a "brunch" place.  They close at 2pm.  We came here around noon.  It's in the Sam's parking lot.  The decor is sort of confused.  Part of it seems like a road-side country stand with corrugated iron walls, but then it has those translucent curtains on the windows one might see in one's grandma's kitchen.  This isn't a problem, but I did notice it.  The music was nice...instead of top 40 they were playing older rock and easy listening.  That seemed to fit the ambiance.  The menu is American country cuisine.  Comfort food.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  I had the meatloaf with red wine gravy, my wife had the chicken-fried chicken.  Both entrees were really good.  Both were accompanied by mashed potatoes (whose primary seasoning appeared to be pepper).  The chicken also came with corn, the meatloaf came with sauteed zucchini and asparagus.  They were nothing special (the corn was buttery, the other vegetables were...well...vegetables).  The white gravy on the potatoes (and chicken) was surprisingly nice (I've never been a fan of that when I get chicken-fried steak or chicken).  The sauce on the meatloaf was a brown sauce, apparently made with wine.  Plus the meat was seasoned nicely.  No ketchup glaze here!!  All in all, it was a nice and satisfying meal.  Not gourmet by any means, but American comfort food done very well.  And the pricing and portions were reasonable.

They feature live music.  I don't know when, but a coworker's band was here this night.  So we showed up.  Several 1-star reviews made me nervous.  First impression:  pricey. $9 sliders is too much.  Three typical-sized sliders. Happy hour cuts that in half, which is OK, but at full-price I don't think so!!  Flavor was pretty good if you use the sauce they provide. Otherwise they were just ordinary pork.  No evidence of smoking or seasoning.  Wings were better because they were cooked with a sauce.  Again, very pricey unless you get 1/2-off for happy hour.  Service was not very attentive.  We were in the bar, but not sitting at the bar.  Maybe they were short-staffed?  Don't know.  But we only saw her occasionally.  When we did manage to get her she was friendly and would get whatever we wanted.  I just can't go to three stars.  The food was overpriced for the quantity given, and while the food was "OK" it wasn't really anything special.  Perhaps their entrees are bigger/better?  Well, I can only rate based on what I had.  Yes, I did get happy hour pricing.  Which I had to remind them when the bill came.  They fixed it, but it was still annoying.  I think 1-star is too harsh, though.  They were better than that.  But I've definitely "experienced better".  Local beers available.

This location is actually a call center for them.  However, they have one guy on site who does windshield repairs.  I made an appointment and brought our vehicle in for a simple rock-hit repair.  The guy finished it relatively quickly (less than 20 minutes).    The impact site is still visible, but its appearance is much reduced.  Which is what I expected.  If you didn't know it was there you might not notice it.  And the resin they use insures the windshield won't crack further from that site as often happens with damaged glass.  Yes, I would come here again.

Dr Greg has been doing this a long time. I first needed a chiropractor about 20 years ago. I found one that seemed OK at the time.  He was slow, but I'd feel better after a while.  When I moved away from there I had trouble finding a new guy. After several different guys (and ladies) I found Dr Greg. Been with him for about 10 years now.  All I can say is that when he's done I nearly always feel better.  If not immediately, then within a few hours.  His methods seem to work quickly, and he's pretty good at finding little trouble-spots that are causing all the problems.  My only complaint would be that he's not open Tuesdays and Thursdays (but he will often come in anyway if you are having problems).

First, understand that I hate massages.  I get them because they are helpful not because I actually enjoy them.  We've tried several places in the past year or so.  Most have been OK, I suppose.  But I'm not convinced they really made progress fixing anything.  So I get a groupon for Structura and tried it out.  The first massage they seemed to be really focused on addressing knots and tightness.  Well, after three visits now I am ready to review them.  It hurts like hell.  But each subsequent visit there seems to be progress.  Things they worked last time don't hurt as much this time.  They really seem to know what they are doing.  For now this is our massage place.  Between my wife and me we have used Dustin, Tate, and Christina.  All three seem to be really good.  I still hate massages, but if they are fixing problems then I'm good with it.

My fellow yelpers let me down!!  :-(  There is no way this is a 4.5-5 star place.  No way.  Not even close.  Go to La Tolteca and then try to tell me this is a 4-star joint.  Seriously.  I learned of this place because of restaurant.com.  I saw an offer there, so I came here to check them out.  I see 4.5 stars.  I'm thinking "great!".  So I snag the certificate.  We show up, and it's a hole in the wall.  Which is fine.  Some great food sometimes can be found in such places.  Inside was sort of divey.  Again, that's fine.  We both ordered combos.  I got the chimi (because I almost always do when checking out a new place), and my wife got the asada.  They apparently have only one chimi (beef).  I usually get chicken or machaca, but oh well.  Staff was friendly enough, so far so good.  The chimi was well-cooked.  The tortilla was light and crispy.  The one in the asada burro was fresh.  Again, so far so good.  But that's really where the goodness ended.  The chimi had basically no flavor.  And they did not provide any pico to put on it (they actually CHARGE for a tiny cup of pico).  The guacamole appeared to be fresh, but tasted like nothing more than mashed avocado.  It should have some zip to it.  It's more than just mashed avocado, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The asada burro was a bit better in flavor, but the meat was grisly.  Excessively so.  And the flavor was only marginally better than my chimi.  I would take this place over one of the national chains like Taco Bell, but there are so many better places than this that I can't see coming back here.  They weren't horrible, but "meh, I've experienced better".  For sure.

As the name states this is an oil and vinegar shop.  Different olive oils from all over the world, plus some other varieties (walnut oil, anyone?).  Plus lots of vinegars from all over too.  They also have some seasonings, some containers for the oils and vinegars, some imported serving plates, and such as that.  The sales guy seemed very knowledgeable, and was very helpful.  Samples are encouraged.  It's a tad pricey, but what do you expect?  This isn't really the place to come for generic olive oil.  You can get a gallon of that at Costco (and it's fine oil).  But if you want a specialty oil for that killer salad you plan to make, or perhaps to use on a bruschetta, this is the place to get it.  You really wouldn't cook with these oils.  The flavors are too subtle and would lost in a sauce.  These are finishing oils.  I'm sure we'll be coming back.

As the star rating says, "meh, I've experienced better".  And I'm not talking about in Thailand (where, yes, it is MUCH better).  We were recommended here, and had the opportunity, so we stopped-in.  Hostess was very pleasant   There was only one other occupied table at the time (though a few people popped in for take-out while we were there).  We eventually selected a few dishes and were told it would be about 15 minutes.  Which was pretty close to accurate.  The food itself was fine.  Nothing special at all.  Just fine.  It had ZERO heat, which for Thai food just doesn't work.  I understand not everyone likes a lot of heat.  Heck, even I can't eat Thai-hot.  But there should be some!  They do provide chili flakes and chili oil, which I used.  It helped a bit.  Don't get me wrong.  The food wasn't bad.  It just wasn't great either.  I think they Americanized too much.  The cook (and owner?) did come out and visit the table, which was nice.  One big complaint is portion size.  Much smaller than most Thai places I've visited.  The rice portion was absurd.  I think they tried to distract you from the small quantity by doing a nice presentation (cone-of-rice, anyone?).  But it really doesn't make up for there not being enough rice for the dish.  Even though the dish (curry) wasn't that much.  We had to order more rice, which also came out in a small cone.  For a buck.  Usually a dollar buys a decent-sized bowl of rice, probably 2x the amount in their fancy cone.  Face it, rice is cheap.  There's really no excuse to skimp like that.  Overall, disappointing.  Nice staff, but a bit skimpy on the quantity and the flavor was just-OK.  There are too many other Thai places out there that have better food (and more of it) to come here again.

This is a franchise out of California.  They are relatively new to Phoenix.  This store just opened this week.  I don't really like yogurt.  But this doesn't taste like yogurt, it tastes like ice cream. I like it. Plus they have some sorbets. It is self serve, priced by weight (including toppings), and you can opt to have a waffle or not (no charge...they subtract the weight of the waffle when they ring you up). Reasonable price per ounce, but if you fill the cup you're looking at about $5 (it's a decent-sized cup).  Lots of toppings to choose from, including M&Ms, nuts, animal crackers, boba, fruit, and a lot more.  Plus a few syrups if you want them (the hot fudge is good, but not so hot it melts the yogurt/sorbet instantly...which is nice).  Overall I like it.  Staff seems to be friendly and helpful.

We spotted this on Yelp, and the ratings looked good!  So we stopped for lunch.  They offered us samples, which was cool.  The chicken was fine.  The beef was good.  And the pork was really good!  So my wife got the Monday special (taquitos) and I got hard-shell tacos.  I was immediately concerned when I saw how little meat goes into the tacos.  They literally put in one little scoop.  It should have been two.  It really should have been two.  Then maybe I would have tasted the meat.  As it was, I couldn't taste it at all.  It may as well have not been there.  Very surprising given how flavorful the sample was.  The taquitos were OK.  Nothing special.  Just OK.  I wanted to like this place, but this was just sad.  Note to self:  don't order tacos or taquitos here ever again.    Staff was friendly and solicitous.  I'll give them that.  We may try them one more time, and if we do we'll order the burritos.  If they just put one tiny scoop of meat into those, it will be the last.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  Given all the positive reviews I could be convinced to try once more.  But to say "I've experienced better" is an understatement, I'm sorry to say.

When KKD first came to Phoenix I liked it.  It was different.  I could see the donuts being made, and get some still-warm from the oil.  As I tried other donuts of theirs I found they were really mediocre.  Pretty much just the glazed ones still warm were any good.  Today we had a coupon for a free donut and coffee.  My wife opted for a sour cream donut.  I will be fair and say the sour cream donut was not bad.  But overall I can't really recommend KKD as a donut shop.  There are other shops that seem to do better donuts overall.

Motivated by a coupon we came here.  They have a limited menu. As their name implies, they do noodle "boxes".  Four noodle choices, plus rice if you prefer. We ordered a variety.  We had Dan Dan, Mongolian, a Pho soup, and Indian Butter Chicken.  It is very Americanized.  Not even remotely authentic flavors. Their kung pao isn't spicy (says right on their menu board).  Dan Dan is apparently the kung pao with extra spice, but still not like real kung pao.  Mongolian was tasty. Indian butter chicken sorta tasted Indian, but not really like butter chicken should.  I never thought I would utter this statement, but you'd do better going to Panda Express.  More choices, marginally better food, and a bit less expensive.  I won't be back.  (And, no, I won't go to Panda either.)

We saw the place being built and were hoping it would be a good bakery close to our home.  Well...meh....  It wasn't really bad, but it was nothing special (and over-priced).  We got two loaves of bread, and even though they were supposed to be very different they were pretty ordinary.  We didn't try their sandwiches, so can't comment on that part of their offerings.  But we like the bread at Great Harvest, and Whole Grain bakeries better.  And they're less expensive.  Disappointing because both those places are a lot further from our house.

There really isn't much to say here.  This is a budget SuperShuttle.  Their vans aren't as new and shiny, but the A/C works and the drivers are friendly.  And you save 10% compared to SuperShuttle.  What more could you want?  I paid for a round-trip, so when we returned all I had to do was call the dispatch number and let them know we were at baggage claim.  They directed us outside, and a few minutes later a van showed up.  Easy peasy.

First you should know what this place is.  It's basically like Chipotle or Qdoba or maybe Cafe Rio.  Burritos and tacos (I only saw soft tacos, but maybe they do hard also?).  You go in, tell them what you want, pick your meat and fillings, and you're done.  What makes this place better, I think, is that they have more than three meats.  It's not "carnitas, chicken, or beef".  Well, it is...but they have several variations of each.  This is what sets Most Wanted apart from Chipotle.  Different flavors and different heat levels.  They will give you samples to try also.  They also don't skimp on the ingredients.  The burrito was so full they could barely wrap the tortilla all the way around.  The disadvantage to that is that it comes open easily and is difficult to hold.  Keep it in the foil or it will fall apart on you, peeling the foil down as you go.  It was big enough I took half of it home.  Another thing I like is that it isn't a mega-chain like Chipotle.  All in all, a nice experience.  Good flavors, generous portions.  I don't live near here, but when in the area this place will be on my radar.

This is a unique place!  I was pleasantly surprised.  They have a few different sorts of tea (green, black, red), and then they can add fruit flavors and "stuff" (like boba).  I saw one that looked good, but I didn't want strawberry.  No problem!  They substituted mango so I had orange, lemon, mango.  With a slight carbonation.  I really liked it!  Perhaps a tad pricey, but very refreshing.  The others in my party were also happy with their choices.

New patient visit for our daughter, plus I'm including the follow-up visit (bloodwork results).. Dr Deroock was very nice, knew her history (obviously read the paperwork), seemed to know what he's doing. Billing was no more obnoxious than any other clinic.  That is, it was obnoxious but many specialists' offices are regarding billing.  This was no worse.  Of course, I haven't seen the explanation of benefits from insurance yet.  I reserve the right to amend this if it is messed up.  The important bit was that Dr Deroock was patient and thorough, did not seem to be in a hurry to leave, and answered questions.  He tested for numerous possibilities, and even ordered an additional test after seeing the first test results.  He left me with confidence that all bases had been covered and we had as much information as there was to get.  That's sort of the whole point, isn't it?

It's a donut shop.  They have other stuff, too.  But basically it's a donut shop.  Brand new location.  I do my best not to eat donuts because they are soooo not good for me.  But if I'm going to have a donut, Bosa is the one.  I've not tried the boba drinks nor their "sandwiches".  My wife likes them.  I can't help but think of the scene from "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" where they have a burger with a donut bun.  :-)  But, no, they don't use donuts as buns here, so fret not!  All I can say is they do have my wife's seal of approval.  Anyway...donuts, coffee and tea, boba drinks, and breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  This is what they do.  Their donuts are probably the best in town, or at least the best I've found so far.  You pay a bit more than grocery store donuts, but it's not that much more and these are MUCH better.

This is really far from home.  But it's next door to the Costco Business Center.  We visit the Costco a few times a year, and nearly always stop here too.  This market is geared towards Latin American people.  Produce, meats, and packaged goods all typical of Latino cuisine and preferences.  Plus they have a tortilla factory right there if you want really fresh tortillas, and a juice bar that features guyabano and a few other unique juices, and you can also get some Latino cheeses.  The produce is pretty good, the cheese selection is interesting, the tortillas are pretty good, and some of the other products are nice.  They also have a cafeteria here that has some really good "Mexican" food (I say "Mexican" because some of it may not actually be Mexican).  The food is very tasty, and not very expensive.  Darn...now I want to get some of that food!!

Brand new store.  Just opened.  It's Microsoft's answer to the Apple Store.  However, I didn't notice anything resembling a "Genius Bar" (though the place was so crowded I could have missed it).  Basically just lots of Microsoft products for sale.  You could get them all at Amazon easier, and probably cheaper.  Without a service bar of some sort I don't really see the point.  I was able to see a Surface Type Cover on my smartphone for 25% less than they had in this store (and, in fact, I ordered one...saved $30 compared to this store).  If they have a service bar then add one star.  Otherwise, just go to Amazon and order what you want.

As the name says:  pizza and cheesesteak sandwiches.  Unique Philly sandwiches, plus the classic Philly. Also burgers and wings.  It was cool they had several variations of the Philly (not a fan of Cheez Whiz, which is the traditional).  The sandwiches were very good.  If you were going to Subway why not come here instead?  Seemed fresher, tastier, and you can even get fries if you want them!  Didn't have a pizza, so I can't speak to that.  Good find.  Probably not as good as Emilie & Carlo's in Chandler, but a lot closer to my house.  I think you will not regret coming here.

Came across a Restaurant.com certificate for this.  So when we show up there is a meat case selling salame and a few other things, and a really big blackboard listing all their sandwiches.  They have both hot and cold sandwiches.  It took a while to make a choice.  I ordered the (hot) pork sausage, and my wife ordered the (cold) salame, prosciutto, asiago, mortadella.  Plus we got the beef soup.  You can order half or whole sandwiches except for one or two of their sandwiches.  They have their own in-house made bread, too.  When the sandwiches arrived they were very big.  We both liked our choices, and the beef soup too!  One thing about their bread is that it is not wimpy sliced bread from the store.  It's crusty and chewy.  The bite force necessary to get a bite sends the other ingredients shooting out the other side!  I ended up using a knife a fork instead.  This is a good neighborhood deli.  Not like Subway or Quiznos.  Much better.  Better ingredients, more choices, better bread.  And it's not a chain, it's owned by a couple.  I think we'll be back.

First, I've never been to Peru.  So I can't really say if this is authentic or not.  It could be.  But I will have to write this without being able to affirm this.  This is a small place tucked-away in a tiny plaza on the corner.  I like such places!  As the name says, this is supposed to be Peruvian cuisine.  Our table ordered paella, asado pure, alfajores, and lucuma ice cream.  The asado was not what I think of as 'asado', but that's fine.  Seems every former Spanish colony/territory has their own version.  It was tasty.  The paella also was pretty good.  The others at the table liked it more than I did.  Then came dessert...the alfajores are a sandwich cookie (very dry cookies with a dulce de leche filling and powdered sugar), and the ice cream is based on a fruit that grows only in the Andes.  Both were very nice.  The ice cream (helado) was unique...not a flavor I've ever encountered before.  Service was a bit inattentive, but maybe because they were busy and she was the only server.  Overall it was tasty and different.  I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but the others with me seemed to think 4, so 4 it is.  I think we'll be back to try a few of their other dishes, and I'll update this review afterwards.

We should really come here more.  Yeah, it's sort of a dive.  I've been in third-world countries (though not Peru) and this is sort of how their restaurants look.  So in a way the atmosphere works.  This time I had the lomo saltado.  It was very good.  They also bring out these fried corn niblets and dipping sauces...those sauces are crazy-good! Also ordered was the jalea, which is sort of like a paella.  It was very good. And it's really cool that they have some Peruvian drinks, both their version of cola (Kola) and two different fruit drinks. The flavors are unique and good.  We ended it all with a helado lucuma (Peruvian ice cream).  Again, a unique flavor.  We liked it.  I'm definitely a fan.  The only blemish is that service is a bit spotty.  Very friendly, but not very attentive.  I did say "not good for kids" because I'm not sure kids would like these flavors.  Depends how adventurous your kid is.  For example, the ice cream is NOT vanilla.  It's truly unique, and junior may or may not go for that.  Hence my "not good for kids" when YELP asked that question.

Really good donuts.  Probably as good as Bosa.  Made fresh on-site, or so the lady claimed.  Their donuts seem a little smaller than Bosa's.  And they are not convenient for us (we just happened to be next door and spotted them).  But I would come here again if we were in the area.  The smoothies are made fresh.  It takes several minutes, but that's OK.  It's really fresh and not pre-made.  My wife liked hers!

New location.  But it's still Bosa.  Very good donuts.  Don't kid yourself that these things are healthy, because they aren't.  But they are really good!  Like other Bosas they have boba drinks and coffee and tea, and some breakfast sandwiches.  Bosa is my preferred donut joint when i decide I'm going to be unhealthy for a day.

Happened to be in this plaza and saw this place.  A quick check on Yelp and I was intrigued.  Puerto RIcan food, and some good ratings.  So we decided to try it!  The place is tiny.  The owners are a brother and sister.  The brother is out front, and very gregarious.  And very helpful.  After some discussion we ordered the pollo guisado and the bistec empinazado.  Both come with beans (like kidney beans) and rice (either white or "con gandules").    The pollo was almost like a chicken stew.  The flavors were simple, but good.  My empinazado was almost like a chicken-fried steak.  Again, simple flavors but good.  Maybe a little salty.  The beans were surprisingly good.  They aren't just beans, but have other stuff (and seasoning) in them.  Same for the rice.  Good stuff.  Portions were large, and service was responsive.  It's nice dealing with the owner.  He actually cares about the business!  I also got to sample the pork pernil.  The only reason I didn't order it today is because I wanted to sample as much as possible this visit to see if I wanted to come back.  The pernil was really nice.  I think we will be coming back to try a few other things.  The food is simple but good, and I like supporting one-of-a-kind restaurants as opposed to chains.  A sampler platter would be a good idea for the menu.

We were drawn in by the many 5-star ratings.  We've been twice now.  First visit we ordered several things including the "crispy panang".  That is not traditional Thai, but it turns out the uncle who is the chef likes to experiment.  I can get behind that!  It was unique and good.  So now we've had a second visit.  Seems to be a family affair (the uncle is the cook, per the waiter who must be the nephew).  I went with "drunken beef noodles" this time.  I also ordered one step hotter than last time.  Well, the heat was actually less than last time.  One in our party ordered "Thai hot" and reported to me that it wasn't even close to Thai hot.  They need to work on getting the heat consistent (i.e. when I order a "3" it should be of a given hotness, and not less than the "2" I ordered last time!).  But the flavor was good and the portion was reasonable.    I ordered off the lunch menu so the price was quite reasonable.  The crab puffs didn't seem very Thai, though, and the "soup" was really weak.  Nice that those things come with lunch items, so I will give some bonus points for value.  I'm sure we'll be back.  But I just can't say this is 5-star.  It's good.  And I like the chef experimenting with things like crispy panang.  I think if they improve the soup, get the hotness consistent, and keep up the good flavors I might be able to go to a 5-star rating.  I can recommend this place to anyone who wants Thai food.  I've already flagged two Thai coworkers, and I am looking forward to their feedback also.  (Also, I have been to Thailand.)

I learned of this place while trying to use a Restaurant.com credit.  Yelp seemed to have good ratings, so I used the credit and bought a certificate for Miele's.  They center it is in is a bit dodgy.  NW corner of Dobson and Guadalupe.  It's next to the Pawn Shop.  Upon entering the decor is absent.  It's really just a small podium and several blank walls.  What did I get myself into?  But from the podium they led us down a nondescript hall into the dining area.  The decor here was still a bit lacking, but better.  "Romantic lighting", several small tables...starting to feel like a bistro!  When we arrived there was quiet live music.  I should comment that the music was really nice.  Not at all Italian, but I liked that the musician wasn't blaring.  It was nice background music that allowed people to have a conversation without yelling.  We were seated at one of a small number of tables.  (Reservations might be a good idea...most of the evening I didn't see more than 1 or 2 empty tables, so I can see them being packed sometimes.)  They have an extensive menu.  Almost too much.  How can a small bistro kitchen cope with so many different dishes and maintain quality?  After looking at sandwiches and pizzas and different chicken dishes and veal dishes I settled on the bolognese.  Properly done this should not be "spaghetti and meat sauce".  My wife ordered chicken toscana.  We also got the calamari appetizer.  The calamari was good.  Simple, but good.  Not rubbery at all, nice light crunch of the breading.  Done well.  At the same time they brought out "house bread".  They make it themselves.  It's really good.  As good as any bakery.  The entrees came with a house salad.  My wife liked it.  I don't do salads, and they would not substitute for a soup.  I could order a soup, but no substitution.  Annoying.  My bolognese was really good.  Perfect, really.  Portion maybe a bit small, but the pasta was done properly and the bolognese sauce was dead-on.  Very flavorful.  My wife loved her toscana.  I didn't particularly (it was 'ok'), but she was very happy with her choice.  I mean really happy with it!  The bistro is owned by a middle-aged couple.  It's not a chain.  The chef has worked there since before this couple owned it, or so they told me.  I think as long as that chef is there we have a new favorite Italian place.  Yes, they are more expensive than the Olive Garden.  But they are so worth it if you love Italian food.  We are looking forward to trying them again very soon.

I like Dr Khurana.  She is caring, and never seems to be rushed to get out of the room.  She spends as much time as needed.   This office is nice because they seemed even less stressed, less rushed.  But it is way out in Queen Creek.  Dr Khurana is only here on certain days, though.  Overall, this seems to be a very good pediatric office.

This appears to be an extension of the Mekong Supermarket that is just one mile north of this location.  Seems kind of odd to place the new store here.  It will cannibalize business from the old one.  Kinda dumb, really.  But let's proceed.  There will be some comparisons to the old Mekong also.  First, I agree with some of the other reviewers that there is no organization.  You almost have to go up and down every aisle because it is difficult to predict where a specific item will be.  I would think sorting it by type of food (e.g. Filipino, Thai, Japanese, etc) would make the most sense.  But it's not really like that.  We never did find the Shoyu.  The meat counter is different.  I sort of like the design, but the one at old Mekong was fine also.  No tanks of live fish here, though.  My wife said the meat counter didn't smell right, and so she didn't get the ground pork she wanted.  They appear to be calling this "international" because they now have a Hispanic food section (about 1/4 of the store in the northwest corner).  That's probably not a bad idea to feature such foods given the large Hispanic population in Phoenix, but they don't compare well to the Ranch Market stores in that regard.  Or even Food City, for that matter.  One surprise in the Hispanic area was boxes of eggs not refrigerated.  Just piled up in the aisle.  That has to be a health violation, and I will probably be calling it in on Monday.  Eggs must be refrigerated, I'm pretty sure.  It does give cause for concern regarding how they handle perishables like eggs and meats.  And speaking of aisles...  Just like the old Mekong they have too many pallets on the floor.  On the east side of the store it was pretty annoying as you couldn't get two carts to pass one another in the aisle (or what was left of the aisle after they put the pallets there).  On the plus side, there is more space in aisles where they didn't stack up a bunch of boxes and pallets compared to old Mekong.  The produce area was reasonably large with a variety of (mostly Asian) fruits and vegetables.  There is a lot of redundancy , though.  We found items in this area that were repeated in regular aisles elsewhere.  Not really a problem for consumers, but an inefficient use of space (and furthers the criticism by many including me that their organization of this store is really poor).  I agree with the reviewer who said that it is likely either this store or the old Mekong will close within a few years.  It just doesn't make sense having two Mekong-like markets within 1 mile of each other.  This one feels less cramped than old Mekong, but also less organized.  And the meat area and the handling of raw eggs did not inspire confidence.  At this point I think I prefer the old store.
