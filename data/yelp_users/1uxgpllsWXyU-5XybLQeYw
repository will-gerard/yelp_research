For several weeks my wife had been eyeing this place as we made trips to the near by Walmart.  On a whim one evening we decided to stop by and grab a treat.  Upon entering we were kindly greeted and then seated.  Using my normal test, I ordered the yellow tail, salmon, albacore and mackerel; we also ordered a few rolls just to round out the meal.  After a short wait, our food was served.  Upon my first bite into the mackerel, I was instantly transported home.  Tasting the mackerel my mom used to make, rich and full of umami without being overpowering, and a great balance  no fillers, just pure mouth watering fish.  For the first time in months I had be taken back by food.  I actually spent the time to savor that order, so I could enjoy every second of it.  The rest of the fish was all very good, had a great taste, and very tender.  The albacore and yellow tail were especially impressive, both had a creamy light flavor that speaks volumes on the quality of fish.  The portions were also great for the price, I was completely satisfied by what I was given.  The next trip we take to Walmart, we will surely stop by again.

I ordered the Land of Enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak.  I was very happy with the proteins, the prawns and steak were both cooked very well, and were both seasoned expertly.  My only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place, almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish.  My plate also felt very cold, so I imagine the timings just weren't right in the kitchen.  The service was excellent though, and the atmosphere of the place was great.

This has to be the worst BevMo location I have ever been to.  Not only are the staff unwilling to help you find what you're looking for, but the stock is horrible.  I have never been greeted when visiting this location, nor have I been asked if I need help while looking through the store.  The one time I did ask for help I was vaguely pointed to an aisle and then told to look there.  When I returned still not finding what I needed the staff member told me to wait while he looked up the item on his computer.  The staff member then proceeded to help other customers and never followed up..        I really don't understand whats up with this particular location as I almost always have great experiences at Bevmos.  Beyond the terrible staff, the fact they have a terrible selection really seals the deal in my dollars going somewhere else.  Do novelty snacks and knick-knacks really out sell beer?  Only word of advice I can give is just make the drive and check out the other locations around town.

I visited this place with a group of co-workers after work looking for a good margarita.  This was definitely the correct choice!  I myself ordered the Premium margarita with Penasco tequila, no salt, and on the rocks, and let me say WOW!  What a great drink, they didn't skimp on the pour and didn't over do it with flavors.  It really hit the spot after a long day.  Although we only ordered a couple appetizers, the food seemed to taste ok for being a basic nacho plate and a large quesadilla.

I scheduled an appointment here through their website which was simple and quick.  When I arrived for my appointment I was greeted kindly, checked in and offered a drink.  My wait was very short and I was introduced to my stylist Vanessa.  She was very courteous and asked me several good questions before my haircut.  I had pictures of exactly what I wanted and she worked with me to get me there.  I went from a full shaggy look to the great undercut styled look I wanted.        Vanessa was also very pleasant to speak with.  She kept a good conversation, while still maintaining a professional composer, always paying attention to what she was doing.  I can say this was the first haircut I've had where I put my full confidence in the person cutting my hair.  Even after the haircut she made it a point to let me know how to maintain the look I wanted and how to style the way I wanted.      I have to say this Salon D' Shayn hit it out of the park and I'm extremely happy I selected this location.

This place is my jam!!  So far I have only tried the ox tail and the jerk chicken, but both dishes were fabulous!  The ox tail was melt in your mouth delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I do not think I left a scrap of meat or cartilage on the bones.  The jerk chicken was exceptional and was everything I was hoping for.  The sauce was tangy, smokey and had a bit of spice.  The chicken itself had a nice browning and was very moist.  The sides they serve are rice, fried plantain and a mixed steam vegetable.  I was honestly surprised at how well seasoned everything was.  The rice was fragrant with spices and the vegetables had just the right touch of salt.        I also tried the homemade ginger beer, and it was phenomenal.  Sweet and tart with a great ginger spice.  Nothing more refreshing then homemade ginger beer on a hot day!        I love this place and I cannot wait to go back again!  Beyond the delicious food, the staff are super nice and the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back.  If you're looking for some authentic Caribbean food, you NEED to hit this spot up.

On a whim my wife and I decided to try this restaurant.  Having minimal expirience in Indian cuisine we were quite hesitant.  Upon being seated we were greated warmly by the owners wife and given a full run down on their offerings.  She was SOOO helpful!  The suggestions she gave us upon learning our tastes, were exceptional!  For myself I had the Lamb Vindaloo, while my wife had the Channa Masala; we also shared an order of Papri Chaat for for our appetizer.       I must say the food was outright 5 star delicious.  The depth of flavor was astonishing.  The Papri Chaat was a refreshing mixture of sweet, spicy, creamy and crunch.  I have not had anything like it before, it was like an advanced nacho made a trip to India.        As for the main course the lamb Vindaloo was a hearty, very filling dish of spicy curry and lamb.  Nothing too crazy, but exactly what I was looking for in my first dip in Indian cuisine.  It had a bold flavor of onion and red pepper, with just the right amount of kick.  The chunks of lamb were large and really added a rich meaty flavor to balance out the dish.  We also added a portion of naan and rice to our order.  The naan was very tasty, and the rice was cooked perfectly.        To add on to an incredible meal, the price was extremely fair.  I was actually shocked at how little we spent. Im honestly in love with this place and plan to return as soon as possible.

This is a clean little rest stop.  They have a nice group that manages it and they maintain it with pride.  The vending machines accept credit card, so don't worry if you don't have any cash.  There is also water available if your car needs it or for any other needs.(just don't use more than you need!)        There isn't much to see besides the surrounding mountains but there is some interesting literature posted around the rest stop about historical topics.  Something to keep your mind busy if you're waiting on someone.  Also parking is ample so finding a spot should not be hard.        All in all, this is a good rest stop, that is clean and has a good staff.  I would suggest checking it out if you need a bathroom break or want to stretch your legs on a long drive.
