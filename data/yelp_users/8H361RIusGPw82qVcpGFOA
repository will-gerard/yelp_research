Someburros is an excellent fast, great quality Mexican food. It could honestly make the cut for a food network show for fast food,fast service delicious Mexican with that blonde spiked hair dude, Guy.  Try the pollo/shredded beef fundido or the classic tacos... Mmmm. The hot sauce is not for the faint heart, it's awesome.

1st appointment- misdiagnosed. "We have to order a water diverter and/or whatever piece necessary."   2nd appt.-  "We were out of that piece, we are going to home depot." Are you serious? Why wouldn't you just drive there get the part then come back and get the job done and done right the first time? punctual is not in these people's vocabulary- they didn't even come btw, I had to actually goto work... they should try that.   AWFUL EXPERIENCE. Plumbing company that doesn't work on weekends, are you serious? You expect people to miss 3 or 4 days of work for your incompentence? DO NO USE THESE PEOPLE.

Very dissatisfied with the customer service...  I frequently eat at smash burger and every time I order half regular fries half sweet potato fries and it has never been a problem. Today on the other hand, the manager explained that it was difficult to be done and tried giving me a lecture. It made me feel as if I were an inconvienence.    IT'S ALL ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE, an additional amount if necessary would of been fine.   I WILL NEVER GO BACK and speak all negative things when asked.   Smash Burger, I expect a response if you would like to rectify this situation and have a good patron return.

Matta's has a very pleasing atmosphere, nice furniture and friendly staff.  I goto restaurants to eat though. The food was so boring and bland. It made me sick that they overcharged for Taco Bell shells, picante canned salsa, and slop style presentation.   I recommend Serrano's. Never eat at Matta's. horrible food, horrible.

First of all.... CHEESE CURDS!!!!! AMAZING!   second... my experience. I went through the drive through, where they told me to pull forward because they were making my food fresh. I waited 5-7 minutes as expected. when they brought my food out, they apologized about my wait and gave me a free $5 or $6 ice cream container.   I appreciate the customer service and will return frequently. In tough times, customer service wins business.

Spoke with service department and set an appointment for an A1 service for a C250... They quoted 585 plus costs for wipers.. I looked in the manual for a C250 and 30k miles or 3 years, it did not need all the items they discussed. Very shady. I'll take my business elsewhere.
