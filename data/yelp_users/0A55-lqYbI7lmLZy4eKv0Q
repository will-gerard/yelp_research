Worst shop I have been too in a while. I used to come here all the time when Joe ran this shop and ever since he sold it, it's gone downhill. The guys that work there are the complete worst. Don't waste your time here.

Great customer service with these guys! Not like the other sketchy contractors floating around Phoenix. Task pros completely revamped you home. I bought it as-is and they came in and made it look like a custom home for a fraction of the price I was thinking. I would trust these guys for any job of mine.
