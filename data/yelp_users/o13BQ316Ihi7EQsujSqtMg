I came here for my husband's company Christmas party, which means I didn't pay for the meal - thank goodness. Why anyone would spend $60 on a chain restaurant meal, I'll never know. It was a very uninspired, basic steakhouse taste experience, gluey mashed potatoes and all. If you consider yourself a foodie, this place is not for you.

This is my go-to taco spot on the weekends, even though it's so far from my house. The carne asada is where it's at. Praise the taco gods for reasonably sized $1 street tacos -- and honestly, these are a lot tastier than whatever prissy $4 taco you could get at Joyride or some other such trendy joint. These are the real deal. The truck is amazing actually; it's a bonafide industrial kitchen in that thing. The outdoor eating area isn't fancy, but the food is so good, you won't even care. I always get a few asada tacos and occasionally a $2 mini quesadilla (because cheese). And they're open late! Hashtag blessingsonblessingsonblessings.  *Pro tip #1: You can ask for grilled onions and they give you a pretty sizable plate. Can't remember if it's free or an extra $1, but either way it's worth it if you like onions. *Pro tip #2: Their bottled sodas are a little small for my soda loving husband. We usually stop at a gas station for route 44s before heading over for tacos. *Pro tip #3: The truck/bar is only a mile or so away from Churn, so there's that...

I was on a very particular, restrictive diet when I ate at the Cutting Board, which can get pretty bland when you cook for yourself. Maybe I was just starved for something good, but the Soul-Full Bowl I ordered was absolute heaven. Portion was large and hearty with a good balance of veggies, grains, and flavors (tahini + hot sauce is a winner -- who knew?). I ended up buying a jar of that yummy hot sauce before I left; it kept well in the fridge for quite a while and was a staple in all future homemade bowls. The folks behind the counter were very kind and accommodating. I wouldn't come here if you are looking to get something fast, but I'm a firm believer in slow food. Good things take time! I will definitely be back again.

I can't say enough good things about OT. I only go for 8 sessions a month and I'm still reaping all the benefits (just participated in their 6 week weight loss challenge and lost 10 lbs!). It's always an amazing workout; I burn an avg of 600 calories every time! I'm always challenged to do better, lift heavier, and run faster. My overall athleticism has improved so much since I started. The trainers are all fabulous people who know so, so much about health and fitness and who make the workouts interesting. The studio is up to OT standards--always perfectly clean, and never crowded since workouts spots are scheduled. People at the front desk are always cool. Location is so close to home. Everything is amazing. Love, love, love OT and will never go back to a regular gym again!
