Soooo disappointed - been going here for years for the guacamole salsa, and tonight we find it's no longer there.  On top of that, the shrimp burro which is my all-time favorite now comes full of green and red peppers and onions and very few shrimp.  The menu does not say anything about green and red peppers, and when we went back up to the counter, we were told the menu has changed even though the changes are not noted on the posted menu and they weren't happy that we didn't like the changes.  After all these years of going there - not again!!!!!

We go at least a few times a month.  Small place with serve yourself chips and salsa.  Efficient and pleasant staff.  I love Mexican food, but do not eat meat, so this place is great because it has shrimp and fish - doesn't just limit me to beans.  And it's all good - hubby has tried a variety of dishes, but I love the shrimp tacos!!

even though we made a reservation for 3 people to go to the airport the driver showed up and was surprised to see three because he carries a child's car seat with him. It's a nice thing to do but the luggage filled up the trunk so the car seat had to sit in the back between two of us and banged around and bounced around and it was a very tight and very uncomfortable and I now have a bruise on my arm from it. I have never used Uber because I was not sure who or what was going to show up, but next time I will.

Have gone there regularly for several years, but the last time they had a new - and higher priced - menu.  A couple of us ordered salads for $14-16 each and were so disappointed that they were mostly greens with just a small amount of whatever were the toppings.  Way way too expensive for the little bit of stuff that was in it.  Another friend's fries were cold, but they did replace them.  Not likely to be going back there any time soon.

Just waited over 40 minutes in drive thru line because the clerk couldn't find something for the car in front of me and didn't bother too get anyone else to help the rest of us.  Have had a problem of one kind or another every time I've gone there up but never to this degree.  I'd switch in a minute if I could

Yum!!  Salmon and quinoa was delicious and special of the day flatbread with pear cooked in white wine with bleu cheese and arugula  Service was delightful.

Went up tonight - so confusing.   Line is closed,  everything is changed but no one says anything.   We finally ask and are told they're changing to Panera.  So sad - Pantera menu is much more limited.  I'm vegetarian and no good choices.  When someone finally comes to take order,  old menu still being used so we order and pay - then they don't have this and that but can make do with other things.    Never mind - we canceled.   So sad -was a regular so for us - guess not any more!

It doesn't look like there was any cleaning done on the inside of the car everything is dusty and spotted and dirty.  I was going to call them and let them know until I read the reviews on this and Google and realize this is just par for the course for them. I won't be going back

What a great find!  We'll definitely be back!!!  Healthy choices, love the ability to choose the items that go into my meal (like Chipotle style)  and the service was super enthusiastc and friendly.
