I want to thank AZ Party Mart for going above and beyond for my company party.. Scott and his family were kind, courteous and just awesome. He custom made a balloon arraignment that was a first for the both of us, that killed it at the party and left everyone talking about it!! Thank you so much!! I look forward to using them again for our next party and so should you!!

Best carpet cleaner in Phx. Rob ( owner)is super genuine. It was very easy to get ahold of him and setup an appointment ..  Our place is 4 stories of stairs.. He had no problem and even put up these guards so that the hoses didn't scratch anything .. That kind of meticulous attention really goes a long way..  He spent the extra time on all our carpets made them look like brand new..  I've included some pics to show .. I highly recommend his service and will for sure be a repeat customer for life !!

I hate to break your bubble of great reviews but I recently had an awful experience with this company.   My wife and I stumbled into this place on March and thought we would treat ourselves to some custom denim. Nicholas the GM, seemed pleasant to work with and did our fitting for a pair of Men's denim Jeans and a ladies mini skirt. The next morning I called lawless denim and spoke with Nicholas the GM and asked if there was anyway I could request a special color threading, I informed them that I would be more than willing to pay extra. 2 weeks went by and not a single call back or email letting me know if this was possible. So I took it upon myself to walk into the store to see if there was any progress. When I arrived the GM Nicholas was not in and the other manager Melissa had but didn't seem to know what was going on so I requested to have Nicholas the GM call me. I waited another 5 days again with no call back so I took upon myself to call them again, this time Nicholas the GM answered. There was no apology for the lack of follow up and when I asked about the thread he said it would be too much work for me??  To say the least I was a bit disappointed with the fact that I waited all this time for nothing. The following day I decided to call again because I got the impression that Nicholas the GM made no effort to help me. This time I spoke to Melissa, I informed her of the issues and she informed me that they could get the threading I requested but now I would have to wait after already waiting 2 plus weeks I'd have to wait 7-10 day plus that didn't include the build time of the jeans so now I'd be waiting nearly a month with an additional cost of $289.  Yikes!!  I asked them to please compromise with me since I had been waiting patiently and had already informed the GM Nicholas that I would be happy to spend the extra money to get what I requested but now we were looking at a month later.   They were unwilling to compromise so I informed them to go ahead with the original request but that I would need them a day earlier then the deadline of 2 1/2 weeks. Melissa informed me that it would be no problem.   So then 2 days before I needed to have them I called again and was informed that I should come in for my second fitting. I came down on my lunch hour and the jeans were NOT READY!!!!! So I left and came back later in the day.   To say the least I was very upset at this point, I felt I had made many efforts and had a lot of my time wasted. Then to make things even worse when I came back the MATERIALS I REQUESTED WERE NOT CORRECT!!!! WTF??   Nicholas the GM, was back at the store and approached me and knew I was not happy. Instead of apologizing for his lack luster follow up or poor communication he just went about his day and pretended like nothing was wrong.  So as I was walking out of the store I noticed a denim shirt. I inquired about it and asked if I could get the shirt expedited so that I could wear the jeans and the shirt for my event. Melissa said she couldn't promise it but that they would do their best to make it happen. I informed her if she could make this happen I would again be a happy customer and to please inform the owner I would be ever so appreciative.  THE DEADLINE: I was called and was informed that my jeans were ready!! I was excited but then I asked about the shirt and was now told that NO EXTRA EFFORT WOULD BE MADE TO EXPEDITED THE SHIRT. So I told Nicholas the GM, if that was the case I no longer wanted the jeans nor the shirt and would like them refunded.  I requested to please have the OWNER ROMAN, call me because I thought it was imperative that he knew about what was going on in his store.  Instead at 3:30 I received an email from Nicholas the GM, no phone call from the OWNER ROMAN, instead Nicholas the GM was  informing me that it wasn't his fault blah blah blah and that he would refund the cost of the shirt but not the jeans.  So I wrote him back and said all I am looking for is a call from the owner or anyone who could please help me with this horrific experience!!   The next email  I received was to inform me that they no longer wanted to do business with me and to please pick up the jeans and bring in the credit card for the shirt so they could refund me.  IF YOU ARE A CUSTOM JEAN COMPANY YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO DO CUSTOM REQUEST AND BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE CUSTOMER END OF STORY  IF I COULD I'D GIVE THEM NEGATIVE STARS..

As a follow up to my issues at Lawless Denim-    I was able to speak with Travis earlier this week who actually seemed like a good guy and seemed genuinely concerned with the fraud that was committed by the owner, Roman and his clan at Lawless. Denim. Unfortunately for him after not hearing a response back from them I called to today to inform them that I recorded the conversations I had the other day with Travis, where they admitted they never gave me my merchandise, even though the owner Roman wrote to my credit card companies that he gave me all my merchandise at the point of sale.. . Hmmmm: and Travis was FIRED along with a few other staff members like Melissa!!!!! According to their staff member Lucas a Lawless Denim.. Wonder why huh??   1.   When you are a custom shop who has to make everything  from scratch and you clearly give an estimated Bullshit  delivery date on the receipt, prob not a good idea to lie to a CC company and say you gave it to the customer at the point of sale.  2. I have a recording of your employee admitting that my jeans and shirt were never given to me, and are still at the store or were never made.  3. I also have an employee admitting that you purposely committed fraud because you assumed I was contesting the entire charge  and was being a " Deuche bag " which is not true because other patrons had done this before  to Lawless, according to your staff...   I hate to see how you are going to do business when you lose the ability to take credit cards...  BTW isn't it like a 100 plus Degrees in PHX... Prob not a good time for selling jeans in AZ

Things have changed at Lawless Denim!!!     It might of taken almost a year, but Lawless Denim has totally redeemed themselves!! After cleaning house and getting rid of the bad apples they had working for them, they are now newly staffed with amazing employees and I want to be able to share with everyone that they made things right with me !!! In my book that goes a LONG WAY!!! I have recently been dealing with a new manager at Lawless named Jim Fuentes, and this guys knows how to take care of his customers.. He called me up and explained to me that they wanted to make things right..   And that he did!!!   I am totally stoked that I will be receiving my new denim jeans, on time and the jeans are amazing. I always knew they had an amazing product and I am truly happy that Jim and the rest of the crew at Lawless reached out to me.. The customer service I have received has been outstanding and a big kudos to Jim and the rest of the crew at Lawless Denim...    I will be making some major purchase ASAP.. Now they have customer service that matches their amazing products... Sky is the limit for this company!!  Thanks again!!

There are several choices when choosing insurance companies but in my mind there is really only one place I'd go. Brock and his team set the bar extremely high. They are extremely thorough and provide a level of professionalism that is unparalleled to any other place. The best part of their service is they make you truly feel like a friend/ family. It is truly a pleasure to refer anyone to Brock and his office. Can't say enough good things. Go see him!!!

Michael is the man!! He truly puts in the the time and attention to detail when getting me cleaned up.. The location is somewhat hidden but once you find it it, Michael makes all of his clients feel welcome. The price is always right and I have been exclusively using Michael as my barber and will remain loyal. He is so dedicated he even came in on his day off. I get tons of compliments on my hair and beard. Give this place a try you won't regret it!!
