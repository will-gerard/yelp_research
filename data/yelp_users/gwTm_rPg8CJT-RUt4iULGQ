I realize that they don't care about customer service, but spending over 30 minutes on hold every time is a bit of a smack in the face.

Sunday happy hour is so cheap! If you come here, get the seared salmon roll! I don't even care for salmon, and its amazing!

This place was not expected on Mill Ave. Great food with a modern feel. Banana Foster French Toast was incredible. Smoothie was decent, but we came for breakfast anyway. If you want me to rate the smoothies I would say 3 out of 5... Breakfast was an easy 5 out of 5 stars. Do not avoid this place assuming it is the typical Mill Ave dive, it is worth the trip no matter where you live.

Perfect job on my auto tint! They came to my work, gave me the options, and were finished in about an hour. Great price and looks amazing.

Great sandwiches loaded with meat, and $6.50 for the combo is a great deal!

Large beer selection and a great food. There is also a big patio out back to enjoy the milder months.

You won't believe this, but the best bbq in North Scottsdale is at a gas station. They have a large menu with innovative choices. The kicker is that you also get to choose your bbq flavor! My personal menu favorite is the BBQ Pulled Pork tacos, but my favorite bbq sauce is still undecided. The Low Country is a sauce with bacon, bell peppers, and worcheshire. The Texas Chipotle is a sweet and spicy sauce. Both are friggin' fantastic, so you can't lose!

First off, I'm not a breakfast person. I always skip breakfast spots because it all tastes the same to me. That being said...this place is amazing! I had no idea what to order, so I ordered the Nutella Crepe and the breakfast burrito crepe. The Nutella Crepe is mind blowing. The breakfast burrito is pretty good too, and I would definitely order it again. I'm pretty sure anything you order here is going be great, so check it out the first chance you get.

Walked in, ordered drinks, apparently it was the owner working the bar, who then wandered off to the office. After 10 minutes, reordered again after I realized the owner wasn't coming back. Hung out for an hour,  went to close my tab, found out they gave my credit card to someone else...no apologies.  Spent the next 20 minutes outside on the phone with the bank canceling my card, came back in to tell my friends 'goodbye', at which point the owner called me over to give him another credit card to pay for my drinks they had no track of...wtf? Not making this up.  I avoid writing bad reviews since service or food might be off for the night due to uncontrollable circumstances, acts of God, or someone is just having a bad day...but this interaction directly involved the owner, so there is no way to justify this.  Enjoy your bad review and the $40 tab Pho Cao. If I could have given you negative stars and Worst Shithole of the Year, I would have...Avoid this shithole.
