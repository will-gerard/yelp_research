I am a big fan of Ticoz. I've been going there for a few years and have tried quite a few items - and have never been disappointed. I recommend the Street Tacos - my favorite is the shrimp. The Street Tacos entrée comes with pinto beans and rice (well worth it) or you can get just the tacos in the bar during happy hour for about half the price.   Their calamari is awesome - especially with the spicy jalapeño lime sauce on the side. Sunday brunch has been excellent, and the mimosas are great.  Inside, it has a modern decor and they have a really nice patio out back.  I've introduced a bunch of people to this place and they all loved it too. I've never had a bad experience.

Love Sushi Ken! It's the only place I keep going back to...and it's a hike for me from downtown Phoenix, but totally worth it. Great prices - between $3.50 - $5.50 for sushi - and the fish is double the amount of rice. Rolls run between $5 - $9.50 and they have a great selection.  Like others have mentioned, it's not a fancy place - fine by me! It's very authenticate. Sunday nights it's pretty slow so you get fabulous service - and they're always fast to deliver the food. Tried the sweet and spicy roll for the first time tonight and loved it! The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is b/c i've been there when it's busy and the servers can't keep up.

yuk! the food was really terrible. bad soup, empty spring rolls, nasty dog food tasting dumplings. i don't know how you make crab legs tasteless, but they even managed to do that.   someone mentioned the bacon-wrapped shrimp - gross! the bacon was hardly cooked. the pork shrimp was even worse.   the orange chicken and the teriyaki chicken were ok. some desserts were alright - like the jello, ice cream, pudding, and cream puffs.   i'm pretty sure almost nothing that comes out of the kitchen is made with fresh ingredients.    i'll never go back and won't recommend to anyone!

Just got back from this place about an hour ago and was so peeved that i couldn't wait to write this review. I decided to wait until I ate the food, which I examined closely before doing so.  First, you have to park in their little parking lot down a little alley through a little gate. You can't pass anyone on your way in or out.  So we got in there and looked at the menu and went up to order. The man working there scowled at me and asked if I knew what I wanted. I had my daughter with me so we got the kid's slider and magic mushroom burger combos. it was $10.50 - a good price for sure. But the guy was rude and acted like it was such an inconvenience to be serving us.  There was one group of four in front of us. We went outside on the front porch to wait, and the group came out about 2 minutes later with their food. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. We walked in a few times to see if we saw any signs of food coming, but we didn't. One customer came in and picked up an order. We've now been there for 30 minutes, so I go in determined to find out what is taking so long. There's a sign up in the window that says "Closed. Be Back Soon." REALLY???  So, I stand there and wait to see one of these two guys and the curly-haired guy finally comes our way and I asked, "umm, is our food almost ready?" He gives me a nasty glare and says yeah, he's making it now. I was shocked at how rude he was and let him know that i didn't appreciate his attitude. he said "you're the one with the attitude."  I had to fight the urge to walk out or demand my money back, but we'd been there for 40 minutes already and it was confirmed that they were actually making our food.  Finally, after 45 minutes, he hands me the bag with the same rudeness and look of detest on his face.  I am appalled at the service. I don't know if he's the owner or the other old guy is, but i will NEVER go here again and i will never recommend them to anyone. The food was cheap and quite good, so I gave them a star for that. But guys like that should not be in this business if they have no concept of customer service. I hope people think twice before going here, based on the service alone.

Loved the first visit with the The Toluca Brizza (breakfast pizza); not impressed with the burrito next visit. Cool little place worth the visit. I'd take my friends here.

I went here yesterday and asked for a basic pedicure. I was seated immediately, in a massage chair to soak my feet and then waited, for about 45 minutes.  Then when the woman started, and asked what I wanted, I said the basic pedicure with a design added. So she proceeded to start and then asked me questions that I couldn't really understand. I recall her asking if I wanted my callouses removed, and I'm thinking yes, when you scrub them, scrub off the thick skin areas. The the next thing I knew, she's saying how other salons charge you for add-on's like this, but here, you get everything for $35, only. So, now I've unknowing gone from $21 to $35. It's my birthday. I'm treating myself. I decide to just go with it.  When she quickly finished the polish and toe design at the end and put on one quick top coat, and says, ok, you're done, thank you, and hands me the invoice. I tipped her $8.  Then I proceed to check out and the girl says, that will be $36 plus tax. I said, I thought it was $35.  She said, no, our prices went up. The price went up when I walked up to the front to pay, I'm thinking?  Now, I'm just ready to get out of there. It's been over an hour and a half, and I had other plans.  Then I leave, and as soon as I get home, I see my two toenails are totally messed up because they weren't dry. I don't want to go back because of the hassle, but since I already paid twice what I thought I would, I'll go back to see if they fix it.  Frustrating!

I ordered take-out last night from Los Taquitos, upon the recommendation of a friend and a few Yelp reviews. I ordered the shrimp fajitas meal  (meals come with rice and beans) and my daughter had the kid's meal with a bean burrito. We also ordered chips and salsa.  15 minutes to pickup, and it was ready when we got there.  The total was $16.75, which I thought was a bit high considering what we ordered.  The inside has an unexpected, modern bar with about five stools. The register lines are right behind those stools. It just seemed odd and out of place. The three women at the registers had their act together, but could improve on friendliness.  So, we paid and were on our way, and I remembered the lady on the phone telling me to remind the person who rings us up that we get a drink with the kid's meal. Indeed, we did need to go back and get the drink cup. I just would prefer that it wasn't my job to remind them of something when they could easily write a note or symbol on the bag to remind themselves.  So, we got home and opened it all up and tried it out. My shrimp fajitas came with the bare minimum...meaning no traditional condiments. Poor assumption on my part, I guess. None-the-less, they tasted pretty good, but nothing special.  Now the chips and salsa - I mean, how can you go wrong? You can go wrong when the salsa is so hot that it burns for your mouth for five minutes after one bite and you end up not eating them and wasting your extra $2.50.  One last issue. I noticed later that they charged me a dollar more than the price on their menu online.  Not sure I'll go back, but if I do, it will be to try the $1 tacos.

Me and my daughter went here for Thanksgiving dinner. It says in the restaurant description, not good for kids, but my 8 year old fit in fine. Maybe that's b/c it was a holiday.  The atmosphere is modern, trendy, colorful and just beautiful overall. The patio is as nice as the inside dining area.  We were able to easily make a reservation on Open Table for the same day. The Thanksgiving menu was very reasonably priced ($26 per person,) the valet parking was free and the hostess knew my name and when we walked in - probably b/c they read the comments section from Open Table in which I noted it would be me and my 8 year old daughter coming in for dinner! Nice touch.     On to the food; it was largely traditional with the gourmet twists you would expect. Everything was served family style, and it came with a salad and dessert. My favorites were the turkey, maple sweet potatoes, chorizo stuffing, gravy, dessert and mashed potatoes. The not so good was the bland salad and the brown butter Brussel sprouts, which were really undercooked.  While the atmosphere and staff were impeccable, the wait for our dinner was extraordinarily long. We waited about 45 minutes between when our salads arrived and our dinner arrived. Luckily, the ambiance and iPad photos distracted us. When I got the check, I noticed they only charged me $12 for my daughter, which was a pleasant surprise. I fully expected the pay $26 per person, as advertised.  In summary, I will definitely go back, try their normal menu and hang out with friends. I just hope the service is faster next time!

I moved in here in August 2013. In about October, I started having problems. But first, I'll start off with the good.  The maintenance guys are great. Very helpful, friendly and fast to fix things. That deserves one star.  Now for the bad.  I was harassed and stalked by another tenant and they did nothing about it. Then, that same tenant vandalized my car, and even admitted to it. They did nothing to correct the situation.  So, I moved out of my apartment in May 2014, and moved in with friends. My apartment at Cabana sat there empty while I still paid rent until my lease was up.  Then I get a call in July, and they want me to end my lease early. I agree to move out in the beginning of August instead of the official August 19th lease termination. Since I wasn't expecting this early move out, I didn't have a lot of money saved up for a new place and needed my security deposit back ASAP. Legally, they have 14 business days to return it. It's been 18 business days and they still have not returned it, in spite of my repeated phone calls, emails and finally contacting corporate.  I could go on and on, but bottom line, I'm mostly upset that they have not returned my security deposit within the legal time limits. According to the law, ARTICLE 2. LANDLORD OBLIGATIONS § 33-1321. Security deposits - they now owe me twice what they originally owed me. I doubt I'll see that. Will update if I do.

Amazing little place you would never expect in a strip mall. I took my daughter with me for a quick bite and we had the incredible shrimp spring rolls and orange puffs (chicken). For my entree, I had the ginger mint duck salad. While it was pretty tasty, it was really lacking in duck and the pieces were small and mixed in.  Next time, I'll try something other than the duck salad, but overall great place and will be back!
