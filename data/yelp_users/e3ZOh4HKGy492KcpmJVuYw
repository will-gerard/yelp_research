This is authentic Mexican food, and their tacos are pretty cheap. I liked the Carne asada, but the chicken was quite dry. Don't be fooled by the location, the food is good!

I've been here several times and always thought they did a descent job for their prices. However, I will say that I have never come out loving my cuts.  I was getting bored with having long hair and decided to go medium length.    It was a bad decision coming here to do so!! He layered my hair so far apart that it looks choppy. The layers are way too short and uneven. My  " side bang" are awful as well.   I even left a small tip,  but will longer be coming back because this was the absolute worst experience with a hair cut that I've ever had. I now have to wear my hair up for the next few months until my hair grows back

Great place for breakfast and lunch. They have descent portions for good prices. The service is also great every time that I've gone here. I especially enjoy their coffee !

One of my go to spots for thai food.  Their lunch specials are really great. I always get the drunken noodles . I love spicy food, so hot is perfect for me.  The only downfall to this place is the service, I have never gotten great service here it's just okay...

Their tacos are really good but expensive so try to catch happy hour or during lunch and you can get 2 tacos and a salad for $10. The salads are unique and refreshing, and I love how they put a good amount of avocado on almost everything ! :)

This is one of my favorite sushi places,  I've been going here since the first Gilbert location opened. I like that they give free soup, salad, and dessert. I like eating raw fish so I find the spicy tuna salad and their special rolls (red dragon etc. ) to be really good.   I am sad to read reviews about people getting sick. I hope that's not the case, and Masa is making changes to assure that doesn't happen again.

Christine is absolutely great!  She is very experienced and knowledgeable about what she is doing.  She is also great to talk to. Her and the boss made my experience as painless as possible.
