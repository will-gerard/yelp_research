Went here for brunch with a friend. Immediately upon walking in I loved the atmosphere. Very few choices on the breakfast menu but the food was good. The coffee was great and they probably have the best bagels I've ever had!!! Oh and make sure you try a corn cookie!

If I could go less than one star I would. I took my phone to the Kiosk in Arrowhead mall to fix the shattered screen on my iPhone 6. They took it and fixed it within 20 min. I don't know the name of the guy working at the booth, as he didn't introduce himself, just said yeah I can fix it $120. Took my phone and started working on it. Went back to pick it up and the screen looked good.  Later on when I started using it at home I realized there was a dent under the glass it now freezes from time to time and the color on my phone screen was really messed up, vertical lines appearing and disappearing, the color fades all over the place. It's now next to impossible to take pictures or video on my phone because i can't see what I'm shooting. I didn't pay that much money to walk away from that store with a phone less operable than it was when I dropped it off. I Emailed the contact that was listed on the E-Receipt explaining the situation and asking if any corrective action would be taken on this issue. I received a response some  days later with an email that read "please email this address". I emailed that address with yet another explanation of the situation and now a week and a half later I've gotten no response. Horrible customer service.
