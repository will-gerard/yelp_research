Nothing against this store at desert ridge, infact it's very nice..my main complaint is against Hollister itself...the sizes they have are ridiculous, an XL is actually about the size of a small, and they have no 2XL at all, I really don't know how they stay in business...GET SOME LARGE SIZES OR A BETTER SYSTEM OF SIZES!!

The place I tried was on union hills, absolutely terrible..pizza was over done, wings were bad and I felt like a fool spending $30.00 there for a terrible product.

Love the place and the atmosphere, the iced coffee is great and so is the food. They also let me hang my art up on the back walls...thx guys :)

Spent like $30.00 for a couple burgers and left very hungry..all that money and the burgers didn't even come with fries, also..servers were young and never around much..I had to get up twice myself and pour myself more water..they better do better than this charging these kind of prices in this economy.

I've been a member for close to 4 years or more now and the experience has been good. I use the service for auto repair, landscaping and food. I usually deal with Natasha over there and she is very good about getting back to me and getting things done.

The food industry is tough and these guys didn't knock my socks off, infact, they didn't even snag or give them a gentle pull...food was bland and something was off...I'll give em about 4 months before they are out of business...go to bryan's bbq in cave creek if you want good bbq.

Classy Jazzy has a lot of unique items and there is always something in there my girlfriend loves, service is always great as well, I would recommend them.  Carl Schultz
