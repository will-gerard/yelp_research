First sushi place I tried in Scottsdale with my gf.  To be honest I was nervous about the whole sushi in the desert situation.  Luckily I eventually found a few better places but the price and taste combo made Hiro sushi 2 stars easy.

It was AWESOME.  I had the green flannel and the lady friend had eggs benedict and we shared one pancake and bacon.  The pancake was  delicious. The French Press coffee was so good.  No sugar or milk necessary.  Just drink as is.

Extremely helpful and made me feel very comfortable.  Found these guys on Yelp.   The owner ( can't remember his name) even gave me a call a few days afterward knowing that I was driving back up to NY and wanted to make sure everything went smoothly.

Taco Tuesday was always a treat and the service at the bar was always great.  Thanks for being around the corner from where I used to live and making it way to easy to walk there.
