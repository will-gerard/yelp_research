Way better than Zipps. A sports grill that actually plays sports with the sound on. Servers who are awesome and without the attitude. One of my favorite places in the hood. Angie is awesome! Great spot for trivia

What kind of bar that calls themselves a "sports grill" won't put on the sound for a playoff NBA game and instead opts for horrible pop music because "the majority of the place isn't watching the game." change your name Zipps "pop music" grill. Smh.
