I have been going to The Roosevelt for almost two years and over time I've become less and less impressed.   At first it was a cool new place that not a lot of people knew about, but has since become increasingly more popular and crowded.  Ordinarily I would be happy to see a small local business thriving, but with it has come an attitude.    Case in point- I stopped by for a drink after a movie this weekend .  Some friends were coming to meet up so I ordered a glass of wine from the board while I waited.  It was awful, tasting like vinegar at the end.  I offered it up to my companion who confirmed it was bad, so I decided to ask for something else.  I waited for a bit but the server was MIA even though the place is tiny.  I went to the bar and explained to the bartender, who gave me a lecture on how they store the wine, what temp its kept at (54 for a red???) and said they go through it so quickly there's no way it had spoiled.  She assured me that it was lingonberry I was tasting that I probably didn't like, even though I love at the cafe in IKEA!  I didn't really know what to say in response to her history lesson so I asked if I could please have a glass of the Pinot instead.   She said of course and went to grab the bottle, then threw in, "But just so you know, I'm going to have to charge you for the first glass, so you might want to see if any of your friends want it." I told her to forget it.  The only "friend" had already tried it and found it equally disgusting, so we contacted our other "friends" and had them meet us at Bar Biano instead.  At least there you can have beer or wine and also sit outside.   We used to have frequent happy hours for work at the Roosevelt, but I won't be recommending it in the future.   This place combined with Matt's Big Breakfast is surely making a profit hand-over-foot, but they can't even bother providing decent service to the people who supported them before Food Network made them all the rage.

I contacted the owners about making a donation to a fundraiser and they were more than happy to help out.  I took a friend with me to have lunch and pick up the gift certificate.  We were both blown away at the Hana Bento box ($15 and I was stuffed with leftovers).  We split two desserts, the creme filled tempura and deep fried mango ice cream.  Both were great, though the chocolate sauce was almost too much sweetness.  The waiter was very attentive, and when we asked to split the check with two cards he was overly-apologetic about explaining the $1.50 fee per card, which we were happy to pay. I've heard amazing things about this place and I live nearby, so I'm kicking myself for not having gone sooner.  It is so fantastic and Lori and Lynn are philanthropists to boot!  Thanks so much you guys!

D'Lisa (politely) convinced me to wax my eyebrows and it changed my life...I give her props for helping me land my dream job because not only is she great at what she does, but just talking to her makes you feel good about your self!  Some people may do this type of work because they think its a quick and easy way to make a living, but D'Lisa works her ass off every day.  She cares about her clients and it shows.  She is committed to boosting the self esteem of others, men and women alike.  You can't help but feel sexy after spending five minutes with her.

A friend who runs a lot suggested I look up John's studio when I was in a bunch of pain training for my first Ragnar Relay.  I echo everything said here by the other yelpers...not only did John take time to ask me about my physical activity levels and inquire as to what I was hoping to gain from the massage, he made several polite suggestions on ways to improve my quality of life once our hour was up.  I used to have a monthly membership to a local spa and John said he is in the process of establishing a similar program at SPACE. As soon as that happens I am signing up! Definitely worth the money and I can't wait to go back.

I've already raved about the Scottsdale location but feel the need to tip my hat at D'Lisa for another successful venture.  I used to complain about driving all the way to Old Town for my personal grooming needs so she listened and opened a Phoenix location! Anyone who knows me knows I am a cheap SOB so I tend to do my own nails and eyebrows (for a few years I even cut my own hair!) but now I have no excuse to not head over to this incredible local business.  I read that funky nails are all the rage these days and the few times I've rocked them I got crazy compliments.  And who doesn't love compliments?! D, as always, I love the work you do and the passion you have for improving the world around you. Nobody puts more effort in to their career than you and it shows. Congratulations and thanks for everything!
