The Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort is like that girl you knew in high school who was absolutely gorgeous but had the worst personality ever; and was basically a vapid, selfish, jerk.  The entire property is gorgeous, with well-manicured gardens, decorative fire pits and fountains, and enough greenery to make me forget that it's still winter where I live and everything is dead outside.  But beneath the surface of the resort lies an incredibly greedy, corporation dedicated to nickel and dime-ing its customers until they're so resentful they never want to come back. Or at least, I am.   Nearly every room looks out onto a pretty courtyard, or a stunning lagoon. Except mine, which looked out onto a dumpster and an access road. My room was one away from being the absolute farthest point away from the check-in desk as possible. In the basement. My neighboring rooms were the ones they apparently use to accommodate people with dogs. Mine probably was too, but sadly my pets were not along for this vacation. My wife and I were the only ones privy to the beautiful rusting dumpster outside our patio.   Oh, we could've upgraded. For a fee. I did some reading and found that you could upgrade your room and be at regency status, which also opened the door to a nice lounge with free flowing drinks, breakfast and evening appetizers. But we'd pre-booked everything at the regular rate, and at more than $300 per night, plus the added resort fee and parking fee, we felt we'd paid enough for the privilege of being there.   But it definitely felt like we weren't good enough to be there. I could've spent a bit more and been upgraded but by the point I realized it was an option, I was already disheartened by the room and its lack of charm. Speaking of the room, it in itself was fine. But that's all I'd say about it. It was fine. There was nothing special or magnificent about it. The decor was fairly plain and nothing stood out to make you feel like this was worth $300+ per night. I've stayed in far nicer places for a fraction of the price.   Upon visiting the pool, we were treated to a wealth of swimming options but tended to stay in the adult pool area. Unfortunately, the heated whirlpool was not in this area and was in the family play area, absolutely filled with children-soup the entire time we were there. We weren't on a family vacation, but a quick weekend getaway for the two of us and other people's unsupervised children were not part of the plan. But there they were anyway, rolling around and splashing in what should've been a 16-and-older area. But that's just my opinion. You may disagree.   I can't tell how old the resort is, but the pool complex seems to be starting to show its age with crumbling cement and rusted fixtures. There were some nice cabanas available for rent. But nearby there were also those nice outdoor day-beds with the canopies you often find at resorts. But instead of them being first-come/first-served, they were available for a ridiculous daily-use fee.   The nickel-and-dime-ing continued. I logged into the "complimentary" internet, that was included as part of my resort fee and quickly found that I would only receive basic service, but I could (you guessed it) upgrade to decent quality service to watch Netflix and the like, for an additional fee.   But I think it was the paid parking that offended me the most. Again, when you're already paying for a room and resort fee I was downright mad when I saw that I also had to pay for parking, and didn't even get in/out privileges. Not to mention the fact that the automated pay-system wasn't working properly when we left during our first night. We pressed the HELP button multiple times, but nobody came, and I'm fairly certain it charged us twice. After swiping our credit card the machine continuously  requested that we push the receipt button, but nothing happened. There was no receipt and the gate did not go up until we inserted our credit card a second time. I will definitely be scanning my statement for any scams put forth by this machine.   Overall, had we had a nicer room with a better view, and a few of those add-ins that they are more than welcome to throw in if you pay them enough, I would have left feeling a lot more positive about this resort. But considering the shoddy money-is-everything feeling that surrounded my quiet weekend vacation, I certainly don't intend to return to this money-grubbing black hole anytime soon.

SWB was definitely the highlight of my visit to the Hyatt. On our second day we visited and had brunch and it was magnificent. The servers were attentive, professional and overwhelmingly friendly and polite. The spread was exceptional with choices for every person's palate. And the price, compared to everything else at the resort, was somewhat reasonable. If you visit, I recommend the bottomless mimosa. My wife had four. It was quite a treat.   Not to mention, the location is stunning. As most of the resort is beautiful, SWB is too, and we were seated just off on the main patio under a canopy and next to a large fire pit. The whole experience was serene as well as surreal.   While my feelings on the resort itself have been detailed in another review, I would certainly make time to revisit SWB if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again, just for the amazing brunch experience.

WOW! I want a place like this in Chicago. What a cool space. What friendly staff. What incredible food!   We stopped by here for a few light bites and a couple of drinks during our first day in Phoenix and were completely blown away by everything about The Duce. I only wish we had more time to hang out longer and sample more of the goodies they had to offer.   Not to mention the fact that it was super cool to see a couple casually stroll in with their canine companion. My wife and I were missing our four-legged friends something fierce and we would've loved to enjoy their company in this chill atmosphere.   Next time I'm in the area, this is a MUST visit. No complaints.   Oh, and be sure to order the mac & cheese muffin bite things. They're so good, they should actually rename them "AMAZEBALLS." (I hate myself for saying that). ((But it's true.))

Absolute best apple fritter I've ever tasted.   The donuts are absolutely incredible. The chicken is okay. The service will depend on who helps you.   As we waited in a long line to be served one of the workers was being incredibly friendly to everyone in line, calling out compliments to make everyone feel at home. "Stay cute, everyone," he said, garnering chuckles from the crowd. "We'll be with you guys soon!" He also took the time to visit all the tables and make sure people were enjoying their food and having a nice time.   That's quality service right there.   I only got to try the apple fritter and the cake donut that came with my chicken order, but I'd absolutely return. These are their specialty. This is what they excel in.  Unfortunately, I didn't really think the chicken was all that impressive. And the packaging was a bit lacking. The gal brought out my order in a regular eat-in basket, but I reminded her that my order was to-go. Sadly, the sauce was just packed loose in a small container inside the paper box my meal came in, so by the time I went to eat it, it had all but sloshed out. The chicken itself was pretty average. Maybe it would have been better if the sauce had been put on the chicken, which is how I was expecting it to be. But instead, I got regular fried chicken and a little cup of the sauce. I guess some of it got sloshed onto my chicken due to the lack of lid on the cup, but I think that was more accident than intent.   That said, I would only remove one star for the chicken because the service and donuts were all over-the-top amazing and I would come back any time I'm visiting Phoenix.
