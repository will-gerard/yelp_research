I loathe to write a bad review for one of my favorite hobbies, drinking craft beer, however; Sun Up is a brewing company that I feel the need to never visit again, nor would I recommend beer lovers to go out of their way to stop in.  The majority of the beer was just plain boring, and warm to boot! They had a lager, wheat, amber, pale, oatmeal stout and a scottish red on draft.  None of the beer sampled tasted even close to what I would consider the fundamentals of that particular category, ie a very bitter amber ale and a sweet, and not-hoppy-whatsoever pale ale.  Even the root beer was flat and tasteless.    I initially was going to give this place two stars, mainly because they do serve beer, and the bartender was nice,  but thinking about the beer, I have to knock this down to one star.  Sorry Sun Up, but you need to go back to the drawing board and create some good, basic craft brew.

This place puts out some darn tasty grub at an affordable price, with a hip crowd and daily drink specials.  I've only been for lunch (2 or 3 times), but each meal has exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely recommend the bruschetta, where you get to pick 4 out of at least 9 different toppings, which all come on toasted bread.  If I recall, the tomato jam and sheep's milk was my favorite, but I also enjoyed the apple, fig and brie, as well as the roasted red pepper and goat cheese.  My wife had the tuna sandwich and salad, and even with just a half sandwich, I still had to help her finish it...bummer.  Be prepared to valet your car, as both locations have limited parking, but you definitely feel like a celebrity dining at Postinos!

Wife purchased a cake here for my birthday a few weeks back, and it was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely come back here for future cakes!

I went to high school right down the street from Uncle Sams and it always has, and always will, serve excellent cheese steaks and pizzas.    This is another restaurant that I try to visit on every trip to the Phoenix metro area, and in my mind is one of the staple restaurants in the valley.  The food is inexpensive and is always hot and delicious.  The service is superbly provided by cute chicas in short mini skirts, but alas is NOT trashy like that other restaurant, Hooters.

First of all, I consider myself to be a donut aficianado, and would consider Dunkin Donuts chocolate glazed to be the penultimate donut around.  With that being said, I still give Rainbow donuts 5 stars because the donuts, including the chocolate glazed, are fantastic and fresh.  They have an extensive selection and are sure to make everyone in your sugar-crazed party happy.  Perfect for the after church crowd, and us sinners alike, Rainbow Donuts makes the best donuts in the valley!

The three different nines are fun to play, but don't confuse this with a country club. No real range to warm at and even the foam ball play area and putting green aren't in operation. Oh and BTW your tee time has been pushed back because the Men's Club had trouble teeing it up earlier. Too many other options in the Valley to play. Why come here? Doubtful I will again.

Papago Brewing Company not only makes decent craft beer, they have the best tap selection in the Phoenix metro area, BAR NONE!  Upon entering this establishment, inconveniently located in the Papago strip mall, you are greeted by a fat, cheery monk statue and a bustling atmosphere.  This place was happening, even on a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm, and we struck up conversation with locals and traveling beer enthusiasts alike.    As per previous reviews, Papago has an amazing selection of draught beer that rotates constantly, and I believe there were at least 10 new taps (of 25 or so) within our week between visits.  They offer a variety of domestic, craft beer, as well as a few Belgians and lagers from Europe, as well as a couple of their own brews (made off site). The beer that Papago brews was fair, with the Orange Blossom being, actually, really good. They are easily forgiven with all the other beer they have to offer and I was especially thrilled with the Left Hand Milk Stout on nitro...word.    In addition, they have a great bottle selection to enjoy on premise, or you can customize a sixer for around 8 bucks to take home.    I only have two complaints, one being that this excellent tap room is located in a strip mall in Phoenix...blah.  Talk about a crappy, traffic-ridden atmosphere for a wonderful tasting room.  I wish I could pick this establishment up and transplant it north of Cave Creek, or somewhere in the hills, and add a nice sun deck for enjoying the beer outside.    The second complaint is that the beer seems to be ordered in at random with no consideration for complimenting selections.  They definitely have a variety, however it seems like there were a lot of stouts in the spring, with very few lighter craft beer.  However, be reminded, that Papago Brewing is the best tap room in all of the Phoenix metro area, and if you are searching for a place to enjoy, discuss and sample craft beer from all around the world, look no further than Papago, you shan't be disappointed.

The only element that ever changes around here is taplist and the selection was outstanding, per usual, yesterday afternoon.  Oh yeah, and they remembered to place our food order...good times.

We have been going to Four Peaks for years and years because they craft excellent beer and have delicious food and great service.    If you've never been to Four Peaks, you are missing out!  They make the best beer in the entire metro phoenix area and have the most consistent service and selection around.  The food is usually pretty good, but it seems as of late, the quality has deteriorated a little.  Especially last time when we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and it appeared at the table in less than 2 minutes?  I mean, I was hungry, but would prefer to wait for a made to order bowl of dip, than be served one that was ladeled out of a giant vat!  The beer bread sandwiches are always excellent, as are the pizzas, and they have great nightly specials with seasonal ingredients.    We always have visited, and always will visit Four Peaks on each and every stop in the valley!

A nationally esteemed wood fired pizzeria in the heart of downtown Phoenix, this is the best pizza west of the Mississippi.  Forget all the fuss you've heard about extended wait times and long lines, blah blah blah.  Waiting here for a table is half the fun, so get your name on the list and chill out.  I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but if you don't want to wait for dinner, go at lunch.  We usually show up at 11:15 or 11:30 and wait no more that 15-20 minutes for a table.   The pizza perfect in every way, starting with the ridiculously crispy/soft/slighty-chewy/thin crust to the perfect blend of minimal toppings that compliment each other more than new couples in puppy love. The Biancoverde is my all time fav, but you must try the Rosa which is this amazing mix of red onion, parmigiana and pistachios...unbelievable.   Remember...don't hate...appreciate (that you have one of the best pizza joints in the world right in your backyard)

Ahh...Cibo...such a great restaurant and one of my top five pizza joints in the Valley.  Great atmosphere, the service is stupendous and the food is to die for.  Why no pizza at lunch though?

For some reason, my in-laws and friends enjoy eating Carolinas Mexican food for take out and eat in.  Maybe it's because the tortillas are fresh, and are actually good, when they are fresh.    Do not be fooled by any other review of this place, the food is awful in so many ways:  1.  So much salt! On the chips especially, but you can taste the sodium,   and probably MSG, in all the meals, and there is A LOT of it in there, trust me!  2.  If the tortillas aren't fresh, they are rock hard and indigestible  3. The beans are pureed to no end  4.  They cover their boring flavors and terrible enchilada sauce with cheese.  Everything had cheese, cheese and more cheese!  5.  Unfresh produce, with brown lettuce and mushy tomatoes.   Never again will I eat at Carolinas Mexican food, it must be some of the most unhealthy food I have ever ingested, and if you care even one iota about your heart and your health, you probably should avoid this place at all costs!

We stopped over at Lis Doon Varna following a spring training game in Peoria with a group of eleven people.  They weren't that busy and we got fair service, but the variety of traditional Irish dishes on the menu is definitely worth the visit.    They have a pretty good selection of draught beer to accompany your food, including Guiness (duh) Hoegarden and Smithicks.  But the food was the real attraction.  I had the lentil shepards pie, and although the portion was a little small, the dish made up the size in flavor.  My compatriots had the corned beef, fish and chips and a couple of chicken wraps, and everyone seemed happy with their meals.   The atmosphere of LDV is the most attractive facet of this restaurant with great decor and a unique floor plan, multiple bars and a substantial outdoor seating area.  I am under the impression that when they have trad music sessions, this place is hopping.

We've been here a few times for vintage cocktails and snacks pre-game or concert downtown.  $5 dirty gin martinis around the clock, with which you can't go wrong.  Other delightful and unique cocktails abound, so why not try something different.    The food is muy delicioso and we are huge fans of the onion straws, gorgonzola slaw and mushroom sandwich, as well as the flat bread pizzas.  Everything is reasonably priced and will not disappoint.  Had to knock them down a star because we went most recently with my 16 month old daughter and they don't have a highchair!  Must be a sure sign they are anti-kid, right?

To me, Blanco was just fair Mexican food, with a tiny bit of inspiration, however they try to pass it off as if this restaurant is the greatest thing since the scoop chip.  First things first, they have a michelada on their drink menu, but don't order it!  Even if you've had wonderful micheladas in the past, Blanco's is terrible, with WAY TOO MUCH worchester sauce and not enough lime...yucky!    The chips and salsa were actually really good, as well as the guacamole.  I had the ahi tacos, which were overseasoned, presumably to cover up the not-so-fresh taste of the fish.  My wife had a veggie burrito, which was huge in size, but not in taste.  The rice they serve with the dishes is to, die, for!  Next time I visit, if ever again, I am ordering just a bowl of the buttered rice...delicious.   The service at this restaurant was borderline terrible, from needing to ask for everything, including more chips and water refills, to waiting too long for food, which then came out on an extremely hot plate, as if it had been sitting under a window for far too long!  And again Blanco, why the attitude? The food is not that great, your servers aren't that hot and your drinks are weak, get over yourselves.

We utilized Gil and his crew at Gil's Taste of Taos to cater our baby shower yesterday afternoon.    These guys are true professionals and handled changes to the menu and head count without batting an eye. They were prompt to send over and invoice and a pleasure to deal with leading up to the shower.   They arrived at the shower at the scheduled time and did all the set up and subsequent breakdown at the end of the party.  They used the available space and made the buffet functional and tasteful.  Speaking of taste...the food was phenomenal and WAY beyond my expectations.  I had previously informed Gil of my love of the Hatch green chile and he ensured that the ingredient was center stage with our meal.  We opted for beef and chicken fajitas and he included both corn and flour tortillas.  There were chicken and beef burros, cheese and chicken enchiladas, whole beans, spanish rice, freshly made tortilla chips and all the fixings including guacamole, green and red salsa, sour cream and extra roasted Hatch green chiles!  Excellent, excellent, excellent job guys! The food and service were both outstanding and we will definitely recommend you for any catering needs.

Scramble is (mostly) a breakfast joint, hence the name, where you order at the counter, pay and take a seat while you wait for someone to deliver the food.    On my first visit I had the southwestern benedict with poached eggs, cornbread and chipotle hollandaise.  A little rich for my blood, but tasty nonetheless. The second time I visited I tried the veggie scramble, which was a much better choice.  Fresh veggies and eggs, with a little bit of cheese, alongside some great homestyle potatoes.    Definitely a fan of Scramble, as the food is freshly prepared, inexpensive and they have excellently strong coffee.

My wife and I first experienced the Mellow Mushroom pizza bakers in North Carolina, and were a little reluctant to visit their new operation in North Phoenix, however were pleasantly surprised with how consistently good their pizza pie is!  The atmosphere at this Mellow Mushroom leaves a little to be desired, with unimaginative decor and no unique feel to it, unlike both establishments we visited in NC, which were crazy localized.    The severs we had at this MM were both knowledgeable of the menu and of their excellent craft beer selection.  They feature beer from Sonoran and Papago, which are local brewers, as well as Rogue, and a few others from the left coast.  They claim to have an excellent selection of local, craft brew, which I agree that they have a better selection than most, but where are the Nimbus, Oak Creek and Beaver St beer?  Include the state of Arizona in your draft beer selection, I won't be disappointed.  Enough about appetizers, onto the pizza!  They have a great selection of toppings and some pretty creative specialty pizzas that are sure to please anybody who loves something different.  We frequently get the magical mystery tour and are never left hungry.  They dough is a little thick for my tastes, however, they sprinkle a little graded parmesan on the crust, making the entire slice devourable.  Mellow Mushroom is definitely a chain restaurant, however they stand far above the other chain pizza restaurants in the valley, and they are definitely worth trying.  Believe you me, you will become hooked, and this place will be your primary pizza destination!

This is our local joint and the place we go when we can't come up with a better idea and/or don't feel much like cooking.  Not to say that we could replicate what they produce or that there are better ideas for dinner, I meant to say 'Los Taquitos is our go to place for great food, friendly service and reasonable prices'.  Typically we get the veggie burro (bean, rices, potatoes, peppers and onions) with a side of bombero sauce (which is super delicious spicy goodness).  Chips and salsa is great as well, with a sometimes spicy serrano and red onion dominated, almost pickled salsa.  They also have a red and green sauce to vary up the bites on your goodies, but I typically roll bombero sauce.  I would probably drink the stuff if they let me.  Family and friends dig into the carne asada burros and street tacos and everyone we've taken here has been very happy with the food.  Check the specials board as it changes on occasion and we've had some great rellenos and tamales at Los Taquitos as well.

Just like Papago Brew, but with better beer, better food and WAY BETTER service.  Seriously, these guys know whats up.  Great happy hour on the local AZ beers at $6 for a pitcher (just over 2 beers).  They have an excellent selection and variety *gasp of beer on draft, but have the tendency to run out of beers rapidly.  I would consider this to be a good thing because they will always be getting a new, fresh keg of something delicious.  Food is excellent and there is a variety of meat and veg dishes from which to choose.  Most importantly, you order and they bring it promptly.    5 stars because they have an awesome sour beer on draft...Petrus aged Pale.  If you go to OHSO, do yourself a favor and give it a try.

With the string of gorgeous weather recently, I found myself in dire need of a bike to cruise my daughter to the park with and a 29er to hit trail the plethora of desert trails with, and these guys delivered a SMOKING deal on two bikes last week.  Thanks a million!  In an attempt to avoid buying more cheap shit from China I wanted to buy a few USED bikes, however my craigslist karma cosmically sucks for some reason and I had such trouble locating good used bikes free from deceit and general douche-baggery.  These guys are the real deal.  Down to earth and straight forward.  Great used bikes (and some new) at fair prices, and don't be afraid to haggle a little.

The pizza is pretty good and unique, and if you like doughy crust you'll be happy. Plenty of options for veggie heads and meat eaters alike.  Great tap list, I just wish someone would come over and offer to get me another beer. Really poor service up to this point, probably won't be back. There is another one at Norterra, if you really care that much.

This place is the shiz, and we are so happy to have one right down the street from our humble abode.  Definitely New Mexican cuisine with green and red chile on pretty much everything.  I usually opt for the green chili cheese enchiladas, which have a awesomely spicy sauce, fresh thick corn tortilla and a fried huevo as the icing on the cake...so good!  Of course comes with rice and beans and is a healthy portion for the price.  Chips and salsa are superb and we debate each visit which is spicier, the red or the green.    I see a few bad-mediocre reviews of this place on Yelp and fools be trippin!  If you want spicy Mexican food, look no further than Los Dos Molinos, you won't be disappointed.

This place continues to wow with an awesome rotating tap selection, unique craft beers and bustling atmosphere.  I cannot get over waiting at your table for greater than 15 minutes for service, so usually have to saunter up the bar, order a beer, pay and peramble back to the table before the server even acknowledges our existence.  I wouldn't usually complain about this, but it has happened on more than one occasion.   Will always come here for the great beer selection, and you should too.  Best in downtown Phoenix, bar none.

"Meh, I've experienced better" perfectly describes this place.  In fact, I ditched my plug in grilled cheese maker years ago, maybe they are coming back into fashion, I don't know. Either way, all the sandwiches here are pressed and grilled in a circular fashion.  Not many options for a herbivore either, I think one sandwich, and maybe a sweet nutella version.  Again, totally underwhelming experience.  Won't be coming back....well, ever.  Make the trip a few blocks south to Pane Bianco, you won't regret it.

This place is dynamo for lunch or dinner and is really as good as it gets.  This restaurant group is amazeballs to begin with (Postino Wine Cafe, Windsor, Churn and a taco joint in the works) and Federal Pizza is another bright star shining in their sky.  The prices are reasonable for this wave of artisan pizza that we are all drowning in, but in my mind so, so worth every penny.  Perfectly thin and crispy crust with delicately distributed toppings and gooey, melty cheese battle for control of your tastebuds in a war where everyone wins. We've tried the sweet potato pizza and brussel sprout pizza and both were unique and taste-tastic.   The service is always top notch and I definitely recommend the fried polenta as an appetizer. Get over the hipster crowd and maybe-too-loud music and enjoy the damn good food.

I love this place, and although sad that they moved further away from my house, I am really happy for these guys in their amazingly large by comparison new restaurant with the separate take out door...such a great improvement over the 12th street mob scene.  We usually order pick up here and although the pizzas are a little pricey, they NEVER disappoint.  I am fan of the plain ol cheese pizza and these guys knock it out of the park.  I crave Spinato's cheese pizza and I love the Chicago square cut slices.    Always order these guys pie during a special occasion and I must say that I am hooked for life!  Keep up the great work guys!
