I've lived at Miramonte for the past year, and I have to say since the first day I walked into the office its been a fantastic experience. The property manager Meghan is absolutely amazing and her staff is equally as amazing. The property is very well maintained, lots of green grass and trees. The property also has plenty of guest parking, which is rare for most properties. The pool area is very nice and upscale, nice furniture and cabanas. The BBQ's around the property are really nice and easy to use. My apartment was one of the first to be upgraded with wood floors and new appliances, who wouldn't like that. My apartment was also situated in a really nice quite courtyard full of large trees and grass, my place never had a lot of direct sunlight which helped out with the electric bill in the summer.   Honestly I cant say enough good things about my experience at Miramonte, If you're looking for a very nice quite apartment complex this is the place.

Manager TJ has the worst customer service skills I've ever seen before. This is a good location and has lots of great workers. I won't return simply because of the experience I had with TJ.

Thanks for the message Ryan. I had a conversation with TJ and the other manager on duty. TJ didn't seem to care about my feedback and made it very clear in front of the other manger. I've been going to that location for well over 5 years and have had a fast pass on all of my cars in that time. I have no problem taking my business to your cave creek locations where my business is appreciated. Unfortunately you'll never see me refer anything to your Scottsdale location solely based on the lack of professionalism from TJ.

Been coming here for a long time, they've always done a fantastic job on my cars keeping them spotless. Jacob never lets me leave without making sure my car is spotless and perfect, couldn't ask for more that's for sure.

When I walked in I thought I was in 1950's LA, very old school retro. The property is well kept and the rooms where huge. Pool was very clean and the courtyard was a great hang out.   The best part was the staff was very helpful and accommodating, there wasn't much they didn't have or couldn't do.   Definitely a must stay again, best kept secret in Scottsdale.

I've had an account at wells for almost 20 years, all in good standing for both business and personal. Today I visited this branch out of convenience for a money order, I've gotten plenty from wells over the years and as resent as last month. I've never ever been charged for one, EVER. Today the manager Larry thought it was appropriate to charge me $10 for one, yes $10 for me to withdraw cash from my account in the form of a check, a transaction that was actually faster than if the teller had to count the money. I explained that I've never paid for one before in my life, but Larry was adamant about me forking out my $10, so I did because I didn't have the time to go to my normal branch.   I wouldn't recommend this beach simply because they only value profiting and not the satisfaction of their long term customers. Larry was truly a used car salesman with absolutely ZERO business ethics and morals.

By far the worst experience in my entire life. First off the girl working the pharmacy didn't have a clue as to what an insulin needle was, then her boss "Nicole" yelled at me after I asked her how could she not know what an insulin needle is, after all she only works in the pharmacy.   It only gets worse from here, then her boss "Nicole" told me she refuses to sell me my prescription because I was being rude. At this point her boss "Nicole", who I might at is the pharmacist at this location started discussing my medications out load in front of numerous customers, this is actually a HIPPA violation just in case nobody knows.   Wait, it gets better. I finally convinced her that she can't withhold my prescription and I completed my transaction. I made my way to the front of the store and requested the manager, while I was discussing the situation with the manager the pharmacist "Nicole" stormed up to the front of the store and continued to badger and yell at me in front of the store manager who was trying to listen to what I was saying. Keep in mind all this happened in front of a half dozen or more customers at the front of the store.   At this point I'm completely shocked at the level of unprofessionalism and total disregard for patient privacy regarding the HIPPA laws and regulations by the pharmacist "Nicole" at this location. Not only did she verbally attack me at the back of the store she purposely stormed to the front of the store and display even more levels of unprofessionalism. At a minimum this pharmacist "Nicole" should be fired and not be placed in a customer facing roll. Not only does she lack anger management skills she clearly doesn't coach her employees on how to properly help the customers and their needs.

Probably the worst service I have every seen, they charge their customers incorrectly them never fix it, after calling the doctors office four times and speaking to the doctors mommy who does his book keeping she never fixed anything. I had to babysit the process for them to finally pull the bill out of collections.  Apparently this Doctor is in desperate need of cash otherwise they would fix their errors and not waste people time.

I don't know where to start, I honestly feel all their reviews are fake. Let's start with the service, the wait staff did smile once as if they're miserable and unhappy to be there.   Their dinning area is very cramped, which makes extremely loud and hard to even hold a conversation. The food, the eggs seems processed and similar to Denny's. The pancakes also lacked authenticity and tasted very processed. The bananas on the pancakes and their bacon is all that tasted freshly made.   Along with the unhappy wait staff, the proceeded food, they have an unusual fly issue in their indoor dinning area. I literally couldn't go 20 seconds without swatting them away, I even killed one at my table leaving it as a souvenir for the bus staff.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this breakfast spot to anyone looking for authentic home style cooking experience.

I was referred to Mastermind from a friend that used them recently, probably the best referral I've ever had. From the beginning of the process they communicated the costs and up until my move day the communication was excellent. They were on time and came ready to work, even on a hot June day they were happy and didn't complain about anything. When it came time to pay the bill there were no hidden costs or surprises, clear cut and simple.   If you're moving and want movers that are reliable, trustworthy, polite, professional and care about your property then this is your absolute best choice.

One star is a stretch for this brand new location. Came in on a Saturday night to train, by far the most discussing weight floor I've ever seen. At least 12 old used dirty towels laying around and draped on equipment. On top of that empty water bottles on the floor. If it wasn't for me telling the sales staff the lazy kids working the counter would have never got off their ass and worked.
