Went to RA Sushi today for lunch. The place was empty but clean and the service was good that's why this review has two stars... As for the sushi rolls I've had better tasting sushi from my grocery store.  We ordered two california rolls, Rainbow Roll, a salmon and lobster roll and a supreme tempura roll (may be called something different). No matter what they are called when you order sushi from a place like this at the prices you are paying at this place you expect them to be rolled fresh when you order them. All of the rolls were previously rolled and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland. The Wasabi was very bland and was not spicy at all and almost brown in color. For almost $100 including tax and tip I'd rather eat somewhere else. Will I return? No

The food here is simply fantastic. You must come here and try it. The atmosphere is very European small and intimate. Large patio for dining al fresco and the staff is very caring of your needs. Comfortable and affordable. You will not leave here hungry.

The atmosphere is relaxed, food is good for bar food and the prices are great. The staff is friendly and attentive.   Bring the family to watch the game and hang out.

They have it down. This place has good food and service. The review that tried it for first time on a Friday night at 7PM needs to try it again. This place gets very busy for their fish fry. And they ask for ID's because they turn in to a 21 and over establishment at 9pm for the live music on Fridays and Saturdays (Posted on their door before you walk in). The two pieces of fish they got on their fist order was probably because the kitchen was slammed with orders at that hour and wanted them to have their meals and not wait for them.

Sorry to say they closed on July 13, 2014 per the posting on the door. They will be missed. The West Valley needs more places like this. Enough with the commercial giants and the fried bar food establishments. We are very sad to see them close.

Nice place and big improvement over the Native New Yorker that used to be here. Very clean and friendly prompt service. This would have been a five star but one thing; they used to have home made French fries that were the best in the West Valley. They now have the coated garbage every other crap dive in the valley has. The  rest of the menu is great. Please bring back the fries I would be willing to pay more.

Upon entering 4 host/hostesses greated us with sour faces. One took us to a seat on the patio. Sat at the table for fifteen minutes and no one ever came over to the table. There were only a few people in the place so being busy was no excuse. After looking at the menu and the high prices ($8.95 for hummus... Really?) We got up and left with the same four standing at the entrance not doing a thing. Good luck getting this place off the ground with this kind of service.
