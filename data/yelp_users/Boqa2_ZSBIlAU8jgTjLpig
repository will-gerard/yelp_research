First off,it is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there... which is annoying. My daughter is a new patient with them and the first time I called to schedule a appointment the lady was rude and always interrupted when I spoke,there was a day where I couldn't make it in and I called to see if I could schedule a later appt,and the receptionist said abruptly that I couldn't because the doctor was leaving and there are no open spots today and I needed to take my daughter in right at that very moment... another day I came in the doctor we asked to be my daughters doctor and I even know what she looks like wasn't even our doctor,she didn't even tell us her name,she didn't even physically check on my daughter and I had to do all the work,not to mention this day I came in to check up on my daughter's burn marks... She didn't say much and didn't really do anything.. I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here.. as of now I just called to schedule another appt,also not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back again,so as of now I called in to schedule another check up.... they open at 8? Yeah I'm pretty sure!  Ring Ring no answer,call again..ring ring no answer.. called 4 times and no answer. No they were not busy it rang for a long time, I'm not site if they're busy or ignoring calls. But I'm giving them one more chance and if it it blows bye bye arrowhead pediatrics.

Tried this place out with my boyfriend and daughter,I ordered the gyros place and my boyfriend ordered the shawarma plate. We arrived an hour before they closed and it took 30mins for our order to come out. Mind you that they close pretty early at 8. So we only had another 30 to eat before they closed. So It was kind of a bummer that our order took so long. When we finally got our food it's pretty much a bang for your buck they give you a pretty good amount of meat and the side of your choice plus two salads and 2 warm pita breads. It was tasty and my tummy was def happy. Defiantly daughter approved for my little one. I also ordered spanakopita.(layered philo dough with a filling of spinach and ricotta cheese or feta maybe..) it was only $1 I was expecting it to be a decent size but nothing too big. What I got was literally a bite size triangle piece of spanakopita. I wish they had made them bigger because I've always wanted to try them thanks to food network and they were so tasty,just not a fan of how bite sized they are. I like the place and where it's located. I docked down a star because it took a long time for our food and the little bite size pie. Other than that I would definitely go back.

Amazing place mac n cheese,pudding burger and coffees are to die for. Good vibes and very relaxed place. Even though it's hidden and a bit hard to get to it's well worth it. For sure will be coming back again.

Love how they made the place with later hours.. the bulgogi and kimchi tofu soup is very tasty and packed with flavor... The atmosphere of the resto is very clean and chill. I'll for sure be going back. Very good Korean restaurant!!!

I absolutely love this place. Pho,rice dishes and everything is very good and def gives you a happy tummy. I always come to this as it isnt too far away from where I live. I love how they started adding boba,Snoh and macarons to their menu they're also very tasty. They sell macarons only on Saturdays for 1.50 some time 2.00... They're a bit tiny but they are always a guilty pleasure.. the Snoh and boba are top notch as always not bad on the prices neither. The environment is very friendly and welcoming. Im obsessed with their brisket pho and crispy eggrolls. This place isn't too hard to find and is a good place to come and grab a bite to eat. The waiters are very friendly and always have a smile on their face.

Love chilis,I think it's better than applebees. But this was the first time I've been to this location I see the food they have improved on and I love the new menu items but.... I was not pleased at all with service maybe our waiter was tired or overwhelmed,but I don't see anything to be overwhelmed about.. he only had us (my fam,just my boyfriend and daughter) and another couple that was sitting behind us. He was only serving two parties...  Later one more people came and that's when it got even worse. We waited 15mins to get our drinks refilled and I noticed that he was paying more attention to the other people dining in the area than he was with us maybe he was racial profiling? As we are Asian and everyone else is white. But oh well, just serve your diners right! It took us another 20mins to finally get our check then my bf decided to just let us wait in the car... For another 20mins which felt like forever I thought my bf was in the bathroom lol. But goes to find out that he waited a long period of time just for a check and to go boxes because it wasn't worth waiting to eat the rest of our food when we weren't getting the right amount of attention our waiter shouldve been giving us.. he didn't even apologize or say anything...  Just do your job right even when you're tired or just whatever is wrong with you and you wouldn't have been given a 50CENT tip. (Better than nothing)

I really appreciate this place. That atmosphere is calm and casual. It's no typical Asian dine in place. They have a mix of Chinese,Vietnamese and all other varieties of Asian cuisine. It's not fancy but i you're looking for a Asian place that's not Panda Express then go here. The prices are reasonable and the food is yummy. The ca gio (viet crispy egg rolls) is my fave along with Padthai and pho!! Every time I visit my parents I always stop by here to eat. The workers and owners here are very sweet,friendly and polite. I hope they plan on doing a second wok in in the west valley,because this place isn't a disappointment.

First time coming here and hoping it would be a good place, and that did not turn out to be the case. It was dead,no customers very quiet and the people working there were a bit standoffish... The sushi did not look fresh as I picked the California roll and the avocado was grey not green at all. The sushi overall wasn't taste full.. I also ordered beef teriyaki and it wasn't good either in my opinion. It has some sort of burnt wood and gas flavor to it. We ordered sushi from the specials and I said to my boyfriend that it was very cold as I ordered a cooked sushi. Im sure the sushi chef heard and walked up to us and asked if everything was good.before I could say anything my bf lied and said it was good wanting to not hurt his feelings.... But overall I will not be going to this place ever!!

I tried this place again.. and just as I thought. It still hasn't updated it's taste in food at all. It was like I was there the first time all over again. I'm sorry to say but it's unenjoyable and gave me a tummy ache. Ordered the volcano roll I think and it was torched. It had a nasty gas burned flavor that wasnt good. I don't appreciate that. And I could see stack and stacks of already cooked tempura in the kitchen in the side. It's cooked but not cooked fresh when you ordered. It's a waste of money even though its cheap. Won't be going here ever ever again!!

House special drink is so yummy and addicting. I'll for sure be coming back for more. Only down fall is that it literally took 20mins to get my drink. If I didnt wait that long then I would def give them 5stars..
