Postino is a local favorite, and for good reason! Their food is always top-notch and the atmosphere is casual and fun. If you come in for the bruschetta board and wine night, prepare to wait, but know that it will be worth it! (It's a great deal, and everyone that's tried it comes back for more..) Brunch there is my favorite, and on a Saturday, it's not too crowded. $5 glasses of wine, pitchers of beer, mimosas and bellinis make it a reasonable meal, and the food is incredible! If it's your first visit, absolutely try the bruschetta (it's a LOT of food to order 4). My fave is a tie between the prosciutto + fig and the bacon + tomato. They're so delicious, you can't go wrong!! The paninis are well-made, hot and (like everything at Postino...) fresh! I love the turkey one with a small salad instead of chips.  If the food doesn't make you smile, the polite and prompt service will! We already can't wait to go back and dine with them again soon.

After hearing about the dazzling views, wonderful food and intimate atmosphere, I'd be saving my first trip to DPOV for a special occasion. When two of our closest friends announced that they'd be moving to California, we decided that the perfect occasion had arisen!  The location feels secluded and tucked away, but rest assured - the rumors about those views are true! Even on a cloudy night, it was beautiful. We walked the gorgeous, landscaped grounds a bit and continued up the stairs to the restaurant, where we were seated at an indoor table overlooking the city. Immediately, we decided that a bottle of wine would be the perfect call to kick off our farewell, and shared a lovely pinot noir. (Anticipating their raved-about steaks, of course.) We kicked off the evening with some fresh oysters that were fantastic! Each of us ordered a steak, and I asked for mine to be medium-rare. Unfortunately, my steak was pretty overdone, and while I indicated this cutting into it, I said I'd go ahead and accept it, as I hate to send food back unless it's inedible. The waiters were kind enough to make this up to me with a free dessert that was delicious! The waiters, too, deserve a shout-out for being absolutely wonderful and keeping our glasses (and bellies) full!  After dessert, we strolled around the patio, and went down a level to check out the beautiful fire feature. I'd definitely recommend this place for a special occasion... it was a lovely way to wish our friends well before their move!

While it's only a few blocks from our place (score!), we hadn't had the chance to take in a game here until this weekend. The stadium is very pretty with some mature trees in front of the entrance and in the "lawn" area. We sat along the third base line and were able to score some super cheap tickets on stub hub right before the game started ($20/ea)! If you're counting on scalping tickets, be aware that we didn't see anyone selling before the spring training game.  As far as the actual stadium, it's small, and there's not a bad seat in the place! I HIGHLY recommend that if you're a man or woman in short shorts or a skirt, you bring something to shield your legs from the 120-degree dark green seats... Not pleasant!!  Beers are the usual $8-10, and there's a variety of bottled and draft beer available. There are also numerous food vendors, including a noodle place, chicken, hot dogs, salty Seniorita and dos gringos. Pretty great for a baseball stadium! Definitely bring cash, though it goes without saying, for the seat vendors. It gets hot, and you'll drink beers (or lemonade or water) like water... You don't want to get up every 30-45mins for something else to drink! Also, pack some sunscreen - especially if you're out on the lawn!!

I've had pretty mixed experiences at Dos Gringos... on the one hand, their drinks are always stiff and cheap, which is a big win in my book. On the other, the place is always empty, and if you're ordering food, the service in the kitchen is severely lacking. The place is so big that without a lot of patrons, it feels like you need to bring a group to have any fun. If you're just one or two people looking to hang out with new folks, you're going to find yourself sitting alone at the bar.  When you can get food, it's actually pretty good. The pork chile nachos are my favorite, so you can imagine how sad I was staring at them, from my table, sitting in the kitchen window for 10 minutes before they were finally brought to my table last night! When it comes to Mexican food, there are a lot of great places in Phoenix, and honestly, I just don't see waiting that long to be served in a place with very few customers when there are so many other options... (For the record, I also watched other food sit in the window for similar amounts of time. I have been a waitress before, and I understand it being hard to run food when the place is slammed, but it was pretty empty, and there were idle servers.)  Bottom line: If you're going with a big group for drinks, it's a good place. If you're going for food or with just a few people, don't expect it to be packed, fast or much of a party.

I've been to Giligan's many times - and admittedly, some times are better than others. That said, they were my favorite place in the world Saturday night (before the Super Bowl).  While every bar in Old Town had a 30 person line and was charging at least a $50 cover (for guys, $20 for girls), Giligans was throwing down with a no-cover block party, and a crowd that was, well... WAY less douchey than what we saw a few blocks away.  Don't get me wrong, when I'm in the mood to rage, Old Town is great on a regular weekend... it was just a complete hell-hole the weekend of the big game. (I know, I should have expected that that would be the case!) Since I'd left my 8 inch heels and miniskirt at home, we bailed on that ridiculous socialite scene to go to this awesome dive!  There was live music, a great crowd, lots of dancing, and (amazingly) DECENT SERVICE!!! We could actually GET a beer! (Something that would've been impossible a up the street, since I'm not handing out hundies to the lingerie'd moon balloons behind the bar.)  Our group had an awesome time hanging out inside, enjoying a few beers, and dancing our way through the crowd! It might be dead some weekends, but when you can get a good crowd in this place (particularly for their block parties), it's a blast. I will always have a short, special place in my heart for them after this weekend - they made a frustrating night into a great one! Rock on, Giligan's!

I don't even know where to start with this review except to say that this is, hands down, the worst restaurant experience I have had since I moved to Scottsdale a year and a half ago.  A friend planned a post-work happy hour here with a large group of friends (7 total), with most of us arriving around 5:30PM. Before being seated, as we arrived a little early, my boyfriend and I found seats after the bar. After a short wait, the bartender came over and served us each a Corona, which was the only reason this place got a star at all.  Once our friends arrived, we were seated in a large booth with an adjoining table. Our waitress was kind, but ineffective at her job. Repeatedly, she walked away from our table mid-sentence or once we'd asked to order. Being new to Los Olivos, I decided to stick with a relatively safe entree: nachos with chicken. She asked me if I'd like to add guac and sour cream and when I said "sure", she informed me that each item was a THREE DOLLAR upcharge, and that the basic nachos (cheese, jalapenos) with chicken were $14.95, meaning the resultant nachos with guac were going to be almost $18!! When I saw a menu and realized that only cheese and jalapenos were on the nachos, I called her back over and asked to cancel the order altogether so that I could get something else. She said that they were already done and she would charge me $15.95 with the guac because "some of the prices in the computer are wrong". Okay, I ordered them, they're nachos, how bad can they be, right?  Wrong. Ten minutes after she told me that they were done, they came out with the rest of the food. The base chips were greasy and covered with what appeared to be dried up shredded cheese, melted 10-15 minutes ago. You couldn't even get a chip without it breaking off from the baked-on cheese. The chicken was dry, and had no moisture. Yes, the portion was large, but that doesn't matter when the food is inedible. I -never- send food back or refuse to eat it (seriously, I could probably count on one hand the number of times that's ever happened to me in my life) and I -LOVE- nachos... but these were terrible. The entire rest of the table shook their heads in apology, and even when I offered them up, no one else wanted any.  At the end of our meal, I approached the ticket counter to pay and told the young girl there "Look... I ordered these, so I'll pay for them. But you need to know... those chicken nachos...", then she finished my sentence "Were terrible? Yeah, I know... They're bad! You should try something else next time!" I said "I'm just going to be honest, there's not going to be a next time here. This was really, really bad." She took my card and ran it (for $20, with the automatic gratuity) and told me to have a nice day. No apology, no offer to let me speak to the manager to at least make them aware of the food quality... just an acceptance that she KNEW they were awful and then swiping my card.  So, that's it for Los Olivos. They're my first one star review, and I have to tip my hat to them because they really earned it. The rest of our table all had reasonable experiences, but this was enough to turn me off of them for good. (Except their tiny $20 margarita pitchers... which the entire table thought was a rip off. $27, if you want strawberry.) Save yourself the trouble, go to Dos Gringos, Loco Patron, or any of the much better places with decent service to boot. At least they take decent care of their customers and will care about the experience.

Kazimierz is the perfect spot for a chill, fun night out in a more adult atmosphere. It's laid-back, retro speakeasy-style interior is often accompanied by talented bands and great jazz singers. They're constantly switching up their drink menus to include playful options like the "Dirty Disney" drink list and the "Dr. Seuss" drink options. The place feels intimate, classy and fun. Enter through the back door (facing the parking lot behind The Montauk) and don't protest the $5 cover. It goes straight to the band, and when you hear them, you'll know they're worth it. I've never tried their light bites, but this is a great place to kick off an evening with the girls (or a romantic date)!

Places like this make me really happy for promotions like Arizona Restaurant Week! I never would have stumbled into this place, if we hadn't seen it on the listing, and our entire group of four loved it! The ambiance was great (a little less casual than I'd realized... oops!) and the food was very good! I had the swordfish, and loved the flavor in their lemon-butter preparation. The server was very helpful with wine, and we found a bottle that worked for everyone at the table. I very much look forward to coming back and trying the exotic mushroom pan fry... someone near us had it, and it looked unbelievable.

The Coach House is a great little dive bar that's best experienced at Christmas time! It's always chill, and people are generally friendly and more casual than the bulk of Old Town. Drinks are cheap and quick with beers usually running between about $3-$5. Mixed drinks are stiff and similarly cheap! They usually don't offer food, but on the weekends, sometimes have BBQ available for $5. (If there's a big event going on, they sometimes even offer it for free! ...Usually on Sundays, from my experience.)  At Christmas time, this place is the bomb. They put tens of thousands of lights on this TINY place and it looks amazing! I was headed back home for the holidays this year and decided not to decorate my apartment... I'm not kidding when I say that this place was my Christmas away from Christmas! I loved it!!! (Lines can be pretty crazy at the holidays, especially on the weekends, so come early if that's when you're planning to check it out.)  All in all, Coach House is a great dive bar, and definitely a go-to for Old Town'ers who are not feeling the club scene. If you're looking to take a dive bar tour, I suggest starting here and then making the rounds to Patties and Giligans. Definitely makes for an entertaining night!

A few weeks ago, I noticed the check engine light on in my car. After a $100 diagnostic test at the dealership, I was quoted over $1200 (on a 2009 Hyundai Elantra) to have both O2 censors replaced and the spark plugs done. Knowing that that was an outrageous price, I decided to call around and see what I could find.  The folks over at Pep Boys were immediately able and willing to help with my problem. The gentleman that gave me my quote (Brandon) stayed after his store closed just to speak to me on the phone, letting me know the breakdown of the costs/product options/service time estimate. After discerning that Pep Boys was by far the most affordable option, I took my car in to have these few things done. Since I will be going back to school this fall, they allowed me to present my acceptance letter for their student discount, which meant that I was able to have the work my car needed done for under HALF of what the dealership wanted to charge me!   The best part is that with Pep Boys, I know I'm not compromising on quality. I know that even after I move, I'll be able to find a branch in my new state that I can depend on for car-care and maintenance. It's been about a month since I've had the work done on my car, and I've had absolutely no problems since they serviced it. Thanks, Pep Boys for treating me with respect, honesty and kindness when I needed your help. I'll be back!

Defalco's is a neighborhood favorite and the only place in Phoenix that my picky Philadelphian boyfriend will order a cheesesteak! The place is small and kind of cluttered, but there's no denying its charm or quality! Half grocer, half deli, Defalco's is legitimate Italian cuisine, and I constantly meet people who've lived in Italy (or that are from traditional italian families) picking up groceries there. (The biscotti are wonderful!)  When going in for lunch, I highly recommend calling ahead, as there's typically a long wait to get food on your lunch hour. The hot sandwiches are great (chicken pesto being my favorite!), and the salads are decent. I had the chicken pesto salad last time, which was a little heavy on the dressing, but still good.  All in all, if recommend if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive lunch with fewer than 5 people. Beyond that, seating is difficult. Call in your order to expedite the wait time!

My first Four Peaks experience was over lunch with a group of friends... and immediately I knew I had to organize a happy hour here for my coworkers! This place is big, has a great ambiance, awesome beer, and the food is fantastic! We brought in a big group of 15, and while it was a little frustrating that we couldn't be seated until the majority of our party was there (no reservations either), they had plenty of space to accommodate us, and our server stayed on top of having such a large table. Everyone found something they liked on the menu, though we were a little disappointed that there weren't any food-specials offered at happy hour. Still, there's plenty to try (liquid or solid), and I found myself a big fan of the fish and chips! Perfect beer-battered coating means they're not too heavy, and with a salad in lieu of chips, it was just right for me! I only wish they had a location in Old Town, so that I didn't have to worry about driving home!!!

I'll begin with a disclaimer: I'm not a big diamondback's fan. (I know, boo me!) But with that said, a night out to Chase Field is almost certainly going to be a great one!   I've been to three or four games here, and as a venue, this location has a lot to offer. The retractable roof allows for a controlled, air-conditioned atmosphere when it's needed on the hottest days, and a lovely, open-air feel when the temperatures outside aren't scorching. The outfield even features a pool that you can rent out with a big group! (I believe this has to be done well in advance to actually make it happen.)   As for dining options, the field has everything from pizza to froyo to actual sit-down meal service with a view of the diamond. Vendors walk the stands selling lemonade, peanuts, beer, and other great ballpark goodies. It's also the only place you can get a 3ft corndog on a bed of fries! (And I hear that the subsequent heart attack is completely complimentary! What a deal!!!) Ok, I'll confess. I've actually tried it, and if you're splitting it with 3+ people, it's doable, but prepare for a food baby like no other.  So, even if you're not a diamondbacks fan, the games are a great time! Around the stadium you'll find a lot of fun things to do, and as it's just off of the light rail, parking doesn't have to be a hassle. Bring a glove, grab a beer, and 'Merica-out at the ballpark. It's what our founding fathers would have wanted.

A few months ago, we stumbled across this a great little Italian place, tucked away unassumingly in a strip mall. Having been there three or four times now, this is one of our favorite go-to's for a classic Italian meal! The wait, even on a Saturday night, has never been more than about 15 minutes, and the staff are knowledgeable and quick.  On our last visit, we started with a wonderful appetizer of seared scallops and greens. They were a little on the small side, but delicious! They were cooked perfectly (so tender!) and the sauce that came with them added a great flavor. They also bring focaccia and white bread to your table, paired with a garlic'y butter that isn't overwhelming. For my main meal, I had an awesome orecchiette pasta in red sauce with sausage, and I ate every bite! It had just the right amount of spice, and was cooked in a delicious, creamy marinara. I think that my all-time favorite here is still the seafood pasta, but I was feeling adventurous, and enjoyed trying something new! We shared a good bottle of red wine, and were glad to take it home when we couldn't finish it. (Tip: If you like their wines, the restaurant sells the bottles outside of actually dining with them... then again, I don't know how you could come here and not enjoy the food!)  The place is charming and has a cozy, old-world vibe that makes the already genuine food and service feel even more so. The staff welcomes you warmly, and you'll leave with a full and happy tummy, as one should from a great Italian place!

This place is one of my favorites for a quick, fresh Mediterranean lunch! Their food is fantastic, and the service is always so fast and kind. My standby is the schawarma salad, but today I tried the chicken kabobs, and it's definitely my new go-to! The portions are so generous, you're certain to have leftovers (or at least not to leave hungry)! I always eye the baklava behind the counter, but the day still hasn't come when I've had enough of an appetite to enjoy both the meal and dessert. The chicken is always juicy and flavorful, and in the kabob's case, comes with a great garlic sauce (a little goes a long way!) to dip it in. The hummus and pita that come with it are one of my favorite parts of the meal! This place reminds me of a halal Mediterranean'ized Defalco's, if you've ever been there. It's half grocer, half restaurant with an all-too-tempting dessert counter. If you're looking for authentic, fresh Middle Eastern food stop in here... it's the best!!

I really wanted to like Su Vino... and I had high enough expectations for the place that I even organized a girl's night with 6 or 7 friends at this place, having never been there before. Well, that was my mistake.  Su Vino did take our reservation and accommodate us as promised. I was a little confused when making the reservation, as the lady asked me what we'd be having. Since we were all new to the place, I told her I wasn't sure and wasn't comfortable with ordering for everyone. (I had no idea how hungry people would be, or if they would just want wine or what have you...) Anyway, when I got to the winery, our table was ready, and having arrived about 10-15 minutes early, I had a seat.  While I waited, they brought over extra chairs, but never offered me anything to drink (a glass of wine might've been nice... even water!). They seemed understaffed and busy, so I wasn't able to catch someone and place an order while I waited. At our reservation time, 2-3 ladies arrived and joined my at our table. (As with most social outings, you have people who arrive on time and those who are "fashionably late".) I hoped at this point that the waiter or waitress would approach us for drinks, but we weren't helped until ALL members of our party had arrived, which was 15-20 minutes later. I'd been sitting there for over 30 minutes without even so much as an offer to order wine or anything else. We finally got the attention of the waitress and ordered wine and appetizers.  The appetizers are the only reason I gave this place an extra star. The food quality was good, and the portions were generous. We chose to do wine flights (big mistake), and with a flight of 5 wines (all ordered at the start), we waited about 15 minutes between each sample. It takes less than 5min to finish what equates to about 4 sips of wine... and so we sat with glasses empty for the majority of our evening. As to the quality of the wines, they were okay. Nothing fantastic, but we're far from refined pallets and we were just fine with them.  Two of the ladies in my party decided to split a bottle of wine, and when the waitress brought an open bottle of the wrong wine, she pointed out that they'd ordered something else. The waitress, jokingly but very rudely, told her how much trouble she was and went back to get and open the correct bottle. She didn't know the other ladies well and was embarrassed by the whole thing, which just honestly wasn't appropriate.  By the time we left, we were pretty let down by the service at this place. It took FOREVER to get drinks, and we would have ordered far more (probably a few bottles), if the service had been quicker and kept our glasses full. If they'd even just brought out all of our samples at once, we'd have finished them in 20-30 minutes and spent the next hour ordering additional drinks.  Ultimately, Su Vino was a super disappointing experience. I was really hoping to introduce the ladies to a fun new wine bar that we could then frequent. We all left disappointed, a little offended, and swearing the place off. Management really needs to staff the place better... The servers that were there were stretched far too thin over several tables to offer effective service.

Eddie's is one of my favorite Happy Hour spots in Scottsdale! The trick is going after 7PM any weeknight and sitting in the bar. There are specials there on drinks and appetizers that aren't offered in the main dining area of the restaurant, and they're a great deal! The appetizers are amazing (my boyfriend and I usually order 3 of them and share with drinks), and I've had almost all of them at this point. I definitely recommend the horseradish shrimp, if you like a little bit of a kick, and the chicken lollipops are amazing too! The bartender is very attentive and friendly, and though we only go about once a month, always remembers us. (Ask him about the Flatbread of the day... always delicious!)  Eddie's is also great if you're looking for a nice holiday dinner. I took my boyfriend there for Passover (I'm not the best cook!), and we had a wonderful meal. They do this kind of thing for several holidays, so if you feel like a splurge, it's a good call! If you're in for a standard dinner, I highly recommend the whats-in-this-Steak. (No, I don't know what's in it... but I do know that it was delicious!!!)  The only reason to knock Eddie's down a star is the pricing, which isn't a problem if you come in for happy hour. The one time I came in with another couple for a standard meal, we did have a bottle wine, but managed to break the $400 mark on the bill, not counting tip. It's a great place, but I just don't see coming in and spending that when the happy hour is just as good! (Though it was a special occasion, and very delicious!)  TLDNR: Sit at the bar after 7PM on weekdays, great specials there not served in restaurant... and be nice to the bartender, he's a cool guy who will remember you.

I still cannot say enough about this place. It's one of the best restaurants in Old Town with by far the best happy hour. Tonight we had the pleasure of meeting Chef Eddie after our wonderful meal. He was so polite and kind! After a bit of conversation, he got all four of our names and promised to say hello next time we were in.  Beyond meeting the chef, the food was awesome (as usual). We took another couple there, since it's one of our favorite gems. The happy hour menu included a BLT pesto flatbread that was so fresh and flavorful! As usual, we opted to have the chicken lollipops, lamb and shrimp. The quality and taste is fantastic and consistent - we never have to wonder if Eddie's will live up to the high expectations we have for the place. It's so nice to see an owner who is invested in both his establishment and the community!  Sit in the bar, go after 7, and prepare to try 3-4 amazing dishes!

Let me start by saying that I am super hair-shy... before this experience, I had never colored my hair (even highlights) and changing the length much is usually a HUGE decision for me. I've never had a regular stylist because honestly, I've just never found one that I felt like really listened to me and what I wanted.  That ALL changed at Saints and Scissors. I scheduled an appointment with the owner, Paul, after seeing all of the great reviews he's had. -Best- hair decision I've ever made. Starting from the time I made my appointment, he was warm and accommodating, and he was incredibly helpful when I had to unexpectedly postpone my appointment due to illness. He willingly stayed late so that he could get me (a new client he didn't even know) in the following week.   Before he even touched my hair, Paul spent 20-30 minutes talking to me about what I wanted. He's the first stylist that made me really feel like he was listening to what I wanted, giving me advice where I needed it and walking me through the process. After some discussion, we decided on low-lights in a temporary color, very close to (but darker than) my natural one, blending it in so that my natural color would look like subtle highlights. He took such care and time in applying the color that my nerves faded away, and all that was left was excitement for seeing how it would turn out!  I'd been afraid that as damaged as my hair has become from the desert heat, I would have to cut it all off. I'd been trying to grow it out (as I told him), but I was open to cutting it up to the shoulders. Paul was able to work with my hair and only took off a few inches, so that with maintenance, I can continue to grow it back out and to keep it healthy. He also gave me some great pointers on how to keep my hair moisturized and from splitting, despite the natural heat, blow-drying and straightening I often put it through.  By the time he styled my hair, I was sitting in the chair with a big, goofy grin, excited about the new color and the excellent job he'd done! He was conversational, friendly, and most importantly, made me feel like he really cared about my hair and the end result. I would absolutely recommend, especially if you're thinking of trying something new, seeing Paul and letting him walk you through your new style. I will definitely be back to see him again, and am thrilled to have found a stylist that really values what he does! Definitely give him a shot - you won't be disappointed with the service or the result!!

While I'm not a frequent spa-goer, I was delighted to receive a wonderful getaway here for my birthday this year! The valet took my car on arriving and I was directed through the resort to a serene spa location. After checking in, I was led upstairs, where I was shown each of the facilities offered by Joya. The entire spa is decorated in a beautiful Moroccan style that I loved, complete with a cozy pillow-laden room for lounging and relaxing. I started there before being treated to a wonderful massage, where the therapist offered a few complimentary extras (oils/aromatherapy options) when she learned it was my birthday! (Very thoughtful of her!) She did an excellent job and after feeling completely relaxed and rejuvenated, I decided to take a little time next to the pool, which offered a phenomenal view of Camelback Mountain. (Seriously, gorgeous!!) Before my mani/pedi, I got to experience the other amenities, including the sauna, ice deluge and spa tubs. Such a treat! I found myself staying as late as possible to enjoy the experience. At the end of the day, I was able to shower and to use the complementary styling products to get ready for my birthday dinner. It almost couldn't have been a more perfect day!! Thanks, Joya!   (Side Note: It looked like they had a pretty great happy-hour deal on Mondays. I'd definitely recommend checking that out if you want a first-taste of the spa!)

After dining there for dinner a few months ago, I made a mental note to arrange a happy hour at 5th and Wine for some of my coworkers. Tonight, it finally happened!   If you work regular hours, you'll need to duck out a bit early to make Happy Hour, as it only runs from 3-6. We arrived around 5pm and were seated at a beautiful spot on their covered, but open air outdoor patio. It was a perfect 75 degrees, and soon, we were laughing over wine and picking happy hour specials to try!  The menu online is outdated (for happy hour at least). Bruschetta is no longer available at the happy hour price, but to our delight, meatballs, fried pickles and stuffed mushrooms were!! I was most excited for the meatballs and fried pickles. As a southerner, I'm pretty spoiled when it comes to fried foods, and the pickles weren't quite there for me... But the meatballs were so good, I finished them all before my partner showed up! (I guess that was okay since he had his own plate of them!)  I finished my first glass of wine ($5 at happy hour) and ordered one of "Yanni's Picks", which are $2 off with a yelp check in! The Pinot I selected was great, and I was thrilled to sip on it for the rest of the evening!  The service was a bit slow, though our pace was very casual, and our waitress was kind. My glass was never empty and she got all of our orders in in time for happy hour, even remembering to issue my yelp discount on the second glass of wine. We'll definitely be back! Great value and a lovely ambiance

For my birthday, I found myself struggling between a favorite standby-restaurant or somewhere new... I'm so glad I gave my boyfriend the go-ahead to surprise me with a new place because I was blown away by El Chorro!  We had a rather late meal with some of our best friends visiting us from out of town, making our reservations for around 8PM. When we arrived, the ambiance was already set with twinkling lights, roaring outdoor fires and a beautiful patio. It was brisk and I'd forgotten my coat, but upon being seated, I realized that heaters were keeping the patio quite warm. (Hooray!)  To start, we shared the sausage platter (which was AWESOME) and a shrimp pepper pot. They were each wonderful, and we finished them both! The sausages were my favorite, particularly with the great artisanal mustards they include. We caught up over a bottle of wine, ordered our meals and were surprised when we suddenly got a big basket of sticky buns! (We had no idea that the place was famous for these - we sort of thought someone else's dessert had been dropped off at our table!)  When we were sure they were ours, we dug in and they were phenomenal! A little strange to have between the appetizer and meal because they seem so dessert'y, but who am I to turn down sweet pastries? (Umm, bring it on!) We asked our waiter about the sticky buns, and he gave us the most interesting back story about the restaurant, the Marlboro man and some elephants that he trained using the sticky buns! I have no idea how much of it was true, but it was entertaining and made the restaurant's staple even more enjoyable!  For my main course, I had a seafood pasta that was out of this WORLD. Seriously, if you're a shellfish lover, this is the way to go. It was -awesome-. Our server was kind enough to even bring out a small birthday dessert, which we all shared (and still couldn't finish, as we were so full!) All in all, the food was 5-star, the ambiance 5-star, and the night couldn't have been better! It was the perfect evening with some great friends - thanks, El Chorro!

I tried Herb Box for lunch with a coworker today, and while it was a little pricey, I enjoyed the meal. The setting on the canal is beautiful, and on a perfect, 80-degree day like today, the outdoor setting was just right! Music was mellow, and if we hadn't had to come back to work, we could have killed hours drinking wine and hanging out.   I had the Sunflower Salad, which came with Cajun chicken, goat cheese, dried blueberries and strawberries, bacon and (of course) sunflower seeds! It was tossed with a light vinaigrette, and very tasty! My only complaint was that the chicken was in four large chunks, which I had a hard time cutting up because the bowls are a bit slanted, and it's hard to cut on greens. My coworker's was nicely cubed, though, so I'm guessing that's how it usually comes. Nothing that couldn't be solved with a small side plate!   The waiter was very kind, and with tip, I think the meal was about $20. (Pretty steep for a lunch salad in my opinion, and I only drank tap water.)  The verdict: Decent place for lunch, but maybe not very frequently... I'd probably be just as happy paying $15 at chop shop and getting a side of Sweet Potato Hash with that price!

Citizen is one of my favorite places to go for a nice meal with friends. We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here with a big group (12 people) at prime-time on a Friday. They were great about taking and honoring our large reservation, and we only waited about 15 minutes for our tables to be set up, which was pretty reasonable for the group size we had. The servers that helped us did a great job of keeping our glasses full, and were very attentive, despite how many of us there were. My boyfriend and I started with the deep sea crab cakes, which were amazing!! I'm also a huge fan of the chop salad, so I knew before we walked in the door what I'd be ordering! No one in our reservation had any problems with their food, and everyone seemed to really enjoy the dinner. I'm so glad I chose CPH for the occasion; the ambiance is great, the food superb, and the service wonderful as always! Thanks for a fun, celebratory evening!

Every year, I try to plan or throw a holiday party for my friends. I'm new to AZ and have seen the Tour De Tavern rolling around Old Town Scottsdale... Immediately I knew that we'd have to give it a try for this year's get-together! The gentleman who helped me arrange the tour, Brendan, was helpful and worked with us to provide a good deal for our group, since we would be renting out the full bike. Our driver worked with us to help us follow a pre-determined schedule (it is a pub crawl, after all!), so that we could get to all of the bars we were hoping to try. While alcohol isn't allowed on the bike, they did ensure that our thirst was quenched with drink specials at each of our stops! The bike is definitely more of a workout than you would guess, but after a few beers, no one minds, and our entire group agreed that it was worth it! I'd definitely recommend giving it a try - it's a fun, novel experience that everyone will love!

They must call it OSHO because it's OHSO delicious and chill. That's what I'm assuming here.  This location is right off of the canal, and a wonderful stop for anyone out riding a bike, walking a dog, or who loves a great patio. Behind the building, OHSO offers a back patio with a bike maintenance station, free dog treats for your furry friend, and a gorgeous view of Camelback Mountain. Their fun, laid-back vibe is perfect for an afternoon beer ($6 local pitchers at Happy Hour!) or a bike bar crawl with friends!  The service at OHSO has always been prompt and friendly in my experience, and the waiters are very kind about moving an umbrella over to your table if it's a particularly hot/sunny day. I've tried several of the entrees and apps at OHSO, and honestly, I've loved them all! (Special shout out to the Shrimp Ceviche and the Turkey Melt... so good!)   They have a program where you can come in and brew your own beer for $50, and then they give you $50 in gift certificates when you have a tapping party for your keg! How cool is that? Basically, it's no cost, except that you (and presumably all of your beer-drinking friends!) buy glasses of your beer at the end... of course, by then, you're spending the gift certificates they gave you! I hear that this books up months in advance, so it's the kind of thing you have to plan well ahead of time... but it sounds great!  Long story short, go to OHSO for the ambiance, the view and the great beers. Bring your dog along and enjoy a chill afternoon with friends!

I'm just going to be honest here - this is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.  I know, I know. It's not a divey Mexican place, and how can a slightly more-upscale, sit-down place be my FAVORITE with all of the mom and pop joints around? Plain and simple, it's awesome food in a fun atmosphere, and it just plain tastes the best. The table-side guacamole - Perfect. Adding pomegranate seeds? WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?!? Not to mention the house salsa, which is delicious, and the fresh-made chips! (Yummmmm....)  Seriously, so good! And the carne asada is the BOMB. If I know I'm going to Barrio Queen, I will literally fast all day for the opportunity to gorge myself on this dish - it's my favorite, and I still have a lot left to take home! The Barrio Pollo burrito is phenomenal too - it's like a chicken pot pie in a burrito. How can you say no to that?!  I often take friends and family from out of town to Barrio, and it's always a huge hit! I'd definitely recommend it for a nice, more intimate Mexican dining experience!  The only suggestion I have is that the service is sometimes hit or miss... I've had great servers here, and I've had some who didn't see us at the table for 15 minutes after we walked in the door. (This happened last night.) There are a few who could be a little more attentive, but on the whole, great place!

I will never have the tacos here again, and that's if I come back. Barrio was my favorite Mexican place until this afternoon. Apparently my taco Tuesday special came with a very solid case of food poisoning! I am so totally disappointed, and I don't think the memory of this will have me back over there any time soon... I had the carne asada, pollo y chorizo, chorizo and the fish one (pesca-something) and one or some combination of them had my stomach in pieces an hour later, and with my head in the trash can by 4pm. Ugh, Barrio, why??? We were so good together

I am a member at Teres, so I go once or twice a month. Compared to other places, their gels last a LOT longer, and don't peel as badly, in my experience. The technicians I have worked with do a great job, and are happy to either chat with you or let you relax, depending on your mood. I had a gel Mani/Pedi before New Year's, and really enjoyed the experience. The massages, oils and atmosphere are relaxing, and I feel like, with a membership, it's worth the price for a monthly splurge.  As far as opportunities to improve go, their booking system has been having problems since I began using Teres in October. Apparently, a lot of customers are in the system twice, which makes online booking difficult, and I realized that I missed my discount one month because it was not applied to my total (I popped up in the system as a non-member), so now I consistently remind them both before my appointment and at checkout to apply the correct price. Also, their chalkboard advertises specials that are no longer valid. I realize that it's likely painted on, but the technicians have voiced to me that those deals stopped "a long time ago". To me, that's no problem at all, but it's probably worthwhile to remove them from the board, as it may impact customers' choices.  All in all, a great nail place! I live about a mile away, so if you're in the old town area, it's super convenient and great quality! Just make sure that if you're a member, you're getting your member pricing! (That's what you're paying for, after all....)

We've been searching for a quality pizza place for a while, and this weekend, we found it in Il Bosco! The owner, Bill, waited our table himself and was so friendly, attentive and conversational. You can tell that he and the staff take a lot of pride in the quality of their food!   We elected to sit inside, which seemed to be the right choice, since the music next door was pretty loud and could have easily overwhelmed the outdoor seating area. The place was small, but quite cozy with a great view of the food preparation and pizza oven. Seriously, I watched that oven, and nothing sat in the window for more than a minute before it hit a table (impressive!!)   We started with some of the most tender, delicious meatballs I've had, sopping up the delicious marinara with our fresh, hot bread. Sooo good! We went for the Carmela pizza and both loved it!!! The ingredients were of very high, fresh quality, and it was piping hot! The wine was okay ($9 a glass is a little high for table wine in my opinion), but they kept our glasses full and we loved it! I hope to save some room for spumoni next time... Give this place a try! (They also offer take out if you're more interested in pick-up pizza!)

Brat Haus is a great little German joint with an awesome outdoor space and a plethora of delicious beer! We stopped in on a cool night, so we sat indoors, but if you're there in the summer time or when it's warm, definitely aim for the patio! There's often live entertainment, games and a very social atmosphere out there.  We tried the Rattlesnake chili (free with check in!) and one of the pretzels with beer cheese. The apps were great, and the chili has a smokey kick that as a southern, BBQ-loving girl, I totally appreciate! The spicy brat with peppers was HOT, as expected and hoped for, and made me even more grateful for the tall, cold beer I enjoyed with it!   This place is ideal for getting together with friends (lots of group seating outside), or for a quick bite before a movie or stroll through old town with your significant other. I can't wait to come back for the dog-friendly Sunday night special!

With just a month and a half left on my contract, it was hard to convince myself that repairing my iPhone 5 screen would be financially worthwhile, even though it looked terrible. Mike at Mobile iPhone Glass Repair was able to give me such a good deal on a screen replacement that I can now say it was -absolutely- worth the price. In just fifteen minutes, he was able to take my phone from shattered and broken to perfect again! He even came to my workplace, and was able to fix it at his car with all of the tools on-hand. He was polite, quick and did a great job! If you're looking for convenience and a good quality repair, I highly recommend giving him a try. I might actually be able to trade in my phone for a better deal when I renew/change my contract now!

I went to Chop Shop for a Friday lunch with a few friends who were ready to get out of the office. It was a beautiful day, and the indoor/outdoor seating was perfect, letting us get a little fresh air with our delicious meal!   When we walked in, the line was long (as it often is - but don't let that turn you off... it moves fairly quickly), and the seating was scarce. Having been before, I consider this a testament to the quality of the food, which is completely worth the wait! I always get the beet salad with chicken and the sweet potato hash, which are both great!! (As a born and raised Southerner, I can be hard to please when it comes to my sweet potatoes... With a little salt, these are on point!) My salad was fresh and absolutely fantastic. The quality of the raw greens in particular was outstanding. I'm not a huge salad dressing person, but on the beet salad, the vinaigrette is so light that it doesn't obscure the taste of the veggies, giving each bite a refreshing finish!  I wouldn't recommend a large group at Chop Shop just because the seating is so limited. It's designed, as far as I can tell, to be a quick service restaurant for small parties (you order at a counter and they bring it out to you), where you can get quality food for a reasonable price. Not a lot of big groups, and not a lot of people lingering when they finish... though it's perfect for a post-workout meal or a mid-day escape from the office!  Side note, they welcome pets outside! Another great bonus for Chop Shop! Also, a check in on yelp is good for a free coffee with the purchase of a breakfast item. :)

One of my faves! Their happy hour is always on-point, and their Shandies are so perfect in the summertime. We often go as a big group, sharing several of their appetizer options (veggies and hummus, chips and cheese, pretzel bites, etc.) and the pork belly nachos (LEGIT)! The place is huge and has very trendy/hipster vibe. They've generally got a lot of great beers on tap, so check out the draft list if you're into it. My only real complaint is how slow service can be sometimes. It's been pretty hit or miss for us, but if you can get someone that's on top of their game, it's a great experience!

If you're looking for a great patio, some baller nachos or just an exotic cut of meat, the Blind Pig is the way to go!! I've been here several times, twice to eat and probably 6-8 times to get fresh cuts of meat for home preparation. The guys (and girls!) behind the counter are incredibly helpful, and will go beyond just helping you pick great meats. Last time I picked up some awesome scallops, the gentleman that helped me also suggested some preparations and the correct amount of time required to cook them. (I'm an admitted novice...) They also do some great specials and have a loyalty program, if you check the business cards on the counter. (Bonus: Use the belly app to accrue even more rewards!)  As for dining in, I suggest sitting on the patio. During our last visit, the waitress was very attentive, and the ambiance was casual and fun. We split some fantastic nachos (seriously, my favorite in Scottsdale) and I had a great salad to help assuage my cheese-y guilt! The food was great, as always, and the only complaint we had was that we never saw the oysters we ordered. We were full enough from the nachos, and since we weren't charged for them, we let it go... but we were looking forward to giving them a shot!  All in all, it's a great place. Perfect for a casual dinner, catching up with friends! (Pick up some great meats to take home while you're there!)

Ok, as I said in my last review, I've had very different experiences at EVO. One of the interesting things about them is how frequently their menu changes... which can be good or bad, depending on your tastes. (The things you like are never there for long, but then, there are always new things to try.) This is definitely something they pride themselves on, and it gives them an opportunity to try new things.   On my last trip, I had trouble finding much that didn't feel overly trendy with far-reaching ingredients that just didn't sound appetizing. I tried again yesterday and found the new menu delightful, with a much better mix of standby favorites and adventurous meals. The new menu includes a great steak and a salmon that sounded delicious! Because they were doing a $2 pasta special (what a deal!!! Though understandably one night only) for their 2-yr anniversary, we decided to go with the EVO mainstay (which was fantastic!) and a few glasses of tap wine. (The tap pinot noir was actually really great! I don't know much about tap wines, but I was a fan.) The bruschetta we ordered to start was a pesto caprese that was wonderful - well dressed with great flavor and really set the meal off right. While we didn't try any of the new entrees, we will certainly try to get back before the menu rotates again, because they sounded fantastic!

I checked out Salut at the suggestion of a friend, inviting several coworkers along for happy hour. We came in at a time that wasn't overly busy and were very pleased, given the heat, to be seated inside. They had some wonderful specials, and the casual atmosphere was just what we were looking for. One of their specials, buy a bottle of wine, get another for $5, turned out to be perfect for the group of us to share! They also offered a variety of "bites", which serve about 2-4, for $2 off. We ordered 4-5 of them and shared them around... I loved them all, but was an especially big fan of the Mac N Cheese bites and hummus nachos. (Don't expect the servings to be large - they're like tapas.) The service was very helpful and kind, and we also enjoyed the music that came in around 6! We'll certainly be back for more happy hour adventures here, and I'm excited to check out the "1-penny refill mimosa brunch" they advertise on Sundays! Yum :)

Whiskey Row is a great night-time spot, if you're going out in Old Town and you don't mind paying $12-$14 for a small glass of moonshine. The tables have taps that are kind of unique - you can pour your own beers, and at the end of the night, they charge you for the volume of beer that's been poured.  Honestly, if I were rating this place on the night-time vibes alone, I'd probably give it three stars. The service is pretty awful, but the place is cool and the honky tonk vibe is unique, relative to the rest of Old Town. (Being from Tennessee myself, I appreciate having what feels like a little vegas'ed-up slice of Nashville out here in AZ.)  Now, the DAY time rating for this place ought to be a single star. The food is mediocre, the service is terrible and no one seems to really care that it's bad. I've been here for brunch twice. The badass bloody mary comes with an awesome slider (probably the best thing I've had there), but the drink itself was WAY too sweet. I have no idea what they're putting in it, but it was almost too much sweetness to drink. The omelette was unseasoned and cool, like it had been sitting. (The rest of our table was pretty disappointed with their food too. about 6 of us had bloody marys and only one person really enjoyed theirs.) The service is slow, inexperienced, and if I had to guess, the girls who spend the night dancing on the bar (no judgement here - it's just that they might be a little better at the bar-dancing than serving. I've been a server - I get that it can be tough... but the place wasn't slammed either time that I was there and the service was still awful).   On our second trip, we ordered some fried pickles as an app. The server that brought them out dropped half of them on the floor and 15 minutes later, brought us TWO individual spears of fried pickles to make up for it (less than what had been dropped). You only get like 8 in an order, and honestly, if you drop half of it, you ought to just bring another order or at LEAST what you dropped! We repeatedly had to flag people down for refills and ultimately, checks. For the price of brunch here, you'd be much better served to go over to RnR, Breakfast Club or Daily Dose. RnR is constantly packed, but at least their servers pay attention to their tables, and you get a decent amount of food. This will be an occasional evenings only place for me in the future.

During the football season, you can find me at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers most Saturdays... Why??? Because they're an Auburn bar. Am I an Auburn fan? Hell no. -BUT- it means that they are one of the few places in town that carries the SEC network, which means I can almost certainly watch my Tennessee Vols! (And drown my consequent sorrows in delicious craft beer..)  As for the actual restaurant...  I really enjoy CB&C Scottsdale for the casual, open-air ambiance and their great food. You've got to start out with the Tot-chos, which are going to be amazing. They're basically tater-tot nachos and they're twice as delicious as that idea sounds. (The half order is pretty big, but if you're going with a group of more than 4, get a full order!)  What's next? Well, you could honor the namesake and go with one of their classic burgers (which are fantastic!) or you could go out on a limb and build your own Mac N Cheese. (My preferred meal of choice!) You can add a huge array of veggies, meats and other toppings that make your mac out of this world! If you feel a little healthier, their hummus and veggie platter is great, and while I haven't tried them, their salads look pretty tasty.  So, check it out, splurge, and lessen your guilt with a stroll around Old Town afterwards. For the best ambiance, try to catch a game while you're there!

Let me start by saying: Yes, Castaways is a total hole-in-the-wall dive bar. It's small, it's not fancy, and it is -the bomb-.  I didn't know about Castaway's until my kickball team started using it as its league bar on Tuesday nights. The first time I ate there, I was super hesitant, not being a huge fan of bar food... but in all honesty, this is my FAVORITE place to grab a sandwich now! Seriously, I bet I've been to this place 20-30 times, and there is nothing better than the W sandwich. I've had the pizzas too, which are good... I saw someone else order some pretty amazing looking pasta once - but nothing can turn me away from that sandwich!!! It is SO good (and probably enough for two people!)  The drinks are cheap, and the food is good. Go with friends, and hope you're there on a night when they have more than one bartender. The guy that's usually there on Tuesdays does a great job of working his butt off to get to everyone, but the bottom line is that they need another bartender there on league nights. The time it takes to get a drink has become such a point of contention, they've actually considered changing bars over it...  All that said, if you can get in there when it's not slammed, bring some friends, grab a W-Sandwich, and raise your glasses! Cheers, friends!

I was both surprised and impressed with Alo when a coworker suggested we try lunch there yesterday. The place is small and discreet, and despite living two streets away, I wasn't even aware it existed until we spotted it walking to Cornish Pasty. The menu was rather limited, but the Sedona chicken sandwich was unbelievable! It looked like it should be pictured on a menu and tasted even better!!! They let me swap fruit in for chips, and it was the perfect lunch meal. The setting is great, with lots of plants and flowers surrounding their shady patio. The service was a little hands-off, but very kind and helpful. I can't wait to go back and try something new! I wish they offered a few salads, but seriously, I would be happy again any day with that sandwich! Fresh, delicious and an awesome discovery!

Cornish is a great place for a quick lunch or for a nice, casual dinner with friends in the evening. I've been several times, and the beer selection is always great. The servers are friendly and prompt, and the place has a casual, but slightly more upscale atmosphere. If it's a nice night, their deck is the perfect place to socialize and to try a new pasty! But wait - before you get to the pasty, you need to try those bacon-wrapped meatballs... they're amazing!!! Anyway - back to the pasty. I've tried 3 or 4 of them, and I've never found one I didn't like. The Mexican-style one is my current fave, but the pesto chicken one is great too. This is definitely a place to go hungry or to share - these things are big, and boy are they filling. If you've never had a pasty, it's sort of like a calzone, but with fillings that are more like a pot-pie or something similar. Very very good! The only thing to be aware of is that they prepare most of these before you order... so pick one that you don't have to change. (As in, they can't remove the onions from it for you or that kind of thing). But hey, if pasties aren't your game, their salads are great too! The Greek with chicken comes with an awesome green dressing... I have no idea what it is (some kind of vinaigrette?) but it's fantastic! I'd buy bottles of it if they sold it. All in all, a great place for a chill dinner and a cold beer - give it a shot!

As far as the food, it's a Jimmy johns. Always decent, always consistent, and before I started ordering from this location, always fast.  I can reliably depend on this location, which is barely a mile away, taking between 45-60 minutes to deliver my order. I've started just going to pick it up because the delivery folks always have some crazy story about why it took so long. (Last time, the person couldn't find the location before me and REEKED of cigarettes handing me my food.) I'd understand if this happened once, but it's literally EVERY time I order and "give their delivery folks another shot".  It kind of breaks my heart because I used to LOVE Jimmy John's in TN... They were always to my apartment in 15minutes and were roughly the same distance away. THOSE were subs so fast I freaked... These are subs so slow, you might as well give up.

If I'm going to go into Old Town, and I'm not in a divey mood (or I have a diverse crowd with me), Wasted Grain is my first choice! The place is distinctly divided into three separate sections.  Section 1 - Live music, front of the house. This area is where the bands perform, my favorite of which is called "Smashed". They do a lot of 80's-00's stuff, and everyone enjoys it! Drinks are pretty reasonable for Old Town, and if you're not an asshole to the staff, they'll get to you pretty quickly. There's some dancing, but plenty of tables to pop down at, should you prefer to sit and watch.  Section 2 - Outdoor patio. Downstairs, the outdoor patio is much like the front of the house. Live music permeates the area, but with less volume. You can step out here for a more casual experience, if you'd like to get out of the mix for a few. If you're looking for a conversation spot, the upstairs patio is ideal. When it's cool, there are heaters and it makes for a mellow middle ground between the live music and the 100 proof lounge. (Note: Loads of smokers up here.)  Section 3 - The 100 proof lounge. This area is upstairs, across the sitting area/patio from the live music venue, and it's a PARTY. The lounge is a lot like the other clubs in Scottsdale, complete with it's own bar, DJ and go go dancers. I've had mixed experiences up here, ranging from a fun time dancing to getting groped on my way to the bathroom. (NOT cool.) Generally, if I'm in this kind of mood, I've left WG and ventured further into Old Town, but it is cool to have everything in one place.  Overall, it's one of the better Old Town spots, purely because of the diversity it offers. When three girls want to do shots party their faces off, two want to get beers and see the band, and one wants to cry into her Cosmo to you on a quiet patio about how shitty her (insert ANYTHING here) is, you don't have to split up the party! There's a venue for everyone within the one place, and once you're all on the same level, you can venture further into Old Town.  Also, their gin and tonic with mint is great. Plus, Market Crash Mondays - it's a stock market for your drinks! My advice? Hedge your risk. Buy 3 of whatever you want! ;)

I've been hearing praise for Postino's since I moved to Phoenix a year ago... Finally, today, I was able to go check it out myself!  This wasn't the first time I've attempted to go to Postino's. If you get there late, there's too much of a wait to enjoy it for a workday lunch... but my two coworkers and I arrived around 11:30 today and had no problem getting a lovely table outside in the sunshine! Our service was friendly and quick, and our glasses were never empty. I've heard about the legendary bruschetta, but today, I opted for a turkey panini. (I hear that their happy hour is a pretty bomb deal on the bruschetta. It's regularly $14 for 4 pieces, but at happy hour, you can pay $20 for the same 4-pieces AND get a bottle of wine... so I imagine I'll be coming back to try it then!) That said, I was really happy with my selection! I should've had a salad with it, because once I saw the greens, they looked really good... but I went with the chips. They were a little greasier than I care for, but still very good! The sandwich was fantastic!!! I had mine on focaccia and it was delicious - melty, warm and the pesto really gave it a good finish!   The price was reasonable for a lunch out (around $13), and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day. I'll definitely be back here again soon! (Preferably for their happy hour... it looked like they had a great wine selection too!)

Disclaimer: I was here for drinks, not food... so I'm rating this place at first blush... that said, I'm looking forward to the opportunity to come back ASAP!  I know I've passed this place a handful of times, each one thinking "Wow, what is that place? It's hopping in there!!! I've gotta get back here and check it out!" Well, going out for a friend's birthday, I finally had a chance to pop in and see what it was about!  We started here for drinks, and I've gotta say, the ambiance is so cool and comfortable. The seating options range from cozy chairs to big lush booths that encourage an intimate feel, perfect for kicking off an evening or catching up with friends! I ordered the "Secret Garden", which was so good, I went back for another. The service was reasonable, though a little slow to check for refills. I'm told that they have a great happy hour, so I'll definitely make my way back over to see how that is. What a cool discovery, and just a few blocks from home! Perfect!

I went in yesterday to take advantage of a two-week guest pass that my boyfriend had gotten with his membership, which he's had for several months. I was ready to work out, and at the front desk, I was (kindly) directed to the sales staff. The woman I spoke to was incredulous that I thought I could work out for two weeks for free, despite my explanation that my boyfriend had registered me for the guest pass. She asked me for a paper pass, which I didn't have, and then asked me where he was. (In a personal training session, 10 feet away.) I told her he'd registered me for it online, and she shook her head and said "no, no... let me check with my manager", rather than looking to see if it was in their system. A minute or two later she came back and said "Yeah, I'm sorry. We can't just GIVE you two weeks. The best we can do is one, if you fill out this form." Since I'm about to be out of town for four days (which would be half of the trial period), I told her to forget it and left. When my boyfriend's training session ended, he asked them why I'd left (I didn't want to bother him during his workout to explain), and the woman told him I didn't want the two-week session he'd registered me for. WHAT? I don't know what the deal is over there, but I think I'll stick with running around my neighborhood. What a frustrating experience!!

Last week, I was trying to come up with a great new place to try for dinner with friends... The Southerner in me could not have been more thrilled to find the Angry Crab Shack off of Camelback!!  The place looks unassuming and chain'ish from the outside, tucked away in a strip mall... but after reading the reviews here, we were ready to give it a try. There is plenty of parking, and we were there around 6PM on a Thursday, which meant no waiting for a table. The family-friendly atmosphere was apparent, as we watched kids and adults alike drawing on the walls and their tables.  As soon as I saw the menu, I knew that alligator nuggets were happening! I've had them a few times before, and these were great! The flavor is a lot like chicken, while the consistency is slightly chewier (like shrimp). This is a great place to try it if you've never had gator before!  One thing I've really missed from home is having a good, cajun seafood boil, and WOW did this place deliver!!! We ordered the veggies, mussels, snow crab and shrimp, with the trifecta flavoring and a spice level of "2" on a 0-5 scale. I'm a spice-lover, and this was just right for me! The crab legs were a hands-down stand out, and the mussels weren't far behind! We loved the shrimp and veggies too, but agreed that next time, we'd probably forego them for more of our favorites! The consumption process is (as with all good boils!) a little messy, so we just poured it out on the table and went to town! (Maybe don't dump all of the sauce, but the rest is fine on the butcher paper.) We stuffed ourselves, enjoying every bite!! It was well-complimented by my Abita purple haze, which I was happy to find on draft. The butcher paper and sink on the side of the room made for an easy post-meal clean up, so that in no time, we were sitting at a nice, tidy table again.  We'll definitely be back soon, and next time, I'll add some red potatoes to the bag! Yum!!

We originally discovered Suh Noi through GrubHub, and were thrilled with the quality of their take-out food! It turned out to be right around the corner from us, so we decided (after ordering it a half a dozen times) to finally go in and check it out.  The building is small and has a drive through window, but don't let that fool you! The place is actually really nice!! They include nice glassware and place-settings on each of the tables, and in prettier weather, their trendy outdoor area looked like it would be a cozy, fun place to hang out.  As far as food goes, I have my favorites for sure. The Dragon Egg (steamed) appetizer is wonderful! If you're not much for spicy food, just take the jalapenos off and they're fine. I believe that there are six to an order, and my boyfriend and I usually polish them off together. (It's sort of like a delicious, moist meatball in a dumpling! So good!!!) My usual main-course is the Pad Thai, which I like to get extra spicy! The flavor is great, and I love that they serve it with some raw veggies that give it a great texture. My only complaint would be the size of the hunks of chicken. If they cut those down a bit, it would be easier to eat with chopsticks and you'd get some chicken in more of your bites. (Right quantity, wrong size.) That said, it's still great!!! My boyfriend usually goes for a chicken and veggies dish, and he's never had any complaints. Of course, the chicken egg rolls are awesome, and a favorite we often order too... As you can imagine, with all of this food, we almost always have a meal for the next day!!   Overall, we were really impressed by this unexpectedly trendy spot! If you're looking for something quick and delicious, check it out one evening. If you have a little more time, they offer some decent wines too.

The Madison has become my new favorite fitness craze! I started taking classes a few months ago with a friend, and you can't beat the fun, high-energy workout that they provide. It feels more like being at a club than a gym, and the atmosphere is perfect for getting you amped up! (Honestly, I'm one of those people that enjoys a workout that doesn't *feel* like a workout. i.e., Zumba, volleyball, rock climbing, etc... and this "party on a bike" is perfect for me!)  I go to Mikey's class, and he's great at keeping everyone engaged, excited and into his routines! The lights, great music and energy at the Madison give it a unique flare that'll have you wondering how soon you can book your next class. I'd definitely recommend it, and plan to make twice-a-week classes part of my 2016 fitness goal!  I just noticed that the pricing has gone up, which is a bit of a shame... the $12 drop-in was wonderful! It looks like you've got to buy 5-packs to get that pricing now... but to be fair, you're going to use all five, so you might as well! (Side note: Shoe rental is usually $2/class. Not bad for beginners who just want to give it a try, but I'm about ready to look for some of my own at this point. YES - they make a huge difference in your workout!)

I'm always excited to try a new place, and in the case of Two Brothers, I'm really glad we did!! A few friends recommended we give it a shot, as they'd been there to try it recently and the food was supposedly really good... So, Super Bowl weekend when everything was swamped, we found a little refuge in this cool, new spot!  The location is great, on North Scottsdale across from Bungalow, and the building itself is very nice. It has a clean but industrial feel, as most breweries do, with awesome skylights that make the place feel fresh and bright. Seating extends up to the second floor, though we sat on the first, and there appear to be plans to put in some large fermentation vats up there, which will be cool.  The menu looked incredible and I wanted to try everything! To start, we shared some smoked salmon and the pretzels. The salmon was okay - not as much my thing, and there wasn't a whole lot of pita/veggies for the amount of dip you get. The pretzels were great, though, and I'd definitely get them again!! I had a hefeweizen that was great and had a strong banana/vanilla flavor.  For my main meal, I was struggling between the fish tacos or the chicken sandwhich, both of which sounded amazing. The waitress was helpful and recommended the fish tacos... I think they sat in front of me a solid 30 seconds before I inhaled them! They were great!!! The batter was light, and everything tasted fresh. The quinoa I got with it wasn't great. I guess I was expecting it to be hot, and when it was cold with a very seedy texture, I left most of that on my plate. I'd probably try the parm fries next time, as the waitress said that those are a big hit.  After we ate, we hung out for a while and I decided to try one of the beer cocktails. It was gin and an IPA, and boy, could those get me into trouble!! I'm not normally an IPA fan, but the hops with the gin made for a great combination! Definitely not something I would've thought to combine on my own, but I loved it!!!  Give this place a shot - I really hope it sticks around!

I was -so- pleasantly surprised by this place!! We went here on a whim when our planned restaurant had an hour wait, and were so glad we stumbled onto it! When we arrived, the downstairs was rented out for a bat mitzvah, and we were welcomed to the upstairs, outdoor seating, which offered a pretty view of Old Town. We used a groupon to purchase two wine flights and a bruschetta, which did not disappoint! Because we were there for dinner, we added in another appetizer of parmesean truffle fries which were out of this WORLD and a panini each.  We were blown away by the appetizers, and thought the paninis were really good, though they were definitely more suited to lunch or happy hour. The chips that came with them were pretty greasy for our tastes, but we had the fries, which were again, amazing, so we were happy to munch on those instead! Service was polite and prompt, and the waitress was quick with our check when we told her we were headed to a movie. We're definitely looking forward to coming back for happy hour and trying some of those $1 oysters... and, of course, more truffle fries!!!  My only wish for this place would be a few entrees that are a bit more substantial... you've made an excellent lunch / happy hour menu, but we'd have loved to see a few options that were more meal-like. Still, loved it!
