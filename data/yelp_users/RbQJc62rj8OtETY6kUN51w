They just got done with their Kitchen remodel.  Food is really expensive.  It is drive through food with sit down prices and tip.  Food was not season well, portions were ok, they wouldn't  honor my full entertainment book 20% discount.  Really!!!  In this market you need all the friends you can get.  Not a good experience.  Won't be back.  I would stick with an Eribertos or the like.

Soothing atmosphere, knowledgeable stylist and affordable.  I found a new home to get my hair cut.  Thank you Candie!
