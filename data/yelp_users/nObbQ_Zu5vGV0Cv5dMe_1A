This is one of the best places to get a deli sandwich. They are nice and piled high on the freshest bread. You get to choose what goes on your sandwich. There are a lot of side items to choose from as well like potato salad, pasta, etc. I am a huge fan of their iced coffee! It also doubles as a store so you can find cute little trinkets and unique grocery items. Hey, if you want chips or candy with your sandwich, you can pick it off the shelf and enjoy it then. They even have a little doggie station with treats and a water bowl.

I have only been here one time but it was a great experience. THe bruschetta is delicious and the wine was great. I really like the bruschetta and wine for $20 deal. You get more than what you pay for. The servers are very knowledgeable and the atmoshpere is calming.

So I would be lying if I said I was excited the first time my friend suggested eating here. My thought process is, why spend money on just a salad bar but boy was my mind quickly changed. There is something for everyone. The health conscious can fill up on the salad bar while others, like myself will hit the soup line as well. Their chili is amazing especially with sour cream and cheese. I always say I will try "that" the next time through but I never get to the next time through. They did lose a star for the price. 2 bucks and some change for a drink? I quickly forget about that once I start eating because it tastes so good. I never thought I would consider eating here a reward for good deeds but it definitely is.

Having a good experience at a doctor's office is hard to come by. I found Caring for Families through my insurance provider. I thought they had to be decent if they were recommended but I am not impressed. The last time I went in to be seen, I didn't wait very long in the waiting room but I waited in an exam room for what felt like an eternity. It was freezing cold. Then when the doctor came in, I felt like I was being rushed and that my opinion did not matter. I was given some antibiotic that I said did not work the last time but the doctor didn't care. I asked for something stronger and was told to come back in a week if I wasn't feeling better. Really? I told you it doesn't work. If you want an appointment within a day or two, they are good but if you can wait for another place, do it.

I have been bringing my Yorkie to them since I got him back in 2008. The receptionists are always friendly and learn who patients are very quickly. The veterinarians are great at diagnosing issues. You can definitely tell that they are animal lovers. They were there for me when I first got him and I found out that the breeder I got my dog from had given him his rabies vaccine in his bottom instead of his nose. They helped calm me down and made everything ok.

Before I start writing my review, I want to state that I did not get my hair done, but I got my nails done here. Last week I took one of my dogs to get groomed and the groomer told me it would be a little longer than the hour and a half it usually is so I was looking for something to do while I waited. This place was right next door and it had been a while since I got my nails done so I went inside. I was greeted quickly and was passed off to one of the women that does the manis/pedis,. Her name was Badoura. I thought her prices were reasonable so I decided to get my fingers and toes done.        The pedicure was nice because for $35 I received a scrub, massage and paint. I paid $5 less because I was a new client. The pedicure felt really nice and I was definitely relaxed until the end. This was just like any other pedicure I had gotten anywhere else. It was the manicure that changed my whole experience.        I sat down and she started working on my nails. Then she pulled out the cuticle stick so she could push the cuticles back. While she was doing this, she decided to go down the sides of my nails instead of just the top where the cuticle is. When she got to my pinkie, I felt a shooting pain and noticed she made it bleed from using the stick. I let her keep going because I figured it was just dry skin that was pulled off. When she was finished with my cuticles, she started the painting. I wanted the gel polish so it would last longer so I had to pay more for that. From where I was sitting, it looked like she was doing a good job. It was after I got home that I noticed that she did a bad job. I was looking at my nails and saw that a couple of nails had bubbles from the top coat and some were messed up from the massage she gave me after the polish was applied. Some of the nails even had too much top coat applied so it was overflowing to my fingers. This wasn't the worst part. Yes... it gets worse.        That night I sat down to watch tv and my fingers started hurting. It was weird because they never felt this way after a manicure before. Upon looking closer, I noticed that several of them were pushed into my skin almost like they were ingrown. I know it takes a few days to become in grown but she did push pretty hard going down the sides of my nails so she must have pushed them down into the skin. I have had ingrown nails before so I knew what I had to do. I think I had 4 or more nails that needed to be fixed. I thought it was going to be an easy fix and they would feel better in the morning. I was wrong... they hurt even more. They were so bad that I thought I would have to go to the doctor because they were infected. My fingers were so bad that I couldn't grip anything without a sharp pain running through my hands. It was really hard to do my everyday routines because I use my hands so much. To make it even worse, I am a musician so playing my instrument wasn't possible. Finally, a week later, I was able to fix them and the horrible experience was over.  I have never had an experience like that before and even though she has "experience," and offered to redo my manicure, I did not want her coming anywhere near my nails again.

I found out about this place through the ASPCA. I recently adopted a dog and they were on the list for a free puppy exam. I am a teacher so naturally I am broke so the word free did it for me. The staff was really nice and told me to fill out first time paperwork. The vet was very knowledgeable and went through everything with me. I haven't had any bad experiences since but I did call one night around 9pm because my dog had gotten into something and I wanted to know if I should bring him in. The lady on the phone was very condescending and rude. My dog is like my child so I called in a panic. Instead of making me feel better, she made me feel worse. Ok so it was 9pm but they are open until 10. Other than this incident, they have been great.

I have never really been "antiquing" and I had some time to kill before I had to meet Jeff at Scottsdale stadium so I decided to stop in and look around. When I walked in, it was overwhelming but exciting at the same time. There were little sections for each person selling their things.  I saw clothing from the 40's, cassette tapes, which are ancient to the kids today, old cameras, and a lot of other cool things. Of course I found some awesome things that I ended up walking out with. I bought a chinese calligraphy clock, a Route 66 sign for my dad, a Cal Ripken Jr. plaque, and a huge Asian inspired picture. Lucky for me, I bought most of the things from the same vendor that was doing 50% off everything that was not on sale.  The staff was very helpful too! I had several things in my hand and one of them offered to take them to the front. I even had help out to my car. I will defnitely go back!

I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place yet! They have one of the best happy hours, in my opinion. This is always the place I go if I am craving sushi. I like to be entertained so I am usually at the sushi bar watching the sushi chefs at work drinking my huge bottle of Kirin Light. I am not a fan of the raw stuff so I go for the tempura rolls and vegetarian rolls and they are fantastic.  I always order too much but can you blame me? I have never had a bad experience here. I also love the location. It is right next to the Tempe Improv and right at the corner of a major intersection. Every time I go in there, it is busy! Whenever someone asks for a sushi recommendation, this is the place I recommend.

I am a huge theatre fan. I am always on the lookout for good shows and the Gammage is the first place I look. There is never a bad seat in the house because of the way it is built. I have always sat in the balcony area because I am a teacher and we know how much they get paid, but I am always able to see what is going on and I still have a great time.      The last show I saw was Mamma Mia and it was amazing! The acoustics are fantastic, and being a band teacher, it sticks out. I am always pleasantly surprised that I can hear all of the actors clearly and be able to hear the orchestra accompany the songs.     The reason I gave it four stars, is because of the bathroom fiasco. There are several bathrooms but whoever installed them,was definitely not a woman because there were only 2 stalls for 2 levels of seating for women. I have hit the bathrooms at the right time and the wrong time. The wrong time was standing in line for the entire intermission only to finish as the lights were cueing us to go back to our seats. Of course, you forget about the inconvenience when the show starts back up again.       I am looking forward to going back to see another wonderful show soon!

I love going here to play pool and having a couple of drinks. I have never had an issue and the drinks are really good. Whenever I want to go out and have a good time, I suggest Mill Cue Club. My fiance and I had our first date here and have been coming back every since.  I love going on Sundays because it is only $4.00/hr all day to play pool. It is usually not that busy either. If it is, I still have not had to wait too long for a table. The drink specials are really good too. I kind of have an obsession with one of the pictures on the wall too. Random I know but I always take the table that is next to that picture.  I do try to avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights though because it gets so packed that you can't move.

I love this hotel! I try and stay here when I come to Vegas. The rooms are always nice and the pool area is huge. It is so nice to have restaurants on the top floor and the exhibits that are featured right now are awesome. I went to the Titanic exhibit and it was so cool how they got allot that stuff in there. The only real complaint I have is the location on the strip. It is a little bit of a walk to the center of the strip. I am even thinking about getting married in the chapel! It connects to Mandalay Bay top so you can check out the shark exhibit. Give it a chance and you will like it too.

This is one of the best dog parks in the area. I live in Phoenix and drive to this one. It has three different fenced areas. Usually one two are open at a time so there is one for the big dogs and one for the small dogs. I have two small dogs so it is nice to know that my dogs can play with other dogs their size. Most of the time the people are friendly and social. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because there are those people that will bring their big dogs in with their smaller dogs because they think their big dog is ok with the little ones. There have been instance where the big dogs have bullied the little ones and have made others mad. I also love that this place is very populated most of the time. I usually like to go around 8pm because that's when other start to bring their dogs. It is huge and equipped with a sand area so my dogs always find something to do.

I am a band teacher so naturally, I need to be in contact with a music store. This place was actually recommended to me so I tried it. The staff is very friendly and they always have what I am looking for. This is also the same place I take my instruments to, to get repaired. I really like that teachers get extra discounts because we buy in bulk. The sheet music selection is amazing and 20% off. It just sticks that there are no stores in Phoenix. One day...

It is really hard to find a good gynecologist these days. I went to one that wouldn't see me because I was 5 minutes late from being stuck in traffic. This place is clean and has the coolest setup. The front end staff are quick and have the latest technology. When I got back to the exam room, there was a tv that talked about the doctors and the practice. I saw Brittani, one of the nurse midwives, and she was fantastic! She told me that I am the only one that knows my body so she believed everything I was saying. She was very patient with me and gave me medicine that works for my issues. I love this place and recommend it to any woman that needs a good doctor.

I am not up on all of the Irish bars in Phoenix but I found out about this one through a friend, whose husband is the bass player for the Keltic Cowboys. I have been here a few times and have enjoyed myself. I gave it four stars because it is a little cramped when there is a band and our waitress was not the greatest because we had to wait forever for our checks.     Last time I went, they were having a Halloween costume party and the Keltic Cowboys were playing so I decided to go. I tried their drink called, The Dirty Pear, which is Guinness and Pear Cider. It was yummy! That night I also tried the fries or the "chips" as they call them. I was expecting an appetizer size since I ordered it off the appetizer menu but the waitress brought out a conical basket full of fries. I was able to full up on them so I didn't have to buy more food.  This place is a little hard to see because it is in a shopping center so you have to be on the lookout for it. I usually just type it into my Google maps and be on the lookout when I am close. I recommend coming here and checking out The Keltic Cowboys!

I always believe in second chances but I should have just left it at that. I gave them more like 5 chances and each one was the same bad service. First, we walk in and we have ditsy hostesses who act like they have no idea what they are doing. I don't think there is even a floor plan for the servers. I don't think I have been approached and ackknowledged in under 15 minutes. The waitresses are sitting at the bar flirting with the guys for bigger tips. I think it's pretty safe to say that servers can see that we have not been helped if we are sitting at the table without drinks. The problem is they don't care. I blame that more on the manager than anyone else.        The last time I waited and even got a look from a waitress with the hope that we would be ackknowledged. Nope! Walked right past. I had enough so I got up and left and made sure to let them know that they missed out on a money making opportunity. I hope this place gets replaced with a restaurant that values customer service!

I obviously love this place if I bowl here every Tuesday night! The lanes are always maintained and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Of course because I bowl here every week, I know most of the staff by name. I am really picky about where I bowl because I have my own equipment and want to keep it in working condition. I live in central Phoenix but will drive down to Chandler just to bowl for fun because I haven't found another bowling alley that is just as great or better than here.

This is the only place I go for my haircuts. I have a wonderful hair stylist Angela, that always does a great job. The front desk staff know me by name and are always so nice. I only gave it 4 stars because the spa side was not as great of an experience for me. I went through 4 different estheticians because they all left.  My mom always said that there are 2 things you should spend money on; your hair and your face. While it is not cheap to have a service done here, I definitely get what I pay for. I see a master designer so I pay more than some people but it is worth it to me because my hair looks amazing every time. If you are someone like me that only wants the best haircut, then come here and ask for Angela!

I LOVE this market! I get up early most Saturdays just to get there before everything I like is sold out. I made it early enough today to get Southern Boy Soup's biscuits and gravy. I always end up spending too much money but at least the money goes to local businesses. It is so much fun walking around watch people interact with each other and seeing the dogs greeting each other. Of course, I have my favorite vendors. I always stop at What's Your Grind for their iced coffee because it is amazing. They know me now because I go so much. Being a regular at this market is so much fun. I get popular things saved for me and I get a heads up when something new is coming. Last week I was introduced to Blueberry Bread from one of the bakeries, and it is like eating a blueberry muffin. I even got my fiancé hooked on it. I had to buy another loaf today. ll of the vendors are so friendly and don't pressure you into buying what you are sampling. If you haven't been, GO!!

I have been to this place a few times now and I have enjoyed myself every time. My fiance hosts a football UYE so we usually sit on the patio to enjoy the morning breeze. I love breakfast so I looked the breakfast menu over and chose the mass confusion. I gave them 4 stars because last time I went, I was charged for the complimentary coffee bar. We did get it taken care of but to have the server tell us it wasn't free and not even check is not good in my book. Usually the staff is phenomenal and try to make it the best experience for you. So... I get the mass confusion, which was literally 4 inches off the plate. It was biscuits covered in gravy, tater tots and eggs. It was amazing!!! I was only able to eat a quarter of it but took the rest home to snack on the next day or so. I felt a little embarrassed at first but the next time I went back, people were ordering it all around me. I wanted to order it for a second time but decided to get the blueberry pancakes. Just as good!

I have never really been a fan of frozen yogurt because I have always thought it wasn't as good as ice cream... until Yogurtland. They always have a lot of yogurt flavors to choose from so it is easy to find a flavor you are in the mood for. I am a fan of cake so the fact that I can find yogurt that tastes like Red Velvet cake, is fantastic! I think I enjoy the toppings just as much as the yogurt itself. How many ice cream places let you choose from a variety of toppings and not charge for each one? This is definitely the place i go if I want some yummy yogurt!

I LOVE THIS PLACE! This is the best place to get beer and wine because they have everything. I can only find my favorite Moscato here. I love the mix and match so someone as indecisive as me can try one of each. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  I recently attended a "Meet the Makers" event at the Camelback location and got to meet Jake Leinenkugel. We tried samples and listened to how each beer was thought up. The growler fill station is so cool. I have yet to purchase one. Whenever they have tastings I am always the first in line because I may find my next favorite beverage. This is always the first place that comes to mind when I need a refill.

I just went to this place this weekend per an invite from a fellow Yelper. I had never heard of this place so when she asked if I wanted to come here, I had to ask her what it was. This is very much a Dive bar. When I walked in, it was exactly what I expected. It is very small with a stage in the corner and a patio out back for the smokers.  There is really only one reason I gave it the 2 stars and not 1. It had Magic Hat #9 on tap. There was also a great selection of spirits. I tried a Jack Honey and coke and it was so good.  The night we went, there were live bands performing. Usually I love going on those nights but this one was just too loud. I couldn't even talk to someone unless my mouth was in their ear. As far as the clientele goes, it was definitely goth night. That is not usually my crowd. Eventually, we decided to visit the patio and I thought it was nice. It was definitely not as loud so you could have a conversation but you have to be ok with cigarette smoke. I never mind trying out new places but unfortunately, I was not impressed. Maybe it will be different the next time.

I LOVE this place! It is a small bar owned by a guy named Brad. The best part is, it is a Vikings bar! Go Vikes! I first experienced this place when I lived in Ahwatukee. My friends and I were looking for a good bar to eat at and watch a baseball game.  Brad's has a huge menu that can be overwhelming but I always enjoy having a lot of options. I remember ordering the Grilled Cheeseburger. It was two grilled cheese sandwiched with a burger in the middle. It was to die for. I have been back a few more times since then and every time, I have had a pleasant experience. I will recommend this place to people new in the area because I like it so much.  I attended the Football UYE this past Sunday and, unfortunately, watch the Vikings lose but had a great time anyway because the bartender/server was great and kept our refills coming. I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal that comes with eggs and breakfast potatoes. It was delicious. Another person ordered the Pork Loin sandwich and it was bigger than the bun. I will continue coming here when I have the chance. Heads up, it is hidden in the Safeway parking lot on Elliott and 48th Street so make sure you are on the lookout because it is a small place.

I love to go here for my book club books. Rather than having to pay full price, I get the same book for half and they are in really good shape. I love being able to find older books and 1st editions as well. The clearance section is really nice and the store is very well organized. The other thing that makes it a great place is the teacher discount!

I love Nutrition 101! The Smith family make it easy to feel good about yourself! I know lots of people think that they are just trying to fill their pockets but they are truely into changing the eating habits of society today. I am always there on the weekends because it is just fun to hang out and socialize. Oh and the owner is Maurice, not Carlos. Lots of people assume before actually giving them a chance. Come in and see what you get out of your visit!

I never knew this place existed until I went out to lunch with a coworker. She is obsessed with sushi and would go here everyday all day if she could. For me, I have to be in the mood for sushi but this place has a lot more options for those that want something a little different. The first time we went, I ordered sushi since that is what my coworker recommended. I thought it was very good and really enjoyed the shrimp tempura and chicken teriyaki rolls that I ordered. Since I am a teacher, I can't always afford sushi so I have also tried the ramen, yakisoba, and lunch bowls. Every dish was great and I always went home with left overs. I really liked the way these dishes were seasoned. I have never had too much sauce or not enough.    I have to say that the owners are fantastic too. Every time we go in, I am greeted by name and asked how my day is going. They knew my name after the first trip. It also feels great knowing that I am supporting a local business and not a chain. I have recommended this place to others because I really liked every dish I ordered. My fiancé went with us one day and he liked it as well. If you are looking to support a local sushi business, this is definitely the place to go. It does get a little cramped during lunch time but that just solidifies the fact that the food is good.

I am always a sucker for ice cream and cookies. Who isn't? Well what if I told you that you could have both at the same time for only $2 bucks? Even better right? Not only do you get to pick the flavor of ice cream that goes in between the cookies but you also get to pick the cookie flavors you want on the outside. That's right, flavors. They have several cookie trays with different flavors and you get to pick which two cookies you want with your ice cream. I don't think I really need to say any more. Just go and try one!

This is a great place to bring your animals to get groomed. This is a brand new location but the owner has been grooming for years. I have been getting my dog groomed by her for over 4 years now. I have a Yorkie and his haircuts always turn out great. My dogs are never afraid to go inside and the employees love seeing my dogs too. They know them by name. The great thing is that the dogs are not put in cages when they are done. They are out with the groomers where they have company. It is located in a shopping center so you can easily get your errands done will your dog is getting groomed. I like how it only takes an hour unlike other places that say it will be at least 3 hours. Check it out! You will not be disappointed.

This place is your typical sports bar with TVs showing all of the sports channels. I went here recently to watch Sunday football and ordered the Italian Nachos. It seems to me like they kept a lot of the food from when it was Coach and Willie's but I liked their food so I was happy. It was nice and quiet for a football Sunday. The bartender was very friendly and fast. I really enjoyed being able to hear the people I was with without having to breath down their necks to hear them. I will definitely go back.

I recently went here as a UYE. I ordered the moo shoo chicken and it was yummy. While most are giving it 5 stars, I am giving it 4 stars because there were not very many dishes that I could eat or wanted to eat. The green beans were amazing though.   I quickly found out that I have enjoyed eating very Americanized Chinese dishes with the sesame chicken and sweet and sour chicken.   I was very surprised with the location of it and actually drove past the entrance but I finally made it. It is in a rough part of Tempe but once your inside, it is not that bad.  I started looking at the menu and was looking for the eggrolls and edamame and all of the dishes I a used to but to my surprise none of those were on there. There was pork belly however. I did not try it when it came around but everyone who ate it really liked it. The menu was very helpful because it was marked by spiciness. I do not like spice so I made sure to stay away from the *. The food looked amazing when it came out and I tried everything I could.   I would like to go back and try more things so I can experience more authentic Chinese. The setting is like other Chinese restaurants though.  Here are some item that others have recommended: Porkbelly in the appetizers Eggplant Glazed green beans kung pao chicken

I am a purse freak! I love finding the cutest and nicest purses, so naturally, I wanted a Coach purse. I bought my first purse in July! Yay! Go me! I had it for about 3 months and it started ripping. I was upset but had read about their lifetime guarantee and repair service. I brought it back to the Coach store I purchased it at and paid the $20 shipping fee. It took about a month to hear back but when I did, I was so shocked! I had purchased my purse for $80 because it was in clearance and it was a 50% off day. When I got a letter from Coach, inside it said, "We are sorry that your purse did not meet the expectations of Coach. Enclosed is a merchandise credit for the value of the purse." It was a credit of $287!!  I had to do a double take because I thought for sure that wasn't right. I paid 80 and got 287? Needless to say, it was correct. I had the option of getting my old purse back in lieu of the credit but why would I? I went back to Coach and bought a nicer purse, travel bag and money left over. I guess the saying, you never know unless you try, was the moral of this story! The purse I have now is wonderful and the staff was very helpful.

I went here for the first time this week. Jeff wanted to check it out for a possible Sunday UYE meet up. He knows how much I love burgers so he took me on Wednesday for the burger and a beer special. I was almost going to stay home because I was exhausted but I am glad I went. It is a small space but cute at the same time. While I was looking at the menu I saw that their burgers were in the top10 in the world. That got me excited to try it. The beer selection was very different because they were beers that are not as popular to the area but I found one that was really good. Then... my burger came out. Holy cow, literally! It came out in a pretzel bun with fries. I had to strategize how I was going to eat it because it was so big. Once I took my first bite, I was in heaven. Burgers are one of my favorites so you can imagine that I was enjoying every bite. It just melted in my mouth. I am making my mouth water right now just writing about it. Anyway, great place and I will definitely be back.

So my fiance and I went here tonight to see what all of the hype was about! WOW! This is the coolest "grocery store" I have seen in a long time. I felt like I could have spent a long time in there. I was blown away with all of the different specialty stations it has. My favorite is the sweets and coffee bar. I walked away with a mouth watering Red Velvet Cupcake that I will be devouring shortly. Across the way is a juice station with fresh produce and the juices are made fresh, on the spot. Jeff was in awe at the seafood station but I was eyeing the meat station. I ended up walking away with a teriyaki salmon burger instead of a beef burger. Who knew?  I will definitely be going back when I have a little more time to spend browsing. I will just have to bring cash with me or I will probably buy everything in the store. I was and still am truely amazed with this place.

I want to start off saying that I don't like exercising so it is hard to get up to go to a gym. I used to have a membership to LA Fitness but cancelled it because I was not going enough to make it worth the monthly payments. I thought I was done with monthly payments to gyms but I was wrong. My fiancé told me he was going to start a workout plan with his health coach and asked me to go with him. I was hesitant at first and was going with the intent of being his guest so I could give the place a chance. He told me that there weren't any Zumba classes and that it was just equipment so it made me hesitant even more. Now I am so glad I went.      When I walked in, the staff was very welcoming and wanted to help. My fiancé told them that he was meeting someone here and that he was his guest. One of the staff members, I think it was Casey, asked if we would like a tour. I said sure because it was different from other gyms and I wanted to see it. As we were walking around, I noticed stations named 30 minute workout and 12 minute abs. I asked what they were and was told that they are stations that are timed and the red and green lights control the workout. When the light is green, you use the machine. When it turns red, you rest and move to the next one and the process just repeats. I thought this was so cool. The machines are clearly marked to point out what muscles are being worked on.        I really like their idea of the judgment free gym. Often times I would go to LA fitness and there would be these buff guys lifting weights with their cut off shirts and huge arms. I would always be afraid to go over and work on my arms for fear of looking like an idiot because I was doing it wrong. I always was afraid of being judged. Planet Fitness is only worried about fitness for all. They have a clunk alarm that goes off when anyone drops weights or tries to be too cool. They make it a place where anyone can go to workout without judgment. This was a big selling point for me.           The thing that makes this place better and different is the Black Card membership that gets you unlimited use of their tanning beds, hydro massage machines, red light therapy and massage chairs. What other gym has all of those things included in the membership cost? One try of these machines and I was sold. I sat down and signed up on the spot. I was expecting to have to pay a huge amount per month to get this membership but it is only $19.99/month. I was floored!! Ever since I signed up, I have been going regularly because I get excited to go and workout knowing that no one is judging me and I get to use all of this awesome equipment. Did I mention that a personal trainer is included in the cost? Usually you have to pay hundreds of dollars for a personal trainer but not here. I was lucky enough to be there the same night that the trainer was there so I sat down with her so she could build me a workout plan. I have been sticking to it ever since. I have a new found motivation to get off of the couch and exercise because of this place. If you haven't checked it out, YOU NEED TO!!

So... my fiance and I decided to check this place out since the grand opening was today. To be honest, I was a little skeptical about eating at a restaurant in a grocery store. I was proven wrong! This restaurant is fantastic. The reason for the 4 stars is strictly for the prices.  There are a bunch of beers on tap from the local breweries as well as wine. I decided to do the 4 beer flight to try out some new beers. I decided that my favorite out of the four was the Magic Hat #4. I took the tasting sheet as a note to self. Of course, we went there to eat too so Jeff ordered the Kale salad and I ordered the burger. While we were waiting for the food, i decided to check out the wine section of the store. Holy Cow! I found a bottle of Moscato for $3.99. Once the food came out, I did have to send the burger back to be cooked a little longer because it was definitely not medium but the waitress asked if I would like something to munch on while I wait. I decided to try the tater tots. Unfortunately, they came out with my burger but those were the best taer tots in the world. They were made with cheese and chives and were as big as my thumb. I was in heaven. Then I bit into my burger and I was sold. It was so juicy and melted in my mouth. The smoked paprika aioli that they put on it was fantastic and really brought out the flavor of the burger. I had to slow down at one point because I was chowing down. Our waitress was so nice. When Jeff asked for the check, she told us that it was taken care of because I had to send the burger back and the tots were sent out with the burger instead of before. We were both in shock because we are not those people that complain to try and get a comped meal. Let's just say that she got a nice tip. I will definitely go back to try more of the wonderful looking food and sample some more beer.

I want to start off saying that I love dogs! I have two of my own so of course when I found out that this was being built directly across from the school I work at, I was there for the grand opening and several times since. There are two gated areas, one for small dogs and one for big dogs. I have to go to the small dog one as I have 2 small dogs.  I gave it 4 stars because there is always a shortage of waste bags when I go and it is a little smaller than I would have liked. My dogs don't seem to mind though. It is cute because there is a tree with a place to sit under it while your dogs are running around.  I obviously love the location because I live 5 minutes from work so that means I only live 5 minutes from this place (Remember, I work at the school across the street). It is a lot easier for me to want to take my boys if I only have to drive 5 minutes instead of 25 minutes. It is definitely cleaner than other dog parks I have gone to and I think that is because there is a crew that gets together to clean it and go over any improvements. I do have to say that I really like the design of the fences. It is definitely unique and different. If you have dogs, I would highly suggest giving it a try to see what you think but for my dogs and I, it is very convient.

I am not going to lie when I say that I had a little too much fun that night. I was invited to the Gala itself so I was feeling pretty good when I got to the after party. It consisted of an open bar and dessert samples for everyone to try. I think I tried them all because who wouldn't want free samples? I really liked the chocolate cheesecake squares. Besides food, there was a photo booth and face painting so I did both of them because I am a kid at heart (no pun intended). My fiancé and I decided to pick out masks for our pictures so I chose a Dia de Los Muertos skull mask and he chose Barak Obama. Yes... there was an Obama mask. Then I went to go stand in line to get my face painted. The gala was a masked theme so the face painter was painting masks on people. I had her paint a replica of the mask I picked up at the door. She was pretty spot on with what it looked like. It was a little crooked but hey, I don't paint so who cares? By the end of the party, we were getting tired so we headed out but I will never forget the wonderful time I had and the wonderful Yelp hosted after party.

This place has the best cakes I have ever eaten. I used to live in the area and would pass by it but never went in. One of my friends bought me the red velvet cake for my birthday two years ago and I devoured it. It was so delicious and even had chocolate chips in it. My fiance and I are planning on having these cakes for our wedding cake. The staff is always helpful and they have cakes for every occasion. Sure there is a big hole in the middle of it and it doesn't look like the typical cake but WOW is all I can really say except get here and try a sample!
