This is quickly becoming my favorite place. The pho is excellent. I favor the chicken. The service is usually good and the servers are very friendly. The prices are excellent.

I am very sad I didn't check yelp. I hired this company to get rid of bees. I asked ahead of time if they guaranteed their work and they said yes. The price I was told would range between 145-195. They removed the bees and told me it would be another 400 to take out the honey comb which I was not told up front . They charged 195 and I still have a yard full of bees. I do not recommend them. They are not honest up front and apparently don't care if the job gets done. My next stop is better business bureau.
