First let me tell you that I love Mexican food, I've eaten some in Mexico as well as Arizona, and I have developed a good palette for 'spicy.' However - I go to a restaurant like On The Border the same way a film buff should approach a Michael Bay movie. I know what I'm getting and I'm not going to act all surprised when it's not the best I've ever had.  That said - I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to On The Border and would return in a heartbeat (especially for happy hour).  Went with a girlfriend for happy hour and ordered a half-price appetizer in the form of their steak quesadilla. It was very large despite the price and really delicious. I used to have a few quesadillas a week during my "cheese, cheese, and more cheese" phase growing up - so I hold quesadillas to a pretty high standard. This was a delicious start to the meal.  The girlfriend ordered the pulled-pork baja fajita with salsa, I ordered the chimichanga with beef and queso underneath. Couldn't resist a Dos Equis Ambar for $2.25. They brought it in a goblet that was frozen and as a result there was a bit of slush at the top of the glass but really, when your only complaint is that "the beer was too cold," you know you've had a good dinner.  I had a few bites of hers and completely devoured mine, which was an impressive feat considering I had eaten most of the quesadilla earlier. Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh. The queso under my chimichanga added just the right amount of spice and I was lucky to have arctic-chilled brew in arm's reach.  Like Rand before me, I'm not exactly surprised by the negative reviews I've read for this location but that certainly wasn't my personal experience at this On The Border. Can't wait to go back.

I'm not going to complain about the quality of the meat. I'm not going to complain about the calories involved. I'm not going to do any of those things because I'm not an idiot. I know what I'm getting when I go to a chain restaurant like Red Robin that offers endless french fries.  Needless to say, the girlfriend and I came in around 3 pm for an unhealthy, self-indulgent diner snacking. We started things off with their chips, salsa, and guacamole. It was better than one would expect, largely due to their "jalapeno chips" which are crunchy and delicious. Much better than the standard tortilla chip and I expect much more unhealthy as well.  My girlfriend isn't a vegetarian but she ordered a veggie burger anyway and I got a Royal Burger, which is essentially a plain old cheeseburger but with a fried egg on it. Both of us loved our burgers. I tried hers and it was delicious. She tried mine and thought the same. We both had a beer (I had Dos Equis, she had Corona Light) to wash it down and in the end, we couldn't complain about anything.  We had a fun time, it was delicious, and I got what I paid for. Absolutely no *reasonable* complaints that I can think of. I like to curve each review to cater to the expected quality of the restaurant, so understand a 5 on Red Robin doesn't compare to a 4 at Cheesecake Factory, but this particular Red Robin did a really good job. I'll be back again soon, even if it does look a little "ghetto" on the outside.

Got a Reuben with sauerkraut on the side for take-away. It's listed in the "Hot Sandwiches" menu. Turned out it was anything but - which is a surprise because I work very close by. Beyond that, the pastrami was unsavory and the thousand island was a runny soup that didn't do much to make up for the low temperature.  Chompies up the street knows how to make a tasty Reuben (albeit over-sized); I regret not grabbing my sandwich there. Won't be getting another Reuben at Munch-a-mania, but I might try breakfast sometime hoping for better results.

If you would think visiting this restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night would be a prime opportunity to experience what "Sushi Eye in Motion" is all about - you would be wrong. At least, I would hope you were wrong. If this service was indicative of what the restaurant is at their best, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I was in a party of three sitting down at the bar, hoping to make a number of selections from the rotating sushi bar - but the items I saw were not to my liking (lots of spicy tuna) and they looked as though they had been there for some time.  Now here's where it gets awful - those same items rotated around the entire time I was there. 50+ minutes and those were the only items I saw on the rotating bar. We ordered a small number of things to start off (I always make sure to get 'saba' and 'ikura' at every sushi place I go to) with the intention of grabbing some plates off the conveyor belt, but there were never any plates added.  The stuff we ordered was good. The mackerel was delicious and the salmon roe was good. Everything else was decent, but the dissatisfaction with the failure to deliver on their gimmick was enough to dissuade my appetite. If I ever went back, or if you ever decide to go, I would sit at the bar and have a drink first. Just watch and see if they add anything new to the rotation or if there's any variety. If there isn't, I would leave and go somewhere better (I love Kabuki at Tempe Marketplace).  Imagine how horrible it would be for anyone to sit down after we had left and grab some of the sushi that had likely been there for an hour or more. To quote one of my favorite videos on YouTube - "unforgivable."

I can't guarantee that anyone will share the experience I have at the Oriental Garden, but know that my four star review isn't curved much just because "it's a buffet."  I have been many times (it's the go-to buffet as far as I'm concerned) and each time the staff is friendly, inviting, and attentive. Besides for being hit on occasionally by the waiter because I vaguely resemble Harry Potter, the atmosphere feels authentic enough and the seats are soft enough to ensure comfort while I dine. Comfort is important, here, because for the next hour or so I am going to be eating as much as humanly possible and I'd like to be comfortable before the well-earned stomach ache kicks in.  The price is pretty great considering the amount of food at your disposal. As a fan of sushi, it's nice to see them offer a few varieties (yellowtail, tuna, salmon) including my all-time favorite: mackerel. Not many buffets offer sushi and even less offer good sushi, but Oriental Garden does a good job with its raw fish. Some places make you eat the rice as well, perhaps hoping to limit the amount of sushi you can possibly manage to consume. Not here. I especially like that they've removed the rice from the mackerel and offer it as sashimi now. It probably depends on the hour you go, but around 5pm it's delicious and at least the very least, it feels really fresh.  I usually eat about half sushi, and half "other stuff." This includes a plethora of options - great ribs, shu mai, orange chicken, mongolian beef, baked salmon, and so much more. This is obviously not the ideal setting for a health-nut so I have no qualms recommending the coconut shrimp and the sweet 'n sour chicken as my personal favorites.  They have ice cream and desserts but I hardly ever have any room left over once I'm done with all the dinner options. Gave it four instead of five because the consistency isn't always there, occasionally you can eat something that doesn't have the right texture or seems like it's been out for a while, but the overall experience is always very satisfying for me. It's easily the best buffet I've been to in Arizona outside of Golden Corral. If anyone knows of a better oriental buffet - please let me know. If you haven't tried Oriental Garden - what are you waiting for?

A friend told me he was taking me somewhere "interesting." Understatement of the year. The atmosphere was rich, the food was great, the service was friendly and the music was phenomenal. I don't know how they choose their tunes but it was the perfect soundtrack to a unexpectedly pleasant evening. I don't like to use the word "hip," but there's almost no better word to describe the experience. This is a great place to take friends and/or family.  Since the pasty's are cut in half, my friend and I decided to order something different and then split. Seeing as it is November and Thanksgiving is just around the corner, we went with 'The Pilgrim' (roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing), and to see how they handle mainstream, we also got the 'Royale With Cheese' - yes, that is an amazing name. It's essentially 'their cheeseburger.'  I had half of each, two glasses of Kronenbourg 1664, and I must say it was one of the best meals I have had in a restaurant in some time. The service was incredible - friendly, personal, and quick - and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to everyone I know, as tempting as it is to keep such a wonderful location as "our little secret."

I've been to a few of the Thai restaurants in Arizona and this remains my favorite. Granted, I don't get too adventurous with the menu, but sometimes when you find something you love, you just have to smother it to death, right? Pad Thai and Curry ALL DAY. I've ordered some other items (curry fish? or something) and they are enjoyable but I typically go with the same old same old.  Soup is always tasty. Thai Tea is almost worth the trip on its own. Lunch prices are fair and portions are good. I may be biased because I'm a regular but I'm a regular for a reason. Order the Pad Thai with Chicken and/or the Red Curry with Chicken and you'll know why I go back again and again.

Went for Sunday brunch at 11 am and had a very enjoyable meal. The attitude of the hostesses wasn't as inviting as I would have preferred, but everyone has their off days. They have indoor seating and outdoor, and though it was a perfect day for outdoor, we chose to sit in because there was more comfortable seating.  There were only two things keeping this from being a five-star dining experience. One was the appetizer we chose. Our initial decision came down to two choices: a 'crab and avocado tower' and 'salmon cheesecake.' We went with the tower, which didn't end up looking like a tower at all. It was certainly interesting, but it looked like a Chef Boyardee can had been filled with crab and avocado, then overturned. Once we dug in, it was a solid cylinder of 'meh.'  After a very underwhelming appetizer taste-wise (I knew we should've gotten the salmon cheesecake...) we ordered our dinner. I decided upon the chicken quesadilla. My mates balked at my decision to order a quesadilla when there were so many other options on the menu, but my reasoning was thus: if they are so fancy shmancy, then they'll take something simple like a quesadilla and knock it out of the park.  I was right on the money. I was able to taste the wild mushroom, chicken, and leeks crepe that neighbored my quesadilla, but it didn't compare. The quesadilla and accompanying guacamole was about as good as one could expect to get from a place that doesn't specialize in Mexican food.  If I weren't the type who tries to enjoy all the items on a restaurant's menu, I would definitely order the same thing on a return trip. I had a mimosa and a sangria to wash it down and both were delicious. It ended up being a delicious brunch to kick off what would be an excellent Sunday.  The other thing I didn't really like was our server. She was nice enough, but whenever I declined a suggestion she had made (cookies for desert, for instance) she said, "okay, just checking on ya." She said this multiple times to the point that it became a running gag at our table. It's not really an issue, but it is pestering. This is not my first trip to the rodeo. I know how restaurants work and I understand what a waiter or waitresses' job is, thankyouverymuch.  I will probably return sometime soon. It was very good. Next time I'll sit outside (if it isn't too hot out) and try that salmon cheesecake. Just writing about it is making my mouth water.

Please don't waste your time or your money. For half the price, you would be better off with Domino's - which tastes better. The only positive thing I can say for Cibo E Vino's pizza is that the ingredients are fresh... but the freshness of the pizza does not make up for the lack of taste.  Three pizzas and a batch of those pepperoni rolls (not sure the name, I didn't put in the order) and the total was around $60. A little pricey, but we were feeding 7 total, so I figured that was justified. Until I saw the pizzas, that is. "Dainty" is a nice way to describe them. Any other company would call them small. Flavor? It's there, but you have to concentrate to find it. If you had told me they were just using a fancy frozen dinner, I would have had a hard time disputing the claim.  The food itself is meh, but two stars seems a bit generous for a pizza place that's robbing its customers blind. At this point, I'm just going to believe that location is cursed - no matter which business occupies it.
