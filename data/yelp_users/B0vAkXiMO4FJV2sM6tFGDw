The food is super tasty, the decor is nice, but the service could be improved upon.   My husband and I try to stop here if we're in the area because the food is so delicious and elegantly served. The pad Thai and curries are tasty as is the Thai iced tea (creamy sweet tea with ice). I usually order the yellow curry with chicken.   Lunch hour is very busy so you might get stuck waiting for your server.   Once we went after the lunch-hour rush, but still ended up with sub par service because the staff was eating their lunch.   Despite the sometimes slow service, we come back because of the quality and taste of the food.

We've been fans of Dr. Gilchrist and the staff at Ingleside for four years, and we've been very happy with their work. We just wish they were closer to us in Chandler.   To begin, Dr. Gilchrist is very calm and helpful. He gives our cats thorough exams and doesn't make us feel rushed. He also doesn't try to push products the office sells. (There are multiple vets at this facility, but we prefer Dr. Gilchrist.)  The staff is very friendly. They even let our little tuxedo kitty climb over their desks and around their keyboards. They also handle our big orange tabby well despite how scared he usually is.  The building is modern and spacious, but the prices increased a little bit after they relocated to the new building.  The exam rooms are clean and neat.   If you prefer Saturday appointments, make sure to call as early as possible because Saturday slots go fast.

Fast service, delicious food and excellent prices.   We've been eating at Saigon for about eight years, and highly recommend it if you enjoy Vietnamese food.   The service is very prompt. Our food usually comes within minutes of ordering and it's delicious. The waitresses are friendly. And lunch for two is usually around $15.   Newbie advice:   It's very busy during the lunch rush hour, so get there early.   The decor isn't the finest, but it's the food you'll be eating!   Fish sauce may not smell great, but it's so so tasty.   Not a big Pho (pronounced fawh) fan? Try the char-grilled shrimp and beef over rice, stir fried white onion noodle with chicken or lemon grass chicken over rice (spicy). The Vietnamese spring rolls are also delicious.

The food is fresh and natural tasting. It's simple in ingredients, but complex in flavor. It's not loaded with cheese or heavy sauces. It feels light but filling.  The restaurant is small and charming. It was busy the afternoon we lunched there and ended up waiting an hour for the food. We didn't complain, though, because it seemed as if they were short of staff and our server was elderly.

Maybe I'm a Mexican-food snob, but this was basically overpriced-Del Taco fare. The food was nothing to write home about. It was served on Styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking.

The food is so very delicious and gets a Five Star rating, for that alone. The service is so so, but you'll be able to look past it once their fillet mignon melts in your mouth.   I recommend the koobideh beef especially. It just seems to dissolve into amazingness in your mouth. And for dessert, try the Persian ice cream. Yum.   A combination platter will feed four easy, though the menu says it's for two. My husband and I had so much left over that it served as a lunch and dinner the next day.   One more tip, don't be shy to try the free appetizer. The bread is made fresh in a tandoori-like oven. Spread some butter on it, add lots of basil leaves and some onion and enjoy.

The management seems to know the formula for a good dining experience here if you're looking for a decent priced, tasty Indian buffet   Lunch buffet: Good food particularly liked the goat curry and lentils. The naan was good too. The desert section is missing those delicious popular Indian sweet meats, but their rice pudding was decent.   They told us their meats are HALAL, which is a huge plus for us.   Our experience: We arrived at 2:30 p.m. and the buffet would close at 3 pm, but the server was friendly and quick. They were able to refill a few of the dishes for us. Shortly after, about six more people came for the buffet so the staff refilled more buffet items. If you come late, please check out the buffet first and request your favorites to be replenished.    Tip: I used a check-in coupon from Yelp and promptly received a delicious, cold mango lassi. Don't miss out.

Dr. Young is extremely professional, courteous and trustworthy. He has a pleasant demeanor. And not only that but the billings person and admin (Valerie) is excellent. We've had dentists who were great but who had staff that constantly made mistakes on our insurance paperwork. We were so happy to find an office where they did an excellent job both in front and in the back office.   Dr. Young's dental hygienist is fantastic. She has an excellent memory, by the way. I only see her twice a year, but she seems to remember our conversations from six months ago much clearer than I.   I do wish with they would order thyroid guards for use during their X-rays.   We've been very pleased with Dr. Young and would recommend him to anyone who wants a good quality dentist.

Fresh Cleaners was OK, but the customer service was really lacking.   The young woman at the desk seemed a little unsure and didn't really seem to understand (or maybe didn't know how to explain) their cleaning process when it comes to delicate items.   I felt good about going here because of the "green" cleaning method, but the customer service was a let down. Plus, when I got one of my tops home, a thread had come loose on the cuff. And the fibers seemed very worn, like it had been brushed.

I've visited El Portal about seven or eight times because of its reasonably priced food and proximity to the journalism school. But the food is so-so and the service has ranged from terrible to OK.   El Portal has cheap daily specials. The portions are huge. Make sure to indicate what kind of meat you want in your food. They normally didn't ask me.  The seating area is spacious and they have a TV.   The service is lacking, but I think they're trying to work on it. But don't expect them to stay open until their posted hours. The cashier once told me they close shop 30 minutes before closing time if there aren't any customers.

I'm at the end of my one month unlimited classes Groupon and have loved health benefits from practicing yoga.   The studio is clean with large windows that let in a lot of natural light. It's very relaxing. Their equipment is pretty complete and in good condition. The equipment includes: yoga mats, bolsters, straps, sand bags and blocks. They also have a bottle of organic cleaner for the mats.   The instructors are super friendly and seem very knowledgeable. I really like instructors Leah and Alex. Leah's class really makes you work and it feels fantastic after wards. Alex knows her stuff and is an excellent teacher.   I've taken basic flow, all levels and restorative yoga (so relaxing!). The physical benefits have been fantastic. My core feels a lot stronger and tighter. And I feel less stressed.   My only complaint - which some would see as a positive - is that they heavily stress the religious/philosophical aspect of Yoga. I'm not interested in that. I am interested in the health benefits of yoga as exercise. This includes, core strength, flexibility, stress relief and overall body strength.  I really liked this studio, but wished it stressed the physical benefits more and eased up on the spiritual talk.

Yikes, what a terrible experience at this copy shop. The previous reviews on Yelp from 2011 and 2010 were great, so what happened in 2012?  We went in to use the computer and printer (we were on vacation and needed to work on a spreadsheet for a deadline). Things were fine, though the users next to us were arguing with the temp manager about being overcharged. (I should have taken it as a warning sign.)  An employee standing around told us to pay at the kiosk. We pay, get our receipt and everything is hunky dory. Then I notice the price on the kiosk for the services we used (PC use) was less than what they charged me. We waved over the guy and he seemed confused. We explain it a few times and then we all walk over to the machine. He says the price listed on the kiosk is for using just the Internet with your laptop.  Oh, OK, we say, but we're confused.  We go back to the kiosk and look again at the price sheet. Nope, it's clear they overcharged us. The price listed was for the PC use. My husband asks the interim manager about the price posted and she then starts peeling it off the kiosk! She said it's and old price sheet and closes the matter.  My husband asked to see the sheet again, but she refuses, balls it up and throws it away. At this point, she could have just said, Sorry we left this on sir, our mistake. Unfortunately, I can't change the prices back, etc. But nope, she gets an attitude. My husband asks to see the manager, she says the manager is out. We ask for a phone number to call. She says that would be inappropriate and can't release the number. We say, we just want her office number, and surely she has one. Nope, she's out on leave for the next few months. So I ask for a regional manager. She gives us a card, finally apologizes after my husband demands an apology for the way she treated us. But she gives us one of those, I'm sorry that you're upset apologies. Ugh. Such terrible customer service.  We eventually leave and call the corporate office to file a complaint. We hope they call back so we can recommend some ways to improve their customer service. Sheesh.

We heard back from corporate on the terrible treatment we received at this FedEx location in July 2012. I am happy to report he more than made up for it. The person we spoke with listened to us, apologized, refunded our entire bill and said he would speak with the employee.   Wow. Thank you FedEx; you've won our business back.

I visited the JCPenney Salon on a recommendation from a friend, and was very pleased with the service, cut and price.   I was a little apprehensive about going into a department store for a haircut, but the staff was professional and the prices were excellent.   But the most positive aspect of my visit was how accommodating they were. If you're a hijabi this location can accommodate your request for privacy. I asked the woman on the phone and she was able to arrange it with my stylist. My stylist was extremely nice and didn't seem to mind cutting my hair in the waxing room.   She also did a fantastic job of fixing my hair after a bad haircut I got elsewhere. They also sent me home with a few coupons for my next visit.    I plan on going here again!

I would suggest skipping, but full disclosure, I only ate here once.  And it's unlikely I'll return.   The rice and gyro meat we ordered were decent but overpriced for the portion and quality (reg. $9.99) and the meat was dry. We used every ounce of the tziki sauce they gave us to enliven that meat.   The store/cafe looks a bit disorganized, but I overlooked it. What I did not overlook was the bathroom. It was locked so our server opened it with a credit card from his wallet. Once inside . . . I'll spare you the details.  Just know it was bad.  The staff was friendly though.

Baskin Robbins on Alma School Road:   The ice cream was fine; we ordered a banana split. Here are the two reasons we won't be coming back:   1) The customer service was lacking. The young man at the counter seemed very "chill," and more interested in his phone than anything else. He also forgot to give us spoons. We just used the ice cream-sample spoons on the counter because he seemed too occupied with his cell phone to be distracted by work. No offense, chill counter dude.   2) Scary toilet. The ladies toilet bowl has a hole near the front of the bowl that can spray you! Flush it and a spring of water shoots far enough up from a break in the bowl to splash you if you're near. It's also cracked. Maybe it was a do-it-yourself bidet project gone wrong? I won't be back to find out.

We love local coffee shops and we , but we wont be back. The kona coffee tasted like really bad gas station coffee. I would prefer a cappuccino from QT than what we received. We ordered a large coffee with Macadamia syrup on the recommendation of the woman taking our order. The coffee may be good kona but it wont taste good if you dont know how to make it. And from watching them work, it looks like they need more instruction.  Now to find some gum to take away this foul taste.
