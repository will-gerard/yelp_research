Where to start...I had a horrible experience here. First of all I bought a groupon for a haircut and color retouch. When I called to make an appointment, the receptionist had an attitude but I was still excited.  On the Saturday of my appointment, I forgot what the exact time I was supposed to be there. So I called again and the first thing the receptionist asked me, "Did we not call for a confirmation?" and I replied no, which made me a little uneasy to know they didn't even call me for a confirmation but I was still excited to go.  When I got there, everyone was nice which made less uneasy. My hairstylist was cool but here's where the problem starts. I showed him a video of what I wanted and here's the link (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QtM19eO7Kc&list=WL30C2428FFF694ADF) and he looked at for 10 seconds and said, "Okay cool, you wan't an asymmetrical haircut.  After coloring my hair and straightening it, he proceeded to cut it off. Everything seemed fine. We were talking and he seemed pretty legit. But as my hair got shorter, I started to get scared.   The first problem was he didn't ask me any questions about my hair. Usually hairstylists will ask about my how I style my hair, what exactly I'm looking for and what suits me. He just kept cutting and I guess it was fault for trusting him but he said did hair for 5 years.   He was then interrupted by the receptionist, who told him that his next client was there. He told the receptionist infront of everyone that he needs to schedule better because her hair is taking too long (as if I wasn't there). From there, it got worse.  He started to rush on cutting my hair and it made me more nervous. It looked way shorter then I wanted and he cut my bangs shorter, even though the video has them longer.   When he supposbliy finished, it looked horrible! He didn't even try to finish styling it. I was so embarrassed. He cut my hair the way he wanted and didn't even style it and LEFT DYE ON MY NECK! What was the point of the groupon, if he wasn't even going to style it.   The worst part is when I called the salon back to complain. The  receptionist only offered me a shampoo and blow dry to get rid of the hair dye-which by the way when I washed my hair the next day it all came out. So I paid money for semi-permanent. I wanted to speak with the manager but she was out and the receptionist promised me the manager would call me later that day, but no one has called me yet and its been two days. This was a horrible experience. Now I'm stuck with Kate Gosselin haircut.

Love, love, love Shampoo Ink! I've been going here for the past 5 months and I'm impressed every time I go. Everyone is incredibly nice and the prices are reasonable. My hairstylist Alli B. is amazing!  I went to Shampoo Ink to get a lilac color and Alli listened and wasn't scared of the idea. Even though we didn't do the lilac color that day (I had dark brown hair and was damaged by previous coloring) she and I decided to lighten my hair every month so I don't damage it. Instead we did a purple ombre and it came out great!  I also recommended her to a friend who wanted purple and was skeptical because the other place she went to, did a horrible job, but I'm glad to say that my friend left happy. I would recommend this place and Alli B. to anyone who's looking for an urban, funky, fun place to get your hair done at a reasonable price:)

I bought a groupon and I'm glad I did. If your looking to get your eyebrows done for a great price then this is the place. The beautiful lady who threaded my eyebrow (I did catch her name, sorry)  took her time and it was nice to just pop in somewhere and then leave 5 minutes later with hair still there. She made sure every hair was gone and my eyebrows and lips look great.  She also gave tips on how to grow my eyebrows back faster and listened to what I wanted. I'll definitely be returning. Thanks :)
