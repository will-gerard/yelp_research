It was ok, they messed part of the order. The inside of the store is hot and cramped, and there is no room at all if more than 10 people are in the restaurant.

Guys were prompt and courteous. I wasn't home for the install but installers called regularly to give me updates and even finished early. AC works wonderfully. Like night and day. Thanks guys! Great Job!!

They were out of biscuits of all things. I was finished eating by the time they were ready. The waitress was attentive enough.

These people are great! Engaging, informative, thorough. From the x-rays and exam to the cleaning, I felt very taken care of.. Awesome group of people. Thanks so much for a great first visit!

I don't do this very often, but Cafe Rio you're on my sht list. Keep not paying attention, and wrecking my order. Three times I have been given the wrong order, in the last month. It's a simple matter of, 'you only have one job". Listen. That's it. Love the food. Awful service. All the way down the line.

Awesome haircut! Stan (the owner) did an outstanding job! I take note when people compliment me on a haircut, and I have had several on this one. Thanks guys!

Wonderful Job!! My fianc√© and i went in with a groupon were given wonderful massages. I dont remember the girls names because we were in just after new years. Just wanted to make sure I posted my review.
