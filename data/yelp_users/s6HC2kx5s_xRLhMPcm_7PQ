I'll start off by saying I love P.F. Chang's.  They are one of the few corporate restaurants that consistently get it right.  That being said, I feel a bit bamboozled.    I have my favorites at every restaurant I visit.  I called in last night for my normal Pad Thai to pick up.  I never check the order because I always trust the integrity of the product.  I ordered edamame as well.    I'll set the scene.  I was so excited because I was totally craving rice noodles.  It was later in the evening.  I get settled in and ready to dish up my entree.  As I unpack my Pad Thai, my smile starts to diminish.  What's up with the noodles?!  They are all broken.  Remember when mom used to cut up your spaghetti when you were 5 years old?  Same thing.  Not a long noodle in the entire order!  It's like that sold me noodles that they over cooked and bottom of the pasta boiler.  The chef must have been off last night.  The quality was horrible. What comes to my mind next is, I hope the consistency of the dish is still intact as far as the flavor profile is concerned.  It was.  Thank goodness.  18$ for broken noodles that brought me back to being 5 and having mom cut the spaghetti.  Not priceless.  Insulting.  Watch your quality control, chefs.

Pf Chang's just can't get it right.    It took me a month to get back here.  I finally did.  Take out again as usual.  I called in.  They remembered my order, as all aloha systems do regarding takeout orders.  Fine.  Pad Thai again with a certain amount of fear because of the last experience.  Upon arrival, I choose to inspect my order.  Greeted by a nervous bartender and manager.    They both looked at me like I was violating some takeout rule.  I told them I had a bad experience last time.  I need to check the order.  I likened it to when you're slumming it and have to check your burger before you leave the drive thru.    The manager, never introduced himself, was wearing a blue and white vertical striped shirt and a black suit.    He asked me what had happened upon the last take out.  I told him the noodles were in pieces.  Chopped up.  He literally tossed a free appetizer card over the bar.  I tossed it back.  He returned the motion.  I felt like we were playing air hockey at a certain point.    You will find no personal service from this location.  While walking out, I saw a woman sleeping in a booth.  Literally, curled up.  Food still on the table.  Is she an employee?!  And if so, why is Mr. Manager allowing this impression?!! Get your shit together Pf.!!!

Pork chile stew. I'll start here.    I was nervous at reading the description. I lived in hatch chile country once and I have never heard of potatoes, carrots or corn in my stew.  I understand the potatoes.  But it already had a roux as well. Thicken the stew.   They dolled it up for presentation.  It still made my ears itch.  Spicy the way it should be.  Osso bucco.    Thank you.  Lightly sprinkled with cojita cheese.  Cooked down in red chile sauce, it was absolutely delightful.  I still asked for a side of green chile.  Not because the flavor was absolutely perfect, but because I wanted to pour it over the accompanying.  Carrots.  Corn. Zucchini.  And you guessed it, mashed pots.    I'll be back for the osso bucco.  You should go to the tavern for bucco.  But don't tell me how to eat my pork chile stew!  ;)

I've been looking and longing for an incredible Italian restaurant for over six years of living off and on in the valley.  This is it.  I'll repeat, this is it.    The linguine with clams is nothing short of amazing.  The sauce is light and not overpowering.  I got the white sauce.  The only way clams should be served in my humble opinion.    Caprese salad.  Let's just back up a second and talk about the components. What makes a good caprese?  I'll tell you what.  The balsamic vinegar.  I could bathe in that sweet syrupy delight of what most Americans will never know unless they go abroad to Italy and do a tasting or they happen to work in the restaurant industry.  Absolutely incredible.  The cheese was and is incredible.  There is a creaminess to this mozzarella that possess just the right hint of salt.  No pucker like you find in some rushed mozzarellas.  My only suggestion would be heartier tomatoes.  As this is the season for good Romas and beefsteaks.  I will be back.  And I'm coming for the veal.  Be warned and thank you.  I'm shaking my head with a tear in my eye.

I'm still kicking myself for not venturing into Citizen long ago.  I found myself hungry and wanting a good meal a week back.  Citizen had always been in the back of mind and I decided to make my way to Old Town and give it a try.  Do not walk, run to Citizen.    I was greeted warmly by staff and a lovely atmosphere.  Dark wood beams surrounded by warm butter colored walls and soft candle light.  White table cloths and black and white pictures adorn the walls of this beautiful structure.  I started with the pastrami pork belly with hints of horseradish that play perfectly with mustard and brussel sprouts.  A dish that could be too rich if executed carelessly.  Absolutely perfect.  Followed by the scallops.  Perfectly cooked to medium rare.  Very sweet with the right amount of pan sear.    The staff is attentive and not overwhelming.  I felt at home.  I'm still dreaming of the pastrami pork belly.  Well done, my friends.  Well done.

What's a hungry girl to do after a long night a work?  Most of us in the industry get to the point where we crave variety which makes us venture out into our neighborhoods to see what everyone else is offering.  I found myself on the quirky Windsor patio this past weekend.  It was around 10 pm, we were seated and greeted by our server very promptly.  The patio itself is in the round.  Plush intimate booths surround by what I refer to as "card tables" and plaid backed chairs that remind me a little of 1960's kitsch poker.  Very cute.  Reminds me of my grandmother's basement and I mean this as a whole hearted compliment.  We are brought water.  My glass had a chip on the rim.  No big deal. It was replaced immediately with the right tone and amount of sincerity from our server.  I ordered the lobster roll.  No skimping on the good stuff.  It's mayonnaise based (not too much), hints of tarragon, red bell pepper and the snap of celery and the obligatory shredded lettuce.  Served on a "hot dog" styled bun.  Just the way it should be and as I remember from the east coast.  One suggestion.  The bun is a just a little too thick.    My friend ordered the ribs.  He was very happy.  The bones were spaced well.  Meaning, an abundance of meat. Pork ribs are sometimes dicey.  You're taking a risk ordering them because in the United States, there is no grading system for pork like there is for beef, ie, select, choice and prime.  I wish America would adopt the European pork grading system.  I digress.  These people obviously care about their suppliers and the quality.    I can't wait to come back and try more!  Keep it up, Windsor!

Mama Mia.  I hate giving this kind of review  to a place I hold dear.  Obviously operations haven't been ironed out in the front of the house or the back of the house.  I've been a fan and patron of Bianco since '06 when I was exiled here from San Francisco and Chicago.  I was living part time in both cities.  I got to know thin and deep dish crust pizzas.  I prefer thin. Unless it's Giordano's.  I digress.  I came with my uncle. Assuring him it was awesome pizza even thin crusted.    We ordered two mozzarella salads.  Good.  As I have always expected.  We arrived at 7pm.  Salads at 715.  Pizza, the "wise guy" fired at 727.  Didn't receive the pizza until 810.    My uncle ordered iced tea.  He didn't receive a refill from our server.  He politely set his empty iced tea glass to the side.  And then we waited.    This awesome waiter assistant/back waiter filled his iced tea.    Then our server came by.  Asking if we wanted any crushed pepper for our pizza and if we were excited.  :/. What?!  Obviously!  We had been waiting and she didn't even acknowledge our wait let alone fill one iced tea.  Then I had to call anyone who would make eye contact with us over to see exactly what was happening with the pizza we ordered.  Was it given to another table?  Was the temperature in the wood fire burning oven too low?  Why aren't we enjoying Chris Bianco's pizza yet?  She explained that the order is fired after salads are FINISHED on the table.  Be warned.  I wasn't.  Lord almighty.  Back of house and front of house has some work to be done.  Fire entrees when salads arrive.  Not after one finishes their salad.  I was given this explanation.  "The oven is backed up right now."  This came from the hostess I had to wave at.  Understand, it's very horrible and rude to have to wave at any restaurant staff.  They are thinking a million things a second if they really care about their job.    Our waitress was lackluster at best.  She ignored us.  She was either embarassed the kitchen is going through changes( and going down) with new blood or she just really doesn't know how to talk to a table regarding a long time ticket.    Very disappointed.  I'll take out from now on after calling ahead.

I love you guys.  You make my heart and stomach so happy.  That being said, this place really cares about who is walking in, sitting down and dining.  I only eat at the bar.  The reason?  I'll tell you why.  I always meet someone interesting.  I always make a friend.  I always find something new menu item from my friends at the bar.    Pssst.  If you like foie, get your ass over here.  It's not a sin.  They do it right.  Don't believe all that PETA propaganda either.    Tostadas.  Man.  I could live inside that little cocoon of shredded pork for the rest of my life.    Salmon.  Damn.  They do it right.  Smoked, white pickles onions on top of a mashed potato pancake sprinkled in Panko breadcrumbs.  I love you guys.  You make me weep.  I'm yours forever.
