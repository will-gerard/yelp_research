Long wait...  When I have to wait 40 minutes for a bento box, something is seriously gone wrong. Food is pretty pedestrian, location is a plus.

This place is fantastic. Coffee drinks are good average, baked goods are absolutely fantastic. Scratch baking at its very best!

Spectacular! Best Korean food in the valley. Stop by and eat at this little culinary gem. Authentic fare, reasonable prices. The kimchee soup is a must have!

Very good food, large portions and nice atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.  Definitely returning.  Recently tried deliver and it was super fast, well within 15 minutes.

I used to really enjoy this place. However, the service has really gone down. My pedicure was nothing short of painful. The massage was non-existent, and she didn't even do callus removal even though I paid for it. Won't go back.

I had the vegetable pho. Vibrant broth, fresh veggies but a tad light on noodles. Service was prompt and didn't hover about. I would return.

When you have to stop the waiter and ask for a glass of water, you know the meal is not going to go well.  The food was uninspired: under-seasoned, underwhelming. The only saving grace of the meal was the guacamole, but even that lacked even a scintilla of uniqueness.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but especially as slow as the restaurant was I expected far better service.   Barrio Urbano was half the meal I expected at twice the price. I love the Yard, but I will not return to this disappointing experience.
