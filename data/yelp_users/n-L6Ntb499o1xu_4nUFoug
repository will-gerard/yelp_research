I needed 2 tires and a wheel replaced on my 2012 nissan car.  I talked to one of the sales managers and wanted to make sure that when I ordered a new non refundable oem hubcap it would fit. I was assured it would.  I get my shipment of oem caps and they did not fit.  Discount Tire could have fitted their replacement wheel with the oem caps I already had but they just wanted to make the sale. Now I have to spend more time to shop for another wheel that will fit and get it replaced.  Very poor customer service in guaranteeing service when they could have easily tested the resolution and given me a solid answer to cap compatibility.  They were just worried about making their sale.  I'm Very dissatisfied. I know many people that shop here but I will make sure they take their business elsewhere.

I really like that a restaurant like this is finally in the Ahwatukee area.  I ordered the carne asada torta and the #15 chimichanga meal.  Both were a great choice.  The side of rice and beans were mediocre for Mexican food.  But overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good flavor and is easy on your budget.  The kitchen and dining areas also looked very clean.
