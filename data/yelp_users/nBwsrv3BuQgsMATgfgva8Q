If you have a sweet tooth and are going for a tasty brunch option just... go home (or go to Denny's). I'm not sure if First Watch knows what ricotta even is because the "lemon ricotta" pancakes I ordered came out with what appeared to be yellow frosting and artificial flavoring sans ricotta that was completely unappetizing. The pancakes were also very dry. Essentially what I got was a poorly made, single-layer, dry bread circle with dollar store-grade frosting. I totally get that their thing is healthy food, so why not stick to what you know best? You can't have a "healthy" lemon ricotta pancake- that's like trying to create a healthy doughnut.   The Nutella French toast was also on a ciabatta bun? Yes, you read that correctly.   I saw someone else write a review about the biscuits and gravy, which is what my friend ordered. I could not agree more, the gravy was watery and tasted more like Salisbury steak gravy than the traditional buttermilk gravy. I'd also like to point out the false advertising in "biscuits" because these were a deformed English muffin/hamburger bun combination that tasted nowhere near like a biscuit. Please don't waste your money.  Word from the wise- just play it safe and order eggs with bacon. You can't mess that up... right?

Extremely friendly service and delicious guac! Great for groups or just hanging with close friends. The close proximity to other bars/clubs makes it a great central location
