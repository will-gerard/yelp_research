I spend hours in SAS every month. The selection is crazy, you have to really look through things, because this is not a traditional; fabric/craft store. It's an overrun and slightly damaged store. So if you go in knowing this, take your time and look through what you are getting, you can get some amazing deals. I made 6 maxi skirts for my daughter for about $12. This is also a quilters dream paradise. tables full of quilting fabrics in small sections so you can pick up some great pieces.

One of the first things we did when my daughter got engaged was to make sure that Ray the Dj was available for our wedding date! And we are so glad that we booked early! What a great time! Our DJ,Jeremy played just the right combination of Country for our country loving fans and enough pop to keep the party hopping til the last song was played. Always one of the first companies that I refer to my clients who are looking for a DJ, they are still at the top of my list. Easy to work with, affordable and they really take into account what music you like!

The best feeling in the world is when the guests from your daughters wedding keep coming up to tell you that the meal was the best they had EVER had at a wedding. We had an amazing duet of carved roast beef with Aujus and a Chicken with Mushroom sauce that was to-die-for! Every plate came out the right temperature, was beautifully plated and presented by a superb staff that really took care of everything so we didn't need to worry about anything. And the cake was absolutely perfect! The gorgeous and delicious 10 tier chocolate torte was heavenly and the dessert station selection was incomparable! This should be one of your first calls!

Wow, what a terrible experience! The shrimp scampi was so acidic that it burned the inside of my mouth and tasted like mostly lemon. It was inedible. We had to wait over 20 minutes before we were even offered or brought a glass of water let alone any other beverages. The service was terrible and the server kept saying that the tip wasn't included so not to forget to tip the waiters. How Rude! A tip is for good service and we didn't have that! It was so noisy inside that we could barely talk to one another and were nearly yelling to be heard by each other. Even after we complained about the bad food and the service nothing was done. They will never get my business again.

We are huge Pasty fans and go to the Guadalupe Road location at least once a month. This past weekend we used them for catering. We picked up 60 assorted Pasties and warmed them up on location for 15 minutes and Voila! just as good as at the restaurant! It was a huge hit at my daughter's rehearsal dinner. I highly recommend them!

I have worked with Jeanne on Multiple events and every one goes off without a hitch! I actually get thanks from some of my clients that I have recommended her too. Her planning skills are a good investment!
