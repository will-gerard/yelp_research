Don't let the sketch-filled parking lot fool you! I know, there's Los Burritos a few doors down and  Kim's Chinese Food and a Cristiana Libreria.... Random oozes out of that strip mall. But Bacchanal is great. I had a Google Offer for the place and luckily live pretty close so made the trip last night. The decor is definitely dated (i.e. glass block walls, shitty chairs)- but you can tell they tried. They tried to create a gem in an otherwise downtrodden area. The food was surprisingly good.   We started with the appetizer platter- a sampling of deliciousness. I would have never thought to get cheese at a Greek place, but this cheese was so fresh. It was perfect with the fresh pita triangles served with it.   I had high hopes as I am a fiend for tzatziki sauce and the gyro platter I got was to die for. So good. I can't emphasize enough. So good. I want to eat gyros every day now. It's a weird hankering to have, but alas, it is what it is. My date had a lamb stew with veggies, potatoes and rice- Also very good. The portions are perfect for the price (gyro platter $10, lamb entree plate $16).   They also have Greek wines and Greek beers available- And there's a sign right outside the door that had words concerning my favorite hours of the day (you know, those happy ones)- half off appetizers and discounted beers. Both great things in my book.   I plan on returning. Feel free to join me. We can learn how to bellydance our bellies full of lamb together.

If you're going for happy hour, get there on the earlier side of the time frame... The bar fills up quickly and you can only get the specials at the bar. I have to say that this is one of my new favorite HH spots! I went on a Tuesday night and they have half off bottles of wine, all night. Good thing since I needed something to wash down the delectable bacon wrapped scallops.   The small plates deals during HH are great and such a great departure from the usual HH bites... I don't know about you but I'm tired of fried things and bruschetta. How much bruschetta can Phoenix handle?! Yet, I digress. The small plates, from $9 to $5 a plate... such a good deal. We had the scallops I mentioned, really good scallops- worth the regular price of $9. We also had the Beef Tenderloin/Brie toasts, a little heavy on the brie, but the barkeep raved that they were the best thing he's ever had... (Maybe he should try Postino's toast?) Stuffed mushrooms were good, the taco combo plate- Great Mexico City style tacos, and I'm a huge critic of Mexican food and these were actually very good. Except 1, 1 was a wee bit too spicy for me. And I LOVE spicy. Maybe it was the wine bringing out the tingling on my tongue? We also got the oysters rokerij, similar to Green Mussels you would get at a sushi place... Very yummy.   There were 3 in our party and we walked out of the place full and pleasantly toasty for $60 total- this isn't your Chili's HH but I'm more than willing to spend $20 for the atmosphere, the drink, and the food. We will definitely be back.

Fantastic bar! Dive-ish bar, patio type area, Wednesday is Poetry night .... Weekends live music.... poetry isn't really my scene and the live music is kind of loud..... but that's what the patio is for!   Great beer selection!   What I love about this place is the extensive beer selection!! Dogfish head that I've never heard of!   AND you can drink your delicious beers (or cocktails) while watching live hockey games/hockey practice.   I'm not big into ice skating but this is super fun. AND it feels like a secret bar... which I guess my review isn't going to help.

The service was great! Our server was the right amount of attentive and helpful.   We ordered the sizzling rice soup, pretty good- and the large is enough for probably 4 people to share.   Walnut Shrimp = Mayo shrimp ... For those of you reading this that have not tried this amazing Chinese/American psuedo dish, it is one of my favorites. I am a HUGE fan of authentic food from all ethnicities, but every now and then I like to fall back on something like this. My grandma might not have eaten this in China but it is damn good regardless. But I digress- Try it. You like it.   We also got the barbecue pork with veggies. I like snow peas and there were also baby carrots, bean sprouts, and carrots. I thought it was great.   If you like spicy- ask for the chili oil. I like it on everything.   To address some of the reviews that made reference to it being expensive. I don't know where Chinese food go the reputation of being cheap. Maybe it was from all the buffets scattered throughout the state. But Chinese food isn't 'that' cheap when going to a decent sit down type place. Our tab was about $35 for 2 people. This included 1 beer and we had leftovers.

Big variety! They even have creosote bushes. If you have lived in Phoenix and had the privilege of knowing what it smells like after a good rain in the desert, you will appreciate this. The smell that is so unique to Phoenix rain is from the creosote bushes. It's incredible. I love it. I love it. I love the smell so much that I bought 2 bushes and have planted them at my home... Eagerly awaiting the next rain.   The staff at Baker's are great. Very helpful and pleasant. You get the feeling that the employees love working there.   GIFTS! They have pots, vases, lawn decorations, and of course plants. I recommend supporting our local nursery (and not the Big Orange box down the street from them) and giving the gift of life (I know cheesey, but plants are living!) for birthdays, Christmas, Kwanzaa, Easter, etc.

2nd year in a row that I have come for pumpkin-ing! The pumpkins are expensive and there's a lot of dust, but all that gets forgotten watching the pig races! It's a fun way to spend an afternoon. Great for families and for groups of friends.   If you go- Wear bug repellant (the corn maze will leave you nursing bites for days) Have a couple glasses of wine (and maybe lunch too if burgers and hot dogs aren't your thing) at queen creek olive oil mill first :)

I used to be hater.   I admit it. The skinny jean wearing, mac using vibe used to irk me in ways that I thought only a mosquito could. I would drop in, get every drink to-go and get the heck out of there as quickly as possible. Loud music, fauxhawks, etc...   SIGH.   Oh Lux. You're new space is sublime. There is enough space where I can find a cozy corner, turn on my work laptop, drink coffee, have the 2 egg breakfast with tomato and veggie hash (I opt for the tomatoes instead of bacon. AND. I love bacon, so i think that's saying something about how stinkin' good those tomatoes are).... Where was I? Oh yes, have my work computer on... so Office Communicator is running... ;) ... and I can enjoy breakfast (which frequently turns into brunch) and read the paper, a magazine, a book, make travel plans, etc.   LOVE it.   Also for you futbol fans (that's soccer to you english speaking folks), they will happily play your Barcelona should-be champions, on the big screen in the back room- all you gotta do is ask.   ***Speakeasy bar area. The mixologist takes some serious time and consideration for each adult beverage I've ever had there or seen him make. Delicious bloody mary's, GREAT beer selection (New Beligum Cocoa Mole!), etc. etc. etc.   I feel that I can't run out of good things to say about this place. If you were a hater like I was, go back and try it again. You'll find the new vibe is much more welcoming... OR maybe I've adapted :)

so we go to the vig for big azz $5 burger night. we show up all mad men amped and ordered 2 glenlevits. i take 2 drinks out of my beverage and notice a fly floating like a dead fish. i let the waitress know, she seemed concerned and brought me a comprable scotch since they were out of glenlevit. im not picky, i promise. i didnt like it, but i drank it. as soon as my friends ice melted in his drink, he noticed 2 floating friends in his. he showed the server his glass, who had a face of dsibelief, as if it was impossible that 2 people drinking the same scotch could both have dead flies in it. so he tried mine, didnt like. asked her to bring him something else. we finish our drinks and his vigazz burger, and get the check. loanbehold the check shows 1 scotch, 1 scoth that was $5 more than the other and a comment about how we didnt mention $5 burger night... even though the menu clearly states it. my friend doenst mind paying $ for good scotch. he does mind when he gets a replacemtn scotch that costs $5 more. flies happen on accident, but bad service doesnt.

I was super excited to think that I would be able to get my clothes dry cleaned in a 'green' way... However that all changed when the cleaners lost my clothes for over a week. I had dropped them off and went to pick them up a day or 2 after they were meant to be ready and lo and behold, they were missing! Not to mention the annoyance of the occurence, but the fact that there was a new cashmere cardigan, Banana dress pants, etc, upset me quite a bit. The woman who informed me of my missing clothes said to call back the next day. So I called back and the woman said that she believed another customer had taken my clothes by mistake. Ok, I thought. Not a big deal. However the clothes were not returned or found (I never found out what exactly had happened caused the disapperance) for over another week! I went to the facility to pick up my found garments and expected to be comp'd the services (or at least offered a discount). Nothing was offered. I refused to pay the total amount due to the stress it had caused me (the clothes were meant for a business trip). I ended up paying half. The woman did not seem to understand the value of customer service or loyalty. I plan on looking elsewhere for 'green' dry cleaning services.

Another great HH gem!   Daily 3-6pm.  Half off all glasses of wine! :) Woohooo! AND they have GREAT cocktails with fresh squeezed juices that are only $5.   I recommend the burger, the pork chili, and the fingerling potatoes  If the weather permits, sit outside! You'll forget you're in Central Phoenix.

Carne Asada torta = mmmmmmmm! So yummy! I saw someone's review that says the tortas come with Ruffles, yes, they do... And it totally makes the sandwich. I think the balance is awesome with crunchy, spicy, etc.   Make sure you get everything on it, if you don't, don't bother going. Also, ask for jalepenos and spicy carrots.   The tacos are Mexico City style, small tortillas and carne asada, tripe, tongue, pastor, etc. So good. I went to Mexico City in May 2010 and this is as close to the real thing that I can find in Phoenix.   I also love that the owners are sometimes the cooks!

I feel like I'm in Plaza Mayor in Madrid, or a cafe in Paris. This has such a modern European cafe feel to it. I love it. I love the homemade pastries, mousses, and everything else. I've had the chocolate eclair- Which I wanted to LOVE but sadly the icing on top is a tad too sweet. But scrap some of that off and it's perfect. The iced coffee ( I like to bastardize my coffee with cream) is delicious. The large is MUY grande. Expect your thirst to be quenched. The Irish Cream mousse is tre bien. It's a little pricey, but worth it.

The food is great and so is the grassy knoll! When we went the facility was undergoing some renovation so there was no big drums of olive oil to stare at. But never fear, they made up for it by having an 'Italian' Oktoberfest. 5 FREE tastings of wine/beer and the option to purchase tasting tickets for more. I am still basking in the glow from last Saturday... Lobster bisque and wine.   Don't forget to pick up Christmas and Birthday gifts while there, it is very far from Phoenix proper.

I am only giving 1 star due to the terrible service. There is one woman that works there in particular that is very unpleasant. No smiles. I had a return, within the given # of days, but she almost seemed personally offedned that I was returning it and was very short throughout the transaction...   I love the merchandise and have purchased some great mosaic tile pots. I like the eclectic mix of items and will go back but will not expect good customer service.

One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix just so happened to have a great Groupon deal, so other than wanting to go, I could now go and save some $s too. After a long week of work, more specifically a 13 hour day, I had high expectations.   It wasn't a terrible dinner but to me, loving my cocktail more than both entrees is a bit of a letdown. Maybe its my fault for wanting to try things on the menu I wouldn't normally try? Regardless, a meal that would have cost us $125 without the groupon, is a meal that I expect to be wowed by.   Crab and avocado foam salad- it was like a fancy seafood salad. Something about the texture just wasn't doing it for me. It reminded me of something you would buy at the deli counter at Fry's. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth $15 either.   The wild striped bass was actually delicious- on top of yummy, cheesy rissotto. The bass was crisped on the edges but great flavor. I do think it was a tad over cooked but completely bearable. But the sides... Normally I'm a big fan of broccolini but this broccolini was terrible. Bitter to the point of being inedible. And there were 4 sad strips of skinny green beans that did absolutely nothing for the dish.   The house-made linguine... The pasta alone with some butter would have been a better dish than the sherry vinegar sauce it came in. I get the idea of the dish, some people like sour noodles, and might get off from the pretentiousness of it. I guess it just wasn't for me.   The star of the evening:  noca Royale $14 Schramsberg "Blanc de Blancs" Seasonal Fruit, St. Germain Liqueur The best cocktail I have ever had. I'm always a fan of bevy's with St. Germain Elderflower Liquer- it always adds such a great flavor to drinks. But this drink... Oh man. The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree. I would go back to Noca and just throw back a couple of these and munch on the cotton candy and chocolate chip short bread they give you, for free, at the end.

This review is long overdue. I have been to Christopher's a handful of times and each time there has been something that has made me question the snotty behavior of our servers. Just because my friends and I are on the younger side of the Christopher's crowd (read: under 50) and frequent the place for happy hour, does not mean we are trash or deserve to be treated as such. The following is a sampling of true stories that I have encountered.   Scenario 1: 2 of our party of 4 waited at the kitchen bar for 10 minutes after being seated without being acknowledged. No "I'll be right with you" or any greeting at all. The waiter saunters over and asks if they would like something to drink. How are they supposed to know what they want to drink? They had to ask him for a wine menu and for that matter a dinner menu as well. 10 minutes of sitting, wondering who their server is, wondering when they would get a menu.... too much wondering.   Scenario 2: The kitchen bar was full during happy hour so they reluctantly obliged to letting us sit at a high top right by the kitchen bar for happy hour since happy hour is only supposed to be at the kitchen bar and the Crush lounge area. We order our first round of wines and the waiter knocks over a glass of red wine all over one of the girls in our group. LUCKILY she was wearing a dark top anyways but the waiter didn't even apologize. I quote, "Obviously I didn't mean for that to happen". That was it. He didn't even help clean it up, he had the busser come over to help her pat down. I understand accidents happen, but apologize for it. Just don't be rude about it. If he would have apologized we would all have a better perception of the place but even beyond that incident, he was short and rude with us the entire time we were there.   Scenario 3: This scenario is hard to explain via Yelp review, so please forgive me if it seems blunt/rude/etc. I will be using terms like Asian and White a lot but none of it is meant to be offensive. My friend and I, and another table of Asians, were the only non-white tables at the restaurant. I'm not one to judge based on race, but it just so happened to be something I noticed. I overheard a white table ask the server how the ahi tuna was. The server then told the man asking 'Oh that Chinese guy over there ate it and finished his plate'. .... Ummmm what is that supposed to mean? I don't understand the significance of an Asian guy eating the tuna and how that is supposed to make it sound good or make it sound desirable for the other patron of the restaurant. He could have just said 'that guy over there' if he was trying to say other people have ordered it and enjoyed it. His ethnicity had nothing to do with it.   So why do I keep going back you might wonder? Well. Their happy hour is amazing. The food and drink specials mean that we go there expecting rude service, we typically get rude service, but we are able to have a nice dinner, a couple glasses of wine, all for about $20 a person. I will probably go back. I love the wines, the fries, the pizzas, the cheeseburger, and the filet of salmon salad (basically the whole hh menu). Depending on the service the next time I'm there, I plan on telling Christopher myself. He is usually there but I'm not sure how he would react.

FANTASTIC Happy Hour (HH).  Affordable. Delicious. And a great selection.   The steak tartare with quail egg is my go to pick.   Great view of Camelback mountain if you sit on the patio... Though with the upcoming summer months, that sounds pretty miserable. Nevertheless, the bar area is great. Huge chairs and a classy, laid back vibe.   Service tends to be pretty slow. I've been a handful of times for HH and it seems like there's only 1 server scheduled to handle the HH crowd. When you sit down, quickly look at the menu and order your drink when the server comes by... Otherwise you might be waiting a bit for your drinks and nibbles.   The wait is worth it !

I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews on Flores here on Yelp. I have used Flores twice in the past year- Once to check out why the heater wasn't working and the other for A/C repair.   The service technician was honest, prompt, and affordable.   The unit I have is very old, but not yet in need of replacement. Flores could have made $$$ off me by recommending me to buy a new unit when I first called about the heater not working, but the tech recommended that I wait till the whole unit dies and use space heaters in the meantime. Which I am a-okay with! I understand that it might seem like they just want me to be dependent on regular maintenance or service but that hasn't been the case. I've only had my a/c actually repaired once. And it cost about $150 and took less than an hour. I'd definitely rather pay that every few years than $4k for a new unit.   I'm glad I finally have a 'guy'. Lots of people have a plumbing guy, an electrical guy, etc. Now I have an a/c guy! I will definitely keep their contact info for future use!

I have been a fan of Lola's since they opened and since Lola's tapas closed. The coffee is delicious. The ambiance superb. I am not a fan of the Lux coffee shops of the world (no offense). But when I feel that I need a white Mac to fit in, it's just not my scene. The music varies with which barista is working but always eclectic and fun. It may sound weird... but try an iced peach latte with whip next time you stop in. It's delicious!

I like many of the others got a groupon to try this place. I WISH i would have got the 10 session groupon but i got the 5 session. I've been to 2 sessions thus far and am seeing results already! the 30 minutes goes by so fast and was only initimidating the first time as I was brand new to boxing. My trainer is great and I know he sees the pain in my eyes but keeps pushing without being a punk.   The sessions are normally $20 each, and they recommend 2x a week. After my groupon is over, I plan on going once a week. A friend of mine is a personal trainer and charges $25 so $20 is pretty reasonable.   I recommend running by the canal as a warm up and REMEMBER to stretch before and after!! I wish I would have stretched more after my last session... It would make normal bodily movements easier.

We go at least once a week, and have, in the past gone twice in 1 day. It used to be a different Pho place which was also good, this place "insert cliche for amazing here". The freshness of all the herbs and veggies, the out of this world level of umptuous savory goodness... Simply put, it's a great place. And super easy on the wallet too. It was, at one time, filled with only Vietnamese people. We would be the only ones in the restaurant of another ethnicity- side note, when going to an 'ethnic' restaurant, its usually a good sign to see people from that region as patrons.   Somehow the secret has escaped and it is quite multicultural now. It's refreshing to see Hispanic, Caucasians, and Vietnamese all rubbing elbows while inhaling a hot bowl of Pho!   I feel as the pictures should speak for themselves...   Here's the info... But don't overrun the place. We don't like going and not having somewhere to sit!  Google recognizes it as:  Pho Bang Restaurant  Ste 14, 1702 West Camelback Road  Phoenix  1 (602) 242-1979   LOVE IT! Very authentic and so amazing.

I would give zero stars if I could. I have never felt so betrayed by a server or a bartender in all of my dining and drinking experiences. I'm not one to normally complain to a manager about anything. If the service sucks, I don't tip. If the food tastes bad, I blame it on the establishment- not the specific server. Tonight was different. A few friends and I stopped in to have a few drinks. We sat at the bar and our first round went swimmingly well. The next round, not so much. I ordered the 'shroom collins' and proceeded to watch the bartender finish what was left of the bottle of tanq. She then pulled out a bottle of well gin to add to the drink. I'm not against drinking well. At all. I'm a huge fan of well happy hours, not against it. But when I'm paying 9.50 for a cocktail, I expect the liquor that is specified on the menu. I received my beverage and asked the bartender if they ran out of tanq. She said no. that she added triple sec.  Because it was special, for me. Nowhere on the drink menu was triple sec mentioned for the aforementioned drink. I asked her again, and said are you sure? I thought I saw you finish that bottle and pull out another one. She said no. that it was all tanq. She then offered to remake it for me; I said no, that I'll see how it tastes. So I debated with my group if I should say anything or not. Everyone agreed that I should ask to see the bottle of gin and see if it looked anything like what I "thought" I saw. I asked the other bartender to see the bottle. As she walked over to the mini fridge to get the bottle, the other bartender stopped her and "explained the situation". The bartender came over and told me the name of the gin. What does the name mean when I asked to see the bottle? I asked again and they wouldn't show it to me. So we got the check, I told them I wasn't paying for it, and I didn't. I spoke to the manager about it who did nothing...im thinking it may have been a busboy or a high college kid from asu west, either way he said to ask for him next time and he would get me a free drink "or something". Not sure what that means... either way, I don't like being lied to. Again, I order and pay for quality drinks. If someone has to make amendments to that drink, that's fine. Just don't lie about it. I will not be going back.

It's a little pricey for uncooked pasta, but it is delicious and I feel worth every penny! (or dollar in this case) My boyfriend makes an excellent carbonara from a Batali book and the tagliatelli they have at Pasta and Sugo is the perfect combination. we have also had the ravioli which is very good and easy to prepare. Make sure you take heed of the time listed- they are not open very many hours and the hours that they are open are not very convenient.

I've been missing Lola's Tapas for about a year now and have been in search of  a new Tapas place. Tapas Papas Fritas is good, but more formal than Iruna. Iruna felt more casual while still being trendy and nice inside. The sangria was muy yummy. I recommend signing up for their e-mail list, better yet- I recommend signing up for ALL email lists (you almost will always be rewarded with something gratis). Anywho, I recommend Happy Hour to dip your feet in the water. You like, go back for dinner!   What I ordered (and will most likely order the next time I go back): Serrano and Manchego- so simple, yet so yummy Artichokes and Clams in white sauce- this was an interesting choice for us, but I was very pleased. the white sauce wasn't overpowering as it sometimes is Pollo Colonial- a fantastic alternative to wings- don't get confused. They are nothing like regular wings, but do use chicken wing meat in a great aioli type sauce  Patatas Bravas- papas weren't dry or overcooked. The sauce was interesting, it was like an explosion of pimenton, but i like pimenton so it worked.

Delicioso! I've travelled to Spain a few times and these tapas are by far the best tapas I've had outside of Espana. The food was great, the service was the perfect amount (not too much and not too little) and the ambiance was great! A few of the favorites from our party of 4's meals... Squid ink tapa, crab meat filled peppers, blue cheese steak, seafood bowl, rabbit, ox tail, and the flan! The best flan any of us had ever had.

We went there for AZ Restaurant week. AND fyi, there was no special deal for Restaurant week. We quickly added up how much each entree would be regularly and surprise surprise we should have taken advantage of another restaurant that week.  Like a few other reviews, I was disappointed. One member of our group ordered a chicken dish with lentils that was good, she also ordered a fantastic roasted beet salad. I guess she got lucky...  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizer- WAY TOO SALTY. It wasn't good. I am a big fan of grilled cheese. But this was something where I didnt even want the leftovers.  2 others in our group got a green chili stew, it was okay.  The dessert got us excited- chocolate covered bacon s'mores. WHAAAT?!?! I know. Crazy talk. But at that point we had filled up on the free bread that was amazing and were quite full. The dream world dessert was good, not a reason to go back though.

I love this place!! The food  is great, the portions are huge, and it's affordable. I really hope people start frequenting this place soon otherwise I don't think they'll be able to maintain for much longer.   They have great roast pork... perfect amount of fat to meat to crispy skin.   Roast duck is bomb diggity.  And I  know it's cliche, but their sweet and sour pork is really good. They don't use those pork nugget things you get at Panda Express, it's actually pieces from a pork chop that they lightly batter and smother a delicious honey/bbq/sweet and sour sauce all over.  I highly recommend this place!

I loved this place! It was so refreshing to go somewhere in Old Town that wasn't pretentious, over-priced, or part of some 'scene'. I plan on going back over and over again.   What we drank: Moe'scow Mules (THEY USE FEVER TREEE ginger beer. *sigh* If you've never tried the Fever Tree line, go to Whole Foods or CPH for that matter and try it. SO yummy and makes all the difference.)   Nimbus Brown Ales. Good stuff. Nothing unique about having the beer, just great that they serve local beers that actually have some flavor.   What we ate:  AZBLT- $10 for the sandwich, but it was so good that I'd pay that again. Normally I'm against pricey sandwiches in general but for a late night snack with beverages, it pairs nicely.   Grilled Cheese- They do add ham to this guy but it's very yummy. Sometimes grilled cheeses seem to be a bit salty when you get them at restaurants, but this one was great.   Scallops- There were about 4-5 scallops and they came with some corn grits. The scallops were perfectly cooked and flavored, and corn grits are awesome! Corn just so happens to be my favorite veggie and this was a pleasant surprise to have them with scallops.   Crispy Rock Shrimp- Very good, but don't put the roasted lemon on it. Just use the sauce it comes with. The roasted lemon leaves an odd flavor and I think it's better without.   Curried Mussles- SOOO Good. I was so surprised that a 'American' pub type place would do a good curry. But they did. I was so overprotective of the juice even after the mussels were gone. We requested bread so we could sop it all up. Personally, I think it's good enough to move from the appetizer menu to the entrees, add a little rice, and you would be good to go.   It was great food, and for a decent price.

FANTASTIC HH.   $5 oak barrel aged cocktails (negronis and manhattans are usuals) 1/2 off ALL bar bites 1/2 off beer 1/2 off ALL glasses of wine  DAILY 3-6  I cannot believe I just discovered their HH. Service NEVER wavers here. I love it. I know exactly what to expect and yet everytime I leave I feel a renewed sense of appreciation for CPH and everything they do there. Service at the bar is great!   Is it HH yet? !

I have been to Windsor twice now, once for happy hour/dinner and once for brunch. They were voted best Gastropub in central phoenix... I don't think there's is much gastro or pub deserving qualities. The food is eh. We had the nachos (there listed under a fancier name on the menu) and those were actually very good. The salmon entree I got with the kale salad... not so much. Salmon was overcooked and the kale salad was well, a salad- not deserving of the rave reviews our server gave it. My comrade got the white fish banh mih... Now I am a HUGE fan of Vietnamese food and even futile fusion attempts by 'American' restaurants... Don't call it a banh mih if you're not going to serve it on a demi-french baguette. It was served on the same bun they serve their burgers on... So what you end up getting is a very SOFT sandwich. eh.  The drinks are good though. I would go for happy hour (even though it ends early- 5pm). $9 cocktail for $5 is a steal and they do execute that well.

Super yummy!! I got a caramel latte (I asked for it to be just a little sweet and the barista did a fantastic job of just the perfect amount of caramel for my early morning sweet tooth!). My counterpart got a cappuccino. We were both very happy with our coffee. The place is cute and modern without feeling like your in a Mac commercial the way you do when you're at Lux (I prefer Lola's but now live closer to Arcadia and I know Carmel's will be my new hangout).   We got a blueberry muffin that was delicious! There were real whole blueberries in it. The 2 other tables of patrons also raved about their pastries/breakfast items to the employees- which resulted in a visit from the baker. I love meeting the people who make my nourishments! Though I didn't talk to her much, she seemed very nice and was very sweet.

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!   I love it. And kinda wish I never found it! The ice cream sandwiches are to die for! The kitchen sink cookies are a spin off of what some might recognize as 'compost' cookies... basically the remenants of what a baker would typically have in their cabinet. Sometimes that will include chocolate chips, coffee grinds, pretzels, chips, butterscotch, nuts, etc. (on a side note, Momofuku in New York is the MAN when it comes to executing this to perfection). . . BUT I must say Churn does a great job on these cookies and everything else I have had there. I am a fan of the ice cream sandwiches with said cookie and madagascar vanillla and vietnamese coffee smooshed in between.   I love it. And I will continue to piss off my diet by coming back.

I bought a Google Offer for this place, and I'm so glad I did- The classes are SO fun... Even Zumba. Which makes me twitch. I am the opposite of rhythmically skilled. But the classes here are fun, easy, and a great work out too!   I tried 1 of the cycling classes.... Request the 'naughty' playlist. Cycling to Luda and Peaches never felt so good ;)

Alright. I feel that my first review was a bit unfair. I went back last weekend for a coffee and a donut.. and I must say, the donut was pretty good. I think the first time I went I was a bad donut picker.   I plan on returning!

So you like FnB? You like small, homegrown, local loving establishments? Lucky for you, Baratin is right up your alley. I had the pleasure of going in and guess who prepared my food? The lovely Charleen of course. How refreshing is it to be able to see this local chef (who's buddies with Gabrielle Hamilton of Prune NY.... sigh...) at the counter, assembling my pulverized jidori chicken liver plate! We also had a lamb sandwich with an amazing feta tzatziki sauce on it- oh yes, and for our 3rd dish (there were 2 of us, and 3 dishes was plenty)- we had cous cous with McClendon's carrots... SOO yummy. There were currants mixed in and probably a little curry powder. So good.   They had lots of local wines and 1 cocktail on the menu (a Vespar, affordably priced at $7).   The shop next door is awesome. We bought a few donuts and mesquite chocolate cookies for breakfast the next day... They have Queen Creek Extra Virgin Olive Oil in a huge vat, where you can fill up your own container for an affordable .50 an oz (I think that was the price, whatever the price was, it was affordable).   I highly recommend dropping by. I plan on returning many times.

Amazing wine selection with many Kermit Lynch imports making appearances. I love having a glass here, some snacks, and picking up bottles to go. This is a rare spot in the valley that will make you feel like you're in a much bigger city.
