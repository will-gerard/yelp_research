As a family we frequent this restaurant quite often since it opened....many many years ago IT IS AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD.  We luv it and when asked what is our favorite mexican restaurant to refer people there.  Mind you it is not fancy at all. Some of the original servers are still working there and they recognize the kids who are now 26 years old. Luv the personal service and the food is amazing.

Racial Profiling at its finest.....I've been there a couple of times because the clothes are nice.  But every time I go in the staff stares at me and follows me around the store they are NOT friendly.    I guess they have not seen the the movies Pretty Woman or Selena.....they should and maybe they will learn a thing or two about ppl with money....$$$$....by the way I'm hispanic.

Actually a NO STAR... Ordered more beads for my lip piercing in different colors, this is my 2nd order and I should of learned from the 1st order.  This order was place in October (paid in advance), just got call today that the order has come in.   Customer service sucks, but as mentioned I should of learned with the 1st order which they said they called, but on my cel phone you can leave a message...duh....  Shame on me tho. I'm only one person, they have lost MY business!!!

I luv this place so much I'm there 4 to 5 times a week.  TRX challenging and pilates is a good mix to throw into the week.  Kelly, Amanda and Eddie are really good at what they do.

Excellent food and wine, atmosphere OK, the downer was that we went on a Saturday night and we were sweating the complete time....I even had to put my hair up in a make shift bun.  Extremely uncomfortable.

Amani at the Waterfront location is the best, she is everything you expect from a hairdresser, cute, always dressed well and her hair and makeup immaculate!!!  I have actually booked her every Friday for the next 2 months;)

Sitting in lobby, receptionist talking down to patients, rolling her eyes and chomping on gum.... This should be an exceptional business medical environment.   Three women sitting at front desk the one with red hair, can't get close enough to see if she's wearing a name plate.   At the very least she should smile;)

FAULTY EQUIPMENT: The aux cord to your phone that are in the beds have been out for over a month.  Therefore, you can't listen to your own music..  They do not hesitate to charge you the complete and full amount every month....but they DO NOT REPAIR the equipment on a timely manner, which gives the impression that you are not getting your moneys worth!

Was so anxious to have a meal there, place looks ok lots of ppl in kitchen, bar looks great the super large tv's are impressive.    Ordered the tempura cod tacos...what a disappointment, they were just OK and way too small.  Had a passion fruit drink...again just OK.  This was Sunday and it was not packed but we still had to wave the server down for a 2nd bellini.  I probably  won't go there again there are too many better places to go spend my money at.
