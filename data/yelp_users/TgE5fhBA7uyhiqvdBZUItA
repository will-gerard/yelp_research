I have been taking both of my cats here for the last five months. That may not sound like a lot, but in that time one has had 8 teeth pulled and the other has suffered from gastrointestinal issues (he is 16) and each time I go to VCA McCormick, the staff treats my fur-babies like one of their own. Dr. M is incredibly understanding, I called her countless times when I didn't understand my senior kitty's test results, or when I was scared because he was sneezing more than usual. Unlike some other veterinarians I've seen, the staff at VCA McCormick has never once made me feel guilty for not having a lot of money, and they have given me discounts where they were able to to make sure my babes get the care they deserve on my less than ideal budget. When I called for an emergency visit, they got me in that day. Yes, they are more expensive than most vets, but you get a million dollar experience. So thank you Dr. M and all the ladies that are there for me when me and the family need them most!

When my 16 year old cat needed an abdominal ultrasound, I was depressed for days because I didn't know when I would be able to afford to get him one. After calling around at a few animal hospitals, I finally found an ultrasound I could afford at Horizon. The woman on the phone (Sonya) was so kind and patient with me and the rest of the staff are pleasant as well. I also appreciate that when a particular "barky" dog comes in, they put them in the room right away so the rest of the patients aren't disturbed. Horizon has unbeatable prices, especially considering their competence and professionalism. The only complaint I have is that one of the vet techs poked at my kitty through his mesh carrier. I know it was meant to be friendly, but you really shouldn't put your finger in an animal's face, especially if he doesn't know you.

I come to The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf several times a week to study, and I'll tell you why: there are plenty of outlets available for everyone and the drinks are delicious. That being said, I personally enjoy my drinks on the sweeter side, so the other reviewers complaining about sweetness are probably on to something, it's just simply not a problem to moi. I also appreciate that CB&TL is very bright-the abundance of glass walls ensures that lots of natural sunlight comes in which makes reading a whole lot easier. Honestly, the drink quality and the brightness are why I come here to study as opposed to the Starbucks on Indian Bend and Shea. The downside of the Coffee Bean is that they offer very little in the way of food and the pastries that ARE available are pretty dry and bland. The service is hit or miss-it's never really bad per se, but some of the baristas are definitely warmer and more customer service oriented than others. The baristas who are friendly, though, seem to go above and beyond for their customers, which makes up for the one or two who are still struggling with the "customer service" concept.

Great little coffee place! The drinks are always spot-on and you can tell by the way they taste that they: A(use high quality beans, and B(Know how to pull a shot correctly. They also have tasty sandwiches-my personal favorite is the Caprese because the pesto sauce is awesome and you can't go wrong with mozzarella cheese. However, I did give 4 and not 5 stars because they used to serve their sandwiches on a baguette which I was always down for, but have recently switched to panini style. This would be fine (I mean, who am I to resist a great panini?) but the temperature of the mozzarella comes out in limbo between warm and cold and the contrast is a little...unpleasant. The ingredients are still of great quality though.  Also, I would not recommend Village Roastery for studying as they keep the lights pretty dim inside and there are not many outlets available to use a laptop. I've read other reviewers remark that it is too noisy, but honestly that has never been an issue for me, even while studying. If you are looking for a quick, gourmet lunch paired with a velvety, luxurious mocha, definitely stop by Village Coffee Roastery!

Buyer beware! My boyfriend, our two children, and I were supposed to stay in the two story casita for a staycation before school starts again. My opinion was soured right away when we went to check-in at 4pm, an hour past the usual 3pm check-in time at most hotels. The man at check in informed us that the room was not ready yet. I asked him if he could give me a ballpark time of how long the wait would be. He seemed bothered to find out, but called housekeeping and simply told me "soon". AN HOUR LATER we finally got keys to the casita. Scattered about the grounds was random trash, wrappers, and cigarette butts. Then we went in side. Let me just start by saying that casita was described on the website as "Spanish-Mediterranean" decor. Ha! The decor was better described as "ghetto" in my opinion. The first thing my boyfriend noticed was that the refridgerator was being held up by a block of wood. We thought this was strange, until we actually tried opening it and it wobbled. A lot. The refridgerator wasn't a big deal to me; we were there to spend time as a family and use the multiple pools anyway. But then I sat on the couch and the cushions were very wet. And stained. As were the drapes. And the fraying chairs sitting at the breakfast bar (crusty white stains specifically). And if the wet, stained chairs weren't enough, there were flys EVERYWHERE. Not exactly welcome house guests. The carpet however, was the worst. There were multiple spots with tacky black stains that were literally stuck to the floor. The trash can in the kitchen didn't even have a trash liner already in it; instead the bag was draped across the top. My boyfriend and our girls suggested we use the pool, most likely because they could see the steam coming out of my ears. I layed out in one of the many lounge chairs while the rest of the brood tried out the lazy river. I was unable to relax however due to the many wasps that were buzzing around me. Now maybe I expected too much, but I thought at one point a staff member might come over and ask me if I wanted a drink. Of course this never happened. Not that I didn't see any staff; there was a young man sitting on a lounge chair texting on his cellphone, and two others chatting about the plans they had tonight once they got off of work. At this point my boyfriend joined me and said that the lazy river was lame because you had to paddle yourself along. If I remember correctly, a lazy river doesn't require you to do anything. At this point I decided that there was no way we were paying $179 a night (not including resort fees) to stay there and I called the front desk to speak to a manager. The manager, Shawn, asked if we wanted to move to another casita. No. He then told me that he could refund us the full amount and we could check out right away (the only good aspect of the entire debacle). Of this I was grateful, trust me. However, he didn't even ask why our experience was so bad that we wanted to leave. In fact, I asked him if I could tell him what was wrong! And once I told him my laundry list of disappointments, he simply said, "I'm sorry we didn't exceed your expectations." I don't expect any business to exceed my expectations, but I do expect businesses to meet them. Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak did not even come close.

I love Echo Coffee, and here's why:  1(They're open late  2(There are lot's of outlets so you don't have to fight for laptop-charging privileges  3(The drinks are excellent  4(Customers here actually know how to use their indoor voices  Like I said, the drinks are great; I've never tasted burnt espresso once. Honestly though, it's the atmosphere I love most. Most of the customers are there to study, and the one's that are there to socialize are mindful of the fact that the rest of us are working. Unfortunately my other favorite coffee shop, The Coffee Plantation on Shea, always seem to be full of obnoxious teens, speed chess players, and other forms of loud patron. Of course, this isn't a bad thing business wise (well, the teenagers are actually pretty bad, but I can't Yelp people's parents), but it is nice to be able to come to Echo and get away from the bustle. Also, they play really good music!  My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the girl at the counter isn't particularly sunny. I walked in while she was flirting with a customer, and I could tell that she was annoyed that she had to stop to take my order. The gentlemen, however, are always very pleasant.

I don't know what all these three-star reviews are about, because OHSO is legitimately awesome. In fact, it's probably my favorite bar in Phoenix! I went for the Pie and Beer event and even though they had run out of pie by the time my friend and I arrived (which sucked even more because I could see other patrons enjoying pie while I waited for a table, and it looked amazing), I was delighted by what I could order, which was 1 Cherpumple beer, 1 Coconut Joe beer (hands down our table's favorite), and 1 Amber Creek. Every beer I had was top-notch. I also ordered the calamari and Ahi Tuna appetizer, which was quite tasty (my friend's friend said it was the best calamari he's had in Phoenix, although I believe that honor goes to Hiro sushi). The burger he ordered though looked amaze-balls.  The beer is definitely the star of the show at OHSO though, which is exactly how it should be.

I won't go into detail because I can't say anything that others haven't already said about this group of thieves and liars. They showed up more than an hour late, they brought three men instead of two (which of course cost more money), and one of the movers was on his cellphone text messaging the entire time. Then to put the icing on this already very unpleasant cake, they charged me $500 more than the price they quoted before they loaded my things. So pretty much they will quote you a low rate, then hold your things hostage until you pay them a much (stupidly) higher price. When I spoke to the manager, Lisa, about this, she snidely asked, "If they were late and showed up with more people than you asked for, why did you still use our services?" Hmm, I don't know Lisa, probably because I'm an honest person who still believes that most human beings aren't bottom-feeding, lying, thieving scumballs that make a dishonest living coercing people out of their hard earned money. I still believe that, your company just happens to be an exception.    Oh yeah, and they damaged the chaise portion of my two month old sectional. Seriously, don't EVER use Desert Eagle Moving unless you like giving your money to horrible people.

My dad and I eat here literally once a week, at least. Our order is on point and delicious every time! Our favorite appetizer is the Baba Ghanouj and the calamari, although if I had to choose one over the other, the Ghanouj would win every time. For the main event, I would definitely recommend the filet mignon if you're in the mood for something hardy. If not, I would recommend the baked eggplant-it's very flavorful and has a nice kick. Besides the food, the service is always above and beyond standard, most of the servers started addressing me by name by my second visit. However, I don't go out to get treated politely, I go out to eat great food, and that's what Naya delivers! On a side note, if you like sweet wine I would definitely steer you towards the moscatto.

As another reviewer remarked, Sumo Maya is definitely hit-or-miss. I'll start with the misses: the music is so loud! However, I think this is part of the "hip" factor (although I can't be sure because I'm not hip). Also, some of the tables have plastic chairs which are both uncomfortable and look tacky too. Food-wise, I was not a huge fan of the asparagus because it was swimming in what tasted like eel sauce.Lastly, my steak was VERY expensive and not as good as it's price would have one expect. Now onto the good-I started with the seabass ceviche and it was dynamite! I love ceviche and it was one of the best I've had in a long while. We also ordered the lump crab guacamole which was also very good. What really earned the fourth star for me, though, was the service-our server Jessica M. was fabulous! The place was packed yet she still stopped by to check on us frequently. Also, my dad can be a very needy customer, but Jessica handled all of his eccentric requests with warmth and a smile. The bar manager even accommodated us far more than I would have expected him too. Everyone who works there obviously cares a great deal about the business and it shows!
