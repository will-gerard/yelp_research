This is a really fun sports bar!  A really fun atmosphere and a great place to hang out with friends, watch games and have good food and drinks.  If you're looking for a fun and unique sports bar in downtown Phoenix then check out Alice Cooperstown.

Cool outdoor setting and they they have a ton of big screens.  They play the good games/fights on their TV's and it is a cool environment but the food and service was just okay.
