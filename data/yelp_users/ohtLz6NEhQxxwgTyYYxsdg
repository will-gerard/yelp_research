I guess the owner decides to close whenever. 7:40pm and he is closing up for the night when everything advertises 9:00pm. The other Mex joint El Ranchero it is tomorrow. Better reviews anyway.

On the advice of a good friend we ordered 40 egg rolls from here for a party. Our friend is a regular at Viet Kitchen and told us they were friendly and had great customer service so we thought it worth the drive from central Phoenix. Well, she was definitely wrong! When we called in our order, we asked to have them ready by 2:00-2:30pm. When I arrived at 2:30pm to pick them up, I was told that they were not supposed to be picked up until 2pm. When I explained that it was 2:30pm, she simply said "Oh" and looked down at her order pad. I had to ask if they were ready or if they would be ready soon. She went and spoke with another woman and then told me that they would be ready in 15 min. No apology offered.  I was so irritated and would have just left, but I needed these egg rolls for the party. I was sure I would get at least an apology when they were ready,  and maybe a discount or an add on to make up for the mistake and my additional wait. When they were ready, I paid and they handed them to me. All that was said to me was that they were hot so leave the lid off. No we are sorry, no discount, nothing! They didn't even give us any sauce. This was such a frustrating experience!! Viet Kitchen needs to learn that an apology will go a long way. Even though the egg rolls were good,  we will not go there again.

Went to order chicken nuggets through the drive through. Found out McDonald's discontinued my favorite spicy/hot mustard sauce. I left without ordering anything... Won't be back. DISAPPOINTED!!

We started off with the aligator nuggets. Really like the flavor of the dipping sauce and my boy said that he like the flavor of the breading and the meat and that they were not overcooked on the inside.   We really liked the Snow Crab  in trifecta sauce with level 3 heat with a side of #4. They yelled something to my suprise when they set the #4 down, so I picked it up and took a drink.. I guess it was a tradition they do there when someone orders the #4 or #5. It wasn't too hot for me, but then again I like it HOT!! We had corn, sausage and potatoes added to the bag. The corn was great, but  we would pass on ordering the sausage and potatoes as they didn't absorb all the flavor as the corn did. Order the potatoe salad instead. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered the Mac and Cheese. To me it was really good for "Mac and Cheese". It had a little spice to it. Maybe from some jalape√±os? they add.   We also ordered the triple meat platter with ribs, brisket and chicken and Jr. ordered the pulled pork sandwich. RUDY'S has them beat on the smoked meat, but we will be back for the steam bags of seafood. We would also recommend the charred oysters.   From the looks of their old menu, they got rid of the Angry Orchard!!! Why? I was planning on ordering the "Angry Balls" from the old menu. I've tried other cider beers and they are just not my thing. Decided to stick to water today.  Great place to eat. We will be back!!!
