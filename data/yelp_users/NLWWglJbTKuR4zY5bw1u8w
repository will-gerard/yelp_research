Quite honestly..I'm surprised this place has as many stars as it does. I will say the only redeeming quality were the waitresses. The food is absolutely NOT 4 stars..ever. I ordered the biscuits and gravy thinking it had sausage in it like normal..my bad and I own that.. but the hash browns tasted very oily and the corn beef hash was extremely salty..beyond the point that it couldn't even be eaten. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. On top of that they charge $.25 for to go boxes and another $.25 for a to go coffee cup and the young kid at the register had the nerve to say it's expensive..actually it's pennies on the dollar for those things and you don't see it bankrupting any other restauraunt. If the food had been worth the price then maybe I wouldn't have complained but it was unedible..there is a reason I've only been here twice in 20 years and I was painfully reminded this morning. Don't nickel and dime your customers for subpar food. Same price food exists at IHOP and Dennys..but better quality and they don't charge for to go..may not seem a lot but it's shady..there is no disclosure prior to coming to the register which is in very poor taste and deceptive.

Their $1.99 burritos are super delicious...especially the green chili pork..their salsas are seriously hot..can't wait to try more.

Food definitely doesn't taste as good as the one on 19th and Thunderbird and Alex rolled his eyes the entire time I was trying to correct the order he messed up..thought it would be better because it's brand new but I thought wrong. I won't ever go back to that location.
