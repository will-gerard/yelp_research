I was so happy with the work done on my dress. Jenny is such a sweet and caring person. She was a little bit more money then I expected...but I've never had anything altered before and I had a change made to the dress as well as only allow a month for the changes needed. She was quick and very smart about what we could do. She cleaned and pressed my dress. It looked beautiful for my big day!!!

I had the coconut curry chicken. All tasted delicious until I bit into a black rotten potato. I proceeded to throw up my entire meal at this establishment. The waitress spoke very little English and so I couldn't convey what happened and I ultimately ended up paying for the meal. This happened on Sat 1/17/15. I will never go here again. I understand accidents happen but I am so disturbed at how she looked at me and walked away. Did not even respond to the issue.
