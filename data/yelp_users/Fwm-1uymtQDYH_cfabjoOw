I absolutely LOVE this place! Been here about a dozen times for celebratory dinners and the service has been spot on every single time. There's generally a wait, but because they have a great bar and outdoor space - my bf and I have never minded the wait. It's usually about 45 mins or so on a busy night but no wait when going for lunch. I've been to many other steakhouses throughout the valley and have YET to find a better filet than Hillstone's. Came here for New Years and because our reservation was delayed over an hour, they comped our meal. This was such a nice gesture and especially great because our out of town guests that had joined us were blown away and plan to come back. Highly recommend!

I took my new puppy to Ingleside and they got her set up on the puppy package. It was a resonable price for all three rounds of her shots and a full year's supply of heartworm meds. Everyone there is very informative and friendly. My puppy was soaking up the attention and compliments from everyone!  I've had a bazillion questions every time I've gone in, as this is the first puppy I've owned myself. The vet and vet assistants all helped me during this new learning experience.  I thoroughly enjoyed the new building, and so did the pup. It's state of the art, and inviting. I love all the beautiful photos on the walls with animal's info and if they were adopted, etc.

Thank god for the delicious food, because the poor service I've received from Shannon on numerous occasions for take-out would have deterred me from coming back a long time ago.

Good deal on happy hour- but service absolutely sucks. Finished a drink waiting to order food.

I love this place! My boyfriend works 12 hour days on his feet and could use a good foot rub on a regular basis. I try to oblige as much as possible, but for $20 for 30 minutes - this place is the better choice. It's quiet, clean and the massages are amazing! My boyfriend falls asleep everytime because it is so relaxing. I'd highly recommend! This has become one of our favorite things to do on a Friday after HH.

The place looks really nice and is very clean. I like how they have a variety of add-ons for pedicures/manicures. The pedi's were all great, the mani was just ok. I've brought out-of-town visitors here and they've always loved it.

This place is legit! Good pho, good service and the food comes out quick! Most places my bf and i request double meat, here we had leftovers - so next time we won't even need double. Prices are very good as well! Thai tea tasted like heaven. We'll definitely be back!

I'm updating my review after getting an email asking for an opportunity to come back in, and am upping my review to 4 stars! I really do enjoy walking there with my bf and our pup and hanging on the patio. They put cement down on the patio where it used to be dirt, and it makes a big difference! The service is always on point and the food is really good. The chicken Sammy and quinoa salad are bomb, and I love the white sangria - super refreshing on a warm day. Only reason why I'm not giving five stars is because I still think the servings are too small for what you're paying. Today I grabbed the salad with chicken and the avocado toast. The total was $21 for a small (but delicious!) salad and one piece of toast with avocado, tomato and mozzarella. Again, very good but a super small serving. Will I be back? Absolutely! But I may forgo grabbing a drink to make up for the food price. Thanks Ingo's, enjoy having you in our neighborhood!!

They have a good HH menu. Half off margaritas and well drinks, and a few options for starters. I got the skinny margarita and my friend got the classic. Both of us had to send them back because they were so hard to drink. I understand that they use fresh lime juice to make these, but I'm not kidding when I say I left there with the beginnings of a canker sore in my mouth due to the high acidity of that margarita. And my friend needed alka seltzer after we left from getting an upset stomach. Wish they had wine on their HH, I would have opted for that instead.  On a positive note, they have a great salsa and good atmosphere. The manager did try to help us remedy the margarita issue by getting more agave added, but they were still nearly undrinkable.  I'll Probably go back at some point for a small bite off the HH menu, but will be avoiding the margaritas.

My boyfriend and I went here for the first time for a date night and really enjoyed it! The ambience wasn't quite what I would have expected for evening dining, they have a lot of spot lights and didn't dim the lights after the sun went down so it didn't quite have that "romantic" feel. With that being said, the service was good outside of a longer than expected wait on our food. The couple that came in after us got their food quite a bit before we did. Thankfully our fried green tomatoes appetizer was delicious and held us over. My BF got the fried chicken which had the perfect breading along with a small piece of corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. I got the smoked chicken and dumplings which tasted amaaaazing! We didn't have dessert, but I've been told by others is great too. We will definitely come back!
