The staff is terrible.  Since I am rarely able to see Dr. Grade, it will be easy to leave to find another gynecologist with a friendly, inviting staff.

These folk were awesome to work with.  I am an owner/Builder and the "coaching" they gave me when they came to bid my excavation was priceless.  We even had a goof on the pool by another contractor and Justin came out and helped with no questions asked.  I am forever loyal!  Stacey Mayes Realtor

So disappointed. My clients recommend it and finally we tried it. Service was slow.  My steak came out over cooked and by the time they fixed it, I was over the whole experience. Bummer, I was hoping for great things.
