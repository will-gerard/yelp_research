My experience is exactly the same as Ursula M.  Avoid this office if at all possible.

My father went in to replace a 'dummy' phone he'd lost.  Instead of a simple replacement purchase, he was up sold to a smart phone and tablet with a data plan.  He was told he can watch all NFL games on his tablet... which is the main thing that enticed my father.  However that isn't true unless you subscribe  to a sports subscribtion with a cable or network provider.  Furthermore, my pops being old school, has no idea how to use a smartphone.  It is extremely upsetting that they would sell a product to a 75 year old man who clearly has no grasp of technology. Instead of doing what's right for the customer... these people sell what they can to make their commission checks.  Last straw was having the selling associate tell me that my father understood the capabilities  and terms of the purchase... which clearly isn't the case.   I would strongly advise people to stay clear of this third party dealer.

Wow. Simply wow.  This place makes a good... no a great donut.  They've nailed down the dough texture to perfection.   The toppings and coating taste so good when Biting down into the fluffy sweet pastry. Definitely a plus that there is no hint of grease that you my find at other places   First donut shop that I can actually recommend people try!
