Was looking for a breakfast place so we decided to stop at Grandma's Kitchen.. The atmosphere was so-so, they should have had music on or something! The waitress wasn't mean or rude, just kinda surly. I ordered the bacon, spinach and mushroom omelette, minus the 'shrooms. When I got the omelette I noticed the spinach didn't look very fresh, and upon first bite I could taste it: CANNED SPINACH!! Ew. I'm assuming the mushrooms would have been canned too, glad I left them off..

I lalalalooooooove Lolo's!! I always get the Tre-Tre's with a side of Mac n' Chs and it hasn't disappointed ONCE! The service is confusing, I'm never really sure who to tip, it seems like I have multiple servers each time I go! Try not to go around lunchtime on a Sunday if you don't want to wait forever..
