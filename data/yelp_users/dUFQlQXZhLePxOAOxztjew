I have been to T.C. Eggington's about a hundred times and it has always been fantastic! Love this place!

For breakfast, get the Albuquerque. For lunch any sandwich is a good sandwich but the godfather is amazing.  This is probably my favorite sandwich shop in Arizona. If you're a fan of hot sandwiches go straight for the godfather and don't look back.  They have decent coffee as well.

Fantastic shop. I literally can't recommend them enough. They've been my goto mechanic and now that my car is out of warranty I'll be giving them all of my business.

I was looking for another awesome breakfast restaurant apart from T.C. Eggingtons and found the Daily Dose.  I have been here a handful of times and loved everything I have got! Great place for mimosas and breakfast food!

I was planning on taking the love of my life somewhere new, and had wanted to try Matt's Big Breakfast for a long time. However I decided to take her here as they don't usually have a wait.  In the past I'd tried their breakfast burrito, and while it was fantastic I've never had a burrito that was so good that I felt I needed to sit down and brag about it on the internet.    Today our server recommended I try the Chilaquiles Verdes with chicken.  It's rare that food gives a life affirming moment but the second this bite touched my tongue I knew that everything in life was perfect.  The first bite was so awe inspiring that I worried eating the entire dish would prove overwhelming.  Thankfully this wasn't the case.  With each additional mouthful of this strange dish I tasted flavors that I didn't know existed. When I looked up into my girlfriend's eyes halfway through I saw colors that I had never seen before.     When I finally finished and became aware of my surroundings again I realized just how much I loved this place. I will be coming back much more often now.

I've been meaning to try this place for over year. I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner. Today I tried the Deep Fried Cheese and the Shredded Beef Patacon.  The deep fried cheese wasn't really my thing, I was expecting more of a mozeralla stick than whatever it was that they brought out.  Chances are it was made perfect and just not my kind of thing so no negative rating there.  The Patacon however was amazing, I'm planning on buying deep fried plantains and carrying them around with me everywhere I go so I can substitute them from bread at other delicious restaurants like Z-Cafe.

I decided to try somewhere new for lunch today and my girlfriend suggested we head to this place. Checked Yelp and was excited to see a few good reviews. We arrived and were seated quickly by a very nice hostess.  Our server came over and while he was friendly and attentive he smelled terrible.  Every time he walked by our table he trailed a tear inducing odor. We still weren't ready to completely give up on the place despite the server's poor hygiene and decided to order:  Chicken Bruschetta A small Pepperoni Pizza and some Fettuccine Alfredo  The Chicken Bruschetta came out first and looked fantastic. The presentation was excellent but upon biting into it we learned it was made entirely from salt. The sliced chicken on top of it looked as if it had been bought frozen and just thawed and tossed on top.  When the Pizza and the Alfredo came, again both looked amazing, we were setup for even more disappointment.  How you screw up Alfredo is beyond me but it seemed like they forgot to add cheese and just gave us some noodles in a pool of condensed milk.  I never thought of pouring milk over noodles for breakfast but now I know that it wouldn't substitute for cereal.  Now onto the pizza, I'll be honest it I liked it. A little bit heavy on the cheese but if we had just gotten this take out and not sat in to enjoy the scents I probably would have given the place a 4.  However even pizza is extremely hard to choke that down with a scent that can best be described as urine soaked hobo. We paid, left, and probably still tipped better than we should have.  I wouldn't recommend this place, if the servers can't be bothered to shower and wash their clothes once in a while who knows what goes on in the back.

The girlfriend and I found this place through Groupon, much like everyone else on the planet. Unfortunately our schedules meant that it took us forever to actually get down here but we definitely weren't disappointed.  We had a fantastic time and are already looking into taking some of their additional classes.
