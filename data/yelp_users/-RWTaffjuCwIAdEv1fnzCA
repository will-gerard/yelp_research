Dear T.J. or whatever gentleman I spoke to on the early afternoon on 10/13  My boyfriend Alex and I had a nice stay at the hotel. The staff was very nice and accommodating and over all the place is very nice. Our reasoning for staying here was because our apartment flooded and we were kicked out for a few days. Fortunately, our apartment paid for us and our dogs to say. Except the apartment has been giving us a lot of issues with response time and giving us updates. Needless to say it has been a very stressful occasion. The stay at the holiday inn made it a little better. Until...... I get a call from TJ today who explained the apartment only paid until today and made the following statement: You need to get out of the hotel today.  This took me off guard of course. I had no understanding for the situation at all. I thought our apartment took care of it. Tjs initial exclamation that we need to leave or pay certainly offended me. I believe the better customer service approach would be to ask questions before making any assumptions. Yes I know the file said our stay was until 10/13 but rather than stating we need to "get out", perhaps you should have had a better understand of the situation before making a statement like that. This entire event has been extremely stressful on us and to hear a comment like that did not help and put me into panic mode. So TJ or whoever you are that spoke to me early afternoon today, perhaps you should take some coaching from the other staff on the team as they seem to understand customer service a little better. They can thank you for the low rating.

Absolutely rude people that work here. Rather than asking me for assistance she sat and stared at my shirt. I don't feel that I should be discriminated against for what I'm wearing just because it didn't fit with their standards. I asked for help and she continued to look at my chest area and reluctantly answered my question. Needless to say I didn't make a purchase there.

I will rarely take the time to complain about service, but this place is terrible. We sat for 10 or more minutes until we were acknowledged, not by our server, but a manager. Then maybe five minutes later (I am being fair here) a server brought our drinks  we ordered from the manager and almost walked away without taking our order. Furthermore, there was no apology for our 15 minute wait just to get our drinks. Mind you it wasn't even that busy. None of the servers smiled, the margaritas were not great and were mostly mix, and the food was way over priced. I got two tiny bland fish tacos for $12. If you're looking for good service and good Mexican food, I recommend going somewhere else. Otherwise, by all means don't say you weren't warned.

I was reluctant to go because of the price and what I heard about the lines. However, despite my best just segment my curiosity overcame me and I decided go. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. They put a lot of work into the set and the performers are amazing. They get really into what they do which makes it feel very realistic. It was an awesome experience and I'm glad I went.

I had a wonderful experience here. I will be honest and admit that my first experience was not the best but I was extremely pleased with the response I got after my feedback was given. The coordinator reached out to me immediately to apologize and I decided to give it a second shot. I went there on a Friday night and was given some of the best service ever followed by some of the best food. We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely ambiance and enjoyed a tour of the menu. They have a unique selection of Mexican cuisine and have some of the best guacamole I've ever tasted. I also have to add that the margaritas were amazing! My favorite was the jalape√±o cucumber marg.  I would certainly recommend this place and plan on returning. Thank you Cyndi! And thank you to the server as well!
