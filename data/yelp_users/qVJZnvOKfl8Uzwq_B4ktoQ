It was fun to see all the different types of cacti! It got a little repetitive after a while though. The Chihuly exhibit being there is really what pushed it to 4 stars for me.  I would probably go back, but it's not something I would do super frequently.

I am not usually a huge fan of the zoo, but this one was great.   The animals seem well taken care of, and their cages look like enclosures instead, which I think is really important.    I loved the set up and would definitely go back again. Loved how they integrated the natural landscaping for some of the animals (re: onyx). Go check it out!  They also have a place to pet goats! That was sweeeeeet.

Wow. What nice people.   I just moved here from Virginia and my car failed the emission test (womp).  I quickly scanned yelp for some good places and I'm glad I settled on this one.  Consistently superior reviews and for a reason!  Tom was helpful and explained why my car failed, the approximate cost to fix it, and what I would need to do afterwards in order to go back through emissions.    I'll definitely be back here to have the other car worked on!

I thought this place was pretty good. I kind of suck when it comes to reviewing pizza...I love anything dough-y that has cheese and sauce on it.  It's a bit pricey (18" pie was about $24.00). We got olives and pineapple on it and I have no complaints.   The guy running the place was very friendly as well! That always adds a star in my book. I'll go back on my next trip to Phoenix.

This Michael's is disorganized!   The employees all seem completely discontent with their lives. I asked one of the employees where I could find clothes pins and he dropped all of the stuff he was holding on the floor and huffed and puffed to a new section.  It seemed like I was completely inconveniencing him, but the store is in such a disarray!   There was a nice clerk at the front; she was the store's only saving grace from 1 star. :)

I love this place! There are so many trails ranging from an easy half mile to a rigorous 15. You can't go wrong. :) We took the Mormon Trail to Happy Valley where we got to see the Natural Bridge. I don't think we saw Fat Man's Pass, although we looked for it.   We made a huge mistake on the way back and took Mormon Loop to head to parking lot instead of Mormon Trail. We just assumed the Mormon trial looped around. ;) We ended up on 48th st. and we were parked at 24th. It would've been a hefty hike back, but the ranger kindly offered us a ride! She also suggested we take a picture of the map at the beginning of each trail, in case we were confused again. Good advice- we definitely will!  On the ride to our car (haha...so embarrassing...), the ranger also told us about the two events the park does each year. There's a hike across the National Trail (15.3mi) and at the end the park serves lunch. The other is a summit challenge where you can do 4, 5, or 6 summits in a day. At the end of both (at least I think it's both...) there's music, beer, food, etc. They both sound super cool! I wish I had known about them earlier.   We'll definitely be coming here even in the hot summer months!

Look, I'm not proud of how often I go to Filiberto's. Being in Arizona I should be eating at legit Mexican restaurants or something... But burritos aren't even a thing in Mexico, so I'll just treat this as an ambiguously ethnic treat.   I always get the veggie burrito. Delicious refried beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, and onion. I soak it in the green sauce for a little extra flavor/heat. The red sauce they offer is "meh," so just skip that one and ask for double green. The burrito is only $5 something and huge.   Unfortunately, this particular  location is extremely slow. Sometimes I wonder if Filiberto is the only one back there. Even so, the cashiers are always polite and friendly.   Side note: one time I got some chips with my meal and they were just out of the fryer. Yum!

Look, it's cheap. But a cheap gym doesn't have to be a dirty, unkempt gym.  1) The mats are virtually unusable. People never wipe them down. Whenever I take a wipe to any of them, there's a thick layer of dirt. Ew. The staff needs to wipe or santize these down EVERYDAY.  2) The staff doesn't seem to wipe down any machines or equipment during the day.  3) The locker rooms are dirty. I saw one of the cleaning staff just take some toilet paper and wipe the toilet seats. No cleaner used. What the heck? 4) No free Wi-FI. This was very surprising to me. I've never had a gym membership that did not provide this as a courtesy to members. So many people rely on streaming music while working out. The wi-fi they do have (they'll give you password if you buy from the Nrgize bar) is very, very slow. Last time I went in they had changed the password, but the receipt still had the old password. And the girl at the bar "had no clue" what the new password was.  This part of the review is for fellow gym-goers.  1) Please, for the safety of other members, stop grunting dramatically and throwing your weights on the ground after you do dumbbell work. I had a giant bruise on my foot from a bro throwing his weights down after he did 100 pound dumbbell presses. If you can't handle the weight responsibly, simple move down in weight. Not to mention this can tear your rotator cuff faster than you can say "do you even lift." 2). Re-rack. Your. Damn. Weights. Overall, disappointing gym. Could be so much better!

Delicious, cheap water & fast, friendly service! We purchased a cooler here along with two (2) 5 gal water jugs.  We got 50 free gallons of water with our cooler purchase which is a nice discount. You can also purchase $15 water cards, which makes a 5 gallon jug only $1.50 to fill instead of $2.00.    Definitely check it out. It's cheaper than purchasing most plastic bottled waters and you're avoiding a ton of plastic waste.

Love this place.  Do you need furniture? They have it. Lots of it. Jewelry? Check. Old-school pyrex? Check.  Things you certainly don't need but are pleasing to the eye? Double check.   I have gotten a wicker basket and a lovely dresser from here.  One of the employees, Lionel, will deliver furniture items/larger pieces for a reasonable price (depending on how far you traveled).   You can get the price down on most of the items unless they are market "firm." Can't wait to go back!

The bands that I've seen here: 5 stars!  I've never been disappointed with a show.  Venue? I've been to better; 3 stars.  Security gets annoyed at seemingly unimportant things. I've seen them take someone out of a concert for using a GoPro, but let weed slide...weird. The bathrooms can get pretty grotesque through the night. The floor also gets sticky/slimy...but that's just kind of how it goes. Additionally, the parking lot is pretty small.   Could be better, could be worse; I'll still be back because they host great artists!

We ordered the vegetarian combination which comes with medium spicy red split lentils (9), collards (8), string beans & carrots (7), and cabbage, potatoes & carrots (11). We also ordered  three other vegetarian dishes: brown lentils (6), ground peas (10), and yellow split peas (12) . The only vegetarian dish we didn't end up trying was timatim fitfit (13). It just didn't appeal to either of us. My favorites were the brown lentils and the string beans. The brown lentils are served cold which may not appeal to some people; however, I thought the flavors were delightful- vinegary with lots of spices. The string beans tasted a lot like the Greek-style green beans I've had at Greek festivals. I would get both of those again. My least favorites were the ground peas and the collards. Whatever the dominant spice was in the ground peas, I didn't like it.  The collards just lacked overall flavor.    Everything is served with plenty of injera. It's basically a crepe and very...squishy. Towards the end of my meal the texture of the injera was not appealing to me. I did like that it was sourdough, though.   The staff is friendly enough and helpful if you don't know what to order. The overall appearance of the restaurant could use some work. The main dining area was carpeted and a bit dirty; the bathroom is a bit of an eye-sore.    Note for VEGANS or DAIRY-SENSITIVE people: My boyfriend and I are both vegan, and based on the descriptions, everything on the vegetarian menu is vegan. I should have double-checked with the waitress, since I ended up with a stomach ache (usually happens when I end up eating dairy).    We probably won't be back just because neither of us were overwhelmed with affection for the place. I definitely recommend checking it out to decide for yourself.

Um...I am confused with all the great reviews. Granted I am from Richmond, Va where lots of restaurants do vegan/vegetarian, and they do it really, really well.   This place is quasi-vegetarian foods. It's just mock meats...where are the black bean burgers, the lentil burgers, the wholesome vegetables?!?! Wah. I was really disappointed. This is definitely a place to ease people into vegetarianism.   I got the blackened jerk chicken pita (it wasn't spicy....?) and my boyfriend got the chicken parm (obviously not real chicken on either). Both were valiant attempts. They still failed. The fries were good, though.   I would give it only 1 star, but we did go at 8:15 pm and they close at 9. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt....  The service was also really bad. Lady didn't look at us while we ordered (her eyes were wandering around), the bathrooms are outside with no signage, and I guess you are supposed to assume you order at the counter?   I am not trying to make this overly-critical, but this place could do A LOT better in many ways. I probably won't go back unfortunately; too bad, I was looking forward to this!

Nice selection of vintage trinkets, boots, and jeans.  I didn't end up purchasing anything but I'll be back when I have more time to look. The owner was friendly and helpful the whole time.    It's a little tricky to find...The larger signs that list the shops says VINTAGE (not Blue Jean Buyer).

The reviews here will range from "most difficult hike you'll ever do" to "I ran up this friggin' mountain in 20 minutes." Objectively speaking, this is NOT the hardest hike in Arizona.  Subjectively, it may be the hardest hike you'll ever do in Arizona. It might be one of the easiest. Wherever you lie on the spectrum, the hike is worth it.   I did this trail as a hiking newbie, but as someone who works out 6 days a week, with 50% of my workouts involving cardio. I set a moderate pace and found myself short of breath at times. I made it to the top in 40 minutes.  If you find the idea of this trail too daunting, try Sunrise Trail in Scottsdale. It's still a workout, but less strenuous, and the gradient isn't so steep. If you don't want a rugged experience at all, but still want a great view, check out North Mountain Park. You can take a paved path all the way to the top (trail 44, I believe). Want something more difficult than Camelback with more rock scrambling? Try Flatiron in the Superstition Mountains.    If you're trying to do the hike on the weekend during tourist season: go mid-day, between 12-3pm. There will be people, but less than if you went at sunrise/sunset.  If you want to see a cool sunrise/sunset, try a less occupied trail so you can really enjoy the experience. Parking is the biggest biotch here. You'll get a spot without as much trouble if you go when I suggested.   You can do this trail without hiking shoes, but they are helpful, especially on the way down. I recommend 1-1.5L of water per person.

"Piestewa Peak" is not a trail. The popular trail people are referring to is Summit Trail. If you are confused on where to go, just look at a map in one of the parking lots (or go to the lot where you see the most cars).   I went on a weekday around 2pm. Parking lot was mostly crowded so I can only imagine the weekend. There are bathrooms close by just one lot away (if facing the mountain, it's to the right). No more than a 3-5 min walk.   Trail is well-travelled and easy to follow. The gradient is manageable for all fitness levels, but if up-hill cardio isn't part of your routine, be prepared to sweat and pant like a rabid dog, especially if it's hot out. Stellar views the entire time. Summit is amazing.   I didn't stay at the top long because I was attacked by gnats galore. Why do hikers insist on leaving their orange peels to rot? Friggin' carry them down.   Hiking shoes not required for this hike, but very helpful.   Overall I found this hike to be very enjoyable and will be back again.

Went in at 9pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. We asked them if anything on the menu could be made dairy/egg/meat free and it turns out they are incredibly veg-friendly!  We ordered the Gaeng Kua Sapparod with tofu and the drunken noodles also with tofu. I enjoyed both, but I was particularly fond of the curry. Subtly sweet coconut broth enhanced by the big hunks of pineapple, lime leaves, and fried tofu. The drunken noodles were like any drunken noodles, nothing special to report. I liked them though, for sure. I only wish the serving of jasmine rice had been larger. We needed to order a second bowl.   Service was prompt, friendly, and courteous. The place was near closing and a little messy, but it wasn't bothersome. I'll be back. Lots of yummy dishes to try.

Great selection of hikes! I did trail 44 (I think). I took the paved path to the top, where you get killer views of the Valley. In fact, there are killer views the entire way up. The walk up is fairly easy and not very long.   Once at the top, I wanted more of a workout, so I took the rugged way down. This path was super fun. A little more challenging than the paved path, and requires careful stepping. Once I got to the bottom I walked back up, and then back down the paved path. On the way back up the unpaved part, I got a teensy bit off trail, and had to shimmy my way down some loose rocks. It's pretty well marked, but I wasn't paying close attention. It took me a little over an hour to finish up 2x and down 2x. Really fun area!   Do note: bathroom stalls inside restroom do not have doors.

REVIEW BASED ON HORCHATA ONLY.  All I had was the horchata, but boy was it magnificient! We almost ate there...and then I saw the guy in the back cutting up the meat, and I was like, "nah...."  I'm sure it's great though!

Oh, Dutch Bros., how I love thee.   I'm an East Coaster and boy do I look forward to some DB when I visit Arizona.  I have tried every specialty drink, but my absolute favorites are the KICKER, COCOMO, and CHAI TEA LATTE.  They're all wonderful iced; I haven't tried anything but the WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA hot (it's Arizona after-all).    Their plain coffee is also spot-on! I get that with 2% milk and am always satisfied.  The employees are also EXTREMELY friendly.  I love that they ask about my day: what I have planned, what I do for work, etc.  They seem genuinely interested in what I have going on (I don't really care if it's a ruse...:)   They will always get my business!

Food was great. I got the paneer and my boyfriend got the chick pea something-or-other (sorry, I could look it up, but I'm too lazy). The spice levels here are great as well. We both got a 7; definitely enough to make your nose run, but not enough to make the food unbearably hot.  The naan was also fresh and delicious.  I'd definitely go back! Portion sizes are enormous. We had enough for us both to eat a second meal out of it.   Side note: it feels like you're eating in a palace with the silver cups and plates at your table. Ha.

Service/food/ambiance = 3.5  On my first dinner here, I had a vegan pasty. The filling was good, but the pastry was dry and overdone. The plus? It's a large portion; if nothing else, I left with a full stomach. On my second dining experience, I wanted a lighter meal. I ordered the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup, with a Greek salad (no feta). The soup was flavorful, creamy, and well made. It came with sturdy bread that was perfect for soaking up the deliciousness. The salad came with a pesto dressing that was also tasty; as expected, the salad ingredients themselves were ordinary. Pieces of both meals I had here were well done, but they were still lacking in flavor and attention. Those with me ordered the vegan Mexican pasty. They both really enjoyed it.   They have a decent drink selection so definitely look that over. I ordered the Union Jack. Refreshingly light with a bit of tang, hint of sweetness, and a hefty ABV.   The servers bleed the hipster laissez faire attitude. Take from that what you will. Lastly, bathroom could be cleaner.

The Garcia's on Thomas Rd. is 10x better than this location.  This location has much higher traffic than any other Garcia's we've been to.  We had a 45 minute wait on a Saturday.    The table was dirty when we were seated (food from previous patrons; appetizer plate wasn't cleaned well in dishwasher). The waitress remedied the situation quickly.    FOOD:  I had a skinny margarita that was pretty bad.  Made from a way-too-sugary mix.    We got the nachos for an appetizer and split the spinach enchiladas for our entree. Sizable portions for both. I only took one bite of the entree we split since the nachos were enough for a meal, even when splitting.   The flavors left much to be desired. Nachos can only be so bad, but it's clearly pre-made guacamole and generic pre-grated cheese. I didn't taste the beans and rice that came with the enchilada, but my boyfriend said they tasted like standard chain restaurant beans and rice. The enchilada had minimal flavor.   This Garcia's didn't live up to our previous experiences.  I know, I know, it's a chain, but I've had some good food previously! My suggestion: do a little Yelping and find an authentic Mexican restaurant nearby.

I specifically went here because of the glowing reviews on ZocDoc for Mary Frazee. She is new, so if you've had a poor experience here in the past, give her a chance!   I went in for an IUD consult and she was extremely welcoming, gentle, and attentive. She went above-and-beyond with beside manner, and in a sensitive environment like the gynecologist, this is much appreciated. She discussed the options I had for devices thoroughly: the biggest pros for each method, the reasons people generally have them removed, and answered any general questions I had. She then did an examination to make sure my uterus was the right size for the choice I was leaning towards. She was extremely professional with just the right amount of humor.   Before we scheduled my next appointment, she wanted to make sure my insurance covered the procedure. What a lady! Insurance got back quickly and I was able to schedule another appointment 48 hrs later to have the procedure done.   I think it's extremely important to support Nurse Practitioners, and Mary Frazee is a great example on why they enrich the medical field. :)

This is my first experience with a laundromat, but not my first experience with communal washer/dryers. I was so fed up with my apartment's dingy, unreliable, and over-priced machines. I finally decided convenience wasn't enough to keep using those awful machines.   Eco Laundry exceeded my expectations 10-fold. I thought I was going to need about 7-8 machines (based on standard washing machines), but to my surprise, they have giant 5 load machines! I fit everything in two washers. They also have 1, 2, 3, and 6 load machines (no 4 for whatever reason).   They have 30 lb and 50 lb dryers. I used the 50 lb dryer and had at least, but not limited to, 5 body towels, a bedding set (WITH comforter), and two weeks worth of laundry for two people. It all dried in 70 minutes. In the future (and I will be back), I'll probably use the 30 lb machines so I can be in and out faster.   They have a drop-off service for .99c a pound if you want to not even deal with washing yourself. Other nice things: ample seating, laundry carts, and free wi-fi.   It started to get a little busy on a Wednesday so I'm guessing the weekends are less pleasant. Anyway, glad this place exists!

My boyfriend put it well when he said, "this place forces me to come to terms with the limitations of my brain."   This museum is extremely organized and comprehensive. They have musical instruments from virtually every country on every continent.  Talk about overwhelming.  You cannot see it all unless you make this museum a multi-day event. They give you headphones that turn on when you walk by a TV!   I learned so much, and I know if I go back, I'll learn even more.    I wouldn't recommend bringing kids. You will spend a minimum of 2 hours here.

These were good cupcakes.  Not "good for a vegan cupcake," just good! I tried the SALTED CARAMEL and the BANANA. My boyfriend had the FRENCH TOAST. I liked the BANANA best (4 stars). Strong banana flavor and a nice balance with the vanilla frosting. It was slightly over-baked and needed a bit more moistness going on, but still very scrumptious. The SALTED CARAMEL (3 stars) I also enjoyed. However, they way over did it with the sugar/sweetness. It was hard to enjoy the last couple bites because the sugar was off the charts high. I don't think the "salted" part came into the equation enough. I still enjoyed the favors, and the middle had a syrupy center which was delightful! My boyfriend enjoyed the FRENCH TOAST cupcake (4 stars). But, again, overly-sweet. He could not finish it. I tasted a bite and agreed they need to tone it down. It makes it hard to get the "French toast-y" flavor when it's too sweet. I'd definitely try these again and would recommend it to friends! I'd make this a 3.5 star review but the ladies were very sweet and friendly! Cupcakes are on the pricier side at 2.50 a piece.

It's been a while since I have eaten here, but I thought I should review it anyway.   We started with the chips & salsa. Nothing special, just wanted something to munch. I wouldn't recommend getting them. For our meals, I had the Jalapeno Popper Burger and my boyfriend had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger. The star of each burger is in the name: jalapeno poppers and mac-n-cheese, respectively. I loved the creamy texture of the cream cheese in the burger. For obvious reasons, my boyfriend loved the mac-n-cheese burger (there's also bacon). Both were a good size. I don't remember the fries being remarkable. The real star of the show is the creative burger.    Good burger place. Worth trying out if you don't mind the heartburn afterwards.

For the price, Filiberto's gets 4 stars from me! The only thing I can eat here is the veggie burrito, but you'll never catch me complaining. It's a humongous tortilla stuffed with refried beans, rice, onion, and guacamole (maybe this varies by location, because sometimes I get it and sometimes I don't).   It's super satisfying for my wallet and my belly.   Side note: the refried beans are lard-free so that makes this burrito vegan. Weeeeeeeee!

What the hell is happening here? They were out of half the doughnuts we requested, and the ones we did get were the smallest doughnuts I've ever seen! The Oreo doughnut fit in the palm of my hand. If I wanted to hold something cute, I'd go to the animal shelter.   The taste could've saved them from a one-star review, but alas, the outside was hard. Their "hot" sign was also on (which was the catalyst for going in the first place); but what do you know, they weren't hot.   We don't get doughnuts often and we'll certainly never get Krispy Kreme again.

Really tasty. My sweet boyfriend delivered one of these to me and it was the best treat! I had a large white chocolate mocha. It was a wonderful blend of flavors, and the sweetness wasn't overhwhelming. One of my favorite coffee drinks and sooooo worth the calories! 1000x better than Starbucks.   I hear the service is awesome. One day I'll have to go in and experience it.

Definitely one of the better coffee joints I've been to in the Valley. I had an hour before an appointment, so I stopped in here and had a small cold brew coffee. It had wonderful flavor! I'd definitely get it again.   The decor inside is very unique, creative, and inviting. My favorite part was the old Jamison bottle that is now a soap pump!   There's plenty of seating, both inside and outside. I saw several business meetings  in-progress and several college-age students with laptops. Must be a popular place to do work!   If I am in Scottsdale again soon, I'll definitely stop back by for another cold brew.

I give this place four stars for the happy hour prices.  I'd probably give it 3.5 if I had to pay full price.   Went in on Monday around 4:30. Decently busy, but the three of us were able to get a table immediately outside. Nice patio area with a little bit of shade and well-placed misters.   We all decided to get tacos ($2/piece at HR) and margaritas ($5 @ HR).    We split an appetizer of guacamole which was very, very good. A small portion for $8, but we were saving on the tacos, so we decided to go for it. Definitely try it.    I decided to go with three veggie tacos and a cucumber-serrano margarita.  My boyfriend had the same tacos and my friend had the braised beef, crispy fish, and baja fish (latter two not happy hour tacos, FYI).  I thought my tacos were pretty good, but lacked some depth of flavor.  My friend really enjoyed all three and even compared the crispy fish taco to some tacos she's had in Mexico! Not bad.  Presentation of all the tacos was spot-on.   The margarita I ordered was a perfect sweetness and very refreshing. It came rimmed with chili powder and salt and a hefty slice of cucumber inside with small pieces of serrano. It wasn't spicy at all and I would've liked a little more heat, but it was definitely the best marg. at the table! The other two margaritas my friends ordered were unpleasantly sweet.  Those were the blood orange and the passion fruit margaritas. I'd skip those unless you're into adult fruit juice.   My dinner-mates also got two sides (normally $1 with a purchase of 3 tacos). Even though my boyfriend's tacos were all happy hour options, she still gave him the $1 deal (you're not supposed to do that...She was very friendly). They also got the cucumber orange salad, which was lacking a bit in flavor. There needed to be a better cucumber-to-orange ratio (it was about 95% cukes); the other side ordered was the black beans. Those, on the other hand, were AMAZING.     Staff is all very friendly and fun! Check this place out.

This was one of my favorite meals...ever. Since I was only in-town for 10 days, I was determined to find authentic Mexican tacos in Phoenix. This place delivered!  When we arrived they asked if we had ever been there before. When we told them no, they allowed us to try EVERY type of meat.  I was in love with all of them, but I ended up getting the 3 LARGE tacos with two types of pork, and one type of chicken. Sorry that I can't remember the exact names.  I got them with all the toppings- fresh cilantro, corn, salsa, cabbage, cheese, pickled onions, and sour cream.  5 STARS! They were so fresh and flavorful; my mouth and belly were so happy!   My boyfriend got the 1 lb burrito with all the fixins as well. It was Chipotle-sized, but with even fresher ingredients and better flavor!   We were feeling rather gluttonous this evening, so we ordered the nachos as well. We got those with cheese, tomatoes, cilantro, cabbage, and corn.    They have a salsa bar that has so many options. There are also some pickled peppers that you MUST try.    You have to come here. It's got such a fun wrestling theme too!  I am already dreaming of my next trip here in July. :)

Holy shiiii-take mushrooms this place was good.   I had the RIBEYE TACOS. Generous portion of steak topped with cabbage and avocado. It comes with a side of liquid quacamole (probably more traditional), chipotle (think smoky flavor) salsa, a roasted poblano pepper, and a roasted shallot.    There is a salsa/pickled vegetable bar where you can grab different toppings for your food. I especially loved the pickled carrots and onions. The cucumbers were not pickled, but they were well marinated with oregano and vinegar.    We also started with some CHIPS AND GUAC/SALSA.Guac was filled with delicious ingredients (very chunky, like Chipotle's, but better).  I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa but it was certainly flavorful.    We took a generous portion of chocolate strawberry tres leches cake home. I'll dive into that after I run a few miles. :)  My only complaint?  I asked for my meat mediumand it came well done.  Can I please just have this every day for the rest of my life?

NO BATHROOM AT TRAIL! PEE BEFOREHAND (or behind a cactus...like I had to...).   Awesome switchback trail. And it wasn't crowded at all. There were maybe 10 people at the top when we arrived, but only ran into 2-3 heading up. Since it's a switchback (zig-zag pattern), the trail is on a consistent gradient making it manageable for any fitness level. Some parts might have you breathing heavy but this trail isnt occupied like Camelback, so you won't be in anyone's way if you decide to break. The last .25 miles to the peak is steeper than the rest, but don't give up, the view is awesome! Lots of loose rocks on trail so wear good hiking shoes.

This was fun! I was a little put(t) off when we first arrived since it seemed like everyone inside was 15 or under. I spotted a couple towards the back, which made me feel better about my activity of choice.   I enjoyed that everything was glow-in-the-dark. It added a little flair to a tried-and-true activity. The price was about average, $10 for the 18 holes.Only $5 if you decide to do another round. Not too bad.  If you get a hole-in-one at the 18th hole, you get a prize, which happens to be a free round. My boyfriend made it in, but I didn't, so we decided to save the coupon for another time.    There are "charging" stations every other hole or so where you can put your ball to make it glow brighter. Shamelessly admitting I really enjoyed doing that.  You also get a glow in the dark bracelet, ha!  The music is top 40, which was the only negative to the experience. I'd go again!   Side note: You have to walk down stairs to get to there. It might seem like it doesn't exist at first, but it's just tucked away. The parking lot was also very crowded on the weekend.

Awesome! Went with a large group and ordered wine and bruschetta for hours. Great atmosphere. We tried many types of bruschetta: warm artichoke, smoked salmon with capers and red onion, brie & apple, traditional, white bean with chopped tomatoes, and bacon, burrata, tomato and arugula.    They were all on thick slices of bread and generously loaded with the toppings.  I loved all of them, but the smoked salmon with capers and red onion stood out as the best one. Absolutely delicious.    We tried the Cabernet Sauvingnon and Malbec.  Enjoyed both of these full-bodied wines, perhaps the Malbec ever-so-slightly more than the Cab.   Service was a bit slow. Wasn't a big deal since we were planning on being there for several hours.     The $20 deal for bruschetta and a bottle of wine was awesome. We'll definitely be back!

Definitely a solid 4 stars for the food and 5 stars for service.   We went in for a (very) late dinner and were instantly greeted by a dauntingly expansive menu and extra-helpful staff.   I was wearing a shirt from the Vegan Food Fest and the employee immediately asked me if I had dietary restrictions. I love when restaurants have lots of vegetarian/vegan options available!   I ended up getting the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian (artichokes, grilled mushroom, pesto, provolone) on the Dutch crunch bread. Sandwich was very good and I loved the texture of the bread! If there had been a better ratio between the veggies and sauce, I would've given it 5 stars. There was scant pesto, but a lot of of mayo/sauce/something mayo-based. I'm not a mayo fan (I think they call it "dirty sauce") and there was WAY too much of it. My boyfriend got the Jeremy Stoppleman (breaded eggplant, grilled tomato, habanero salsa, pesto, provolone). He gave his four stars as well. His complaints were too much mayo and not enough toppings. Next time we'll be sure to ask for no sauce. :)   Our sandwiches also came with caramel apple suckers (which were actually delicious, haha).   Overall, the service was outstanding and the food was good. We'll be back for sure!

Good food! All of the foods have the traditional names, but there is an English description below each dish- just grab a menu.   We tried the chickpea curry, samosas, aloo bonda, and a potato curry. For a small establishment inside of a market, they do a great job with presentation. All of our food looked tantalizing.   My favorite was the potato curry. So much flavor. The aloo bonda was also good, but the oil that the aloo bonda/samosas were fried in tasted old. They would've been the highlight otherwise. The chickpea curry was fine, but lacked flavor. The Indian flatbreads that come with the chickpea curry were AMAZING. The potato curry came with lentil soup, roti, and white rice. Both of the appetizers came with green and red chutney (sorry, I don't know what they are traditionally called!) We left very full.   I also love that we were able to get everything vegan. :)

Ah, amazing! We got the yellow curry and pad thai delivered (fulfilled through Eat24) and it was way better than expected.   You have the choice between mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy for each dish. We did spicy, but I wish we had done extra spicy. Didn't quite kick me in the mouth like I was hoping. Even so, the flavors were phenomenal. The yellow curry was so luxuriously creamy and rich. Wonderful balance of flavors with spices, tofu, broccoli, potatoes, and peppers. The curry was slightly sweet, so the pad thai was the perfect savory compliment. The pad thai noodles were cooked well and it had such wonderful flavors going on.   Servings are enormous. We have enough left over for two more meals or one large, indulgent meal.   Delivery took about an hour on a Monday evening. I expect it'd be longer on the weekend.

**3.5 star review** 3 stars for wax, and 4 stars for the whole experience.   It's hard for me to rate this place. I won't be back, but I know some people would really enjoy this experience.    The pros:  - Very friendly estheticians (Julie is so friendly and puts you at ease!) - Clean and inviting facility - They wax very small sections of hair at a time, making it a relatively pain-free experience.   The HUGE con:  - It takes 3x as long for a wax. I went in at 10 am for a Brazilian wax and left around 11:30 am. As much as I appreciated the new waxing experience, I don't have time in my schedule for a 90 min. waxing appointment. :( I'll be heading back to my old place where it's 15-20 minutes.

Really unique coffee shop and gallery.   Coffee: 3.5 stars  I went in around 10 to get a coffee and do some work. The employee that took my order was extremely friendly (I think it was the owner).  I ended up just getting a house coffee with soy milk. I liked that they gave me the soymilk container to put the amount that I wanted. Coffee was so-so. The blended drinks seemq quite popular, so if you're into those, give it a shot.   Ambiance/customer service/space: 5 stars There are paintings, jewelry, and other knick-knacks for sale inside the shop. There are also a multitude of outlets. Often times you have to fight off Jane Doe for electricity, but not here! I really, really appreciated that fact, even though it wasn't extremely busy.  The bathroom was ridiculously elegant. The sink is a giant lion's face carved from stone. Whaaaaaaat.  Lots of super plush (ginormous) chairs, table seating, and outdoor spots.    Give this place a chance. I'll definitely be back. I had my eye on some turquoise earrings. :)

DRINK REVIEW ONLY. FYI, if you check in on Facebook, you get an extra 30 minutes of happy hour. Woo!   We went for drinks at happy hours (3-6pm weekdays) on a Friday and the place was completely packed. They have an incredible outdoor space complete with a of couple corn hole sets. A great option for hanging out with coworkers or friends after work.  I had the Farmhouse Ale and the  Koffee Kölsch.   The Farmhouse Ale was light and smooth. It touts an impressive ABV at 10%. For a $4 happy hour price, you can't go wrong.   The real highlight was the Koffee Kölsch. Holy smokes. It was SO good. The smell was incredibly enticing and aromatic. Sometimes that's where the flavor profile ends, but not with this beer. The coffee flavor was near exquisite. I wish I had gotten two of these! I'll definitely be looking for it in stores, because OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD.

Soooooo fun. I'm slightly inebriated, but that'll just make this review even more impressive.  The ambiance was awesome: soulful music, perfect weather, and a great crowd of people.   I had a shilling IPA from Odell that was the best IPA of the night. My overall favorite drink was the Bourbon cider from Woodchuck. The hard dry cider (forget name) and Gumpton cider from Woodchuck are both worth trying as well. I'm not a huge beer drinker, so take this portion of the review for what it is. ;)  I had a lackluster pizza that had approximately a teaspoon of sauce and scant olives. Quite pricey for 10" ($11). I did ask for no cheese (yes-I'm that person), but was still expecting more sauce/topping.  I got some free goodies, too! A lei and a t-shirt (from Woodchuck...cause I kept going back...)   Thanks for the ticket, Yelp!   Now, who's impressed with my drunk texting ability?

Incredible food, immaculately clean dining area/restrooms, and great service. What more could you want?  I had the kimchi hot stone veganized (i.e. no egg). Very generous portion of rice, vegetables, kimchi, spices, and oil. It came out boiling hot! If you can wait -and I know that's asking a lot- let the rice on the bottom crisp up a little from the hot stone before you eat. Scrape up those crispy rice pieces and savor it. The dish tastes better the longer you stir as well. Good thing chopsticks make you eat slower. They also have several Korean appetizers that they bring to your table. My favorite was the pickled cucumbers.   I only tried one other dish at the table: kimchi cold noodles (Kimchi Bibim Guksu), which was also great.   They ever brought us complimentary tiramisu cake! I didn't try it, but those that did, loved it.   Highly recommend this place! I want more NOW!
