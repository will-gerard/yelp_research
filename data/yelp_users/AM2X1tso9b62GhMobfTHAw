Let's be honest, if you're here you are probably either going to or coming from Phoenix Municipal Courthouse.  As I have no intentions of going back to court anytime soon I probably won't be there again, but don't think that means that I'm not a fan.  The food is pretty good, the staff is friendly, it's just not quite good enough to deal with that part of downtown just to go there.

Beer selection alone and this would be a 6 star review (I know they only do 5  stars, but I've got some dirt on a few yelp employees that I would use to make it happen) Unfortunately there's other things to consider like food, and attentiveness of the waitstaff, etc.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good (love the chicken thai pizza) and the waitstaff know their stuff.  The food can be inconsistent at times and when they are busy (Friday Happy Hour) especially if you are sitting at a table it can take some time to get the staffs attention.  Not saying the food or staff is bad, it's just that it's not 5 star quality.  Now if you are there to sit at the bar and try beer that is hard to find this is your place.  The rotating list beers on tap changes frequently so unless you are there multiple times a week there's probably something new for you to try.  The bartenders are a great resource if are having trouble deciding, and if for some reason you don't find something like on draft TURN AROUND! That big cooler behind is filled with beers and if you have tasted them all then I'm jealous.  (ps try not to drool while looking at the beer cooler, it creeps people out)  And if you don't have enough time to drink all the beer you want just grab a six pack or two and bring some home.  My only complaint is that they don't always have a cask beer available on tap, but with so many other options I can't hold that against them.

Honestly, I mostly just come and get a dessert and grape Kool-aid while waiting for my Chinese food.

Everything I've ordered from here has been pretty good. I will often stop here when I don't feel like cooking and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but I'd you're doing take out that shouldn't be an issue.

I was in the mood for tacos on a Sunday and my regular taco spot was closed.  Yes there were two open taco places between my apartment and el Pollo Supremo but they are for when I'm being lazy and want tacos, not when I want good tacos.  So I put tacos into Yelp and el Pollo Supremo was the closest place that came up that I hadn't been to before.  So I drive over, step inside, and get smacked with the realization that Yelp lied to me.  I had a choice to make, eat here or go find tacos.  Tacos would have to wait another day.    In some ways I'm glad that Yelp lied to me.  I probably never would have even stopped in this plaza let alone this restaurant.  The food was great for what it was.

If I had written this review prior to an incident in September it would easily be 4 stars.  The bar tenders were awesome.  One night I was carrying around a largeish trophy (Why because I own one).  I put it on the bar to order beer and they asked me if I wanted a glass or if I wanted them to put it in the trophy.  Yes, yes I did (although they did have to pour the drink into the glass first cause the trophy was to big to properly fit under the tap).  This might not be a big deal to some, but since I've been kicked out of bars for drinking out of said trophy before and that was the first time I've ever had a bar tender be so cool about it.  Every time I've been hear the bar staff has rocked even when they are extremely busy.  Food.  I think I've eaten here once, so I'm not going to comment on it.  However I have been here when they switch from neighborhood bar mode to dance bar mode.  If you are at a table still eating at that time they have no hesitation moving your table out of the way, if you're lucky they will tell you about it before hand.  It's a good place for watching football/UFC/etc.  Could maybe use some more TV's.  Music is nothing outstanding, it's your typical dance/top 40's/etc that you would expect at any college dance bar.  Since the crowd often is college/recent grads, it fits the bar nicely.  I don't normally include bouncers in my reviews, but after what I saw the last time I was there, it's affected my opinion of the place and is the reason the place is only getting 2 stars.  If you are kicking someone out and the are leaving peacefully, there is no reason to put your hands on him, other than maybe to keep him from falling over the place.  So when I see a bouncer aggressively pushing a guy who has thrown up his hands in surrender, and in the process the bouncer knocks over a girl who has done nothing wrong, that's just not cool.  Maybe it's just me but I would think someone who works for the bar should be picking her up off the ground instead of nearly trampling her to help the bouncer who put her there while throwing out someone who is giving them no resistence on his way out.

I don't have much bad to say about Boulder's but since there isn't an ability to give a fractional star this place gets 5.  Honestly the beer selection on it's own would be enough to get 5 stars for me.  Between the rotating draft beer selection and the bottle/can list there's pretty much something for every taste.  The bar staff is knowledgeable when it comes to what they have, especially Justin, Dave, and Alex, so if you want a recommendation they won't point you in the wrong direction.  The bar is fairly laid back most of the time but can get rowdy during ASU games.  It's more of a neighborhood bar than a sports bar so there aren't a ton of tv's, but they do open early on the weekends (9 or 10am) so people do come in for early morning soccer some times.  They run different specials pretty much every day of the week.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from their food menu.  Usually I'll go with a burger and while they are all good, for my preference I usually go for the Asian Bob with a Ceasar Salad instead of the waffle fries.  The Bombay Street Dog was at one point a summer only item which has found a permant place on the menu after appearing in Phoenix New Times article "Our 10 Favorite Spicy Dishes in Metro Phoenix" last year.  If you are there for breakfast, everything I've had is good.  My recommendation would be the Chuck Norris Scramble and a Bloody Mary (it has bacon in it).

WAKA has leagues all over the Valley and I've pretty much played in all of them. Each league has it's own character, because it's the people that make the experience. If you show up and don't take the time to talk to people, you probably won't have a good time. That's on you. Your teammates are there to have fun.  The social part of WAKA is where it excels over other league in the area. In addition to having a bar sponsor for the league and player parties through out the season, there are other outings through out the year which put WAKA over the top.

Maybe I'm jaded after living in Phoenix for several years, but I was expecting more. This a place you eat at because you have time to kill before a flight, you are hungry, and you want something other than Wendy's. The beans suck, the rice is bland, and the tacos are overpriced. If you are in Phoenix on a layover, please don't judge the quality of Mexican food in the city from what they serve here. It's a shame too cause the staff here is pretty good. 1 star food, 1 star prices, 4 star staff.

Love Four Peaks beer but don't like their food, the horrible parking, or crowds at the 8th Street location?  This is the spot for you!   If you really want to eat they have food trucks that come in, and it's a different one every night so you can get something completely different on Friday than what you had on Thursday.   If you just want to have a good beer without having to deal with the Friday night crowd and most of the other good beer locations in Tempe/Scottsdale, I can't think of a better place to be.

Honestly this was probably the best tire buying experience of my life. In the past I've wandered around a store looking at nearly every tire until I found the right ones for my car. Here I walk in and 30 seconds later a friendly staff member was showing me several options. I didn't even have to tell him what size I was looking for. I told him what I was driving and he knew what size and showed me several different options. That's right options. I'm used to places only having one type of tire for my small car.  I had a headlight light that I had been meaning to get changed. The staff noticed I had the new light sitting on my passenger seat and when I explained that I didn't have the tools to do it he offered to change it for me. This really went above and beyond my expectations for customer service.  Honestly I have to say it was a great choice to go here instead of one of the chain stores I've been to in the past. I will definitely recommend them to friends who need new tires.
