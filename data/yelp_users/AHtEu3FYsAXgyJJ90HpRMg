I unfortunately purchased my fianc√©'a engagement ring here 6 months ago. I have had to send it for repair 3 times. There is a woman who works there with a very heavy accent who should never work in a position which is customer facing. She is rude, accusatory and unhelpful. This situation alone was bad enough. I didn't need to horrible service too.

We had breakfast here this morning and really enjoyed the casual vibe and good food. The chef was super flexible in customizing my order and food arrived very quick.   Also we had the cinnamon buns, they warmed them up to serve and were amazing!

We just went looking for our next car. We were extremely up front about our timeline and what we wanted from our sales rep. After having a very positive experience with him this is where it went down hill. The sales rep went to grab "more information" and brought his manager back. The manager tried to pressure us despite our very clearly defined expectations we set. Then when we said no he made us feel dumb and more or less mocked us to our sales rep in front of our face. They went from having a hole in one to not getting our business. Horrible experience here!!

I waited in the lobby and no one was there to help. When I called I spoke to a man named Steve, who was not concerned with my lack of service. Then once I confirmed someone was actually staffed to help he proceeded to ask "well, what do you need." In a less than friendly manner. I hung up on him and gave my business to chandler/kyrene. She was happy to take my money.

They call me 7 days after I've been unable to speak or eat to correct their misdiagnosis. Advise me that I do in fact have strep. I return their call to be placed on hold until after they close by a woman named Katie. Only so that she did not have to put in my script today. It's 4 days until my wedding. Hate that I was blown off and will discourage everyone I know to spend their healthcare dollars at this place.

Awesome service and great food. The host was so great he remembered my name as we were leaving on a busy Saturday night.

Solid place to eat. We always get good service and their food is unique. They have their own spin on everything which is pretty cool. It's definitely not a cookie cutter spot. Priced appropriately with a good vibe. You can come for drinks, to watch the game or for BLD. Would recommend.

This place was amazing! I was extremely happy with the wings here. We got the garlic parm and medium wings. They were out of this world. My only feedback is that the paper bag ripped when I took them out of the car and we lost a few. So if possible ask for an extra plastic bag to make sure you don't lose your food!

I was really excited to go here after buying a groupon. I received a voicemail reminder about sending an email with pictures of the dogs we wanted to paint as they were hosting pop art your pet. I attempted to call back the next day and was unsuccessful in reaching the owners. They did not respond to my voicemail or emails and I wasted 50 dollars with still no communication. Very disappointed as I had a friend go and had race reviews.
