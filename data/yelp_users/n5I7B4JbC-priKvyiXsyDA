Came here with friends last night and the experience was awesome. I really enjoy how small Spinato's feels despite how popular they are. It did take us 30 minutes to get seated, but that is to be expected on a Friday night. service was friendly and prompt and the server even gave out preggo friend a t-shirt for her baby which was incredibly unexpected. Two appetizers and a pizza were enough to satisfy the appetite of four people. The food was great like we anticipated so there were no surprises there. On top of all that they had a selection of a few Arizona wines which we definitely took advantage of. In short Spinato's scored high for me in all areas.

I have been here twice now and both times the food was good. There menu is a nice break from traditional vegan fare. I like the vibe of this place. The community style seating with the long shared table is a nice touch, but they also have smaller tables if you want to get some privacy. The food also comes out really quick so this place makes for a great lunch location if you are in the area and on a tight schedule.

This place probably has the best lunch deal in Phoenix. $5 for an awesome burger, fries, and a drink. I'll definitely return here.

This bar embodies everything Glendale truly is, which is more of a slight than anything else. Every time I some how end up at this place I always get the same experience. A mediocre night of waiting for drinks, watching people who I vaguely remember from high school, and waiting to find out where the party is afterwards. That last part should really be the point of interest for this bar since after-parties seem like a fairly common thing to do after visiting Salty's. Either way, I really wish my friends wouldn't want to come to this bar as often as they do.

This place was surprisingly authentic tasting for being in Arizona.. The food came out quick and the service was good so I will definitely be recommending this place to anyone I know.

The hummus, veggie, and focaccia bread sandwich is good. Perfect for a light lunch. I bought some of their pastries hoping that would make for good snacks/easy to grab breakfast options, but they were lack luster as best. I will definitely stop back to try their shepard's pie though.

The food here is always good, best restaurant vibe in Phoenix, and tons of rotating taps. Totally awesome stuff.
