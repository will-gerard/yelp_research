Delightful restaurant..Highly recommend. Hip& trendy with drinks and good food.  We had lettuce wraps-very spicy, nachos with blackened chicken-excellent, noteworthy, mouth watering. Enchilada dish-authentic, burger with pork belly and aioli sauce-yummy....a hick up with the kitchen, but food was impressive!  Service was ok, but management was excellent. High praise for this casual brewery.

Nice romantic view. All 6 dishes order were  seasoned to perfection, but two dishes out of twelve, slightly undercooked.     Odd beginning with a server who wouldn't take order even though I shared on a tight schedule. Problem was with lack of phone/internet service because of 56th floor of casino tower. Took me a bit of struggle to share my pre paid voucher.  Was just an odd way to start evening.  Anyway, 15/20 min.later was sorted out.  Unfortunately, just wasted some of our limited time. I really appreciated the serving staff as a whole, being extremely conscientious about our time commitment for the rest of our dinner.  Serving staff work together as a team and Overall, service was attentive and well received.  Hit of the evening : 'seared foie gras' came on two dishes.....exquisite!  Scallop dish also delicious, but needed an extra minute on the grill. Chocolate souffle was also excellent a wonderful bittersweet dark chocolate... Very smooth.  This restaurant had me in a quandary.... even though the food was perfectly seasoned, it would rate between 3 and 4, because of the ambience and some of the interaction with the staff members I bumped it up to a 4.....but,I really felt only one dish was exceptional.

Had a wonderful experience with the Sunday jazz brunch. Food was  wonderful treat with large variety of delicious dishes. Smoked salmon, buttery croissants, mouth watering waffles, cook to order omelets, cheese samplers, cute desserts, and vegan menu for the vegans in the group of meat eaters.   Service was spot on...from hostess, waiter and general servers.  All this topped off with warm inviting decor and beautiful golf course scenery and impressive waterfall. Well worth the $65 per person charge. Highlight of the weekend......(except of course the fireworks for new year)!  Must have experience!

Hotel has some improving to do. The rooms are not the calibre that is the norm for Embassy Suites. They are dingy , desperately need  updating.  Sad party is the service and employees are amazing. That's right amazing! Pleasant, conscientious, attentive and definitely make an effort to shine.  Special notice for bartender who serves food and handles a full bar single handedly, 5 stars. Special notice for John who handles the concierge services also 5 stars, also special notice for John from maintenance who was also 5 star... front staff also very attentive but I don't have the gentleman's name sorry... Anyway the employees are stellar thank you no review is literally just for the hotel property.

today I had the best experience st this business. We were running late for airport...bartender went and personal spoke to chief. Meal came out in less than 10min...and was perfect. I'd say good was a 4 star, buy the attentive, helpful service put it over the top.  Ordered pork belly with shrimp dumplings, Cobb salad with docked turkey and pork belly...both excellent. Other other at table was lunch special of brisket & pulled pork with Coleslaw. Also perfectly cooked. Great choice for excellent lunch.
