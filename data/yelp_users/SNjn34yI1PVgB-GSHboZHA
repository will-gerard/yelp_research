Love this place! Beer is cold food is decent! Big Daddy is one of the nicest guys you will meet at the bar. He always says hi to everyone and wants them to have a good time. Bartenders are always friendly. Great little neighborhood bar!

So we are staying at a local resort and called for a delivery. Of course they knew they were delivering to a resort maybe some plates or napkins at the very least some plastic forks ect. would have been nice. Now let's move on to the food TERRIBLE!!! No sweet and sour sauce for dipping for the egg rolls or sweet and sour chicken that was ordered. Seen on here biggest egg rolls around, panda has bigger then this crap. Pork fried rice bland. Even my 9 year old says why is there hardly any filling in the egg roll and she never complains about anything. Portions from Chinese food places are for the most part generous well not at this place. And the prices for the quality and portions is a joke. Could continue with more but think you get the picture. Don't waste your money on this place!

Great place! Decided last minute to book a room for the 4th of July. Decided to stay a 2nd night that it was so nice. Reasonably priced for a nice place. Wasn't overcrowded and kid friendly. Pool area is nice the staff at the front desk and valet are super friendly to deal with. Very happy that we decided to come. Went to the golf course area and watched fireworks a little far away but could see them pretty good. This is gonna be our new 4th of July spot moving forward every year. Seen some people whining about out dated decor. Decor goes very well with the surroundings not sure why the whining about it. All in all great job at the resort.

Decent size store. Of course has a good selection of the home team items. They do a pretty good job at getting other teams items in the store as well. Only thing I hate is when I see a item I like in the home team but don't carry that style in my team. To be expected though so no major complaints!

Well  I have never been put in a position like this. We have lived in the area going on 10 years have gone to the Chilis numerous times. Although it has been sometime since our last visit since there are so many options around. But this will also be my last visit not just to this Chili's but to all Chili's! I will foreword if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to stop reading. So the wife and I decided to go out here for a late dinner. I ordered a beer and we ordered wings and the new fried pickles, for apps. We get them so far so good. Food was ok nothing special but we were having fun playing the little trivia deal they have on the tables now. I order ribs, wife a burger. I get another beer as the entrees are brought to the table. I'm eating the broccoli and a piece of rib. Now the wive likes to take ranch and put some ketchup in with it stir away for her fries. (Why I have no idea but I do see people do it a lot! Lol) well this is where we find what seems to be a chunk of chicken breast (which we had no chicken breast) in the ranch cup. Looks disgusting has it been chewed up and spit in there, taking from someone's plate that was suppose to be thrown away? Well at that point I have a stomach twisting and turning. Can feel it possible coming up. Waitress is going to get the manager. In the mean time I go outside I was not trying to make something dramatic out of it in the restaurant. So I get fresh air and go back in the manager is talking to my wife at first apologizes offers new food. Straight out I tell him I'm afraid I'm gonna get sick as my stomach is turning. He says ok let me take care of this I'll be back. As I'm talking to the wife she informs me that it was the original dipping sauce that we were both using for our apps. At that point I'm done I run out of the restaurant heaving. Make it to a bush and start throwing up the food. Now I'm embarrassed as patrons are walking in and out watching me. Anyways I wait for the wife she comes out and the manager made her pay for the apps and beer! The same apps and beer that I left in there parking lot and not in a forgetful way. I had all intentions of going back in a couple weeks because I know stuff does happen. But after this and the way the manager handled the situation I will never walk into a Chilis again and it's sad because I've always liked there ribs. When my wife didn't get a receipt I told her we need to go back I wanted his name and my rec. at first he says I charge you for what you ate. I said ok the food I just throw up outside? You guys just ruined our whole dinner and I get charged for it? He was trying to defend his actions at that point all I wanted was a receipt, name, and corporate number. Then he wanted to give me my money back. I told him you just don't get it we were here to spend a lot more then that you ever dentally need the money more then I do. The last part of the conversation I was definitely heated and some f bombs and yelling started due to the manager just not getting me the info I wanted. To top it off this was suppose to be my birthday dinner with just the wife and I well the kids where with family. Thanks Chilis for ruining dinner and my birthday with the wife. Just wanted some ribs and a few cold beers!   PS I felt bad for the server that was involved she was very nice in taking care of us just wish your manager handled it correctly.

I was a business member until about a month ago for about 8-9 years. Over the years the customer service has always been blah. I've had a few issues with standing around in line with one or 2 registers open and a lot of people in line. Well that's going on theirs about 4 associates standing around that little podium thing just chatting away. I asked if maybe they could open some more registers. You would have thought I asked them to kill their mothers! So the last time I'm here the cashier has a attitude that I just don't think anyone should put up with. I'm sure she was probably having a bad day seeing it was a Saturday afternoon and it was busy. Not my fault get a new job if it's that bad. Anyways long story short the conversation gets testy. I'm pissed start yelling for this girl to just ring up the crap so I can pay and go. She continues to just try and fight with me. Finally the manager "Patrick" comes over and Believe me or not he is dressed in a "red pimp" suit, zebra print a big rimmed pimp hat and a pimp cane. Has no name tag or anything to show he's a manager. Plus it wasn't Halloween time either. Again long story short he tells me they don't need my business and tells me to leave I say not before I get my money back for my membership. So now he takes me to customer service walks me past all the people waiting in line and tells the cashier at customer service to give me my money back for my membership. Than he just walks away after he leaves me with the cashier. Unreal! I call corporate and asked if the district manager can contact me. Yeah they just have another manager in the club call me. I worked big box retail management I know how that works. How can you take any so called manager dressed in a red pimp suit seriously! I thought I was on a hidden camera show or something!

This use to be a great bar to go to. Was a fun place to go hang out any day of the week. They have pool tables prices are cheap which is good. Unfortunately over the last couple of years this place has gone downhill. It has the neighborhood dive bar atmosphere which is what I like. But this place has turned from a dive bar to just trash. Fights all the time and place just seems extra dirty. For the most part the bartenders and bouncers always seem pretty cool. Just the overall atmosphere of patrons has took a turn for the worst.

What a down slide this place has taken! Use to be a great place to go. Now the beer taste like they never clean the lines food is so so. Only good thing I'll say is they do have good sauces for the wings. Other then that went downhill fast. Even the shirts they wear now look crappy and dirty! Prices seem to have gone up and with decline of everything else how do you justify?

Wings here are great different kinds can get them naked or breaded. Pizza is really good to. If you like a thicker softer crust pizza you will love here. Personally I gotta be in the mood for this kind of pizza since I usually like a thinner crispy crust, but it is very good here as well. Have had a couple different sandwiches as well. Everything seems pretty fresh no complaints.

They did the place over a while ago since that the prices went up and the quality of food went down. You use to come here at least once every other month or so but last couple of times the food has been crappy and there prices went up. Think I'll just start ordering in and find a game for the kids to play.

Place lost its liquor license. The only thing I can say is that at least they tell you right when you walk in the door. We went to the new one on Van Buren nothing much to say about that one that's all that great either.

Burger is ok not the best not the worst. Fries hit or miss guess it depends who is cooking. Staff is usually very nice. Went there this week (Monday 6/10/13) for lunch. This time it was some white girl taking orders never seen her before working there but talk about rude and a stupid look on her face!!!! Wow!!! Ill go back but if I see her working the front ill go next door to Subway!!!! And I hate Subway!!!!

Love this place. Piano bars can be lots of fun. Go with a group sing, drink, have a good time. The last few times I've gone the crowd has been pretty small. Hope this place doesn't end up shutting down.

I've been here a couple of times. Only during early evening hours and have sat at the bar. My review is based solely on sitting at the bar and before it turns into the "club" atmosphere. Food is ok nothing special for what they serve seems a little pricey but going to west gate you should expect that. The high reviews are for the bartenders. Times I've been there the bartenders are on top of it. Make sure you have a cold one in front of you and friendly. I will say we stayed a little late one night and the nightlife crowd there seems like a bunch of douce bags. So we just left but I can see why a lot of the reviews complain about the bouncers. If you had to put up with these s&$theads hanging out here you would probably not want to put up with much crap either.

Food here is very good! Your gonna want to have a good day at the casino to afford it! Haha! But this is one of those places that what you pay for is what you get! Apps we got seafood trio and the scallop app. Very good but not very big portions. If your with more then 2 people you may want to ask how much food is on the apps so everyone can try a little. I got the big steak it was cooked perfect med-rare and was delicious! Other entree was fish which they liked very much. Side dishes were also great. Asparagus was cooked to perfection and very tasty. Service was good as well. This is the type of place that you want to take your time having dinner. They don't rush you, this is not a turn and burn place. If your in a rush then I wouldn't suggest this place. If your a cheapskate and don't like to spend money I wouldn't suggest this place. With that in mind be prepared to open the wallet and have a great meal!

The service was great, atmosphere was great. That's where the two stars come from. Food was lacking. We got the cheese tray as a app. Seemed like if there was a display to show what they were serving that's the plate we got. The prosciutto was very fatty and had a clump of what I would say fatty grease in the middle. For entrees we got the halibut and NY strip steak. Both were cook great but just lacked flavor. Seemed as if there was no seasoning on the either. Strip was suppose to have a Demi glaze over it which couldn't tell at all. The middle of the steak was cool great which I asked for med/rare but the outside of it was charred to the point that it smelt burnt with every bite. I didn't even eat half of it. My dog loved it though! Got wild mushrooms with the steak. Again flavorless tossed in a pan with olive oil that's about it. I honesty felt like I asked for everything plain due to some diet restriction or something which of course I didn't. We also got asparagus as a side. Very strange the top layer was not bad at all but when you got to the bottom of the dish it was very gritty. Kinda like getting sand in your mouth. Normally I would have said something but since we already had a groupon I didn't. Just didn't want to look like the cheap ass coming in with coupons than complaining about the meal. It's to bad I was looking forward to it from other reviews. I hate to say this but since they are closed Monday and Tuesday's all I could think of is we were just getting the crap left over from the weekend.

Wow I was really surprised how bad the food was with all the good reviews. We got sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken and the app for 2. My GF who generally likes most food didn't like the orange chicken at all. I tried it didn't care for it myself either. Would prefer panda over here. The sweet and sour chicken was not edible the sauce was bland and the chicken looked and tasted like it was overcook and cooked in old oil. As for the app plate not much better. Beef on a stick tasted like the fried shrimp it came with again very bland. The one thing I will say is the pork fried rice wasn't to bad. But they won't let you upgrade steamed rice to pork fried rice so had to get it separate. Even asked to upgrade for a charge and was told no. All for nothing won't waste my hard earned cash here again.

Great place. Love this place for sprits. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is that I think Bevmo is better for the beer selection. But total wine is better for sprits selection. I'm not a wine drinker so don't have a opinion either way on that.

Not bad ordered a few times in the last month or so. Only thing I would say is its not consistent. Have gotten the pizza and wings everytime. Pizza can be under or over cooked. When they get it right it is very good. Wings are same way sometimes over cooked sometimes under cooked. I will say that it's not as good as NYPD but for the price to NYPD it is a steal. Delivery seems to be fast as well. Updated have gotten food still after this and the consistency has improved!!! Update to 4 stars!!!

So done with this place! Just has progressively got worse and worse! Since when do you put sauce on a pizza that's made for pasta? Chunky sauce??? Wings were dry and over cooked almost chocked on them! Got two pizzas one had a ton of cheese on it compared to the other one. That was my issues with this place never know what your gonna get! After tonight I know they will never get another dime of my money and thank god I won't get awful food from this place!

Don't know what took me so long to try the food here. By far this is my new favorite fast food burger. They make the food fresh and bring it to your table. Only thing I'm mad about is at myself for not trying the food here sooner. I always thought it was kinda like a "Denny's" atmosphere. It is not at all! Fast food burger at its best!

Been here a few times have had breakfast and lunch. Food is always good. The burgers are my favorite the burger meat you can taste the freshness haven't had bad food here yet. The wait time can vary. If your in a rush I'd try something else. Only real complaint is the chairs aren't very comfortable.

For a busy place they are top of there game. Food was just so so for me. The burger has this crust around it that kinda hurts the gums and roof of your mouth when you bite into. Pretty sure it was the cheese the melts over. Get by the crusty part and the burger does taste fresh. If you like skinny shoestring crunchy fries then you will love these. For me not so much it was like eating warmed up potato sticks from a can. I did see managers and maybe a owner going around asking what they thought they never did come by our table prob since most of the fries and 1/3 of the burger was sitting there untouched. If it was the owner he was sitting outside playing with his cell phone more then asking people what they thought and it was lunch time. Personally I'll stick with Five Guys. Little more expensive but you get what you pay for with Five Guys!!!!

Since one doesn't come up for AZ Mills I'm putting it here. $10 for pasta with meatballs and a drink. Than they have the nerve to charge 75 cents for a refill. When everyone else gives you a free one. The girl at the register had the nerve to tell me to go next door and use the burger places one are you f-ing kidding me? Joke!

We were in the area just doing a little shopping. We went in to have a beer since we live in the area and have never actually gone in. Happy we did. We decided since it was close to dinner to just grab a bite. Menus not big nothing special didn't bother us at all. We got Buffalo Wings and Burgers. Food was very good. We got there around 6-7 not really sure of time. Wasn't very busy. Filled in a little as we stayed. They had a live band we decided to stay and see them. We only stayed for the 1st set unfortunately it wasn't very good. That's the only thing that kept it from 5 stars. Now we did only stay for the 1st set so the night may have gotten better. The music they played before the band went on and after there set was country music which you would expect and we were happy with that. Some of these places try to market as country music bars and play a lot of hip hop and what not. Not this place which we were happy about. We will go back for sure just hope the live music is better since I love seeing live music and seems that this is a great place to see a live band for a bar.

I'll tell ya I've been to a lot of bars boozing, drinking so on and so forth! Even been in in the business! I've never seen a manager like Jarrett run his butt off and help a staff like him! He works just as hard if not harder then his staff! I was amazed to find out he was a manager! He wants to make sure that everyone in his establishment is having fun and he does a great job! Kudos to Jarrett and his staff just because of him I will be a customer for life to wiskey!

Be aware!!! Bad customer service!!! If you do go try to get one of the reps from Texas as they seemed to know more since they are here helping with the new openings. Also beware of all the bogus promos they offer. A lot of bait and switch. Then be real careful when you sit down to pay. They seem to like to jack up the prices hoping you won't notice. Pretty sure that's due to the reps making commission. Had 2 different experiences 1 time bought something was a so so experience. And the 2nd time walking out on purchasing 6 grand worth of furniture due to horrible customer service and baiting and switching. Also FYI once your in the store and a rep introduces themselfs they follow you worse then a used car salesman. Which I understand they want to make money but the issue is when you ask a question they have no clue how to answer it.

Not impressed at all. For a casino steakhouse the prices are very reasonable. As far as the food not very good. I'm not sure if the chef taste the food when it comes out but he or she should start! Cocktail sauce that come out with our seafood tower was over powering with horseradish, which is a understatement. If you have a clogged nose I suggest having some. It will clear that right up. The one thing I will say is the waitress did tell us that there was a lot of horseradish in it. I figured ok a little bite to it I prefer it like that, but whoa you couldn't eat it! The ahi tuna looked and tasted a little suspect. They did substitute some shrimp for it. Crab legs are split and cold. Problem is think they keep them on ice. The bottom part of the crab was literally frozen. Ok on to soup and salad. Prob best part of the meal. Entrees there was 4 of us 2 of us are pretty picky so surprise surprise of course we didn't like it. But the 2 that weren't didn't like there's either. Prime rib was tuff not like a prime rib should be. Even the au jus came out luke warm at best and flavorless. Fish had no flavor. One got NY Strip and asked for Med-well (which I think ruins it). That came out charred on the outside and med-rare. The sides weren't even good. Asparagus overcooked and way to much lemon. The "smashed" red potatoes temp wise were closer to the cold side with no flavor. I will say the service wasn't terrible and the manager did take his time to stop by and talk with us. Overall wouldn't bother wasting my time there nor would I suggest you waste your time or money, even if the casino is going to comp it!

Have lived in this area for close to 10 years now. This by far is the worst KFC I've been to. Quality of food is always inconsistent and usually on the bad side. Take the extra time and go to the one on Dysart and Van Buren.

Great place! Guys know there stuff if they don't know they will do everything to get the answer. We were running late on a Friday afternoon and needed to pick up some items they are closed on the weekend the waited for us to get there so we could get what we needed. Not only did the wait for us when we were there no hurry and go they got everything we needed to do our job for the weekend. Very reasonably priced and great service!

Not bad. We drove by on a Saturday thinking the line would be out the door. Since it finally wasn't. We decided to give it a shot. One thing to point out to people that are not use to ordering by the weight of food don't let the prices fool you. Even though most meat items are in the 6-7 dollar range you will be paying a lot more. When you see what 1/2 pound actually looks like you will most likely want more even for the lighter eaters. We got a few different items since it was the 1st time we have been. Jalapeño sausage was very good, baby backs good, cutters choice brisket was good as well. Tried a small portion of green chile stew didn't want to get to much with the weather being hot as I feel it's great for winter, anyhow it was very good as well. Potato salad wish we just got a bigger portion of that. We for the most part love cole slaw none of us cared to much for it. Only bad thing I would say is the waiting we got right into the doorway to where the railing starts and still took us about 30-40 mins to order. If I come here and the wait is out the door no way I'll wait. It was good but not worth the wait good. Overall pretty good BBQ place. Don't go on a first date here cause you better plan on getting dirty!!!! Lol

Very disappointed. Hate when a place first opens and everything is nice and clean all the time. BBQ sauces full with no dried on BBQ at the tip. I always say if they keep the place running like this they will do good. So this is our 5-6 time here and you can just sere rethink slowing declining right down to the customer service. To start when we went to order which was about 5pm on a Sunday we were told they were out of ribs! Really? Thought it was a joke. Lady looked at me like I was crazy when I said how does a place that only serves BBQ run out of ribs? No response not even a sorry. So couldn't order what we really wanted! Ok whatever move on. Go to the table and there filthy BBQ sauces half full at best dirty sticky bottles with the dried up BBQ sauce on the spout. I'll just stay away for a while and maybe try a ways down the road again to see if they get there act together. I know my wallet will like that!

Wow! I grew up in Boston like to think I know a thing or two about seafood. This place is great food tasted fresh just like advertised. Fish was flaky and tasty no smelly fish here! (When you eat fish it should not smell like fish fyi means not fresh at all!) scallops great, clams fat and meaty! Can't wait till they have the Beer flowing it will be a Friday night staple!

Not sure what it is with this particular location but they just can't get it right here. I like El Pollo Loco overall but this location is bad. Like a lot of reviews chicken dried out over cooked. We have tried a few times since this one opened thinking it would get better but just doesn't.

Another place to add to the list of the West Valley when they opened everything was pretty good. Been here about 4-5 times if anything got worse. Went in and they are out of bread! Yes, your eyes are right out of bread!!! Sounds like good management once again! You can bet I won't be running to come back anytime soon. When you can't have a item for the only thing you sell why waste your time and money for them. Not like they offer a coupon for trying to spend money. To top it off a customer seen us sanding in line and he's the one to tell us they ran out of bread team members didn't even acknowledge us right away to tell us. Guess they were all ready to go home.

So I decided to give it another shot. This location is garbage. Went with the philly steak and cheese has onions and peppers on it. So it's a little steak and all cheese, onions, and peppers. Just nasty. All you can taste is the cheese and bread. I'm sure everything is portion out, but seriously with a drink for $11 dollars it's a joke. I had two bites of my soggy cheesy sub and threw it away! Love throwing my hard earned money away! Be better off going to subway. I'm done with this place when it first opened the quality was great now all they care about is quantity. Go to Jimmy Johns much better, and you get the same size sub for a couple bucks less. Only bright spot was at least they had bread this time to serve subs! Last time I went in they didn't even have that. Time before that no white bread!

Ordering process is somewhat slow. They make the pizzas for each person. There were a few people in front of us and seemed like it took a while. If your in a hurry and this place has a line I would recommend somewhere else. Other wise if you have the time it is worth the wait. Staff is very friendly. One price no matter what you want on your pizza is pretty cool also. Once you get threw the ordering process the food does come out pretty fast. It all looks very good and the taste is very good also. Everything taste very fresh.

I've lived in the area for a long time always drove by and said I gotta try it out. Finally did and glad I did. Great place to have out have some drinks and food. I've had chicken wings and burgers both great. Service is great. When you first walk in you can tell that there are some regulars at the bar that kinda look at you like WTF you doing in my place but it's mostly grumpy old man.

Heard a bang come from the garage the night before no idea where it came from until we tried to open the garage door the next day. A spring had busted and couldn't open the door at all. Now it's a Sunday at about 8-9am. Did a little research to see how to fix it and pretty much all the research said this really isn't your DIY project. So Armand responses to my thumbtack request. Not only does he fix it he fixed it same day within a few hours. He gave me a quote based on what I told him and some pictures. He came out said yup no problem. I didn't even have to move all the crap in my garage. Armand fixed it in about a half hour with no same day fee or it being a Sunday fee. Highly recommend you give them a call if your having garage door issues.

Food was great. Staff was great as well as the atmosphere. Server told us that the sauces were on the hot side so we went with medium. Found the heat to really not be there. I think I read in another review that it's very oily which I found to be true. We had 3 different bags of food and got the same flavor and heat in all of them. Didn't find the 3 different bags to be very consistent with the flavors or heat. Now I'm not complaining about it cause it was good but I like consistency when I go to places.
