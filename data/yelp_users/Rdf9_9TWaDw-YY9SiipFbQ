I have nothing bad to say about this place, that's why they get 5 stars! I love little local family owned places like this, and walking into it, you feel like you're in Japan because you see places like this all over there. Korea too, but this is Japanese food. I like how people complain about it being silent in there, but if you've been to Japan, many places are like that there especially in the smaller towns. It's actually kind of nice. It's only awkward if you make it so. Just saying.   You go in and sit down, the owner comes to take your order, and is straight to the point but very nice. We got him talking a lot at check out but I will get to that later.   I ordered the chicken katsu curry dinner, and they give you so much food for your money. Huge plate of curry, delicious and rich, with a side salad, gyoza, and more. I recommend getting a melon cream soda, or even Boba. Yum yum. It didn't take long to get our order at all as well.   At check out, we had to go up to the counter to pay and they bank through Chase so they have a chip reader and swiper via Chase bank. It also offers to add a tip and you can do by percentage or exact tip price you want to add. The owner invited us to Matsuri Festival and said he will have a food booth there, and really opened up to us after that. So cute.

So I'm not usually into Chain Restaurants but I must say, this location always does a great job when I come in. I can't help but love the decor, it reminds me of Vegas.... Don't ask why. I don't know.   The hostesses were all nice, all three of them. Went on a Saturday afternoon with my BFF. We sat in the patio where they have fans and it's mostly covered.   Ordered the Skinny Cosmo which was surprisingly tasty! They put just the right amount of juice and liquor in it. Our waitress was very attentive, and super sweet. Our silverware and napkins were pretty stained and she wouldn't stop apologizing. She was cute. They brought bread out pretty quickly. We order and shared three appetizers: Shrimp Spring Rolls, Asian Lettuce Wraps, and their tomato basil flatbread thing. All three were pretty good except for the lettuce wraps... They were extremely salty. The rolls came with a peanut sauce and a soy type orangey sauce. For it not being a Vietnamese place, it was not too shabby!   I didn't get dessert this time but I usually go for the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Yummmyy. Waitress brought out our check at perfect timing, not too early and not too late. Yay! :)

Pizzeria Bianco! Delizioso!  The pizza here... Like nothing I've tried. The restaurant setting... so cool and hip yet romantic and city-like. I'm glad to say us Phoenicians have this local spot, which is located in the Heritage Square in DT Phx. I always love going to the DT Phx area and trying this place out just topped off the mood of the evening for my date and I! I saw this area while at the Matsuri Festival back in February, and I told myself I wanted to come back to sit on the patio of one of the restaurants in Heritage Square... When my date brought me here, I had no idea the location.   They have fun lights that string across the patio connected to the actual restaurant building. It's the perfect spot on a perfect-weathered day, especially at night when those twinklies light up the area out front. The hostess was pretty friendly, halfway wheeling around on a scooter thing, looking like she had a broken leg - but that didn't stop her, she was full of energy! We were greeted by our server who was very helpful and friendly. He recommended a few pizzas to try and brought us some bread with our waters. I ordered a Moscato (as usual lately) that was just perfectly sweet and buttery with a tiny hint of bubbly. My date ordered a "Very Dry" Ginger Ale that came in a glass bottle that I've never heard of, and it was exactly as described... Very dry! But still very good if you like Ginger Ale!  We ordered the Handmade Mozzarella Salad that went great with the Sonny Boy pizza. The salad being not too overpowering really brought out the taste and flavors in the pizza! And who can go wrong with some greenery eats in their life?? The server was on top of everything, filling up empty water glasses and checking up on us. Come time to wrap things up, we didn't have room for dessert and the server was prepared just in case and placed our check down for us to pay. The price was very reasonable considering I also ordered a glass of wine. Our pizza was boxed up and ready to go by the time we paid and we didn't have to wait forever.  Overall, with the ambiance, good food, great location?.... These guys will definitely see me again!  Update: The leftover pizza I was able to reheat a few days later and still was so delish :)

I have no complaints for this place. They have ruined me for coffee anywhere else, they're so delicious. I have yet to try the food, but I have heard great things from many people. I had the Velvet and they can serve to go or in a ceramic coffee cup to stay. They had a cute design waiting for me. The line setup was confusing, but I eventually figured it out. They have delicious looking desserts that I must try next time in! They have a lot of outdoor seating, a good amount of indoor but it's always so packed. The parking isn't too big of an issue unless it's super busy. There's a small parking lot and street parking as far as I know, so goodluck!! A must try - great ambiance, great coffee, very hipster, friendly staff, clean restroom, and somewhat hidden in the rear entrance :)

I come from Orange County where Korean BBQ places in OC and LA don't come up short and I feel I have a pretty dang decent grasp on Korean BBQ, so finding a place since moving to Phoenix for KBBQ makes me oh-so-happeee. I've tried a couple other KBBQ places in the Glendale/Phoenix area, and this location (Ohya) is the only one that seems to have a good fun atmosphere, bek se ju, and all-you-can-eat nights. Although Cali places have the all-you-can-eat every night, I'm not understanding why places in Phoenix haven't adapted this concept (and for $20 per person at that and free green tea ice cream!).  Anyways, the first table we sat at - the grill wasn't working so the server moved my friend and I to a working grill to eat BBQ (not a problem). She was really nice about it and got us waters right away. The pricing is a bit much when they serve such a small amount of meat when ordering off the BBQ menu. We ordered brisket and bulgogi and the brisket would suuuper fatty. I've never seen such fatty meat. I felt like saying "want some meat with that fat?", and considering how much fat there was instead of meat, it shouldn't be priced what it is! The tofu soup I ordered at medium spicy and it was very sour and I never got an egg with it! I won't be ordering that again...  I can tell they cannot accommodate large parties, because they moved two different groups around to different tables and had to squeeze them in - and many of their grills weren't working. It was like playing a game of musical chairs & tables. This location is right across from ASU West campus tucked in a little shopping strip. We didn't have any problems with service, except a few times we couldn't get a hold of our server to order more drinks but it's understandable when a flood of peeps come rushin' in. Overall during this visit, service was good, the side dishes were good mainly the spicy cucumber and kimchi, the bulgogi was good, but the prices were a bit much and the meat was really fatty.   UPDATE: So on 12/8/15, I went to their all-you-can-eat bbq and sushi night. Let me just say, I will never return again for the Korean bbq portion, maybe if I just want all-you-can-eat sushi. They charge $21.99 per person for just sushi, and only $25.99 for bbq and sushi per person. They limit what you order for bbq each round and they only give you 90 minutes from the first moment you place your first order. Once you reach the 90 minute mark, you're no longer allowed to order anything else. During regular bbq nights, they give you six sides and lettuce or salad, but for all-you-can-eat they don't give you lettuce/salad and only give you three small sides (no fish cake, no potato, no bean sprout). The meat portions are half the size of regular bbq (which was already a small portion to begin with). Our server Brian was super nice though...he hooked us up with a salad lol.  If you want to order nigiri sushi, they only bring you one piece per order and they limit how many things you can order per round. Also, they charge $10.00 for a bottle of soju. It was the most disgusting soju I've ever had and I've had some pretty bad soju. Stick with beer, sake, or hot sake. Lastly, if you don't finish everything you order, they charge you extra on top of what you're already being charged per plate that you don't eat. (This is understandable for all-you-can-eat sushi, but not bbq. That's ridiculous.)   Recommendation for the restaurant: Go to K-town in Los Angeles and get some pointers on how to run a Korean BBQ restaurant - or even Korea where they have an entire buffet and charge $20-25 per person and you can pick whatever you want from the buffet as many times as you wish. Also, please stop buying such fatty meat. I felt like that's all I was eating was fat instead of actual meat (bulgogi, brisket, galbi). And stop charging $10.00 for crappy soju. I can get soju at a street vendor in Seoul for cheaper than that and it tastes better. Also, have an option for people who just want all-you-can-eat bbq... if LA and OC can do this daily and give larger portions and not cut the sides down in half for only $20.99 per person, I'm sure you can too. Just saying.

I come in very early in the morning during the week, and in the early afternoon on the weekends - and the girls that are always working are so awesome! Once they've seen you a few times, they remember you every time after! They used to remember my drink until I started changing it up on them =)  I will just say that I've gotten a Three-pump vanilla cappuccino with extra foam from here, and they've made it the best I've had from any other Starbucks. It was so good I drank it so fast when I normally sip on it slowly. They also know how many times I've checked in here, even on Facebook *giggle*.  This location gets extremely busy because it's in a popular shopping center and it starts right around 6:45am up to 9am. I've seen the line going out the door so I'm glad I get there around 5:45am! I like this location the best not because of the coffee, but the customer service from the early morning girls makes it a great experience every time!

Myself, my mom, and my sister all come here for our cuts and color and all the ladies here are fantastic! I have gotten my hair done by Lindsay and Michelle and they're so sweet, fun to talk to, and most importantly they are great with me hair! I just worked with Michelle before this review and she was gentle washing my hair, she was able to answer my questions about staying my bangs, and cut my hair exactly as I wanted! She recommended thickening shampoo and conditioner from Big Sexy Hair that works great and volumizes my hair. I've paid a lot of money at high ends salons and this place treats me the same and does just as good of a job for a much cheaper price. I highly recommend it!

This is my go to sushi spot when I don't want to spend a fancy amount on getting my sushi fix. The hot sake isn't the greatest but it's good enough! I have never had any complaints about their food or service.   This location used to be a very small room, but they have gotten so busy that they were able to buy our the location next to them and expanded out. Perfect!   This place is Korean owned. It's always busy, but never too busy, and they have outside seating. The service is great and always very friendly. They have their own specialty rolls, and I love them all so I recommend trying them out. Nope, not just one. All! Always clean, restrooms are always clean, and the restaurant never smells like bad fish. If you're looking for a good, laid back sushi local sushi place.. This is a good one!

This review has been a long time coming. I go here with my girlies when we are craving a margarita and fundido. That is THE only reason why we choose this place. Other than location as it is closer to us. Their margaritas are okay, I usually get the Pom Pom. But lately it's rare when we get a good glass of it. Lately it's very syrupy or too sour.   Last night was a good example of why I give this place two stars. My girls and I get there at 9:30pm, we are ignored by the waitress for fifteen minutes. She saw us first arrive and continued to serve her other tables. After fifteen minutes, my friend gets up and walks to the table behind us where the server is chatting personally with and asks if we could get service. She comes to our table and asks if we wants menus. She brings us menus. Ten minutes later, it's been 25 minutes now that we have been here. We have no drinks, just menus. She finally comes back over after we flag her down again. We ask for a manager and put in an order. It's now past 10pm and we are hungry, and there's no other place open around to go to if we leave.   Manager comes over and gives us ten reasons and excuses as to why we probably weren't served within reasonable time. Finally he apologizes and says he'll take care of some things for us on our tab. Our server comes over with our drinks and finally apologizes. Okay, no problem you're forgiven. The night goes well after that... We order a second round of drinks and they're disgusting. We send them back and ask for our tab. The waitress apologizes. The manager comes over and says he took a drink off for each of us to make up for waiting.... I tell him "You mean the one drink we sent back... and didn't drink?" (We only ordered two total drinks each.) He says "damnit", walks away, and never does anything to take care of us.   Every time I come here it takes so long to get service. But the fundido is delicious that we can't resist coming once every six months.... after we have forgotten how bad the service usually is.

Hip. Romantic. Cool.  I've been to True Foods in SoCal, but coming to this location has been the best experience so far. My date and I came in around 7:30PM during the week and it was filled up pretty nicely. We were greeted at the door by the hostess and she was very sweet and cheerful. We asked to be seated outside and were seated immediately. Only a few minutes go by and we're already being greeted by our server who was so nice and upbeat, and funny! He got us water and asked us if we had ever been there before and recommended some of his faves.  I ordered the Kale & Avocado Dip that has pink grapefruit in it and the Medicine Man Refresher. My date ordered the Seared Tuna Wrap and the Hangover Rx (except he wasn't hungover)(I don't think...). When the server was telling us about the Seared Tuna Wrap, he was going over the Seared Fish and ended up getting his words backwards and called my date Seared... instead of Sir :) So for the rest of the night my date was Seared, instead of Sir. He was fun!  We got our meals out pretty quickly, and everything was so delicious! His (my date's) dish came with Quinoa that wasn't too saucy or over-abundant, it was JUST right. The tuna tasted fresh. I highly recommend trying out the Kale & Avocado dip though, it comes with chips but you can eat this dish with or without them and it's still great! (Although with the chips it makes it that much more wonderful.) The ambiance of the restaurant was very chill and hip, and the patio was a great place to relax and enjoy the weather - well, since it wasn't hot out!  We will return again, healthy fooood!

Close to my work, always friendly staff in the early morning hours, quick to produce my coffee fix, and doesn't disappoint. The location is usually pretty clean, along with the restrooms. It can get pretty packed in here due to so many office buildings in the area, but they do their best to get through it as quickly as possible. I've seen them allow a couple dogs inside so that's cool.   I usually get a Skinny Vanilla Latte with extra foam and sometimes spoil myself with one of their delicious chocolate croissants. If you want a chocolate croissant, ask for it extra warm. Trust me it's much better that way! Otherwise sometimes the chocolate inside isn't melted all the way. The Spinach Feta Wrap is pretty good too. They have new menu drinks that I've heard are pretty good!   I recommend this location for your Starbucks fix if you're in the area!

I have been lucky to not hit a line every time I've come here, it always start building out the door after I've ordered. Their flavors are so delicious and their staff is always so friendly! Only thing is that it is always sooooo cold inside, but perfect for when it's hot out! It's located in a very hip, very upcoming area and I love coming here. The ambiance and décor of this place is like an old-style candy store - it's so cute! Not only do they sell ice cream and such, they also sell candies.  Must try flavors are Guiness (must be 21+ to order, or even try), all of their holiday flavors are fantastic and spot on, Vietnamese Coffee (yummm). For sundaes I've tried the Strawberry Shortcake that was pretty true to taste. For Lil' Freezies I've tried the Salted Caramel which was delicious and actually had a good mixture of salty versus sweet flavors. Peanut Butter Cup is a must for peanut butter lovers!   I would recommend getting one of their ice creams served on a cone; all of their cones are so good. Definitely one of my upcoming favorite ice cream spots!

Wow. This place I'm definitely returning to. Very unique in its own right. A must for dinner, early to mid evening. The setting is a little darker on the back patio but it's too pretty not to sit out there. Very hip and very romantic feel. I think it's an old firehouse. They offer two unisex restrooms that are very clean. There's a big firepit on the back patio that I think you can reserve. Oh... Their food?? Yeah let me get to that :)   Their bruschetta I was NOT expecting. They're huge!! We tried all of them and all of them were amazing. Especially the one with tomato, brie, and olives. Yummm. I asked our waitress, who took a little while to get to us but it was a bit busy, what light sweeter red wine she recommended and said to get one of the light Pinot Noir's. Can't remember the name... Bridge Water maybe? I got the Brie Soup, which was a bit Salty but soo delicious. My date ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and that is a MUST try. I was jealous.   And. The. Chocolate. Creme Brulee.  Good, fun service? Check!  Yummy drinks? Check!  Delicious food? Check!  Delicious sweets? Check!  Music? Very good and very fitting!  Pretty fair pricing? Check! (Except maybe the wine, $9 a glass to start is a bit up there...)

Had such a blast going through! The actors/cast are so good at what they do, they get me every time and I don't scare too easily!! The sets look so professional, and the prices are perfect for it being such an awesome amusement site! Great haunted house, would recommend it!!

"I'll Be Back!"  Twirl is located in a small shops/business plaza near Central and Camelback and this place is very cute. There were a handful of customers that were chilling there eating froyo. The décor is cute, they have a very old old TV sitting in the corner that doesn't really have anything playing on it. They have some tables and chairs inside and outside, and I think some couch-type furniture.  We asked Tasha (sp.) if we could get some sample cups. They were out, but she said to just grab a regular cup and a spoon and just try through all the samples and to throw out the cup after. She was really nice. They had Low-Fat, Non-Fat, Sorbet, lots of choices. I tried Peanut Butter, Chocolate Sorbet, Watermelon Sorbet, Banana Cream, and Cake Batter. I really liked the Cake Batter, it wasn't too heavy or too strong - just the right amount of flavor. I mixed it with Strawberry, it was a good mix! They have a lot of choices for toppings, from fruit to fruity pebbles. The prices are very reasonable for Froyo as well.  Tasha was really sweet and very helpful. She offered us a punch card and even gave an extra punch mark! I give four stars because of how good this place is, location is great, service was excellent... the counter tops were a little dirty tho. All-in-all, I will return!

What a hidden gem! This place was fantastic and will be seeing me again. First, I walk in with my date who has been here before, and I see a very clean and trendy place. I'm a superhero lover by nature, and there's fun comic pictures all along the walls. I'm not sure if they're made locally but they're really cool! They also have four really awesome ninja turtle drawings on the wall towards the restrooms. So cool!   Anyway, I locate the flavors on the menu, and they have quite a few. I choose honeydew flavor snoh, and ask the worker at the register what goes best with it. He recommends processed milk syrup and almond cookies. So I order it, prices are pretty reasonable, and the cashier was friendly... It doesn't take long  to come out even though there was a little line. And the dish.... Was delicious! My date got a taro one with black sesame and almond cookies and he let me try. That was so delicious too!   I highly recommend trying this little place out. As I said, it'll be seeing me again!

I came here on a mission for Duck Fat Fries. I come from SoCal, where a handful of restaurants there have BOMB Duck Fat Fries, and after moving here, I've been misssssssing me some Duck Fat Fries.... And though Salty Sow was unique about it with their long-minute cooked/poached eggs... They were a bit disappointing. There wasn't that unique Duck Fat flavoring.. They honestly just tasted like fries with egg. Darn! I'm sad again!   Anyways... Walking into this restaurant, it's pretty chill on the outside. Walk inside, it's pretty busy for a week night. The patio is a must-sit unless it's too hot. I really like this place's patio. Lights, plenty of seating... and they had a guy singing - who was rather good. He definitely set the kick-back mood. This place seemed like it could be a mix between Hip but Romantic/Classy-esque. I can't really pinpoint it.  I ordered the Moscato which was okay - I was hoping for a little more sweet and carbonated, but it was still good. The Chicken Thighs were tasty, especially with their "smashed potatoes". My date ordered the Candied Pork Belly - that's a must try as it was very tasty.  Overall, the service was really good and everyone was really nice. The manager came by to see how we were doing. The restaurant is definitely a good sight for the eyes... Ahhh them duck fat fries though! Still... I give four stars.

Eight employees behind the salad soup bar, only one working. What a nice first impression the first time I came here.   Honestly, I don't have many good things to say about this place. I will say that they do have good food. That's why they get some stars. But... The customer service isn't good and they offer small portions for the price they charge. Don't get me wrong, the pricing is fair for the portion of other things except salads. I ordered a Strawberry Harvest with Chicken Salad and I saw the girl put a very small scoop of chicken on it... meaning  she didn't fill to scoop and it was all small pieces of chicken. I said something and she said I would be charged $1.79 extra for more chicken. I told her she didn't even fill one scoop, how was that fair for what I'm already paying? She said "Well that's just out price for portions."   I have had a few friendly employers here but I've gotten a lot of attitude from employees more and they make it look like it's so hard to work... I've been here a few times because it's convenient and I like the salads and soups... But honestly, they've officially lost my business.   If you don't care for good service and being cheated out of proportions, I would recommend their salads that have fruit and the cauliflower soup is delightful.

This sushi spot definitely has its perks. I think a Korean couple owns it and they're always in there working! The female owner is verrrry sweet. They did just hire some service staff, which I feel need to be trained a bit more (sometimes very slow at service, sometimes not as attentive, sometimes very brief and not as personable...depending on who the server is), but everyone is friendly. This is my go-to spot for sushi; it's very close to where I live that I could walk if I need to. They offer really great prices for lunch too - 2 Sushi Rolls for $8.95 and 3 for $10.95! (I think it's $10.95!)  During this review, I was there for lunch with a date. There were a small handful of people dining inside the restaurant, and a couple outside. The male owner greeted us immediately upon walking in. We were told by a quiet female server to sit where we wished to. We ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Yellowtail Roll, Crunchy Tempura Roll, and Edamame. The Edamame always comes out still steaming, which I loooove. It's pretty flavorful and they usually don't put too much salt. The rolls came out in a very timely fashion and they tasted very fresh - flavorful.   Our glasses were always full - we had water. Only thing the server forgot was to bring us two small plates since we were sharing a few rolls. She did, however, notice we liked using a lot of Wasabi and brought us a big scoop of more! She was sweet. I said thank you in Korean to the male owner upon leaving, and every time he's always so surprised and happy to hear me say it haha.  Great prices, good service, clean restaurant, and always fresh, good sushi! What more can you ask for??  PS: Try their Orgasm Roll... it's delish :)

So I'm a regular here now, and I have to say... My last four star rating was soooo wrong! This little family-operated place is definitely underrated. Shinji is the male owner who is always seen on most nights working the sushi bar. He says hi and bye and thank you to Every Single Person or Group that walks in and out the door. How awesome is that? He genuinely cares about his customers and the owners and staff, and the food, are the biggest reasons I always come here.   His wife Lynn helps out around the restaurant, assisting servers with table and she's always so friendly and easy to remember you, if you actually talk to her. She's always happy to hear me speaking Korean and always compliments me on it, so that makes me feel special. Daja is one of the main servers here and she's always super friendly and on top of things! She's learning Korean just like me so it's fun conversing with her!   On to the food... They have an assortment, mainly Japanese and Korean. The reason? The owners are Japanese and Korean! They have sushi, sake, Udon, Ramen, Bento boxes... and then they have Bulgogi bowls (which are sooo delish) and other Korean options. It's mostly Japanese tho. The pricing is not bad and they have $5 Sake Bombs everyyy day. They're closed every Sunday which kind of stinks but I'm glad for them they take a day off!

PPP is a pretty chill spot. They weren't very busy when I came in for dinner with a few friends. We were served almost right away so that's great. We actually had to move to a bigger table and the server was very accommodating.   I would have to say the pizza here is almost... homemade tasting which is a good step away from the usual pizza restaurants! They have pizza, salads, beer, appetizers, etc. We ordered the Date Me pizza and the Red, White, & Blue Salad. The Salad was spot on. It was delicious, a MUST try if you like fruit on your salad! The dressing wasn't too overpowering, which I usually have issues with when ordering salads at restaurants. The Date Me pizza was different. It was good, but not great. It did have a different kind of taste to it, so I would say to give it a try, especially if you like dates!  The actual setting of the restaurant is cool, they had TVs around the restaurant especially the bar where they were playing different sports on all. They have fun patio seating which I didn't get to try but will for sure next time! The whole area is somewhat of a "San Fran" feel but Phoenix-style. Service was really nice and the restrooms were clean - gotta love that!

I don't even know where to begin! I don't like to really write bad reviews.... I think this is my first one! Coming from usually staying in the nicer hotels such as MGM or Caesar's, this was by far the worst Vegas hotel experience ever.   FYI: They're currently renovating, so I'm sure once the entire process is complete, it may do some justice! There's a lot of construction so it's very confusing to find your way to the check-in area if you're driving in.  Okay.... FIRST: The upsides! It's really really cheap to stay! No resort fees! It's right on the strip as well, so location is good! Housekeeping ladies are friendly! The guys in Valet and Taxi Service are friendly! Beds were clean and no bugs/stains! Free parking!  SECOND: The downsides myself and group experienced: Long wait time to check in, took 30+ minutes, and the check-in lady was very dry. Interior on many floors such as hallways are disgusting. There weren't any ice machines available to us. The pillows were either extremely lumpy, uneven, or hard as a rock. The rooms smelled like sewage. The ceiling was starting to cave in-in the rooms. The water in the bathroom would either stay cold or get extremely hot. The hinge to pull for shower faucet was broken in the room so couldn't use shower. The tub drain is clogged. The hair dryer in the room sparked and popped in my face twice and then stopped working. Half the elevators weren't working. My tower had ONE working elevator, so the time to get up and down took very long! They charge a full day to have late/extended check out.   OH BY THE WAY: I had a "Suite" room!  THIRD: The biggest thing was customer service! Everything else would've been manageable if the hotel customer service were understanding or just NICE about all the issues. We tried to change rooms due to the problems, but they wouldn't work with us, were very rude, and hung up when we asked for a supervisor. I also witnessed an employee yelling at someone in the casino for crossing in front of her even after they said sorry.   FINALLY: Soooo all-in-all, you get what you pay for! Cheers! :)

Froyo, froyo... Where art thou froyo?   At Top That!   The cake batter is a favorite of mine! My usual is cake batter, with cheesecake bites, strawberries, some hot fudge, sprinkles, and almonds. Everything is either fat free, low or no sugar, and still delicious. Sometimes they have red velvet cake that is so delish! They let you try any ice cream, just ask for a sample cup. They have a vast array of toppings from mochi and bursting boba, gummy bears, crushed oreo, cheesecake bites, brownie bites, confetti cake bites, fruit and nuts, to sprinkles and hot fudge.  The customer service is always great. They always ask me first if I want a receipt or not. Very clean place, no restroom that I can tell. For a warm day, they have a shaded patio with misters. A must try!  Oh and PS: Make sure you give them your phone number whether they ask or not! If you do, they'll give you a free ice cream after so many ice creams you buy! It's their rewards program :)

I usually give five star reviews but I just can't here. First... I came because I read they have fresh daily macaroons. They don't unless it's during the warm months. Disappointing, but okay. Second... Ordered an almond milk tea, no Boba or anything. It's pretty good, but I've definitely had much better elsewhere. Third... the service is very slow!!! It's Friday night, I had to wait more than five minutes just for a milk tea on ice, not blended, and there were four people that had waited longer than I to get theirs from what I saw. Also, the girl at the register did not have a great attitude, and I feel like that service did it for the three stars. Great location though for North Valley!

Decided to give this place another shot, the first time wasn't a great experience due to the girl not giving great service but the Milk Tea is pretty good and I can't help but crave it!   The girl working today was a different girl, blonde hair, and she was really friendly... Thank you! Ordered another Almond Milk Tea and didn't have to wait long at all like last time.   Hip music, very  clean place, nice environment, plenty of business, and they leave the doors open for you on a beautiful day. I recommend trying this place out! :)

I have been here a couple times and they always have amazing service! Danielle helped us this time and she was very patient with us as we took foreverrrrrr to choose and we're back and forth indecisive :P  Pistachio is amazing and the Milk Chocolate Marshmallow Fluff is my favorite so far but that's a season item. Can't wait for it to come around next year, they said around Easter!   They give you a free slushie if you write a review on yelp, so make it a good one! Definitely a must try place and who doesn't like macarons!!   Make sure to ask about their rewards program for points to get free cookies! Yay!

I was skeptical.... Fractured Prune?? But I needed a coffee fix and there isn't much around for that so I decided to check this place out. Usually doughnut/donut places have coffee! (Right?! )   Located at the Westgate shops, not at the Outlet mall but the one closest to the hockey stadium. I walk in.... Smells delicious!! Right off the bat, it smells amazing and I was welcomed by a very cheerful girl behind the bar. She asked if I've ever been there before and come out from behind the counter to help me!  I decided I no longer just wanted a coffee.... They have so many delicious choices and you can even make your own! Once you choose, you write the quantity of each doughnut you want on a piece of paper they supply and you pay. After you pay, they make the doughnuts right then and there, and since it wasn't crowded, my order came out super fast! They were so warm and moist. I had the Blueberry, Carnival, Coffee Cake, and Dulce de Leche and they were all amazing. They also offer hot or iced coffee and you can pour your own creamer, they offer flavors... And you put your own sugar, etc in it.   This place is a definite must try and I will definitely be back!

Very charming, local coffeehouse. Service is always very friendly. They make good specialty coffee, Americanos, and have free Wi-Fi. I got a Vanilla Cappuccino once and it was just okay, but I would still come back - maybe will try something else next time. I haven't seen this place really busy, but I see it's a great place for studying or just to hang out and read a book. Very quiet.

I used to always go way over to Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall for these babies as there's a Macaron Cafe there, but now I don't have to go so far! Which is awesome! I love almost every single flavor, except for Matcha Green Tea.. Not my fave.   The Pistachio is my top, I always get the most of these and then will try a new one or two as well. The Marshmallow one, isn't always in season, but when it's there it's a must try!! Also creme brulee, vanilla, jasmine, wedding almond, white chocolate, dark chocolate, and orange blossom (tastes like fruit loops).   I give five stars for this place because I'm so in love with the desserts and convenient location, and the price is better than Scottsdale, but the service could be a little more personable... They always make me feel a bit awkward and uncomfortable when trying to be friendly with them.  PS: Ask for a sample of the Mocha slushie! It's yumm.

Only good thing I have to say is that some of the workers here are nice. That's it. That. Is. It. I just spent about $25+ on a crappy carwash. I caught them blasting my stereo. Not just playing music. Blasting it. I listen to EDM through my Bluetooth in my car, but I never have it blaring. They had it on an FM hip hop station, I could hear it coming out of the wash tunnel. My car is brand new. NOT COOL AT ALL. I will now put my car in valet mode, everywhere I go, so thanks for that.   After getting my car back, there are spots all over the car, dirty grease spots from their towels, and the car still has a layer of black in areas all around it. They seem to rush through the towel process, and the vacuum process. The removeable carpet was vacuumed, but there's still dirt underneath it. I paid for the service where they shine your tires and wipe down inside. My inside doors weren't fully cleaned and there's still dust all over the middle console. There's a small shiny spot where they wiped. My rims are still black... The tires are shiny. Look, I get they don't get paid "executive salaries", but if I pay $25+ on a single dang carwash, it needs to be done right.   All in all, I will not return here again and will not recommend it to anyone I know. They get a one star for the radio incident. That's people's personal property - how dare you.   Anyone know of a good carwash place for higher end cars in the area?? :)
