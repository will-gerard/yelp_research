I've had my car washed at Los Olivos for a few years now and I'm not sure why I've waited to write a great review about them.  They are one of the few HAND car washes in the valley.  I have other car washes much closer to where I live but I will drive out of my way to have my car washed here because I will pass on the flinging rocks stuck in car wash tracks and a sub-par wash from other locations. Listen, my car is not new but I plan on keeping it awhile so I need it to always look like new and avoid dings in my paint or windows.  Bottom line is, you will receive quick wonderful customer service, a detailed wash at a great price...plus they have a punch card which I really appreciate.  Who doesn't want something free at a place you frequent? I also get my mats washed and had to get my head light covers cleared and they did it very well, quickly and again at a great price.    You should visit!

Sure, it's already known this a great pizza joint offering thin crust culinary delights but what I want to share in this review is their wings.  Whoa!  Definitely worth ordering on every visit.  Crunchy, tangy and slightly sweet - winning combination.   I may begin just going for the wings.  :)

On an incredible furniture hunt these last few weeks for a couch we searched high and low, east valley to west valley, central Phoenix to north Scottsdale and even online then finally we found a wonderful collection of comfy great made furniture.  We had specifics and yes our taste comes into play which is why I was hesitant about going to Copenhagen. I really had in mind that Copenhagen was going to be overly priced and way too modern for my taste.  I was wrong.  It definitely is modern but they offer pieces that have a great balance with modern and semi traditional.  Their leather choices are fantastic from color to grade.  On top of that, the service was phenomenal.  The sales people were not pushy at all and when we were ready to work with someone she was extremely knowledgeable and patient with all our questions and concerns.  I would most certainly recommend this place for their selection, service and quality.  One warning:  some pieces can take up to 4 months to get!  UGH!  So if you're thinking of buying something in the near future, start to look sooner than later.

I'm probably not a dentist or dental hygienists' dream.  I tend to not keep up with regular appointments and I'm ridiculously nervous in any area of the dentist office.  This has been my M.O. my whole life.  But my few experiences at Artistic Dental may have changed that for me.  Here's a few areas worth noting.  The office.  Artist Dental has a beautiful office located in the Camelback Corridor area.  They provide a very relaxed, homey feel to their waiting area, where you have a choice of chilled bottled waters, keurig coffees and teas and various snacks.  I don't imagine anyone who was about to see the dentist take up any of these offers but it's nice to the have the option while waiting for someone else or as you're headed out of the office.  Additionally, they provide views from each dentist chair (not sure what they are called) so you can see the sky and the beautiful church across the street.  They also have water features and lots of greenery to help soothe the nerves.  :)   Staff.  The staff is really remarkable.  They provide wonderful customer service and professionalism.  They certainly make you feel like they care about you and make you feel comfortable and let's face it, no one feels comfortable at the dentist office.  Mary M. (dental hygienist), is one of the most kind, gentle and pleasant people I've been around.   She does an excellent job and shows remarkable patience for squirmy patients like me.    I've recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Adhikari.  She has greatly helped with my fear of being in the dentist chair.  She's caring, patient and extremely funny which only makes the process that much easier.   I recently had to have a partial on my back molar and she made the process feel like a cake walk.  She explained all the steps, took a conservative approach and and established a relationship with me which made me feel at ease.   Because of Dr. Adhikari, I'm now brave enough to move forward with a dental issue I've been putting on the back burner for years.    Britni (Dental Assistant), was also a great pleasure to work with.  She is extremely professional but in a kind and gentle way.   Additional, the office allows for fraidy cats like me to listen to music while having any work done, rather it's a cleaning or something like a crown and cozy up in their plush blankets to help relax the nerves.  :)  The office of Artist Dental is a top notch office and I would highly recommend it as your dentist office too.

Yum, Yum Hillstone!!!  Things I love:  the smooth-as-butter, perfectly seasoned filet mignon, crisp, flavorful generous pours of white wine, the fresh, plump crab cakes and the packed with flavor, nutty and sweet cous cous.  My mouth waters thinking of it.  It's been our usual Friday night spot because the bar is beautiful and the patio is wonderfully designed to sit outdoors in the cool spring Arizona air and enjoy all that Hillstone has to offer on their menu.  Let's be clear about one thing however, not one thing on that menu can be on the low caloric side or even semi healthy..in fact, we learned that Hillstone is just Houstons (menu of course gave that away), but under a different name so the company doesn't have to release nutritional values...eeek!)  But I say so-what to that and enjoy this classy joint that offers high levels of fat and goodness.  I promise you won't regret it...

Groovy little flower shop.  If you're looking for something unique, eye-pleasing and hip this is your spot.  Camelback Flower Shop creates shabby chic and urban style flower and cactus arrangements.  I've stopped in several times for small succulents as holiday and hostess gifts and they have the perfect size, look and price for what I was looking for.  They also helped with creating a fun succulant center piece.  Fridays they do happy hour on their floral arrangements after 5pm - select arrangements are 50% off.  Stop by and see this gem!

I need a 3 1/2 star choice.  Four starts for the coffee, three stars for the atmosphere.    Things I like:  Their coffee: That's important when going to a coffee house.  Accessibility: Lots of parking available.  Local Support:  They had multiply local artist work there to buy including their baked goods.  Things I would work on:  Ambiance: A real bummer of a place.  I just wanted to get my coffee and get the heck out.  It was an environment I wanted to sit and enjoy.  When you think coffee house, you think a place to meet friends, read, relax.  Not here.  It was too quiet, sterile, and the staff need a kick of caffeine themselves and maybe some knowledge on their goods their selling.    So I write this review to let folks know to stop by and definitely grab a cup a joe to go and I also write this to let Mama Java's staff know they should take a lesson from Hava Java up the street when it comes to customer service.  You will never find the coffee spot empty.

I stumbled on this studio through Living Social and I'm so glad I did.  It's a small studio with only one room but it's really the perfect size for me. Although I typically look to yoga for the mental practice as much as the physical, this is more PHYSICAL than I realized I could do.  The classes in the A.M. have the same poses and flows daily but it does NOT make it easier.  It increases my heart rate and has me pouring in sweat and sore the next day but it's not too much that it should scare off any other newbies like myself.  I'm absolutely addicted and really dig the instructors.  I will say I liked the studio the first week I went prior to the new decorating. Although the mural in the studio is lovely it just had a very modern and clean feeling before. I also liked it without the curtains.  Either way, it makes zero difference, the classes are great!

Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.  1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers.  2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising. 3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought.   I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now.

I love this outdoor mall.  It's clean, it's open and has a wonderful restaurant selection.  It doesn't have a huge amount of stores but the stores it does have fits the bill. Now that it has J Crew life got a little sweeter.  I really miss the Border book store, however.   Some cool Biltmore activities are yoga in the park and movies in the park.  The movies are usually classics and happen during the fall.  Another bonus, is it's super dog friendly.  If you have a four legged friend to walk around with, make sure you walk to the east end of the mall and visit Arizona Humane Society's Petique to visit the other pups.  Happy Shopping!

Unity offers everything a church should offer.  They provide uplifting inspirational Sunday messages that always seem to hit home for me.  Reverend Maraj teaches these lessons with passion, humor and eloquence and always in a manor that easy to remember and to reflect on.    Unity also offers courses to work on spiritual practices from meditation and yoga to relationship and financial matters.  Every month a new list of courses are out or book clubs or community related events like hiking, golfing or picnics.  Unity offers everything you need to find balance and spirituality in all areas of your life.    Some super cool unity "features" are their labyrinth for mediation, their serenity courtyard and the very well stocked bookstore that offers all areas of religious studies and beautiful gifts.    Unity of Phoenix is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  It's a feel good place.

Camelback Spa is the tops for me!  Arizona is a mecca for spas and I've done my fair share of exploration. Time and again I return to this spa. The setting is remarkable. Nestled into the desert valley hills it creates an oasis that is true to its surroundings. The entrance alone promotes serenity, stillness, comfort and does so without being hokie. Decked out in southwest modern decor and tons of natural light this place offers a peaceful haven. Services are always top notch and consistently great. I've visited this spa a few dozen times and have never asked for the same masseuse and each time the service has been perfect. Their amenities are wonderful.  The lap size pool has the best views of any of the valley spas and offers tons of seating & cafe service. Sprouts is their spa cafe that has additional seating inside the spa as well. Sprouts offers delicious, fresh, filling dishes. Additionally there is a private sunning area for women only and a large, clean gym that offers a variety of equipment & free weights with tons of space. This spa has everything & meets all my needs. My suggestion is go early & spend the entire day there. Enjoy!

One of my favorite places in the valley. The Franciscan Renewal Center is just  lovely. Some of my favorite things are:   - Our Lady of the Angels Church.  It's beautiful small intimate setting and is unlike any other Catholic Church I've been to. It's circular building, stunning artwork and beautiful decor makes you feel comfortable and at ease.   - The grounds. Their property is expansive and just gorgeous. I love the desert background mixed with green grass & large trees. There are just so many areas to discover as you walk around. There's a huge Virgin Mary that makes you stop in your tracks. This area allows for meditation & prayer. The meditative walk Of the Stations of the Cross & the labyrinth create more space for quite contemplation, meditation & prayer.   - The Chapel. A reprieve from the summer heat if you've made your way there by foot & explored the rest of the grounds. This space is stunning. Praying the rosary there led by a prayer group or on your own is a must. A space for serenity, peace and an overwhelming sense if spirit makes this a must stop while visiting.    - Blessing of the Animals.  A great event to adopt a pet, but most importantly an event to take your fury, feathered, scaled friends to receive individual blessings.   I'm still discovering more about TFRC and I'm sure my experiences will be lovely.  I'll be sure to update as I learn more.

I was referred to this place by a respectable dog trainer who is passionate about dog's health and happiness and i can certainly see why.  This is place is no frills and all business, but in a good way.  As soon as I walked in the owner Arthur was there to find out what questions I had, what needs needed to be met and how he could help me make an informed decision.  I was grateful.  I was in the market to choose a good natural all stages dog food and he was there will detailed information.  He was fully aware of the ingredients and the type of food my breed of dog needed.  In addition, he took the time to write down all the ingredients I should avoid in all foods and treats.  He also took the time to write down a plan to wean my dog off their old food and into the new one.  He also discussed the best way to store the food to avoid bacteria growth which would cause intestinal problems for my puppy.  He also went into details with me about Arizona water and it's effects on dogs kidneys and ways to help with it if I must give her tap water but highly suggested filtered or distilled water.  He also discussed chew toys and why it's important to give her hard toys to assist in behavioral issues and ways to keep her teeth cleaned and so much more.  This was all extremely helpful since she's my first puppy and needed to do things right for her from the start.  Bottom line, they have excellent customer service, a wide selection of food to choose from and great prices.  I'm very happy with my experience and will certainly be a loyal patron.

Comfy, groovy, easy-going coffee house that invites all the neighbors over for great tasting coffee & some mellow live music. I wish I lived closer because this is the type of coffee house I could spend lazy hours people watching, unwinding & sipping some of God's nector. Love the mix of contemporary art & old fashion lounge chairs. The location is as important to me as the taste and the taste is on point. Creamy, sweet, mild iced Americano was a perfect compliment. Food is also served here but I can't speak to that...yet! I'll certainly be back.

Back in the day I would have described this place a little differently.  It seems to have lots its cool factor.  The casino feels old and a bit outdated.  It's not very crowded (good for those who are looking to avoid that completely) and it seems that some of the bartenders don't know how to make a martini straight up.  Our room was UNAPPEALING.  It was drab, outdated and boring.  Our friend had one of the larger corner suites and it was extremely roomy and offered beautiful views.  It was a much nicer room but the furniture was dirty and stained as well as the carpet.  Made a nice room feel icky. Our other friend had a room I didn't know they HAD!  He was checking in for a trade show and just wanted an average (or better of course) room but somehow ended up with a stripper pole, leopard print comforter, disco ball and floor to ceiling mirrors.  Um, this would be appropriate for a bachelor party or some event upon request but just checking in for a few nights to do some work seems a bit unacceptable.  Of course he asked for another room and was changed immediately.  Overall, not impressed with this hotel as I was in the past.

Ah-mazing! I love this Phoenix gem! It's my go to for celebrations, a place to take visiting guest, date night, night with the girls, all occasions! Prepare to indulge and do not count count calories.  You're eating quality ingredients with remarkable flavors.  The Barrata is superb! Smooth creamy Barrata with aged sweet balsamic vinegar and thin cuts of prosciutto on toasted bread is a must! Pizzas, oh the pizzas...are made in a wood fired oven and offer the perfect toasted yet chewy crusts. I highly recommend the Diavola if you like spice.  You can always add a touch of coolness by adding ricotta cheese. Secondly I recommend their Salsiccia con Potate. Baked chunks of seasoned potatoes with sausage and mozzarella.   All desserts are wonderful, great coffees and homemade creamy lemoncello.    Notes: Sunday brunch is offered with a slightly different menu. They also serve chorizo that is remarkable! They serve a pizza much like the Salsiccia con potate with pesto & onions.  Sounds strange but it's delicious!   Homemade pastas served only 2 nights a week. Check their website. Currently it's Wed & Thurs.   Only beer & wine; except at brunch where they offer Bloody Mary's.   Bon Appetit!

Oh, strange sounds are forming as I'm thinking about my wonderful experience at Sensi.  My meal was amazingly decadent and delicious.  I'm already planning my next trip to Vegas just to stop in this restaurant for another meal and cocktail.  We had the TLC roll - Tempura lobster and crab with whipped avocado and siracha aioli.  Beautiful and delicious.  We also shared the steamed buns - so flavorful we thought of ordering a second round.  Finally we had pork potstickers, mmm mmmm.  Such an amazing meal.  I also had a cocktail - something Crush..vodka, crushed raspberries, mint and club soda, so refreshing.  It was an outstanding meal and I'll certainly make it my place to dine while in Vegas.  To top it off the restaurant was super sexy and sleek.  Loved that you could view the three kitchens all the way around from these gorgeous floor to ceiling windows.  Lovely lovely.

AJ's is the place to go when you are looking for good deli meats, bakery items or unique appetizers or supper fixings. Love going here for the fresh pasta bar or salad bar. Pizza by the slice isn't bad either.   AJ's is a little more than the regular grocery store, but you do get what you pay for here. Quality is definitely higher here at AJ's. Wish I could do all my grocery shopping here, but I do have to live within a budget.

I'm a fan!  Acacia Cafe has won my Sunday morning breakfast-eating heart.  I love the the fresh fluffy omelets...light and tasty with fresh crisp veggies and light, nutty, buttered-to-perfection toast that is lined with sunflower and pumpkin seeds...mmmm mmmm.   I'm not sure if the packaged jelly's on the table are their own but they sure taste like it, not too sweet like most commercial types. I've also had their sandwiches & salads and you cannot go wrong with those either.  This place is a must visit if you want a yummy, fresh meal at a decent price.  The service can be a bit flaky, but I'm willing to overlook as long as the food keeps coming out hot, fresh and yummy.  Beware, if you sit inside you may smell like breakfast all day...might  be okay if you like that sort of thing.  :)

A few things I heart about this theater is:  1) Ability to purchase tickets online, which allows you to reserve seats & avoid lines so you can show up last minute. 2) Comfy seats and some recline...yummy!  3) Having a server  Areas needing improvement:  1) The food! Oh gosh, if you're going to sell this place as a dine in theater amp it up AMC! In this case simple is better. Go with the classic movie foods: hotdogs, pretzels, roasted almond. Just amp up the quality to differentiate yourselves from the other movie theaters. Make them gourmet classics. Even Ipic got that right!   All in all it's a fun way to watch a movie, convenient & comfortable but the food makes me miss the classic movie theaters.

I've been to Pita Jungle a handful of times, but this time I have found THE DISH!  I had the mahi mahi with pico on top of jalapeno cilantro hummus and seasoned pita chips. Mmmmm Mmmm!!!  It was delicious, filling, and a really beautiful dish.  On top of that, it was not bad in calories. Yes, I know, calorie talk...YUK, but really not terrible for the amount of food you get and the taste!  A must try!

Wow, can you get lost in this place. I have driven by this place so many times and always wanted to stop. Wish I would have stopped months ago! This place has so many cool pieces of furniture. Most of which is made on the premise.   Urban Southwest has numerous rooms that are set up with tables, seating and accessories. Great way to get ideas. Nick was extremely helpful in how they build their product and how they can custom build anything for you. The furniture is a little more than most places, but that is understandable with most everything custom made.   Will be stopping by here again the next time I am in need of a table. Thanks Nick!

Beautiful Loop!!!! Been down this street many times before I even knew it had it's own Yelp listing. Gorgeous tree lined street with dream homes to your left and right.   This is definitely one of my favorite places in Phoenix. If you have the money this is one of the best locations in the city and has that older neighborhood feel.   Go early in the morning and you enjoy the early morning sun shining on Piestewa Peak and Camelback.

An amazing holiday event that is a must visit each year.  It's also a wonderful event to take out of towners or to give as a gift.    The Luminarias is an adult holiday extravaganza!  This event includes 11 bands from swing to carolers.  My favorites were the Travelers who not only played incredible music but put on a good show, Chris Burton Jacome, Spanish Guitarist, who put on such an incredible beautiful and relaxing show and the Carolers who made you feel that Christmas had arrived.  This whole thing is set up in such a beautiful location with hand lit luminarias.   The garden had stunning sculptures pepped throughout by Carolina Escobar (changing exhibition) and Chihuly in the entry to the garden.  To boot there are plenty of bars serving wine, hot toddies and hot chocolate for the kiddies.  In addition, you can purchase meal tickets to their buffet which never lets down on a good meal where you can meet and chat with great people.  All in all, it's a MUST visit with family and friends.  It always provides a wonderful evening.

Um...WOW.  This is a tremendous cup of coffee.  I am a huge fan of how this coffee is prepared.  First, they roast their own beans (or so I read, I'll have to double check this) but most importantly they grind the beans upon order, then use the European style of brewing.  They pour almost boiling water slowly and methodically over the grounds and let it drip through a drip pot.  Each cup is brewed this way.  It takes a little longer but totally worth the wait. So much more flavorful and rich.  I have yet to find another coffee spot that does it this way.  My only dislike was the location I visited was a bit dark and could use a little more welcoming atmosphere but the coffee is really what it's about and I just wish there was one closer to where I live, I would be a daily customer.

Clean and relaxing spot to get your mani/pedi done right and right away.  They always offer great customer service and give you small discounts if you pay cash.  They will also offer deals if you go Mon-Thurs as well.  In addition, parking is super easy.   It's one of the nicer nail salons in the valley for a good price.

This little hole-in-the-wall (said with respect) is a must visit!  I don't think I would have visited this place had it not been for Yelp.  The previous reviews made it enticing to visit and the Yelp "groupon" made it even more. The carne asada is fabulous, the whole pinto beans packed with flavor the salsas delicious.  We'll certainly revisit.  Plus the service was top notch.  May be family owned which I love!

An Arizona Humane Society satellite location located in a dog friendly out door mall, and a beautiful one at that.  This is a wonderful addition to the Biltmore.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, they have all types of pet goodies and feature local businesses and artist of pet products which is just another plus about this store!  The best thing is they have kitties, pups, bunnies up for adoption so it's great way to raise awareness, funds and forever homes for these furry friends.  One more quick thought - prices are less expensive on some products I've seen at big box pet stores which is pretty amazing since it's not usually that way with smaller independent stores.  Plus, they have a members system that allows you to get a small discount on items so save money and help a great cause.

We drive a little out of the way to go this target because it's clean and is surrounded but many other stores we frequent.   It's usually pretty busy so plan to park a bit further than most.

Real text sent to friend - "You MUST eat at Holstein's buns and shakes next time you're in Vegas and order the Gold Standard med rare w/ onion rings! You must!!!"  One more addition to this review...Amanda, our server was entertaining and knowledgeable.  She made the meal that much better.  You should definitely ask to be seated in Amanda's section.

I had high hopes for this ultra cute bungalow coffee house and bakery.  Walking in I loved the eclectic style of art and feel to the place.  Even the dishes are a mix of grandma's high tea to casual plastic cups.  The breakfast and lunch menu are a small which I actually think is a plus in a small place like this. I figured with a small menu you would master these few dishes making your coffee shop even more appealing.  But to my dismay this is where the coffee shop lost it's charm.  The quiche was odd.  Weird to say that but it was and I LOVE QUICHE!  But the consistency was undesirable.  It was like flan and turned into mush in my mouth.  It also only had a few veggies on the top layer but not throughout.  I think (and this is only speculation) but it may have had some cream of mushroom or something as the base.  It was just not very good.  I ate about an 1/8 and threw it out.  I felt terrible about wasting the food and money.  My boyfriend had the croissant sandwich with bacon and eggs.  Again, it was a let down.  It was super boring and it could have easily been made in my own kitchen.  As for the coffee, since this is a coffee house, was also not what I would have expected.  The iced coffee was super watery.  It had a decent taste but it lacked boldness.  We also tried the lattes the day before and they were nothing to get uber excited about.  Really let down because reading the reviews and seeing the place for myself it seemed like a charming urban coffee shop.  It definitely has potential if they could master the dishes and more importantly the coffee.

I found Bosa after an amazing meal at Becketts Table. I know, what the hell am I doing going across the street after a huge meal. Well, with experiences at great donut places in Texas, I have always wondered where the great donut place is for AZ.  Bosa Donuts is that place! They carry all the classic donuts and you won't be let down. These are not like the large chain donut places. Bosa donuts are always fresh, whether you are there at 6:00am or Midnight. Yes, I know.   Bosa Donuts is THE Donut Place in PHX!

I hate to  give 2 stars...however, I know i must be honest in my experience and 2 stars portrays it's perfectly.  I had high hopes for this place considering all the wonderful reviews, but I was not a satisfied customer this Sunday during their brunch. This is only a review on brunch.    Service:  Mixed reviews.  First off, we walked into a 1/3 of a full restaurant with plenty of seating and prepared tables but were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  WHAT???  Why not seat us and at least give waiting patrons drinks.  We figured it was short staffed and thought we would just grab a coffee at the bar that had 3 servers behind it and less than half the seats filled.  Apparently that was not going to happen smoothly.  The bartender didn't acknowledge us and when she did decide to help a customer it was one that came after us.  Already, a bad taste in my mouth.  Once she deiced to ask what we needed (a simple request for coffee), she asked her two colleagues to take care of it who then mumbled under their breath that they didn't wish to.  Possibly it was dissension between the three of them, but why make the customer aware of it.  In the end, we got seated before the three of them could decide who was in charge there.  Our server at the table was great and he made up for our first 2 awful experiences.  He was upbeat and knowledgeable.  Thank goodness.  Food:  Maybe I'm becoming a food snob, but North does not seem to have authentically made food.  It taste loaded with fat, salt and sugar.   I ordered something simple...Irish Oats with Apples with a side of scrabbled eggs and garlic toast.  The Irish Oats were very sweet but I will say I did love the whipped maple brown sugar mouse but realized they forgot to add the apples.. no big deal.  I just asked the waiter about it and very sweetly offered to bring me a side of them.  He then brought me another bowl of the oats which he didn't have to do so I thought it was a kind gesture.  However, as in the first bowl it was missing another ingredient..the candied pecans.  Somehow one ingredient goes missing.  :)  No harm, no foul, but just odd.  In addition, neither bowl was hot.  The second issue were with my eggs.  How can you mess up scrambled eggs??  The were LOADED with salt.  I assume it has to be an error since most restaurants let you salt your own eggs.  These salty eggs were certainly inedible. On the plus side, their garlic toast was pretty tasty.    I don't think I'll be back to North.  If I do return it will be to try their dinner menu and of course if I have a better experience I'll update this review.  Their breakfast and their service I will choose to pass on.

Taste a little like out of a box.  Sorry, just felt unimpressed and peeved that I bought this.  I'll continue on with my cupcake quest.

Completely let down! Looked forward to this event and invited friends and bummed we did. Too long of lines, parking was a mess, and some booths had you wait in line buy tickets then wait in another line to get your food, which was over priced and small portions. So terrible. Hate all the lines and HATE that we had to pay to come into this mess and pay to park. A complete joke! Take a tip: either twice as many trucks or limit your tickets. More alcohol stations and better music. Scale down prices if you're going to charge us to get in.

Wonderful service, quaint atmosphere and top of the line products.  I see Jojo Caramello for waxing and facials and I'm ALWAYS extremely pleased with my service.  I highly recommend Olos and Arizona Brow Company.

Excited to have this local gem in the airport. No secret it has some ah-mazing food/beverages. Only issue is it's not so easy to see where the line forms to order and it bottle necks and results in several "are you next" questions to be asked to all the other patrons standing around you. Hope they can work on signage to streamline the issue. Glad to see LGO in the airport where it will gain stong visibility.

Can only recommend this place for a great ice cold beer but nothing more. Had the Nitro Nachos...eek, me thinks not! Poor quality ingredients. If they mess up nachos with simple ingredients what other harm can they do w/ the rest of their menu. Restaurant its self needs a little sanitizing & sweeping. I would feel bad about the glass my beer came in but they serve in red solo cups. First time I'm happy to see them.

Me likey!  The Dry Bar is a girl-on-the-go's dream!  Atmosphere is beautiful, modern and fun - music is blasting (not annoyingly loud), movies playing and a load of trashy gossip magazines.  It's super simple to choose you style and get it done.  I loved the smell of their products and I really dug the concept.  In addition, they offer package deals to help the busy gal save money if she plans on dropping by frequently.  I could certainly see myself going back and maybe often enough to buy one of their packages.  P.S.  They are great at merchandising - buy your hairdryer, brush, products, accessories or gourmet snacks.  LOVE!

Not a very long wait, very nice staff & doctor. Building was clean and welcoming. Overall a welcoming experience. Urgent Care is usually for those who cannot wait another minute to be seen & helped so a welcoming environment and a kind staff is very important. Hoping for location a bit closer to home. This was a bit further than I would like.

Love their sister restaurant, Citizen Public House & I love their chef, owners managers & servers. As a patron & a client (group events) these sister restaurants are unique, refined & unmatched. Try their Original Chopped Salad, roasted Brussels sprouts on creamy corn grits, pan seared scallops, burgers you name it.  I love their creativity & use of rich tasting ingredients.  Their drinks are one-of-kind.  Again their creativity & uniqueness shines through. The Gladly is certainly worth a visit. Their staff is extremely knowledgable & makes you feel right at home.  Cheers to a memorable experience!

Oh for heaven's sake try this homemade ice cream!! Trust me! They serve up interesting combo of flavors, like lavender honey, sweet corn or green chartreuse ice cream. Plus nothing says gluten like smacking these bold flavors in their homemade sweet, crisp waffle cones or between two house made cookies! I love this place so much I'm buying a t-shirt!
