FYI Suzanne's Bridal Boutique in Gilbert is by far the absolute worst place I have ever stepped foot in! Yes the dresses are pretty but seriously their service is worse than horrible!!! They have terrible customer service. They are by far the rudest people I have ever met. The charge hundreds of dollars more for dresses that you can buy online for next to nothing. ANNNDDDDDD they have the worst alterations, they truly are pathetic! The faberic was coming apart and had to get them to fix it, but worst of all was the corset they put in this dress was off by a half an inch on one side. Their way of explaining it was "oh you just pull it tighter" REALLY?!? Seriously save yourself the time, money, and frustration GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE! Shopping for your wedding dress is supposed to be a happy time not a time where you are to be treated with 0 respect.

Went here after school with the kids and was very disappointed. The place was very dirty including the table. That is when we should have left but nope we stayed. That was a huge expensive mistake. The food tasted  gross to all of us. Never again!

Denny's oh Denny's where have you gone?!? You used to be so much better. I have always and I really do mean always loved Denny's. Growing up we would go every week. It was our thing.  Fast forward a little tad bit more than a few years later, and uuuggghhhhh what happened?!? Between the inedible and cold food, the high school softball team, and the waiter it was by far the very worst experience! Ya know when you take a family of five to dinner it gets pretty dliping expensive. You are celebrating hubby changing careers. It should be worth it. Ya no not even close. The girls up front we sweet poor things had to deal with the toolbag all night, we just had him screwing up our meals. Those girls are the only reason that you even got the two stars.

Sitting here with my kids and hubby having a wonderful dinner! My middle son is super picky and actually has a full plate almost polished off. Normally it seems like Asian buffets are not the biggest about having kids in the group but they are so awesome about it. The workers are great.  Can't wait for our next trip here!

Delicious as always but gotta say the service is wow! All of us who live out this far know that customer service is a 4letter word to most the food places around here, but not this place! This is now the third time that I just happen to look at something debating if I want it and BAM the owner is right there with awesome suggestions. She even noticed kids wanted some sweet donuts and with ten minutes to closed made some fresh ones!! This place is wonderful!!

There are not words to explain how wonderful Dr. Young Lee and his staff are. I have a special needs daughter who was in a lot of pain from a bad tooth. Let me say WOW! He and his assistant were marvelous! My daughter had absolutely no clue that she was going to get a shot in her mouth and still has no clue it happened all because of the amazing act between the two of them! "Ooooo Dr. Lee forgot to cut his nails again ooopps I am so sorry" WOW Thank you so much Dr. Lee you are truly the most caring and compassionate person I have ever met! Thank you!

Wow pretty impressed with this place! I destroyed my phone so had no way to call. I reached out on Facebook thinking ya like they will actually respond. No one responds to Facebook questions it seems. But he actually responded and FAST! I was shocked. Even though the part I need is not available, I will definitely be keeping his contact info on me in case I ever do need help again!
