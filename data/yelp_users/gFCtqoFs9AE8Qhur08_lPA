We went to Glendale for my son's game, not a lot of choices to eat near the school but I looked on yelp and found Vito's...had a good rating and the reviews were very good!  We drove in and were a little surprised to see a kind of "hole in the wall" type place in a strip mall but hey, I trust yelpers! We walked in and ordered 2 pizza's....the service was quick and the pizza was too die for! We left saying that we hoped our son played the same team next year so we would have a reason to return to this part of Glendale! Really really good pizza!!!!!
