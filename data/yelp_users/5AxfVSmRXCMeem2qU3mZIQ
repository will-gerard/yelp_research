This establishment is not only my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. It is my favorite restaurant of all time and if my boyfriend would let us eat there every time we go out...I would. Beyond the delicious (d e l i c I o u s) food, the service is fantastic. If Joe is bartering I highly recommend you enjoy your dinner from the bar - he's the best!!!

The only thing this place has going is its decor. I didn't choose this place based on the menu - was just meeting friends. So, I chose the only thing that sounded good...the "bacon and egg crepe." Strangely it had what seemed like THREE WHOLE ONIONS in it and there was one egg on top of the crepe opposed to inside it? It was basically inedible. Honestly one of the worst menus I've seen and worst meals I've had at a Phoenix restaurant.  I also had a bite of my boyfriend's sandwich (some kind of rib eye breakfast sandwich) and it was tasteless. The service was also horrendous: our server was rude and the food and drinks took a ridiculous amount time.  I wouldn't go back to this place to eat if someone paid me.

Curried noodles with the shrimp is officially one of my new favorite meals. So fresh and still so flavorful. Honestly amazing...SO impressed.

You couldn't pay me $30.00 to eat here again...which is how much it costs for the following: bland not special fries (also cold); I could make a better milkshake at home in my vitamix (which we're assuming I own for the purposes of this review); burger might be good without that disgusting wonderbread bun; chicken sandwich decent. #dissapointed
