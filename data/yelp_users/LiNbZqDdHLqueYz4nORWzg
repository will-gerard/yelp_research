I came here for an oil change after not being able to make it in time for another Jiffy Lube location nearby and felt as though I was of inconvenience to the employee that "greeted" me there.  I got here about 30 min to closing, and as I am pulling up the "greeter" raises up his arms as in frustration and immediately tells me its a "45 minute wait," which I was ok with.  He tells me quickly after, it'll be more like an "hour wait" which was still OK with me.  I did not feel quite welcome, although he did give me the usual welcome routine, "there's the coffee, the bathroom, if you need anything... Etc." which did not feel genuine.  I would certainly not come back to this location for the unwelcoming environment.

the customer service here is horrible and that is because of the one guy that sits behind the counter, gave me attitude about getting MY car looked at for an alignmnent I wad already willing to PAY for.  people with bad days shud jus stay home...

I come here mostly for coffee on the way to work - consistent taste and I enjoy their iced mocha coffees- very sweet and strong!! inside seating is nice, but ive only done drive-thru- clean outside, reasonable customer service :)

very good service, relaxed atmosphere, came here mid morning and there was no waitin too much for my order- coffee and a muffin.  a lot of people come alone, so seating can be limited- there is outside tables where u can sit as well.  ive been here for my first time few years, glad to see it still operating and no drastic changes noted :)

Always here for their California burritos... The burritos are huge and can be easily shared by two people.  Their jalapeno and carrots are somethin I havent seen at other similar places, id recommend it if you,re lookin for some heat! The drive thru service is fast and friendly.  I have seen they did remodel the inside seating and does not look as,roughed up as before... There is a drawback when using your card to pay- 50Â¢ addtl charge, which shud b done away with.

I went here to have breakfast with a friend for the first time.  The service was very good and the waitress checked on us more than one time.  It is in a off location, doesnt stand out- look out for a house at the corner of the street.  It has indoor and outdoor sitting- which would be nice for the fall but not in the summer.  The decor inside was fitting  and menu was very simple.  We sat a rickety table, so that might need a look at, otherwise I would like to go here again for lunch or even dinner.

I came here on a school night.  There were no crowds, but we did see what looked like a crowd of teenaged football players.  The atmosphere was o-kay.  The thing I did not like most about this place was what they considered their buffet.  Everything tasted old and as if it was they were trying to get rid of the last inventory of food they had in their "kitchen" before the weekend crowd was going to roll in the next day.  Ill give it a half-star for the kids at least having fun there.  I will think about going back again.

Am I the only one with enough times where I get my order right! I always have a good drive thru experience, it really is helpful to have your payment ready.

This is a smaller subway, good seating, not a very big lunch crowd when i went; parking is cramped cause of other stores in same strip.  Just ur average Subway :)

I came here looking for the usual- California Burrito and some Jamaica.  I did not get either.  I went through drive-thru and the person taking my order didnt understand my English, so I had to come to the window to ask about their menu.  I could barely understand her English, so I just opted for some quesadilla.  It was okay and I cant compare it to the usual Mexican food I have at Vaqueros on 19th and Southern.  The food was just okay and I was disappointed mostly because I did not have someone who spoke clear English- customer service was okay otherwise.

If you have time to wait in drive thru line in the mornings, go for it.  I have not had a bad experiences with customer service or orders: a win-win.  This location is located in a little strip with wi-fi available, merchandise on shelves and floor and plenty of seating.  Inside note: Phoenix PD frequents place in mornings, go figure :-)

this is the best panda express in phoenix, great customer service and the food is never dry of overly greasy.  believe me ive tried other panda express places in phx and mesa! its a good bargain for your dollar- im impressed i can feed my family of 4 for less than 20 bucks (most times)... yum yum orange chicken.   its right off the free way and convenient if youre on the go.  ill keep coming back :)

Ive had bite me subs deliver to my office many times; they always had my order right and the food was always packaged well along with napkins, ketchup, etc.  I like ordering tuna or spicy chicken sandwiches;most sandwiches come with fries.  The bread is always fresh... Try their cheesecakes, yum yum!

This is a good McDonald's in the Tempe area.  They have good customer service and never have gotten my order wrong.  This is a place that usually busy with families (in Playland) and small crowds.  There is a highschool nearby, so i would be careful not to go during thier lunch hour if you dont want to run into crowds.  The only drawback I think is having to have a code to go into the bathroom :P.  I seen the code before on the reciept you would get at the register, but I dont see that anymore.

I have been here a few times for waxing and for manicures.  I like this place because it has a nice professional clean look and the employees are all (from what I have experienced) friendly.  I had a gel manicure done here and it came out very nice- I would keep coming back here as long as I am up to driving all the way to Tempe from Phoenix for the nail/wax service.

I took my son in for a haircut- he had so much that needed to be cut away and was need in a new do.  The barber was friendly and understood what style I was looking for and did a very great job with details in the cut.  I came here based on reviews and do agree, (for men) if you're looking for a good cut and in the downtown area, come to this place! :)
