Absolutely disgusting selection of meat. The produce isn't much fresher. And it never fails, whatever else I happen to need is out of stock. I loathe shopping here. I have complained to management before and it doesn't really do any good.

I have been gassing up here at least 1x a week the past few years. Very convenient location for me. I even use the drive thru car wash which usually did a great job. The last time I went thru the car wash, my car came out sopping wet. I keep a towel in my car and jumped out to wipe it down. Out of town I had to drive away and decided to come back the next day and ask for a refund. The clerk said she would have to ask the manager and came back to say they couldnt offer me a refund because I didnt announce there was a problem until the following day. No one even went outside to look at my car and survey the situation. This happened about 3 months ago and I have never returned since. If they dont want to refund me a measly $8 for a shitty carwash, I certainly wont be spending $60+/week to fill up my tank.

Have been here several times but won't be going back after our last visit. We went for a family birthday meal and everyone was sick the next day. No Bueno.

I recently moved near this area and was in search of a local shop. I've been here a couple of times and they have done a great job. I will continue to use them for my dry cleaning services.
