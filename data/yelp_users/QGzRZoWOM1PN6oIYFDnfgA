I have been going to this Cheba Hut since I was a freshman in high school. During that time, it was simply because I enjoyed the novelty of the place, and the food was good. Now I return simply for the amazing sandwiches.  The entire menu is great. Everything is fresh. Great sides like fruity pebble marshmallow treats. Great staff. Great music. All in all, amazing sandwiches in a relaxing, friendly atmosphere.

I went to Wokee Express tonight, per my friend's suggestion. If I'm craving Chinese food, I typically go to Taste Of China. However, I wanted to try something different, so I asked around, and was directed to Wokee Express.  The price of the food is great. At dinner, I got a large chicken plate combo. "Combo" means it comes with rice, egg roll, and crab puff. All of this only cost $7.75.  However, the chicken was over-cooked, and the batter the chicken was fried in was soggy and mushy. There were no carrots or peas in the fried rice, which is a huge deal to me for some reason.  So overall, if you're on a budget and want some good Chinese food, go to Taste Of China.

I took my cat in because he was obviously sick from something and they have a free exam for new clients. The veterinarian performed the exam and then explained to me that she thought it may be possible that he had swallowed a string, which was blocking his intestines. After attempting multiple times to convince me to pay for all the x-rays and possibly surgery, I ended up only purchasing the fluid shots because he hadn't been eating.     Before leaving, she tried to scare me into it one more time by saying that if he did not improve, that I should consider euthanasia. This offended me EXTREMELY considering that she had no idea what exactly was wrong, and that all she wanted was for me to hear that and decide to spend more money. I will never, no matter what, return to Val Vista Animal Hospital based solely on this experience.    Also, my cat is now perfectly healthy and needed no medical attention whatsoever.

I haven't been here in years until today. And with minimal shame, I actually went there twice. The Happy Hour is from 11am - 7pm. That is amazing. I like to refer to it as a 'Happy Day' special.  Both times I went, I got the chicken strips which are on the happy hour menu. Great both times. $2.50 draft pints. I only have one complaint.  I'm not sure if they change it at night, but the volume was muted on all of the televisions and the radio was playing instead. If I'm at a sports bar, I'd rather not listen to 99.9 FM, but instead hear SportsCenter.

I love Taste Of China. I eat here at least once a week. Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small. Also, they are incredibly fast. If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes. Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house. My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken.

Absolutely amazing. Dick's Hideaway is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It's very hard to find if you don't know where it is, however. It is a very small place, as there are only a total of 4 tables other than the private party room.  The blackened swordfish is DELICIOUS. Along with the fish, you get jumbo shrimp, vegetables, and the best part. The best part I refer to is the twice baked potato over a VERY spicy green chile. I like spicy food, and it was very hard to handle this pepper. And then after you finish your plate, you discover that it was all on top of a tortilla which has soaked in all sorts of flavor from your entree.  I strongly urge everyone to try this restaurant.

So I have re-evaluated my experiences at Zipps in Gilbert and I have decided that I should really update my review. I LOVE ZIPPS. Great happy hour. Great bar food. Great service. Great management and employees. One employee specifically, ERICA, always provides the best service imaginable. Go to Zipps, find Erica, and tell her that Tim sent you.

Absolutely terrific.  Delicious, relaxing, and euphoric.  With the popularity of Joe's Real BBQ, this restaurant has sky-rocketed to the top of the list of recommended eateries in Gilbert.  Everything on the menu is DELICIOUS.  I typically tend to order the Pulled Pork sandwich, which is what they are known for in my opinion.  Tonight, I ordered the Pesto Chicken Sandwich per the suggestion of the cashier.  I also got an order of the chili cheese fries.  Both were great.  I'd consider myself a chili afficionado, and this chili was awesome. Perfect blend of meat and sauce.  The atmosphere is very euphoric to me.  There is indoor seating with lots of stuff to look at while you stuff your face with scrumptious food.  There is also seating outside, which is what I'm specifically referring to.  I always eat outside here.  There are wooden picnic benches, amongst beautiful old trees, which takes me back to when I was a young child and my family and I would eat at the park together.  It relaxes me very much, actually.  Also, the breakfast menu they have in the morning is very good. I have only had it once, the breakfast tacos, and it was just spectacular.  5 stars. A must eat. Go here. Now.

I think this place is great. While the sushi isn't exactly traditional, everything is great. Every time I go there, I start with the Krusty Krab roll which is absolutely delicious. I would steer away from the garlic edamame unless you loooove garlic. I could taste garlic for days after eating it. But overall, the martinis are great and the prices are decent. I love the decor, as well. Very modern.

I believe they're called BevMo because everything here costs just a little "mo" than anywhere else. All of their craft beers and liquors are $1-4 more expensive than the grocery store or even QuikTrip.  Sure, there are options here that are not available at grocery stores or QuikTrip. However, all of these options (and many more) are available at Total Wine, a short 10 minute drive away from the doors of BevMo.  As far as I'm concerned, their only redeeming factor is that they are more prone to having my bourbon of choice in stock. However, I attribute this entirely to their location.  After visiting this place several times, I've decided that I will not be back; unless I'm all out of Buffalo Trace. Might as well go across the street to Sprouts and save a few bucks.

Simply amazing. Everything on the menu is excellent. The imitation ground beef is even good. While eating my girlfriend's vegetarian shepherd's pie, I didn't even realize it was imitation until it was already gone.  Great service, awesome atmosphere and decor. Very reasonably priced. Great happy hour.  Also, I just can't seem to get enough of the Strongbow Cider that they have on draft. If you haven't been to Cornish Pasty yet, you need to get off of Yelp and drive there immediately.

I LOVE Total Wine. It's like BevMo but better. It is closer to my house than any grocery store, so if I'm buying drink, I go here. The prices are phenomenal, the customer service is amazing, and the selection is ridiculously large. I would definitely consider myself to be a regular here. I don't know if that's a good thing exactly, but whatever.  If I could give Total Wine 10 stars, I would without second-guessing it.

Won't even price match THEIR OWN WEBSITE. Laaaaaaaame. Just stick with Amazon. No wonder B&N can't compete.

Finally somewhere in STV that I can revisit. Delicious food. Massive portions. Good value. Free delivery. Friendly staff.  There isn't much to complain about. In fact, I can't think of a thing.  I'll be back to Bobo. Yep, sure will.

I dig it. Been there twice now. I, by no means, am an expert on Thai food. But, I've been eating food for a few years and I like how this tastes.  I've enjoyed their green curry and the Penang curry. Reasonably priced. Reasonably spicy. Reasonably pleased.  Friendly, helpful staff. Quickly made and tasty. Additionally, look at your other options over here. How many times are you going to eat Chipotle before you lose your mind?

It's a shame that every place that pops up out here in the San Tan Valley area has a tendency to get bad reviews from unreasonably negative people.  BWW is awesome to have out here. Not only because it's something new, but this location in particular is consistently pleasant. Good service, good food, short waits (if there is one). Never had any problem here at all and each time my family and I visit reinforces its presence on our "go-to" list of STV/QC restaurants.
