Don't get me wrong - I enjoy a hole-in-the-wall sorta place. But I also expect the food to outshine the location, ya know?  First, let me say there was nothing -wrong- with the food.  The omelet was not under or overcooked - but it was just bland.  Personally, I like my omelets to have a little browning and caramelization and these were just typical and plain.  The coffee wasn't very good - it tasted a little burnt, in fact, and I left not very culinarily satisfied.  I can appreciate the unique look and feel (cramped as it is), and can tell there are a bunch of regulars whom the staff know by name, and there is a good "vibe" to the place.  But without the food to back it up, I doubt I'll be coming back.

Skip the airport lots and start with the rewards program at PreFlight! They pick you up and drop you off AT YOUR CAR! Both covered (canopy) and uncovered options, always fast and attentive, and service is great. (Its nice to tip your driver if they help with your bag and load your car.)  They've long had a rewards program that gives you your choice of airline miles, free parking days, car washes or detailing - and I appreciate having the options.  It's great to park for work and save up those points for personal trips.  Now, with their ExpressPass program, you can also receive a prox card you just wave at the gate to enter, and wave at the gate to exit - skip the exit lines, get an emailed receipt - love it for my expense reports!  They still have free water bottles at the exit - for a brief time you needed to ask at the gate for them, but they again have a working vending machine on the way out.  Just be polite and only take one per person.

I cannot speak highly enough of the entire team!  We've been taking our pets here for over 10 years and they have been wonderful, supportive, straightforward, honest, realistic, understanding, compassionate and passionate about whole-pet health.  Dr. Striyle is fantastic!  She very obviously loves animals, and showers yours with affection while somehow managing to be extremely professional at the same time.  The rest of the staff is also top notch (Claire, Kelley, Erica, Ashley, Stephanie and Analis are the ones we've worked with most) and work very hard to make your visits comfortable, professional and enjoyable.  It's obvious that the ethic and culture fostered by Dr. Striyle has permeated through the entire staff.  When we had to put down our beloved lab last year, the compassion and sensitivity shown by the Dr. and Claire was greatly appreciated - and we knew they grieved with us.  As we start with our new puppies, we know they will be in the best of hands here.

I do miss the days when Lenny would take the orders and be lambasted for doing everything wrong by the woman at the end of the line...  Ah, those were good days.  I'd never been to this location, and just so you know, there ARE more than the four bar seats next to the grill - just wait for your order, grab your shake, then head outside, turn right, and head into the much cooler (temp-wise, if not decor-wise) seating area.  You DID grab your shake, right? You mean, you didn't order a shake? Yeah, yeah - I know - you can't get a combo with a shake.  Splurge on the extra dollar and get the damn shake.  Cinnamon is one you can't get everywhere else.  Got it?  Good.  (Seriously. I'd be giving 3 stars without the shake.)  The burgers are good, flavorful, a little greasy, a little crisp on the edges sometimes, but always seem to hit the spot.  And I also recommend the onion rings.  I mean, you're not coming here because your trainer recommended it for your diet, you're coming for the burger, onion rings and don't-you-dare-forget - the shake.  Mmm.  Nummy.

I'd called around looking for help with my self-created pain in the glass - I only needed a replacement 11"x14" piece of glass (which is a standard size) and had been quoted anything from $10-$35!  Cindy gave me a better deal, and was happy to chat while I waited!  They've also started doing consignment - and they had some impressive furniture items - both in size and value.  Worth a check if you're in the market for some gently used items.

When Richardson's burned, I was crushed. The only thing that got me through the sorrow was the knowledge that Dick's had survived. The Hideaway was such a great local secret - waving to the hostess at Richardson's, walking through the kitchen and to the back entrance to an spot at Dick's always felt like I was a VIP in an exclusive group.  I no longer live in walking distance, but still make it back for their fantastic food.  Instead of reviewing the dishes (already well covered here), I'll just issue this statement - for those that can't handle spice, it may be difficult to find something truly bland here.  I love the melange, but some tender-tongues I've brought with me have been a little disappointed.  Okay, you got me - I couldn't leave without a couple food comments!  You cannot go wrong with the mixed grill special - no matter what it is.  Hell, any of the specials, really.  It's been so long since I ate from the regular menu that I just keep up to date by stealing smells and bites from my friends.  And I still love that GCP, but am one of the few that is NOT a fan of the Pasta Heidi (to me, it's just okay, you know?).  Oh, and if you could do me the favor of ignoring my five star review and never coming to this place, I'd appreciate it.  I like still coming here and having my seat available.  Thanks.

Sew Now is tucked behind Rosati's and Jack in the Box in the little strip mall - and it's a gem!  My better half has discovered the joys of custom clothing - which means buying stuff that fits right in all the right places, and then having Sew Now take care of the rest!  (I end up happy since she'll spend only $75 on jeans instead of $150+, and then get them altered to feel/look like she spent the larger amount.  Yay!)  Suri (sp?) is the wonderfully nice woman who takes care of us every time we're in, and does such great work for absolutely reasonable prices!  They work quickly, and the workmanship has been superb.  We've had everything from jeans (did I say how much we're saving with a $10 alteration? Yes - yes, I did.), shirts, slacks to jackets all saved or improved by Sew Now.  For example, they hem the jeans so that the original hem still shows - how do they do that???  Check 'em out - you may find that your wardrobe has new life!

So, when I heard that this place had it's own Pandora radio station, I just had to check them both out.  The station is alright, eclectic and I'll add it to my light rotation.  It was a good thing I checked it out online, since when we got to the restaurant, I couldn't actually hear it...  Nice, open atmosphere, bright and clean, and good breads upon which to load good stuff!  AZ Tri-Tip was good, nicely seasoned and tender, and the better half had the Market Tri-Tip and the rosemary came through nicely.    Some friends had raved about the cookies - and they -were- good, but I'm not sure deserving of the rabid nature of the recommendation.  The lemon with lemon icing was by far the better option - very lemony and my tongue danced with the brightness of it all.  And while I love me my carrot cake and tend to find the best in any attempt, I was less than enamored with the carrot cake cookie.  It tasted fine, but fell apart while eating, was a little too raisiny - so if you like messy, go for it.  We'll be back, and hopefully the music will be playing!

This place sure has changed a lot over the years - and for the most part, for the better.  They've updated their look since I was last here about 2 years ago with new furniture, paint job, decorations - looks more like a family Italian dinner place than the local, grimy-but-charming Italian lunch place I frequented.  The menu has been changed, and gone are the handful of lunch specials that could be had for $6-10 (this is what I miss), replaced by a single lunch special and a menu where most items are $10-15.  The food had always been good, and that has been maintained.  I still recommend their calzone - at $6.95 and $0.75 a topping, it's a reasonably priced lunch item that WILL fill you up (or provide an afternoon snack).  Italian sausage and basil pesto were delicious!  My friend was very pleased with the shrimp pasta (which he really should have made two meals of, but was wallowing in pleasant agony after finishing).  They still have a bar, and plenty of tv's, and think it likely still a good place to grab an after work libation and catch a game - but only if your part is small - it's not the largest place.  I'll be back for more calzone combinations!

First the good: I love the fact that as a business, BJ's supports groups like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is doing things in October for breast cancer awareness. I like that they have good seasonal brews - the pumpkin ale was quite tasty. They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around.  However. The quality of the service keeps us from making this place a regular stop. It's just so sporadic - sometimes it's all right and sometimes it's sub-par like today. We were greeted warmly, our server (Erica A) came quickly and when asked for an additional minute returned quickly to take our order. This is where it all fell apart. After taking our order, we saw her only once more before paying our check. I know our $25 order wasn't laden with lucrative alcohol - but no refills on water, showing disappointment when only one of us ordered more than water, having to flag a bus boy for silverware while our appetizer got cold, watching the manager watch the football game more than the service - it all just sours us from coming more frequently.   It's a place that I'd like to come for happy hour post-work - but I just never feel good about suggesting it with the experiences we've had.

Now if you're NOT a gyro lover, and you don't really like over-stuffed pitas, this really isn't your kinda place.  On the other hand, if you want honkin' gyros, loaded with that delicious melange of meat, sauce and fixin's, you NEED to give this place a shot!  Not only are these the biggest gryos I've had in the valley, but the pitas are perfectly soft and hot.  The tzatziki is awesome (though I order mine on the side so I can apply) and the french fries are always great too (but if you get them to go, they lose their crispy luster).  Hey, look - add a drink and you've got their gryo meal at a great price!    You can always substitute a greek side salad for the fries if you're going lighter.  Their falafel pita is also good, and my choice about a third of the time, and their veggie plate makes my tummy happy too!    I gotta give it to these guys, they give you great portions, good service, fair prices and even though I don't know their names, they recognize me from my repeat trips and welcome me with a "How ya doin?" every time!

Mmmmm.  Yummy.  First let me say that the unassuming facade says nothing about the little gem inside.  Since the place just opened, there's a banner instead of a sign, and a small curb tent directing diners in to the -only- open store in the building.  But for those who brave new frontiers, it's worth it.  Z's House Sandwich = Gooood.  The smoked pork brings out the sausage and bacon lover in me, and yet I was rewarded with an equally good helping of 'Fresh' as well - the cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers were all great!  The Egg Salad sandwich also received high marks from my compatriot, and I loved the option of the Orangina for drinks!  Which leads me to the second aspect of the place - while it has little for decoration (other than the very comely proprietor) it has a wonderful supply of European goods - chocolates, breads, biscuits, drinks, meats and yes, Eurocrem.  A vanilla and hazelnut spread that competes with Nutella in my book!  Ahhh, yes.    I hope others find and patronize this place enough to keep it in business, so I can continue to visit my happy euro-place!  Update: I'm happy to report that business seems to have picked up as there was a short line for lunch!  It didn't take long to get served, and they also offer lunch deals that are well worth the visit!

Dissociative Identity Disorder.  What used to be called Multiple Personality Disorder.  Ah-So suffers from it.  Badly.  Welcome Samurai warriors!  Here is your armor, katana and wakizashi! Cool. Oh, and across from it is a huge flat screen showing baseball...  ok... Thru the main doors and you meet the visual and audio cacophony of a liquor bar (replete with a display of all NFL helmets), sushi bar, cafeteria, dining booths and waaay at the back, the teppan tables.  Everything looks clean, shiny and new - I just don't think it all goes together very well.  The sushi:  the rolls we ordered were not great and I won't be coming back for it.  Way too much mayonnaise for my taste - it was an overwhelming flavor on ALL the rolls.  Didn't get any nigiri tonight - I'm thinking it'll be okay, since there's less moving parts.  ;)  The appetizers: The chicken wings were delicious!  Nicely seasoned, tender - but I typically don't go to a restaurant just for the apps.  But if I'm dragged here, I know what I'll be getting.  The service: Meh.  Took a long time for our app - it came at the same time as our sushi, and our drinks weren't kept filled, so...  The teppan looked pretty typical - but I can't comment on the food.  The show looked your average from across the room, but I believe it was cheaper than some other places, so maybe if you're looking for a value...  This place is close to work, and I might come back for a happy hour.  Or I might not.

I'd been wanting to try this place for a while, and I finally was able to drag the wife there on a not-too-busy Friday night.  The #2 was quite good - have to love prosciutto on a burger - then adding pesto, well, that's MY burger. Get yer own.  Cooked to a perfect medium-rare as ordered as was the wife's medium-well version of #3 (green chile, jack, chipotle, hold-the-avocado). The burgers are Plenty Big - go easy on the sides unless you are starving.   Speaking of sides, the onion rings and sweet potato fries were both very nicely done - not greasy, and very hot! I tried the Guinness milkshake, which while good, is not something I need to get again. The Guinness lent a hint of greater depth than just a regular chocolate shake, and was fun for the novelty, but not enough of a difference to repeat. The wife's strawberry shake was VERY good, and probably the way I'll go next time. The shakes are provided with the mixing cup - so you actually have two full servings worth (might split one for two people)!  As for the overall ambiance, we enjoyed the decor with the French wallpaper (I think of toile as having pastoral scenes, and this was just patterned - but nice), the semi-dim lighting, metallic ceiling and general decor.  The only thing to detract was the screeching metal music playing. I don't mind contrasts - but this was discordant.  The value was alright - we expected premium prices for the premium burgers, and will return, I just doubt it will sit high in the rotation.

Fantastic staff, they care about helping you get better. A well-rounded physical therapy clinic, they incorporate science-based myofascial release techniques with individually tailored rehab programs to get you where you want to be.  I especially like the hands-on approach (literally!) they take with each patient.  You aren't a number here, and the therapists will work with you and adapt their treatment depending on your progress and needs the day they see you - not blindly holding to a plan developed at the start of your treatment.  As a sports enthusiast, I was also pleased to learn that they play competitive sports themselves, and have experience with sports-related rehab.  Both my knee and back concerns have been addressed, and while I don't hope pain or injury on anyone, if you have it, you should try them out - they'll take care of you.

The decor is a bit spare, but the food more than makes up for it!  If I had to choose between a place decorating on a budget, versus cooking on a budget, I'd do the same thing PVB did - give it some kitschy yet modern touches but focus on the food.  First, the sweet potato tots are excellent!  Crispy outside, tender inside, and very tasty - if you like sweet potato fries definitely give these a try. (And if some maple syrup finds a way to your table - dip 'em!)  Homemade chips were great too.  The basic paradise CHZ is a very balanced burger - the brioche bun is perfectly toasted and I love the unusual options of havarti or smoked mozz in addition to cheddar.  They do the fixings a little differently too - pickled onions and cucumber are a fresh idea, and a nice change.  My only complaint was I ordered without either sauce - jalapeno ranch, or the 1000 island that I was given.  I dealt with it instead of asking them to remake the burger, but mentioned it when they circled round to find out how it was. They apologized and without asking comp'd a basket of the french toast fries!  Now, I don't know why the world has not discovered the mouthjoy created by these simple, delicious morsels before. Holy crap. Hot, dusted with powdered sugar, served with maple syrup. Holy moly, dear lord I want more of them now.  And now. {shudder} Already having withdrawal symptoms...  Fountain soda! They do have a gun now, for those of you who would like a fountain Coke and not just the canned selection or brewed iced tea.  So yes, we'll be back to try the specialty burgers, shrimp club and tacos - and the shakes.  And I'm looking forward to it.  (Hmm. French toast fries, dipped in a marshmallow malt?  Yup.  Gonna try that FOR SURE.)

First, Venezia's does an opening -well-. From the  inflatable Grand Opening monoliths (seriously thought they might be filming a remake of _2001_), to having all hands on deck to make it as efficient as possible (and they were slammed!) and having that staff well prepared with smiles and cheer - they won the opening.   And the staff weren't just happy, but helpful as well. Service was a little slow, but given the sheer number of people, probably as fast as was possible.   The new building looks great, nice atmosphere, comfortable space, appropriately lit, delicious smells, all good things.   The only downside to the visit was the crust is just not my favorite. The wife's pizza was a little underdone so didn't have that nice crisp we look for, and my calzone was a little tough and chewy.   On the other hand, the toppings were great (as a matter of fact the homemade meatballs _literally_ got a round of applause from the one year old!), sauce is good, like having ricotta as an option and portions were a good value for the money. I'm willing to come back and give the crust another chance.
