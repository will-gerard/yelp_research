Alright seriously if you rate AJ's less than 5 than you're a buffoon.  Seriously think about this for a minute.  AJ's offers top quality products and specialty items that you can't find at your typical supermarket.  IE. Langoustines.  Is the store pricey? Yes, but you're paying for top quality products so I don't mind.  Their cheese selections blows any main competitor away as well as their prepared food.  I could go on forever breaking down each department, but I will not bore you.  Shell out the few extra dollars and shop here, you won't be disappointed!

Just go here and get the Italian Sub.  It's fantastic!  Also they have real deli meats and cheeses, not Boar's Head.  What's not to love?!!

I will give S.o.S. a 4 star rating for now for two reasons. I have only tried two items from their menu. The pizza and the cheese calzone. Definitely a solid pizza and an awesome calzone. The only downside is that it is a little bit small and fills up quick. It's not a problem if you're doing carry out but if you're on your lunch break and want to sit down and enjoy your meal it can be difficult at times. They have great lunch specials and all the typical dishes that you will find at a basic Italian joint. Although I can't say for sure, if they make their dishes like their pizzas and zone's, I'm willing to bet they will be pretty solid. I guess I will have to go back pretty soon and try on for myself!

Ah, LGO you are a Hodge podge of confusion. It's a store, it's a restaurant, it's confusing. I understand of having a store of food based items and then having a dining area in it, like the Queen Creek Olive Mill, is a great example of this, but I don't understand how you can have a restaurant, have a beer cooler, and have kids toys for sale next to beer, ha ha. They have some really cool items for sale but there is no continuity of items for sale, IMO.  My friend and I ordered the classic Margherita pizza. I am a complete pizza snob, so I'm never really convinced on people's opinions of pizza until I actually consume it. All I have to say is that this pizza is pretty solid. Definitely not the best pizza I have ever had, but in no way was it the worst. I would go back here for pizza and not have any difficulty about it. LGO has a really relaxed vibe to it which I find appealing. If I'm in the neighborhood I will definitely come back, but I won't go out of my way to come here.

An Irish pub on St. Paddy's day must be done!  I came here on Paddy's day for a few beers and lunch.  This is a place I could see myself frequenting once a week.  It has a down to earth vibe to it even though its in Arcadia.  I had the Shepherds pie for lunch.  I wasn't a fan of it, but it wasn't god awful.  I've definitely had better.  I just wish you could smoke on the patio!

Just do yourself a favor and go here and get the sliders, they are fantastic!!  I think the soft and chewy roll is what makes them so damn addictive!!  I have actually never tried anything else on the menu because all I know is that when I go here all I want is sliders!!  The decor of this place is really cool as well.  All stuff Chicago sports.  Although I'm not a fan of Chicago I understand this place.  If a place like this existed in Phoenix that had all things Boston I would love it!  I really don't have much more to say though about the place since I have only tried one thing but I will say this.  The staff is friendly and if the the Cubs ever win the World Series, it's free sliders!!

Wow! I had such a hankering for Italian food, and Marcellino's treated me far beyond expectations. Growing up right outside of Boston, I went to the North End (Boston's Little Italy) quite a bit for authentic Italian food. I was skeptical as to what an Scottsdale authentic Italian restaurant would be. My first impression of Marcellino's was superb. A very somber and intimate setting. And listening to live entertainment. Already I was impressed.  For the life of me I cannot remember my servers name and I that's a let down because he was superb!! He made me and my company's night all the more enjoyable with his personality and his knowledge of the menu. What happened next was something that I have never seen before and it really added a class act to my experience here. He came to our table with a plate full of the pastas that were made for the day, with a detailed explanation of each type. Very impressive. He also went over each special of the night in great detail, leaving me with no questions to ask him.  After several minutes of glaring at the menu, and thinking about the dinner specials offered, I went with the dinner special of Lamb Ragu over Pappardelle.  My counterpart ordered their Fettuccine Contadina from their Handmade Pasta selection. After several more minutes of conversation and eating bread with a roasted red pepper spread, which was to die for, our meals came to us piping hot, and smelling of ecstasy.  My first bite, I was in love! This was incredibly good. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente, and who does not love freshly made pasta?! My Lamb Ragu was divine. I could have eaten about three plates of this dish myself, it was that good. My friends dish was also superb. Again freshly made pasta, with top quality produce, not overly done, which is the Italian way. Keep it simple. Although I didn't get a chance to have dessert, because I was stuffed from bread and pasta, I did see several desserts trailing through the dining room. They all looked to die for.  Marcellino's totally exceeded my expectations for authentic Italian food. I see too many Italian restaurants which typically serve all the same items, i.e. Chicken, Veal, Eggplant Parmesans, and Marsalas, but Marcellino's didn't offer these which was a sigh of relief, and makes me intrigued on going back and trying the other delights that they offer.  I would say that this place would be more suited for a date atmosphere than for big groups. It has a sexy, intimate vibe to it. Feel free to disagree with me on that. With all that being said, I will be back again, REAL soon! Enjoy!!

I have no business whatsoever being at a race track.  I know nothing about horse racing.  I was obligated to come for my friends birthday though otherwise I would never come here.  This place is dirty, out dated, and the crowd is dirty and dingy.  Never again!

I love sushi and I love this quaint tiny little place!  Although I haven't been here in quite some time I drove by this place the other day and thought of all the good memories I have had there and wanted to go in but I was on my way someplace so it was a disappointment that I couldn't stop and schoff down some delicous sushi.  What I really love about this place in the intimacy and you never feel intimidated while eating there.  For instance whenever I go to RA I feel as though I have a certain image to be even looked at in there.  That isn't so at Sekai.  The staff is there to provide you with the best meal possible and they always took the time to answer questions that may arrise.  That cannot be overlooked by anymeans.  This place is definitely good for groups and even a first date, I would say if you want to keep it low key.    With all that said, the prices are right, the sushi is delicious and the atmosphere is great.  I need to go back there again soon, real soon.

I typically tend to stay away from chain restaurants as often as possible.  I do have to say though, that I have been to several Outback restaurants thoughout the years and honestly I will say, I have never had a bad meal at any of them.  The quality of the steaks are pretty good, and it was cooked to a proper rare, so I can't complain about that.  It has a pretty extensive menu, if steak is not your thing, and I would have no problem going back to an Outback Steakhouse in the future.

I had a life changing experience today and that was of Hamachi Kama.  For quite some time now, after watching food programs that showcase Tuna collar, I have been dying to try it.  So in my research of finding restaurants that serve such this item I stumbled across Sakana.    From my first bite, I was in love.  The Hamachi lived up to its reputation!  A nice size piece of fish, grilled to perfection.  I devoured this dish and could ate about two more servings of this.  I also ordered some sushi pieces as well.  The sushi was standard issue.  It wasn't mindblowingly good, but it was not terrible.  It totally satiated my appetite.    The inside is a quaint and cute little place.  I'd say it would probable sit around 50 people.  The decor, is nothing too fancy, but it's not bland either, just the right mix.  They offered several different lunch specials and the portions were huge for the price.  Also they have two lists of special appetizers.  They have several items that are $.50 cents each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  And they have several items that are $1.00 each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  That's nice if you're curious to try something new.  What's an extra either 50 cents or a buck?    All in all, just go for the Hamachi Kama.  I will be back for sure just for this one item!

I really should give this 5 stars but I am going to give it 4 stars and you will find out at the end of this. I for one am not an outdoors person at all but this is a blast! I am a huge fan of day drinking and what's a better way than to float down a river for four hours and get your drink on? Get a group of friends together, tie up all your inner tubes and float away and all get drunk and cause pandemonium together. It's great. You get to take in the sites of the natural surroundings and the women (he he) and float through dirty and dingy water, lol. Sometimes you get a pretty sweet score as well, like free beers floating down the river from some schmuck who's cooler spilled, always a plus! Why I give this only 4 stars instead of 5 is the god damn 3rd degree sun burn you get. Even applying sun screen constantly you will still be in physical pain for a week from this skin singeing! I can overlook the scrapes and bruising but the sunburn is the absolute worst part of this experience but yet somehow I always go back every year, lol. A definite must do!

This Dos Gringos is definitely by far my favorite one of the several they have in the valley. Although it is in Scottsdale and I'm surrounded by Sdale douchebagery, I have always had a great time here. I don't care if I'm packed in here like a can of sardines, the sights make up for it if you know what I mean, he he. Whether it's day drinking or out at night. The food is actually really good, reasonably priced and great portions. There will be many more drunken adventures at this establishment for sure!!

This place is fun dive bar and it has a beer pong table.  What's not to love?  Nothing too special about this place but nothing bad about this place.  Actually this place is a nice break from the typical douchebaggery.  I don't go here too often but when I do I have always had a blast.  I would recommend it.

I really do enjoy my time every time I come here. This establishment reminds me of being back east, with its ambiance and vibe. I came here last week for my birthday and with good drinks, good food, and good company, I had a blast!! We had the crab dip, fish n chips, and bangers and mash. All of the food was quite delicious! What I like most about the open in the crowd. Yes, it is in Scottsdale, but it's not Scottsdale. The people who come here are down to earth, and not the uppity uptight pretentious people of Scottsdale, which I love. When you're here, you're family and everyone is willing to talk to everyone. And even the waitstaff is friendly and attentive. I wish I could frequent this place more often but I live rather far away. I will never have a problem if a friend suggests coming here for a night of drinking!!

Ahhh, a breath of fresh air! Being from MA, a highly populated Italian state, I grew up going to Italian groceries like this, and it made me a bit home sick.  A tiny little establishment inundated with products and heck they were even able to squeeze a couple of table in there for dining. The shelves are lined with numerous imported products from Italy, and not just pasta was a relief to see. Canned tomatoes, pasta, gnocchi, candy, cookies, etc.  Although I have not tried too many items on their menu, I have not had a single complaint about anything I have tasted.  The only thing that is missing is the smell.  I used to go to a place in Franklin, MA called "Ferraras".  Their original place was there for generations, and for generations it has had meats hanging, fresh meat being butchered, and the women in the back cooking up a storm.  You just walked in and were immediately hit with the aroma of 100 years of delicious treats.  Although Defalco's does not have that yet, I'm sure over time it will get to that level.

Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!

Ah the Marquee how I do enjoy this venue!  I'm not going to bitch about how I have to take my shoes off like so many people, get over it.  It takes 2 seconds.  This medium sized venue is perfect when you want to see a band you really enjoy in more or less in an intimate setting.  What I mean by that is that this venue is not too big nor is it too small.  It's just the right size and no matter where you are inside you have a good standing position (no seats inside).     What makes or breaks this place is the sound.  If the sound guy is doing the correct mix, the acoustics in here are pretty damn solid.  If the mix is bad, it's definitely going to put a damper on your night.     The inside is nothing special.  It's pretty much 4 walls with a stage, and a big stage at that.  I have never had a bad experience here and I actually really do enjoy attending shows here.  I can't wait for the next one!!

I really should give this place a zero.  Im going to give it one star only due to the fact that if you walk out of the bar and you're hungry this place is available.  Other than that I have tried this pizza sober and it is disgusting.  Never go here, it's bad.

Yes, I went there without a reservation, and it's true that you wait for a ridiculous amount of time if you don't have one (my wait was 3.5 hours), but in the end it was worth it.  The ambiance, the food, the open psudeo kitchen with the wood burning oven and the reasonable prices made my night.  The pizza was excellent.  The oven roasted vegetables were excellent.  My company was excellent.  Set aside my wait time I will definately go back but next time I will make sure that I have reservations.

I cannot state how much I hate Chase Field.  I grew up in Boston, and I went to a real stadium, Fenway Park.  That place will knock your socks off.  When I describe Chase Field to people, I say it's a mall with a baseball field in the middle of it.  There's no aura there, it has no personality, and it's usually empty, unless a popular team like Boston, or New York is in town.  For the life of me I do not understand why they have a damn pool there.  That has nothing to do with baseball.  It gets two stars simply since when I need my baseball fix, Chase is available.  Do yourselves a favor and just go to spring training games.  They're more fun, and cheaper.

Gay, gay, gay, oh and did I mention gay?  I really wish 0 stars was offered.  This place is terrible.  Pretentious people, over priced drinks, and a terrible vibe.  If you don't have money, you wont get anywhere in this place.  It's not fun and I will never go back.  The only thing that saves this place is the fact they serve booze.  I would never go to this place on my own, but I have been twice because of birthday parties and I had to get wasted just to deal with the crowd.  I don't want to write anymore because it's really pissing me off!!

What a fantastic music store!! They carry every type of music in here, as well as DVDs, records, posters, toys, magnets, and apparel. What I really love about Zia is that they carry Metal music. I usually cannot find any of the bands that I listen to at any other music store. So it's nice to know instead of going on a manhunt to find something that is more or less unique chances are that I can go here and usually find it. And if I can't find it here they have no problem ordering it for me. I've always enjoyed shopping here and will continue to do so as long as I live in this area.

One of the older hotels and casinos on the strip. As far as the casino goes, it has all the games you want to play. As far as the rooms go, they're forgettable. But for me this place works because I don't need anything fancy. I essentially need a place to store my luggage, sleep and bathe. For the price it cant be beat. You can usually get a room here during the week for $26.00 a night. I mean come on that's spectacular! If you want a basic place on the strip to stay, this place works out just fine.  I will say this though, this place is great for a family stay.  It has a huge arcade and several amusement rides for the family, so that is a definite benefit of your stay.

Mamma Mia you are exactly what I have been searching for in AZ!  This style of pizza is exactly the type that I have become accustomed to growing up in MA.  I have been searching the valley for years and I finally found east coast pizza.  Up until the other day Ray's pizza has been the closest I have found, but Mama Mia blows Ray's away, hands down.     Dough-5 stars    Sauce-5 stars    Cheese-5 stars     My friend has been telling me to try this pizza for a while now and he to is from MA, so he knows my flavor profiles pretty much better than anyone.  And upon my first bite, he was right.  This is exactly the style of pie we grew up with.  I'm kind of disappointed that I don't live closer otherwise I would have a serious Mama Mia's addiction, or maybe that's a good thing :)  I will be back soon!

I'm giving this place a 1 star only because 0 stars are not an option.  This place blows so much.  It's overpriced shitty service and I am surrounded by pretentious women, and the douchebaggery that is the Scottsdale men.  Ed Hardy/Affliction wearing 25K millionaires, who think they are the shit, when in all reality they are lame as shit!  I hope this place shuts down!

I am a big advocate of buffets.  I mean let's be honest who doesn't love a great buffet!  I know this is the biggest buffet, but it might be the biggest buffet in the world, but don't quote me on that one.  It's over 300 ft. of everything you could ever want!  The best part of it all is the quality of the food.  A big problem for me of mass producing the food is compromising the quality of the food.  I have been to this buffet several times and each time I went I have never had anything to complain about.  In fact I have had some food here that is actually better than some restaurants that I have been to.  After the regular food, don't forget about the dessert island they have.  Everything dessert possible is provided for you.  I have been to several other buffets through out Vegas and this one is hands down the best one!

This was my first Dim Sum experience outside of a Chinatown in several major U.S. cities that I have been to, and I have to say I was very content with my experience. The food brought me back to walking the streets of Chinatown (Boston) and searching for the best Dim Sum restaurant in that section of the city. The food I felt was really good, with the exceptional blunder, and real fresh. Overall very positive.  The service and the decor was the thing that brought my rating to a 4. Service was exceptionally slow. I have never been to a Dim Sum house where they weren't trying to push something on to you every five minutes. I had to wait a very long time for the cart to come around. I also requested shrimp paste around crab claws and the server went to put that request in the kitchen and he told me five minutes. 25 minutes of waiting and they finally came out to me. Eh, I can get over that. They have the ugliest bright orange seat cover in the world! That shouldn't bring the restaurant down, that's just my observation, and opinion. I definitely want to check out some other places for Dim Sum, but I know in the back of my mind if I want good Dim Sum, I know where to get it.

I'm giving this place 4 stars for two reasons only. 1. You have to walk back into the casino to use the bathroom, which sucks when you broke the seal, and 2. it's outdoors and in the summer time in Vegas being outside blows.  But enough with my complaints, this bar is definitely a good time. The atmosphere, the sites, and the live music is always a plus in my book. I would say that this place is much better suited for groups though. Not just you and your buddy hitting up the town. I have been here twice and each time I have had a blast. Let's be honest, it's Vegas, you can do and be anything you want to be!!

My dad took me here the other day and when we pulled up I was like wtf?  The building doesn't look appealing at all so I was thinking that the food will not be good at all.  To my amazement I was wrong.  We had the calamari appetizer and the all you can eat fish and chips.  The calamari was actually pretty damn good, and the fish was also pretty damn good.  I'm not a cole slaw fan, but there's was awesome!  There was a special of haddock parmesan.  One I have never even heard of that and two, that doesn't even sound appetizing in the least bit.  I didn't try it so I can't review that.  I'm actually intrigued to go back and try the other dishes that they offer.  I mean you don't think of Apache Junction of a dining destination, but this place was pretty damn good!

Alright, I have been visiting Dr. Coury's office for years now.  I have to say is that I am a medical snob.  I'm originally from Boston which is hospital capital of the world.  Only the best of the best work in Boston.  With that being said I am always skeptical about any other Dr. who have ever treated me outside of Boston, but I will say this, the Physicians Assistants and Dr. Coury himself, I am actually very impressed with.  They are knowledagble and very courteous to me the patient.  I have never had a single complaint while attending this practice, and if interactions continue the way that they do, I do not thing I will ever have a complaint.  I will totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a Primary Care Physician!

I went here today with a buddy of mine for lunch and it was definitely a very good meal. Overall quality was pretty damn good. The thing I loved the best about this place was that they have duck on the buffet line!! I have never seen this before and I love duck!! The sushi was OK, nothing spectacular, but I didn't expect anything less for buffet sushi. Would I go back? Yeah, I would go back.

Although, I do not come here that often, I am a big fan of this place.  It's an unpretentious Irish bar, that is a lot of fun.  Of all the proclaimed Irish bars that I have been to in the valley, this is the most Irish of them all.  There's nothing modern about this place, like most Irish bars, so it's nice.  I have only eaten here once and I had the fish and chips and it was quite good.  So if I'm in the neighborhood and I want a drink, I will definately stop on in here!!

I would've given 5 stars if they carried Duck Commander Duck Calls in store.  What can I say about BPS?  If you're an outdoors person, this is your one shop stop shopping experience.  They have everything you want and could ever need.  Yeah, a little pricey, but it's convenient!!

I have been eying this place for quite some time now considering one of my best friends has checked in here 28 times, and one of my other friends just discovered it and was ranting about it. So last night I had to give it a whirl.  Don't be thrown off by the building itself. Yes, it looks like a dive that would serve crumby food, but alas inside great things are being done! I had the classic gyro. Delicious!! Perfectly seasoned meat, a fantastic pita and fresh vegetables. What's not to love? You have the option of having either a salad or fries with your meal. I went with the french fries. These fries are DECEPTIVELY good!! They look like your typical frozen fries, which they are but somehow they are great and are seasoned with season salt, always a plus.  Man am I salivating right now just thinking about it. I would like to add that this place is value for its buck. The portions are huge and appropriately priced. I will be back for sure and sooner than later!!

So, I saw this place showcased on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate, so I decided to check it out on one of my day's off. Man was I glad I did!! This place was great! The building itself wasn't impressive, just a big metal building which was kind of misleading, but once you walk inside oh man! As soon as you walk in it is rows and rows of olive oil, wine, cook books, and cooking accessories. This place was packed to the brim. After browsing through the aisles I worked up an appetite and went to the back to get some lunch. After looking over the menu I tried the bruschetta platter. OK this didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. They offer 8 different types of bruschetta. They have a platter where you can order 3,5, or 7 different kinds. Well if you offer 8 why can't I try all 8?!! I was puzzled for about ten seconds and got over it. So I got the 7 platter one and bought the additional 8th. Their bruschetta was overall amazing! Great quality toppings on quality bread. I don't like hummus so I didn't like that one, heh.  I ended up ordering the sandwich that was showcased on the TV show and next to it on the menu there's a sign, showcased on the food network, so hell I had to get it. It is the kalamatta sandwich. The sandwich basically is an Italian sandwich but it was very, very tasty. Great meats on a great roll, I was glad I went with it. While devouring this sandwich, they have a window into their factory where they make their olive oil. That was a very plea sent, and interesting sight to see while eating a nice lunch.  After lunch I did a little bit more browsing through the store and found the olive oil tasting bar. That was frig gin sweet. I tried several of them, most I liked and some I didn't. I'm glad they had this sample station for me to try before I dropped the money on a bottle of oil just to find out that I didn't like it, always a plus in my book.  With all things said I would definitely go back to the Olive Mill, and hell since it is out of my way to get there, I don't mind driving out of my way to go there, it's that good!! I will definitely be back there in the immediate future!   P.S.  Just for a heads up the outside smells like shit, ha ha

There isn't much that you can say about a movie theatre.  They showcase movies before I can buy them on DVD.  So with that being said you really can't fault them for over charging for the concessions.  People will pay no matter what.  What I really do enjoy about this theater though is that it is always clean, and there's hardly ever a crowd here.  Always a plus to be able to get the seats that you want.  With all this being said, it's a theater, I go for one purpose and that satiate my needs.

I came here yesterday with my friend for lunch.  As of now I will give The Mission 4.5 stars out of 5 only because we did not have any entrees, we split several appetizers, so I can't give that extra half star or even maybe take that half star away.     We split the brisket torta, which was heavenly.  After my first bite I was in love.  The aji amarillo sauce I could spread all over everything I eat.  Next we had the Almejas Al Vapor and all I have to say is that this soup is transcendental.  I have never tasted anything like this before.  The broth is a yellow pepper base and I never knew you could get this type of sublime flavor from a yellow pepper.  Clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo, and roast corn.  Please bring me more of this delicious soup!!!     Then our bartender / waiter brought us out a complimentary order of the grilled street corn.  I do have to say that I am not a fan of spicy food whatsoever but the chile paprika and cojita sauce was done so tastefully that I extremely enjoyed it.     The decor, is intimate.  This is a place you would love to take someone to impress them.  Candle holders carved out of Peruvian sea salt, a classy act right there.  Somber atmosphere, at tentative and attractive waitstaff.  Attractive food and an all around great time.  I will be back soon and if not for anything but the soup I will be a very, very happy man.

So I came here yesterday based on recommendations and reading fellow yelp reviews. I was not to be disappointed food wise. My friend Lyz and I split and Antipasto and a cheese pizza. The antipasto was great! Eight thick slices of mozzarella cheese, slices of salami, olives, roasted red peppers, and a basket of bread. My only complaint that I can overlook is that the peppers are served cold. It would've been better if they were hot. Just and oversight that I got over quickly, heh.  Then the pizza... Oh man was it good. A 16 inch thin crust pizza. That seems like a lot, but with thin crust pizza one person can definitely finish it. The dough was great. The bottom and the crusts was crispy and soft and chewy in the center. The sauce was definitely solid. Not too sweet and not too tangy, just right. The cheese was just right. The cheese placement was spot on. Not too much, and not too little. All around a damn good pizza.  I have to give props to my waiter as for he was spot on as well, with one minor slip up, which I'm not sure is his fault. My pizza and antipasto came out at the same time. Eh, oh well.  What didn't impress me was the inside of the restaurant. I know Grimaldi's has several locations, in several states and sort of a pseudo chain restaurant. It seems as though they could've designed the interior a lot more comparable to that of a New York pizza joint. The inside was kind of too new/bland at the same time if that makes any type of sense? Yeah they had some pictures of New York, but you definitely know that you are in AZ.  Oh before I forget I also had a cannoli, that was pretty damn solid if I must say. It wasn't the greatest one I have ever had, nor was it the worst. I would get it again for sure. Overall I will be back to Grimaldi's to stuff my face again, and a definite stop for anyone who has never been there!

Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close.  It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!

OK, I'm just like everyone.  Extremely hesitant when it involves anything in Apache Junction.  But alas, I was shockingly surprised to find that I actually enjoyed this place.  Unfortunately I live in Gold Canyon so my dining options are limited and I was craving a Gyro and I didn't not want to drive at least 30 mins west to get one.  I have been driving by this place for years and I finally decided that it was time to actually give it a shot.     This is a quaint little place, nothing fancy, just down to earth little eatery, with walk up counter ordering and sit down service.  What I really enjoyed was when I walked up to the counter you can see into the kitchen and it was actually really clean and you can watch as your food is prepared, always a plus for me.  So far this place is looking pretty good.  Picture menu above the counter was pretty informative with the exception of most of the items were not priced, which I thought was strange, but I got over it, heh.     Now to the important part, the food.  I ordered the classic Gyro sandwich and Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  The Gyro was actually pretty tasty and presented quite simply with kebab meat, Tzatziki sauce, lettuce, and raw white onion, wrapped in paper.  It also came with a side of fries, which were the standard frozen variety, so nothing special, but not bad at the same time.  The Dolmas were pretty good as well.  I think there were about six of them plated on a bed of lettuce, a couple slices of cucumber, a couple pieces of feta cheese and several olives.  Definitely not the best Dolmas I have ever had, but certainly not the worst either, but no complaints.     The value of this place is solid.  I got the Gyro, the Dolmas, and a soda for $13 and change.  It's definitely a place to grab a solid meal.  It's quick, it's affordable and it's conveniently located to me.  I will be back again in the future for sure!

I finally made it to Posh this past Thursday night for restaurant week. All I am doing right now is kicking myself for not coming here earlier. I really don't know what to add to a Posh review that has not been already stated. Definitely sit up at the counter and watch them cook. Such a better experience than sitting at the tables.  Here are some of the items I had the pleasure of enjoying.   Cantaloupe gelee  Endive Salad  Pumpkin Soup  Foie Gras  Shrimp with some type of tart that I couldn't tell what it was  Duck Confit  Kangaroo  Chocolate Mouse  Pistachio cheesecake (pretty sure non-bake)   I will say this. This was my first time trying Foie Gras, and if I never had it again I would be OK with that. Everything else was perfect though, The concept, the vibe of Posh is amazing. Cheers to you Josh. I will be back!!!

I stayed here last Tuesday night for the first time.  Overall I was pretty impressed.  A nice and modern hotel.  A full bar in the lobby, and also a coffee shop, where you can also get pastries.  The design of the hotel is nice and also very clean.  The room was very nice.  Definately not that nicest room I have ever stayed in, but I enjoyed it.  It had an awesome big screen tv in it!  The hotel is in a good location, and I would have no quams ever staying here again!

I can tell you what I'm not a fan of, country music.  What I am a fan of though is hot cowgirls!!  On that note, this is a huge venue and it can be a hell of a lot of fun!  Be prepared to be bumped all night by people.  They pack this place in.  If you can try to rent a cabana, that's your best bet not to get banged up.  This place is more of an eye candy spectacle than anything else I would say.  This is not my go to spot, but I'm more than down to come here if someone suggested it.

I have been here several times now, and last Friday was the last time I was here for KISS and Motley Crue.  Overall this is a nice facility.  My one real complaint is that there is not enough restrooms for the amount of people who are here.  Fortunately enough I have never had to sit in the lawn section, thank god lol.  Damn good size stage and a pretty solid audio system.  The real drag of this place is going to concerts in the summer time.  It sucks!!!  So be cautious of that!!

I'm definitely torn with this review. Recently I watched episodes of No Reservations and Bizarre Foods. They were both in Puerto Rico and they both showcased Mofongo and I became intrigued. With the help of yelp I succeeded in finding a Puerto Rican restaurant.  I ordered the Pork Mofongo, with a side of yellow rice and pigeon peas. Man was it a big plate of food. I tried the pork first, and it was divine. Next was the thing I specifically came here for,...the Mofongo. It tasted really, really good, although I think the plantains could have been fried just a bit longer. The same deal was with the rice. If it was cooked just a minute or two longer it would've been perfect! What I really enjoyed was I have never had any of these types of flavors before, and it was fantastic!  As far as the ambiance of the restaurant, it lacks in that department. It's located in a run down tiny strip mall, and the inside of the restaurant is really bland. Only 9 tables in the entire place!! And what video footage I have seen on PR, this seems accurate. What I will give credit to is the amount of pictures they had on the walls of PR showcasing their homeland.  If you have never had Puerto Rican food before definitely take a trip here. I most likely would've given the food a five star rating, but since this was the only time I have tried Mofongo, I can't base it on anyone Else's. But I will say this. I will be back at El Coquito to try the rest of their menu!

I love when my preconceptions are proved wrong. I have actually heard a lot about this place and I know what Pho is but actually never tried it until yesterday. Walking up to this place, you have the misconception that this place will not be that good because it is on the end of a run down strip mall and you think to yourself if the outside looks likes this how good could it be inside? Much to my amazement, my ignorance turned to bliss.  Upon walking in the inside was much bigger than I thought it was going to to be, it was packed and everything was very clean, a pleasant surprise. I ordered the shrimp spring rolls and the Pho, that consisted of tripe, meatball, and brisket. The spring rolls were divine. Nice crisp, fresh, clean, and aromatic flavors. I could have ate about eight of these things. Upon finishing the spring rolls, I knew it was a sign of good things to come.  Then came the Pho. Realistically, Pho is a soup, and I didn't understand how a soup could be perceived at phenomenal. Once again I was wrong. I tried the broth first, a mouth full of deliciousness. The rice noodles were divine, the meatball I thought was OK though, and the brisket was a little tough, but that is too be expected when it's sitting in hot broth all day. But overall a more than solid bowl of awesomeness, and I was a happy camper. What element I think I loved the most was that the Pho was filling, but you don't feel like you overate. A filling meal that has a very light touch to it, which I enjoy.  The service was a little clumsy, but I can oversee that, since they delivered on the meal which is what were really there for. I'm am going to stick with giving this place a four star rating simply due to the fact that I have never had Pho before yesterday and I don't know whether or not I have had the cream of the crop, or if there is better Pho in the valley. I guess I will have to try more Pho elsewhere, but I will be back to Pho Thanh.

Pretty dope complex.  Too rich for my blood but I do have a Dr. friend who lives here and he showed me around.  Definitely a well up kept facility.  The condos are very nice and I only saw a one bedroom condo but it was quite spacious.  The location of Optima is sweet.  Just a stones throw away to the nightlife of old towne!!

OK so this will be a complete/incomplete review of FnB and you will understand what I mean by this shortly. I came here last night for my first time. First let me tell you that FnB is closed on Tuesday nights but will open for private events, which is totally cool in my book. Last night was a surprise birthday party for my friend set up by his girlfriend, (what a great gf!). Since this was not one of their regular nights I have to make this clear, I did NOT taste anything from their menu, so that's where the review is kind of incomplete.  FnB did a showcase of a cheese sampler. I would have to say that at least 20 different types of cheese's were offered for us to try, with many side dishes to accompany the cheese. Just to name a few cheese's there were cheddar, bleu, goat, etc... Some of the side dishes were sausage, beets, garbanzo beans, couscous, melon, and prosciutto, just to name a few and help give you an idea. I for one have never been to a cheese tasting before and after last night I'm slapping myself in the face for never going to one in the past.  The quality of the cheese was amazing, although there were some that I was not found of. The side dishes were amazing and some of them I was not found of. Not that they weren't prepared correctly, I'm just not a fan of everything. But overall, I could not have been more pleased with what was presented to me.  I will definitely have to say that the thing that I was most happy with was the design of the place. FnB has a open kitchen. Any other restaurant that I have ever been to with an open kitchen the, all the guest are seated and the open kitchen is in the back. The complete opposite is done here. The open kitchen is in the middle, the main focal point and the seating is done around that. Totally cool I felt. It really gave you the feeling that they were cooking for you. Like as though you were watching a relative in the kitchen cook and you know that they are cooking just for you. A totally rad concept I thought.  The charm of this place was also appealing. Multi colored tile flooring and the dining room I would say is capable of holding 50 patrons. I think at one time we were at 30 patrons. As far as the staff goes, they were all really sweet, and I didn't get the feeling that any of them were pissed that they had to come in on their day off. They were all very accommodating and you could tell that they wanted us to have a great time! Hell, the head chef was actually on a plane when we started our meal and she came straight to the restaurant from the airport. Total commitment on her part and a class act I thought.  Overall I had such a great experience here last night! I have no complaints whatsoever. I cant wait to go back and actually try something from their menu. If what they offered me last night was that good, I can only imagine what I will experience when I go back there. And definitely sooner that later!! Enjoy!!

Wow, just wow. I had dinner here last night and this is my first time coming here and trying their menu. My previous experience was for a special event and a cheese sampling menu. All I have to say is my god, I'm kicking myself in the rear for not coming here sooner and enjoying the delicacy that is FnB.  My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees. The house pulled mozzarella, and the lamb riblets. These appetizers were amazing! The mozzarella came on a bed of white beans and tomatoes with grilled bread, stunning. The lamb riblets, were out of this world and it came with a cucumber salad. I couldn't tell what type of seasoning was on the lamb, but seasoned ever so perfectly.  For our entrees we ordered the lamb, and the duck. The lamb tenderloin cooked a perfect medium rare came with an assortment of grilled zucchini, squash and potatoes. The duck breast again came perfectly grilled medium rare on a bed of rice with chorizo, and I'm not positive, but I think some liver was thrown in, superb.  If it's available definitely sit at the counter and watch them prepare the food. Luckily I was right in front of the grill and I was the master of the grill, Charlene perfectly preparing meats and vegetables. I have to give high recommendations for Pavle as well, as I was lucky enough to have the pleasure of having him being my server. A very outgoing, down to earth person and we exchanged some stories and some jokes. That just added to the experience and the ambiance of the whole restaurant which I love. A quaint, intimate setting, that's not pretentious, where everyone inside is enjoying there company and the delicious food. I totally want to go back at this moment. It wont be long before the staff will be seeing me again! P.S. this restaurant would be perfect to take someone to on a first date!

This place is only worth two stars. It gets 2 because of the convenience for me. I live right down the street. So if I can't get into my regular PCP practice I go here for basic illnesses. Although the place is quite quaint, it seems as though the doctors here only know how to prescribe Prednisone. Prednisone does not cure all!!! I have had to convince them several times with medication that I know work on me. I know my body better than those doctors so they should listen to me. Eh oh well typical doctors thinking that they know everything. They also have an on site pharmacy which is actually pretty convenient and usually for less than Walgreen's, Fry's etc. So in all reality if I don't have a major illness just a simple cold I will go here but for something with more severity I will always go to my PCP.

I have only been here a few times because there isn't a lot of dining options living in Gold Canyon.  The pizza is a frozen dough, and is edible, but nothing special.  The chicken wings are actually pretty good.  The calamari is a breaded frozen product.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say nothing here is home made.  This place pretty much satiates hunger pains, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

So the is my first yelp review and I hope it's enjoyable for all of you.  Last week I met up with a friend who I haven't seen for several months for lunch.  We attempted to attend a restaurant in Old Town, Scottsdale for lunch, and much to my dissaray we arrived too late.  We were tossing around ideas and he mentioned "Pomo Pizzeria"  I wasn't really in the mood for pizza but trusting my friends judgement (who is a much bigger foodie than myself, I knew he would not of steered me in the wrong direction.)  As were walking in and I'm looking around, I have heard "Sexy" as and adjective when people talk about restaurants.  I myself have never used this, nor really knew what it meant, heh.  But looking around I would use "Sexy" to describe this place.  The place was not too big, nor too small, had an excellent vibe to it.  Enjoyed the open view of the fire burning brick oven, and they had a wall size picture of a street in Italy.   We sat outside which is a pro in AZ.  How many other people get to enjoy lunch outside in December where they live?  Upon reviewing the menu I wasn't too sure of some of the toppings that would be involved with the pizzas.  I'm a traditionalist when it comes to pizza.  Basic toppings, cheese, mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, etc.  And in my opinion when trying a new pizza for the first time you should try cheese first.  Let's face it.  You can put all kinds of toppings on a pizza, but if you can't make a classic, yet simple cheese pizza, then you can't make pizza, IMO.    I decided to stray away from my traditionalist ways and try something I guess would be "exotic" to the guy from New England, (Boston to be more precise.)  I went with their "Parma" pizza.  It is topped with Arugula, Prosciutto, and shaved Parmesan cheese.  All I could say was "wow!" after my first bite.  This pizza was fantastic.  From the dough, to the sauce, the fresh Arugula, prosciutto, and the freshly shaved parmesan.  My friend ordered one of their Paninis which also looked fantastic!!  Although neither one of us tried each other's food(why I don't know?)  I knew we were both satisfied with our meals.    It's very appealing to know that their is a great place to enjoy great pizza in AZ.  It is also very appealing that living a convivial life when it's not always readily available to you is enjoying for me and my pallette!

I came here on Friday with a dire craving for Soba Noodles. I have never had Soba Noodles, before and I have been yearning it since watching a rerun of Iron Chef Japan the other night. Upon glancing over the menu I decided to order Shrimp Tempura Soba, $6.95 a Squid Salad $3 and bought a soda. All of which came to $15 bucks with tip. Not a bad deal at all IMO.  I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I can't give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I don't know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as I'm concerned it didn't disappoint. The one odd thing I thought though was that I did not see one Japanese employee in there. Kind of quirky, but oh well. This is a solid meal at a good value.

I festival dedicated to Ostriches and only two Ostriches, really?  This was a typical fair.  Over crowded with middle and high schooler's, people bumping into you, long ass lines and breathing in dirt.  Why anyone would think this would be fun is beyond me.

I have been dying to try this place for months now, and luckily yesterday I finally had the chance to go downtown and eat at Nobuo, and trust me it did not disappoint!!  My friend and I split the Short Rib Steamed Buns as an appetizer.  Let me tell you this, I could eat the shit out of this all day long!  From the first bite I was in love.  Succulent meat in a light steamed bun, hmmmm.     Next my friend had the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, which unfortunately I did not try but it looked grand, and he had no complaints about it whatsoever.  I went with the Okonomiyaki.  Wow, just wow.  I have had Chinese Scallion pancakes, but this Japanese pancake was out of this world good.  I have never had anything that has ever tasted like this before.  I guess it could be best compared to an up scale Egg Foo Young.  Same concept, but with much higher quality ingredients.  What I really cannot get over was the price.  Each dish was only $10 bucks, a bargain considering the quality of food that you get.  I will put it this way.  I live in Gold Canyon, and I am willing to make the commute for these dishes again.  That sentence tells it all right there!

So I had my first experience with Tapas last night. Our first blunder was with the host. We didn't have reservations and they gave us this look, like we didn't belong. Bad first impression I thought and I was like well we will just sit at the bar then, which I find better anyways, and they complied. The bartender was very informative with the menu and gave us some suggestions, so he made up for the host. After a round of drinks our food arrived and the presentations was very aesthetically appealing. After trying a single bite of each dish, all I have to say is that the food was fantastic!! A friend and myself went here with no expectations and we were delightfully pleased on the type of meal in which we received. We split 4 dishes. We had a shrimp dish, a lamb, a chicken, and a squid stuffed with cuddle fish. The food was divine.  My only real complaint about that place is how loud it is. They have a live band. I'm not sure if it's every night or only on the weekends. Though the band was exceptionally good and they had a dancer it was so friggin loud. My friend and I were pretty much screaming at each other the entire night and we were literally right next to each other sitting at the bar. That's why I will give this place a 4 stars instead of 5. I will definitely be back though. Maybe for lunch instead of dinner though.

I came here for a pre dinner drink before going to FnB.  My date and I went in and went straight to the bar.  I'm not going to bitch because I wasn't greeted by anyone, I could care less.  We sat at the bar, and sat, and sat.  Numerous servers walked by with no type of acknowledgment or to even maybe get the bartender.     The bartender finally came and showed no interest in serving us.  After enjoying our drinks I asked to close out my tab.  That took 20 minutes.  It was only my company and myself and two other patrons at the bar.  I gave my card as soon as he brought the check.  It actually took so long that I left my friend at the bar to sign my name so I could run down and go to FnB so they didn't think I was bailing on my reservation.     Now I'm not being overly sensitive, I'm just pointing out that this was piss poor service and exactly opposite of how the hospitality business should be run.  Based on my experience on just trying to get a drink, I have no desire to actually come here and try the food.

This whole complex is great!  If the DBacks were to actually play regular season games here, I'd be more inclined to go to because I do not like Chase Field.  Just walking up to the actual stadium you walk right by numerous playing fields, and batting cages and at any given time you can watch the teams practice.  The aesthetics of this place is really clean.  Not a bad seat in the house and it's cheap!  My only complaint and I'm nit picking because I'm a traditionalist when it comes to ball park food.  I don't want to see Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  That's not baseball!!

I drove by this place 3 times yesterday trying to find it.  They need a much more improved way of advertising there business. I came here yesterday during a working lunch.  My first thoughts while walking through this place was gastropub.  The set up and the decor all suggested my initial thoughts.  After glancing over the menu I decided my decision was conclusive.  We decided to sit outside because let's face it one of the pros of living in Phoenix is that you can have lunch outside in January.  It was a beautiful day.     My counter part ordered the Reuben sandwich, which actually looked pretty darn tasty.  I ordered the Windsor burger, topped with caramelized onions and cheese.  Even though my burger was overdone to my request of rare I still ate it anyways because 1. I don't like to waste food, and 2. it was still pretty darn tasty.  The french fries could definitely use improvement though.  They were just blah.     As far as service goes, my server was a pimp!  Very charming and pleasing.  Although it did go a little overboard with the attentiveness of filling up water glasses constantly, not by my server though.  All around I had a pleasant experience with Windsor and if I'm ever in the area again and want to get a solid bite to eat, I wouldn't hesitate to come back.

It's places like these that really makes me hate going out in Scottsdale.  A pretentious, somber lit establishment where waitresses look like Dita Von Tease.  The one pro of this place is the lit up menus.  Those are pretty rad.  I will not be coming back!!

Last week my friend came here before we had dinner at Distrito.  I really cannot give an accurate assessment of this place based on the fact that we only had two appetizers.  We ordered the deviled eggs, and the tater tots.  The eggs, although very good, I have had better.  The tots on the other hand were hands down the best tater tots that I have ever tasted in my life!  I have no clue what they did to these things but they are addictive!  Hopefully soon I will be able to go back and have an entree and be able to provide more information for all of you!

Iron Chef Jose Garces Restaurant in Scottsdale? Yes please!!!  I took my mom here Tuesday for her birthday lunch.  The lunch menu is rather limited compared to the dinner menu, which is to be expected, but nonetheless it still delivered.     I began my meal with Chips n Salsa.  Damn good Salsa and solid chips.  Next up were the Nachos Ignacio.  All I have to say is that these were the most unique nachos I have ever eaten in my life, and for the price of only $5 dollars I have no idea how they are not losing money on this dish!.  A pile of chips loaded with caramelized onions, queso mixto, roasted green peppers, olives, red chiles, jalapenos, micro greens and to top it off radishes.  I have never seen a radish on nachos before in my life.     Next was the Camarones Ceviche.  A very, very good shrimp ceviche in a spicy tomato broth, on top of a avocado mouse, a slice of avocado and fried plantain chips.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the avocado.  That's because I personally do not like avocado, but that is just me and not a bash on the dish.  I would get it again in a minute.     Now it's time for the main courses.  My mom had the Costillas.  These BBQ spare ribs were absolutely delicious.  Sweet and succulent pork meat, mmmm.  The ribs were served on top of a chipotle-cider mustard which was great.  Also 6 tortillas.  I had the Carne Asada.  This skirt steak was grilled a perfect rare served over mole coloradito.  This mole was out of this world good!!  Also this was served with 6 tortillas.     I was too full to try a dessert, but if they're anything like the other two courses I had, I'm sure they will be great.  The best thing about lunch time here is the Blue Demon express lunch deal.  Two courses for $15 bucks and that includes a fountain drink or water.  2 courses $15 bucks for cuisine like this? Sign me up!!  Such a great deal considering my Carne Asada is $14 a la carte.     My only glitch with the restaurant was with the theme.  It was very confusing.  I understand the central and southern American atmosphere that the restaurant is trying to do, but there was no cohesiveness to it.  Just very erratic.  This is me just nit picking though and feel free to disagree.  Oh and for the life of me I cannot remember my servers name, but she was an absolute sweetheart.  I cant  wait to go back there again soon and dine on some more additional Iron Chef Jose Garces offerings!!

I am not usually a fan of fast food, but I will give Raising Cane's a pretty solid score.  It is very clean inside and very attentative service.  A very limited menu offering but solid food.  The chicken is moist and succulent and the fries are the typical frozen fries.  You do have to wait a few minutes for your food though.  They are cooking it a la minute (to order).  I am pleased with these guys so I will go back!

I worked here for a month and a half.  This place isn't what it's cracked up to be.  The place is clean, I will give it that, but it's definitely not my go to place for sandwiches.  They only offer cold sandwiches and the quality isn't that great.  I'd go other places.

Charleen and Pavle have done it again.  Blowing us away with outstanding food.  I came here on opening day, and I can't believe it has taken me this long to write anything about it.  This quaint little place, I would say about 30 seats is such a delight.  I going to say Pavle should earn a Michellin Star just on service alone, ha ha.  He knows exactly what to do the make the customer feel comfortable dining in his restaurant.  He did the same for me when I went to FnB.       Glancing over the tiny menu, only 6 offerings, Pavle suggested that I try a Cheese and fruit board that wasn't listed on the menu.  So I trusted his opinion.  For the life of me I don't remember what type of cheese it was, but it was fantastic!  I could eat the hell out of that all day long.  It also came with bread, dates, walnuts, and a fruit mustarda.  A great way to begin the meal.     I ordered the Jidori chicken sandwich which came with giardiniera.  Let me tell you this chicken sandwich was a mouthgasm.  God I'm craving it right now.  Succulent chicken with veg and Manchengo cheese, hmmm.  I don't like giardiniera, so I can't fault them for that.  I understand the combination, it's just not for me.  So next time I will just get the sandwich.     Although I am not a wine drinker I usually still look at the wine menu.  Baratins was pretty darn expansive.  I can't tell whether its impressive or not though, heh.  The bottom line of Baratin is that if you love FnB food, but at a fraction of the price come here and you will not be disappointed!!

I came here several weeks ago, and overall was pretty impressed.  It's a very nice establishment with a huge menu, that is very reasonably priced for what you get.  My mom and I had pasta dishes, and they were both around $10 and for the amount of food I received and the quality, I was pretty impressed.  Also when I checked in on Foursquare, we received a free garlic spread.  That was sweet!!  I would have no problems going back here in the future.  Oh also, they have an open kitchen.  I love that aspect of restaurants.  You can see how clean the kitchen is.

As far as a gas station/ convenience store QT is as good as it gets.  No matter which store that I go to, it's always clean!!!  Can't say that about too many other gas stations.  Also a huge plus, is that the bathrooms are always clean!!  QT is the only option for dropping deuces, when you have to go and not home!!
