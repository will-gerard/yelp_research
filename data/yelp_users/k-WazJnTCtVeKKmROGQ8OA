Consistent hours, not like Rito's right down the road.  More meat in their green chile burritos than Rito's.

Ordering a lei for my daughter's graduation.  Rhonda was super helpful and even took time to ask what color my daughter was wearing to ensure the flowers matched and/or were visible against the color of her gown. Keep it local!

Service is good but they always seem to run out of food when I am there. Never have chicken cooked and I always have to wait for them to cook more. Addressed it with the supervisor who apologized and gave me a free meal.  Last night 04/22/15 they were out of Tortillas.  Boo!

The kids say that the only thin bad about this place is that they don't serve pepsi... hahaha! We had 2 fry bread lunch specials and a plain fry bread.  The plain one has the option of adding toppings which include honey, powdered sugar, cinnamon,  cinnamon sugar, pb and j and such. Yummy!

I'm a fan of Little Saigon so when this opened up I had to try it! I drive out of way to eat here so that should say a lot

Although I have only checked in here 2x I've  returned more than that amount after my 1st experience. Hoping my family does not read this and ask why I didn't bring them with me or why I did not bring some home.  I have loved everything I have eaten here thus far: egg rolls, spring rolls, potstickers, noodle salad bowls (various combinations) #1, #3, #4, #5, #8 fresh  squeezed limeade, mango smothie, and SNOW! Living in this hot desert climate you can imagine why the last mentioned is amazing as a dessert!
