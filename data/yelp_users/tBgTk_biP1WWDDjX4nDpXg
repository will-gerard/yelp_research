I have never had poor service until today. I feel I have a unique situation and feel wronged by this company.  I purchased snow boots for an upcoming trip to Europe.  3 days into my trip the sole of the shoe separates from the boot at the stitching.   I have no other option but to find a local store and buy new boots.  I have limited luggage space and by no means have room to pack a broken faulty set of snow boots in my luggage with my new ones.  So I leave them in the hotel trash.  I come home and go to Macy's and plead my case and so the photographic evidence I had taken since I I don't have the boots and was told no merchandise no return.  I understand that's how it usually works but this is unique.  There were no Macy's I saw in Belfast where I was.  I couldn't cart the shoes around the rest of the trip.   I am out for a 90 dollar pair of style & co boots,   The money I spent on the new boots (clarks) which lasted the whole rest of trip no problem.  My vacation time spent finding new ones and an obviously wasted trip to Macy's to plead my case.  Thanks for nothing

Thanks for nothing         Not because of this review but because I emailed customer service I was contacted and able to plead my case.   They stood by their managers original decision as they should back their managers but understood the difficult circumstances and too care of me.   Thank you for your time and understanding
