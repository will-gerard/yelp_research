This shop is a godsend for bicycle enthusiasts in Central Phoenix! For service, parts, accessories, and buying a bike, this is the place to go! The shop is mainly centered around mountain biking but they know their road bikes and cruisers too.   Some people get intimidated at local bike shops by "bike snobs" that condescend to novices, but Slippery Pig is not that place. The staff are helpful to beginners and still can handle the finicky experts. Regular customers are treated like family!

Absolutely horrendous! The apathy of the Genius Bar is unparalleled to anything I have experienced anywhere. I'm considering from switching from Apple products so I'm not held hostage by these condescending jerks!

This is one of my hands down favorite bike shops in the Valley. It's not my LBS, but I use it when I can.   It has a great variety of bikes and loads of parts and accessories. The service is superb and there are no "bike snobs". The staff are amazingly friendly and welcome! I stop by when ever I'm nearby!

Rosie's is by far the best pub/restaurant in Central Phoenix! Some of the best staff and friendly regulars! Also a great place to watch CelticFC matches!

Best British pub in the entire valley! Or perhaps the entire southwest US. Great selection of good craft beers and an amazing menu. The best place to watch Liverpool FC!

Just ridiculous. Wait staff was some of the worse I ever had. It wasn't due to her being new or untrained but just completely apathetic. I used to work in a bar so I'm not unsympathetic to the trade and am usually forgiving of poor service, but it was like this a few more times before I decided it was not worth it to return despite the amount of sports I get to watch at once.  Perhaps this is just a place for lecherous men to stare at skimpily dressed adolescent girls, rather than a sports bar. And perhaps that was the problem, the times I was there it was to watch a game and not fawn over the server, and for that my table and I received poor and indifferent service.   Trade the big screen for better service and watch your sporting events at a real bar. This place sucks unless you like processed food, and crappy beer served to you with incompetent contempt.

This was very cool!!!! It was certainly one of the better holiday light displays ever. Definitely a lot better than some of the ones I seen at amusement parks like Hersheypark. The camel rides is a nice touch for the holidays. The only complaint I heard was from the staff on the lack of variety in the Xmas music. We will be going back a few times over the holidays.
