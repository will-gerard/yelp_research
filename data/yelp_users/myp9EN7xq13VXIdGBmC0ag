The employee at the jewelry counter could of not been more rude! First went to a different Walmart to get a battery for a watch that I needed the next day for work. They were out of stock. Had to go to this stupid Walmart to get one. Jewelry girl must of woke up on the wrong side of the bed 01/26/16. The girl needs more customer service training OR a less stressful position.

FAILURE OF COMMUNICATIONS!!  That was their excuse!! I went to this Big O to get a tire fixed and rotate them. Tom, sales clerk. Charged me for a oil change that I never asked for. Nonetheless,, I needed one so I didn't say anything. I left with Tom telling me my tire had a nail and they plugged it. I left and went home. Two hours later as I was leaving for work, the same tire in the same location was nearly flat! That just told me that they didnt fix my tire OR rotate them! Gimped my car back to Big O, for them to tell me that the tire had a nail in a location that couldnt be fixed. Therefore they didn't rotate them or plug the tire. So basically,, I went to a flipping tire store for a oil change that I didnt ask for and nothing was done that I did asked for!! Six workers standing around the lobby with nothing to do! So how could "Failure of Communications" happen? How could they let me leave with a nail still in my tire and tell me they fixed it! Women Beware of this Big O!!

My husband and I went here last night for a nice celebration dinner. We sat at the bar. The service and the bartender's were nice. My husband ordered the salmon with zucchini and I ordered the chicken Alfredo with a salad. My husband loved his salmon I got a taste and it was great. Now back to my dish. My salad tasted like fish and my pasta was dry. I asked for a side of Alfredo sauce. At that point I was done eating so I poured the sauce in my to go box and thought this would make great leftovers. Guess not! I heated up my pasta and it was nothing but an oily mess! Talk about cutting corners, no wonder why the sauce was so thin.. it was all oil... Won't make that oily mistake twice. Hope I don't get sick from all that oil!
