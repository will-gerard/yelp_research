Service was excellent. We loved our food. Probably the best pancake I ever had. Eggs and potatos perfect. Coffee good diner style. Love this place and the people.

Ate here last night. My son had the orange chicken and I had the lemongrass chicken. We both ended the night with upset stomachs and painful trips to the bathroom. We both had sweet and sour soup which was funky tasting as well as the crispy bean appitizer.   Our server was nice (her first day of training) but the service was so slow. We were there two hours. They also did not clear the table after each new meal delivery.  I can't return to this place

Went here tonight on a date night but where to begin. Wait, wait, wait was the theme.  Finally took our drink order. No beer! Bread was cold and cheap tasting- took forever to take our order-  Never offered us water- Food was bland and way below par for Scottsdale Italian-  Took over two hours to get through the whole ordeal- Would not recommend-  There was only two other tables in there as well. Sorry- they just did not try-

Service was great when we arrive. Very tasty frozen margarita and the chips and salsa was excellent.  But all downhill after that. Food was sub-par. Tacos were not very good. My son had chimichanga which was stuffed with cheap cheddar cheese. Beans were horrible.  Taco salad was not good either.   Cheap ingredients.  Would not go back

Great Thai and Chinese food. Friendly family staff. We were served by their very cool 11year old son. Kind of place you want to support. Food was excellent and very reasonable. Go for the curry-

I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The owner is very cool and brought us some amazing food at great prices. You must try the crunchy tofu appetizer- delicious. I had the chicken spring salad bowl. Was great. Try the specialty hot tea too. I'll be back next week.

Big shout out to Danish Master Plumber Jay for hooking us back up with hot water! Came out within an hour fixed out water heater at a reasonable price. Fair and honest and a decent guy. If you need a plumber  in scottsdale, Jay is your man!!! Plus his step van is way cool!!

Stopped by for our first time. Server was very friendly and helpful. Happy is crazy good $3 kirin sake bombers  Appetizer calamari was the best we ever had. Entrees we had were Kung pao and a seafood dish. Both very tasty.   Would go back for sure.

Love your restaurant but please get rid of the cheap sriracha sauce from china. I won't eat anything from china. Use the real red rooster sriracha sauce please. Anything else is cheap looking and it doesn't match your restaurant.

This place was a real surprise. Was super crowded but we were seated on the patio right away. Great breakfast food and had turkey and chicken sausage options. Check this place out!!!!
