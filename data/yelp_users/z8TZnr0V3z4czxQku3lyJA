If I could give -5 stars I would. Everytime im in here staff is extremely rude. The lil tech guy behind the counter obviously thinks hes tough s+++. He had a attitude like no other and his whole demeanor is like he gets 100,000 a year to not fix shitty phones. I will not be visiting this store again due to employee's. Management should be ashamed to call that staff. Wouldnt recommended sprint or this location to my worse enemy. You pay for "insurance " just to have to fork over serious cash when a phone defect happens.

Id like to start off by saying as soon I walked in the door I felt at home and as comfortable as I could givin the circumstances of why I was there. (Car accident). I was offered a chilled soda or water while I waited a few moments to have my car inspected. To my surprise I was inspected by the owner of the company. Bob Schubert himself!! I can respect any owner who gets his hands dirty. The front desk staff (Ida, I believe) answered all my needs and was thoroughly impressed with the knowledge she had. After inspection I was told they got it from here. And I know longer had to deal with insurance. They took care of it all. I also recieved updates every week sometimes twice. I was completely aware at all times what stage my insurance, and car were in. They gave me a deadline of when my car would be completed and was done a day ahead of schedule! SCORE! When the car wheeled out upon pickup. To no exaggeration it looked better then before. You cant tell it was ever in a wreck.  But when I got inside I had a nice surprise. A full professional detail, the car was spotless! Show room material. My experience with Impact Auto Body exceeded my expection...blew them out of the water! I would recommend this shop to anyone in a heartbeat! 100 stars would be givin if possible. Thanks Impact for everything.
