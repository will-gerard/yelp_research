Love coming here for team trivia night on Thursdays.  They have Guinness on tap, which makes this girl very happy, and decent irish food.  We love the team trivia guy.

Shout out to a fellow friend on yelp! Thanks for the tip on renting movies here.  Ssshhhh, I know, it's okay.  Got our library card here today.  The librarian was very nice.  Explained all the details and even told us about the free tickets you can get to places in Phoenix, i.e., The Phoenix Zoo, The Botanical Garden, and more.  It is a little small, but the selection is pretty good.  Watching movies tonight!

Love this location!  The employees listen, are great with their knowledge and are more than helpful in getting in what you need.  I had a reward points thing and I kept going back to the same lady three times in one visit.  She was very nice and helped me find what I was looking for.

How does this place have four stars??  Everything was extremely overpriced for the quality and the service was terrible!  Our server was kind (the whole putting the napkin on your lap sort of thing), but he never once engaged in conversation with us and disappeared for at least 10 minutes at a time.  Beware of ordering the Bruschetta if you do not like olives.  They put olives on it, but do not list it on the menu that they do so. Yuck!    It took so long to get any service that we couldn't even order more than one drink the whole evening.  When they give you bread, you should get at least four pieces to split between two people, not three.  The "wine's by the glass" selection was great!  I got the Tuscany Chianti and loved it.  Too bad our server was a ghost to allow me to order more than one glass. Fresh, crisp and flavorful caesar salad.  The lasanga (we split) was at least $5 over-priced; very little meat and barely warm to the touch.  I felt some tension arise when we showed him our Groupon.  I think he made a lot of assumptions about our appearance (look very young) thinking we wouldn't give him a decent tip.  Well, he was right, but not for that reason.  He got a tip, but small because the service was so bad.   Will not go back again.

Love coming here for $20 Tuesday deal; you just can't beat it.  I have to say, the salmon Bruschetta is my favorite of all of them.  The bottle deal can't be beat and the selections are nice. Very broad.  They change it every couple months as well, so always trying new wines.  Highly recommend getting a reservation because it's always packed on Tuesdays.  The service is great, though sometimes, if they are having a bad day, they tend to complain about how busy they are.  While I empathize, I'm here to relax and get away from my work troubles. Just be patient with them and they will treat you right.

This Dairy Queen would have five stars if it was located closer to home. The cookie dough blizzard will always be a favorite!

I belong to a fairly large network group that comes here for breakfast every Wednesday morning.  We have the back room for our use.  I've always been happy with everything I've ordered here.  I pretty much stick to the same breakfast every time and our designated server, Jacque, who always knows what the regulars want.  She is amazing, has the biggest heart and cares about all of her customers.  She has been serving the group for over 15 years and we all love her.

The hostess' were clueless.  We almost left because we waited for almost 20 minutes and she kept the front door open allowing tundra winds to blow in.  There were at least two other tables open when we got to our table.  The server and the food made up for it though, so that is why they get four stars.  I had the chicken soup with a salad.  Crisp, fresh and just the right amount of food with the bread that you can easily fill up on.  We also ordered the lasagna, which was delicious. Cheesy and generous with the meat.

Not perfect, but great job.  Good price and the guy in front doesn't put too much pressure on you to upgrade.  I already know what I want when I go there, so I don't like the upselling pressure. I like the location because it's never super busy.  I can go anytime and not have to wait on average more than 30 minutes.

I absolutely love this pizza.  This is my comparison place when I try other places and I'm still saying Nello's is better.  I've never had a bad pizza here.  Their thin crust pizza is the best and they don't overdo the sauce, so you can still taste the bread of the pizza. Of course the staff is always friendly. Bonus part is being able to have a good red wine here with the pizza. Yum.

My whole family has been seeing Dr. Fritz for a very long time.  The care is the best.  They put you at ease, if you are a wimp like me, making sure you do not experience any pain for any dental work done. Beware of other companies trying to sell you on dental work you don't need.  Dr. Fritz is the most honest dentist who will never make you feel bad and never, ever require you to get dental work done you don't need.  He is always current and learning new things about the dental industry so you can be sure he is not stuck in 1970 pulling teeth that can be saved. He cares about each and every one of his customers. There is no one else I'd refer anyone to.

Orange Patch is very nice. Their oranges are to die for and the staff are very friendly. I will be purchasing fresh Arizona Citrus from Orange Patch for the rest of my life! These oranges are coming from trees that are over a 100 years old. Simply the best!

I really enjoyed this place.  The service is great and the pizza is very, very good.  Our server was friendly, courteous and checked on us at all the right times.  I would say the price range is average.  It's a super casual place, so you wouldn't look out of place if you walked in there with your hair uncombed wearing sweats. They do not serve alcohol, but they do have a killer brownie and gelato.  The garlic bread appetizer is simple, but yummy.  We had a large pizza with half what I wanted and half what my friend wanted.  The thing I tend to dislike about pizza places (but worth it if the pizza is fantastic) is the wait once you order it.  The pizza was brought to us in about only 10 minutes.  Very impressed with the whole thing.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is first, the tables were too close together.  I'm not loud, but I shouldn't have to whisper either, so there really is no seat in the place to have a private discussion with your party.  I understand they want as much business as they can, but when the lady at the table next to me snickers at something I said, I think it's time to take a table or two out.  Second, I like my crust with a little bit of a crisp or crunch.  This pizza crust was really soft. It might be more a preference issue though, so more of a heads up if you like it the way I like it.   Now, if only they had a small wine selection to complete the package.  :)

Forgive me for my delay in updating my review.   Chelsea's kitchen really values their patrons having a positive and enjoyable dining experience.  Within about 24 hours from my original post, I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing for our "just okay" visit.  She gave us a gift certificate to go back.  We took up the offer and returned for a full dining experience.   We were extremely impressed.  I have to say our waitress, Jessica, probably provided the best service I have ever received, at least the best I can remember in a very long time.  She was able to read us to know whether we were there for a quick dine or relaxed long dine.  I had a red wine that was delicious. We ordered the fish tacos and a hamburger.  Keep in mind, the price is more on the high end, but they delivered on taste and presentation. The food was brought at the right time.  I get nervous when the food at a place like this is delivered too quickly... I will definitely be returning as the food, service and ambiance is deserving of a 5 star review.

Went here on a Sunday night.  Beautiful ambiance and a nice size bar, too.  The service was amazing.  You could tell they care about providing the best service to their customers.  We told her we were yelping and she said awesome. She gave us an extra treat for doing so.  I ordered the curry dish, asked for thai hot and they delivered.  It was so delicious I could not stop eating it.  We also ordered the chimichanga which was full of flavor, all kinds of ingredients, perfectly fried.   We are looking forward to returning very soon.

The food was amazing and Sylvia (I believe to be the owner) was super friendly, even calling us by our first names.  I had the Shish combo. It's definitely enough for two meals, so second half sitting my fridge for tomorrow.  The pastacio baklava is delicious with lots of nuts. The place was packed and completely understaffed, so it was understandable that it took some time to pay the bill.  I don't think I'll have room for dinner.  The prices are reasonable considering it really is two meals.  I will absolutely be going back in the near future.

Only go to this location during the snowbird off-season.  Otherwise, you'll be playing bumper cars in the parking lot, standing in the pharmacy line that goes around the building twice and waiting twenty minutes in the check out line for the senior in front of you to write a personal check for milk, eggs and Dulcolax.

Great wifi. Cool airplanes on the ceiling. The lobby next to the restaurant is great for casual business meetings. It is a little on the pricy side for meals. The view of the runway and planes is nice.   It seems to always be busy during lunch. I will be going back.

This is my favorite Subway in the valley. It is near work and they know my sandwich. They are very friendly and I believe their sandwiches are better than other Subway locations. They do not skimp on the veggies and toast the bread just right. Try the Subway Melt toasted with pepper jack. Yumm.

Absolutely THE most honest mechanic you'll ever go to.  I always take my vehicle here and recommend them to everyone.  They do not cheat you, offer you a great price, show and explain what you need done and why.  Randy and Russ are very honest people. They never "recommend" having work done that I do need.

Well,  I really like my color, but I'm not sure if I like the color at my roots or the color on the ends. I won't be going back.  First of all, when I go to a pricier hair salon I don't want my hair person to be doing other people's hair in between unless it's a quick guy's cut while my hair color is lifting.   I actually called a month before and left a message to set an appointment and they never called me back.  Bad business, should have been a sign.   The girl I saw was really nice and a pleasure to chit chat with.  MIght be more fun over coffee instead of my head.  I told her I hate, hate, hate red and when I got home the first thing my dad said is, "It's red."  ARRRGGGHHHH I had a coupon, so I said yes to the blow dry.  The blow dry was 28 bucks and she did a half-ass job.  It was the worst style I ever had.  Had I known I could have used my coupon for product too I would have used it for that instead of wasting it on a crappy blow dry.   It's not the worst color, and luckily some of the brassiness will tone down after a few washes, but I still won't be going back.   I'm so glad I didn't let her cut my hair.  I got my hair cut at Focal Point Salon near Desert Ridge and it was the best haircut EVER and I am a pain in the butt when it comes to haircuts.  I will be getting my color there next time and looking forward to it.  I do not recommend this salon if you do a full color and expect it to be the same from root to end.

I love this place.  I never have a bad anything here.  I know there are other locations, but this one is by far the best.  Everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing every single time.  I go about once a month on average and the entire staff greets me like I was just there yesterday.  You cannot beat the price anywhere else and they have my favorite saki.

This Thai food is the best I have had in the east valley.  I've ordered from here a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  The amount of food you get is enough for a couple meals for me. The rangoons are pretty amazing, too.  I'm not a big fan of red curry, so if I'm in a curry mood I'll go with the yellow. If you call in your order for pick-up and they say 10 minutes, it's 10 minutes, at the most.  They are very friendly there.  I've never dined in before, but the place is really cute. I love all the trinkets. Some day I'll dine in. :P

The service was great, but the food was meh.  We had the bruchetta as an appetizer.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  They SHOULD be considering it's an italian resturant.  We ordered the shrimp lobster fettuccini to share.  Well, there was only one tiny piece of lobster. One piece of lobster does not make it a shrimp, lobster fettuccini, so of course my dinner partner was sweet enough to give me the one tiny piece.  The sauce was just okay.  Could have used more flavor.  On a plus side, the bread is pretty awesome.  Too bad it looks so pretty on the inside.  Won't be enough to bring me back unless there are no other options and it's extremely convenient.

Loved it!  I had the Farmers salad and they were very accommodating to my requests to change the salad a bit.  Nice choices of organic wines as well.  I had the Chardonnay and it was yummy.  I went by myself to read a book and the server was respectful of the alone time I was there for.  I will definitely go back again to try something else.

ORIGINAL REVIEW(SEE BELOW FOR REVISIT): Disappointed, extremely. Terrible food and terrible service. Nice looking, but definitely not returning. We got there a little before happy hour, were seated quickly and asked the server what the specials were. She showed us the board above the bar that said Landshark. We decided to order a 24 ouncer to share until happy hour. She came back and said they were out so we ordered a Shock Top instead. We both ordered Kobe style burgers and mine order came out wrong, not kobe. They sent it back, got the right order back pretty quickly, except missing my roasted peppers (which were not roasted, but tiny pieces in a dressing cup) and french fries.  Both of our burgers were very dry and flavorless, not what you'd expect from a place that specializes in burgers. We actually put quite a bit a salt to try and get some flavor out of it.  We told the server we would have two more Shock Tops IF we could get them at the happy hour special price (since they didn't have the main beer they promote available). She said okay, she was sure she could do that. We got the bill and she did not give us the special on the beers we asked for.  She said she could get the manager but he wouldn't do anything, so we said forget it, paid the bill and left, won't be back. Honestly, if the burgers were as amazing as we expected them to be, we wouldn't have made a bit of a stink about the beers.  Good luck staying in business when you have very poor service AND very poor food.  REVIEW AFTER SECOND VISIT: I was contacted by the owner, Lee, who had seen my review (above) to give it a second shot.  His business is his passion and wants to make sure everyone who visits has a great meal as well as great service every time. We decided to give it another shot and it was a complete turn around.  The service was impeccable and the burgers were better. Laura was there to take care of all our needs.  Whatever we requested, i.e., make the fries that come with the kobe style burger, cheddar cheese chili style was done.  We did have to add a little salt and pepper, but they were much juicer this time.  The green chili on the burger is delicious!  I would say because the food was better and everyone involved truly cared that we were dissatisfied, we will be making return visits in the future.  Thank you Lee, Laura and Kyle (very nice bartender) for treating us as, well, pretty much like royalty.  We look forward to returning and sharing this experience with our friends.

This place is so fun.  I love how it's never super busy, but just enough people to make for an entertaining night.  It's definitely not your typical Scottsdale bar. Much more low key with super friendly patrons. It's pretty small, but there is a cute outdoor seating area in case you want a little more space.  They usually have a live acoustic music to entertain you. The bartender Doug, is great.  Never have a bad time and they have great specials even after happy hour.

I love this place!  I live in east Mesa/East Gilbert area, so it's definitely a drive, but totally worth it.  It's also very pricey ($65 just for a cut), but again, totally worth it.  Mikey (woman) cut my hair the best over anyone that has ever cut my hair.  No kidding.  I'm kind of a pain when it comes to my haircut because my hair is curly.  I like to style it straight and curly so I need someone who listens to me as how I like my hair cut because I'm the only one who knows how my hair curls.  She cut it exactly the way I wanted and managed to rid all of the dead ends.  THAT is a professional! Everyone there is super friendly and fun.  They also give you wine as a beverage choice.  DUH on that one! I just got my hair colored at Rolfs (only cause I had a coupon) and won't be going back there. Terrible!  Looking forward to Mikey coloring my hair next time.  If you are paranoid about getting a cut and have been waiting over a year and a half because of it, like me, get to Mikey asap! You will not be disappointed.

A definite fav!  We love, love, love the burgers.  You have to get the sweet and spicy burger.  It is just amazing.  Sweet, spicy, crunchy, juicy with a soft bun. It is a little pricey, but we go when we have a groupon, so it's a much better deal. The service has been stellar both times.  They answer all of our questions about the food and beverages. Will be going back again....with a groupon.  Also, if you do check in here, you get a 15% discount you can redeem anytime.

This place is fun.  It's always packed when I go. The chicken lollipops are awesome and so is the grilled cheese sandwich. The articoke dip is NASTY though.  Tastes like canned soup. Bleh!  I met a girlfriend up there for happy hour and you can't beat the prices, especially for Scottsdale. The staff is always super friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel like you are an important customer even with a full house.  I love sitting on the upstairs patio during this time of year. The only thing I hate is the hassle of finding a decent parking spot.

I went here for my birthday with my parents.  What a fun place.  The sushi is great, clean and the server was very attentive to our needs.  We got to sit where ever we wanted and was greeted with a smile. My dad and I ordered the all you can eat sushi, of which I ordered way too much of course. I wouldn't say the sushi is THE best sushi I've ever had, but I would go to this place over Kona or Ra in a heartbeat.  The prices are great and they don't really mind if you share a bit of your "all you can eat" with someone else at your table.  You can actually reserve your own set of chopsticks if you are a regular.  Happy hour prices are reasonable with a great selection of sake.  Only Sakana has my favorite though.  They gave me moochi for my birthday, which I love! They take your picture, let you write something on your photo and put it on their wall when you walk it.  Pretty cool and fun experience.  The only thing I didn't like was the Spurs winning game 5 that day.   On a side note, I accidently left my sunglasses there, didn't realize it for a couple days and they hung on to them until I was able to pick them up almost a week later.  That was a really spetacular thing they did.

Went here for lunch the other day.  Place was dead, which was fine with me because we got excellent service.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  I had the Cobb salad.  Crisp, fresh with lots of toppings. It was a very generous size.  I was able to take it home and have it for lunch the next day.  They have Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer! YUMMY!  Going back for lunch very soon.

Nice set-up for just dining, hanging out at the bar and playing billiards.  Regulation tables that are very clean and level.  All the sticks are good quality, so a great place to practice your skills.  Lots of TV's, so great place for a game night to drink, play billiards, even darts and eat some yummy food.  Had the chicken quesadilla.  Filling, cheesy, and decently priced.  Patrons of all ages. Will go back soon.

I love this place!!  The bread is nice and soft, meat delicious, fresh toppings.  They slice the meat fresh right before you eyes for your sandwich.  It's actually fun.  The employees are fun and friendly. If you ask to sample something they will gladly cut you a slice. I like to try all the sandwiches and haven't been disappointed yet.  I usually get a regular with everything on it and save half for lunch the next day.  Sometimes the line is long, but they are very efficient in servicing the customers.

We walked in past nine in the evening and the manager, Jim, was excited to see two new patrons.  He had us try some samples of the horchata and this mint lime drink.  Everything was fresh and made from scratch each day.  He was very excited to tell us about all the great things and helped us figure out what we wanted to eat. We ordered the carnitas burrito with everything (they have fresh jalapenos) in it, including the enchilada sauce on top. It  was very filling, tasted fresh and had lots of flavors.  We also ordered the carnita tostada, with the whole wheat tostada.  It was more like a big salad, but it was pretty good.  I would get shredded beef next time because the carnitas did not blend well with the other flavors of the tostada taco.  Jim is right; the horchata is the best in town.  Would stop by just for that.

We had localdines deal we used to check it out for the first time.  Well, be careful when going to a place that automatically charges a gratuity.  Typically this means the service will be sub-par at best.  Bingo!  It took forever to get our first drinks. So long we had time to read through the whole menu.  He did seem nice enough, but just mosied around the place.  It really wasn't terribly busy.  Ordered the hamberguesa and the grilled fish tacos.  The fish tacos were good, but the hamberguesa will leave you feeling the results later...ah!  Anyway, it took so long to get a second round of drinks one of us went to the bar to cancel order and ask for the check.  We were already done eating by then.  He did ask if everything was okay, so nice attempt, but we just wanted to leave after seeing the bill included the tip.  It does not create incentive for giving exceptional service.  This town is tough for restaurants!

Maybe because it's a new location they have not got the kinks worked out yet.  We sat in the bar area.  The server took almost 30 mins to come back to take our order after we told him we wanted to order food.  We shared the general Li's dish and asked them to split it.  They just brought  an extra plate.  That's okay, but actually placing the meal on two separate plates would have been a nice extra step and a lot less messy for us.  They were a little stingy with the rice, too.  Not really enough for the rest of the ingredients to balance out the soy sauce, so it turned out too salty.  Tip: ask for extra rice.

Just tried the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special. You really can't beat the deal for what you get. It comes with rice, spring roll, rangoon (very yummy) and egg drop soup, all for six bucks, including tax.   I ordered it to go and they brought me the soup to eat while I waited for my food; that makes for good service. The ingredients were fresh, though they should have cooked the veggies a little longer.  The Kung Pao chicken wasn't anything special. I would have liked it to be spicy, but it was still good.  I will go back because I want to try their Pho.

Amazing! And have only been open for a couple months. Staff is very attentive. Eggrolls, pretzels, minus the cheese -still experimenting for perfect cheese sauce- extra large wings, have Papago Orange Blossom Beer and have a fire pit to make your own S, mores. Bomb!
